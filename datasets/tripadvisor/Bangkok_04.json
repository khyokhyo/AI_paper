Driver was waiting for us a few minutes early (bonus points) in our hotel lobby -luxury van ready to roll for our private tour! Actually because of the price we thought it was going to be a group tour. Driver was great and we picked up wonderful guide \"Bow\". Did the floating market (tourist trap) and they let us cut that short because at the last minute my wife wanted to see the baby tiger! So for a very small adder we were whisked off to play with and feed a baby tiger. Then on to the elephant camp where riding bareback and getting wet was the highlight of our entire trip!!!I suggest booking with these guys - you won't regret it. Next trip I am considering hiring their van and driver for custom tours because it is first class all the way!"

Wow, wow, wow, is all I can say. Such an awesome experience, a must do and worth every penny. Kent and Joe were our private tour guides and driver for the day. They picked us up at the hotel and took us to the floating markets, then to the bridge, afterwards we were taken to have lunch and then spent the last part of our trip with the elephants. Riding the elephants on their back backs was such an amazing experience. You feel nervous and excited all at the same time. Kent and Joe were amazing as they also became our videographer and photographer during the whole excursion. Thank you for making this such an epic trip, definitely the highlight to our entire trip in Thailand!!!"

Arranged it all in UK by email and deposit transfer. They have a standard tour inc bridge over river kwai and a market with hotel pick up. We arranged for airport pick up (off redeye from london) then drove straight to the elephants 3hours as this was our priority. A great elephant sanctuary. we rode and swam with our elephants with mahouts. had plenty of time with them in the water bareback. Top tip: dont worry what you look like wear a thin shirt and trousers. there are showers so a complete change of clothes and a polly bag does the trick. i also wore light dive shoes for grip. Elephant hair is wire like and if you are up close it could hurt you legs for the rest of your holiday. My elephant Ma, held me on with her ears when we went downhill into the river. our guide spoke excellent english and told us all about culture and took great photos for us. it was just us 2."

            "review": "Elephant/ Tiger Tour. We booked this tour extremely last minute and they were grateful enough to facilitate our request, which was a major benefit. A deposit of 4000THB was required through PayPal and the next day they picked us up. The tour included the feeding of leopard Cubs as well lion cubs which was more than worth it! Followed up by a quick safari tour of the reminder of the animals and giraffe feeding! It included breakfast (sandwiches and chips) and a traditional Thai lunch. In regards to the lunch, everyone has a set menu which was extremely delicious but I guess that could be a problem for some. Lastly for the elephant ride, the bonus of the tour is that we walked straight to the front of the already growing line and proceeded with our elephant ride. Life changing to say the least. I don't see how anyone could mess that up to be honest. The only issue with this tour is that it's 2-3 hours away from Bangkok, but on the plus side they take you everywhere you need to go. If you can't handle really long car rides, I would give this option a second guess."

Our personal guide Bow was above and beyond anything we had imagined.

It is a 2 hour ride from Bangkok to the first attraction, then slowly work your way to finish with the elephant riding.

I was able to walk an 8 month old tiger on a walk around the jungle and then was able to hold Chanel (baby lion), Gucci (baby leopard) and the highlight for me. Miss Louis Vuitton (baby tiger)! I was able to feed them each a bottle and then play with them. It was truly a magical day for me. We then went to an elephant camp and I was able to ride an elephant and then play with the elephant in the river. I was scared to death to ride the elephant, the elephant trainer and my guide were very kind and patient and let me get off when I was ready. The elephant tour ended and I was able to feed and pet a baby elephant. My guide and driver were fantastic, I couldn't have asked for better. Truly, an amazing, beautiful experience! I can't recommend this tour enough!!"

            "review": "Damnoen Saduak floating market and Ayutthaya temples. My husband and I booked this tour on our last day in Thailand and were very happy with the experience. Our guide was wonderful and very informative. This tour does have a good amount of drive time (90 minutes to the markets and then two hours from there to the temples and another hour or so back) but the drive was pleasant and the van was comfortable. This floating market is mainly tourists, but that was fine for us since we still needed to get gifts for people from home, but if you are looking for an authentic Thai experience then you would probably do better at a weekend market. The tour includes 3 ancient temples, two of which are mostly ruins, so if you want glittering gold this is not for you but if you're more into history then this is perfect and you can still see a lot of art details on the 1st and third temple."

            "review": "Not for those who care. Transfer service was private and great, brdige over river kwai was great to see and floating market was good fun. Lunch was also good although drinks arent included (which at over \u00a3100 pp is a bit silly). However the elephant experience itself is not something I would repeat. I was concerned about welfare before booking this but booked based on the positive reviews (no mention of neglect), hoping that the fact the trip was quite expensive would mean the elephants werelooked after and not just constantly on the go. I didnt see neglect per say but definately not what was expected - elephant ride itself was very short and just through clump of brush nearby so not really a trek. Was most looking forward to bathing the elephants - but this was just the mahouts giving the elephants commands over and over again to dunk us and spray water etc. I wanted to just spend some time with these fantastic animals, a bit more naturally, but didnt get the chance. We also only got about 25 mins with the elephants in total rather than the 1 hour advertised. I brought this up and recieved a partial refund but then had issues as the amount came through to my account was significantly lower than that agreed and on bringing this up was not recieved very well. Give the elephants a miss - you will feel better for it. And if you would still like to see the market etc there are other trips that can be booked for 1/4 the price."

            "review": "Don't do the tiger cub feeding or elephant ride!!!. I booked the elephant riding and tiger cub feeding tour, which had the cemetery and train track included. I was very disappointed with this tour, especially because it was so expensive.Although Ken came to pick me up on time and I had the cab to myself and it was air conditioned, within 10mins of my journey, I was told that I would not be feeding tigers but leopards. Ken then spent the next 30 minutes, trying to convince me to feed the leopards, but I refused to settle for something that I did not pay for. Eventually he called through to his head office and they agreed to let me feed the tiger cub. Great right! (keep reading).Once at the safari park for the tiger cub feeding, I was given a bus all to myself and I could feed the giraffes too. As we drove through the safari park it was dry and bare. The animals that were there looked sedated as they just laid in the sun unmoving. Ken said it was because they were too tired, but the big cats and bears looked sedated to me - I could be wrong. The giraffes scared me (I can laugh about it now). Four giraffes came in the bus to get the food, I thought they would attack me - they didn't, but Ken laughed at me which wasn't very helpful - but I'm sure it was funny.The Safari park was quiet and Ken made a point to mention that people from England don't usually come on the tour anymore and that the tours have been quite quiet - don't go, I wouldn't advise anyone to go, from England or anywhere. I saw one baby tiger; he was on a leash the entire time I was with him. I fed him for about 2 minutes and then walked him for about 2 minutes. The handler was there at all times. He took pictures of us which were very nice, but I felt sorry for the tiger, he looked unhappy and he had no freedom. His handler was quite mean to him too.We then went for lunch and Ken left me to sit by myself, whilst he sat with the other tour guides and drivers, which was fine, but I didn't like the food that much and I still had to pay for drinks, as drinks were not included in the tour - which I thought was poor because the tour was so expensive already.Next we went to the elephant ride. I urge everyone not to do this!!!! The elephants were old and looked tired. As I got on the back of the one I was riding, I saw to holes in his head that looked like injection holes. I was not impressed. I didn't like the experience of being on the elephant either, so I took pictures and then got down immediately. I wish I went to the elephant sanctuary in Chiang Mai like a friend of mine did. You don't get to ride the elephants but you get to play with them and get up close and personal. One thing I learnt from the elephant sanctuary was that the elephants needed mud on them, as a form of sunscreen. Unfortunately, the elephants here had no mud on them and they were in chains. As you wait for an elephant to be available to ride, there is an elephant in a pen who is there for picture purposes. He looked very unhappy and had no space to roam. He was stuck in this tiny pen unable to move around. All in all, it was a horrible experience and I don't think the animals were being treated well. I'm not the biggest animal lover, but any injustice and unfair treatment/cruelty to animals makes me feel uncomfortable and that is how I felt all day on this tour. If you want to experience tigers and elephants, I would say go to the places in Chiang Mai, I had friends that I met in Bangkok who went there and they loved it and from the pictures the animals looked happy. If I didn't book this tour in advance and paid so much money, I would have gone to Chiang Mai, but you live and you learn. I would not recommend this tour or using Bangkok Day Tours either for animal tours, I think the animals are unfairly treated and if people continue to pay for these tours, I doubt the treatment of the animals will improve. It felt like everyone just wanted to make their money, they didn\u2019t appear to care about the animals at all.Ken was very pleasant and tired his hardest to ensure I had a good day, but I couldn't help think he was covering up for the company and their mistreatment of animals."

            "review": "Elephant Tour . We pre booked this trip as a 60th birthday gift for my husband. What a wonderful experiences with many happy memories for us to talk about when we get home. After an early start of 7.00 am pick up by our driver Tong we drove for approximately 1.5 hours to the floating market in Dumneon. Unusual way to shop and not as busy as the canals in Bangkok. Picked up a couple of bargains after bartering for a good price. Next stop was Bridge over River Kwai. A must see on a trip to Thialand. We were lucky to watch a train arrive at the station then travel over the bridge. Has become very commercialised and probably spoils the memory of the bridge . Next a stop for traditional Thai lunch at a roadside restuarant . Good food but too much . We then headed off for another 1hours drive into the mountains for our trip to the elephants. Our tour guide H tried to teach us commands for the elephants during the drive up. We decided to ride bareback on the elephants. It was a bit scary at first and thought we would fall off with every step the elephant took. Managed to relax and hold on for the 30 mins . Mahoot travelled with us and guided the elephant round while H (tour guide ) took control of our camera with many memorable shots . Finally arrived at the river and spent about 20 mins in the water with mahouts and elephants. Fantastic experience ."

            "review": "Memories for ever....... We booked the floating markets, Bridge on the River Kwai and Tiger Cub, Wildlife Sanctuary Safari tour for my wife, myself and town kids (14 & 18) and it was a great experience.Mixed emotions of the three elements, the culture of the market, the depth of feeling of the bridge and the care at the wildlife sanctuary.The day started from our hotel in Bangkok at 7am met by our guide Bo and her driver. She was very knowledgable throughout the tour and made it feel that it was 'our day'.The floating market was a cool experience not to be missed, if you take pictures you will love the backgrounds and the faces.The Bridge was an opportunity to understand the sacrifice of so many and to pay respect. Possibly too touristy now but recommend watching the 'old' film with Sir Alec Guiness either before or after a visit.After this time for lunch which was great traditional Thai food and most enjoyable in nice surroundings.Then on to part which surpassed everything! The wildlife sanctuary and the leopard Cubs plus more! The most impressive thing here is the animals are cared for and looked after in a good environment. The opportunity to play with the Cubs and get down close with them was a once in a lifetime experience we will never forget. But then to take the bus through the park and have the photo opportunities was unreal!But the cherry on the cake was the giraffes, up close and personal to feed, the leopard Cubs are cute but these guys are big and gentle!Fabulous day!"

First I was scared as they elephant was so high but they took me a show me how that the elephants were safe and happy and told me on 28years they never had anyone fall off. So we went ahead and bathe with the elephants. The elephants were so happy. They were flapping their ears. No miss treatment here!! No mahoots hitting elephants or the bad stuff- that was great.Super enjoyable!!Thank you Molly and driver you made our day!!"

They came and picked us up at our hotel at 8am and drove outside of Bangkok about 2 hours, picking up our tour guide Na on the way. She was a riot! So much fun and full of interesting facts and info. We first toured the bridge and learned some history about it. Na took so many pictures with our phones, she's an excellent photographer and knew all the spots for the best shots. She basically took over the picture taking so we could enjoy the tour. Following the bridge, Na took us to a great complimentary lunch at this little hotel on the river. It was so tranquil And peaceful, and the food was amazing! We got a couple beers there too for a little extra baht. Then we drove over to the sanctuary and got in a little safari bus to which the animals come up to eat the food provided by the tour. We saw giraffes, deer, zebras, lions, tigers and leopards. The last three we didn't feed. Then at the end, you have the option to feed the baby Cubs for an extra 300 bt a pop. We decided to feed the baby tiger and the leopards.. Which were definitely not at all sedated, which was good! I was happy to see the animals treated respectfully! The Cubs were sooo cute and definitely wild, but we were not scared! We fed and played with them for a while with Na taking photos and the handler keeping watch. One thing I didn't know was the Elephants you see in all the photos in the water with people, is a totally DIFFERENT tour and if you choose the sanctuary, you do not see the elephants. I saw they had some you can ride there somewhere but we didn't do that so we didn't see any. Next time I would love to try the elephant tour. Huge shout out to Na for being so awesome! Tipping is highly recommended as well for the guide and a little something for the driver."

We have done animal encounter before and really enjoyed them and chose this company based on the reviews. Initially, we were disappointed to find out that the Tiger Temple was closed (out of their control), but the tour company contacted us immediately and gave us another tour option. So, our tour consisted of the Safari Zoo petting the lion, leopard and tiger cubs, walking with the older leopards and the giraffe encounter. And we visited the Elephant Farm in the afternoon. We were picked up at our hotel promptly at 0600. He was very friendly and spoke decent English. Along the way, we picked our tour guide, Na. Wow. She made the tour even ten times better. I am an avid world traveller and she is the BEST tour guide that I have ever had. She was beyond knowledgeable and took over my iPhone for the day. It's like paying a professional photographer and animal trainer to tour with you. And it was a private tour with only the two of us. By the end of the day, I had hundreds of photos and videos of memories of our trip. And she handles the animals so beautifully. I could go on and on but I can finish by saying that you will not regret booking one of their tours."

            "review": "Best part of our stay in Bangkok!. My husband and I were recently in Bangkok for ~4 days as part of the 2nd leg of our honeymoon. We had booked Tour #1118 - Floating Market, Bridge over River Kwai, Tiger Temple, and then the Elephants. We loved our tour guide, Ken, who shared his knowledge on Thai culture/history during the drive, and seemed genuinely enthusiastic about everything. He took great care of us and made sure we got plenty of pictures at each attraction. Often times he even offered to carry my purse for me so I could roam about freely. Ken asked us our preferences and let us know that if we wanted to spend more time at a certain attraction, then he would cater the tour to our needs so we could spend more time with what we were interested in. The tour started off with a ~1.5 hour drive out to the Floating Markets. We got there early enough to avoid the crowds and leisurely enjoy the paddle boat ride throughout the market. Ken also asked if we were interested in getting some photos with snakes and a cute little lemur monkey, and of course I volunteered! After the Floating Markets it was another ~1 hour drive out to the Bridge over River Kwai, where we walked across the bridge and then had a nice Thai buffet lunch. Ken created a sampler plate of Thai desserts for us to try, and everything was so delicious! We got coconut ice cream cones to go. From there, it was about another 30-40 mins to the Tiger Temple. Again, Ken made sure we got plenty of pictures. Then finally, we had our last stop of the day with the elephants, which was about another 30 min drive from the Tiger Temple. It was a 3-4 hour drive back into Bangkok (we stayed at The Peninsula), but luckily our SUV car was very comfortable so my husband and I both fell asleep during the ride. We would highly recommend this tour to anyone planning a trip to Bangkok, and definitely recommend Ken as your tour guide!"

My tour, arranged on short notice, included the floating market, the Bridge over the River Kwai and elephant \"experience\". The floating market was interesting and from a historical (and beautiful setting) perspective, the Kwai River Bridge is just a great place to see.My guide Bo (photo attached), was most knowledgeable of every location and charming/engaging. The excellent driver, Mr. Ho and his vehicle/large van, great for touring. The elephant ride and river swim was probably one of the most unique \"life's experiences\" ever. Outstanding mahout and thanks to Bo, great photos/videos of my elephant ride/swim. I cannot recommend Bangkok Day Tours any higher, just the best."

            "review": "AMAZING DAY/EXPERIENCE Recommend for anyone. I was happy and smiling all day from ear to ear with our English speaking guides Joe and Na!Itinerary: Extraordinary Elephant Day Tour. *note this is actually a private tour for how many are in your party when you book it...something I didn't realize until we were picked up by our driver in the morning. Highlights/Pros: 1) Private, large, comfortable van and English speaking tour guides the entire day (no changing of tour guides along the way). 2) Experienced tour guides who gave us tips on how to make the most of our time/day at each location, took our photos quickly, efficiently, and knew how to take the photos to make the most scenic, beautiful and memorable ones with our personal devices.3) Meeting, bathing, and riding the elephants at the end of the day. Things to note that I didn't prior to booking:1) each destination for the day can be quite far from each other...anywhere from 1-2 hours of driving, and then at the end of the day it's a straight 4 hours return to Bangkok. Come prepared with a book, or something to do if you can't hold conversation or enjoy scenery/music along the way.2) This is a private tour for you and the number that you book it for. So you won't be meeting up with strangers like a normal \"tour\" company does. Things to know in general:1) There are ways to charge your personal devices in the van if you need to, in addition to tour guides having portable power bank chargers. You may just have to bring your charging cord with the USB on one side.2) if you're a snacker, bring or buy snacks at the floating market to last you the day.3) drink plenty of water, the van will always be stocked with water in the mini cooler. and use sunscreen.4) When at the floating market, the boat driver will stop at certain kiosks, you will be pressured into buying something. If you don't want to buy it, just say no thank you and ask your driver to move on and vice versa if you see something you want to eat/buy."

I cannot sign enough praise for our tour guide, Na. She was positively amazing!! Our tour started in the very early hours of the morning (getting picked up at 4:30 am) but she was teeming with energy and excitement from the moment we met her all the way until we were forced to part ways. She was exceedingly knowledgable about everything we did, such as the history of the Bridge of Kwai River. Beyond that, Na could be a professional photographer. She spent the entirety of our tour together with both our camera and our phone (at the same time!!) snapping pictures and taking video, and we came out with some breath-taking pictures to help document such a wonderful day. We never felt rushed or pushed to do anything, and Na made sure we got our fill of everything that we possibly could before moving on to the next step. As we went on other tours in other parts of Thailand, my companion and I couldn't help but compare these other guides to Na and always feel that she was far superior. We wish we could have taken her with us everywhere! Thank you Na, for making such a wonderful trip even better than we could have dreamed."

My husband and I booked the day trip that started with Kateyada (nicknamed Nuch?) picking us up at the hotel with the driver (Mr O). We asked how many others were on the trip and we were the only ones! So we effectively got a private tour! The Floating Markets were the first stop. Kateyada took loads of photos of us both all day. Mr O was lovely too - quiet but with a great sense of humour that came out about an hour into the tour. We then headed to the Bridge over the river Kwai. Again plenty of pictures and walked across the bridge. Then wonderful buffet lunch in a fabulous floating restaurant. Best lunch we've had on a tour I might add! Then the complete highlight of the day. The Tigers. Wow! If you do nothing else in Bangkok you MUST see these. The most amazing experience of both our lives - with half my phone's memory taken up with photos of us with them. We walked one to the photo area then got pictures with us behind (ie touching) about 6 or so of the different tigers. Then on to the Elephants - which were great but unfortunately the Tigers were so amazing that we found the Elephants a little less interesting because of it. But we had a ride and then fed our elephant a bucket of Bananas as thanks. The trip with Bangkok Day Tours isn't cheap - but I can tell you it is worth every penny. They take fantastic care of you, ensure you are comfortable and go that extra mile all day. They provide cold bottles of water, some snacks if you want them, lunch, hold your bags while you sit for photos, provide lots of info all day long. Kateyada even had a phone charger that charged up my phone half way through the day to ensure it was full for photos all day long. She was a complete delight and I thoroughly recommend both Her, Mr O (our driver) and BDT's if you want a great unforgettable day."

Booking was seamless and all the information was there easily accessible and understandable. We met our driver and our guide Sally in the lobby. Sally was fantastic, very knowledgeable and a very talented photographer! We have some of our best photos (as a couple overall!) thanks to Sally and they're still in frames and albums everywhere. That was really great, she captured our enjoyment perfectly.The Bridge and the River Kwai was very sobering and interesting to see. We even got to stand on the side as a train went over! It was en enlightening experience.The Tiger temple was great fun. Being able to experience donating to the monks was a treat. The tigers from babies to full grown adults were mostly well behaved (there were some cheeky nippy ones!) and so adorable. Truly an experience I'll never forget. I'm very glad we did this tour as part of being able to get there early, we washed them and played with them and walked them. It was unforgettable.The elephant ride was great fun if not a little scary at the beginning. The handlers were fantastic. I couldn't believe they'd take us down to the river and we could splash around with them! They threw us around with their trunks, sprayed us, sloshed around with us. Some of the most fun I've ever had. The vehicle and the drive was very comfortable. Thank you Sally and Bangkok Day Tours for an experience I will never forget!!"

We were a little disappointed that there were no tiger cubs (they have not had Cubs for 9 months) but we still got to feed the younger tigers milk via a baby bottle which was lovely. Lots of photo opportunities and really enjoyed playing with the Tigers in their enclosure. Felt absolutely safe the whole time - the volunteer Thai women will protect you at all costs!! We must say though that the highlight of our day was swimming with the elephants - what amazing creatures they are - gentle giants. Our Tour Guide for the day was Bo - what a delightful young lady she is. Bo made sure that we did not miss a thing and she is the BEST photographer. It was like we had our own private photographer for the day. Jo was our driver and he was extremely good at it. We had the van all to ourselves and it was so comfortable. It had all the mod cons and we were able to watch our videos of the day in the car on the way home. The tour wasn't cheap but we feel that it was totally worth every cent."

Selected the triple-play tour #1511 which covered an early morning visit to The River Kwai Bridge, then a full 3-4 hours with the monks and Tigers at Tiger Temple, and finishing up the day with an elephant ride and bathing/playing in the river. Realize the this is a 4:30 AM start so be prepared since you are covering a lot in one day. Based on previous TA Reviews, requested 'Bo' as the Tour Guide. Perfect choice. Great command of English, friendly, knowledgeable, and was a tremendous help acting as a photographer for me since I was a solo traveler. Can't thank her enough for that as the pictures are outstanding. the van driver Tong also was super, courteous, and kind.The day started at 4:30 AM. Tong was waiting in the hotel lobby right on time. Pleasantly surprised to find I had a mini-bus completely to myself very comfortable and spacious and great air conditioning. We set off, picked up our tour guide 'Bo' along the way, and in 2 hours we were at the River Kwai Bridge. We took photos, walked the length of the bridge, then started our journey to Tiger Temple. Tong had purchased a small pre-breakfast for me as well so I had some extra food to eat before the Tiger Temple.At Tiger Temple we enjoyed buffet breakfast with the monks while surrounded by Tigers. We were able to bottle feed the 6 Tigers in the Temple here and take loads of pictures up close. We then took turns walking a Tiger to their bathing spot and each person had a chance to wash and hand feed them. We then walked an adult Tiger (over 2 years) down to their pool/play area where we each got our 'head in lap' photos. After this, we watched 4 Tigers jump, swim, and play in their pool before heading to the Elephant Park. Awesome stuff!At the elephant park, we started with a bareback ride down into the River Kwai where I was lifted several times by the elephant's trunk and dropped back into the river. What fun! I even was able to stand on the elephants head and jump off. I then rode the elephant out or the river and around the park for 15 min.The day finished with an excellent buffet Thai lunch around 1 PM before heading out on the long journey back to Bangkok (3 hours).Do yourself a favor and spend the full morning at Tiger Temple. Much more interaction with the Tigers. Also, assuming you are fit enough, take the bathing portion of the elephant experience. Playing in the water with them adds loads to the overall experience rather than just taking a ride. Thanks again Bo, Tong, and Bangkok Day Tours for an experience of a Lifetime. I will be back for sure."

Floating market was an eye opener with sights & smells new to us, saw an 11ft albino anaconda & dos some bartering for goods then back to our air conditioned can to head to tiger temple. The whole time we wee kept comfortable with drinks & snacks all free! Tiger temple was amazing, yes I am sure there are horrible ones in Thailand but this was not, the animals mainly roamed free apart from the older tigers which were on long chains, not drugged & very responsive, we got to fee a baby tiger & play with them in a pen which was fun. We then headed to the elephant farm by a large river, we ride them down & played in river, washed them etc. This was a truly amazing day, picked up at 7am & dropped off at 7pm long day but we will never forget it!"

There we had a lovely buffet lunch with a good choice of lovely Thai food. After lunch we travelled to go on to the highlight of the day, the Elephants, where we all rode bareback on one Elephant each. Firstly we rode down to the river where we got in with the Elephants and absolutely soaked each other. Then a trek around the grounds still on the Elephants back, but joined by my wife on the same Elephant.....a great memory that we will never forget.

It is advertised on the website as a group tour but when Joey turned up at our hotel it was just us on the trip. We had a lovely air conditioned minibus to ourselves with water and snacks provided for the journey. Joey did all the driving and he was very polite and accommodating. We drove up to the floating markets first which were about an hour and a half out of the city. It was still early in the day so nice and cool, we had our own little boat and spent about half an hour paddling around. The vendors are very pushy and there is no room for escape but a smile and a small shake of the head will usually deter them. For this part of the trip you must try the coconut pancakes cooked on one of the wooden boats floating around! The noodle spring rolls are also very tasty. The food is probably the best bit about this market, the rest is just the the usual tack. We then travelled up to the River Kwai which was another hour in the minibus. Along the way we picked up our guide Bo who spoke very good English and was extremely friendly. She answered all our history questions about the building of the bridge without any hesitation! This walk around was then followed by a thai buffet at a restaurant on the river - authentic and tasty. We rounded off the day with another hour and a half drive up to the elephant sanctuary. This was the best part of the day! We played with the elephants in the river and Bo took lots of photos on my camera for us. There was lots of driving involved but it was all worth it for the elephant experience. The operators even had a video made up and dropped off at our hotel a few days later - all included in the price!"

We did two tours with this company having read various trips people had done on Tripadvisor.The Bridge over Kwai ,Tiger Temple, and elephant trecking was one.Pick up was really early at 4.30 in the morning , but our driver and air conditioned 6 seater turned up perfectly on time . Lovely smiley chap who didnt speak much English but explained we were picking our guide up en route and assured us he did speak very good English.A packed breakfast was given to us and he showed us how to adjust the seats if we wanted to nap on the way.The transport was excellent.This trip was quite expensive at about \u00a3220 each but must say was worth every penny.We spent a little time at the bridge over the river Kwai, we got there really early because the day was crammed . Our guide was fantastic, he spoke English, not great English but we got by as he was only talking to us two not a large group.We had quite a laugh with both the guide and driver and found the whole experience very comfortable.Tiger Temple was amazing .We bottle fed the young tigers had a Thai breakfast in the temple which was very unusual. Some things were tasty some quite hot but was a perfect opportunity to try different foods.We played with the tigers, fed the tigers, walked with the tigers and watched them playing in the water.All the time our guide took both my camera and husbands mobile and took loads of photos and videos.Elephant trecking although a little scary, (we were bare back and very high up) was also a fabulous experience.My husband loved being ducked in the water by and elephant.A buffet lunch at a cafe/bar was provided and this was very good with plenty to eat.The other trip was just as fantastic. Same service , excellent guide, fab driver.This was to the floating market. grande palace and Wat Po .This was about \u00a3110 each again well worth it.My camera ran out of charge , the guide took us to a camera shop asked the camera shop to charge for a small fee while we all went for a coffee. If it hadnt been for her the photographs would never have happened. She was a fantastic and again took over the camera to get some fantastic shots.The lunch at a Thai restaurant was the best meal I had in Thailand.

I had the great privilege and pleasure to have Molly, a Bangkok Day Tours local guide for two different days while on vacation in January 2016. Molly was extremely knowledgeable of the Bangkok sightseeing sites and she genuinely cared about my welfare while in her care. Molly would closely listen to what was important to you and then tailor the day so that your wishes were accomplished. Molly has a wonderful and silly personality. She is also very talented with picture taking and she is more than happy to help you get some great angles and perspectives. I highly recommend Molly and Bangkok Day Tour for your sight seeing needs. So if you want an easy going, caring, and local tour guide who likes to joke around, Molly is your local tour guide."

This company is provides great service, is prompt with their replies and we loved our guide. It is a private tour so you have the entire comfortable vehicle to yourselves. At 4:30am our driver was waiting for us. He asked if we had a change of clothes and we assured him we did. Along the way we were provided with a substantial snack and then picked up our guide Na. She is one of the best guides we have ever had. Best yet, the photos she took of our trip were excellent.The first stop, as the sun was rising, was The Bridge Over the River Kwai. Na explained the historical significance, took some pictures of us and we continued on to the Tiger Temple.It was interesting to take part in putting food in the monks begging bowls. Both Na and a temple volunteer explained the proper etiquette to us. Na took our cameras and took lots of photos. While the monks went inside to pray we got to bottle feed the tiger cubs.Next was breakfast with the monks. We didn\u2019t actually eat with them but in the same building and off to the side. I chose not to eat and got to pet a deer that walked right up to me!It was the most amazing time. I held a cooked whole chicken and had a tiger eat from my hands. Then there was there was play time with tigers, shampooing the tigers and then a chance to walk them to the river. The tigers were very rambunctious at the river so we had to stay behind a fence for that part.One of the big tigers was trained to put his head in your lap. Only one person in the couple can have cats head in their lap but the other can pose. Again our guide took lots of great pictures.After leaving the Tiger Temple we were driven to the Elephant Camp. On the way we were provided with more snacks.When you ride the elephant you sit in a basket on their back. The mahout rides with you through the forest. After the ride you can change into clothes you will wear in the water. That was when we discovered we had forgotten our extra clothes and towels. No problem as there is a store there that sells inexpensive clothing and bathing suits. Bathing the elephants was one of the best, most fun experiences of my life and I am 65 years old (husband 69). Na took many pictures and videos on our cell phone and camera. She is quite the photographer. She was constantly yelling out instructions to the mahouts and to us. The river was very clean and I felt the mahout was careful to make sure we stayed safe. I still find it hard to believe I was sitting on the elephant\u2019s trunk getting sprayed with water. It was a lot of funny playing in the river. When it was time to leave there were very comfortable change rooms and places to rinse out your clothes. Na found us plastic bags for our wet clothes.There was a stop next for an included buffet lunch. Beer etc was extra but reasonably priced.We got back to Bangkok in the late afternoon tired but happy. This was a wonderful day and the highlight of our trip!"

Riding an elephant had always been on my bucket list-so imagine my excitement when I came across Bangkok Day Tours-not only could i ride an elephant but I could play in the water with one as well. Bangkok Day Tours was quick to respond to my emails and customized our tour as to what we wanted to do to give us the best possible experience. Because we were so far from the cruise ship port we had to spend the night-the tour company arranged for a lovely resort on the river Kwai. All meals were included and excellent. Molly our guide was fantastic, she was funny and knowledgeable and added little extra touches to our tour. The tiger temple was amazing however the experience at the elephant camp was phenomenal. A friend of ours that came along with us was skeptical at the beginning thinking were were going to ride around in a circle on an elephant. This however was not the case-we were given ample time in the water and on land with the elephants. He was pleasantly surprised by the experience-and admitted this was the best tour we did on our vacation. We were the only group of 4 there so we felt like we received extra special attention. On day 2 we went to the floating market and Grand Palace in Bangkok then had a delicious Thai lunch on the way back to the cruise ship. I cannot say enough about Bangkok Day Tours except that if you do not book with them it would be a big mistake."

My wife and I booked a day tour with Bangkok Day Tours to Bridge of the Kwai, Tiger Temple and Bathing and an Elephant experience. Joe, the best drive ever, (we mean that) picked us up promptly on time from our hotel in downtown Bangkok. I'm not one who loves long trips in the back seat of cars because of motion discomfort so I was a bit hesitant to book this trip in the first place because of all the driving. Let me state for the record that Joe's van was no ordinary van; it was the most comfortable and luxurious van I had ever been in! I would compare it to a luxury limo on the inside! Never once did I feel sick and there were many hours spent in the climate controlled, luxury van! A Joe was very friendly and understanding, he even made a custom video of our elephant experience, put it on a DVD and mailed it to us. It arrived 1 week later at our home in Maui! Nah, who was our tour guide who sat up front while Joe drove, took care of us from start to finish and could not have been more thoughtful and considerate. She greeted us with a huge smile from ear to ear and made us feel very welcome. Aside from being exceptionally knowledge about the history and animals of the places we visited, she doubles as your very own professional photographer!! She wheeled our iPhones, GoPro and Canon SLR like she had been using them for years and turned out some of the best photos my wife and I have of each other today! Really nice to be able to fully enjoy the moment not having to deal with cameras but still wind up with the shot that will surely be your next Facebook profile photo! The tiger and elephant experiences were on the up and up and professional. As animal lovers we had a keen eye for any mis-treatment or malnourishment of the animals. We were happy with what we saw and experienced. If you're thinking of a day tour outside the city of Bangkok and want to see Tigers and Elephants then this tour is a must and PLEASE ask for Joe and Nah!!! you'll be happy you did!"

First stop was the floating markets...hilarious but expensive..you can try and barter with them but they tend to stick to their prices...Onward then to bridge over the Kwai...lovely... Lunch is included and this is in floating restaurant at side of Kwai.Last stop is the elephant camp where first of all you have a bareback elephant ride around the camp.. Hold on tight! Then, if your brave, you ride the elephant down to the river and get squirted... Dunked and generally play with the elephants... Such a laugh. A lovely day out but a lot of time in car as big distances to cover. Worth it though."

The canal tour was very nice but beware of the amount of smog (coming from the engines of the long tailed boats) you will encounter in the canal, my boyfriend got a bit sick from the smog. The temples visited were breathtaking! Nuch made sure we got some amazing pictures throughout the tour, we felt as if we had hired a personal photographer. We definitely took special memories home.

It was great to engage with the tigers through feeding, walking, washing and playing. We would recommend visiting the tigers during the morning session (we had about 20 people, whereas the afternoon reportedly has in the hundreds). The elephant-riding was enjoyable, but we were unsure how well looked after the elephants were at the camp. It seemed a bit like a factory, and many of the elephants were obviously distressed by their chains and/or enclosures. A bit of a downer compared to the tigers.In all, we payed 18,000 baht. I do not think it was worth this much. Our recommendation would be just to do the tiger temple in the morning without a guide. It would likely be much cheaper, and avoid visiting the sad elephant enclosure."

I can't say enough good things about my experience with Bangkok Day Tours on the private, single day tour to Khao Yai National Park Tour. This trip was a last minute decision I made before leaving the States and I booked it for the day after my arrival in BKK. The entire booking process was efficient and secure and I appreciated that Bangkok Day Tours sent several emails confirming the booking and giving detailed information on what to pack and what to expect. My driver and guide picked me up at my hotel on time and during the ride up to the park, my guide went into great detail about the history of the park, conservation in Thailand, what flora and fauna to expect in the park, climatology, geography, Thai history and much more. She also ensured she pointed out things of interest along the way as well. Since it was a private tour, I had the opportunity to customize the trip to my interests and linger longer where I desired. We altered the set itinerary a bit since I had wanted to see waterfalls and due to the abnormally dry rainy season some of the falls were not as full as others. I appreciated her insights and guidance on this and the falls we saw were breathtaking. We also saw monkeys, deer, squirrels, and even saw an elephant on this trip! Seeing an elephant in the wild, by far, was the highlight of the trip. After our time in the park, we stopped for lunch outside the park and then I was returned to my hotel in the evening. It was a perfect way to see some of the beauty of Thailand without having a car or transportation of my own. I highly recommend the trip and this company! Enjoy! (note, it was also about 15 degrees cooler at the park than in BKK and in a forest so dress accordingly--bug spray, long pants etc)."

Seeing Monks and locals riding there boats and selling items was cool (can negotiate the best here). I wish I would have waited to buy stuff here because literally the cheapest. Then we headed towards the bridge/ lunch. The food was so good! it was buffet style and I came with an empty stomach. After about 45 minutes there we finally headed to the elephants. We first got on our elephants and walked around in the forest and camp site for 20 minutes (don't worry they take plenty of pictures for you). Then came the fun part. We got onto our elephants and went into the water! we had soooo much fun. The elephants would fill there trunks with water and splash us and we took a lot of pictures there also. Overall I would say this is well worth the money. My friends and I had a blast and a day full of adventure."

She helped get us a set at the first table, thoroughly explained what we were to do, and then took our phones/GoPro to capture the whole interaction. Next we went to the temple to feed the baby tigers and eat breakfast with the monks. She encouraged us to hurry along so we could be first in line at certain points and when to hang back at others so that we could have the best experience with the tigers. She again took our phones/GoPro and filmed/took pictures of the entire process. Bow could honestly be a professional photographer!

Just before it we arrived at the bridge we picked up Nga our tour guide for the day.

This meant we could just enjoy the day and know someone was grabbing photos of us without issue.On the minibus was water and light snacks. After the tiger temple we stopped for a buffet lunch. Soft drinks were an extra charge, but water tea and coffee was included with the food.

Yes, the tour can be a little on the costly side but it is soo worth it! We loved everything about it and the elephant riding was one of the best highlights of our trip! Do it!"

After this we were taken to the elephants where we got to ride them bareback as well as go into the water with them. We got back around 6 PM.Our tour guide Bow was amazing! Very nice, was able to answer all our questions, took some great pictures for us, and got us some discounts at the market. Highly recommend this !"

We are a family of four with kids aged 12 and 7.We were collected from our hotel 'bang on time' for the journey - and the driver pulled up to collect some goodies on the way. Very professional and courteous people (the driver and guide). We stopped for a brief visit to the Bridge were the guide was very knowledgable - kids wern't really interested and I realise I should have given them an insight before we went. Next stop the stunning 7 tier waterfall- where we swam with the 'sucking' fish and jumped from rocks - great fun. At the elephant ride we were given a choice whether to ride bareback or not (which we chose) and immediatley regretted as we didn't feel safe with the kids and the balancing. So we had seats put on and went for a ride. Fantastic scenary on such a majestic creature. Once back to the camp the seats were again removed for the elephant bath and it was amazing being 'dunked' and 'dunked' again. My little girl joined us again at the point and felt safer in the water. All the staff were brilliant with her and we take some fantastic memories back home of a brilliant day trip. Thanks to Na (guide) It wasn't the cheapest trip, but a quality one and very much recommended."

We had a great driver (Joe) he spoke enough English and then we picked up our tour guide (Tanya) an hour or so later. They had cold water and snacks waiting for us in the car and would stop anytime we needed to, bathroom, coffee, whatever. Stopped briefly at the Bridge of the River Kwai for a picture and then off to the elephant farm! Wow!! What an experience! They had a yummy breakfast for us wen we arrived. The mahouts were great with the elephants and driver and tour guide took tons of pictures and videos for us. They even had soap and shampoo for us to shower with after swimming (the only thing they didn't have and we didn't think of was a towel) but other than that they were prepared! Even had extra adapters so we could charge our cameras! Then we stopped for a nice Thai lunch and then off to the Tiger temple. Wow! Just a cool experience all around and wound up with TONS of great pictures! Highly recommended this tour and this tour company! Thanks for taking such great care of us!"

She waited in lobby for us.First to floating market. We were expecting a tourist trap but it was genuily nice. Get in a boat (no guide) and it rows to different market stands. Okay they do try to sell you stuff (its a market, what else should they do..) but its nice to bargain and look for some souvernirs.Next up bridge over Kwai. Very interesting. She took some pictures of us on my own cellphone. Excellent quality. We have lunch next to the river Kwai. It was buffet. Good food but drinks not included in price. Not too expensive.Last stop, elephant farm! You each get to ride elephant in the river and play with it. (sit on trunk,...) it was really nice!! After the river you get on 1 elephant (2 persons) and take a little walk bareback. Super! Sally took like 100 pictures of us.Negative points:Very very long car ride, expensive, drinks at lunch not included, official elephant picture not included in price (optional purchase, it should be included for this price).Positive points:Luxurious van, good guidance, good food, free water on the road, elephant trip = unforgettable."

I found this online after getting a very expensive quote from the hotel. It was easy to book and my voucher came a bit later. The driver was a 20 minutes late from the 6:15am pick-up time so I wish I had taken a bit more time to get breakfast! Otherwise, it's quite a bit of time in the car as you pick up other passengers for the tour and then you split into your different van. For the price I didn't really care... I should of brought a book though. And don't drink too much water! The van is comfortable. Then we were on our way! I took a paddle boat to get the view from the waterways of the markets. I wasn't really interested in buying tourist crap which my paddle boat driver worked out very quickly. I bought a coconut ice cream and was happy cruising/ taking photos so she drove me in a scenic way through. After that, I walked the market from the ground and then met up with the tour for the long-tail boat. Not much to see here but saves some of the driving time. Then it was back to Bangkok. My only suggestion is that for the first people picked up to be the first to be dropped off... we were in the car the longest! It was a nice way to spend the morning and love my photos."

We got picked up on the dot at 0700 from our hotel and had the luxury of our own minibus with reclining seats and amazing air on just for me and my friend. They provided us with snacks and water for the journey. Our first stop was at the floating market. We had about half an hour there and were not rushed at any point. Personally, I think half an hour was enough time. As you go in the morning, you miss the busiest time so it's much more chilled. From there, we went to the memorial bridge and went for lunch at an all you can eat Thai floating resteraunt on the river. Beautiful location. After some beautiful food we then went on the the elephant. BEST till last! We started by bathing them in the river and having so much fun with them and finishing with a small trek with them. I am massively against animal cruelty and was a little bit hesitant about seeing the elephants, but they genuinely seemed happy and well looked after. The only downfall about the day tour is the amour of time spent on the road. All the locations are atleast a 1-2 hour drive away from each other dependant on traffic, and then a 4 hour journey back to the hotel. But you're that tired from excitement that you just end up sleeping the journey. Be sure to go with Bangkok day tours and not day tours Bangkok! Hope your enjoy :)"

I am so impressed with this company, of all the tours I have been globally am extremely pleased with Bangkok Day Tours. First they pick up at 7am from the hotel you're staying at, and then take you to your first stop which is the Floating Market where you spend an hour. From there you proceed to your next stop about an 1-1.5 drive to Kwai River where you get to walk across the bridge where WWII happened, and get to have lunch buffet at the floating restaurant. You will not be disappointed by the choice of buffet they have prepared for you. After lunch a 30+ minute ride takes you to the Elephant camp, where you get to play and have an amazing experience. Our guide Sally was awesome, we gave her my phone and she takes all the pictures/videos for you as you play away with the elephants. After an hour you depart back for your hotel, ride back is 3-3.5 hours depending on traffic.Also there was no other tourists in the van they picked us up in so we got to enjoy, recline our seats and catch up on some zzzz's on the way back.It's money well spent with a great tour company and ask for Sally, she is sweet as pie. Thank you Bangkok Day Tours for such a great day without any hassle or fuss."

Transport was really comfortable and we had a car to ourselves, which was an unexpected bonus. Our tour guide, Na, was friendly, helpful and wanted us to have as many photos of the day as was humanly possible (over 700 in total, it turns out). The bridge over the river Kwai was beautiful, and a nice stop on the way to the temple. The temple itself was well run and playing with the baby tiger was incredible. We generally felt really safe but you need be aware that these are tigers (some of them absolutely huge) and you're not hidden from them behind a barrier or screen so there is a certain element of risk, if tigers scare you I do not recommend this tour.  The breakfast at the temple with the monks and volunteers was unexpectedly tasty and actually one of the culinary highlights of our whole trip.  The afternoon session with the elephants in the river was better than I had imagined it could be and is something we will remember for a very long time.You need to take good sun screen and a change of clothes, if possible I would also recommend some shoes that aren't flip flops as Flip flops, wet and slippery from washing tigers, makes it hard to move at speed away from the tigers, which is sometimes required.I would like to add that when we went on this trip I was concerned that there would be some level of cruelty evident, but that we never felt like the tigers and elephants we saw were being mistreated.I would recommend this trip to anyone not afraid of large and potentially lethal cats."

The tour started off with a pick up at our hotel, we were guided in a nice luxurious van with comfortable seating and cooling refreshments. I was pleasantly surprised to find that our tour was completey private. I personally think the tour guide makes or breaks your experience. And Bo definitely made this tour an amazing experience. She was friendly, informative, and all around, so sweet! We first went to the floating market where we sat in a boat and were rowed to different vendors and had the opportunity to buy little souvenirs. Bo then asked us if we needed to buy anything in particular because she knew the specific shop owners and could get us the best deals. We went to the river over the bridge next and had a nice buffet in the restaurant nearby. The buffet was absolutely beautiful and had all the delicious thai food you could ask for. The lunch was included in the tour except for drinks although I would've paid for it regardless. We then drove to the elephant camp and Bo informed us she would be taking pictures and videos for us. They give you an option of riding on a chair or going bareback. We chose to ride bareback to get the full experience and I did not regret it. We then got to go into the river to bathe the elephants. They also give you an option of sitting on the elephant's trunk while it dunks you in the water. I must have ended with over 300 pictures and 5 different videos of our experience that I will definitely be showing off to my friends. I'm so happy with this tour - they honestly make you feel like VIPs. For what you pay for, it is so well worth it. Thank you Bo and Ton, our driver for making this an unforgettable day! Ton, you are awesome! Drove us around for about 6-7 hours roundtrip with a smile! What a trooper. I will recommend this to anyone that comes to Bangkok!"

The buffet lunch included was very good, we had plenty of different dishes to choose from and the restaurant sits over the river. The journey from the river is about 1 hours drive to the elephant park. On arrival loose elephants was just walking around and munching, the elephant ride was enjoyable, slow and steady. Not like riding my horse. Fanta what a beautiful old lady. After a walk around the park we made our way down to the river.

So here goes, whatever come first.1. The best pricing for is amazing value2. Since our incredible experience was greatly influent by the staff, I must mention them by name: Joe, our driver, and Tanya, our tour Director3. We were picked up right on time, with the greatest smiles, and best, the greatest van, which can comfortably accommodate up to 9 travelers, thigh this vehicle, I believe was designed to take 16. The AC is strong, the music system is fabulous, the party interior is amazing if you have teenagers among your group. 4. Tanya has great personality, very friendly, helpful, and accommodating5. Joe is the safest driver, but he won't slow your trip even in constant heavy Bangkok traffic jams6. The Floating market experience was great. Prepare your camera and batteries and micro SD storage. Chances are you'll wish you have now7. The buffet luncheon at the Floating restaurant on by the Bridge over the Kwai River was INCREDIBLE in not only delicious authentic Thai food selection but also the friendly staff8. The Bridge over the Kwai River added a very historical sense to the whole itinerary. Our day was perfect weather-wise, allowed us to take some breathtaking pictures 9. The last activity, and definitely the most memorable activity capped of the best tour : elephant ride and bath at the famous Mahawangchang Elephant Camp. We had roughly 30 minutes riding the elephants (2 persons and the handler). We have done elephant rides probably 3 to 4 tones in various Asia destinations, but none was like this one: we sat directly to the elephant bare back, no secured bench, no rope to hang on to, and after 5 to 7 minutes, the handler dropped to the ground, walked in front with our phone, verbally commanded and took numerous pictures. We'd never thought this was actually happening. We got a huge kick from this. On the elephant bath, I'm afraid my words will do injustice to the incredibly fun experience that you'll have, so. ..you've gotta trust me, and take the tour to find our for yourself ;-)"

Did the 1508 three part tour, a real experience to remember, the tour is incredibly expensive but if you don\u2019t want to sit with other people in the bus it's worth it. We were collected promptly by our driver Joe in the smartest minivan I\u2019ve ever seen. We drove at break neck speed to our first stop and collect our guide called \u20188\u2019. Quick stop at the River Kwai which is a must to say you\u2019ve \u2018done it\u2019. Then a further speedy drive to see the elephants, it was somewhere along the motorway I thought our driver mad missed his calling In life and really should have been a fighter pilot. The elephants were amazing, the guide and driver thankfully took millions of pictures and the experience was something I'm unlikely ever to have to opportunity to repeat. This was my high point of a 3 week holiday, the elephants, in my opinion were \u2018happy\u2019 and I was quite apprehensive initially that I\u2019d take away a lasting sad memory but no. When we got off the elephants they were happy to sniffy you and be petted, I'm guessing if they were unhappy they wouldn\u2019t have been as animated and friendly as they were. Take a towel as you need a shower after the swim and they don\u2019t have any there.We left the elephants and headed to a restaurant for a buffet style lunch which was ok, nothing exciting.Then on to Tiger Temple. Personally I wouldn\u2019t recommend this the place struck me as a bit of a tip and I see it as a money making operation, unless I missed it I didn\u2019t see anything about where the money goes or any conservation projects. For your entrance fee you get to walk along with a tiger for 5 seconds and have your photo taken, then you can pay a hefty fee extra to have another photo taken. Whist I know it's hypocritical of me we also did the tiger cub feeding, on a plus point my girlfriend and I spend a good 10 minutes in a cage with 3 four month old tigers, that was an experience, if the tiger cub feeding hadn't been available as numbers are limited i'd say you'd be incredibly disappointed, but on the whole it left me with a bitter taste.Then back in the minivan and a 3 hour drive back to our hotel. River Kwai was good, Elephants were amazing, skip the tigers."

We were picked up from our hotel in an air-conditioned van with big reclining seats. Our driver was so friendly; he gave us bottled water as soon as we got in the van and again, along with a big bag of snacks, after we'd finished at the floating market. Later on in the day he stopped by the side of the road to get snacks which he let us try - they were deep fried sweet potato things and deep fried coconut bananas and absolutely delicious. The driver and the tour guide became like friends on the journey and we had a real laugh together. The market was really fun - you're pressured to buy at every turn and its hard to get the guy controlling the boat to move on but it was a good experience none the less. If you see the lady making coconut pancakes in the walkway to the dock definitely buy some - they're amazing! We also bought the best mango we've ever had from a fruit boat. We picked up our tour guide and went on to the Bridge over the River Kwai. He walked over the bridge with us, took photos and was really informative about its history. We then went for a buffet lunch at a restaurant overlooking the bridge - you could have as much as you wanted and it was all included in the price of the tour so pretty good value! The food was pretty good as well. The experience of riding the elephants and playing with them in the water was incredible, but it's the element of the day that would prevent me from wholeheartedly recommending this tour to others. The mahouts were friendly but I'm not sure their treatment of the elephants is very good. On the ride around the compound we saw an old elephant chained up in the distance, with no tusks and no eyes - they ignored us when we asked if he was okay. The water was full of elephant poo and there were flies everywhere - we spent the whole time stressing that we were going to get ill! The mahouts who accompanied us had sticks with little spikes on the end; I don't know if they were used (the elephants didn't look as if they had been maltreated) and as we were already there, the only thing we could do was make the most of it, but the whole experience left a bit of a sour taste in our mouths.I would recommend the company as the tour guides were great and made sure we had a really good experience, but I perhaps wouldn't recommend this tour in particular."

I don't know if it was the oppressive heat, or that we were touring on a Saturday, but it felt like she was doing the tour guide service as a tiresome routine, and therefore seemed lackluster and lacking in enthusiasm. There were several times that my husband and I attempted to ask questions about what she was talking to us about, but she deliberately ignored us and kept on talking as if delivering a well-rehearsed, mechanical spiel. Maybe it was because she wasn't that comfortable talking in English and therefore avoiding having to converse in English, but I still found it very rude... and definitely not consistent with the value (cost) of the private tour guide we paid for!"

A great all day event especially with kids 7 years up, this tour code provided by Bangkok Day Tours is excellent! Tour guide Na and Driver Jo are absolutely wonderful, and they made this day the highlight of our entire trip.  We were received by a cheerful Jo at 4;30 am at our hotel and then drove straight for about 2.5-3 hours till we got to our first stop - the bridge on the river Kwai. The bus is luxurious, flat-reclining seats, disco led lights on the ceiling (ha!) - the works. Very comfortable and we pretty much snoozed the whole way. Before we reached the bridge, we pick up Na - a local guide who has grown up in the area, loves its history and has a wealth of information on everything she is about to show you. She enters the bus with a bag load of snacks which my daughter is happy to see:) The bridge is a small stop, about 10 minutes. It is good to read up a bit about the history of this strategic bridge before you go as it enhances the experience. Took a few pictures (watch out for a small buzzing bee hive on the right side of the bridge!) and we were off for the main excursion of the day - the Tiger Temple.We arrive into the tiger temple around 7:45am. the first thing we do is feed the monks. Na has already brought the food with her, which we then open up and put in the monks bowls as they walk by us. If you have any food left at your station, you are to give it all to the last monk in the line, as they will only eat what is collectively put in their bowls. Extremely efficiently organized, respectful and in full silence, this was a great way to begin the day! Wear appropriate clothing, no tank tops or shorts for the ladies.We then enter the Tiger Temple. Na is familiar and knows practically everyone, cheerfully greeting everyone around. It may have been the reason we were picked first for nearly all the activities;) You go up the temple, and there are about 7-8 tiger cubs in different stages of growth all around you, surrounded by a multitude of volunteers, local and foreign. The cubs are extremely playful, you get to feed them and play games with them and its quite amazing to have a tiger cub in your lap! They are really frisky and the volunteers are constantly warning you to look behind and be wary as the cubs, although on long leashes, may attempt to playfully grab your leg or arm, not realizing their own strength. Don't wear long flowing skirts or wide leg pants - if any cloth flutters the cubs wanna grab it! The volunteers want no injuries to happen inadvertently, so continuous warnings are shouted out. The cubs fall sleep quite quickly too, kinda like puppies and kittens at home once they've finished eating...It is really adorable! Click as many pictures as you like, take videos etc. Soon it is time to walk them on leash to their home - they run, poop, fight and squabble on the way and quite a few of us hard a hard time keeping up with them. You then get to bathe a one year old tiger. They are really big and the whole activity is quite scary but surrounded by volunteers who constantly steered us around the tigers, we got through! (Meanwhile, the size of the tiger paw up-close is just freaky!)We then say bye to the cubs (I saw one hop on to the lap of a volunteer and nuzzle up - a sight i will probably never see anywhere but here!) and we get to the big boys! This is where the fear really sets in. You can smell the tiger, see it looking at you... no way do you want that flimsy rope leash to snap off! Even though we are assured by all that the tigers here do not see humans as \"food\", naturally, if a tiger does decide to jump, we got nothing;)You get to walk this majestic beast to a water body area in turns (never get in front of the tiger they keep reminding you). Its a lot easier than walking the cubs and you are NEVER going to get to do this anywhere else, so swallow the fear and grab the loose leash! (Also a good time to remember how low humans actually stand on the food chain, the god's-gift-to-earth chain and the beauty-of-nature chain)  We are then herded into a cage and the one/two-year old tigers are free in the water body. It is a magnificent sight! We get to see them jump, play, swim and spar with each other. It is absolutely breathtaking to see them this way. What hits you is the silence. They are so so quiet that many a times, one would sneak up near the cage and we wouldn't even notice! All in all - this visit made our trip. We do not believe in keeping wild animals in captivity. I did not know what to expect when i got there. I wanted my daughter to touch a tiger and this was the only place where i knew it could happen. I was completely taken aback with what I saw, the surroundings and the initmate tiger-human relationship. The place is serene & calm (you can hear monks chanting from time to time) and you have access to this incredible, beautiful beast at such close quarters - a real unique combination. When we asked about how they manage the tigers' well being, they told us that tigers being solitary animals are kept in isolated cages when they grow up, are well fed through the day, walked, watered, looked after (none of them were skinny or malnourished like we see in some zoos). We asked the 'are they ever drugged' question point blank to the supervisor and got this answer: No drugs, not de-clawed, exposed to human contact immediately after birth, all born and brought up at the temple itself, trained with a tap on the nose with a wooden stick if one went too far, no accidents (yet!) and a genuine love for these animals. Even though its a bit steep price wise, recommend this 4:30am version as by 11am, the tigers had been fed and were pretty drowsy. if you come in the afternoon, not sure if you get the same experience.The elephants at Kanchenaburi were fun too (going into the water with them is not for the faint-hearted or those with vertigo!) but hey...nothing beats having a baby tiger on your lap;) You get back to Bangkok by about 5pm - so its roughly a complete 12 hour day. Take your camera, wear walking shoes and appropriate clothing as you will meet monks. It will be a day to remember!"

Our tour guide was extremely friendly and gave us private time as needed. The time that we arrived at the River Kwai was perfect as there were no other tourists around. We were the only ones to cross the bridge and we were able to get pictures of the area without the presence of other people in the background. The tiger temple was an amazing experience and I enjoyed every moment of it. I left a separate review for the tiger temple at the Tiger Temple page as I felt like BDT had relatively little to do with that experience apart from securing us a spot in the morning tours and driving us to the temple. The lunch that was provided was actually quite enjoyable. It was buffet style at a floating restaurant on the River Kwai. There was a good variety of food available and there was a beautiful view of the bridge. The only reason I am giving BDT 4 stars is that I do believe that their prices were excessively high. $265 a person for the River Kwai + Morning Tiger Temple experience is a lot!However, it is definitely an experience I am glad I took part in because I am not sure when else I will spend a day in such close proximity to tigers from cubs to adults."

Our journey to the floating market, The Bridge over the River Kwai, lunch and Elephant Camp included stops at clean bathrooms and our guide provided everything we needed for our long day. Not only did Sally give us tons of information she was a great photographer too. She captured great photos and video footage of our 16 & 17 year olds laughter at the right times.When traveling in Bangkok we highly recommend booking an excursion with Bangkok Day Tours."

There aren't enough words to to say how happy we were with this tour. Our driver and guide picked us up from our hotel on time and we drove to the Bridge on the Kwai. Our guide gave us a good history on the bridge and took many pictures for us. Then, we went to the Tiger Temple where we first donate to the monks, then went into the tiger temples. We had so much fun playing with the baby tigers. Then we got to walk them and play with older tigers, too. Later we took a picture with a 5 year old tiger and we got to watch the big tigers play in the water and jump off a huge rock into the water. Throughout the entire experience, they took amazing photos of us. It was like having a travel photographer with us. Overall, it was a very fun experience.Then, we went to the elephant compound. First, we road on the back with a trainer. He made us a leaf and flower hat which was quite cute and a nice touch. He took photos with us on the elephant. Again, it was like a personal photographer. Then, the real fun began. We went swimming with the elephants. It was like an amusement park ride and one of the best experiences of the trip and possibly our lives. It was so wonderful. Our guide took pictures of us on there, too. This is also where going on the private tour is well worth it.  You can go on a tiger temple and elephant riding tour with a large group, but you won't get to swim with the elephants. This was the best experience of the trip and I REALLY recommend shelling out the extra money to do this. It was so much fun and I really can't say anything more positive about it.Also, wear bug repellant."

We ordered two separate tours with Bangkok Day Tours since my mom wanted to go to the palace and me and my son wanted to do the nature tour.They sent me a driver who spoke no English and finally picked up our guide after 2 hours driving in an unknown place with my 6 year old son. The guide was very young and didn't really do anything. We went to waterfalls and I became very unwell. The tour guide was helpful during this experience. At this time I had to rely on the driver and tour guide to protect my son and my personal belongings. When returning I was unable to find my phone and they informed me that when I was laid on the ground that many people were around and they think someone went into the van and took my phone. This doesn't seem reasonable as one of them should have been looking out for the van or locked it. Also my mom was sent a driver and tour guide that spoke minimal English and knew very little about the Temples/Palaces. My mom has traveled all over the world and was able read more than the tour guide was able to explain. Be careful when booking. They have lots of tour options but seems that they subcontract their work and don't consider the client during this process. Also they want full payment first thing when you get in the car! This was very sketchy and now after both of our experiences we see why because they didn't deserve what they charged us."

The ride on the elephant wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be. I had more fun with the bathing part of it. It was still a fun experience overall. It is a drive away from Bangkok - nearly 3 hours to the elephant camp.

The guide told us the protocol to follow with regard to giving the offerings.We then went to a special enclosure to feed milk via baby bottles to baby tigers. Once the babies were fed we played with them whilst the Monks chanted and prayed in the background. Once the Monks finished their morning devotions, we were invited to have a buffet breakfast with the Monks. The food was delicious, all Thai of course no continental After breakfast we washed the older tigers (teenagers) and hand fed them chicken. We then played with these tigers, they are exercised several times a day. Once the tigers were exercised we left that enclosure and went and walked yet bigger Tigers down to the canyon were there was a swimming hole. This was great the tigers and handlers were in the water, tigers were jumping for the toys. We also had our photo taken with the head of one very large tiger on our lap. This is a very special place, if you book for three or more people you also get to go to see the elephants which our family did. Lunch is at a beautiful Thai restaurant located alongside the bridge over the river Kwai. This is something special and like my family who recommended this to us, we would recommend to all."

            "review": "Incredible Company with an Outstanding Guide. 3 - Day Kachanaburi Tour - PrivateWe booked the three day tour out of Bangkok and we spent the extra money for the private experience due to my husbands health. We needed the flexibility and organization this company provided so we could ensure my hubby could rest when needed, start late if needed, or end our day early if needed.We got so much more than flexibility; we got the most amazing tour guide and crazy but very fun driver too.Pros:1- Our guide was truly amazing. Honestly, she made the Tiger Temple experience so much better than other guests experienced. She immediately guided us and created opportunities to connect with almost every baby and young tiger present. She dynamically showed us how to connect and then went around the temple seeking out new experiences for us. We reflected on how other people in larger tours basically observed the Tigers from a distance as our guide placed us perfectly for a special interaction. I wound up with a baby in my lap sleeping after being bottle fed. I skipped the meal to have more time with the babies because of her diligence and creative approaches to making things happen. I even had another guest lean over and say the obvious: \"Your guide is so fantastic. My guide is talking with her friends while yours is running all over the temple. How did you find her?\"Guides Name: Sally (not sure of her Thai name but this is how she liked being addressed.)2 - The activities were exceptional except for one which I will address later in the cons section. Salty carried such a reverence and respect when crossing the river Kwai with us that we couldn't help but feel more deeply the gravity and emotion connected to the history of the railroad. Her ability to not only share her knowledge but also highlight the cultural impact on Thai people moved us very deeply. 3 - Erawan N.P. - Not to be a broken record but once again, Sally made a stunning hike up seven tiers of a waterfall even better by telling us how to do the natural water slide and taking pictures of us as we enjoyed each moment. 4- Caroline from the main office who handled our booking and the hotel issues that ensued was incredible. She was the model of professionalism and made our concerns feel heard and valued regarding the hotel. She has been a delight from the very beginning. We would never work with someone else when booking tours in Bangkok. Cons1- The Elephant Walk to the River - After visiting Patara in Chiang Mai, you recognize there are good and not so good ways to create experiences connecting with the elephants. Patara Elephant Farm in Chiang Mai was amazing and did this so well with the elephants well being at the forefront of every interaction.However, the 2 1/2 hour included elephant interaction in Kanchanaburi with this 3-day tour should be reconsidered and possibly offered to a better company. I enjoyed the walk to the river and playing in the water, but I was concerned after observing how they treat the elephants. A young baby elephant (still on milk bottles) had a chain attached to his leg and he was in a very small pen. He paced back and forth and was clearly in mental distress. After visiting the other elephant farm in Chiang Mai a week later, they expressed that elephants should be with their family units for life. We observed babies crying for their mothers in Chiang Mai and watched the mothers run to them. The baby elephant in Kanchanaburi was alone in a pen with a chain on his foot separated from his mother when he was brought to this farm. When I asked about this at this farm in Kanchanaburi, I was told the baby has to be separated from the mother for training purposes. This situation was heartbreaking, and the great pics simply remind me of the baby attached to a chain in a small pen. I am not an elephant expert so I can only report what we observed and then heard when we asked questions. You will need to decide what is right for you. This did not feel right to us. If we all request to have an experience with a farm where families are still intact, I bet these types of elephant farms will be forced to change how they do business. You as a tourist will need to use your conscience to decide what is right for you and your family. Not everyone will agree with my perception about the treatment of the baby elephant, and I accept that. I challenge you to ask your own questions and do your best to ensure the animals you interact with in any country are cared for in a fashion that reflects current research-based practices and a strict adherence to respect and compassion. This was something I want to do better in the future and take more responsibility regarding these issues. I hope you will join me. 2- Hotel Room Issue - The Royal River Kwai Resort was a decent resort, and with Sally's incredible help, the evening meals she helped us order were good. That said, we tried to change our room, and the hotel told our company they had no more regular rooms. We had paid an upgrade price for a room with a tub so my husband could take a bath which helps his severe headaches he gets from a congenital brain issue. The bathtub was very, very, very tiny, or maybe, we're just too big. I'm 5'10 and weigh 187 lbs, and my legs would only fit in this soaking tub. LOL! Regardless, the tub wouldn't work, but the hotel refused to change the room because they didn't want to part with the upgrade fee (3,000 baht). It was a hefty fee but we did not receive the intended benefit. This was strictly meant to support my husbands well being. Caroline and Sally saved the day and made this somewhat right, but the hotel could have just changed our room. I don't believe the situation required so much time and effort. The hotel was almost empty so they looked rather dishonest when they claimed to have no rooms. When they did switch us, they claimed to only have a room with two twin beds, which seemed more of a punishment. It seemed petty and ridiculous to us over an upgrade fee. We recommend you consider when booking to ask for a different hotel for this and other reasons. There are many great options in the area. We are still shocked they did not return the entire fee. Caroline handled this incredibly well and did the best she could to make this right. Again, she made us feel like she was on our side and demonstrated this by speaking to the hotel manager for us. In the end, we never got the full fee returned and we spent the other nights in a separate bed. Our list of pros could fill the Internet about this company and our personalized experience. Bangkok Day Tours was an incredible route to create fantastic memories that were worry free! Sally is a truly professional, highly intelligent, and wonderful guide! If you are lucky enough to get her, you are assured a great experience no matter the itinerary. Lastly, it would help tremendously if the company provided some guidance on tipping. The article I read said ten to twenty dollars per day, and we tipped $60 for our three days. However, it simply did not feel like enough for us. We wished we knew the right parameters in which to work, because Sally was top notch in every way! The company should direct tourists in this affair, or their hard workers may not be honored properly for all they do. We were giving the very top of what we believed to be the tipping range, but we still aren't sure. Safe travels to all of you! You cannot go wrong with this company. We will never forget our time with them and hope Caroline and Sally know how grateful we are."

On the way out there we hit the bridge over the river Kwai and the floating market. However, on the way back we didn't make any stops. The actually elephant riding was great, there was a swimming portion and a riding portion. Ask for Molly, best guide!"

Trip (Code:LC2111) with Bangkok Day Tours - sensational.Yes, it was a very long drive from the cruise port ....... and would I do it again? Undoubtedly!!! In a heartbeat!! The tour surpassed the long drive and Molly, our guide, was the perfect guide - a little bit of sharing and a bit of quiet time. She was awesome - her sense of humour was cheeky, the snacks she had on the bus for us - yummy! and the air-conditioned 9-seater was very comfortable. The Tiger Temple was absolutely sensational. What a privilege to be able to view and touch these mighty animals. Our group was lucky enough to visit fairly late in the day so after the crowds had gone we we able to watch these amazing creatures jump, play and swim and have lots of fun and exercise in their pond.One tiger was enjoying himself so much he resisted following the others when they left the water. He had to be encouraged out and then when the trainers weren't looking......there he was back in the water again! We were only a wire fence away (only mid height and very much like a toddler's play pen) from these big cats as we watched them frolicking. Was I crazy???? Oddly it seemed very safe at the time and I didn't even consider it being anything else. Would I do it again? Yup!We also had our swim with the elephants. Loved this activity! My elephant kept dunking me! Our group enjoyed this as much as it seemed the elephants did. Molly was great in that she took lots of photos while we were playing.We were able to walk over the Bridge at the River Kwai. Memorable and lots of great photo spots.Such a great tour and the Company was a delight to deal with from my very first email. They always answered promptly and were just lovely. I really recommend this company and tour."

My husband & I wanted to treat our daughter, son in law and 3 grandchildren to a day trip where we could see River Kwai, Floating markets for us and tiger cub feeding for the 3 girls aged 5, 9 & 11. The Bangkok Day tour company, especially Caroline, were fantastic & responded to my emails before we arrived in Bangkok as well as when we confirmed once we arrived. We did a private tour for 5 in a beautifully airconditioned mini bus driven by Joe & were picked up promptly at 7am. Sally was our guide and she was informative and lovely explaining everything on the way. Our organised lunch at River Kwai was delicious, floating markets was very interesting. However, I was appalled at the state of the Tiger Temple and wished I had done more research on this place. The adult tigers looked drugged & so bored just sitting for ages while everyone got their photo taken with them. The handlers pulled them around like \"puppets\" to get photos. The cubs were very cute and we spend 45mins with them where the children could feed them and play with them. However, they were only 2 weeks old and I couldn't understand why they were taken from their mothers so early because I thought if they were returned to their mothers they would be rejected because they would smell of humans. When I asked a keeper this she just avoided answering. Where were the mothers? I now believe they are taken away just to sustain the tourism industry. Please don't go to this so called \"tiger temple\" but use this tour company because they can't be faulted."

There were two Celebrity ships in Laem Chabang port that day and our guide and driver were waiting at the wrong ship. This minor issue was soon sorted out and we were on our way. Our guide \"just call me green\" and our driver were fabulous, we were really well looked after on our tour especially by our guide. It is a long drive (over 4 hours with comfort stops) to the tiger temple near Kanchanaburi. I honestly don't know how I feel about this place as the tigers looked drugged. We were told this is not so and that they were sleeping in the sun after being exercised and fed. The ride on the elephants was fantastic and feeding the baby elephant was the icing on the cake. Our hotel in Kanchanaburi, Royal River Kwai, was lovely and quiet, clean and the food very good. Early next morning we were taken to the Bridge on the River Kwai and as it was early we more or less had the bridge to ourselves. We then had a 10 minute stop at the war cemetery, If you take this tour and you are either Australian or British please make a short visit to this very emotional and well maintained cemetery.It was then on to Bangkok where we were given a lovely buffet lunch on a floating restaurant before a visit to the Grand Palace and Wat Pho reclining buddha.All in all I can safely say if you want a great tour from your cruise ship at less than half the ships tour price, then I can highly recommend Bangkok Day Tours.Thank you \"green\" for taking such good care of us."

Picked up early by our driver adnan and we had the luxury minibus to ourselves (having seen the minibuses other companies use you want to go with Bangkok day tours) it was very easy to relax in the reclining seats and drift away as the scenery whips by, Adnan does not like to hang around! We stopped at several locations along the way to see some interesting sights (the salt flats with locals recovering the sea salt were really interesting). Then you get to the floating market where we were given as much time as we needed to travel round the market as we needed. Yes it is a very tourist aimed market but it is one of the things you think of when you think of Thailand and well worth a visit, really glad we did it. And best of all you get to see it before it becomes chaotic later in the day! Then off to the bridge over the river Kwai, collecting our guide Bow on route. Again a wonderful visit with Bow very knowledgable and willing to answer all questions. Nice to see some people still respect the sacrifice our troops made during the war, not always the case back home! Here we also had lunch at the floating restaurant where the food is lovely and you have a stunning view of the bridge. Then finally we made our way to the elephants and had a wonderful couple of hours being thrown about in the river by them. This really is an experience worth the money. The elephants are very well looked after and really enjoy themselves playing with the guests. Bow took loads of photos and even when our camera was full she was happy to use her phone and send the photos by Facebook back to us which we are very grateful for. Then finally the long drive back to Bangkok but again Adnan is no slouch and has back in under three hours while we dosed in the back of the van! Our thanks to both Adnan and Bow for a truly wonderful day. Something I would advise anyone travelling to Thailand to do."

It was a long day (more than 12 hours) and I didn't really feel that we needed a guide, but she definitely was helpful and knowledgeable, especially at the elephant camp where she took a million photos and negotiated our activities. The floating market was really amazing- it is definitely for tourists, but we didn't mind. It was about 1.5 hours from BKK. We rode in the boat for about 30 min and bought some souvenirs. Na had told us the prices beforehand and showed us that prices were lower on land. We then drove maybe another 1.5 hours to the bridge. We arrived at midday and it was extremely hot. There isn't much historical info on site. We loved the buffet lunch looking up at the bridge. We then drove maybe another 1.5-2 hours to the elephant camp. We first rode 2 people per elephant around the camp and then changed into bathing suits to go into the river. At this point, we were bareback on the elephants with an elephant and guide for each person. It was a little nervewracking! Once we got used to it, though, it was amazing! The elephants sprayed us and played for a while in the water. It took 3-4 hours to return to BKK. We were very pleased with the company - they were very responsive by email and quite attentive during the tour. Joe was a safe and careful driver. I was able to install the kids' carseats and we all had working seatbelts. The van was large and roomy and on our return we watched a movie (no kids movies though). Overall, it was an expensive tour, but we believe it was worth it, as it covered 12+ hours, many miles, and a once in a lifetime experience with the elephants."

It allowed us to visit a variety of properties along the canal such as an orchid farm, a fruit orchard, a community that produces rice-based chips and a lotus farm. The private tour itself was a great experience! Our very knowledgeable guide helped us understand Thai culture more and this tour gave us a glimpse of the rural life in Thailand. She even had an assistant who had a camera to document the trip for us by taking photos and a video. Bangkok Day Tours later provided us a CD containing our photos and video. What came as a surprise was the unauthorized uploading of our video in Bangkok Day Tour's You Tube channel. After we complained to Bangkok Day Tours, they apologized and immediately took it down. So, unless you want to be part of the company's marketing campaign, I suggest you inform the company in writing that you want to maintain your privacy and will not allow them to use your photos or video for their company's tour promotions."

Bo is very kind and knowledgable. She took a lot of photos for our family the whole day! We had a lovely buffet style lunch, included in the price of the tour- but the drinks will cost you money, even water so come prepared. At the elephant ride, we bathed the elephants first and Bo took our camera and took a lot of great pics. She was sure to get good angles and asked the elephant handlers to stop or move to ensure a good picture. I don't swim well, and asked the handler not to have me dunked, but my family was swimming in the river with them. Beware you will be completely wet and swimming is involved unless you state otherwise. Bring a change of clothes as well. A waterproof camera would also be great to take pictures up close but again, Bo did amazing! The handlers were great, we had fun with them.On the way home, Bo had snacks for us, cold wash clothes and cold water waiting. It was a very amazing and unforgettable experience. Well worth the money! Take- extra clothes, extra money to tip the handlers. We also tipped Bo and Andook who spent the whole day with us and were so great. Waterproof camera or go pro if you have one. Also, beware it is a long day and drive from Bangkok to the elephant camp...about 3-4 hours. It is broken up nicely with the market, bridge and lunch. The ride home is long though but we enjoyed the drive as it is a nice way to see the country. Thank you for the great day!"

The dinner was a lovely buffet over looking the bridge where we met our very informative guide who explained a lot of history to usThe floating market is something to be seen and admired as it is such a odd thing to experience The elephant tour was also amazing and me and my girlfriend played with the elephants in the water, we understood how gentle they were and our guide would arrange photo ops for us which helped create lasting memoriesThe whole day was amazing and we felt that we were truly looked after by the company, this is one thing to do in Thailand I never usually post reviews but I believed that this day deserved a outstanding one 10/10"

Our lovely driver, Adul, and sweet tour guide, Bow, were promptly waiting for us in a roomy air conditioned van. An hour and a half later we arrived at the floating markets where a half an hour canoe ride was included. We then had time to walk around at our leisure (we ended up getting a photo with a massive python). The bridge over the river Kwai was next which was definitely a sight to see but lots of tourists! Had a nice buffet lunch right on the river which was also included - but not drinks. Going to see the elephants was the best part of the day! As soon as we got there we went on to our elephants bareback (with a guide too) and straight into the river! The elephants were amazing. Spraying water at us, flinging us into the water - it was awesome. Bow is an amazing photographer so thanks to her we have great photos to remember our fun experience by :) Adul is an excellent driver and we felt very safe with him driving while we had a nap on the way home! He is also hilarious! I could not recommend Bow and Adul more highly. They were so friendly, warm and approachable and even though our day was fun from the activities, they made it so much better."

Then we had lunch at a Thai restaurant by the river - very good Thai food. Then we went on a long boat on the river and canal. There only was our party on the tour so a private tour really, which meant we went at our own pace and our tour guide personalised it - he learned my son liked the tuk tuks so we had a tuk tuk ride added in.The our was quite pricey I thought but it was ideal for us to see these sights."

            "review": "Best day ever - def not to be missed. Such an amazing experience! Great itinerary, super friendly and knowledgeable staff, and just overall an unforgettable journey. Our guide Bow and driver Adul (maybe Arun? apologies, I didn't hear the spelling very clearly) were there at 4:25 for our 4:30 pick-up and the day was off to a great albeit early start. After passing out for 90 minutes we stopped for a bathroom and coffee break before heading over to the River Kwai. Quaint place it is during that time of day. Bow and Adul even bought us water and snacks, even though we were getting breakfast at the elephant camp later. Which was, of course, a splendid experience. While we were waiting for breakfast to be cooked, we stopped by to see the elephant show. I was immediately called up to join the show and proceeded to get a nice elephant massage plus a big, wet, elephant smooch. Then off to a delicious breakfast, followed by the land portion of the elephant experience. After banana time for the 2 gals, we went down to the river for some more fun. Pro tip: wear heavy-duty pants -- it may sound odd given it's hot and you're going into the water, but do this or face the wrath of spiky elephant hairs. It's been 20+ days and my leg is still recovering from those stings.Lunch was at a pre-set place with a pre-set (but included) buffet. Nothing special, but not bad either. Definitely for tourists. Then it was off to the Tiger Temple, where our highlight was playing and feeding with the 1mo and 3mo tiger cubs. Such cuties, some who were very sleepy, some who were very playful. This, though, was also the one part of the package that was not included nor well-explained. Bangkok Day Tours will charge you 1500 baht pp for the cub feeding, while it's 1000 baht pp at the Tiger Temple. They charge this commission b/c apparently the sessions get filled up quickly...though when we arrived we definitely still saw people getting tix for our session. But overall, amazing trip. After the tigers we passed out again and then were promptly dropped off back at our hotel. Definitely would recommend!"

            "review": "Best thing we did was booking this tour!. Booked a 3 day tour in November 2014 with Bangkok day tours. Sally picked us up from our hotel in Bangkok with our driver Mr T. Over the course of the next 3 days we would enjoy experiences that are truly unforgettable.Day 1 we visited the elephants. We got to bottle feed a baby elephant and also take time to feed some of the adult elephants. We then rode on 2 elephants down to the river were we played with the elephants in the water, after they brought us back to the main building we got to feed them bananas (take money with you so you can do this (1 bunch is 50 baht) you can also tip the mahouts) when you ride the elephants at this stage you just ride on their back with only the mahout, however later on you ride on another elephant around the site in a seat on their back ( husband and I together)Day 2 we were supposed to visit the Tigers but instead went to the Erawan national park to trek up the waterfalls. Sally decided this last minute but glad she did as when we went to the waterfalls we had them all to ourselves! You have to get up very early on this tour (leaving 6:30am each day) but it is worth it as you get a much more personal experience at each activity, by the time we had done our trek the waterfalls were very busy as lots of other families and tourists are there throughout the day. I didn't realise how much I would enjoy this day, there are 7 waterfalls in total to trek upto so it is quite hard going as you get further to the top, I made sure I went in each of the waterfalls just be prepared for the fish nibbling your feet! It tickles!Day 3 we visited the tiger temple, there was only about 20 people on the tour so again you had a really personal experience handling tigers one on one. We held tiger cubs who were 5 weeks old then spent time doing activities with older ones (5-8 months) then we went into a canyon where we had our picture taken with a fully grown tiger and then watched them (6 adult tigers) play in the water together. It was a fantastic experience, reading previous reviews we booked this tour so we could go in the morning when the Tigers are more alert, in the afternoon when the majority of people come it is very hot and cats naturally sleep at this time, in the morning we could see them playing and interacting with each other. When we have got home people have asked us whether the Tigers are drugged particularly when we show them our picture with the adult. I honestly don't believe this is the case as minutes later he is running and jumping in the water, not at all tired!We were told that the purpose of the temple is to raise funds to build a reserve where the Tigers can live, Josh one of the staff said that this is not an ideal scenario for the Tigers but in the wild they are at risk of poaching, we hope that the work that they are doing at the temple can help save Tigers.We also went to the floating market and to the death railway, war cemetery and bridge over the river Kwai. We enjoyed the floating market but felt the historical sites to be sad, we are glad that Sally took us to see these places so we could learn about the history of these events and appreciate what the Thai people went through at this time.I finally just wanted to add about our accommodation and food while we were on the tour, the hotel was the Royal River Kwai resort which was lovely, beautiful gardens and surroundings, the room was clean, only issue is my husband and I are both 6ft and the shower is not adjustable so I had to kneel down in the bath to wash my hair! The food was excellent, the staff could not do enough for us, my husband is vegetarian and both the staff and Sally worked together to ensure he was also catered for.Thank you again to Sally for such a fantastic trip, we have and will continue to recommend you to others!"

This attraction was one of our last activities during our Honeymoon trip to Asia (December 2014) and in our view was an extraordinary lifetime experience. We booked with Bangkok Days Tours, a very serious firm with an incredible service from our tour guide Sally. Any trip to Thailand should include this activity.Tiger\u2019s temple was awesome. The incredible experience of interacting with tigers with all ages (from 2-week born to 5-year old) makes the whole trip worth waking up at 4:00am.Sally was clever enough as to provide us with breakfast during the road in order to have more time and play with the cubs.The elephant ride was something really special too. Riding elephants and playing with them in the river is a lifetime experience.The only point of improvement is the lunch provided at a very simple restaurant with limited food options. Nevertheless, despite this the whole experience and service deserves 5 stars without a doubt!"

The tiger tour was amazing, the bridge again in the morning but at a different light so gave a different affect.. Arrived at the tigers and was excited to play with the babies straight away to get you used to them, was calm the whole tour and the tiger seemed to be really cared for. Lunch and snacks were provided both day and bus/4wd was comfortable. Would definitely do again when in Bangkok."

We booked to go to the floating market, the bridge over the river Kwai and the tiger temple - there were 3 in our party; a teenager (hates everything), her dad (who hates tours & anything cultural) and Mum who loves history and visiting new places! Something for everyone right? We had an Early start 7am, so already the moans and groans set in but we got up and we were met by joe our driver, he told us no-one else had booked so it was just us & our 1st stop was the floating market 1.5 hours drive from our hotel in Bangkok (que moans & groans). The mini bus was fab, equipped with drinks, mini cinema and disco lights! Joe gave us some information en-route but we just slept mostly. 1st stop the floating market - didn't buy much as the prices are inflated & it's just tourist tat but it was great fun, try the coconut pancakes - yummy! Next stop 30 minutes away - lunch at the River Kwai, great thai style buffet - food was exceptional and the view to die for; here we met Na our guide for the River and the Tiger Temple, she said let's come back to the River & do the temple earlier than two as you 'll get longer time with the Tigers and she was right! All through our time there she was pushing us along to get the best pics and slots with the tigers and I can honestly say she made the whole trip for us - I have done a lot of tours all over the world and this far exceeds any I have done up to now and I am sure it was because we had Na there to show us the ropes. Also, the cub feeding was A-mazing. After this we headed back to the River which was beautiful and again Na was full of information and information. The drive back to a Bangkok was 3 hours (ouch) but we put a film on, the seats back and chilled. I know it's been a good day when I don't hear any moans or groans from.my family and especially when there is a huge smile on my teenage daughters face after a full day and a 3 hour drive home!! I highly recommend this trip but most of all I highly recommend our driver Joe and our tour guide Na."

            "review": "The highlight of our stay in Thailand. I was actually hesitant in booking with any tour companies at first, but I saw excellent reviews for Bangkok Day Tours and thought it could be worth the risk. And guess what? The risk yielded fantastic results! The guide, Bo, and their collections officer were already waiting for us at the lobby even before our committed time, 7am . (Like I said, I was hesitant so I only paid for a quarter of the entire amount online and paid them in full before we started the tour.) We didn't even have to call them for confirmation the day before. So I had one less thing to worry about. We started the tour shopping at the floating market. We had quite a haul. Be sure to haggle a lot though. Since we're also from Asia, we had a pretty good idea how much we can haggle these things for. If you don't have an idea, you can start haggling from 75% off and work your way from there. After shopping, we went to the railroad bridge over River Kwai. And had a good meal on a floating buffet restaurant (included on our tour cost). After lunch, we headed straight for our elephant ride. Our first activity with the elephants was bathing in River Kwai. It was the most fun of the entire experience. We rode their backs on the way to the river and made our way back to the camp after bathing. We fed them bananas as tip. Then, we went on another elephant ride (now with seats and they're different elephants) around the camp. Then again, we fed them as tip. :) We changed into our dry clothes and went back to the hotel. The camp is about 3-4 hours from the city center."

What we got was so much more -- seriously, probably the best single vacation day we have ever had! Well worth the cost. We were picked up at our hotel at 4:30 a.m. and didn't return until about 7 p.m. We were driven in a private van to the Tiger Temple and after giving the monks an early morning breakfast (provided by the tour company), we spent a half day playing with tiger cubs and interacting with the large tigers too. I never expected to be able to see these beautiful animals this close -- let alone hold and feed the little cubs! The monks and volunteers at the temple are doing an amazing job with these rescued animals. We have many photos our terrific guide, Na, took as memories and to show our friends just how unique it was! Then, we drove to an elephant camp and had another incredible experience. My husband and I each got onto an elephant and rode into the river for a little water fun. Each of us had a young Thai elephant guide on the back of our elephant for part of the time (who was making sure all was OK), but we were \"bareback\" on the elephants, without a saddle of any kind, and just enjoying playing with them in the water. It was pure joy for us animal lovers. I realized later that the river water probably was not great to swim in with them, but they did provide a shower afterward and we had no ill effects. The whole day was magical. I highly recommend this company and this particular tour. You won't be sorry!"

Sally our guide was courteous and friendly, our private minivan was extremely comfortable and water and a packed breakfast was provided. We arrived early at the River Kwai at around 6.00am when the early morning mist was still on the river and it was magical. Only 2 other people were there so we could look around and experience the place in near solitude.We then went on to the Tiger Temple, bad reviews abound about this place which made me wonder whether to book this trip. All I can say about that is - spend the extra money and go on the morning tour when you can see the place properly and experience the Tigers from feeding the babies and youngsters up to 4 months, walking the 4 month old tiger, bathing and feeding the 1 year olds followed by playing with them in their enclosure- scary but we were well looked after. We then walked the big guys to the river, photo op with head in lap and watched the Tigers playing in the pool. The guides at the temple are pleasant and professional. You may not agree with tigers in captivity however anything that can be done to highlight these magnificent animals can't be all bad.After the temple we went for a delicious buffet lunch then it was on to the elephant camp for an enjoyable ride on the elephants with my husband acting as a mahout for some of the time.We can't fault our day it was brilliant and I would recommend Bangkok Day Tours unreservedly for their professional and friendly service."

I have never been inclined to write a review, until I met Na from Bangkok Day tours. We selected to do the Tiger Temple and Elephant bathing tour. The driver was prompt and we were given our own vehicle. When our tour guide, Na got into the van an hour later I was confident this was going to be a great day. Her pleasant demeanor and friendly attitude was immediately contagious. We stopped briefly at River Kwai Bridge for photos. We did not even ask and Na was telling us how to pose and snapping pictures with every device capable! The bridge over sunset photos came out PHENOMENAL! When we got back into the van, we saw Na and the driver bought a light snack for us which was so thoughtful! Listen, I have had my fair share of great tours but the human factor and the thoughtfulness was truly touching. When we got to the Tiger Temple, Na was always scurrying ahead to make sure we got the best views, the best tiger etc. She snapped over 1000 photos for us. When she was not allowed in certain parts of the program, we later realized she convinced workers to snap up close and personal pictures of the adult lions- about an inch away from their face. This just says about the professionalism and thoughtfulness of this amazing person. Instead of sitting around or chatting with other tour guides, she was running around in the heat and taking pictures we did not even know about just so we can enjoy later. This was the best money I ever spent. I regret not using them for my other 3 tours in Bangkok. Thank you Na and Bangkok Day tours!"

So wrapped she captured every moment on camera for us!Between the tiger temple and elephant bathing they had more snacks, cold water and refreshing towels for us.Once we played with the elephants we were quite dirty from the lake water. Our tour guide pulled out shower gel from the back of the van and showed us where the showers were. After that we were taken to a lovely restaurant where it was buffet style and the food was delicious and fresh.On our long trip home we were able to watch a movie in the van, view our photos from the day and have another napAll in all I could not fault this company and wouldn't hesitate to book with them again"

Our guide made sure we were at the front of the queue and helped us to get some awesome photos of the tigers. We had also chosen to feed the baby tigers which was just magical! I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Bangkok although if you have never been to Bangkok this is a long way out of the city and a full day tour, and there are other things to see in Bangkok like floating market, wat pho, grand palace etc if its your first visit. This wasn't for us thats why we chose to do this trip and it was definately worth it! I also have to mention our driver, he was fantastic.....driving in Bangkok is a bit hair raising but he did a fantastic job and we felt completely safe throughout the 4-5 hours of driving on this tour. All costs were included in the tour so we had nothing else to pay out on the day."

But our girls were not big enough to bathe the larger elephants Our wonderful guide Bow, made arrangements for our children to bathe a 1 year old elephant which was so cute! She watched our girls and took pictures of my husband and I in the river with the elephants. Our guide was friendly, helpful, knowledgable as well as the driver. I would highly recommend this tour."

Our guide Na was fantastic, full of interesting information and unbelievably enthusiastic and helpful.We did the floating market,river Kwai and elephant camp trip and the whole family had the best day ever. Yes, the floating market is touristy as is the river Kwai but they were still great if you've never been.As for the elephants, an absolutely unbeleiveable experience and something all of us, especially the kids (teenagers) will remember their whole lives. Na took a load of photos and videos on our phones while we were bathing and playing with the elephants in the river. Whatever words I write won't do justice the the amount of enjoyment we all had from this activity.If you get the chance just do it. It's a very professional company and you will have a day you'll never forget."

The tiger temple was an amazing experience: we got to play with and feed baby tigers, to wash and shampoo older ones and to walk and observe the very large ones--up close and intimate. The elephant camp was great too--completely as advertised. We each got to ride our own elephant, sitting behind its head, with a mahout behind us. We rode them into the river and the mahouts got off, and we got to spend a lot of time playing with and riding on and swimming with these wonderful creatures. The van was ultra-luxury and the driver and guide were great. The trip included lunch and a restaurant. The guide took our cameras and took non-stop pictures while we interacted with the tigers and elephants. This was a day neither of us will ever forget!!"

            "review": "Excellent 2 day tour of Thailand. My family of 4 booked the 2 day trip to the elephant ride in Kanchaburi, the bridge over the river Kwai, and the Floating market. Our tour guide and driver picked us up from our cruise ship in Laem Chabang on time and we were very happy with the ability to speak English by our guide, Tanya.We boarded a lovely air conditioned van on our way to Kanchaburi. We made a quick stop in Bangkok, to pay for our tour, and load up on snacks for the trip. The owner was very accomodating and nice. I enjoyed the personality of everyone involved.On the way to Kanchaburi, we stopped for lunch at a restaurant on a river. The food was included in the tour and was very authentic. I, personally, don't enjoy Thai food, but my husband LOVED the food offered. I think he wants to move here.We got back on the road, and after a short gas/petrol stop, we continued into the mountains. Our guide maintained a stream of information about each area that we traveled into. I really enjoyed all of the information about Thai life and the areas we were traveling in. We reached the Elephant camp around 3 or 4 in the afternoon and proceeded to meet the trainers of the elephants. We ran into a situation in which my 8 year old daughter would have NOTHING to do with the elephants. She woudn't ride them. She wouldn't pet or feed them. Nothing. I was very obviously upset that she wouldn't interact with the animals, and the trainers took note. They tried everything to get her to pet them, including making one lay down on it's side! She was NOT having it!I stayed behind with my youngest, and let my husband and older daughter take the ride through the jungle. Then the elephants were led down to the river and I joined them.It was sooooo amazing! I mounted the elephant in the river off of a tree trunk. The elephant proceeded to dunk me in the river, and then retrieve me from the depths! Hilarious video accompanies this!After our amazing time, we were driven to our resort on the river. I can't imagine a more picturesque resort. It was so well landscaped and beautiful...until we got to the rooms... The rooms were quite shabby, and the beds were similar to cloth-covered boards. OMG! I didn't sleep a wink! Dinner was great and well serviced! We were disappointed that the pool closed at 8:00 p.m.... :(The next day we started soooo early! We trudged to our van and boarded for the stop at the Bridge. The stop was brief, which was great. We bought a few souvenirs, and then headed to the floating market.The floating market is amazing! We boarded a small boat and traversed the market, buying a myriad of items. I had a really good time.There was a long trip back to the port, but they allowed us to stop for some fast food. I enjoyed that enormously, since I was starving. I don't like Thai food, and this was very welcome!We were dropped off on time!I would HIGHLY recommend this company. I was extremely happy! The total cost, for food and accommodations was around $1400 USD for 4 people. A little pricey, but worth it!"

You truly understand your customers. Started at 6pm. Our driver was Jo. Friendly and safe. The Toyota people mover was like new. Very comfortable leather seats and good sized tv and dvd player. A long drive to the floating market. The water was quite clean and no smell and the boats are safe. The vendors had plenty of unique craft items we had not seen at other markets. A little pricy but Ok if you barter. It was far better than I had expected. The bridge over the river Kwai was amazing. Buy the book to read the story for about 200 thb ... it is history which must not be forgotten. Our guide Nam was very passionate and knowledgeable. Her insight added enormous value. Went to a local restaurant for lunch. The mango rice was very good. The elephants. ... wow!! Had been on a trek before but this way surpassed our expectations. Within 5 minutes of arriving we were each on top of an elephant head ... no seat and heading to the river. All a little anxious but the mahout (trainer) was always in total control. Into the river and before we knew it sliding down the trunk, squirting each other, standing on their head and jumping into the water only to be retrieved safely by the elephant every time. They always knew where you were and would simply slip their trunk between your legs and lift you effortlessly out of the water again. The river was very clean and flowing well but always in safe reach of the elephant who are at home in water. Nam took many photos on our phone cameras while we had an a absolute hoot for a good 1/2 hour. I can't remember the last time all our boys laughed so much. We then went for a 20 min walk on top of the elephants with a seat. I had a massive 50yo male elephant with enormous tusks. A gentle giant. Nam also took a video which she played on our return trip to Bangkok and will make available to us on youtube and dvd. Git back to the hotel around 7 pm. The video and a movie on the way home with snacks and drinks supplied made a long day very comfortable and we'll worth it. A lasting family memory we will treasure always. Special thanks to Nam!!!Thank you."

There is not one single part that I could say I liked more, the entire day was something I will never forget. From the tiny 2 week old tiger cubs wanting nothing but cuddles to the naughty teenagers who want to play all the time, to the offering to the monks to swimming with the elephants and using their trunks as water pistols against each other. Na has given us so many memories of video and photos all on disc and I don't think she missed an opportunity. Joe has the most amazing van including karaoke , movies and luxury leather seats. They both showed us nothing was ever too much trouble. Thank you so much for the most amazing memories. Please be sure to ask for Na and Joe as they are fantastic.

            "review": "Elephant, Floating Market and River Kwai Tour (1506). We are a UK family of 5 with 3 girls aged 16, 14 and 9. We considered the Tiger Temple Tour but the Tiger Temple visit itself got mixed reviews and was considerably more expensive. This tour was perfect for us as it had something for all of us. The stops broke up the 3 hour journey to the main attraction - the elephants. Mum particularly wanted to see a floating market while in Thailand. It felt very touristy but kept her happy. Dad (me) wanted to see the Bridge Over the River Kwai. I found that highly emotional - my parents were young adults in the war and so it has always been a factor I have been aware of. The war felt very close when we were walking across the bridge. The kids particularly wanted to do elephant bathing and that lived up to their expectations and exceeded ours. It was definitely worth paying the extra to go bathing - we also did the riding which is still fun but much more passive than the bathing.The other thing that made our long day - 7am pick up 7 pm return - was the quality of both the service and of the van. The van was spacious and very comfortable. It also had excellent comms facilities so we were able to watch a harrowing but ultimately uplifting film about Eric Lomax (a PoW of the Japanese) on the way there, and then a complimentary disc (video and photos) of our elephant bathing on the way back (which was delivered to our hotel the next morning). All that combined to make the journeys easy.The service came from Na our guide and Joe our driver. Na was highly knowledgeable about both the River Kwai - she is from the area and used to work at a hotel there - and about the elephants. She knew all the mahouts and elephants individually. And when my camera's memory card got full she offered me hers. Highly recommended - ask for NA and Joe if you can."

We didn't realise how much time we would spend with them and I highly recommend it for anyone looking to do any elephant excursions. Just a warning you will get completely thrown in to the water and you will see some lovely elephant poo float past you but it is completely worth it. The elephants were so so beautiful and clever and we got to ride them by ourselves for a really long time and spent ages in the water with them washing them, being thrown around and spraying water!

We picked up Bo our tour guide who was super. She took ownership of our cameras and took amazing shots. The river kwai was peaceful then nearly 4 hours with elephants on them and playing in the water was the best experience ever (300 pics and videos taken). We left then for a yummy traditional lunch onto the tigers which were super cute and heaps of them to see. This trip was worth every cent and the pictures are memories we will have for years. MY TIP; You will need likely two well charged cameras/phone, definately swim gear is needed you will be fully in the water and last of all remember to tip your driver and tour guide."

We did a little research on elephant trips and floating markets before we went and this company had some great reviews. We paid upfront by card before we went and I was a little unsure about doing this but it was no problem at all !We were collected about 7am and drove out of the city which is bonkers busy and takes about 90 mins to get to the floating market. This was interesting but hold your ground if you don't want to buy anything. It's all pretty much the same old stuff. But I do like to visit these places. Go straight in at 60% off the price of what they say you will get it. Next you drive to the restaurant near the Burma boarder which takes another hour and the lunch was great. Best banana fritters and chicken satay. Then another shorter trip to the elephants. So this is the high light of the trip. You get to feed the baby elephant so buy some bananas and some soya milk bless it's great. Then a ride on the back of the elephants on a seat. We got out of the basket and swapped with the elephant trainers and had a go at driving on the neck. Next we got into our swimming gear and then went into the river and washed and played with the elephants. I have done a few great experiences with animals like dolphins and tigers but this has to be my favourite of all. They are so soft and clever and the best fun ! These elephants are so well looked after and the guys are really great fun too. This trip is so well organised. You have your own privet minivan with reclining seats. Do it you won't be disappointed !!"

We then departed the Tiger Temple and proceeded to the Elephants this was definately a highlight riding into the river with them and splashing around again for about half hour and then we went on a small trek before returning to Bangkok. I would certainly recommend this tour. We were also given breakfast to eat while traveling from the River Kwai and stopped for lunch which was included in the cost"

Especially the banana fritters!We then went to the Elephants and wow was it worth it , we trekked around the camp by the river for about 30 minutes and then swam with them (had lots of frolicking fun!) for about 45 minutes and our guide took around 400 photo's of this and we had a DVD also.We were collected on time and delivered back exactly when we expected.DO NOT expect a short journey to Kanchanaburi , it is not far but takes time to get there and frankly in the comfort wagon we were transported in it is hardly a chore and you can watch films or if sad enough have a karaoke on the way back!

Lunch very good. Day kept all 5 of us happy from age 10,13,20,43 and 52!"

We took the \"extraordinary elephant day tour\" and what great day it was.Our driver Joe was waiting for us in our hotel foyer right on time at 7am.Our first stop was after 1and half hour at the floating market.As we were the only 3 on this tour this day Joe acted as a bit of private guide.Another hour or so Joe stopped and picked up another guide (Bo) for the rest of our trip.Next stop was the bridge on the river Kwai. Bo explained the significance behind the bridge and it's use during the war and today.Lunch was next, while not great it was good enough for us.Next came the highlight and the main reason for the tour, elephants!First it was a change into swimwear for bathing with the elephants.30mins of frolicking in the water with elephants is worth the price of this tour in itself.After the bathing comes a ride on an elephant for a short trip through the forest ( be careful of mud puddles).Sadly the day comes to an end with a 2and half hour drive back to Bangkok.Overall as I said at the outset, \" it's all about the elephants\"Daz"

We were hoping to have great tour, but little did we know just how Awesome it would be. We were picked up at our hotel around 4.30am by the delightful Joe and his amazing techno van. Along the way we picked up Na - our tour guide for the day. Na is such a deligtful knowledgeable person. We were provided with breakfast treats enroute to the bridge on the River Kwai. Due to our early start, we arrived early - thus beating the crowds - so we had the Bridge to ourselves. Such an eerily / beautiful feeling as we walked the Bridge.Then we headed to the Tiger Temple to offer food to the monks and later enjoy breakfast with the tour guides and volunteers. Also photo opportunity with the tiger cubs. Na certainly kept us moving :). All the time Na and Joe capturing every moment for us on our cameras.After bathing one of the cubs and feeding it chicken mince, we walked a juvenile tiger down to the canyon and had photos taken with the larger tiger. Then we headed off to elephants.The bond between the elephants and their mahouts was a pleasure to see. We enjoyed ourselves immensley. Then came the Absolute HIGHLIGHT. Swimming with the elephants OMG. Awesome :). Na & Joe capturing every moment for us on our camera and video camera. True pros, and the mahouts made sure we had a Fabulous time with their beloved elephants. After having lunch at a local riverside restaurant (yum) we were on our way back to our hotel. Joe played our video in his van so we could sit back and relive the Fabulous day we had just experienced. We cannot recommend Na - Joe & Bangkok Day Tours Highly enough. it's just over 1yr ago and we are still raving on about it.Lifetime memoires captured by Na & Joe.

Joe picked us up at our hotel, right on time, and I was amazed at how well he navigated the busy Thailand roads. He was very helpful and provided lots of helpful tips when stopping at the floating market. Na was an amazing tour guide and was always willing to share some great information with us and snap some photos. She took some amazing photos of us on the elephant tour just using my iPhone. The food at the Bridge on the River Kwai restaurant was delicious and there were plenty of gluten free options.The van was extremely comfortable, and on the way back, we were able to doze off and enjoy some movies.Would highly recommend Na & Joe and the elephant tour to anyone!"

I went on the elephant experience with my boyfriend, by the end of the day we were so speechless and could not get over the events of the day. We got picked up from our hotel at 7am by our driver who did not speak much English but was friendly. We drove all day and saw the floating market which was not something I was expecting but was a nice enough detour. We continued driving after being given some snacks and water by the driver and picked up Na. Eventually we arrived at the bridge at the River Kwai and had a lovely tour with Na who took some fantastic pictures of us and was highly informative. Then we had a buffet meal which was traditional food of the region and also free/included in the price (drinks not included). By the time we arrived in kanchanaburi for the elephant ride we were tired and a bit sweaty but as soon as we saw where we were and the elephants wandering around we were overwhelmed. We were both astounded by how different the landscape was and how beautiful the elephants were. We swam in the river with them for an hour or so and had the time of our lives. Na took quite literally 500 photos and videos of us on our phones and made it so memorable that we could not be more thankful. Then we had a ride on another elephant who we think is called \"Chung Chung\" and was able to ride it without the trainer through the jungle! Animals seemed very happy and very we'll looked after they were able to roam around and do their own thing, they seemed to be very attached to their trainers. Even though it rained the entire time it did not affect our day and we will talk about it to anyone who will listen! Experience of a lifetime, must do if you can spare a day at a really modest price. A lot of driving but totally worth it!"

She took so many pictures that as I was looking at them, I could imagine I was back in the water with the elephants. The first stop at the river market was fun at first but got a bit overwhelming as most of the prices were over inflated and we felt very \"cheated\" but this is not the tours fault at all - just part of the tourism industry. We then picked up Nu and went to the bridge. Sad but beautiful place. Lunch was very nice at the buffet. They saved the best for last, the elephants! The baby elephant was as funny as Nu described and playing in the water was fabulous. Would recommend this to anyone!"

Her explanation of the history of the bridge, guiding me through local customs and explaining the subtlety of the language was really valuable and made a memorable day even better.I was picked up from my hotel at 4:30 in the morning in an air conditioned 4WD vehicle and was provided with a nice light breakfast on the way. The meal at lunchtime was really nice - though now I have to figure out the recipe for the deep fried banana!

This trip was booked from home and coincided two days after the Anzac Day memorial service. We were met ten minutes early at the hotel by our guide Kent. Kent was informative, relaxed, funny and gave an outline of the day.Right on time, our personal SUV turned up, looked more like a limo than a car and off we went. Hellfire Pass was the end destination some three hours drive. We we entertained the whole way by Kent.We got a history of Bangkok, a stop st a war memorial and the bridge on route to the pass. On each occasion, we were given great info, interactive questions and as it turned out, Kent was a very handy photographer!!!!The memorial was respectful and well kept, the bridge was a great experience only topped by Hellfire Pass.The drive took a while but the tour driver was great and made it feel a very safe trip. Hellfire Pass means a lot to Australian and their allies. The memorial is not commercial, very clean, professional and respectful. As we walked to the cutting, Kent gave great insight into the history and significance of the cutting.There were flags and personal momentos from Anzac Day which added to the day. Kent wished at the start of the day that we weren't disappointed, and we weren't. I would recommend Hellfire Pass to anyone with an understanding of history and the significance of sacrifice.The tour ended with a lovely Thai lunch at a nearby village and an informative drive back to the hotel. Thank to the driver and to Kent who was great. A special well done as Kent hurt his back on the bus getting to the hotel and he soldiered on the whole day....Highly recommended company and tour, a highlight of our trip to Thailand."

The 4x4 was v comfy, and it was just my husband and I, our driver and guide from the River Kwai. Mr O. our driver was great- I wasn't feeling well and he reassured me any time we needed to stop (for the loo) just to let him know-means alot when you find car journeys stressful! I found the floating market a little too touristy- would expect that from a coach trip, but not with a private tour such as this. The floating market we were taken to seemed to be set up just for tourists- with each stall selling the usual tourist bumpf. I was expecting something more 'authentic' with locals shopping-but no-just boatfuls of tourists being pulled to each stall by the holder with a long pole trying to sell you mass produced goods. In contrast the River Kwai Bridge was fascinating thanks to our insightful guide, Angie. Lunch was good, and then on to the elephant sanctuary, which was an amazing experience. The elephants appeared well looked after and happy- We both were torn about whether it is an ethical thing to do...but I guess in England we ride horses...and elephants are much stronger! Angie took numerous photos for us. We snoozed with happy memories of the day for the 5.5hr drive back to the hotel!"

I wasn't pointing fingers at the tour company but naturally my mood was low since my card had trouble going through to make the required reservation payment. Surprisingly though, Bangkok Day Tours responded more than timely to all my email messages to help me get the task done. Next came more issues though. My friends and I arrived a day late in Bangkok thanks to an unfortunate travel delay which forced me to request Bangkok Day Tours to change our reservation date to the next day instead. They surprised me again with their quick email response and no hassle, the date of our tour got changed last minute with no issue. Wow, not what i expected judging from past experiences with other companies. So then came the tour, we chose the Extraordinary Elephant Day Trip. Our transportation was a real nice, big van that more than definitely satisfied our comfort needs. We went to a Floating Market, had a great lunch, got to see the bridge on the River Kwai, and hang out with elephants in the river! It was all amazing fun! So many memories made that we will keep from the countless pictures and videos that were created.Special thanks to our tour guide Tanya and our driver Mr. Jo for guiding us through an amazing experience in Thailand and helping with taking some of the pictures and videos while we were in the river with the elephants!Special thanks to the whole Bangkok Day Tours company for exceeded our expectations and making it all possible!

Just the 2 of us on the tour (that's usual apparently). They had some food & drink for breakfast for us if we had wanted it. Sally, the guide and Mr T the driver were perfect hosts.After visiting the Bridge over the Kwai, we arrived at the Monastery at around 7am.

It was a very busy day.If I had any complaints at all, it would be that we had a little trouble understanding our guides' accent. Her English was very good, but the accent was difficult to understand, but we found this to be true in most of the Asian cities that we visited.One other complaint was that at the end of the tour, we were taken to a big gem store, shown a film and tossed out into a giant showroom. After speaking with other cruise passengers, it appears to be where everyone \"visits\" - LOL. The pressure was minimal and the store had some high quality stingray wallets, purses, etc, so we did spend some $ there. After visiting all the ports, it turns out that we got the best price and the best quality on these items, so I cannot complain too much.

We were concerned and we contact Bangkok Day Tours to see if we can get our deposit back if the protest got out of hand. We were rest assured that we would not go through where the protest was happening and they even sent us a video of recent tours they did where they went around the protests with no issues. We were still uneasy, but after reading their terms and condition, it clearly states that no refund is issued due to political unrest. This is unfair, but it is spelled out. In any event, we did not cancel our tours with Bangkok Day Tours. Thank goodness we didn't. On the day of our tours, we were met in our lobby timely, our tour guide (Green was her name) was personable and spoke English well. Our van was clean and spacious (there was 4 of us) and our driver was good. The tours that we booked were the Floating Market & Grand Palace Tours and the Ayutthaya Palaces & Lunch Cruise Tour. The fee paid includes all tickets and lunch. Both of these tours did not even come close to the protests.The only time we came across the protests, which was peaceful by the way, was when we went on our own to MBK, Central World and the other shopping centers around the area. Green, our tour guide, gave us suggestions what to avoid and how to take the sky train to avoid area."

After cancelling elephant tour with another camp (saw some bad treatment), I made a booking with Bangkok Day Tours. I contacted them prior to check how they care about animals' treatment and ask them to ensure me that there will be not mistreatment on the camp we are going. They explained to me how things are working and I booked the trip (read details about all tours since there are significant differences in activities: I suggest the morning trip to the Tiger Sanctuary and elephant ride and bath, tour 1511).First, the organization is very good; I was picked up from my hotel on schedule; the driver and the guide were there waiting for me. The car (minivan for me) was clean and in a very good condition; they had water and soda for me and later on, a little breakfast. They prepared as well food to give to the Monks, which is a part of this tour. We had sensational visit at Tiger temple. This tour offers the exclusivity to participate (in a very small group) in all morning activities with tigers (from babies to adults). I could feed babies, play and walk with young tigers, give them a bath and play with adults. Those moments were just extraordinary.After the tigers Sanctuary we went directly to elephant camp (in the morning there are only few people so you have a sensation of privacy). I took a ride (chair) and we spent quite a long time to walk and stop in the forest. The elephant was allowed to stop and eat fresh leaves from the trees. I did not see the elephant's guide mistreating the animal at any time (if the fact that I have told him that I would not support the mistreatment helped, it is even better, we participated in their education). The sticks they carry should be used only if there is a problem (elephant could have an unpredictable reaction, it is a wild animal after all). After the ride, we changed the elephant and went to the bath in the river (no chair); I must say that sitting directly on the elephant is a great experience. The second elephant guide was great too: he used only voice to guide the elephant and we had a lot of fun; again on both ways the animal was permitted to eat and stop at her convenience.Having said all that, I am very pleased with the tour and all my concerns were addressed. Do not hesitate to inform the agency about your concerns and they will take good care of them.We had our planned lunch after all activities which allowed us to have more time in the morning and especially have less crowd around us at all times.I do recommend this tour if you want to have a great experience with tigers and elephants in very decent conditions with all respect to animals."

We opted for trip Number 1506 which was a trip on the floating market, the bridge over the river Kwai and the highlight a trek, including bathing with Elephants.The trip to the floating market was an experience even to those of us who don't do markets. It was hectic and right in your face, in a nice way. It was a reflection of heavy manic tourist trail sales. But it was an extremely good experience to see the Thai people working hard to make a living. The bartering is all part of the experience as well. Be prepared to expect to do it and enjoy.The Bridge over the River Kwai was a moving experience if you know your history and are of an age when you remember how the bridge was constructed by POW'sWe stopped for lunch which was part of the overall cost, in a typical roadside restaurant where the food was plentiful and fresh. every strength of Thai curry was available to sample.The on to the highlight of the day with the elephants. We started with a reasonable trek with the elephants and the handler's were very supportive and patient encouraging us to get right on to of the Elephant's neck, which is a considerable height from the ground. We got the opportunity to feed the Elephants a basket full of bananas which was an amazing sight to see him crunch and swallow them skins and all.Then it was down to the river to swim and bathe with the Elephants, what an experience this is. they threw us off of their back's into the water and allowed us to use their trunk as hoses to spray each other. They were obvious used to doing this as they seemed to do it in unison with each other. This was all done with the aid of the expert handler's.Our guide was amazing, she looked after us very well and operated our cameras and took the best pictures and short videos for us.It was a day which we all agreed we would treasure.All included in this deal were refreshments, light snacks, lunch, A tour guide and transport from the hotel."

The tour we went on took us to an elephant park where the elephant walks in a circle all day long. The ride was about 15 min, not exactly what we expected. Additionally many of the pictures on the website shows people riding bareback- not an option we were given. All of the elephants at the park had chairs strapped to them. While our tour guide was very nice, I wouldn't recommend this tour if you have a conscience."

Upon being picked up at our hotel, there was a little mix-up over which tour we were supposed to be going on. However, after a quick phone call, our tour guide, Kent, straightened everything out and we were on our way. The tour company was also good about emailing me and apologizing for the minor mishap. We were transported around in a nice air conditioned SUV with reclining backseats, which made the long drive nice and relaxing (and allowed time for a little nap). The tour consisted of a morning trip to the Bridge Over the River Kwai and the memorial cemetery with lunch at a local floating restaurant. After that we headed to the infamous Tiger Temple for an afternoon tour. Since there was some initial confusion over which tour we would be going on, Kent quickly jumped in to make sure we had tickets for everything we wanted to do at the Tiger Temple (feeding the baby tigers and walking the adult ones). He was really helpful with knowing how to optimize our time at the Tiger Temple too. Overall it was a very enjoyable day and well organized tour."

The mini bus was lovely and comfortable and we could watch our video in the bus on our way home after the trip. Our Guide who was Nah (not sure if I spelt this right) and our driver Joe, were absolutely fantastic. We had the time of our lives and it is definitely one off the tick list. From start to finish Nah took control told us everything we needed to know, took amazing photoes and nothing was too much trouble. We went to the Bridge first as Nah advised no one goes early and she was right, by the time we had walked it visitors were arriving, but because there was only us there Nah took some lovely photos of us on the bridge with no one else around. From there we went to the Tiger Temple, which was amazing to see them, feed them play and wash them. The handlers were great and put you in the right places and stayed with you . We then went onto the elephant camp where we bathed the elephants, or should I say they bathed us, so much fun and my favourite animals, big gentle giants. We had a really lovely day which we will cherish and thank you to Nah for making it memorable. Would recommend it, as it is something special."

            "review": "Floating market and elephant ride/bath. My mother and I booked this full day tour on our last day in Bangkok. It was convenient and easy to book and the company was good about communicating via email.On the day of the tour we were picked up by a driver and taken to the floating market a few hours away. The floating market was essentially just a ride in a boat for a half hour or so, which was perfectly fine. It would have been nice to have a guide present who spoke English. All we had at this point in the tour was a driver, we didn't actually meet our guide until almost lunch time. We met our guide and stopped at the bridge over the river Kwai on the way to lunch, which was a cool stop but essentially just a photo op. Part of the reason we booked this tour is because after having heard that some of the elephant experiences were a bit inhumane, the idea of the elephant bath sounded better. In retrospect that was probably a poor assumption. It seemed okay but not particularly elephant friendly. The elephant portion consisted of a ride (in a chair strapped to the elephant like you see in all the tours) with a trainer present, all of whom were carrying and using bull hooks. The elephants seemed decently happy and would stop and snack during the ride, and the ride itself was pretty fun, with our guide taking lots of photos for us. I was, however, somewhat disappointed with the \"bath\" portion. I was expecting to swim around next to the elephant and wash it a bit. It turned out to be more like a circus performance, with the trainer yelling at the elephant and jamming the bull hook into its ear to make it do tricks and poses for pictures. It made for good photos but wasn't really what I wanted and I ended up just feeling bad for the elephant.This was a decent day tour, but if you care about booking an elephant experience in which they are well treated, I suggest trying one of the elephant sanctuaries elsewhere."

We were picked up very early, and driven to the Bridge over the River Kwai. We saw the bridge and the memorial before heading up towards the Burma border for the tiger temple. Once there we offered food to the monks, and received their blessing to enter the temple. That's when the fun began. I got to bottle feed a baby tiger, play with one. Walk a grown tiger, bath one, feed it, and then play with it. Defiantly an enlightening experience. After than we went to the Elephant camp and rode elephants into the water, where we played with them and had some great photo ops. We then dried off, and rode them around the area for a few more minuets. Once we left we went to a buffet in the local area (it was paid for by the tour), and had an amazing day. Really it was the best amount of money I ever spent on a day tour. Everything about them was professional and courteous. I would recommend them to everyone."

My partner and I booked the one day tour (1512 breakfast with elephants) Just incredible.Picked up from our hotel in a luxury mini van just for us at 0430 by Jo, our very friendly driver with the coolest van in town! Endless supplies of complimentary bottled water provided in an iced cool box along with snacks for the journey at no extra cost! We stopped in Kanchaniburi to collect our tour guide for the day, his name was Aek (pronounced a bit like ?eight). We couldn't of asked for a nicer, more knowledgeable or friendlier tour guide. He was ideal for us. We then drove a short distance to the bridge over the river Kwai and watched the sunrise, words do not do this day justice.Then all four of us traveled to the Chang Palace, private breakfast included in the tour here. we watched the elephants perform a little routine, although many were chained they appeared well looked after, a concern that we had was gone. We then went on a solo bare back ride around the camp, with mahouts to guide by foot, we had learnt from Aek a few commands but the mahouts helped out when our elephants stopped to graze! We had our own elephants Fen and Fanta. Beautiful animals. We then rode them to the river Kwai where they walked straight in with us on their backs. We got to play with them and even gave them a wash. After we brought some bananas and fed them. Photos constantly taken by Aek on our cameras, brilliant! Take a change of clothes and a towel as there are shower facilities here, you'll need them after a soaking in the river! We then drove to the death railway and hellfire pass, walking on this railway is just amazing. Off for lunch at a little restaurant, meal again included in the tour.Time for Tiger Temple, I won't spoil it for you, but this is just as breath taking as the morning with the elephants. Lots of photos and even the chance to walk with a tiger. Ladies must wear appropriate temple clothing and both men and women must wear non bright clothing, unless you want to be a tigers lunch!The only added expense of the day was for some of the souvenirs and a small tip for the mahouts as a thank you for such an unforgettable day! All in all this day is an absolute must. We would not have changed a single thing. Loved it. The memories will last for ever."

            "review": "One day - River Kwai, Tiger Temple, Lunch, Elephant Camp. This tour made my girlfriend and I\u2019s trip to Thailand unforgettable. First stop was the bridge over the river Kwai, ideal timing the bridge was a bit dark when we first arrived but by the time the history had been explained and questions answered it was bright enough for a photo opportunity. We then went on the morning trip to the tiger temple (where we gave the monks food in the morning) and it was by far one of the coolest things I have ever experienced in my life. We got to play with the 3-4 week old tigers and bottle-fed the 1 month-1 year old tigers. I was playing with the 1month old like I would a puppy. I had a leash and would place it just out of his reach and he would jump at it and attack it. After playing with the tiger cubs we walked them over to a washing station where we struggled to wash them (because they kept walking around in circles). Then we got to feed them some chicken. The whole time the staff was very helpful getting the tigers into great photo opportunities and taking photos with your camera. Then it was off to play with some of the bigger tigers. We got to have these noisemakers on sticks and play with the tigers just like big cats. It was incredible the tigers were so happy jumping after these colourful cardboard boxes filled with noise-making things. Then we got to walk with the fully grown tigers down to a canyon. The one we walked was about 220kg and stopped at one point to scratch up a tree. Then we got a chance to have one of the biggest tigers in our lap. At one point he yawned and right up at me and I admit I was a little frightened but all of the staff members kept the tigers away from any potentially dangerous situations. After the tiger photo they had 6-7 fully grown tigers playing together in this small canyon and they were fighting each other and chasing each other around the area. They were so playful and having fun there was no possible way they were drugged. In fact as playtime was winding down one of the tigers got out of the enclosure and the rest chased after it and the staff had to go get them back on leashes and control the situation. Though they are large dangerous animals staff make you feel safe and comfortable around the animals. They show the animals respect them and are content in the level of domestication.I think where some of the negativity comes from is the people that just see the tigers in the afternoon when they are stationary and being put on display for hundreds of people getting photos and touching them. We paid a little extra for the morning tour but it was absolutely amazing and if I ever go back to Thailand I would 100% do this tour again. Staff at the tiger temple explained the tigers are generally calm animals during the heat of the day and more active during the night (note when you go to the zoo tigers are laying there doing nothing) and more nocturnal animals. The same 220 kg tiger who happily rested his head on the laps of all 14 of the visitors, was up and running around fighting and jumping instantly when he knew it was playtime. The tigers are very used to human contact but it is reasonable to have rules and follow the instructions given. They are wild animals and will do what they want (for example stop and claw a tree while being walked) but it just adds to the experience. Not only did BANGKOK DAY TOURS have a private air-conditioned van for the 2 of us but we also had the best English-speaking guide out of all the other tours that were there at the same time. SALLY was very knowledgeable about everything throughout the entire tour and we never had any communication issues. Sally answered every question we asked thoughtfully (and trust me we asked everything we could think of). She also took photos with our cameras as well as her own camera to ensure we had plenty of quality photos. We received our photos by email the very next day. The photos are unbelievable amazing. We did not once have to think about taking our own photos and missing out on enjoying the experience. Lunch was wonderful and had both Western and Thai options. The elephants were in the 2nd part of the trip. We did a quick walk around riding a seat on an elephant together. We then each got on our own elephant without a seat and proceeded to go right into the river with them. The manhout (spelling?) had the elephants trained so well that they would pick us up with their trunks and dive deep into the water giving us the ride of our life. We got to stand up on the elephants as they raised themselves out of the water and we got to jump off. We could go on and on about how amazing the entire tour was. We would do the tour over and over again. The tour may be more expensive done this way but don't cheap out and go for just the temple or just the elephants or without a guide (she helped translate and instructed us on getting the best experience for us all day and throughout our stay in Thailand in general). The fabulous tour, did not disappoint. Thank you BANGKOK DAY TOURS and SALLY for giving us some unforgettable memories."

The price is a little expensive in comparison to everything else in Thailand, but not expensive considering what you get. We received a call from the company with in 5 minutes of booking to confirm which was comforting considering we booked online. Our driver picked us up from our Hotel at 6:45am (scheduled for 7am) in a luxurious van. It was a spacious 5 person van for just the two of us. They provided unlimited bottled water for us and gave is snacks. After about 45 minutes of driving our driver stopped for a coffee and bathroom break. Then after another 45 minutes we arrived at the floating market. Our driver set us up with a private boat which brought us around to all the different vendors. Really cool because they hook your boat to pull you closer so they can try and sell you there merchandise. It's mainly touristy goods and you have to bargain! End up paying about 25% of the original starting price. After this we got back in the van and drive about 30 more minutes, picked up our English speaking guide and went to the bridge over the River Kwai. Once there we walked the bridge, took pictures, ate lunch and bought a jade bracelet.This was followed by a 45 minute drive to the Tiger Zoo. Our guide brought us everywhere which made things easy and convenient for us. We took a few pictures with the adult tigers - our guide held our back pack the whole time so we weren't bothered with it, then went on to feed the cubs (3 weeks old and very cute) and also got up close with 6 month old Tigers (although young they are the size of a Great Dane!). We then left the zoo, drove 30 minutes and dropped off our guide, then another 2 hours back to our hotel. Impeccable door to door service, very comfortable ride, very friendly staff and definitely worth it. Would highly recommend!"

            "review": "Amazing trip to Tiger Temple!. My husband and I booked a trip through Bangkok Day Tours to see the bridge on the river Kwai (not the movie, the actual bridge!) and the Tiger Temple. We were 100% happy with the trip, and especially with our amazing guide, Sally, who saved the day numerous times!!When the SUV came to get us from our hotel at 4:30 a.m., we were a little confused: We had the notion that we would be taking a crowded bus filled with other tourists to our destination. However, we had the spacious SUV all to ourselves, Sally, and our driver! That was a very nice surprise.After about a two-hour drive, we reached the bridge on the river Kwai, where Sally gave us a brief history of the place and explained that, although it was early and quite chilly, we had come at a good time before the usual throngs of tourists showed up. We got to walk across the bridge and take scenic photos just as the sun was coming up, which was very beautiful. As we headed back to the SUV, Sally and the driver (I forgot his name, I feel awful about that!) hopped into a nearby store to pick us up some breakfast. Sally explained that, although we were set to have breakfast with the monks at the Tiger Temple, for the past few days the tours had included record-breaking numbers, so we should at least eat a little bit in case there wasn't enough food at the temple or we had to wait in a long line (she was right about that!). We ate the provided food on the way.When we got to the Tiger Temple, Sally found us a spot to give the monks their food offerings and provided us with our tickets. She gave us a rundown of what to do when the monks passed us, and even took a few photos for us.Inside the temple, Sally led us to the best spots to get prime pictures with the baby and young tigers while most of the other tourists ate breakfast (see, told ya she was right!). During this time, my husband and I realized that our camera battery was dying and we hadn't brought another one (such a rookie mistake!). Sally happily offered to take our pictures with her cell phone camera, and she even emailed them to us afterward!With Sally leading the way, we got to spend quality time with the tigers. She explained to us the history of the temple and how volunteers help run the place. We even talked about the controversy surrounding the temple and how so many people think the tigers are drugged or abused. Let me make myself clear on this point: I am an avid animal lover. I am aware that there is a serious problem in Thailand regarding the treatment of elephants, monkeys, and other animals. However, after seeing the situation with my own eyes, I do NOT think the tigers at the temple are drugged or abused. As the owner of two cats, I can tell you that the tigers behaved so like tamed house cats that it was astonishing. They sleep after they eat (and basically just when they want to, which is often), they enjoy being petted on certain areas of their bodies (some even like tummy rubs, like my cats!), and they love to play. They get cranky when tired, and sometimes they just want to be left alone. The workers and volunteers at the temple make sure that human visitors are protected from the wayward swipe of a tiger's claw, but for the most part, they're not bothered by humans. They've been raised by and with humans their whole lives, and unlike tigers in the wild, they don't see humans as prey (unless provoked!).In any case, the day at the Tiger Temple was amazing. Our friends and family were blown away by the pictures we showed them of us feeding and playing with the tigers (all thanks to Sally!), and we had the experience of a lifetime! I'd absolutely recommend this company to anyone traveling to Bangkok!"

Tour guides and driver were fantastic, did everything they possibly could to make sure we had an amazing day. We saw bridge over river kwai and tiger temple and the old train tracks (can't remember what its called), and did the elephants in the water. The elephants are so happy and the mahouts are awesome fun too. Honestly such an amazing experience, being so close to those elephants, its indescribable. Great that we had lots of photos taken of us too so that we can cherish the memories forever.Honestly I think the elephant part of the tour overshadowed the rest. Tiger temple I wasn't too keen on - I've read too much about how they are drugged etc and I found the tigers to be very sad and unhappy. The elephants however were full of life and loved having us climbing all over them in the water.Do it do it do it for the elephant part. You will not regret it. Absolutely perfect!!!!!Thank you Bangkok day tours!!! I am planning another trip to Thailand at the end of this year and will definitely be doing the tour again !!!!!Oh and ps the food was amazing!!! Sooo much food!"

We had our own van pick us up at our hotel. The van has reclining comfortable seats for everyone and also a cooler for snacks since its a long day. The pick up time was 4:30am since it was quite a trip, but we all fell asleep very comfortable in the van on the 2 hour trip. Our tour guide was amazing. She knew exactly what to do at each stop so that we maximized our time. She made sure we were first to each station so that we didn't miss any opportunities including feeding the baby tigers and getting our picture taken with the large tigers. She also brought us a lunch so that we didn't have to waste time eating there and missing the opportunities to see what we came for. We would absolutely do this again and couldn't imagine going all the way to Thailand and not doing this tour. It was the best day of all of our lives."

Guide Molly and driver Joe outstanding. Vehicle modern, comfortable and very cool. We were concerned about the safety aspect of the elephant riding but Caroline assured us it was perfectly safe and she was absolutely correct. Picked up on time, safe driver, beautiful van, informative guide.The elephant ride was fun as was bathing and playing with the elephants in the water. We watched an elephant paint a picture of flowers (that was better than anything we could paint) and bought the masterpiece for 50 Baht. There were clean showers to use after bathing so we could clean up and change into clean clothes  The Tiger Temple was truly amazing. Viewing and petting the big tigers was a thrill and playing with and feeding the cubs is beyond description. We ended the day with a visit to the Bridge of the River Kwai which was a nice way to finish the day. Molly and Joe surprised us with a \"disco\" light and music show in the van on the way home. Molly was quick to get the tickets to play and feed the baby tigers which was key because we were the first group in and had quality play and feeding time. As we were leaving, the cubs all went to sleep so subsequent groups might not have had the same experience. Molly and Joe also got us to the elephant park early so we were the first people there and had the place to ourselves most of the time. Molly and Joe used our cameras to take super pictures which have made all our friends and family jealous. Joe ran the entire way while we were riding the elephant so he could keep up. The buffet lunch was just right. Thanks Caroline."

Our driver did not speak English so we don't know if he was just as awesome, but he was a great driver. We were always safe and our belongings kept secure. We did tour 1118 which included the floating markets, jungle elephant ride (no bath as we did not want to get wet), tiger temple and bridge on the River Kwai. It was phenomenal! The elephant ride was perfect, about 20 minutes long and the mahout took great pics of us on the elephant whose name was Happy. The tiger temple was absolutely unforgettable. We paid to feed baby tigers, but it was sold-out by the time we got there. But our guide Anda is very well known and respected at the temple, so he was able to get us extra pictures with tigers, including us holding a 6 week old cub. Priceless! He also helped us get first in line for everything because he knows the way the temple works so well. He took great pics of us and his humor helped us enjoy the day even more. He also provided us great history and culture on Thailand. WHat a nice guy! I highly recommend BDT and this tour and Anda!"

            "review": "Once in a lifetime experience--tour 1506 Extraordinary Elephant Day Trip.. Riding into the river on an elephant's neck is a once in a lifetime experience which, for us, was made possible by a tour we booked with Bangkok Day Tours. The entire process from booking to being dropped off back at our hotel was easy and professionally handled. We made the reservation online, where our questions were answered via email, and we made a deposit with a credit card. The balance was due in cash when the driver picked us up at the hotel.The driver picked us up on time in a fairly new large van. He was very pleasant, and more importantly (during approximately 7 hours on the road) a safe driver. Snacks and cold drinks were provided. We went to the floating market first, which is fun to see. If you want to buy something be prepared for some bargaining, or you will pay way too much. Our guide joined us on the way to our next destination, the bridge over the river Kwai (okay Khwae). This was interesting, though nothing like the bridge in the movie. It was fun to see the old train come by.We expected to eat lunch at the restaurant by the bridge, but apparently it was full so we went to another place on the way to the elephants. This was the only disappointment of the day, as the food was mediocre at best. We looked forward to some real Thai food, but instead the buffet consisted mainly of not-very-good western food, such as spaghetti.Then off to the elephant park, where we each hopped on our own elephant (with mahout behind us) and walked down into the river. Riding on these enormous beasts was an amazing experience. They don't just sit there, they rear up on the hind legs and then splash down under water, they squirt you (or your companions if you aim their trunk), and the mahouts will have you stand on the elephant's head or ride on its trunk, if you are feeling adventurous. All the while the staff took pictures for a DVD (included) and our guide took pictures with our camera.After that, we watched a brief elephant show (dancing Gangnam style!) and hand fed an elephant bananas. Next was the \"jungle\" ride in a two-person saddle on an elephant's back. This was a bit of a let down after the river experience, and the jungle was more of a loop around the housing area for the compound. It was still neat to experience an elephant close up, but if possible get the river experience.Then it was time for the long drive back to our hotel in Bangkok. This took almost 4 hours, but the driver did a great job. The picture DVD did not make it to our hotel before we left at 2:15 am, but Caroline Boonsong mailed it to us free of charge the next day. And that says it all about Bangkok Day Tours, efficient and customer oriented. We recommend them unreservedly."

            "review": "Tiger Temple and Elephant Bathing. Myself and three friends were visiting Bangkok from the States. We decided to take a day excursion outside the city and found bangkokdaytours.com online before we left. We booked the Tiger Temple and Elephant Bathing tour. The day of the excursion, we met our driver in the lobby of our hotel, and we had a mini van all to ourselves. The driver went over our itinerary for the day, had snacks in the car, and made sure we had everything we needed before we started the trip. We drove about 2 hours outside Bangkok, then picked up our guide for the day, Na. She was amazing. Such a friendly and knowledgeable guide, who explained everything in great detail. When we made our first stop at the Bridge over the River Kwai, Na took control of my camera and started taking pictures from all over the place. She would suggest backgrounds, then get us together for group photos. She even taught me a thing or two about my camera. Once we got to the Tiger Temple, Na knew all the best seats and angles to get things on camera, as well as, get the best views of the tigers. She was a huge help and I cannot speak highly enough about her. She did the same thing when we got to the elephant bathing, and we beat the crowd for the lunch spot we stopped at. Na even brought us a special entree from the chef.If you're going to Bangkok and want something outside the city, I would highly recommend Bangkok Day Tours, and I would highly recommend requesting Na as your guide. I've never had an experience like this one, and it was the highlight of our trip."

            "review": "(1 of 9) Bangkok Weekend Floating Market Tour 1006. I booked 9 tours from home (U.S.) over the internet; 2 tours are custom, and 2 others I altered by adding or deleting stops, and the remaining 5 are as is. The booking process was easy and Caroline Boonsong, the person I was corresponding, was very patient as my interests would change and I altered my trips. Truth be told, I was uneasy booking all the tours from abroad, but I did my reasearch using Tripadvisor and felt as comfortable as I could.Yesterday, all fears were put to rest. I took my first tour and it was amazing! Molly was my tour guide. Just to be safe, I arrived in the lobby 10 mins prior to the arranged meeting time; Molly was already there! She introduced herself and within 5 mins, I was so at ease, I felt like I was traveling with a friend. The car that showed up was a large van. It was clean, comfortable and spacious; comparable to what I would find back in the U.S. I am 6'2\" (~188 cm) and had plenty of room.As we were driving, I told her, yesterday, when I was on my own, I tried to walk to a flower market but got lost and didn't make it. I'm not sure if the set route was to to take me through it, but we ended up there. I guess she could tell I was very interested in it (by me struggling to take pics of the flowers from the moving van,) so she asked if I would be interested in walking to the pier, thru the flower market! I jumped at the chance! This is just one example of how Molly tweeked/adjust the itinerary as she learned more and more about me. She is the definition of excellent customer service! As we went throught the flower market, she pointed out how individual items were made, why they were made and the local significance to the economy. I could tell she was listening to the questions I asked, and taloiring the information to match my interests. She also made the tour interactive by asking me questions and joking with me. I won't bore you with a step by step account of the day, but I want to spell out what else I did. Once we reached the pier, we traveled to Wat Arun (which I climbed,) took a private long-tailed boat to the Taling Chan Floating Market, where we had lunch, and rode the van back to the hotel. It was amazing day! Everywhere we went, Molly offered to take pictures of me with my camera. This was a huge deal for me. As a solo traveler, it can be difficult to get pictures of myself traveling. I tend not to ask strangers because I don't want to impose; very early on, Molly made sure I didn't feel this way :) As I said before, this is the first of nine tours I booked (I hope to review them all.) If Molly is the norm at Bangkok Day Tours, I will be having an amazing trip!"

            "review": "Elephant Trek and floating market. We were picked up at 7am promptly from our hotel and met our driver and guide (Nam). She was very friendly and spoke good English. We were in a mini van to ourselves and expected to be picking up others, as there were meant to be 5 other people on the same tour that day, but never did and ended up having our own tour guide and driver to ourselves the whole day.We had about an hour and a half drive to our first stop which was a floating market. Here we met another girl who was on our tour who also had her own car with driver and guide.The floating market is very interesting and is quite an experience going round haggling while in a boat. You get in a boat taxi and get rowed around the market by the driver, who takes you up and down most of the \"isles\" time permitting. You have half hour on the boat and then a further half hour walking around the hardstanding bit. If you show any interest in the goods being sold then the sellers tend to grab your boat to stop you being rowed away. If you do wish to buy anything then haggle down to about 30% of the original price! My gf bought 2 scarves which started out at 950 baht for one and eventually got 2 for 900 baht and thought we had got a good deal! We asked our guide later who said you should pay about 200 baht for each scarf! Haggle, haggle, haggle!After the market we went to the River Kwai which was another half hour or so driving. The bridge is still used as a train line and we were fortunate to be there when a train came along and watch it slowly chug over the bridge. We walked along the full length to the other side and back and got lovely views on the bridge and down the river. Quite beautiful.After this half hour stop we went on again, ten or 15 minutes to a little restaurant for lunch. It was a buffet style and looked a nice place. However, as I was pouring sugar into my coffee I noticed tiny little bugs crawling around in the sugar jug. Yuk! That put me off everything unfortunately and I watched other people go up and use the sugar oblivious. We also used the toilets here which were not great. We were able to leave whenever we were ready so just had a brief 30 minute break then jumped in the van to be whisked away to the highlight - the elephant trekking.This was another 30 minutes or so in the car and when we arrived we could see the elephants already walking about carrying people. It looked amazing!We had a short wait until a queue of people had been and during this time were able to see 2 baby elephants and stroke and feed them.When our turn came we both got on the basket atop an elephant and began the tour walking around. All the while our guide, Nam, was on the ground taking lots of photos on her camera for us. Our guide on the elephant also kindly took photos using our camera and then did something we were not expecting. He got off the elephant and told us to get down from the basket and sit on the elephants head to control it. We both took turns of this and he took dozens of photos of us and gave us things to feed the elephant with. It was amazing and it seemed no-one else was being given this chance to sit on the head. He was obviously after a tip but he deserved one as being in control of the elephant while it was walking along was incredible.Eventually he jumped back on and we finished the circuit. It was about half hour I think that we was on the elephant but if we had not stopped for so many photos while we were on the head then probably would have been over much quicker as it was not a big circuit.Then as soon as we got off the elephant they told us to get ready to go down into the river to get wet! We got on an elephant each directly on its' neck and went down to the river Kwai.They have an area that is enclosed so there is no current and it is shallow so you can stand up pretty much anywhere in it, except for further out. The river is brown and dirty and we both had a bit of earache the next day but it was so worth it! We spent 21 minutes in the river with the elephants which seemed forever! They let you climb their trunks and you get thrown in the water over and over again. Very enjoyable and energy sapping! We stood on the heads and jumped off, anything you want to do really. The whole time Nam was taking photos from the river bank and another man also took photos using our camera. It was brilliant and I would recommend to anyone. If you didn't do this bit then it would be a bit boring.After we had finished here they gave us shower gel and led us to where we could shower. However, it was a big water butt situated in the corner of a very small room that we were both in and the water looked as dirty as the river we had just come from. Plus we had to use a bowl to pour it so it wasn't a shower as such. We gave it a miss and just dried and changed but it was funny in a way and showered when we got back to hotel later.Then we had a 3 hour drive back to Bangkok to end a great day.The next morning a DVD was delivered to our room from Nam containing hundreds of photos that she had taken of the day. We almost had every second of our water bath with the elephants captured as still images! And at no extra cost! Impressive service.I would recommend, excellent trip!"

They picked us up in a luxurious van and we made our way to the first stop (River Kwai) - Por ensured we got a good coffee at a stop (needed!) and provided rain coats and umbrellas as it was pouring down. She also provided some lovely food to eat before we arrived at the temple. Once there Por ensure we were clear on the process of feeding the Monks and had her camera at the ready to photograph our every move that day (such a great gesture). The Tiger Temple did not disappoint! It was simply a wonderful experience to not only see and engage with the tigers but to also hold them and feed them. We were lucky enough to cuddle a 3 week old cub. On this tour you get to do so much with the tigers and do not believe the stories you hear about the tigers being drugged. There is no way these little fiesty fellows were. My husband and I were very happy with the whole trip, in particular when Por left a CD of all the images of our wonderful experience at our Hotel Reception the next day.

They drafted a personalised itinerary and agreed to pick us up from our hotel in Bangkok at 4:30am.After picking us up our guide Tanya explained that in order to visit places when it was quietest, we should reorder our activities from what was originally discussed - fine by us. We got to the bridge on the River Kwai around 6am and were the first tourists there. We then went straight to Erawan Falls and again we were the first people into the park. This meant we could see each level without any other people around which was great. As we made our way down coach loads of Russian tourists began turning up so I'm really glad we made it there before the crowds. We then went on to Hellfire Pass, had some lunch, fed some wild monkeys, visited the death railway and bathed elephants in the river. Tanya made sure to explain everything as went along. We got back to our hotel at 7:30pm. Tanya made sure that we got the most of our day and although paying for a private tour was relatively expensive, I believe being able to do everything we wanted was worth it.

Our guide was Kent, who spoke great English and was very nice. Our driver was also very nice. We went to the Floating Market, Bridge Over the River Kwai, Tiger Temple, and bathing with elephants. All were great, but bathing with elephants was by far the best. It was tons of fun. You sit on an elephant with an elephant trainer right behind you and they take you into the water. For about 20-30 minutes you play with the elephants, they throw you around with their trunks, you jump off their heads, etc. And the elephants are really nice and responsive to the trainers. Also, a different Bangkok Day Tours guide (forgot her name) was already at the elephant camp before we arrived and offered to take pictures for us from her own camera while we were bathing with the elephants. Our own guide took video from our phones, but kind of screwed it up because he didn't really know how to work the phone. But the other guide was great and delivered the pictures to us at our hotel the next day on a CD. It was really nice of them and the pictures were great. Overall - an amazing day and definitely worth doing for a day trip in Bangkok."

            "review": "Extraordinary animal experience - elephants and tigers!. My wife scheduled me for a special weekend of \"adventure training\" with Bangkok Day Tours and it was fabulous. I flew from Washington DC, arriving on Friday night and returned to DC on Monday. On Saturday, I did the Extraordinary Elephant Day Trip (also listed as a separate entry in Trip Advisor); on Sunday, I did the Tiger Temple. Both of these allow up close and personal contact with the animals that involves some risk to the visitor but will always be memorable if you survive it! The elephant trip included a brief tour of the floating market and an unremarkable lunch but then an amazing experience with the elephants including riding like a mahout on the elephant's neck; riding an elephant into the water and then being tossed, submerged, and showered; feeding the elephants while we rode; and feeding the baby elephants. There was also an elephant show. I was the only one with Bangkok Day Tours and was able to spend several hours just with the elephants. The Tiger Temple tour started with an early morning stop at the infamous bridge over the Kwai River and an up close sighting of a large monitor lizard, presumably a Komodo Dragon, that swam up to me on the shore before dashing away. At the temple everyone lined up to provide food to the monks which we later shared with them for breakfast. We then experienced a remarkable sequence of activities including, playing with baby and yearling tigers in the temple, walking the older (2+ yr) tigers, bathing the tigers, feeding chicken to the tigers, playing with larger tigers with lures on the end of long bamboo rods (my tiger finally got the basketball and absolutely demolished it in his jaws), and watching a demonstration of the superb leaping power of the large tigers into a small pond. The tour ended with a late lunch at a good Thai buffet at a floating restaurant next to the bridge on the Kwai. My tour guides, Por and Sally, were excellent and provided running commentary about the sugar cane and teak we were passing on the road, discussion about the many temples, and lots of Thai history and culture. My driver on both days, Tong, picked me up and returned me to the JW Marriott and was a masterful driver in traffic that would be a challenge even to a Bostonian. He also made sure I was provided with endless snacks, from a bunch of small Thai bananas to sandwiches and roasted ears of sweet corn, and made sure I was well hydrated. The cost of these all included tours was very reasonable; it was a great experience and these were unique opportunities especially for a zoologist! I would use these Bangkok Day Tours again and will return with my wife for some tamer temple and palace tours."

I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about booking online with a company I had never dealt with before, but I had read reviews on Trip Adviser beforehand, so I felt more comfortable about it. On the day, our driver (La) turned up at our hotel on time and introduced himself to us. He asked us to waited outside the hotel door whilst he fetched our transport. We had a luxury van all to ourselves (leather reclining seats, air con and DVD player-the works!). He explained that we had to travel quite a long way and to relax. We were provided with ice cold water and snacks along the way. Our first stop was the floating market where we were introduced to Por, who took photos with my camera and her own. After this we went to the bridge over the river Kwai, picking up our tour guide Na, She was really chatty, spoke really good English and was very knowledgeable. We had lunch at the floating restaurant which was very nice. Then we went on to the highlight of the day which was elephant trekking and bathing with the elephants. Na took my camera and my friend's video camera and ran around taking photos and videos of our jungle trek. She wore me out watching her! Then we swapped elephants and went into the river to play. We all had a brilliant time, again the crew taking the video and Na with my camera and Por reappeared with her camera snapping away like a demon! The next day a package arrived for me and when we returned home, we had over 1500 pictures which were complimentary (Ok, some of which were on my own camera, but Por had taken over 800 pictures of us bathing with the elephants-how many companies would do that for free?). Then we fed the baby elephants with bananas provided by Na (again, free). It was a long day and we were driven back to our hotel by La, who had driven over 400km's during the day. All in all we had an experience that we will never forget and I would not hesitate in recommending Bangkok Day tours to anyone!"

In addition, 2 other groups booked the same tour that day, so an additional photographer, Por, joined us and took pictures of everyone (for free). We got over 1500 pics, 800 of which were from Por, who delivered them on a disc the next day to our hotel in Bangkok. We took two cameras, which worked out great. The driver picked us up on time and they always had enough food and water for us. I spoke to another couple on the same tour and they said the paid $600 each for this tour. My husband and I paid about $650 for the two of us together. I don't know if the couple booked through a travel agent, but it sounds like you should book directly through Bangkok Day tours to get the best price. Just go to their website, and fill out the booking form. We paid in advance with our credit card, so it was very easy.I have read mixed reviews on the Tiger Temple, but I thought it was wonderful. We did the morning tour, so we got a ton of interaction with the tigers and saw the them awake, happy, and playful. The staff was also very friendly. There were only 16 people there the day we went, so everyone seemed to have a tiger to cuddle with. The elephant bathing was also amazing. I will say, that you should not expect clear, clean water like I have been reading about in other reviews. The river was very muddy where we were, and right before my elephant stepped into the water, my husband's elephant pooped in the water right in front of us... a lot. I waited until I stopped seeing floaters before I would get off the elephant and into the the water. Yes it was gross, but totally worth it! The nice thing was that they waited until we were the only ones in the water before they started our program. So the pictures turned out great... with only us and not a lot of other people in the background. Thank you Na and Por for a wonderful day!"

Not just a walk round a track, but much more. We went on a circuit through the jungle and then from there we then changed and had an elephant each along with the Mahout and took them down to the River Kwai. For the next 40 mins we had a great time in the water, just us! A memorable time and as Anda had promised, we were very happy. Anda also doubled up as the photographer and took some great photo's.

This tour includes three of the most unusual Buddhist temples in Bangkok: Wat Trimitr with its invaluable Golden Buddha (5 1/2 tons of solid gold). Wat Po, the most extensive temple in Bangkok, with its colossal Reclining Buddha and the Chedis of the Kings, and the striking white marble structure of Wat Benchamabophit.The Grand Palace was the seat not only of the king and his court, but contained within its crenellated walls, the entire government administration. The architecture is vibrantly Thai though there are some European designs as well. Brilliantly colored and gilded, and decorated with intricate detail, the overall effect is dazzling. The palace served as the official residence of the kings of Thailand from the 18th to the mid-20th century.The most famous building on the palace grounds is Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha), regarded as the most sacred Buddhist temple (wat) in Thailand. Construction of the temple began when King Rama I moved the capital from Thonburi to Bangkok in 1785. Unlike other Thai temples, it does not contain living quarters for monks; rather, it has only the richly decorated holy buildings, statues, and pagodas.The main temple building is the central ubosoth, which houses the Emerald Buddha. Though green in color, the Buddha is actually carved from a single piece of jade, and though only 17 inches tall, is the most revered object in Thailand. Also within the grounds are several palaces, used for various occasions: the Funeral Palace, Reception Palace, Throne Hall, Coronation Hall, and the Royal Guest House. The majority of halls and palaces can be viewed from outside only, but the exteriors are captivating enough to please."

We could not fault the organisation and friendliness of them both and they were so informative about any question we asked. Por knows all the tricks about getting the best out of the day and it was like she was on the tour with us as one of our friends. Her hearty laugh and smile just makes you want to hug her. The Bridge over Kwai was very moving and we had the opportunity to see one of four trains a day pass us on the bridge. The tiger temple was peaceful and well organised by the monks and volunteers. Got a few little nips by the babies but only because they were playful. I'm not one for elephant rides as I think they are out of their environment but after it was explained they had been rescued and really well treated by their handlers I appreciated how the Thai people have this bond with them and love them as family. It was an extremely memorable day and it was all down to the friendly and passionate approach of Por and Joe (an unbelievable confident driver in sometimes mayhem traffic). The 4.30am pick up is the way to go as you beat all the 'day tourists' and you experience the peace of the Thai countryside. Our photos and video delivered to us the next day are a tribute to Por's professional photography skills. Will highly recommend this company and will never forget our wonderful guides.

            "review": "Amazing, totally must do day - tiger temple breakfast. We heard about the tiger temple whilst touring Vietnam and booked this last minute and WOW it was so amazing. The 4:30 am pick up is hard work but the mini van has large comfy seats that recline fully and you have it to yourselves so you can get some sleep on the way. I saw that someone said they didn't get a guide - this is not true - we picked up the local guide about 20 minutes before getting to the Bridge over the River Kwai. Tossapon was fabulous, she knew all the history, all the best positions to get really great photo's and brought breakfast to eat in the van so that we wouldn't waste time eating when we could be playing with tigers. It's a gentle start walking across the bridge and then you're off to the main event. Fortunately I had a spare memory card with me as Tossapon (and I think other guides do this too) brought a second camera and so during the visit there are pictures being taken from every angle and videos too. Again she was amazing as a guide as she positioned us to get the maximum time interacting and advised us how to handle the youngsters so they relaxed and simply fell asleep in our arms once they had been fed and had a little play. The whole experience is truly fabulous, tigers of every age and if you think they are drugged (as some posts imply) I cannot see how, the large tiger who is clearly well trained for the head on your lap photo was up chasing toys 5 minutes later and jumping into the water area and they were jumping up and playing with us in the water too. All the animals we saw were in excellent condition, lovely coats and bright eyes and the staff and monks seemed to know each one individually and were always watchful of tourists but also encouraged interaction under their guidance. I have maybe 1500 photographs from the day plus video's and most are from the tiger temple. After you have followed the morning programme (I think well worth for the interaction with the small tigers and the bathing) you head over to ride an elephant (we didn't wash them) this is still a brilliant experience and again they are in nice condition and the location is very picturesque (for me the tigers overshadowed it a little). After the ride you go to a pleasant restaurant for lunch which is a set menu, the food was very good and the restaurant was certainly popular. You can then snooze for the 3 hour ride back to Bangkok. The service and guides were top quality and the whole package magical."

Bangkok - The city of Life, true to it's tag it is a city of life every one who visit the city will agree that.Few years back I had a different 'dark' opinion on Bangkok, mainly because of its night life and pub culture, but over the years I saw it transforming with the changing world, The city managed to cope with rapid globalization, In the begging it was only a tourist destination and tourism was the main source of revenue for Thai People and government, but now things are changing the city has become a hub to many MNCs of various sectors around the world. Providing better employment for locals, this in my opinion reduced dependency on tourism industry and people depending on this, resulting better hospitable conditions for tourists and healthy competition among the locals. My observations in comparison with other major cities of ASIA.(Beijing, Shanghai, Delhi, Mumbai,Chennai,Hyderabad, KL, Singapore,Taipei, Seoul, Manila) Transportation :Bangkok got organized transport system, Sky Train - MRT, Good roads and better road decency compared to above cities, heavy traffic though but vehicles don't over cross each other creating grids, mainly no one horn the vehicles even there is a rush. As an Asian I prefer to live and work here. Less pollution. River taxis are unique and better way to go places. People: People are decent but their decency varies based on their profession, You will experience pure hospitality in a Hotel and same (some) time it will be a nightmare with a tuk-tuk or a regular other guy in a shop or a pub. It all depends on once capability of handling things. Cost of living :Bangkok is relatively cheap, but you have to look at the right place. You can find food ranging from 25TB to 2500TB, same for hotel and accommodation.City is know for its best bargains, but things are changing most of the shops and malls these days are tend to go for a fixed price concept.  Over all for visitors:Bangkok is a place to chill and relax with exotic food-drinks and Thai Massage, For visitors who prefer site seeing & temples its a one time visit."

The elephants were gentle and playful. i was doing bombs of the back of the elephant, grabbing its trunk and squirting others and generally having a great time. i looked across and saw the british girls who had abandoned all hope of keeping their hair dry and were in fits of rapturous laughter. i had such a good time i slept all the way back to Bangkok. i left some things in the van and the Bangkok Day Tours staff dropped it off to my hotel the next day. wonderful lifetime memory created"

From there we went to the Tiger Temple where we were privileged to serve breakfast to the monks before getting all involved with the tigers - we fed the young ones from bottles, took them on walks, exercised and played with them, bathed them, walked the adult tigers down into the canyon for their water activity time, and took PHOTOS, PHOTOS, and more PHOTOS. My concern prior to booking this tour was that all the Tiger Temple photos made the adult tigers look drugged for photos with visiting tourists and I wanted no part in an experience that involved any mistreatment of these animals to serve our purposes. Well, having had this time all morning with the tigers, I can assure that the tigers in the photos are not drugged nor mistreated! These staff members care for these animals with all the love they have for them. The tigers may be tired from their morning water play and the heat, but they are not drugged. We took our photos right after their play and as witnesses, we know they weren't. One more addition is there were even a couple of two-week old tigers at the temple which we were only able to photograph due to their very young age.As if that weren't enough, we then went on to one of the elephant camps where we again bottle-fed the babies, rode the elephants bareback (not in a basket!) through the jungle, and then bathed them in the River Kwai. How many people can seriously say they've ever had the opportunity to have such an experience?!? The elephants lifted us on their trunks; we had water fights using their water-filled trunks as hoses, and just had great fun! I can't say enough about this whole day, this entire experience! Everyone with Bangkok Day Tours was terrific - from Caroline who booked the tour and took care of all the details beforehand to Po and our other guide as well! They took photos and videos all day and delivered a CD to each of us at our hotels the next day so we'd all have copies of everything! How's that for awesome customer service?!? I would recommend Bangkok Day Tours in a heartbeat and I'd encourage anyone even considering the possibility of this tour to spend the extra money for the FULL experience .... you won't regret it!!!"

The online booking was easy, safe and secure. My driver Po (silent P) and tour guide Anda (not panda) were great. The overall day was nothing less than fantastic. I was on my own and put full trust in these people and they proved it very well. The cost was worth every penny, with lunch, cold water and a snack provided after the elephant ride, be sure to take extra money for tipping the mahout (100 baht min). I will definitely be back to do the tiger temple.Regards."

I booked three different tours over three days.When I turned up I expected to be part of a small group but, in the event, I was the only person on the tour. I was assigned a tour guide, Kent, for all three days, a brand new Toyota Landcruiser for one day and a comfortable minibus for the other two. A lot of tour companies would have found a way to cancel or 'persuade' me onto another tour but, to their credit BDK went ahead.Kent provided more than enough information to explain where we were going and what we were going to see. To be fair this wasn't particularly in depth but it was sufficient. The logistics of the tours were perfect and, as mentioned in other reviews, the company pre-empts requirements with cold towels, drinks etc. Lunches were good, especially on the last day when the usual buffet was replaced by a choice from a menu.These tours are not cheap. In fact they cost more than one might expect to pay in Thailand but I cannot fault the service and I would thoroughly recommend the company."

What we loved about it was that we didn't have to ask or look for it, it was pre-empted which shows good customer service. We did the tiger temple with the monks in the morning, and there is no way that these tigers are drugged. They played like domestic cats & dogs and it was a joy to see them up close & personal. The Elephants were a highlight of the trip & bathing with them in the river is an experience we will never forget. I have no hesitation in booking through them again if we were in Bangkok."

All their tours are private so it's literally all for your group/party. Sally was great! She had brought some snacks for us. First off, we had a 2 hour drive to the Bridge over River Kwai. Took some pictures and walked a bit before driving another 30 minutes to the Tiger Temple in Kanchanaburi. Before entering, we had to present breakfast offerings to the Monks (which was also provided by Bangkok Day Tours). First thing we did was play with the Tiger Cubs. The younger cubs were as big as your regular full grown pet cats at home. The older cubs were pretty much the size of a medium-large sized dog. After playing a bit, we had breakfast. Tried some new fruits like Mangosteen and Rambutans.Next up we washed and shampooed the Tiger cubs before feeding them some chicken. After, we walked the bigger tiger cubs through the Canyon. At this point, we were given large dangling toys to actually \"play\" with the cubs. (Sort of like the dangling toys you have for your cats at home...but a BIGGER and noisier!). There were consistently a bunch of tiger handlers to accompany you. Watching the Tigers chase the toys and chase each other was exhilarating! They're so fast!After, we took turns walking a full grown tiger and had the opportunity to take a picture with a full grown tiger's head in our laps! After everyone got a chance, we were told to stand in a fenced area where we could watch the handlers play with the full grown tigers. Got a chance to watch the full growns duke it out with each other.Once that was complete, our next destination was to the Elephant rides. Had a great opportunity to exchange seats with the elephant handler and actually sit on the elephant's neck and lead the way!After the ride, we had lunch at a local Thai restaurant before our 3-4 hour trek back to our hotel in Bangkok.Overall, it was a GREAT trip and Sally was an amazing tour guide! She was very informative, warm, and loves what she does! She also helped us take hundreds of photos on our camera and hers as well! Had a blast and would definitely recommend others to the same trip!"

His smooth driving allowed us all to sleep comfortably in the reclining chairs. On route we later picked up our guide, Na, who was so informative and organised. Na explained how we would get the best and most pictures, what exactly we should do when meeting the monks and how to get the best experience with the tigers ( choose to go with the big cats ) and elephants ( we rode the elephants bare back instead of choosing the baskets ). Na stopped off to get us memory stick allowing us to use her camera, provided snacks, fruit and water. Lunch ( included ) was gorgeous and timed perfectly during our trip. Through out the day she shadowed our party and got the most amazing photos, not missing a single thing, she was amazing. This lovely kind lady made our day and provided the best record of our memories and made sure we got the best experience ever."

The company confirmed our pick up the night before and were politely waiting for us as we met in the hotel lobby at 4:30 AM. The tour guide and driver were wonderful and helpful (even patient enough to drop by an ATM to finalize payment). We had the high tech van to ourselves along the long morning drive, which was amazing.Our first stop was a photo opportunity at the bridge at the river Kwai. We then drove to the tiger temple and it was better than expected - both in terms of access to the animals but in terms of everything we saw during the day. The elephant camp wasn't quite as nice, largely because the \"ride\" was essentially just around the property without any real direction (we spent more time as the mahouts let the elephants eat around 200 yards from the camp). Luckily the time with the elephants in the water was fun and helped recover the experience. I originally had been a bit nervous about seeing any animal cruelty with the elephants but other than a few minor markings from the mahout's tool, the largely used voice and hand control to guide the elephants.The lunch they had arranged was quite nice and then the ride home was restful. The driver allowed us to show our pictures on the van's flat screen in addition to watching a movie. Also, the driver and guide were open to dropping us off at the first train station to help save the drive time at rush hour to the hotel (probably saving at least an hour or more). Again, this was a first rate organized trip and the service provided by our guide and driver was worth the higher than average cost."

The boat was just for us and the cruise was fun . As we cruised we saw the Wat Arun which is another temple on the shore. We were given bread to feed the Fish in the river on the temple banks . So many Fish in the river which were huge . They were cat fish . Our Tour guide had got for us\" Thai Dessert after lunch to be eaten after we reached the shores . That was real sweet of her . This was Thai mangoes with sticky rice and the sweetened coconut milk . That brought us to Pak Klong Talad ( the flower and Fruit market ) . This was so good. The flowers Like orchids in different colors were so welcoming and beautiful to see. My guide was so gracious to buy me a bunch of the lovely dark magenta Orchids . I loved it. Then saw the fruits and veg of different kinds , all so neatly assembled for sale . After that we went to Wat PHo another temple -The recling Buddha temple.

We had a really early pick up - 4:30am at our hotel! This was more than worth it, however, for the morning we had! Even though it was just myself and my boyfriend, we were picked up in a VIP mini-van, with fully reclining seats. These were very useful, as we started with a 2.5 hour drive to the bridge over the River Kwai. We arrived there just as the sun was rising, and it was really interesting to hear the history of the place and see the beautiful river flowing in the morning light. Our next stop was the Tiger Temple. Our tour guide, Sally, was absolutely amazing and clearly enjoys her job. She helped us prepare some food donations which we then gave to the monks as they passed by in a procession. We then went up to the temple (ladies, make sure you're dressed appropriately) and got to bottle feed a tiger cub straight away! We had over an hour playing with the cubs, some of which were only 3 weeks old! It was an amazing experience, and the staff were all helpful and friendly, and clearly knew how to handle the cubs. We then got to walk a cub on a lead, wash an older cub, feed it and play with them in their enclosure. After that, we got to walk a fully grown adult tiger - this was a little scary, but an experience!! We had our pictures taken with an adult tiger and then watched the adult males play and fight in the water. This was truly an amazing morning! There are native English-speaking staff there too, so everything is very clearly explained as you go. We then went to our elephant trek. This was the only disappointing part of the trip, as our 'trek' was more a 30 minute stroll through the car park and areas surrounding the mahout's huts - not through jungle at all. All in all, Bangkok Day Tours were a brilliant company - professional and friendly at the same time. Sally wanted to get to know us, and was constantly taking photos for us! Little touches, like a cold can of Coke when we had finished at the temple, were great too! I would definitely suggest using this company for the Tiger Temple tour, but perhaps give the elephants a miss. You can visit the temple in the afternoons, but it doesn't give you as much hands-on time with the tigers as the morning program does."

The first was the \"Extraordinary Elephant\" tour, while the second was the \"Tiger Temple\" tour. First--the booking process was extremely simple, and I received confirmations right away. The person managing the emails was responsive and easy to work with. I was extremely impressed. Our first tour, the Elephant day tour, was excellent. Our guide was right on time, and our driver was efficient and safe. The van was air-conditioned, and fully stocked with movies, water, and snacks for us. We really couldn't have asked for more. We went first to the Floating Market, which was a great experience. Our guide taught us how to effectively bargain, and had lots of tidbits for us about the market. We then went to the River Kwai, where we enjoyed an excellent lunch. Again, our guide couldn't have been more helpful. At this point, she realized that we had accidentally signed up again for the River Kwai tour the next day, and she took the time to call her office, and have them ensure that we didn't repeat the trip. We were so pleased--she really went out of her way for us! We then went to the elephant camp, which was incredible. Just an amazing experience, and our guide made sure to take plenty of pictures, which was much appreciated. This was honestly the best planned and most efficiently executed tour I've ever been on. Our guide could not have been better. The next day, we had a different guide for the Tiger Temple tour, but she was just as effective. Again, the van was fully stocked and the driver was great. Before the tiger temple, we went to the cementary, a famous cave, and to lunch, which were all fantastic. At the temple, our guide was very effective in showing us around, taking photos, etc. The temple has less for the guide to do (since the staff does a lot there), but we were still very pleased with our guide. Even more impressive: after the tour, our guide took the time out of her night to show us where Asiatique (the riverfront), and to help us find a great Thai restaurant (where she ordered in Thai for us to make sure we got what we wanted). She literally rode the BTS over with us and everything...we couldn't believe that she was so willing to go above and beyond to help us. Overall, I would recommend Bangkok Day Tours to anyone. We couldn't have been happier with the two tours. This is a five-star company, and the tours are worth every penny."

Our first trip to Thailand and booking the tiger temple tour with Bangkok day tours was based on trip advisor reviews - no need to be nervous - Por and Joe gave us an unforgettable experience. The trip itself was fantastic but made 10 times better by the way these two wonderful people looked after us Por even purchased some medication for my daughters nasty mosquito bites suffered in Bangkok - it worked wonders! - If you want the trip of a lifetime book with these guys and if you want great photos to remember it by ask for Por she was incredible with the camera and gave us over 600 photos to take home - thanks guys - unforgettable."

Na was very knowledgeable about the history and background details of our tour, telling us about vegetarion as we drove past and explaining everything to us. Funny, cool, informative; she became a friend. The bus made us feel like VIP's, all leather with reclining chairs and TVs on which we could watch a video and photos Na and Joe took as we rode and swam with elephants during the tour. So awesome. Insanely great value. I just cant say enough good things about this trip. We all feel very fortunate to have had such an experience"

I got some amazing photos and had a great time. I would recommend the VIP morning program to anyone there was only 16 in total there so we each got reasonable time with the tigers unlike the afternoon program were its apparently a lot busier. At 12000baht its not cheap but definitely worth it."

The car picked me up promptly and I went first to the floating market, which is super touristy and most items have the special tourist price, but it was fascinating and I got some fantastic photos. Next Er drove to Konchonaburi, where I met my guide, Ricky, who was fabulous and really cares about showing his hometown. After a tour of the Konchonaburi War Cemetery, I visited the Bridge on the River Kwai and had lunch at the floating restaurant below, which was relaxing and peaceful. Finally, we headed off to the Tiger Temple--I highly recommend the cub feeding program! What a fascinating opportunity, assisted by both buddhist monks and volunteers at the temple from around the globe--i have a renewed appreciation for these gorgeous, but wild (although well-socialized) animals, and my zookeeper friend who worked with tigers at the National Zoo in Washington, DC is now considering going. What a rewarding experience! Five stars!"

            "review": "Tiger cubs, floating market and bridge- tour 1117. I highly reccomend Bangkok Day Tours. We just returned from an amazing journey with Na and Jo. They were early but not rushed and we departed in a plush van with DVD, surround sound, and disco lights which of course thrilled my children. Through our entire trip, Na cheerfully showed us local sites and answered all of our questions. Our first stop was the floating market. Na showed us around and got us on our way in a boat. She showed us local fruits and foods and helped us negotiate prices on items of choice. Great lunch and history lesson at the bridge with plenty of time to walk across. Final stop was the Tigers, incredible! I have heard from some that they think the tigers are sedated, after seeing for myself I strongly disagree. The monks and caretakers know these animals, their mannerisms and routines. Awwwe is all I can say about the tiger cubs. We were allowed to play with them, and we're instructed to correct them with a light thump on the nose if they got rough. This is where their training truly begins. After play we fed them and most of the cubs fell asleep, prompting a lot of cuddles from the guests. Once again, Na kept everything organized and on time. She instructed us as to where to go and kept us first in line as to get the best experience possible. She even acted as photographer and got some great close up shots..Our driver, Jo , was fantastic. He was always waiting for us with a smile and got us to all destinations quickly and safely. He kept the kids entertained and always checked that we were comfortable and happy. A special stop was made for my older son. He mentioned that he would like to try sugar cane. They knew where to go and got him a full bag that was ready to eat, he was thrilled. I cannot say enough about this tour group, specifically Na and Jo, worth every penny!"

            "review": "Elephant bathing was the experience of a lifetime. Bangkok Day Tours elephant trip was worth every single penny (http://www.bangkokdaytours.com/tour.asp?tid=57). It was unbelievable. I can't think of any one experience in my life that felt more remarkable than bathing with the elephants. I would recommend it to anyone. I went with my mother who is 70 years old. She is pretty healthy and agile for her age, but I she didn't get as much out of the trip as I did because she was worried about her agility and, in particular, she was worried hips that wouldn't repair themselves should her agility fail her. The ride in the basket was bumpy and made her nervous about the bareback ride down to the river. I actually found riding bareback much more comfortable than riding in the basket, but she was too nervous and so she didn't ride an elephant down to the river with me. She walked down with our guides and watched me swim with the elephants from the shore. One of the mahouts had his elephant go over and squirt her, which was fun, and he brought his elephant to the shore to lay down and pose with her and be pet by her. In hindsight I realized that I probably should have asked if they would let mom just wade in and sit on an elephant in the water, gentle bathing. It seemed the mahouts encouraged them to buck and be playful, but without that encouragement, they would have been fine for mom. That is something to consider if you end up going with someone who is scared to ride the elephant down to the river. But, even though mom didn't get into the water with the elephants, she was absolutely delighted by the entire experience.The rest of the trip was top notch as well. It was a long ride from Bangkok (about 3 hours), but the van was really comfortable (and even equipped with DVD player and a light show!) and our driver Joe and tour guide Na were excellent company. The floating market was fun (but really touristy) and I enjoyed the buffet at the place they took us for lunch at the bridge over the river Kwai. Also, they were great cameramen and I got the best vacation pictures ever.Since mom and I are both adults, I indicated that we are traveling as \"friends\", rather than \"family\" because it looks like family implies either young children or teens."

            "review": "Tiger Temple morning session and Elephant ride/swim. Bangkok Day Tours were very helpful and organized in planning our tour. Every email was replied to, and all questions by phone were answered on the spot. Our group did the Breakfast with Monks/ Tiger morning session. We were picked up at 4:30 am from our hotel lobby, which is exactly the time we were advised. Our driver was Jo and he was very friendly. He introduced himself to us and made sure that we had everything for the trip before we even left. Jo reminded us to bring extra clothes for the swim with elephants. I should note now, the van Jo has is fully pimped out. Reclining seats, a flat screen tv, and aircon vents that made it seem like each seat had its own climate control. There were only 4 of us in a van that could seat 10, very spacious.We drove for about 2 hours, then we picked up our tour guide Na. She was also very friendly and was always smiling. One of the things we didnt expect was Jo and Na provided us snacks such as sandwiches, cookies, and cakes. This was a pleasant surprise as we didnt have time for breakfast at the hotel.Our first stop was the Bridge over the river Kwai. This stop was very short, really only for a photo opportunity. Na told us some history about the place and took us to the spots which were the best for photographs. We even had to move aside as a train rolled past. Plenty of photos taken and then we moved on to the tiger temple.The Tiger temple was simply amazing. We initially had to make our offerings to the monks. Na taught us exactly what we needed to do, how to Wai the monks properly and what we would do if we ran out of food to offer. Once this was done, we entered the Temple. We moved to the main building on the grounds where we were brought up to feed the tiger cubs. This part was pretty awesome as the cubs are are like your normal house cats. The staff and monks then had breakfast which you could join, but since we had food from Na and Jo, we decided to keep playing with the tigers. They had a range from cubs to very young tigers in this building and as the monks and staff were eating, we had a good 30 mins of alone time with the cubs and young tigers.After this, we walked the tigers back to their enclosures, unfortunately we couldnt get the big tiger, which wouldve been great, but we had a decent sized young tiger. Once at the enclosure, we were asked if we wanted to play with the big tigers or the small ones. Obviously we said the big ones, I would highly recommend this as you can get photos of the tigers jumping 4m in the air right in front of you. The whole group was put in the playing enclosure and you will be in there with a lot of tigers. Dont worry though as the staff are there with you and they know how to make the tigers jump. (They play like house cats, they like noise and movement). At no time did we ever feel we were in danger.Then we went to get our photo take with a BIG tiger on our lap, the tiger was very tame, didnt really move much but I wouldnt say they were drugged as after this photo op, the staff took these tigers to the water enclosure and some of the guys (aka Tiger Man) went swimming and playing with them (this is when they became very active). We even got a few roars from the tigers. After this part, the morning session ended, but it was well worth the money. I would also say to who ever says the tigers are drugged, you must have a look at the morning session. There is no way drugged up tigers and jump and move as fast and as high as these guys. That was one of the best experiences I have had. Na and Jo took us to lunch at this local Thai restaurant and we had some really good food, both spicy and tasty. One of the best meals we had while in Thailand..The second part of our tour was the elephant ride and swim. The elephant ride was a bit dull, we just really walked around a track, through some trees, not really seeing much and nothing really exciting other than riding an elephant. The excitement really started when we were told to get changed to our boardies and get ready for the swim.They gave us an elephant each and we rode on its neck all the way until the river. Once in the river, the mahout told my elephant to take some water and spray me with its trunk (I really should have know that when the elephant pointed its trunk at me). Then the fun began, my elephant dipped me in the water, I jumped off and got on its trunk. My mahout then got the elephant to raise me up with its trunk. The first time i did this, I didnt know what to expect and I went flying in the air behind the elephant. It was very good fun. Basically the mahouts take good care of you and show you the fun things to do while swimming with the elephants.After that it was back to Bangkok. The trip back is about 3 hours due to traffic, but Jo's car as I said in the beginning has a TV, and he even provided DVDs. So the three hour drive back home was basically 2 movies which we didnt notice at all.Overall the tours and the tour company (especially Na and Jo) were excellent. I would highly recommend these tours and Bangkok Day Tours any time. We always felt like VIPs and well looked after, and at no point did we feel unsafe. Really, how many times can you say you played with about 20 tigers (unchained) and swam with elephants?"

            "review": "Tiger Temple Breakfast and Elephant Bathing (Code1511). I cannot praise this tour enough, and i think our tour guide Na and driver of our car Mr Jo made the experience even more worth while.. they were absolutely terrific, ensuring we got to do everything we came to do on that day. During our time at the tiger temple you get to bottle feed the baby tiger cubs, well you get a baby tiger amoungst 4 people. Once they have been fed, everyone else goes off to have breakfast whilst the tiger cubs are left behind. Na was amazing, she gave us breakfast in the car on the way to the tiger temple so when we got there we had already eaten so we skipped the breakfast with everyone else and therefore got to play with the tiger cubs for longer, which meant we got to socialise and play with more then just one tiger cub, and we also at this time got cubs to ourselves which was just absolutely precious!!! Na had our camera this whole time and snapped so many amazing shots for us, telling us how to hold the baby tigers to get the best photos possible!!! After our time with the baby tigers we got to walk the tigers to the canyon where they have there 'play time'. Here we Bathed a year old tiger, got to hand feed it chicken and then we got to choose between playing with the one year old big tigers or playing with the tiger cubs again. We played with the one year old tigers as we had already had lots of time with the tiger cubs (again thanks to Na), which meant we got to have the best amount of time with the tigers of all ages... After also watching the adult tigers play in there pool, watching them jump off rocks and tackle each other we were off to the elephant camp. Here we did a half hour trek around the forest area which surrounded the camp!! It was great as the elepahnt trainer half way along the track gets off the elephant and lets you sit on the neck whilst the elephant walks and he takes photos of you!! they also make them pose with there trunks up etc which makes for some cute photos. Once we did the trek, Na made time for us to watch the elephant show. Here the elephants dance, massage people, paint paintings, spin hooler hoops and more entertaining things. My boyfriend dave really wanted to be massaged by the elephant so Na made sure that that happened, i also wanted to buy the painting the elephant had painted whilst we watched the show and Na also made sure that i was the one that bought it. Then for the best part of the entire tour, bathing with the elephants. I was with my boyfriend and another couple, we were the only ones doing the bathing and we each got our own elephant to swim with (also an elephant trainer per elephant). It was the most magical half an hour of my life, the elephants were ducking you under water whilst you sat on there necks, throwing us in the air with there trunks, letting us sit on there trunks, we were jumping off them, they were rolling around and it was just amazing. No words can do it justice!!! Na the whole time was taking pictures for us, making sure we all got some very awesome action shots, whilst Mr JO took our video camera and filmed the whole thing :) I cant express it enough, if you are going to bangkok and are keen to do the tiger temple and elephants, MAKE SURE THIS TOUR IS ON YOUR TO DO LIST. it was a little more expensive then other tours but without a doubt worth every cent, it was worth even more to me. A day in my life i will never forget thanks to bangkokdaytours, and made even more memorable by Na and Mr JO."

We stopped along the way to meet two reps from the company who handed us snacks, took the balance of money and left. Our guide met us in Kanchanaburi and while he was a nice enough guy - he spoke very little interest and didn't know an awful lot about the attractions. He seemed to be as much to help the driver find the places as he was to show us anything. We saw the bridge on the River Kwai, had a meal, saw elephants and tigers - all great attractions arranged by the tour company but their involvement pretty much stopped at getting us between locations.

He was a wonderful driver and we all reclined our seats and went to sleep, which made the two and a half hour trip pass very quickly!Just before our first stop at Kanchanaburi, we picked up our guide Ricky. We can't say enough positive things about Ricky! He was fantastic. He was very kind and thoughtful and made us feel right at home. He took the time to make sure that we understood all customs at the tiger temple and we had the best day possible.I would highly recommend the morning tour. The groups are small and you get a never to be repeated opportunity to spend time with the tigers. The baby tigers are absolutely delightful and it's wonderful seeing the staff interacting with the animals.It's very obvious that the staff have a strong bond with the tigers and it's clear that they are treated very well. I have read previous reports that the tigers are drugged and that's why they can be interacted with, but it's very obvious with the morning tour that they are not. They are very, very active during their exercise sessions. I think they just get worn out in the heat of the day.One word of advice however - this tour is only for those who are relatively fit and healthy. It would not be an appropriate tour for anyone with limited mobility. There is too much walking on uneven surfaces.Following our time at the tiger temple, we went elephant trekking and then had lunch at a lovely restaurant in Kanchanaburi. Bangkok Day Tours is a truly wonderful company to deal with. Ricky and our driver were so helpful. I can't say enough positive things about our day. Thank you Bangkok Day Tours!"

After reading reviews on this attraction before we left, i decided to book our tour through Bangkok Day Tours Co Ltd or http://www.bangkokdaytours.com If anyone wants to do the tiger temple, definitely recommend the morning tour\u2026. It is more expensive but only 40 tourists at the temple that day where in peak season they said the afternoon tour is up to 500-600 people. The morning tour you get to do breakfast with the monks, feed baby cubs (we fed ones that were 1 month old), walk tigers, wash tiger cubs, go in the water play area (kinda scary), and have photo with adult tiger. The afternoon tour you only get to do the photo with adult tiger and line up in a huge queue if its peak season. However i would definitely recommend this morning tour even though more expensive, and the time with them seems very rushed in each activity mainly to have your turn get a photo and next person to have their turn. The tigers were not drugged, very much awake and happy to play and it was such a hot day that i don't blame the tigers just wanting to sleep in the shade in the heat of the evening program. Our tour was through Bangkok Day tours and was the breakfast with the monks at tiger temple and elephant bathing http://www.bangkokdaytours.com. The company was great, we booked before we left home and they were very prompt with email replies. Our tour guides name was Por and she was amazing, she took over 300 photos for us at the tiger temple and elephants which we weren\u2019t expecting at no extra charge, so we gave her a nice tip. I am so grateful she took photos because the majority of our tiger temple photos got lost, not sure what happened but the temple workers take your camera a lot to take photos for you, we think maybe one of them accidently deleted ours because we didn\u2019t realise until we got back to the hotel. But our tour guide had a dvd waiting at our hotel for us with all the photos she took before we flew out the next day. It was a very long day, but well worth it and will be definately recommending this tour company and tour to our family and friends"

Well all three were great to see and do mostly because i had the best tour guide in Sally and driver in Tong. They made my sightseeing tour so good. Sally told me all about Bangkok and Thailand also how and when the Floating market started and that the bridge on the River Kawi was the second bridge to be built there after the first one was bomb during the World war 2. She also took so many great pictures of me on my tour. In the Market on the River Kawi and while i was riding the Elephant. It was a great way to start my day in Bangkok. Then on my second day I went to the Tiger Temple, which is a must do. I email Caroline who runs the tour company and asked her to have Sally and Tong be my guide and Driver for the Tiger tour. And she did that for me with know problem. And again Sally was so greayt at taken my cell phone and taking some great pictures of me with the Tigers it was such a great day with them. Oh and my driver Tong what a driver he is. I was born and raised in NYC and Tong drives like a NYC Cab driver lol all good. Anyway if you ever go to Bangkok make sure you book your tours with Bangkok day tours and ask for Sally as your tour guide and Tong as your driver you wont go wrong with them."

The trip was booked with Bangkok day tours.Yes the trip is expensive but in my opinion (if you like Tigers) worth every last Baht. My tour guide was a lady called Sally - I called her Super Sally because she was a fantastic tour guide. Very good English and very knowledgeable about the Tiger Temple and surrounding areas. A prompt pick-up at 4-30am set the day. The Luxury 5-seat mini bus, including cold bottled water and nibbles was superb. Reclining leather seats in air conditioned comfort made it easy to nap during the journey. Unfortunately my digital camera was of the old variety. Sally had a modern high-speed digital camera and suggested I put my Flash card into her camera - magic. It is worth mentioning that some of the Tiger action is \"fast and furious\" (BUT VERY SAFE) when the cats get into the water. So a fast action camera will help capture the action as it happens. Sally became my personal photographer - brilliant. Yes you do get \"up close and personal\" with Tigers aged from 9 days to about 3yrs old. However, the more people on the tour the less time you get to yourself with the Tigers. This is no fault of my tour organisers. There are a number of companies who do this trip. I saw no evidence of cruelty towards the Tigers. I DO NOT believe they are drugged as has been suggested. They are far too active when they are in the water - and their body temperature lowers. The inter-reaction between the head keeper (An Ozzie from QLD) and the cats is unbelievable. The Tigers just play like domestic cats - chasing, leaping after toys - incredible to see. The lunch on my trip was on the floating restaurant on the River Kwai - next to the famous bridge at Kanchanaburi. The food offered consisted of European and Thai dishes and was first class. Also worth a mention is the Leopard which can be found between the bridge and the war museum. A small shopping complex - you can have your photo taken feeding the Leopard for 100Baht. After lunch I went Elephant washing. Brilliant fun. A scrubbing brush is provided and a great water fight with the Elephant is guaranteed. Again Super Sally took the photos for me. For me I would give my trip 12/10. I hope you get as much enjoyment from your, Tiger Temple - Monks Breakfast as I did. Cheers for now C :-))"

            "review": "Tiger Temple Breakfast Experience. What a great place to visit if you love tigers! If you truly want to get the most out of this experience you should do the morning breakfast program which starts around 7am-10am. Why? Because of all the interaction you get with the tigers. Cost 5000THB per person (as of November 2nd 2012). There are tour companies that go to the temple as well as other locations like what we did http://bangkokdaytours.com/tour.asp?tid=82The day begins by giving offerings to the Monks before you are allowed to enter the temple. Once inside we were able to feed baby tiger cubs ranging from 2 week old to 9 month old cubs. At all times you are with a tiger handler who use your camera to take the photos. They instruct you were to stand and what to do. I never felt un safe because of the people i was surrounded by. The great thing is there would have been ~20 tourists in the morning program so not too many other people so you never feel crowded.Next the Monks pray before everyone eats breakfast. After breakfast in small groups you help walk the tigers down to the bathing area where you give them a bath and feed them boil chicken. After they are washed its time to play by using big sticks with toys attached to the end the idea is to get the tigers to jump. The final part of the morning involves walking an adult tiger down to the tiger canon. We were given the opportunity to have a photo with a big adult before they were let loose and we observed from behind a barrier them playing with a tiger handler. The tigers are very lively and you can truly appreciate and understand what a powerful and majestic animal they are. If you really love tigers this is definitely worth the early morning to see them in a way you probably will never get to experience any where else. 5 stars. One thing i can tick of my bucket list :D Plenty of photos from others- mine look the same but gives you a great idea of what to expect."

They had water available and we headed towards the tiger temple as we Organised the morning tour \"breakfast with monks\" we stopped at the river Kwai bridge and it was a gorgeous sunrise and because it was early it was empty so we got some gorgeous shots... Then we headed to the temple we were offered breakfast croissants in the van as Sally explained it would be quite busy at the temple and we may not get much.. So this was generous.. We arrived at the tiger temple and the guides Organised the food offerings for the monks so we completed this ceremony, then we had a chance to bottle feed an play with the youngest cubs. After this we washed and played with some older ones. At the end we had photo opportunity with the full grown tigers and watched them play in the water.. It was a full on 3 hours with non stop tiger activity.. Sally took heaps of great photos and was super sweet.. We went to the elephant village after the temple and went for the ride in the jungle/forest.. We had a really busy day but it was really fun and ill never have an opportunity to get that close to a tiger again.. Thankyou to tong for driving safely and getting us there and back in comfort. A big Thankyou to Sally who was knowledgable on all our questions an was a really great tour guide..."

We were picked up at 4AM in a beautiful leather seated, air conditioned people carrier which we had all to ourselves! Water and croissants were provided and we set off to pick our tour guide up. She was AMAZING, she knew the area and took full control of everything from talking to people to having full control of our camera (she took some fantastic shots). Next stop was the Tiger Temple, again our dynamic guide rushed us to the front of every line and literally dragged us to the front of some so that we were certain to get the best pictures and first go at anything offered. On to an elephant trek where once again we didn't need to lift a single muscle as the dynamo had got us the best of everything and also the first of everything. Unfortunately her name escapes me but she was a young lady who we picked up and dropped off around 2 hrs from Bangkok. She went so far above anything that we expected and really did make, what would have been a fantastic day already, a truly amazing experience. Thank you so much . Roy and Emma"

This is another place to see if you have the time to spare, it is about 90 mins away from Bangkok, and whilst it is classed as a local market, it is also geared up for tourists, when you get there it is basically a market selling local + tourist produces on each side of the river, and down some back alleys. Whilst you are walking amongst the stalls you see the long tail boats coming + going, and I think a small ferry boat going across the river, but just as it is getting dark you get on your designated boat (ours had a total of 11 persons which included the chap that actually steered the boat), and for around an hour or so you are taken around looking at the fireflies hovering in the trees, and bearing in mind by this time you are in complete darkness on the river, although other boats are all around you, it is quite impressive. The total cost for 2 persons was 2600 baht, and glad I went"

Por took heaps of photos for us so we could capture every wonderful moment, ensuring that our fantastic memories were captured and at no extra cost. Por ensured that we had the best experience and was more than happy to provide an excellent service.Por was so kind and generous; in the morning I had a bad cough, without asking Por stopped and brought cough medicane without asking for any money; my cough stopped instantly. Por also stopped and brought us coffee and snacks along the way, catering for our every need. Everything about this tour was wonderful from the beginning to the end, the driver we were provided was also fantastic, both Por and the driver made us feel so comfortable and ensured we enjoyed and ourselves and made it a fantastic experience. The transport provided was so lovely and comfortable.The breakfast with the monks was unbelievable and as for the Tigers, what an experience. We got to feed, bath, walk and play with the Tigers, the Tigers were well looked after; they were so gentle and playful.

It was simply fantastic and a once in a lifetime experience. Pay the extra money and get up early and do this tour, not the standard tour later in the day. This one is when you get up close and personal and play and bath the tigers and you can see that they are not sedated as alleged by some. They are just tired from playing all morning with the behind the scenes tourists by the time the normal tourists get there.One tip though, don't make this trip on your last day in Thailand as we did and get dropped straight back to the airport to catch a flight to KL. We stank like nothing you have ever smelt before when we hopped on the packed Air Asia plane and we could see the other people on the plane physically cringing at the smell of us.

            "review": "Amazing Bangkok. While writing this travelog on Bangkok, the fact that many of my readers must have visited this place not once but many times, made my job much tougher. What differentiators can I introduce to my readers and moreover this was an official trip wherein time management was key for the sight seeing plans. Before I allowed that thought to overpower my brain, I made up my mind to write about this amazing tourist destination called Bangkok, the City of Angels or Krung Thep as this city is known locally.I reached Bangkok at 5:30am and the airport, which always gives the tourist a first glimpse of the city did not disappoint me. Since I had a business visa, the immigration was a breeze and it took me hardly 15 minutes to clear the process and come out of the airport. The Suvarnabhoomi Airport can be compared to any top international airport of today. What also struck me is the name of the airport (meaning Golden Earth in Sanskrit), roads and places that sounded Indian. Thailand had strong roots with medieval India much before Buddhism prevailed in this land. The airport terminal opens up to a large statue of Amrit manthan (churning of the ocean) as depicted in our Dasha Avatar. Tourists cannot miss this gigantic statue before they move on to the respective gates. I had asked Poonsuk, the taxi driver to pick me up from the Airport. Poonsuk nicknamed \u201cFunsuk Wangdu\u201d by me, was referred by a friend in India especially since he spoke good English. In Thailand, the local populace hardly speak good English. One has to use hand gestures or use calculators to communicate especially in the local markets or even in the Malls. Poonsuk played latest Bollywood chartbusters while on my way to the Hotel. I could see very few people on the road and asked Punsuk about it. He laughed saying Bangkok wakes up at night while people sleep in the mornings. Bangkok roads are notorious for the worst traffic jams in this part of the world. However the early morning ride was extremely smooth and it took us just 30 mins to cover a distance of 20 miles, whereas the same journey takes not less than 75 minutes during normal traffic hours. On the way, I was very impressed with the infrastructure especially the roads considering Thailand is still a developing country coupled with political turmoil at regular intervals. The country is ruled by the 86 year old monarch, who also happens to be the world's longest reigning head of state. The current Prime Minister, Yingluck Shinawatra exiled her borther Thaksin before taking over the premiership. She is the youngest Premier at 44 and looks more like a model than a Premier. Thai citizens actively follow politics and have a strong opinion on the leadership. Incidentally the Yellow shirt movement started during my trip but the Thai Police never allowed such a movement to affect traffic or tourist activities. This shows how much importance this country gives to tourism since it earns them the highest revenue percentage in terms of GDP. The weather at Bangkok was very balmy, humid and not too comfortable especially after you step out of the air conditioned hotel or mall. Maybe May-June is not the right time to visit thanks to the south west monsoon and high humidity. But that did not seem to deter the high inflow of tourists to Bangkok especially from India, perhaps used to this type of weather. The flights were full, the airport, streets and shopping malls were choc a bloc with tourists from all over the world especially Indians. Lady Gaga had visited Bangkok a few days before I reached there and seems the Bangkok crowd went gaga over the Lady. During my trip another world renowned celebrity, Aung San Suu Kyi visited Bangkok to attend the World Economic Forum. She made headlines on all 3 days she was at Bangkok, who is passionately called Mother Suu Kyi especially by the Burmese migrants in Thailand.The country once called Siam with a pseudo name \u201cLand of the White Elephant\u201d is today the fastest growing economy in the ASEAN region with heavy focus on the tourism industry. The male-female sex ratio is about 0.98 with a high literacy rate. The Thai Baht currency is strong against the Indian rupee (1 Thai Baht is equal to Indian Rupees 1.8). I was told that the buses running in Bangkok are free for general public and even the tourists. They were not luxurious but seemed comfortable to ride, atleast from the outside. The Sky Train is the most popular mode of transport in Bangkok and can be relied upon to reach a destination on time. The crazy road traffic at Bangkok can always play a spoilsport to your well designed plans. Sky trains are cheap (Thai Baht 15 for shortest destination), quick and convenient. The Tuk Tuks (akin to the auto rickshaws in India) are also popular among tourists but the fare needs to ne negotiated well before you take the ride. The glitzy shopping malls are a good place to shop for clothes and electronics especially the Indra Market and MBK. However most of them close after 9pm and if you still wish to shop till late night, you can look for night bazaars around MBK Mall open till dawn. Food is not a problem for Indians. There are lot of Indian restaurants but I preferred to taste the local Thai food which is now the rage in India. The MBK mall offers Global cuisine at very reasonable rates and I strongly recommend this place. For the adventurous ones, Bangkok streets offer roasted cockroaches, locusts, crickets and other insects. I also sighted mangoes and litchis being sold in the market but I was drawn towards a fruit called \u201cRambutan\u201d which is covered by a thick red thorny skin but very sweet inside.My stay at Four Seasons was extremely memorable. Please refer to my Tripadvisor contribution for more details --- http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293916-d301884-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Bangkok-Bangkok.html I was amazed to see people still using traditional ways of welcoming a guest (folded hands like our Namaste in India) with a warm greeting called \u201cWai\u201d. I rarely shook hands during the entire trip and perhaps that\u2019s the most hygienic way of greeting people, which we Indians have forgotten this practice. The Hotel is situated close to the Sky Train station and that was a great advantage. Due to high humidity and heat (it was around 38 to 40 degrees Celsius) I preferred to avoid long walks. Poonsuk was my guide during this trip and he strongly recommended that I take the river cruise to reach the Temple of Reclining Buddha. The high speed boats takes you through the canals of Bangkok and it\u2019s a ride one should not miss. You can see the floating market and also feed shoals of fishes waiting to be fed bread crumbs. The so called guides around the Reclining Buddha temple can be very misguiding. I was told that the temple was closed for the day and while I took a chance to see if the temple had really closed, I was surprised to hear that temples in Bangkok generally remained open until 6pm everyday. Also one needs to be careful of pick pockets and thieves, who target tourists. One of my colleagues encountered a very bad incident when some thieves on motorbike snatched her bag, which contained money, cards and passport. The Reclining Buddha statue is 15 meters high and 43 meters long with his right arm supporting the head with tight curls on two box-pillows of blue, inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The temple is also known as the birthplace of traditional Thai massage. Thai massage is not to be missed but you need expert guidance to choose the right place. I then visited the Golden Mount temple of Buddha located on a hill. By the time I reached the top of the hill after climbing some 200+ steps, the dark clouds hovering in the sky suddenly opened up. The weather was much cooler now and the view of Bangkok from the hill top is just breath taking. On the way back you can see the grand Palace, where the King resides. On the last day, since I had time on hand, I opted for the Safari tour. The Safari World is located close to the airport and far away from the main city. This is perhaps the only safari, where private cars are allowed inside the main park. Here one can see the zebras, rhinos, ostriches and even the lions and tigers at kissing distance. I had never seen a large group of giraffes before, where we can feed them directly from a platform built for that purpose. At an extra cost you can get photographed with a tiger cub or a pair of orang-utans. Inside the park there are several shows that happen during fixed times. I watched the Orang-utans boxing show, the Sea lions show and the Elephant show. I had never seen an elephant paint a picture before and it was just amazing. The safari also has a Egg Museum and they show the entire lifecycle of a bird right from the time the egg is hatched. And this is live!! An enthusiast can spend the entire day at Safari World but I had a flight to catch and hence could not enjoy all the other remaining shows. But I just had time to meet the white tigers, polar bears, seals and walruses before saying Goodbye to the Park.Since this was an official trip and I was travelling without my family, I dropped my plan to visit Kanchanaburi Tiger Temple, Bridge on River Kwai etc with a promise to return again very soon. Amazing Bangkok, it was."

We had read some pretty bad reviews about this place, but luckily read one that was very positive, and talked about going in the morning, so we found this tour company, http://www.bangkokdaytours.com/ , and booked a morning tour. Morning it was, 5am start, but without a doubt, one of the most amazing days of our lives! I don't know what tigers these other people see, but ours were amazing. After handing out breakfast to the monks, we went up to the temple, and they brought out quite a few tigers, ranging from 2 week olds to 2 year olds, I think. The bigger cats were chained to the verandah posts, the cubs were free to walk around to anyone. My twin 13 year olds spent 20 mins nursing, playing with and bottle-feeding 2 week old tiger cubs - omg! We then had brekkie with the monks, then walked the tigers to their enclosures. My tiger decided he was in a hurry at one point, and nearly dragged me off my feet - don't loop the lead around your hand, these animals are very powerful!The feeding and washing is very controlled, but these are big cats, and I guess they have to be careful we don't do something wrong and upset one! It was still great, but the best was yet to come. If you go, wear something that can get wet, because we ended up at the side of a pool, while these amazing animals frolicked and leapt in the air, trying to grab the rags/plastic bags we held above them on bamboo poles. Then, we walked them down to the quarry, where they continue to play and wrestle. The staff are fantastic, and obviously love these animals, I watched one monk sit with a tiger after breakfast, and start boxing with it and wrestling with it. They are obviously very close!After the tiger temple, we went on an elephant trek, and while washing the elephants, swam with them, jumped off their backs, climbed back on, had a ball! Then, to the River Kwai bridge, and the best seats in the house on the floating restaurant. Our guide, Por, was absolutely fantastic, and our driver, Joe, was great. Don't miss this tour, it is fantastic, but get up early, and do the breakfast tour, while the tigers are most active."

            "review": "Tiger temple breakfast with monks (tour 1510). We took a morning tour (for about 20 visitors) with a company called Bangkok Day Tours http://www.bangkokdaytours.com/ which we found searching the Internet. Having spoken to people on our last visit to Thailand they, having done the morning tour, seemed to have a totally different experience to some of the reviews on here. What a wonderful day. The morning is full activity and seeing the tigers in action playing and yes you get to walk, wash, play and feed large tigers, it is no wonder they want to sleep in the afternoon. Don't all cats? It was a bit of a shock being picked up at about 4.30-5.00 on the morning of the trip and a long journey but the tour company provided a snack and plenty of cold water. The transport for my wife and I (we did not pick anyone else up on route) was a spacious air conditioned mini bus and english speaking driver made the 2 1/2 journey as pleasant as it could be. We were accompanied from Bangkok by a trainee guide and picked a very informative and attentive local guide (Koy) nearer the venue. You arrive in time to be briefed by the staff and be provided with food for the monks, this was included in the tour price. You then get to present the food and offer respect to the monks before joining them for a short prayer and then breakfast. Not a full English as you might imagine but a traditional Thai and quite spicey. You then get to bottle feed some tiger cubs, ours were about 4 months old but of course this will vary. We were also able to pet a couple of 12 month old tigers which might sound young but they are nearly fully grown by this age. You are given specific instructions and are warned about how to approach the animals, although cute these are still essentially wild animals and still have their reactions. Following this you get to walk the tigers and the guide was able to ensure that I got to walk with one of the larger tigers with clear instructions that if they stop so do you and if they run then likewise, although walking with the cubs looked fun as they would break into a run and chase coconuts, apparently normal balls don't last particularly long. You then get to wash the larger tigers and as a treat for letting us do all this we get to hand feed them cooked chicke, I must admit to dropping my piece a little prematurely! Better safe than sorry in my book. Then comes the really fun (and scary) bit the group get to essentially play with about 8-10 very large 12 month old tigers. This involves using long bamboo poles with bags on the end to stimulate the animals. This takes place in a bathing area and a tiered waterfall with the tigers playing and running free. Each visitor has a Thai girl with them that are used to working with the tigers and shouting instructions at tourists. It was exhilarating and a little unnerving to be so close to such large cats. With every will in the world it was impossible to keep an eye on all the tigers and occasionally one would rush past me from behind and attack my 'toy'. It was possible to just watch this activity from outside and behind a wall or from inside, as my wife did, with her Thai 'minder'. During all this your camera is entrusted to one of the temples staff who took some amazing pictures of us. There are plenty of opportunities to avail yourselves of the free cold bottled water which was very welcome as even in the morning it was very hot. The next activity is to stroke a fully grown tiger and of course further photographs. You then go to another pooled area where the keepers stimulate by play fully grown tigers. They are free to join in, clim rocks or simply play with each other. I have read other reviews where they have described the visitors being in a 'cage' this is in fact a waist high metal fence and just stops us from wondering off and means they just have to keep an eye on the tigers. That brings a four hour visit to an end. We were taken for a vey nice Thai meal which was included in the tour price although drinks had to be paid for but were extemely cheap. With most tours you break for lunch and then have the opportunity to return in the afternoon with the other hoards of visitors who have usually combined this with a morning at the River Kwai. We instead chose to visit an elephant camp but with a difference - you get to bathe with them in the River Kwai. This is as every bit as brilliant as it sounds. I have yet to compile a list of thing to do before I meet my maker however on that day I surely crossed off two. On the way to the camp the guide stopped and purchased some fresh fruit for us to enjoy on our arrival. Included in the trip is a quick stop at the Bridge over the River Kwai although as Koy explained this was not the original bridge but a similar one brought in from Singapore and is about 200 metres from it original location. However as we were so close it made sense to pay a visit but as Koy explained to really appreciate what it was like to have worked as a POW you need to visit the passes that were cut by hand and the cemeteries, for another visit I am sure.I can thoroughly recommend both the tour and the tour company Bangkok Day Tours, apparently there are several using similar names so be carefully or use the website http://www.bangkokdaytours.com/"

We were picked up on the pier, there were 5 of us, in a very comfortable air conditioned van. Our guides spoke excellent English and gave us a continuous discussion of the country and the city. They had answers for everything. They had made some goodies, local food for us to try. We were a little concerned but finallu submitted. It was an interesting way to try something homemade and different. We toured the Palace, they made sure we saw what we should along the way. We did not feel rushed as we hit all of the high spots. We ate lunch on the river in a huge hall where many other tour groups ate as well. Nothing special but very efficient. They also had a person along to take pictures of everything we did, so if we missed it on our camera they captured it on theirs. They made all the pictures available to us after we got home. This was a wonderful way to experience a different culture."

When you hear these words, one would always know which country is being described.This is what we've experienced during our trip to Bangkok, Thailand to celebrate our second wedding anniversary. It was marked by unforgettable moments with April, Ate Nadine and Jhay. It all started with just a wishful thinking during one of those late night dinners we usually had at Le Meridien. Being myself, I was excited with the idea and immediately researched on the promotional offers by all the airlines. Needless to say, it all paid off because after 6 months of waiting, we finally went to Bangkok and had a once in a lifetime bonding experience. This trip was very well-planned coupled with a lot of online research. We definitely made more effort on this one since we wanted to get the most out of our trip. Not just that, we also wanted to make sure that our friends would also enjoy their first group out-of-the-country trip with us. Bangkok is more than just your usual developing country with all the traffic congestion, street vendors and what have you. Surprisingly for us, it offered a lot of spiritual sanctuaries for Buddhists. Apart from this, it also offered tons of shopping malls with bargain prices on almost all of the items your eyes can gaze upon. The night markets were really on top of my to-do list and it didn't disappoint me at all. Bangkok is definitely a shopping haven for all the shopaholics. Given the opportunity, excess pin-money and valid reason, I would love to visit Bangkok again. Sawat-dee!"

My partner and I were in Bangkok for the week end and decided to do the morning 5 hours tour, through China town and the outskirts of Bangkok. I signed us up only the day before and immediately received a confirmation email with clearly written directions on how to reach the office (inclusive of address in Thai that I could show to the taxi driver). The service was really professional. There were a lot of people at the office and we were clearly told which group we were joining and told where to go. We were helped to choose a bike. All bikes were in good condition. Our group had two guides. We were took around Chinatown first - being relatively early in the morning, riding around was not too difficult. After a few hours in Chinatown and Thonburi, we took a long boat and were taken out to a green, less developed plantation area. We cycled in the plantations and were also shown a very authentic floating market. On the way back, we stopped at a restaurant for an early lunch. The food was excellent.One of the bikes had a flat during the ride in the plantations. One of the two guides took the bike and got it repaired while the rest of the group continued the tour. I was impressed by how professional and friendly the guides were. I fully recommend the tour. I think the one we did was a perfect combination of town and outskirts/canals."

I highly recommend a cycle tour to anyone who can ride a bike and wants to see the real Bangkok that tourists never get to.I was sceptical when a friend recommended this to me. Biking through traffic jams in sweltering hot, polluted Bangkok sounded like my idea of hell. Giving it a go was the best thing I could have done ! Our tour guides, Lily and Jenny expertly directed us through a maze of alleys offering a shady, breezy way of snooping into shops and houses, bringing us into the cool of an enormous flower market. After a meander amongst the fruit and flowers and a snack break...well, I'll stop there as it's all described on the website! I will just say that it was 33C the day I did the trip and it never felt that hot as the easy cycling provided a breeze with little exertion. My advice, JUST DO IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT !!!"

My husband and I had a wonderful 3h bike trip - guided by kind, smart and funny Sandra, with the invaluable help and gentleness of \"superman\". We left at 6pm, after receiving the main instructions of how to cycle in a group. The company makes groups of 8 people - a number that is more than ok for the two people who escorted us. We rode through the historic area of Bangkok, including Chinatown and the Flower Market - and even crossing the river with the bikes in a ferry. Sandra explained a lot about Thai culture and some of the Bangkok history. The tour stops briefly twice for refreshments (included). At 9pm we were back to the starting point. Highly recommend - and, if possible, ask for Sandra and Superman - superfun!!!"

The bikes were not exactly performance machines but they were comfortable, in good condition and were more than fit for purpose.

First of all a short walk through Chinatown to see some of the sights and smells, including a lovely temple and the market. Then we took a longtail from the River City office up to the canals of Nonthaburi. This was a great way to see the city from the Chao Phraya, with all of the sights pointed out by our guide. Once in the canals proper, we switched to a rocket boat. There were only four of us on the tour which meant we had a boat per couple. These things go very fast indeed and it's a thrilling way to get around. Our driver though would always slow for interesting things to see and so we could take in the life on the river. After a stop at a floating market for some lunch, and a painful/enjoyable massage, it was back on the rocket boats, through the lock and onto the main river itself. The drivers opened the throttles and it was an amazing ride down the river. If a little scary!After another market walk and a short rickshaw ride, we got on the commuter boat back down to River City. There's not a lot to say about this tour other than it's brilliant. Our guides, Susie and Im, were knowledgeable and always ready to answer questions. The sights were things you'd struggle to see on your own. And the rocket boats were brilliant fun. Thoroughly recommended."

We finished the talk and had a choice of a city bike or a mountain bike. Once you had chosen they raised and lowered your seat to your needs and did a full check of the bike including pumping up the tyres. We got started passing through markets with all different items, smells and colours. Then we arrived at the train station where we loaded the bikes onboard the train then went and found a seat for a 45min journey into the agricultural part of Bangkok, which i did not realise even existed. So we got on our bikes and headed off, this time on narrow paths with no handrails right next to a river sort of thing. We left that and went onto a dirt road with small rocks, because it had been raining over night, they had really big puddles that you could not go round, so you had to slowly peddle through so you did not get too wet. After that we got to a small shop where the guides bought snacks and drinks to do the last leg before lunch. We got to lunch where we had a Thai meal for an hour then we headed back out for another 20 mins of cycling, then swapped the bikes for a boat. Next we went to a temple and then the boat took us down stream to where we took the sky train and tuk tuks to get back to the office. Over all, the day was a great day, I am 12 and I really enjoyed it. The cycling was quite calm so even my 10 year old brother could manage it. The staff were very smiley and had good knowledge and loved a laugh. I would definitely go again if we ever went back to Bangkok just on a different tour. These tours are for all ages and a great family day out."

From biking through the markets and tiny alleys of Chinatown to the longtailboattrip through the canals of Ayutthaya it was all very exciting and definitely one of the most memorable days of our trip in Thailand.Don't worry if five hours sounds like a huge workout. It's not actually. You only cycle a limited amount of kilometres in total and the boattrip, visiting a temple and also a great meal takes up the rest of the time.You won't be disappointed; Co van Kessel takes you to places you'd never find yourself when you are just like us first time visitors of Bangkok."

Pong was our guide and he did a great job. We visited the flower market, sampled goodies in Chinatown, visited the grounds of Wat Pho and saw it all lit up, and had some yummy street food. It was raining a few hours before, but luckily the rain stopped by evening. We only dealt with a few sprinkles and the tour provided ponchos. The bike riding wasn't too strenuous, and we stopped several times, but you should be comfortable riding a bike if you do this tour. Some of the terrain was uneven and we went through narrow back alleys (which was really fun!). Highly recommend, it was one of the best activities we did on our trip!"

You can see the real way of living for most locals. When you're riding through narrow streets and see people do everyday bussiness in tiny small houses you can really feel, taste and see the local culture of this city. The two guilds of Co van Kessel tours that went with us did a great job taking care of us and showing the way of live in Bangkok. And then there was the trip on the longtailboat, back to the co van Kessel HQ, that was a fun way to end this tour."

At first I was nervous about booking a bike tour in Bangkok, given how crazy the traffic is. I'm so glad I listened to the other reviews and booked this! We spent most of the time off the main roads, darting through small alleyways and passages that wouldn't be accessible otherwise. Tammy and Jenny were excellent guides! They stopped to point out key points of interest, answered all our questions, and always made sure we had water and were comfortable. Highly recommend!"

We did get a little lost following the map they provided us to find the starting office, after catching the metro, but a local helped us find the place right in the nick of time. It was such a fun experience for all ages and abilities, it wasn't hard at all, most of the places we stopped were in the shade. The bikes were very comfortable and did not hurt your bottom. Our guide's Mai and Sandra were very friendly, knowledgeable and nothing was a problem for them. I fully recommend this experience in Bangkok."

Charming markets; small streets; biking the densely populated areas safely and with time to look around. We took the 5 hour trip; but pedaled for about 2 hours or so; we also visited temples; markets; a canal boat ride (a must-do) had lunch etc! Don't leave Bangkok if you didn't take this tour!!!

Cycling though markets, alleyways, across bridges and seeing how the locals live is truely a fantastic and eye opening experience. We really enjoyed cycling through a school where the kids came running out to high five us as we rode through. Our guides were lovely and everything was very well organised. The lunch they provided was so tasty and very authentic. We enjoyed it so much. They also provided plenty of water as it does get hot. We loved seeing the biggest Buddha in Thailand and ringing the huge bell for good luck. The long tail boat rides were so much fun and it was great to sit down and relax for a while after all the riding. We saw Komodo dragons by the sides of the canal and also swimming in the water. The fish feeding was fun too. We would thoroughly recommend this tour to everyone visiting Bangkok. Thank you to everyone involved for a fantastic day!"

All of it was brilliant. The guides were fun and energetic. Roads not so busy from what you see during the day and the opportunities to see the temples and city lit at night is not to be missed. The tour itself is perfect with loads of interest and unusual hi lights. We had an impromptu show under a bridge ..

The trip was 25 kms long and while it didn't feel like a long distance, the heat made it tiring. On this tour, half the time you are cycling along a jetty, which is along side a river. It's about a meter wide, so be careful not to fall off, of the crocodiles could get you! The path constantly has bridges that are not smooth, so it's sometimes necessary to get off your bike and walk your bike over. I was in a group with Dutch people, so they were experienced and I felt we moved quickly! We started with a ride to the train station and we took a train to the outskirts of Bangkok. There were drink stops along the way, a yum lunch, a temple visit, a boat ride, quick market visit, local taxi bus, sky train - so really all bit of everything. Jenny and Gung were just wonderful, answering all our questions, giving encouragement along the way!"

We did the 2 hour canal boat tour, thinking that even in a relatively short space of time, we would get at least a taste of the sites and temples Bangkok has to offer. However, despite the efforts of our guide, there was very little to see other than endless rows of wooden houses on stilts, so there was very little for her to tell us about.We could have stopped after the first 10 minutes because apart from 1 stop at a temple (not a particularly impressive one either) we didn't see anything else of note after that point. In fact it got to the point where the only highlights were whenever we spotted the large monitor lizards at the canal edges.Hopefully their other tours have more to offer. Had it not been for our guide, we probably would have rated it slightly lower than 3"

Decided last minute to book the 3 hour bike tour of Bangkok- bhat950!we only had 2 full days in Bangkok so didn't want to do a full day tour. If you ring ahead you can book in for the tour that morning, ours left at 2pm! The girls Tammi and Mimi our group leaders were great, fun and very informative. We started the your just quick briefing with other members of tour(9 ppl) then we head off on our cute yellow bikes with baskets to Chinatown but not on main roads you travel through narrow streets of Bangkok passing many self sufficient locals and street markets. You visit a Chinese temple and you can go in and have a look.. I must admit we were more interested in the aircon at that stage as we were cycling in 35degree heat. We cycled some more along the river and came to a Thai temple where we climbed up narrow steps to an area where you do a Thai ritual for good luck then climb through a narrow gateway where you are \"reborn\"! Again wasn't out kinda thing but was interesting! Along the way a local person gives you bottles of water then you stop at a 24hour local \"shop\" where you can pick anything you like and get a soft drink.. It's very quirky. Finally you get a ferry back across the tube and finish the tour back at the office. Great day and fabulous way to see the city!"

It was a great way to see Bangkok in a different way, even though we have been to the city many, many times. It is completely safe, most cycling is done thru pedestrian areas, across markets and thru small alleys. There is a guide in front and one in the back. When crossing bigger roads, they help stop traffic to guide you thru safely. There are a lot of stops at temples, markets etc. They offer drinks and snacks and you can try some food at the market. The excellent guides offer great insights into Thai life and customs. Next time we are in Bangkok we will definitely book another trip."

We did a half day tour (which we think is more than enough) and recommend the morning trip. I know, it starts early but it is but it is better than cycling around when it is 35 degrees. You see some excellent sites of bangkok and the old city. As some commenters said, some you can also see these on your own but the challenge would be to find them. The Co van Kessel tour nicely mapped them out and ensurss you get to them safely. With plenty of drinking breaks along the way and a nice boat ride as well as a tour through the countryside this os a great tour and a highlight on our south east asia trip. Worth every penny!"

Flower, fruit and vegetable market, which were really beautiful. We also visited a temple and learned the 3 ways to hold your hands during prayer. After a longtail-boat ride we got to plantations with bananas, coconut and just quietness! Amazing that this environment is so close to the craziness of BKK! The only reason we don't give the 5 stars is the lunch. The river just smells bad and to have a lunch on a terrace above the river just isn't great. The lunch itself was ok."

We covered a lot of ground and saw a great deal of the real Bangkok. What was unexpected was that we were brought down alleyway after alleyway, through areas of appalling poverty. It was actually very difficult to manoeuvre through crowded alleys, avoiding cats, dogs, people cooking etc. It was a fascinating insight into the city. We stopped at the flower market and at a beautiful temple. The tour is worth the money but it wouldn't appeal to everyone."

Firstly we seem to have spent too much time only in \"china-town\", secondly the time spent on the \"long-tail boat\" part of the tour was rather uninteresting and hardly fitting in to a \"bicycle tour\" except if you were interested in knowing how you could fit a good number of bikes and a group of people onto a boat. I also found that, unless you were Dutch, you had difficulty of feeling part of the tour as the great majority of the participants were Dutch and the only 2 other persons were just tagging along and were never made to feel part of the same experience. All in all I would not recommend and would not repeat."

The guides Tammi and Prim/Pimi were very nice, helpful and funny. In our group were families with small children, and teenagers but also couples and everyone got along really well. The guides speak Thai and English perfectly, and they speak a bit of Dutch as well(since there are many Dutch people who do this). During the tour you bike through places you would never come on your own, we saw parts of China town, we went on boats, we biked through fields. You would think a 5 hour tour is tiring, but it is definitely doable. You make lots of stops, to drink or when the guides show/explain something. Water, sodas, a fruit snack and lunch(at the rooftop of a building with a beautiful view) are all included. The lunch was delicious, and there was a vegetarian option. The tour was amazing and definitely a must if you want to see the real Bangkok. Thank you!"

            "review": "The real Bangkok experience. When my husband pulled out the brochure for a 5 hour biking and boating trip of Bangkok, being not very fit, I was a bit hesitant! But actually it was leisurely and allowed us into the real back ends of Bangkok that a normal tour wouldn't see. The guides were very knowledgeable and patient with my 9 year old who struggled a bit through the very narrow alleys - one recommendation would be that they invest in some decent bikes for smaller people as she had a rather old, gearless road bike with dodgy brakes! The boat section was also great - got to see how Thai live on the river. I did unfortunately take a tumble off my bike (my fault) but the guide helped me clean off the mud and cleaned and patched up my wounds and I was able to continue despite a big bruise on my leg and a bigger bruise on my ego! The tour ended with an amazing lunch at an authentic Thai restaurant - a lovely break after all the site seeing.My only other recommendation would be to give groups the option of paying a bit more for a private guide as the group was quite big - as I said my younger daughter struggled and at one point my 12 year old ended up with the big group ahead of us and was a bit tearful when we finally caught up as she didn't know the rest of the group and felt a bit insecure. Although on explaining this to the guides they split us off with our own guide who took us on an easier route so it worked out in the end. We appreciated them hearing us and accommodating for this.Despite my fall I would definitely recommend this tour as an authentic way to see real Thai people going about their days."

We've biked on holidays with our kids (10 & 8 year old girls) in other busy destination and loved the close encounters this type of tour offers. Consequently we booked online thinking that we were going on a bike AND boat tour (the website is too busy and rather confusing). We soon discovered we were without bikes. However we weren't disappointed. Bangkok is after all \"the Venice of the East\" (one of them at least). Our adventure had us travel on 3 different boats. The first a 10-12 long boat (apparently also ridden by Michael Jackson & Angelina Jolli - not simultaneously). The boat was stylish and shaded and a nice start to the day. We headed down the Nonchanburi tributary and transferred to 2 \"rocket\" boats. These things fly and were heaps of fun. The smile on hubby's face was priceless. Our last boat was a ferry service.We covered a lot of ground/water on our trip and saw the real Thailand. Along the way we stopped at markets and temples. Sunday was a wonderful guide. He pointed out landmarks, bought Thai delicacies for us to try. He even sourced cucumber to rub on our daughters' burnt faces (due to too much unprotected time in the pool at our resort). I'd definitely recommend the boat tour (especially after seeing the bike tour groups schlepping through the tight packed spaces in markets and temples the next day). However, do take plenty of sunscreen and a sarong/sulu to act as a sun shade in the rocket boats. Thank you Sunday for a great Sunday!"

And surpassed, had the best time and got to see a whole other side to Bangkok.We'd had a private tour the day before, with a guide, showing us all the temples, let's say, the 'touristy stuff'. Looked forward to another view of Bangkok.As it was low season, we were lucky with just a small group of 6. After instructions (do not photograph while biking! - which we all did, of course) we left. Our guide was A (at least I hope that's how you write it), and guide-in-training Men. A spoke wonderful English, and proved to be not only very knowledgeable, caring for the environment and wise, but also very funny and a great person who clearly enoyes his job, and sharing his knowledge.Started with a bikeride though the smallest of 'streets' (sometimes living quarters of families, who didn't mind at all but called out cheery goodmornings as we passed), over market and though the Chinese part of town, and stopped at some temples. Proceeded by crossing the river, and found ourselves in the midst of lush, green plantations. Wonderful! Stopped for some lovely coconut-icecream along the way. Had a great boattrip with a longtailboat (which took our bikes as well!) along the river. What a great way to experience Bangkok, so quiet and peaceful!On the way back stopped, with the boat, at a small home-restaurant where the table was laid and we got to enjoy some great Thai food - even considerately cooking with tofu for me as I'm a vegetarian. We simply loved this tour, and were very happy we choose to fit it into our full schedule. Felt very safe at all times as A biked in feont, and Men at the back. They literally stopped traffic for us when we had to cross. By all means, don't hesitate, book it and have fun!"

Considering the very high temperatures and humidity - we went for a small boat tour instead of the much more popular bike tours with Co van Kessel. We chose \"Co Canaling 2-hour Longtail Boat Tour\"Reception was professional (although the team was pretty busy) and our guide Tammy was welcoming, warm-hearted and very well well informed about the city, the klong and it's inhabitants. She found an excellent mixture in letting us gaze at the endless impressions and giving us interessting details about the surrounding we were gently passing.The team finally arranged a disembarking at \"Saphan Taksin\" which was very convenient for us in order to directly take the BTS Sky Train."

As it turns out we have seen parts of Bangkok that I would have never visited by myself. Our guides Nuna and Earn were great and especially Earn deserves a spot in the formula 1 pit lane at the speed in which she repairs the different bikes that have flat tires or break down. Though it was a long day I did not get bored and really enjoyed myself. We were with a group of all Dutch speaking tourists and even Nuna speaks some Dutch. All in all: nice bike ride on a wonderful day, good food, many laughs and great memories! Thank you!"

On and off trains, escalators and boats. We were in a small group of 4 but I understand in peak season groups can be near 20. Excellent food, enough drinks provided along thr way, excellent value for money. A day well spent. The company website does not recommend children for this tour and I would completely agree! Negotiating bikes through crouded train stations, up and down escalators is a challenge. It would not be safe with a child or fair for the rest of the group to be held up to accommodate the movement of a child through the icy obstacles. This was our second co van Kessel tour. Our first was with our children - 4 & 12 years at the time. Our children are excellent cyclists, cycling up to an hour at home daily as it is our main trainsport. We did a private 5 hour tour with the children. That was perfect for a family! Thanks A and Co Van Kessel. We will continue recommending your company as the number 1 thing to book in Bangkok!"

The tour was about 5 hours and our guide Tammy was really friendly and knowledgeable. The tour takes you on 4 different types of boat, my favorite was the rocket boat. The 1st stop is a small local town that's pretty far from all the tourist activities. It was interesting to see local life in Bangkok. We sampled a couple small snacks through the town and after about 30 mins we hopped on another boat to explore the back canals of the city. During our ride down one of the canals, we spotted a older women selling Pad Thai on a boat. We immediately jumped on the opportunity to try it and it was one of the best Pad Thai's I had.If you want to explore more of the local culture I highly recommend this tour!"

The tour starts in China town and takes you through the busy streets and alleys. A great way to explore but maybe a bit challenging if you are not used to ride a bike. My partner felt that it was a bit difficult to keep up the pace and have the opportunity to fully enjoy the interesting areas we went through.After crossing the river the biking is more easy and the beautiful Wat Kalayanamit temple was the next stop. The long tail boat ride that followed took us into a green area biking on narrow elevated paths through fields of banana trees. We had a stop at a local floating market before being guided to a local restaurant for an excellent lunch. After lunch a we had a short longtail boat trip back to the starting point. I really like the tour. It is a very special and different way to explore Bangkok and other areas that are not often visited. During this time of the year I would recommend to book the early 7 AM tour because it gets very hot during mid-day.Highly recommended!"

I came here since I wanted to try another place and was interested in the china town area. Also I was surprised by the amount of reviews here on TA but honestly I think most reviewers are first visitors to Thailand. First of, Cycling is always fun. It doesn't matter where you are but exploring a city by bike cannot go wrong in my opinion so it is a companies job to make a bike ride special and memorable. I found the welcome kinda cold at the office from Co, the office itself looks good but there was no personal attention from the staff to the customer. They were only talking to each other and left the customers waiting without any coffee or water (water was free to get yourself but is this service?). Just when I talked to a few other customers we got split up onto different groups so we had to start again meeting people but without and introduction round, the whole tour gets like an individual ride with strangers rather than a fun group of cyclists.The bikes were the worst ones I've seen on all my bicycle tours.. I don't mind paying premium prices but for that I am used to get a decent quality bicycle. The guides English was so-so, not fully understandable by many customers. We even had a crash on the long tail boat ride with another long tail boat. If that was not enough, our boat driver got in reverse to start a verbal shouting match with the other boat driver.... very unprofessional and dangerous. No apologies from the 2 guides as they were busy playing their phones at the back of the boat.The lunch was good en extensive but already served when we got there which made me wonder... how long was it there in the heat and with the flies. I try to write mainly positive reviews but I just left here feeling disappointed.... For the same price there are so much better companies to chose from. Like I said, I understand all the good reviews since cycling is fun anyway and if you have no comparison you would probably rate Co better than I did but my tip is to look further."

Tammy and Susie were friendly, informative and thoughtful guides and helped us to experience an aspect of Bangkok that's off the main tourist track. It was a bonus that we did this during the Songkran Festival - more than happy to be squirted by water pistols as we rode around in the heat! The bikes are basic and look a bit battered, but mine had a very comfortable seat - my main concern! Also, I think riding through on a shiny new bike would be very insensitive to the circumstances of the people whose homes and businesses we rode past. Kudos also to the CVK charity, which I understand donates bikes to kids to encourage them to ride to school."

The way the girls dealt with the traffic was like military precision.We started off cycling through Chinatown, then boarded a train out into the countryside. Cycled alongside the canals, which was both beautiful and peaceful.Then stopped for lunch. All too often day tour lunch stops serve up somewhat bland food to cater for delicate tastes. The place we stopped at served wonderful Thai food. Absolutely delicious. Variety of dishes included meat, fish and vegetables. They continued to serve more food until we had enough and to ask them to stop!After lunch, more cycling by the waterways, visited a wat, then on to a canal boat for a leisurely scenic cruise. Finally, on to Skytrain for the ride back to their office. A long day, with plenty of activities, but not at all tiring.So good, I'm going with them again in December. Very cheap day out, considering all the activities, and all costs are included in the price (2100Baht). Even regular free water/soft drinks throughout the ride.Highly recommended!"

We had previously been to Bangkok so did the 5 hour bike tour starting early morning, the whole trip was fantastic, from cycling through the markets, temple stops, other places of interest, out into the rural areas and on boats, a superb lunch at a out of the way local restaurant, we highly recommend this. Our guide was amazing and the bikes were great. We booked this from home before we left and paid following the excursion. Do it!!!!!"

            "review": "Not fantastic. Had high expectations because of many recommendations and was a bit disappointed.Did the 3 hour biking tour. The first hour of the tour takes you through the Chinese market and the flower market. You get to see some parts of town you would otherwise probably not have seen but most of the time your busy manouvering your bike through way too crowded market streets and wishing you'd had just come by foot to slowly walk around and actually enjoy the market.Our guide was friendly but the tour didn't include any stops for explanations/stories/backgrounds on the city or whatever it was we were seeing. There was one water-break between the 2 markets.Then we crossed the river and stopped at a temple which was nice and there we did get a littlebit of background info. After that we continued for a ride in the old capital and then a break in a garden where our guides bought us soft drinks and chips (and some original Thai chips) which was nice but again- nothing too interesting there.Overall it felt like we were just biking around and didn't learn anything new except for at the temple maybe. And also, they say on the site that while biking, there is a nice breeze so you don't get too hot but we took the 14:00 o clock tour (in April) and were veeeeeeery hot.."

What an insight view into Chinatown nightlife flower market. Had Wat Po and Wat Arun almost alone for our group of 13 participants, mainly Europeans, had local food on a local night market near Wat Arun, crossed the Chao Phra River by ferry with our bikes, great guide, Have seen corners and little streets which we wouldn't have seen otherwise. One of the best tours and experiences in Bangkok, if not even Thailand! Would take part in days tours next time, Good quality bikes!"

Feel the breeze as you zip through back lanes and Soi that you didn't know existed and would never find again! Smile at the many wonderful local people who greet you on your ride. Taste the flavours of China Town and be dazzled by the light and colour that embraces you. Smell the scent of thousands of flowers at the flower market as you weave through the stalls. Marinate in the silence and stunning beauty of Wat Pho by night. Experience the river crossing with your bike and whisk off on the other side to touch old Bangkok under the shadow of Wat Arun.This tour was special and unexpected. This is the ideal tour to see many of Bangkok's attractions away from the hoards of tourists. Truly, we felt like VIPs! Peace, our tour leader, ensured that we were safe and comfortable, could stop for photos as we wanted and was a fun and happy guide. Thanks for a really special evening!"

Co van kessel appears to be a very organised, well run tour group with lots of staff and everything was like clock work. Staff were super friendly. Our group of about 15 people had Pam as a guide who was wonderful, so friendly and helpful and spoke English very well! I was nervous to go on the tour through Bangkok streets as traffic is so crazy and it's so busy but surprisingly it worked well. The only place it was a bit hectic was the flower market. Thai people are very tolerant of the bike tours and seem to just go about their life despite the tours being somewhat of an inconvenience (eg having to move out of the way in the back alley of your house so 15 tourists on bikes can pass when otherwise there is no traffic!) we saw lots of Bangkok that we wouldn't have seen and we loved the food stop for pork mince and rice. My favourite part was riding over the bridge at night with a cool breeze and looking at the lights as well as having a look around a temple at night which was so quiet and peaceful. Thanks for a great tour!"

This was one of the highlights of our whole trip in Thailand and anyone who visits Bangkok, I would recommend you going on this tour. We signed up to the five hour bike and boat tour that kicked off at 7 am in the morning. As long as you can ride a bike, you'll be fine. It's not too strenuous, as everywhere you go is fairly flat and you go at a gentle pace so you can take in all the sights of Bangkok... So why did I love this tour so much? You get a glimpse into everyday life for a lot of Thai people living in the capital, driving through the narrow cobbled streets and markets first thing in the morning. After a decent rude, you board on long tail boat that takes you to west Bangkok and again taking in lots of the non touristy sites of life in Bangkok. After 45 mins, you're back on your bikes riding through a more country terrain of plantations before stopping off for a lovely authentic Thai lunch with a couple that prepared it all. Overall, if you want to get a view of the real Bangkok and see the things that other tourists don't get to see, do this tour!!"

You definitely see a bit of everything as you wind your way through the streets and canals. We took the 5 hour tour from 1-6pm. Here is how the tour works: You meet at the office a few minutes early. We took the boat. If you do, get ready to get off the boat well before you get to the N3 stop because we did not and had to walk back from the next stop. No big deal, just be prepared. The office staff group you up by language and fit you with a bike. Our 9 year old decided it was too much right away and stayed behind with an unlucky adult volunteer from our group. This was maybe the most precient move of the day. The 5 hour is NOT good for anyone less than 12 (IMO). There are a couple of demanding sections that size and ability on a bike are a factor. It's possible that a young Lance Armstrong could handle this. I suspect a 3 hours might be better for younger kids. The group of bikes wind single file through the narrow streets of Bangkok. I'm not going to ruin the surprise by being too descriptive but you are going to ride a bike in places you never thought you would ride a bike. You alternate between riding a bike and loading a bike onto a long boat and riding through the canals of Bangkok. A meal was provided around 1615 and was quite good. Local dishes but nothing too bananas. Only the pickiest eater would fail to find sustenance. We had one toppled bike and one bloody nose and the guides took exceptional care in both situations. Thanks Gini and Pim. This was well worth the cost. If you pay with credit card there is a 3% fee. If I return to Bangkok, I would try one of their other tours."

They also supplied us with plenty of bottles of ice cold water to keep us hydrated. We the rode back on raised concrete platforms between houses, rivers and plantations which was beautiful to look at.Our guides were Peace and Becky who were very helpful and looked after us very well, ensuring the trip was 100% safe.I only downloaded the trip advisor app to read reviews - after this trip I felt i had to leave my first ever review, thank you!"

Much of the cycling was on canal-side elevated concrete paths, which were not wide and had the occasional obstruction. I had not ridden a bike for 45 years, so my adrenaline flowed freely at times. we also rode through the Chinese quarter and the fresh food market.

We cycled through Chinatown the day before Chinese New Year; the area was very busy with preparations for the holidays and we felt lucky to see the neighborhood in full color. The guides were very competent in keeping the group together and ensuring that nerve wracking street crossings were safe (no small feet in Bangkok). A short ferry ride and time spent in Thonburi, a more residential part of the city, were a lovely bonus. Lovely variety of sights during this tour and you notice the friendliness and openness of the Thai people. Kudos to the tour guides and organization of this operation. Note: this tour may not be appropriate for inexperienced bikers simply because of the high level of attention to traffic, riding through very narrow alleys, dealing with pedestrians, that is required. Without years of experience bicycling through crowded streets in the Netherlands, not sure if this trip would have been so enjoyable. We noticed a few members of the group struggling to stay in control of their bikes, perhaps a quick practice session of extra instruction for novice bikers before the tour departs?"

The location was easy enough to find and I managed it using maps.me (offline mapping app) as I know the taxi / tuk-tuk drivers seem to find it impossible to find anything in Bangkok. The office is modern and up-to-date, as you would expect of a company originating from the Netherlands. The bike was modern and I was offered a cycle helmet - which I accepted, thankfully!Our guides were Sandra and Mine and they were both wonderful. We were offered water / soft drinks throughout and saw a side of Bangkok that we could never have hoped to see alone. I found the five hours very difficult due to the narrow paths bordered by swamps; I wish I had been warned that this would be the case throughout the ride as I would have chosen a easier / shorter ride; I walked much of the way. The riverboat ride was fun; they went super fast on the way back and my theme park thirst was quenched. The meal they provided was traditional thai food and excellent."

I do not regret it at all, as it was such a wonderful experience.It was an exciting and serene all in one. The bike-riding was so exhilarating for me, and rewarding! The scenery was more green and lovely than an urban Bangkok. We learned more about a less explored city about 45 minutes outside Bangkok. Their service is tremendous. For my tour, they had two lead bikers so it made me feel secure no matter where I was in our \"caterpillar\" line. They always made sure that we were well hydrated and were always flexible to make sure our needs were met. For example, they made sure that there were vegetarian options for those that opted for it. They are also unique to Thailand unlike other bike tours, so I felt that the tour was full of passion and heart, and stayed true to their mission.Tips: even though they keep you well hydrated, I would bring an extra water bottle just in case. Come early so that you can have enough time to pick a bike that is comfortable for your fit. Bring sunglasses/sun hat as you will be in direct sunlight a lot. Overall, I highly recommend - it was one of my favorite experiences in Bangkok!"

The place is hard to find and our taxi driver got lost several times! Luckily they waited for us and we got nice bikes and a fantastic guide with the biggest smile in Bangkok. She was a true blessing and her English was very nice, her co guide was unfortunately not as good and tried compensating by speaking very fast - no success! The bike ride was a fairy tale. Practically riding in the middle of family life/breakfast/lunch in the most narrow \"streets\" I ever saw. As we got into the more \"not so urban parts\" of Bangkok the narrow, concrete streets in the middle of a jungle keep you focused - you do NOT want to fall on either side as I could see nothing but green water/mud and one can just image what lives in it!

It was really scary in some areas because it was so narrow that there was no room for a missed turn. I stayed toward the rear and sometimes lost track of the group, but the Vietnamese people along the way pointed in the direction I was supposed to go. My husband and one of the guides named Earn followed me. All the people along the way were really friendly - obviously, they are used to having the bike tour pass through. Lots of kids - the toddlers had shirts on but no pants, elementary kids with school uniforms on, and then older kids wearing sports uniforms, many of them putting out their hands for high fives. We really saw the picture of how the common people live - mostly in dark hovels. Tour leader Tami provided cold water which was super refreshing and much needed. We biked through Chinatown with the tight narrow streets and people everywhere. Different streets marketed different items, for example, a shoe street, flower street, etc. We actually abandoned our bikes in the main flower market and walked through as Tami provided commentary about what the flowers were and what they were used for and/or signified. She gave each of us a lotus flower to hold on to until we went into the Buddhist temple. So many flowers makes it seem impossible that they could sell all of them. She said they keep them for twelve hours, then compost what hasn't sold. Many of the arrangements were detailed and exquisite and were used for different spirit purposes: good health, well paying job, etc. She also showed us the three ways of greeting - straight fingers in prayer with thumbs at chin and then bowing, up by eyes - can't remember for what purpose, and then on forehead as part of prayer. I noticed at the airport how many people greeted each other with the straight arms and hands and bows. We biked to the river where we boarded the ferry to cross it which was a great experience. Then we went to the oldest temple in Bangkok with a 16 meter high Buddha. Unlike in Myanmar where gold leaf usually covers the Buddhas, this one was painted gold but was still impressive because of its size. She showed us how to turn down the leaves of the lotus flower to make it a symbol of good luck, then explained how to pray, after which we placed our opened flowers in the offering area. Outside the lovely temple was a huge abandoned construction mess of rocks, concrete, and trash. Sad! We rode through some more local shopping streets (not souvenir kinds of things) until we stopped at another local snack place where Tami offered Thai snacks, another pleasant interlude. All the there on the bike tour were from Holland except for one couple. They asked us which southeast Asian country we would recommend and I said Myanmar because it's still so culturally pure, not yet sanitized. Another ride back across the river on the ferry and we were back at the office. The guides thanked us with a cool wet cloth and we were on our way. I recommend this company to anyone up for an adventure."

I originally booked the night tour and had such a good time I booked one of the day tours too!The night starts by taking you through China Town, following the leader through the backstreets. It can get quite narrow and twisty, and low visibility - something to bear in mind if you aren't a confident cyclist. Our leader was lovely and took us through the flower market in foot , stopping to let us try some of the foods on sale. She recommended the day tour which started early in the morning (to avoid the heat) and I am so glad I did it! On the day tour you start in the city but then go out into the country and see a different side to Bangkok. Plus you get a ride on a long boat which is fun! The lunch they provided was excellent too.On both tours my leaders were good fun and took us on some interesting routes. As an introduction to Bangkok it was perfect. Great for solo travellers too!"

We took 2 tours with Co Van Kessel and both were fantastic ways to explore Bangkok. 1. The 5 hour boat tour - we went on ferries, longtails & \"James Bond\" rocket boats. We sped along the main canals and explored deep, dark corners of outer Bangkok, we ate some fantastic dishes at a floating market and visited a temple where the monks specialise in helping you achieve \"extra lives\" by praying inside a pink coffin. There were 5 of us on the tour which meant we could wander around without calling too much attention to ourselves as \"tourists\" although i think the locals took more photos of us than us of them !2. The 2 hour walking tour of Chinatown - it was just my 8 year old & I on this tour so we had our wonderful guide to ourselves. I absolutely loved this tour, we went down a million alleyways where I would never have dared to venture alone. We ate at various street stalls, talked to locals, visited a Chinese maker of \"funeral origami\" and wandered into temples & markets. You dont see the \"typical\" sights of Bangkok but its a real \"behind the scenes\" tour for those who can see the typical sights by themselves. Totally recommend both tours."

We did the 5hr bike and boat tour and it went by quickly and is not an intensive workout. It's interesting to go through the little alleys, through China town, along the river, into the old capital and around the city. Although you see a lot, it's difficult to know where you are or what you are seeing because there are 10 people in each tour, in a single line and unless you are right behind the guide you cannot hear what they are saying. My recommendation would be for them to do smaller groups or provide speakers on the bikes."

I especially enjoyed the rides on the long boat through the canals surrounding the city, very relaxing and a welcome reprieve from the heat of the ride. My favourite part was feeding the catfish! I have quite a few friends and family who have visited Bangkok; none of them have even heard of feeding catfish, so definitely a special activity.However, the 'tour' part is a bit lacking; there was only one time when our guide volunteered some information about our surroundings - when she discussed the farm land we were looking at - and the rest of the time she only told us where we would be going, nothing about why they chose this place, or the history. It's great to tell us we'll go through the flower market, for example, but tell us about it! Not sure if it was the large group size (14) or that it was Sunday and the markets were packed, but we got separated quite often, and the leader didn't seem too worried about ensuring that everyone made it through - a couple of times we almost lost sight of the riders in front, and had to rely on the guide at the back of the group to tell us which turn to take next.I also found it quite difficult biking on the very narrow cement paths, with their old style bikes that were hard to control. A number of our group wobbled around a lot, though thankfully no-one fell off."

Parts are done by a jetty (boat) that gets you to the sawas bordering the city. Really want to warn that you have to be comfortable on a bike and be able to drive convincingly on very narrow road with sometimes difficult twists and corners. One of my group bikers fell and had some serious wounds."

Through the extremely busy and dangerous streets with vehicles, drivers, bikers, motorcyclists, buses, trucks even humans coming at you from all angles, you had to keep up or sit out! So cycling through China Town with cats crossing your path was adventurous to say the least! However the day (expensive) included local lunch (yummy), train and boat ride to reach the other side. Biking in Bangkok on narrow canal paths was for me tricky but I revel in adventures and new experiences."

He explained things very well and was so nice to us and people along the way (he bought Thai banana for us when the farmer passed us). We biked from the company at Sipraya to China town in small alleys, passing a few fresh markets, and we saw local people doing their routine, cooking, selling foods, delivering stuff with cart, giving foods to monks, etc. We made stops at temples (both Chinese and Thai), local people's houses, plantation, and also noodle shop for breakfast! Even though, I'm Thai, I feel like I want to do this again. :)"

There are an abundance of sites to visit: a Chinese temple, a wet market, a Buddhist temple, canals, villages, a fish feeding spot and the restaurant for a Western-tailored lunch. Our guide, On, was cheery throughout the tour, offering explanations and insight and easily answering any questions that we posed. As an avid cyclist, I enjoyed the busy streets, dirt paths, alleys, elevated paths through wetlands, the highway (against traffic for a couple hundred metres!), even crossing the river on a ferry and navigating the labyrinthine canals in a long-tail boat. Unfortunately, an annoyance that was entirely avoidable was the 45- to 60-minute wait for the locks to exit the canal and enter the river. This is a rapid and pleasant way to see and experience Bangkok in a flash."

I took the tour on Jan 1st which was easier to navigate as most of the shops were closed down for New Year. A bit less urban flavor but certainly an advantage as the bikes were a bit wobbly and I had not been biking for a long time. Our guides Noona and Cookie were great! I would highly recommend this tour to everyone. I live in Bangkok now but saw so many new areas with so much flavor in such a few hours. A banyan tree encroaching into more than 2/3 of a super narrow alleyway was a fun challenge. Great value! Great cultural immersion into what living in Bangkok is outside of CBD."

The part biking through the suburbs felt a bit pointless. Had a great lunch, which isn't always guaranteed as a vegetarian when doing a tour.Would recommend this tour! You need some bike handling skills though if you don't want to go for a swim in the countryside, paths are quite narrow."

Who would've thought that urban biking interspersed with loading your bike on a Thai long boat racing through the waterways of a mega city (18 million), would be so much fun? This company and our guide (Ninna), was top notch. You'll find yourself peddling through China town and the tightest market streets possibly but it all works out. The Thai's see this group coming and are so kind to let you pass....(possibly due to the fact that your a foreigner and who the heck would this besides an adventure seeking western tourist!!). You'lll continue by boat out to the rice paddies still belonging to the Bangkok periphery. It's a great way to see the city and different regions from the steel workshops to the spice and fish markets, to temples, etc. The lunch was a true delight with a husband and wife team the welcomed us overlooking the waterway.A few things to take note of:1. Be confidant and comfortable on a bike. Yes! The Dutch have an advantage here! ;-)2. Take your time and go slow if need be.3. Don't expect a stop and go explanation tour. This is a bike tour but you do stop and regroup at some points. 4. Tip your guide and be compassionate for having had the chance to be well led."

They have a little shop near the river which is easy to find with a free drinks fridge. They fitted everyone out with a high vis vest and you could choose between mountain bikes and single speed bikes. The tour was great, taking in the main sights while it was cooler and not crowded with tourists. In fact I enjoyed this much more than seeing the sights in daylight the next day! The trip felt safe, there are a few narrow alleys but nothing too challenging and the trip is quite slow so was easy to keep up. There's a tour guide at the front and back so no one gets lost. They provided water and a couple of snacks throughout (bananas and a packet of chips). I was hoping for some snacks from local street food vendors but perhaps that isn't realistic in those locations at that time of night! Would definitely recommend, was a great intro to Bangkok"

All of the lows were completely out of our guides control but the company should have researched particular closures due to the massive bike ride on in the city. The guides noona and York were great. And did everything in there power to make a rubbish situation better. Unfortunately we had a member of our ride fall and break his arm so we waited for the guides to get him comfortable and sorted, they dealt with the situation like complete pros. This put us a little behind and we had to try and make up time. The amount of food and drink you are given on the tour is insane, not just water but snacks, ice creams, coffees etc and the lunch was fab, they brought more once we'd finished the first lot, then fruit for pudding. We then began our journey back and there was clearly some problem at the gate as this put noona in a bad mood and we had to wait to get to the platform, it turned out that the second train we were due to get wasn't even running, I would have thought the organisers of the company would have known this?! So God only know how but the guides directed us through closed streets, having to deal with being stopped by police men and wardens. But without much problem noona managed to talk our way across town and back to the shop, were we got more drinks. xkx"

There are no hills in Thailand. Unless you have chicken legs you won't need anything besides a single gear. I wasn't that happy with my bike but that's cause I usually ride a Scott scale 940 hard tail. They gave me a trek hard tail with some gears. Never fell behind, was never uncomfortable, only used two gears over 9 hours. The weakest looking person in our group took the single speed with a basket and same thing. She didn't struggle at all and no one was every left behind. Had Mr Ay at the back cracking the whip, just jokes. He kept the group together always. Personally I should have taken the single speed. Don't have to worry about anything then except for breaking around right turns. For the 9 hour tour our guide Tammy did do some explaining but not that much but I felt it was fine and she did say we must stop her and ask if we had any questions. She did make the ride feel personal ( we were a group of 7 - I've heard the groups can get bigger) We were doing the 9 hr ride though. Riding along the canals is so peacefully and beautiful I didn't mind. We did stop ALOT to taste the local food which was awesome. In fact don't eat breakfast if you're doing the 9hr trip. We arrived after 6:30 which was 9:30 trip and didn't notice any speeding up at the end. (Hope Tammy and Mr Ay don't get into trouble for that comment seeing the last guy mentioned they were on a very tight schedule) I would have been very irritated if I was told to move faster or not take photos etc like the 3hr guy mentions. The standard of the bikes isn't the highest but I think it's got to do with what you are used too. But taken into account I did 9hrs I can totally see how your response is plausible and I would be very upset if I arrived to a bike with flat tires!!! If you're scared of doing the 9hrs don't be. It's so chilled you won't even break a sweat, there literally are maybe 2 hills. Don't know what the other cycle tours are like so can't compare. I have a friend who did the 5 hour with the same company and it sounded slightly similar. everyone in our group loved the day cycling through the city and outskirts. Thanks to Tammy our guide and Mr Ay. You were awesome! "

They assigned a staff just to take care of my two kids and ensure that they were safe. Most of the paths taken were back lanes or bike paths that were free of traffic. When we had to cross the road, the staff would stop the traffic in both directions so we could all cross safely. There is a short section where you have to ride along the road so you have to be a steady and confident rider. There were adequate breaks and drinks and a snack provided. As we rode during the Loi Krathong festive period, we could stop to enjoy live cultural shows of thai dance, martial arts and singing. The flower market was also vibrant as the people prepared for the religious event. It was an eye opening introduction to thai culture.We thoroughly enjoyed the biking trip and highly recommend it."

The view was nice but with not dialogue or information the tour seemed way too long. What am I looking at? What are people doing here? What kind of neighborhood is this? These questions constantly popped in my head but because we were all on bikes and it was a fairly large group (~10 people) it was difficult to engage the guides. In retrospect I would not recommend this tour due to the large group size and lack of dialogue. Certainly it did not meet my expectations -- perhaps the walking tour would be better."

It is broken into a number of experiences with biking, photo-op breaks at opportune moments, learning how to open a lotus flower, visiting temples, Chinatown and the bustling flower market, feeding fish, a superb late lunch and the at times peaceful and other times thrilling Longtail boat. But the best thing was the two tour guides - very genuine, pleasant and helpful.

We were not automatically provided with helmets, but were quickly given them upon request.

The reception area was a bit chaotic when we arrived because of all the tours they run, but once set up with the rest of our group, no problem. There were 10 people in total in our group, so it is an ideal size. The tour was well organised and our guide was very good. The bikes were comfortable - they do not have bells though, and the company does not give any helmets either. We set off in the small alleyways of China town (small being an understatement), and then took a boat to head to the other side of the river to carry on cycling over there, and we came back after dinner by boat again. The tour includes water and food, and has enough breaks so that you don't feel too exhausted. If you choose the afternoon tour, be aware that it gets very hot and so some people might find that challenging.Also if you are not in great physical shape, this tour might not be for you.Overall, a great experience.

Me and my friend were very disappointed as the guide didn't explain almost anything, we spent too much time on boats and what they show is very easy to see for yourself if you rent a motorbike. I have been trhought southeast asia many times. If you are a frequent traveller avoid this tour. The price is incredible too high for thailand. Not recommended at all!!!!"

I've seen people with young kids and I don't think this is advised (I'll explain). Also, it's a bit obvious, but this is Bangkok, if you're not comfortable riding a bike in slightly challenging situations, you may want to reconsider.The tour takes you through some very poor areas, which are interesting to see and learn about. We also rode through very narrow alleys where locals sit around or run their businesses. Like in any really poor area, infrastructure is not very good and you don't want an unskilled person falling into filthy canal waters or biking on local's toes (it almost happened to me). Again the tour is super nice and organized, you just have to be a bit fit mentally and physically and you'll have an amazing day in Bangkok."

Our guide was excellent, funny, some explanations where needed, well organised and a second guide at the end to ensure nobody gets lost. Great service with drinks and snacks. The tour was amazing through tiny paths in chinatown, felt like biking through the living room of the people living there. Nice stop at the flowermarket, temples, crossing the river - great views. The best experience everyone can have - a MUST do !!!"

Riding through small alleys while Bangkok began its day, followed by a longboat ride, ride through plantations, past many temples, a great lunch, and finally a high speed longboat ride to finish by noon. The riding is not particularly strenuous and it's easy to casually look around and take in the sights, sounds, and smells (good and bad). It really was \"the real Bangkok\".

We had one bicycle each. got a helmet and lights. We had two guides with us on our 3 hour tour, on in front and one in the end. We went on the narrow paths between houses and visited both the flower market and China Town. We even stopped for a meal on one of the street restaurants. So if you want to see Bangkok from a different angle, book a trip with Van Kessel and ask to have Maouna as your guide! I can fully recommend it . Enjoy!"

The tour was near to my hotel (Holiday Inn Silom) - about a 30 minute walk. I did the 5 hour morning tour (cooler) which included at least 1.5 hours on boats.  I used to bicycle a lot - around 20 years ago - and they say you never forget how to ride a bike. Well, yes and no. I could balance, but I found it quite tricky to bike thru the tiny alleys and markets and over speed bumps (to keep the motor bikes from going too fast. I spent a lot of time with both myself and the locals in peril. I stayed at the back of the group and the tail end staff member looked after me very well - we did not always ride with the rest of the group. And also, because of this, I missed much of the commentary.All that said, I am really glad I did it. I saw bits of the city I would never have seen otherwise, particularly the bits further out, the areas with fields which were a lot closer to the city than I would have thought. I enjoyed the meal which we had at the end as I did the morning tour. There is a bit of bicycling after the meal to get from the boat landing back to the office - around 10-15 minutes.This would be a great tour if you were a competent cyclist, and is still a good tour if you are not."

This tour takes you through some very narrow lanes and streets stopping occasionally to view temples and markets. We were able to try some of the local produce including the pink duck eggs (black inside) which was interesting. After a boat trip we were out in the countryside riding on very narrow paths with drops on each side (tip of the day - don't try to take selfies while riding here). We had a wonderful meal at a local restaurant along the way before getting back on the bikes and then back on a boat again. If your not an experienced cyclist it's not a problem because it's not a fast pace and every level is catered for. Great way to see the local side of the city."

Honestly, I was nervous about biking around the busy streets of Bangkok in the middle of the summer heat. Although I\u2019m a generally fit person, I do not bicycle often and I get anxious having to navigate crowds and traffic on two wheels.That said \u2013 this tour was wonderful!!! There were a few points requiring some careful maneuvering around stray cats and a few crumbling rocks, but the tour guides were very careful with their guests. I especially appreciated that they employed 3 staff riders with each group \u2013 1 leader, 1 in the middle, and another at the back of the pack. When we approached busy intersections or corners, the middle guide would block traffic and/or ensure that we all were able to cross safely.The tour itself was very enjoyable. We did cover a fair amount of ground \u2013 biking through different areas, seeing the fish markets, etc. We had frequent breaks to get off our bikes and wander through the temples and the markets. Although it was HOT, it wasn\u2019t nearly as uncomfortable as I had anticipated due to the frequent breaks and the fact that coasting around can really cool you down."

We were only in the city for a couple of days and thought this might be an excellent way to see life along the canal system that is so much a part of the city. We were not disappointed! We saw all types of homes, from lean-to\u2019s to mini-mansions. We saw many temples too. You see a lot of people too along the way who were all very friendly. At one point we stopped at a local market. Our guide gave each of us a loaf of bread to feed the catfish in the canal. They were enormous! Some were perhaps 30 inches in length. All had quite the appetite for bread! (Tip \u2013 do not throw bread near your boat unless you are looking for a catfish-induced splash-bath!) By the way, our guide was very funny and friendly and knowledgeable about the area. I wish I would have remembered her name. She was a positive endorsement for the Co Van Kessel tours. We continue on our journey through the canals until we arrived at a small market. We got off the longboat and our guide took us through the market to various food stalls so that we could pick out our lunch options. This was a local market. You could not get more authentic than that. As soon as everyone was full we got back on the long boat and completed our journey through the canals. At one point we encountered a coupled of the flat-bottom speed boats with the big V-8 engines on them. They are little speed boat that are reminiscent of the boats used in an old James Bond movie. Eventually we were back on the Chao Phraya River and back to the dock near Co Van Kessel\u2019s office. We give Co Van Kessel top marks for this tour. A perfect way to see the city if you are on a time budget."

This tour in my opinion is the best way to see Bangkok and made up for the best day of my last few holidays. You get to see the narrow streets and alleys of Bangkok's Chinatown, bike along a canal, through ricefields, see a more rural way of living, watch people living along the railroad and visit a temple. During the day you travel by bike, train, boat and skytrain. Truely a day to remember."

They were proud of their job and happy to talk to you and answer questions. They made sure we were safe and kept on the right path. The story of the origins of the tour is really touching. The lunch was not only fantastic but it also helps the local community you are touring, by using local restaurants and produce. Any food that isn't eaten goes to the children or the monks in the area, so nothing is wasted. The long-boat ride was a surprise, as was the bike ride through the market. If you have to take a camera, your phone is fine, or a small digital. You'll need your eyes on the job, trust me!! Everything about the five hours was a sensory overload. Five hours may seem like a lot but it goes so quickly. I'd also recommend the early morning tour and try a weekend. That way, it's cooler and there's not as much traffic. You absolutely MUST do this tour. It's an experience you will never forget and you will brag to your friends about it too. I can't recommend it enough."

            "review": "Seeing Bangkok in a different light. My friend and I arrived for a weekend in Bangkok night. We booked for the Saturday 2pm tour. The tour started off at the main offices of Co Van Keseel where we were put into groups. Our group was with 15 people ( some children who rode on their parents bikes) We were given a quick safety talk and tried our bikes. Each bike adjusted to fit the rider. Helmets are available to all and are optional. The tour was very well organised. We had two guides - 1 leading and 1 staying behind the last rider.At no point did I feel rushed or crowded within our group. The tour takes you on a 3 hour discovery of the old bangkok town, kneeling buddah, flower market and China town. I would say that starting in the old town would be best as they run the other group at the same time going to China town first. China town is extremely busy and doing it later in the day maybe wiser than doing it first.The old town is gorgeous - hardly any cars and small walkways /allleyways . Totally different than the bustling city that you see when you arrive from the airport. There is water given out along the way so no need take your own. If you have a big bag you can leave it at the office for your return.This was a great afternoon out and well worth the money. I recommend this for everyone. You do not need to be overly fit to do this tour. It is a leisurely ride."

Not just the standard tourist sites. The tour guide Tammy was great and she provided very interesting background on each of the sites that we visited. The biking portion was about 3 hours and the boat was about 2 hours. I was originally concerned about 12of us biking through Bangkok traffic however Tammy and her assistant York would coordinate at every intersection to get us through safely. They stopped and got us water every hour or so and at dinner time we had a huge meal at a local restaurant that was part of the price (although I don't think that's the case for the 3 hour tour. The only downside is that 5 hours can be tiring in the summer heat of Bangkok but we made it through and if you are able to do so I would suggest this one. You get to see the best parts of the city all at once."

It is a leisurely ride, that is flat. No exertion required.There were 15 people on our tour, it was not overcrowded.We had read that the tour get crowded and that multiple groups converge at the same points. Although 3 groups of 15 appeared to set off at the same time, we only passed one other group, who did the route we took, in reverse.The tour guy Mr A, was excellent. He made sure that everyone was aware of the rules, about photo taking etc, and also remindered people again at stops. This ensured that there was no issues, as expectation was set at the start. Tommy the guide at the rear was also really good. Don't expect to stop every ten seconds to take photos.Although we were travelling, in narrow passages and sometimes crossing busy roads, both Tommy and MrA were in control and I felt totally at ease.Get on the bike and enjoy the ride.Definitely would recommend and would try other tours the company has available in the future."

We were taken through the narrow and noisy streets of China Town and as soon as we crossed the river, we found ourselves in quiet and relaxed countryside.

We had heard and read good reviews of the activity, labeling it as one of the best things to do in Bangkok.The moments when we were actually cycling were nice, but most of the time you are more or less walking with a bike between your legs. The streets are too crowded and small and the other people in the group kept using their cameras while cycling (despite instruction by the guide not to), which made moving in a nice flow even more difficult. The first stop of the tour was at a random temple. Instead of telling something about the impact of Buddhism on Thai life or the rituals the Thai people perform at the temples, the guide was preaching about his interpretation of what's good and what's bad. The second stop was at the flower market, where you get 15 minutes of time to wander around before trying some Thai fruit. This took up more than 45 minutes of the 3h-tour biking tour. After that, we walked/cycled through Chinatown back to the office. Basically, what the tour does is show you some parts of Bangkok without putting it in context. The information given by the guide is very, very limited. That's a shame, given there's so much to tell and explain. I would recommend anyone who is interested in discovering and learning about Bangkok and Thai culture to do a proper guided tour. If you're looking for just a gimmick - bicycling in Bangkok - then you'll probably have a good time."

There are points along where alleys are too narrow and bridges too steep that you'll need to hoof it (ie: walk your bike). Speaking of bikes, don't get the mountain bike, opt for the traditional hybrid / granny bike instead - it has cushioned seats with spring suspension; your butt at the end of the day will love you for this. Perhaps bring cut off biking gloves too. I took a spill and \\the gloves saved my hands!! Wear shoes / maybe sandals, but not flipflops. The included sit down lunch in a village in the middle of a rice paddy out in the middle of nowhere was sumptuous - unlimited food. I think you had to pay for the drinks at lunch, but they were very cheap. There were included drink rest stops along the way, and you will also visit a temple.This tour is not all bike riding, this also includes a boat ride, and old train ride, and finally, the modern metro to get back into town, so there is sufficient rest in between and suitable for ages 10 and above.Our tour guide Andy definitely loves her job !!! Thanks for the memories !BTW, this tour is limited to ~10 riders per group, if there more, then another group is formed, due to busy traffic conditions and small alleyways - not easy stopping traffic for 30+ bikes to go by."

It does take some concentration to make sure you don't hit anything/anyone, but that just adds to the adventure. We got to see so much of the city that we wouldn't have been able to on our own. The bicycle tour also reaches areas that are not accessible by tuk-tuk or car. Same goes for the boating portion of the tour. We wouldn't have had time to get past the city limits without this option. It was a really great experience navigating through the narrow klongs, exploring a small floating market, and riding bikes by lemongrass and galangal farms.

Loved the trip and the chance to see the other side of Bangkok that we probably wouldn't take our children by ourselves. Parts of the cycling is pretty narrow but the Thai people just waited for us to go through. Loved it and thoroughly recommend booking."

Our guides were extremely friendly and knowledgable about the local area and we felt completely at ease throughout the tour. The places the tour takes you are more or less inaccessible in any other way apart from by boat and bicycle which made it feel even more special. I'll come again and bring the family on this excellent adventure!"

            "review": "Good Tour and Glad We DId It. This is a decent tour. I had a hard time deciding between the 5 hour and 9 hour tour. We chose the 9 hour tour. It was a good way to see areas you would never see. We rode our bikes through narrow alleys and spaces and shops that seemed to go on for forever. It was really cool to see everything. My favorite part was the first hour going through all the shops. We got on a train to head out of the city for 45 minutes. It was an old train and that was kind of cool. We rode our bikes along canals and a meter wide path where if you fall off then you're falling 10 feet down into water. I'm not sure if you do this for the 5 hour tour but you need to have a little level of fitness and be somewhat confident on a bike to do turns and pass mopeds on a 1 meter wide path. There were normal paths too. We saw some nice sights. Lunch was excellent. There was plenty of food and they catered to different eating restrictions. We always had water and snacks on the trip. Our main guide was upbeat and playful and fun. There was no talking from the guide really about culture or the buildings. Two of the guides didn't really speak English. If you were in the front, you might have heard her say things. By the end of the day, it was exhausting riding the MRT back to the Tour Company. The boat ride was nice and a nice perspective to see all the people on boats and see a lot of houses along the river. So it is a good tour. I'd give it 5 but there was not much talking from the guides when we went past certain areas or when we stopped so we really didn't learn much other than seeing the sights. If I were to recommend it to my friend, I'd tell them to do the 5 hour tour unless they really wanted to see it all in a long day. Bring your sunscreen. Water was plentiful from the guides. Get a good bike seat because 9 hours is long."

We were 2 families, 9 persons altogether, which fit nicely. Our tour guide called \"M\" did a great job, very pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable guy. Only he could have explained a little more by himself, maybe. We also brought a two year old infant along, no problem.

I did a lot of research and chose this company because they were extremely flexibile and offered the exact tour I wanted- a 5 hour bike tour that combined a long tail boat tour and that also went to floating markets (not the big touristy one but a small local one). They allowed me to pay a supplement (equivalent to another 2 adults) so that the 4 of us could go on a private tour and start at 9am instead of 7am. I have 2 daughters aged 9 and 10. I had read another review where 2 girls of similar age coped with this tour. I have to say that although the company was fantastic in every way and provided great bikes of appropriate size and helmets etc, riding in Bangkok is not easy even for an adult let alone a child! Within 5 minutes of starting and riding in narrow laneways which twist and turn and trying to avoid people, animals and scooters my younger child was crying and couldn't continue. One of the two female guides we had took 2 bikes back and brought my husband a bike with a little seat and my daughter sat behind him for the rest of the tour- problem solved! It was a little difficult for him but she is only small so they managed. The other daughter gritted her teeth and continued but once we went in the traffic (yes main roads with trucks, cars, scooters, tuk tuks driving within inches of us) my heart was having palpitations and I was questioning my parenting skills. After a while you do realise however that whilst we aren't used to this kind of chaos on the roads, the Thai people are and somehow it works :)After leaving the backstreets of Chinatown you cross over the river and ride through coconut plantations riding on 1m wide concrete paths over water with no barriers - again causing palpitations for the adults let alone the children. We also boarded the long tail boat (bikes and all) and went to a floating market trying food along the way. We ended the tour with a gorgeous lunch in a little restaurant by the river. Despite being hot and scared at times, we had the best time ever. We saw so much that we never would have otherwise and Miss Prem (our main guide) was informative, kind, patient and very professional. We will definately do a tour like this again when we visit Bangkok and highly recommend it but just be mindful of children. Whilst our girls can ride bikes competently in Australia (although probably don't ride as much as the average Aussie kid) it is very different doing so in Bangkok."

I think that's the best time to start because the temperature is still nice and you start in Chinatown which will be more busy if you take the tour in the afternoon. The bikes are in a good condition. Our guide M did a good job, his English was good and he could even speak some Dutch words. You need to have some skills to ride a bike in the narrow streets you sometimes go through, so would definitely recommend this for Dutch people. The nature you go through with this tour is beautiful, you will never discover this by yourself."

Along the way we visited two ways, made our own lotus flower offering, ate ice cream, learned how to properly sit and pray in a Buddhist Temple. And had a tasty lunch. In addition to that we rode in a long boat along the river. All in of this in a 5 hours time. The total ride was just under 11 miles, per my Strava biking app.All of us thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

We went from the shopping mall where the tour starts, and our guides give us an explanation of what we will see, so we go down some very narrow, winding alleyways, to the small \" taxi \" boat on the Chaopraya river, crossed over to Wat Arun, and began our tour of the Chinese Quarter. Now this is something a lot of tourists will not see, a system of narrow streets, with small \" home style \" businesses of every description, car/van / lorry repair, fruit/veg sales, clothing, baking, etc. We stop at a Temple for refreshments, and to look at the decorations that adorn the temple, we were lucky, because in two days time, they were about to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and everybody was running around, getting things ready for the big day. Again, we meander thru the narrow, winding streets, stopping at various points for refreshments and a chat with the guides for points of interest.We cycle back to the river, cross over, and make our way to the Chinese Flower Market. This place is massive, it is where all the flowers come in from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, to be sold to other markets, hotels, restaurants, but the sale of the flowers takes place in the very early hours of the morning ( about 02.00 ), so we see the preparation for the following early morning sale, lots of people pushing barrows, carrying baskets, buckets of ice, water EVERYWHERE !, and of course small food stalls ( stir fried crickets with chilli was a favourite of mine, yum yum ! ) .Back on the bikes for the last lap of the tour, down narrow streets, and eventually, arrive back at the shopping mall, for cooling towels and a drink.This trip is about 4 hours long, and it takes you to places that you will not ordinarily see in Bangkok, the pace of the tour is relaxed, not the Tour De France, it is a look at a community that has established itself over centuries, but has kept itself private to itself.Well worth the money and the experience...DO IT !."

My son said it was the same fun like riding a waterscooter, which pretty mutch says it all. He rode a bike witch had a monkey bar steering. Gave him the laid back style he wanted. And gave me a lot of laughs. And my daughter loved when we entered a primary school, speaking with the pupils. My wife was also enjoying, even though she didnt ride a bike since last summer in Norway. I really liked the small back alleys riding though where the locals live. I was wondering if the rating was to good to be true . But it wasn't, it really is a must and a good chance to go clear of all the shopping centers around.

Perfect timing and variety. We cycled out of the city, took a longtail boat up the river and through the water villages to the green belt. Cycled through various plantations, had a sensational Thai dinner, cycled some more. Back to the longtail boat to the city. We fed fish in the river and performed a prayer in the Chinese Temple - things we wouldn't have felt appropriate to do without the help of our guides. Pacsoi and Top were our guides. They were so good with the children and looked out for our family so well. Pacsoi is one of the most joyous people we have ever met. Will certainly return and do other tours.

At the beginning we weren't completely sure about doing this tour because of the prices - compared to other things in Bangkok it is not that cheap and our budget was limited. But 30\u20ac is not that much so we gave it a try! We took the 5 hour bicycle/boat and it was the best thing we did in Bangkok without any doubt! Everything was perfect, from the arrival at the meet point (which looks pretty nice) to the smily guides, the awesome places we visited that you will never go alone, things we learned about Thai culture, food we tasted...awesome!"

This was one of the highlights of our trip, we did not have high expectations for our time in Bangkok and only spent one full day in the city. We heard about this tour from some people from Holland we spent time with on another tour in Chiang Mai. Our guide \"A\" was great, very helpful and really seemed to care about supporting the local people especially the ones along the tour route. We went all through Chinatown, saw how people live there. Then toured a little way outside of the city into the plantations where is was amazing to see all of these small farms right inside the city and how the families that run the plantations live. My wife and I are not into the nightlife aspect of what Bangkok has to offer, and this tour EXCEEDED our expectations significantly. We were lucky to only have a group size of 4 people, which made it even better for us. I would highly recommend this tour, we did the 5 hour tour that started at 7AM, helped us to beat the heat a little bit and gave us the rest of the day to explore Bangkok a little bit on our own."

Make sure you know how to ride a bike because I was definitely not at the top of my game. At one point we rode in the opposite direction of traffic but no need to worry. No one has the opportunity to speed or drive fast since it's so congested. I learned when walking the street to just keep the pace, drivers/motorbikes will stop for you or go around you. If I'm to visit Bangkok again with family or friends I would make sure to do this tour again!"

This was my fourth trip to Bangkok, but I had never seen any of the things Andy showed us. 5 hours and three different boats.They offered us snacks to try through out the trip, and and bought bread for us to throw at the cat fish. We stopped off and Andy bought us noodles for lunch which we thoroughly enjoyed. Getting in and out of the boats was not as easy for the folks as it was for us, but Andy and Boo were always there to assist and it really wasnt a problem.The market was an eye opener for me, but I was glad I finally got to see a \"live\" market like that. I was glad Andy and Boo were there to explain to us what we were seeing. Going to places where it felt like we were the only tourists there was an absolute highlight. Walking around shops that had no english on the glass panes, and seeing the wooden houses along the klongs made me feel like we were seeing the true Bangkok.We couldn't have asked for better guides to see these attractions with. Andy is really special and Boo(Crab) is going to make a wonderful guide soon. It felt like family.I will recommend this tour to anyone visiting Bangkok. You are in for a treat."

Brief tour over the river and canals and continue biking through the country-side. Some of the paths are just 1 meter wide so basic bike-skills are a bonus, plenty of interesting stops, foto moments, refreshments and a delicious lunch! So, of you do anything in BKK do this tour. Get out of the shopping malls and get down amongst the Thai. See another part of BKK, you won't regret it!!"

The bikes are acceptable and you go through all the areas that you probably wouldn't go and would definitely get lost in if you did. You are taken to the other side of the river and it is really easy and comfortable on a pushbike, so you don't need to worry about keeping up with everyone else, because trust me, you won't be the slowest! The canal trips are a welcome relief from the heat and the food when we stopped at a local restaurant was a good standard. We even stopped at a local primary school and the kids try out their language skills on the tourists which was a breath of fresh air, which reminded you of an age in England in your childhood when you didn't have all the politically motivated sickos thinking the worst. Of all the places and people who deserved a contribution in my travels in Thailand, this school was it, but no-one asked and I didn't offer because I thought they might no offended, my friends thought the same. Id rather tip a worthy cause than a drug addled moronic tuk tuk driver! Please do this trip, I know I will when I go back again. Take a hat though"

Taxi price however still only 120 Baht (some four dollars). The combined boat and bicycle tour is great, the boat trips are part of the full tour and you take the bikes with you on a fast river boat. The tour takes you to temples, Chinatown, market, narrow streets, but also a couple of kilometres through a more agricultural area. Lunch was included and top notch at a small mom and pop shop along the river, Pensri restaurant (not separately listed on TripAdvisor). Sufficient water was also provided along the way. Bicycles were in reasonable state, it is worthwhile to make sure your tires are hard enough before departure.Our guides Aorn and Jinny were cheerful and got along well with my two young adult children.

First is an exhilarating ride through Chinatown's streets and alleys; it feels like you get to see the \"real\" Bangkok.

Finally, a long-tail boat brought us back in Bangkok and we finished the ride in the city. Ms. Water provided excellent factoids about our various stops and was eager to answer our questions.

After having found the Co van Kessel location, you are welcomed in a really friendly way. Given a drink and introduced to the rest of the people that you will be riding along with on your tour. You get to pick your bike of choice which is either a normal citybike or an all terainbike. We chose the latter. This one has no place for your belongings so make sure to bring a daypack. However, the thick tires will proove to be more stable to some extent while riding through gutters and such. 2 tourguides will acompany your group. You ride through bikenarrow alleys, along sleeping Thai and playing children. Traffic is insane but you'll be fine. After a while you get to a jetty where a longtail boat takes you across the river. Enjoy the peace and quiet there. Enjoy a great early dinner which is served some time later. This, I think, is pretty much the ONLY way to get a feel of what Bangkok really looks like.

I was doing this amazing bicycle trip wiith my sister and parents and we all agreed that this was one of the best experiences on our vacation and something that we really will remember for the rest of our lifes.Cycling through the neighbourhoods, markets and narrow alleys in the city was really exciting. The tour lasted around 5 hours, but don`t worry, it was not too much, even for my parents who are almost sixty.The guides was very good as well and took good care of our safety and provided a lot of information along the route. We also had lunch at a small local restaurant along the river which was fantastic.I can highly recommend this tour for everyone and I will for sure do another one when I return."

The narrow path above the water was a bit tricky and maybe more suitable for the experienced cyclist but it was a really nice area which I am sure I would never have been otherwise. The guides were lovely and all the little children along the road giving us enthusiastic high fives just adorable. The food was delicious and the overall ambiance was great. Co van Kessel tours was recommended by many friends of mine and it did not disappoint. Truly my favorite day during my week in Bangkok."

Our guide, Amy, was amazing and she took this already excellent tour to a whole other level. We got to see plenty of different sceneries and tasted a lot of fruits and other local foods. We travelled by train, boat and skytrain and this provided some nice moments to sit back and enjoy the view. 9 hours is long, but there are plenty moments to rest and get a drink. We never did a tour that was so impressive and in which we felt so well taken care of! Well done amy and co van kessel tours! Thank you for an amazing day!"

Riding through the alleyways first thing in the morning was truly memorable. We chose the 5 hour bike and boat tour from 7am to midday. Our tour guides \"On\" and \"Ginny\" were so fantastic and friendly. We stopped for a lovely lunch with plenty of gorgeous Thai food. This was my first visit to Bangkok and this tour enabled me to see so much more than I originally expected to due to it only being a two day visit. 3300bht for the two of us, in my opinion good value for money. Couldn't recommend it highly enough, if we had time we would have done the night tour to explore other areas too!"

We wound through narrow alleyways of Chinatown, into a huge wholesale market, selling flowers, vegetables, fish and more to small shop owners. They even had a group exercise class going on in the middle of all this activity. We stopped at a beautiful temple, and a market where our guides bought local treats for us to try. The boat rides took us through an extensive system of canals, unseen from the busy streets above. We navigated concrete bike paths through banana groves and residential areas. The tour also included a delicious lunch of traditional foods. All ten of us couldn't say enough about this incredible experience!"

Me and my girlfriend did the 9-hour tour and it was amazing. They truly show you a side of Bangkok you don't get to see, or maybe even know about, if you haven't done the tour. 9-hours might seem like it's a long time spent cycling and that it might be difficult, but there's quite a few stops. Some in the form of a visit to a temple, or just a quick drinking/snacking pause, and of course the train ride, boat ride and lunch (which was really good and at a very nice location in the middle of some rice fields). We had a very good tour-guide as well who could tell us all the details on the places we visited and was very kind."

There were approximately 25 of us at the outfitter and we were divided into smaller groups of about 8 people and two guides. From the start we were lead through a labyrinth of backstreets and saw parts of the city where most tourists probably do not venture. It gets a bit narrow and crowded and at a couple of points we had to either dismount from the bike or be extra cautious in order to navigate through very congested areas. But what fascinating urban scenery! Along the trip, there were a few noteworthy stops to visit temples, etc, which really rounded out the experience nicely. You eventually reach the end of the road - quite literally -- and switch briefly to river boats - bikes and all. From there, it\u00b4s a fascinating trek through the jungles of Bangkok and often you are pedaling on a somewhat narrow strip of cement in a sort of residential jungle, with daily life happening all around you. Lunch was a decent, relaxed affair and a nice time to make smalltalk with the others in the group. Our guides were super-friendly and competent. Cannot recommend this experience enough to those who appreciate a more active, adventurous way of getting a closer look at things."

But I felt safe throughout the tour.One point why we chose this tour was because we had already seen the main attractions of Bangkok and now wanted to see the more rural parts. We sure saw this as well.Food was provided on a boat, nothing overly fancy, normal thai but sure tasty. Also water was provided at the start as well during the breaks. (free)The 2 guys in our group (we were 3 girls, 2 guys) were a bit suspicious when we introduced the idea of this bike tour to them but were really happy to have done this afterwards.As was me - happy enough that we are going on another tour when back in Bangkok (which will be in march ;) )"

The trips are suitable for all age groups and you don't have to be an experienced cyclist - just a bit brave. Path are in places very narrow, unguarded and 'obstacles' are frequently in your way.

We took small roads to a Chinese temple and to a market hall where we tried funny but yummy food. Cycling was fun and safe cause the two tour guides took good care of us leading us through the traffic. After a while in bustling China town we crossed the river with a boat. On the other side we cycled along the river. Shortly after we arrived at the temple with the huge sitting Buddha. Later we got on a long tail boat and enjoyed a fast ride through the small canals of Bangkok. The trip took us to a more rural area where we got on the bikes again. After a beautiful ride we got a great lunch at a small bar next to a canal. We took the boat back to city centre and cycled back to the office. It was such a relaxed and atmospheric way of exploring the different faces of Bangkok. We do definitely recommend this tour to everyone who wants to see and experience a lot in a relatively short time."

If you're an early bird; ofcourse, do the early one!

During the tour we went through the narrow alleys of Chinatown, went on a train outside the city where we biked through the countryside. We received complimentary drinks and snacks at many occassions, including Thai lunch in a nice restaurant. On the way back we put the bikes in a longboat, which brought us back to the city.The tour guide was very enthousiastic and had great knowledge about many aspects of the city. I would encourage everybody to take this tour because it is a great way to explorer the city of Bangkok. It's definitely \"off the beaten track\"."

We booked one day ahead through their website and everything was super organized from the get go. Biking is just a great way to see some parts of the city as you just buzz through. We booked a 9h tour so we also got to go to the outskirts of Bangkok. It was super relaxing as well as beautiful. We stopped often for the much needed refreshment and had an amazing lunch near a rice field. The guides were very thoughtful and we were well provided for. Little local snacks here an there made for a wonderful experience. Bangkok is beautiful and this trip is an absolute must if you want to see a little bit more than the tourist routes and would like to get away from the frenzie. Again, absolutely wonderful."

The manager of the hotel I was staying at in Koh Samui recommended this bike tour and Im glad I did.A guided bicycle tour in Bangkok Chinatown and its all of its hustles and bustles, and through working class and middle class neighborhood, canals, temples, and outside of the main Bangkok, I think its West Bangkok, the rural farm areas. Its sounds crazy, but this tour is FANTASTIC! This tour takes you places, and parts of the city you would probably never go by yourself, and shows you a side of the city that is very different from the big tourist attractions. We went through ridiculously narrow alleys, busy streets, sharp turns, avoiding the obstackes and market vendors, elevated narrow road, that if one quick mistake will get you down to the embankment - there was a few times that afraid I might fall in the water. I was so surprised how we went from the dense urban houses to the suburbs and to the farm fields. The pace if quite exciting and fast especially when we jump off into a long boat and the ride through the canals of Bangkok, It like a scene from a movie. The tasty lunch that was served was very tasty, the outdoor eatery by the canal was authentic tasting. Some of the best meal Ive had in Bangkok. Prepared by a very nice, friendly couple. Its just how I imagined local people eat. This was one of the best 5 hours tour Ive ever taken. It went by so fast, that I didn't want it to end. The group was rewarded with a great view of the sunset and the Bangkok Skyline. Thank You to our tour guide Amy and Yung. Very knowledgeable and professional. I really enjoyed them showing us their city, and sharing it with the group. I would definitely will recommend this to anyone visiting Bangkok. It is a MUST! Looking forward to my next trip back. I will try the 9 hour tour next time."

Then we loaded the bikes onto a long tail and had a cruise along the klongs to the inner west suburbs in Bangkok and rode through a few villages in the suburbs. Great experience, not for the faint hearted though, riding along narrow concrete paths through the fields with no barriers on the paths, care needs to be taken not to come off as water on either side with lizards and possibly many snakes amongst the dense watery growth on either side.The two guides we had were very entertaining and knowledgeable.The only concerns I would have would be the fact that there was a thunder storm with lightning that was very close, I think this could be very dangerous, especially seeing we were riding along side the water when the lightning was striking.Would highly recommend this trip to anyone."

We had only two days in Bangkok, and the cycling tour had been recommended by a Dutch friend - we went on our second day, figuring we'd have a better idea by then how early we'd need to be up to travel to Co Van Kessel's offices where the 5 hour tour was to start at 7am. We arrived with plenty of time to spare and were glad we took the morning tour - not as hot as later in the day and the hustle and bustle of the market we visited on our trip was a delight. We were also fortunate enough to see the beginnings of the Chinese Vegetarian Festival. Our guide took us to all sorts of interesting sights which I gather change day to day and so the tour is always a different experience. We loved cycling through tiny alleyways, crossing the river on the ferry and then heading off on the long boats to then explore farming regions. A delicious lunch was had late morning and then back for more cycling and another thrilling boat ride! The 5-hour ride seemed daunting but it's an easy ride, mostly very flat save for a few small bridges (just hop off the bike and walk it!) and it really is the best way to see Bangkok. I can't recommend this activity highly enough!!"

It was a challenge keeping up with Noona, our guide as she ducked and dived through alleys and around cooking pots and squawking chickens but what was truly fab was being off road for 5 hours. We cycled down alleyways and along canal paths, went out into the jungle and market gardens outside Bangkok, through middle class suburbs and put our bikes on ferries and longtail speedboats. We visited off the beaten track temples and had a late lunch in a rickety street restaurant on stilts. A brilliant way to see traditional bangkok and stay off the roads and away from the traffic."

Some reluctance to go on a 9 hour Group tour, but as it involved the bike, boat, train and sky train it looked diverse enough. September, we had a group of 5 participants and 2 guides. So special attention all around from Pang and Andy, great and chearfull guides! First you were 'fitted' a bike, great to make sure you were comfortable riding it the whole day. The variation on this tour is exceptional, 'inner Bangkok' Town, Chinatown, Green zones via the ride by train (where the bikes needed to enter the train through the window), boatride and the continious care for the inner person. More than enough food and water was provided. Lots of fun and laughter, cultural awareness and a bigger picture of Bangkok. Thanks Andy and Pang!"

Because I had not taken one of these before I felt a good way to start would be the 3 hr one. They offer regular city bikes as well as the 10 speed ones. Two people go along with you. The lead and someone in the rear to make sure you don't get lost. You go thru little back alleys of Chinatown, the flower market and eventually go across the river with your bike to explore the city on that side also. It was an informative, fun packed morning. They supply plenty of drinks also so you don't get dehydrated. No special skills are required. Just the basic knowledge of bike riding."

We only had time for the three hour cycle tour and it was fantastic. Great directions to the company's office and had the most brilliant tour guide called Jackie. Her English was brilliant and she explained everything for us showing us the real old quarter of Bangkok. The ride itself was very leisurely and we felt completely safe despite being in a group of 20 with 2 guides. We stopped off in the Chinese quarter first and went to a Chinese temple. We got tonight incense and explained the difference between a Chinese Buddhist temple and a Thai one. We then went on to a beautiful market and then a church. We later gently pedalled to a Buddhist temple with a 16 metre statue.What I liked was how we were explained how and why the Thai people pray at the temples and I got to find my fortune too! I hope it comes true because it was good :)I have found that a lot of Thai temples are a bit boring because we don't know what is going on, not having Jackie there to explain really helped. We crossed the river on a ferry and later stopped at a park for refreshments. We were given by the guides a bag of crisps and a soft drink which was very kind. After that we had a gentle ride back to the ferry and then onto the company to return lie bicycles. It was nice how when we were riding along the streets the locals would smile and wave at is, not all of course but a lot. There were even children high-fiving us which was cute. The tour was not strenuous but it was a very hot day so you do not need to be super for to do this. I definitely recommend this attraction as it is a wonderful way to see the real Bangkok and not just the hustle and bustle of taxis and business men. Ask for Jackie!"

Our guide Pakchoi (?!) was highly motivated, incredibly funny and showed as a Bangkok totally different from what I had seen before because we took all the small and narrow pathes you would never be able to find yourself (nothing for claustrophobics though ,)After cruising a while in chinatown we had a really delicious local thaifood lunch and afterwards an exciting speed boat ride.All in all great fun and worth every penny of the reasonable price !Do it"

We were in a group of three people so I guess we had a lot of personal attention :-) we learned a lot about Chinatown, buddism culture and they took care of us providing drinks, chips and a poncho. I recommend this tour for your first day in Bangkok because you'll get a nice overview of a substantial part of the innercity. Also, if you're staying near khao san road, i think the (orange) river taxi is the cheapest way to get to their office. Phra arthit pier to si praya."

It started at 7am so we got to see the hustle and bustle through Chinatown as everyone was waking and getting ready for the day. We saw lots of glorious sights and lots of eye-openers - things we would never have seen had we not heard about Co Van Kessel.We visited temples, river markets, little villages - lots of places! And each was as exciting as the last. We also had the boat trip which was great - a nice welcome break from cycling in the sun (!) and an opportunity to see things from the other side.At the end we had a gorgeous relaxed lunch which was included then headed back to return our bikes. Our tour guide was fantastic and really interesting. I was travelling with 4 friends and it was just us and a family of 4, which made for a great sized group.Just a tip, the cycling isn't particularly strenuous, however add the 35c degree and it can be! So make sure you bring water (you are also given some a long the way) and eat breakfast before you go. You also have some challenging little bridges and footpaths to get through so not for the faint hearted!Overall a fantastic experience - highly recommend it!"

Started off the day as usual taxi driver not actually sure of where they are going in this huge city, but we found it, rather large bright yellow shop front, thank god. Complimentary bottles of water and a quick run down of things to do and not do, please test run your bike, I didn't I went to the rest room, when I came back, one of the guides said did I want to have a quick spin on the bike to see if it suited me, I said \"no I ride a bike all the time\", so I let everyone go in front of me because i was the oldest in the group, jumped on the bike and then realised I was a pre world war ll but I need a basket to put my gear in so thats why I chose it. After a bit of wobbling and the guide panicking, I managed to stay on. So pick a mountain bike and take a backpack. The day was absolutely fantastic riding down tiny little alleyways u would never normally go by yourself one guide in front and one at the back, good english and knew everything about the area. We all then jumped on a ferry then a longboat more riding then the lunch, which was divine. A tiny little restaurant that I would not dream of going to on the canals, the feast was fresh and full of flavour by far the best food I had eaten this trip. Back on the bikes more sightseeing another longboat, the ferry and back to the office. I can't recommend this company enough :) ."

I was told to be at their office at the River city Mall @ 6:45 a.m. I was there on schedule. I had done a walk in reservation and did not pay a single penny before i embarked on this tour. Our Guide for the day was Andy and she was really good at briefing us. We were a ver small group if 7 people. The bikes provided were of decent quality and no frills attached. We first rode into China town and stopped at the Chinese Flower market. On the way we passed through narrow alleys and back roads of Bangkok which one would probably never see in any other tour. We stopped over for 15 minutes in the market and were able to roam around and take pictures and enjoy the sights. We then left for the crossing over to the west side on a local ferry which took about 10 minutes. We were then on the road again and were riding into the back alleys and the fields on the outskirts of Bangkok city. The scenery is worthwhile so are the smells and sounds. after riding for about an 30 minutes we were taken to a small mom and pops restaurant for a meal [brunch] the food was delicious and they even accommodated my Vegan request. Post brunch and a short ride later we were on the boat again for our ride back into the city on a boat.total trip time is about 5 hours approximately. If you love riding bikes and like seeing the flip side of any city then I would recommend this.Andy the guide / leader was really great. She keeps one and all very entertained. I think even kids can do this trip. Its a great activity for a family. Ample food and water was provided. Andy was also good at stopping at proper rest areas so people could use the facilities."

People were extremely friendly, many would wave at us, kids would show off their diving/jumping into the river skills. We saw how they used the river for washing themselves, laundry, dish washing. Lots of water spinach grown by the side of homes. We did stop at a beautiful Wat and our lovely guide Audrey explained some of the customs and protocols of visiting a temple. The boat rides were good fun although we were a bit sun burned and wind blown by the end. Water and snacks were provided by Audrey along the way as well as toilet breaks.I wish we felt more confident cycling as I would have preferred to have gone on a combo tour with them.

If you are from the UK or similar then you have no business being on a bike, in this humidity, in the heat, in a crazy city like Bangkok. On the flip side, if you don't do all of the above you are crazy. This cycling tour of Bangkok was one of the worst and best things I've ever done. Worst because of the 6am start, the heat, the smells (wait till you see where they take you) and the hard toil of cycling about. Best, because we got taken down the narrowest alleys, between peoples homes, through people's businesses, down into the underbelly of the REAL Bangkok. The place were incredibly poor people do what they can with what they can and smile, wave, say hello and generally make you feel like every woe you ever thought you had in your life was just plain dumb!

A great way to discover the hidden places in Bangkok: on a bicycle you discover all elements of the city: markets, tiny streets teeming with people, cats and dogs and everything that is sold on the streets. Extremely busy and noisy, but so much fun! You also see the more rural part of the city, quiet and green, with fields with all kinds of vegetables and herbs. Take the 5 hour tour, with a combi of boat and bike, and lunch included. Simply fantastic to experience!"

It is also the best \"tours\" we have ever done. The tour takes you all over Bangkok. We stopped at Temples, Muay Thai rings, Huge markets, neighborhoods, small restaurants. We had so much fun. You need to be at least a mid level bicycle rider. It is not a physically difficult ride, but you will be squeezing through some tight places and making sharp turns. This tour is a must do while in Bangkok."

We started riding in back alleys, narrow streets and sidewalks making sharp turns and avoiding obstacles. Crossing busy streets, they had one staff member stop traffic for all of us to cross. We had 3 staff people for 8 riders. We took our bikes on a train ride to the country, on the subway and a klong boat. They were always stopping to get us soft drinks and bathroom stops. We ate lunch at a lovely outdoor restaurant with some of the best food I had in Thailand. This trip is not about exercise. It's going at a slow pace of coasting along. It's just about being at a relaxed pace and enjoying the day. The worst part was we waited 45 min for the train to leave to take us to the countryside and about a 45 min train ride. The narrow path along the canal took concentration. One person fell in. My finger got caught in the subway door (last person with their bicycle on). We saw an unusual Chinese temple. The whole trip was highly enjoyable but not for the faint of heart."

On our tour there were only 6 people booked and two of them did not turn up. We did wait as long as possible for them but this did not make us take off late and loose time on our tour. Our guide was very pleasant and the route chosen through China Town and then over the river to Thonburi was magical. The snack announced on the trip programm was in fact a hot meal taken in a street restaurant. This was a pleasant surprise. We very much enjoyed the fabulous atmosphere of Bangkok by night. Chinatown was like being transported back to 19th century China. Amazing.The only thing that stopped me from giving a full excellent evaluation is that our guide could improve a little on English (but her motivation did make up for that) and we would have appreciated more short stops for taking photos. It is very difficult to take photos of the tiny alleyways in Chinatown while cycling. We do recommend the tour and will probably go back there!"

We cycled around China Town, through markets, through temples. We took the train out of the main city and into the area which consists of canal and narrow, raised concrete walkways. Cycled through the walkways, under bridges, into a school, played volleyball with the school kids. Fed the HUGE catfish at the temple. Loaded the bikes onto a longtail, rode through Bangkok as the sun was setting.   Really, REALLY great day out. Highly recommended."

I will be recommending this trip to everybody, not only tourists who are visiting but also my friends who live in the city, its a great day out.Thanks to all the team at Co van Kessel for a wonderful experience and I will for sure be back to enjoy another tour sometime soon."

Bangkok is a hard city to get to know at first because the main downtown public spaces are built for cars and not people (think Downtown Miami). This tour gets you off the massive roadways and into the dense, colorful back neighborhoods. It takes you to places you would never ever go and it's awesome. You get to see the real city.I have been living in Bangkok for several months, and when my tourist friends ask me what they should see and do in Bangkok, they immediately get a text message: \"CO VAN KESSEL BIKE TOUR!!!\" A dozen or so friends have taken this tour at my urging and all have loved it. Most of said it was the favorite part of their entire SE Asia tour. It's that amazing. The tour is very easy physically and enjoyable for cyclists of all ages and abilities."

I agree with some of the previous comments, that the guide doesn't talk with you when cycling from A to B, tell you where you are, history about the areas but in all honesty, it would make the tour longer, you would stop often and it would make the tour less fun! I loved cycling through the narrow alleyways, down oneway streets, by the side of the river where my friend decided to wrestle with a tree (and she lost...! p.s. it was great that we stumbled across another group when she fell as the tour guide of the other group carried a first aid kit which was needed!) you truly do see how the real Bangkok people live! I saw parts of the city which I would never venture out to see or go down such narrow alleyways had I not been on this tour. We were a group of 9 so it was nicely sized, some people on our group were not so experienced riders and we always felt safe even if you were the straggler. Our guide Bak Soi was a great character and kept us interested at the few stops we made at temples! All in all, it was a fab day and we all enjoyed it! Looking for our next tour already! :) Thank you Co Van Kessel!"

It was our first trip together outside India and were very excited, with a lot of expectations! One of the biggest apprehensions, for a first timer, is, of course, How, What and Where do we tour in a new city?! But, a BIG THANK YOU to Co Van Kessel Tours (and my friend Prakyath, for booking the tour) for that!!! We had the time of our lives cycling through the suburbs of Bangkok. We had booked for the cycling cum boat tour. It started at 1300 hrs from the Co Van Kessel office in Rivercity mall and lasted for about 5 hours. We cycled through the busy market area called 'Something' in Chinatown and also the beautiful Flower market. After which we stopped for a delicious Thai lunch. We then continued our journey on a 45 min boat ride, which allows you to rest those aching thighs. The highlight of the tour was the ride through the suburbs and interiors of the city. It shows you the REAL lifestyle of the locals! And, before we knew it the tour came to an end! Our Guides, Ms. Waters and Mr. Dee, were amazing!! They added to the excitement of the tour! :)It was one of the most memorable holidays and I would love to go back only to try another one of their tours!!

Although we were athletic enough to take it up a notch, he made sure to keep a pace that the entire group could keep up with. He brought us to temples, through alleyways and across busy streets - all safely.

They took very well care of everything and everybody, the whole trip I felt very safe.I did the 9 hour tour and was very pleased with it: we started to cycle through small alleys in Chinatown, very beautiful (smell, sights, people). Then we took a train for 45 minutes to get to the outdoor areas of Bangkok (we went to the East). Wow wow wow!! Very beautiful, rice fields, water, green everywhere and all the people in the villages we went through were very nice. Having a wonderful lunch (we could eat as much as we wanted), started to cycle to a temple. After that took a small boat and our bikes on it, again awesome. At the end we took the skytrain and cycled to Co van Kessel again. They bring enough drinks for everybody!Conclusion: Wonderful tour, glad I did the whole 9 hour tour, the wind will keep you cool, a beautiful sight of Bangkok you will see. Just do it!"

Just a 2 of us team we got Patti and Nam to guide us (lucky ratio). I wasn't a great bike-rider myself (been over 7 years away from bike). the quiet city traffic during Songkran and having 2 lovely guides were the best combo.Love the service, exploring BKK from a totally different perspective. Explored Chinatown, both sides of Chao Praya River and saw some beautiful architectures from different religions and neighbourhood. Plus a great hangover cure with good quality bike gear. Will recommend this to anyone."

When you have limited time, and still want to get the best possible impression of the real life in inner city Bangkok / Chinatown / Thai town, then I can highly recommend the various bicycle / boat tours organised by Co van Kessel's team. The perfect way to get an insight in its narrow, but very lively small streets and allies, full of colours and (often very nice, sometimes not so nice) smells and crowded with mostly very friendly people. These people are busy doing all kinds of stuff, like repairing completely worn out motor engines, cooking for erveryone who wants to buy some very enjoyable food for almost nothing, or putting together flowers to serve as offers in the numerous Buddha temples and places etc etc. Unlike e.g. Amsterdam, where the locals would take you off your bikes when you bother them too much, the Thai people remain friendly and smiling towards these interfering tourists. I would definitely recommend to e.g. take the 5 hour bikeride combined with the boat, which shows you the liveliness on the canals, the canal sides and some of the countryside of outer Bangkok. The tour guides may not know everything about the history, but they are 100% caring and committed to see everybody safely back home gain. The food and beverage underway is splendid as well. One of the best things we did in Bangkok in the last two weeks.."

The tour was rather nice, taking you through the very narrow streets of Chinatown and across the water. However, both guides were, although friendly, not real guides; they didn't share any information about the surroundings, lost (and retrieved) group members on several occasions, and worst of all: were constantly on the cell phone speaking Thai! All of that wouldn't matter if not for the price. A 3 hour tour was 900+ Thai Bath (25 euro's) per person. We were in a group of 10, that is a very quick 250 euro's for Thai standards. I suggest cutting the price in half and retraining your staff in being actually motivated to make their guests have a nice time!"

First of all, we really enjoyed our tour with our guides; Amy and Nuna ( hope i spell it correct).On their website, which is very clear about what to expect and think about, you can find the description about how to get to their office in Thai. If you don't speak Thai i highly recommend to print it and show to your taxi/tuk tuk driver. Nice touch to put this on the website!The tour itself starts with a route through small alleys and streets in Bangkok, including chinatown. After a short stop at a temple you cross the river with a ferry and continue on the other side. Eventually you will have a ride in a longboat which is a nice way to see some of the rural life in Bangkok from the water. You will also bike through the greener part with all kinds of plantations. After another longboat ride, a ferry and ofcourse more biking you get back to the main office.Overall i would definetly recommend this tour. If temperatures are expected to be high then i also recommend to take the early tour. You might have to wake up a bit early but it's worth it!"

Because we had an incredible nice day that time we booked the same 5-hour Bicycle/Boat Tour again. But this time things have changed. We were disappointed because our group was much larger than the first time. Three years ago their groups had a maximum size of 8 participants. Since then they changed their policy and they allow a lot more participants. This time we were with a group of 17 and (only) 2 guides from Co van Kessel. We also missed the ride through the narrow streets of Chinatown. This time we only stayed on the bigger streets, maybe because of the larger group. We love to bike through Bangkok and its surrounding areas. We would never do this on ourselves. We made a long boat trip to the outskirts of Bangkok and biked new roads and paths. But here we also missed the extreme small bicycle paths we did the first time. Our guide in front of the group (see pictures) sometimes stopped to explain things we saw along the road. But she started talking when the first participants arrived. By the time the last ones were there she has finished her story already. When they want to do the tours with large groups they should take care of this.We booked this tour with lunch included but half way we discovered we were in the group without lunch. This was not a big problem, we only became a little hungry, but the first time the lunch was one of the highlights of the trip. Despite the fact we love to bike in and around Bangkok we would not do this tour with them again."

I read somewhere that the bike/boat tour was great for all levels so the adventurous side of me decided to throw caution to the wind and try it. The tour begins in the very busy area of Chinatown, through really tight back alleys congested with vendors, tourists, dogs, scooters, women, children...you name it. There were a few stretches of of the bike tour that included wider, less congested paths but not many. The boat portions of the tour were a huge relief to me, very relaxing with great sights along the way. The bike portion back took us through a jungle-like area with more narrow paths & many turns but with a small drop-off on either side of the path that led into the water. I ended up walking my bike for a good portion of this trip. Although the tour took us through many picturesque sights, our particular tour leader was not very informative and didn't give us too many opportunities to stop along the way for photos. There was another staff member who stayed at the back of the pack and I was grateful for the fact that he was patient with me and stayed with me while the more advanced riders sped ahead."

CVK grouped us on a tour with other families \u2013 several kids on their own bicycles \u2013 which made for a great family atmosphere for our tour. Touring Bangkok on a bicycle is a novel way to experience this Amazing, Beautiful, Crazy, Dynamic, Ephemeral, Frantic, Gritty, Hectic, Intense, Jubilant, Kitschy, Lewd, Magical, Noisy, Orgasmic, Placid, Quaint, Resilient, Sultry, Tasty, Unique, Vivid, Wild, Xenophobic, Yearning, Zany city. If there is a better way to see and experience Bangkok, I have not found it and the folks at CVK do it right! The tour route mixes all that Bangkok has to offer \u2013 Khlong rides on the canals, Chinatown madness, Thonburi green spaces, wats, temples, and churches, a Thai market. The extraordinary thing about CVK\u2019s tours is that you get to be a part of the city and interact with ordinary Thais going about their normal business. All this without the hassles of Tuk-Tuk drivers and scammers! Along the way the CVK guides provide narration and refreshments: snacks, water, fruit, and a delicious all-you-can-eat meal. This is not just a bike tour it is a Khlong tour, a cultural experience that happens on a bicycle. If you do only one thing on your visit to Bangkok make sure it is a tour with CVK!"

We first bikes through the back allies of the inner city, seeing little markets, food stalls and the crammed living of the people living in Bangkok. After that, we took a long boat and had a great tour over the river to the more outer parts of Bangkok. There we saw the other way of Thais living. Very interesting. We then enjoyed a typical delicious Thaise lunch and went back by the long boat. The only disappointment was that we biked theough a lot of temples but we never went into one. I heard from people who did this tour before that they went into two temples.Overall, great tour with very friendly staff."

This sounded very strange to me: very hot, humid, and extremely polluting traffic. However, after having read dozens of reviews I was convinced to join a bicycle tour. Problem 2 was that I only had two days and I also wanted to do a canal tour, so when I saw that Co Van Kessel organized a bike-and-boat tour I was extremely interested and decided to give it a go.Booking this tour was very easy and I got an immediate confirmation. Payment is only after the tour. I arrived on time at the China Princess Hotel (in Chinatown) and pleasantly saw that I was the only Belgian in a group of Dutch tourists. The bikes are basic: no complaints about the brakes and saddle, but limited height. We left on time and first went through some alleys in Chinatown: unbelieving! Children playing, women cooking outside and shops everywhere. In fact it was very easy to go biking and I didn\u2019t really have any problems with the temperature and the traffic. After a few miles, we took a ferry to the other side of the river and after some additional kilometers we went on a long tail boat to discover the canals of Bangkok. We even ended up with our bikes near some outskirt farms. Later on, we went back through the canals with the long tail boat and enjoyed lunch near the finish. I would definitely book again with Co Van Kessel, a very reliable company that only uses small roads for your comfort. I did the morning tour, which is I believe easier than the afternoon tour (the temperature, you know\u2026).So if you really want a great bicycle, book with Co Van Kessel!"

What a great way to see Bangkok! The tour starts off at the Grand China hotel in Chinatown (very easy to find on Yaowarat Rd). The tour guides are very informative and pay close attention to every detail that makes this tour so successful. One guide leads the tour from the front of the group and an assistant rides in the back of the pack to make sure there are no accidents and that all riders are accounted for. Our tour took us initially through parts of Chinatown and we experienced the many sights, sounds, scents of what makes Bangkok such a special city. We encountered many local children whom were all charming and excited to greet us as we zoomed by. There are some areas where you have to be really careful on your bike, narrow alleys, bridges, the occasional local dog in your path that you have to avoid hitting. The pace of the tour is accomodating for everyones skill level so you don't feel like you will be left behind. There are plenty of water/rest breaks. The tour guides are great about interacting with the riders so everyone feels at ease and has a good time. You see some amazing sights on this tour. Really one of our top experiences in Bangkok!"

After leaving the busy traffic we got on a boat a went through the outskirts of Bangkok by bike and boat. At around 15:00 we had a tasty local lunch and some more cycling followed. We had regular drink and toilet stops.Overall a nice day. Do not expect any information from the guides, they just show you the way to go. We had group of 14 people with 2 guides. If you had any questions you could ask them, but it was mostly just cycling. But the good thing is that you go places you wouldn't go otherwise. And i liked the parts in the longtail boats, having a rest in the breeze. I would recommend this tour."

We are only 1,5 day in Bangkok, and wanted to have an idea about the real Bangkok. Thanks to our cycling trip we discovered a lot of places where tourists never go. We decided to go on trip 1, which takes 5 hours, and which includes two longtail boat trips. We changed our booking from the afternoon to the morning, and were very happy we did this. The morning tour starts at 7 and it is still cool in the morning hours. The group was not too big, which is good when cycling through very narrow streets and paths. They were very friendly, and the quality of the bikes was allright. They often stop for drinking and sightseeing, and it's an easy ride.Really a must do! Next time I'm in Bangkok, I'll try another of their tours."

We spent three hours navigating narrow residential alleys/corridors visiting markets and temples that all looked the same. Seriously, if you left the tour after the first 35 minutes you wouldn' have missed a single thing. The only people that had a clue as to why we stopped to look at something were the first 2 or 3 riders after the tour lead; everyone else was left in the dark. Again, in this tour it's not a big deal because you're only seeing markets and temples (of which we had already seen plenty of on our own). We just did 2 bicycle tours in Hoi An, Vietnam, and both were fantastic. Maybe we were expecting too much from Bangkok and Co Van Kessel Tours."

I booked the 9 hour trip, from the hotel starting point we weaved our way through narrow alleys around Chinatown to the train station where we caught a slow train out to a rural area somewhere out near the airport. So far okay then we find ourselves on these elevated pathways no more than 4 feet wide and elevated about 2 metres above water mostly both sides, I have never been so scared of falling in the water. What made things worse was to hear that at least five guides have done just that in the past. It really is not very safe and with motorbikes sharing the narrow path I felt ill most of the time we were on these paths. We visited a nice temple before taking a longtail boat through the canals back to the skytrain station. We had to carry our bikes up stairs and escallators and back down again which was a bit difficult. I never thought that I would be saying that the best part of the bike riding was on the busy streets of Bangkok. We stopped for drinks and had a lovely lunch all included. I ended the day battered and bruised and so tense that not even a massage helped."

The speed of cycling was up to us, enough stops in between with water / crisps and clean toilets. We have seen a Burmees football show (Takra), the sitting Budha, a cat lady and so much more.

The trip was very professionally run and the combination of biking in the city and a more rural area, and a long tail boat ride in the canals was a great mix. We opted for the lunch option which was delicious. My only warning is that you really need to feel comfortable on a bicycle. I think of myself as an experienced bicyclist having ridden several thousand miles, but I quickly realized that my experience was all relatively high speed on open roads. A lot of this biking is low speed in narrow alleys, markets and on narrow concrete walkways. The walkways are only 3 to 4 ft wide and the consequences of falling off are somewhat dire. If that makes you very nervous (like me) you should just take up the rear and walk your bike when things get dicey. I was amazed by how well the other participants (all Dutch) handled their bikes at slow speed!."

Our children were 3 and 5 years old at that time and they liked the tour too. This year we did the walking tour of 2 hours through Chinatown. We liked this tour too. It's a great way to see the ordinary life in Chinatown. We couldn't have done this on our own because you easily get lost in the small alleuys. And we didn't want that to hapen with our two children. The guide takes you through the mall alleys and shows you the real Cina town. Amazing!"

It was a unique experience to bike through the narrow streets of Chinatown, people waving and kids high-fiving at us. Seeing temples illuminated and crossing the river by boat and bridge. The guides were excellent, the tour organisation perfect. It is not cheap, but certainly worth the bahts! The tour requires good biking skills though! We were with an all-Dutch group, being used to bike in heavy traffic, it was no problem, but if you never rode a bike, don't start on this tour.... For me it was one of the highlights of my vacation in SE Asia!"

We did the morning tour because the temperature is better and the traffic is somewhat lesser when starting. Great tour, through parts of Bangkok never to be seen with other means of transport, through real life Chinatown and real life of Thai just outside of Bankok. The tw rides on long tail boats are interesting, going through the Klongs, but cycling there is even better. Good service (drinks etc.) on the way. Where ever you pass, people are friendly, are also a little bit puzzled about the strange (mainly Dutch) people on bikes. But waving and really friendly people everywhere.

Great ride and memory for the whole family. My kids will never forget the friendly Thai waving from every streetcorner. Having two blond sons also means that they need to be protected from Thai trying to toutch them all the time, but that's a downside I can digest. Try it, you'll love it."

Unfortunately my daughters bike didn't have working brakes and that, with the traffic (both pedestrian and vehicular) on the early part of the tour put her off, which ruined it a bit for my wife as well. It was our fault we should have checked the bike more carefully. One section was a little scary - riding on the hard shoulder of a busy road the 'wrong' way, but was no big deal for any experienced cyclist. Good food and drink stops, rests on the boats, friendly & happy guides. Got to see a whole different side to this great city! All in all we boys loved it!"

I have been to Bangkok numerous times before (this time was only a 3 night stopover) and wasn't particularly looking forward to the usual program of shopping and concrete walks. Due to our late arrival time I was unable to prebook my tour but the following day rang the office at 7.30am and successfully booked for the 9.00am full day tour on that day. Utilising four modes of transport (bicycle, longtail boat, local train and skytrain) who would have thought you could experience such a great and varied insight into the true Bangkok lifestyle. The frenetic sight, sounds and smells of the many local markets we cycled through was quite a contrast to the peace and serenity of the temples and mosques we cycled around.Cycling through neighbourhoods, small alleys, fresh markets and temples allowed you to get close to the local people and experience their lifestyle away from the usual tourist sites.There are plenty of drink, snack and restroom stops throughout the tour including an enjoyable lunch in a non-tourist restaurant. A great bonus of the tour was that all drinks, snacks and lunch were included in the price so that you only needed to take your camera with you.On the occasions where we had to cross a busy road I was amazed at the power of the yellow caps waved by Amy and Mr Ahm that stopped the flow of traffic to allow our 9 cyclists to safely negotiate the road!This is a perfect way to see Bangkok away from the usual tourist haunts. My only disappointment was that my wife (a non-cyclist) didn't get to enjoy the wonderful experience I had with a very professionally run company.On my next trip to Bangkok the first thing I will be booking is another tour with Co van Kessel Bangkok Tours."

After an early start shuttle service pickup from our hotel, my wife and I met with our two lovely tour guides Audrey and Bobo at the Grand China Princess Hotel for 7am departure on the Chinatown and Gardens of Siam Tour. A quick orientation of the bikes, and then into the real Chinatown for a fascinating ride through the streets and narrow laneways, and close mixing with the locals as they go about their daily activities. Biking through this area was exciting and hectic, particularly the crossing of the streets, but the guides made sure everyone was safe along the way. Local ferry across the river, and we entered a slightly slower area and stopped at a local market, which was great to see. A long tail boat ride (with bikes) took us along the canals to rural areas, where we rode amongst local houses and gardens. As indicated by others, the concrete pathways are raised above the ground, and are fairly narrow to navigate without a good bike. This leads to our only complaint, being the women's bikes which have only one gear. This makes them hard to handle in the narrow Chinatown laneways and the raised rural pathways. The operators need to provide new geared bikes for women, similar to what are available to men. We stopped for a top quality authentic thai meal at a local restaurant, and then via another long tail boat ride back to our starting point. In all, I have no hesitation in recommending this bike tour so you experience the true sounds, smells and vision of the real Bangkok and nearby rural areas. Thanks to Audrey and Bobo for providing this very interesting and careful tour."

Then choose the bicycle in the parking of the hotel and off you go. First explore the maze of Chinatown, amazing how they got to know this routing and find their way through small alleys, fresh markets and local temples. Then the bikes are put on a boat to the outskirts of Bangkok. A huge difference in just a small distance. Outside of the concrete jungle is a beautiful green area with fresh air. Biking here is pleasant, no traffic and a relaxing speed. Plenty of time to see the surroundings and take some pictures. I found bicycling one of the best ways to get close to the local people and see their local lifestyle. Further regular stops are made to refresh yourself with a cool bottle of water.

            "review": "Bangkok Bike tour. The bike trip consists of a ride through Chinatown and around Bangkok. This is a fairly easy ride, you don't go very fast (because you never really can) and there are lots of stops. We went to two different temples, one Chinese and another Thai. There are also a few long boat rides. The include water and a drink in the trip, you'll need the water as it is very HOT.Chinatown was neat but the streets are narrow and there are a lot of really sharp, short turns. When we were outside of China town it was fun, we went to a small floating market. The paths were narrow and sometimes had dangerous drop offs.All in all it was a very cool experience, we saw a lot of stuff you wouldn't see on the tourist trail. The guides were nice and spoke good english. I would suggest you check out your bike before you leave on the ride, some are in better shape than others."

Angmo took my partner and I through Bangkok to see many sites and get a taste of true Bangkok culture. Angmo was amazing at explaining everything, she had an answer to every question I asked. We had a private van that had ice water and cold towels whenever we got back in which made it easy to brave the heat. Would definitely recommend Thai Sabai Life for any tour in Bangkok."

            "review": "Best Tour Guide in Bangkok!. My husband and had 2 days in Bangkok while on a cruise. After much research, we booked both days with Thai Sabai Life tours. The booking process was simple, communication was great, and payment was easy. When we arrived in port, our Guide, Tommy, met us as we disembarked and let us to a very comfortable private van with air conditioning, cold water, snacks and cold wet cloths when needed. We toured the flower and produce markets - incredible color and variety of flowers and food. We then visited the Wat Pho temple with the huge golden reclining buddha and the grand palace, took a canal ride, and had an amazing lunch with our guide. Leo, the driver, was terrific - he got us up close and was always there to pick us up when we were done. Note - his van was the best transportation we had on our two week cruise - the only way to tour Bangkok!The next day, Angmo met us at the port with Leo and the van. During the hour long drive out to the markets, Angmo told us about Thai history, the current king and his ancestors, and sang some songs about elephants and the name of Bangkok - one very long word. She also stopped at a traditional Thai house to show us how Thai people lived - simple and beautiful, open teak wood rooms that were cool and comfortable. Our first market stop was the Train Market, where the train moves through a very tight space and the vendors pick up their goods to let it pass - unfortunately the train was not running, but it is still a fascinating place to see. On the way back to the van, Angmo bought some pork satay from a street vendor, and we ate it on our way to the Damnoen Saduak floating market; she assured us that the food was fine, which it was, not to mention incredibly tasty! When we reached the market, we boarded a longtail canoe and went into the market. It was quite an experience, bargaining with people from the boat. Angmo gave us some tips before we left the dock, which made the experience a little less intimidating. At the end of the floating market, there are additional stalls on dry land, with some beautiful textiles and ceramics. Angmo bought us some cold drinks, and took some pictures of us. On the way back, we stopped for lunch at a small restaurant that served up some delicious Thai food, then we stopped at an elephant ride place - we did not want to ride, but I wanted to see the elephants up close. She took us to a place where we could feed them bananas and touch them - exactly what I was hoping for. As we were heading back, we asked if she could take us somewhere to purchase a USB drive to back up our pictures; she drove us to a large department store, helped us find the electronics section, translated our needs and questions to the store employee, and helped us check out. Not something most tour guides would take the time to do! We then headed back to the city, and tried to get to the Jim Thompson House, but the roads were blocked by a bicycle race, so we went back to the port. I can't say enough about this tour. We booked a two day 'custom' tour; we told them what we wanted to see and they arranged for us to see it all and then some. They were prompt, helpful, never pushed for time, provided luxurious and comfortable transportation, filled up the drive time with education and conversation, were attentive to our needs and wants, and made sure that we had exactly the visit that we had envisioned. Angmo was delightful - professional, sincere, knowledgeable, and fun; the perfect tour guide, and the best we have ever met. Tommy, our guide for the first day, and Leo, our driver for both days, were also professional and fun to be with. We would highly recommend their services - and suggest that you should book early if you want Angmo - she is in high demand, and worth the wait!"

They picked us up at Laem Chabang port (as well as taking us back the next day). We decided not to do the ship's excursion and because our time was so limited (1.5 days), we wanted to be able to set our own itinerary and not the cookie-cutter tours that the ship offers. We ended up inviting 2 people from the ship to join us so it ended up being 4 rather than 2 and there was a slight charge ($30pp per day) but I was fine with that for a last minute change in our agreed upon # of persons and plans.Admittedly, we didn't have too much time for research but we had a general idea of what we wanted to see but not a fully planned agenda so we just sort of made it up as we went along. We had Tommy as a tour guide and we had the best time! Tommy was great and was so informative and had the best ideas on where to take us. I'm certain I'll miss some places but we went to all of the Temples, reclining Buddha, and Grand Palace, took a long tail boat along the river, had the BEST lunch at a local restaurant (not touristy at all!), walked around local markets, went to 2 floating markets, a local farmer's market that lead out to another market on the railroad tracks (SO COOL!). We'd planned to go to Chinatown but timing-wise by the time we were going, they were closing for a break and Tommy offered to come back to our hotel a few hours later to take us back but we told him we could go on our own (he was so sweet and accommodating to offer!) Tommy gave us tips for navigating while we were on our own that were really useful. He was a such an excellent guide!!! They provided water, cold towels, and snacks along the way. Their mini bus was wonderfully air-conditioned, well-equipped, and really comfortable. The driver was also really nice and navigated his way around all areas really well. We never had to wait for him upon pickup. Dealing with Olaf through the reservation process was also really easy and he was very knowledgeable and thorough with his advice. Without hesitation, I would recommend using Thai Sabai and Tommy as a guide!. Thank you so much for making our time in Bangkok so WONDERFUL!"

From the start, months before our trip, Angmo and Olaf were in touch to make sure the dates we wanted were available and that our tour would include everything we wanted to see. Our guide, Tommy, was fabulous. Our focus was on the countryside outside of Bangkok, and he oriented us well to the district we headed to. We spent the day in an orchard, trying all kinds of fruits; and on a long tail boat going to a lotus and an orchid farm. It happened that we had some overlap in plans (two of our tours were to include the Grand Palace and we had already seen it by the time Tommy picked us up), so he skillfully shifted the itinerary around to drop it and something else. The highlight though was going to the local market, where Tommy suggested many kinds of delicious sweets to try and took us to the best meal we've had so far in Thailand: lunch at a local place in the market. We were surrounded by Thai families out for Sunday lunch and shopping, and eating incredible food, and chatting like friends spending the day together about travel experiences, favorite TV shows, etc. Tommy also gave us some great tips and advice on smoothly transitioning to other cities on our tour, which we greatly appreciated. The van was clean, comfortable, and cool and our driver friendly and helpful.Afterward, Angmo followed up to make sure we had been ok with the itinerary and that our day was a good one.

Our driver also was very attentive and drove us resp. picked us up wherever we wanted and moreover provided us with fresh drinks and refreshing tissues at any time. This tour is more than recommendable and more than worth the money. Although, home again, we are somewhat still caught in this extraordinary trip."

We just got home from our extended trip to Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Korea that included a river cruise on the Mekong River.Our day tour with Angmo and driver Leo were truly one of the highlights of our trip. As we were in Bangkok for two days already prior to joining Angmo, we asked to be taken outside the city. We were driven in Leo's luxury van :) to a local market stationed alongside a railroad track, where we were the only non-locals, it appeared. Very colorful and unusual. We also went to the famous floating market where we toured it by long-tail boat, which got us truly into the middle of the action, rather than just wandering the stalls onshore. My favorite stop was at a tiger zoo, where we got up close and personal with a five-month old tiger cub, feeding it a bottle and lying on the floor with it. You can't do that just anywhere! Also we stopped at an elephant encounter where we fed the elephants bananas. Angmo treated us to various local snacks along the way, and dropped us off at a neighborhood restaurant for local food for lunch. We also stopped at a teak workshop, local homes, and I am embarrassed to say it was such a full day that I can't remember the other stops. All along the way we were provided cool towels and cold water upon returning to the van. Also informative and interesting cultural background. Thank you, Angmo and Leo, for making our trip so memorable."

My wife and I have taken many private tours over the years of travel, and this one experience with ThaiSabai in my opinion ranks as the top guided tours of Bangkok, an absolute excellent experience. Our guide, Angmo, is very knowledgeable of Thai history, culture, and religion. That, combined with an exuberant personality, made this a unique experience. In my opinion, it is matter of time before ThaiSabai will be ranked at the top of private Bangkok tours. My wife and I would not hesitate to use her for any future trips to Bangkok. We did quite a bit of research on private guides in Bangkok, and were very happy to have found someone with such knowledge, integrity, professionalism and excellent English."

Angmo picked us up from our hotel at 9AM (actually the front desk informed us that she was already there earlier so she was incredibly punctual!) and the fun didn't stop all day.We were in an amazing van that was over the top swanky and very comfortable. She gifted each of us in our group with a special souvenir and learned all of our names immediately! Right off the bat, Angmo started giving us history and culture lessons about Thailand. She had informational posters about the royal line and the Thai alphabet. Our first stop was the Grand Palace. We spent time in the Queen's Museum and then saw the rest of the grounds. Angmo told us all the history and information about what we were experiencing. She added a depth to our time at the Palace that we couldn't have experienced otherwise. (We actually had some people trying to tag along to our tour and hear all that Angmo was telling us but Angmo handled them perfectly!) Next, we went to the 24 hour flower markets. Angmo continued to regale us with history, traditions, and facts as we walked around this vibrant area of Bangkok. She also got us all delicious fried chicken, Thai iced coffee, and a mini crepe type of dish so we had an experience of authentic street food. After this, we stopped for lunch. We went to a restaurant that seemed to cater specifically to tourists BUT don't worry, the Thai food was definitely authentic and incredible. We were on the waterfront and had time to relax before our next experience- a \"James Bond\" boat ride. We boarded our boat and took off after lunch. Wow- this was incredible! We got to see the city from a different angle and enjoyed being on the water. Then, we hit some street markets to do last minute souvenir shopping and then we saw the amazing Royal Temple which is home to the reclining Buddha. Again, Angmo faithfully informed us of the history and facts of everything we were seeing and doing. We were so sad when our time together came to an end, but on our ride home Angmo continued to tell us even more about Bangkok, history, jokes, etc. She told us about our day of the week Buddha and gave us each a parting gift. This tour was a highlight of my time spent in Thailand. Our group learned more about Bangkok than I ever thought possible! I highly highly recommend this tour and if you have more than one day, take advantage and book a two or three day tour. More pros:Angmo was energetic, kind, and incredibly knowledgeable and professional. On top of all that, she was also very sensitive to our group's needs. One member of our group wasn't as mobile as the rest of us, and she made sure she was well taken care of. Angmo also made sure we got to stop and shop which was a special request. She seemed well-known and in the loop everywhere we went, so we felt as though we got special treatment.After every stop, our driver gave us waters and wet wipes to cool off and clean up! The pace and activities of the day were perfectly spaced and planned. We really had a five star experience. And, this trip was very reasonably priced. Do yourself a favor and see this city the right way!!! Book a tour with Thai Sabai Life. You won't regret it."

We spent a fabulous day visiting many highlights around Bangkok as well as enjoying a thai lunch in a local restaurant. We decided to go back to the ship for the night, however another option is to stay in Bangkok overnight.Day 2 we headed out to an elephant camp in Pattaya, where we got to ride elephants and Angmo taught us the \"Elephants Song\". We enjoyed another wonderful Thai lunch, this time at a seafood restaurant on the beach.I would highly recommend Angmo to show you around her beautiful country.

Then she plans out the day to meet and exceed your desires. We hit the Grand Palace, Markets, River Tours, Wat Pho, more markets, and a tour around the City all in our private transportation van. There is still more that we wanted to see; but did not have the time due to our own schedules. If we were on our own, we would not have been able to see much of the above.

And all that combined with deep knowledge about history and monuments You do visit.Angmo is rising bar so high, that from now on any tour guide we will use (and used so far) in other cities will be compared to Angmo and - unfortunately - I would guess very few if any will match Angmo.During our trip Angmo even managed to learn some Lithuanian words surprising how fast she can manage it (and - shame on us - we were much worst on learning Thai :) ). We have had big fun singing together Thai and Lithuanian songs when in van - looks like our quite \"Nordic\" and reserved character was really softened by warmth of Angmo.Really best experience and best way to learn Bangkok or entire Thailand. 100% recommended."

This tour was worth every penny!Olaf was responsive and easy to contact on email, and Angmo was the perfect tour guide. We enjoyed every minute of the tour with her. As the other reviews have indicated, we found her to be knowledgeable, enthusiastic, personable, flexible, friendly, and well prepared. All of the arrangements from the comfortable cushy van to the stops we made during the day at the market for traditional Thai coffee and tea, to the temples, museums, and lunch at the restaurant complete with a dessert of local fruits picked up at the market earlier in the day were first class. The cold water and towels stocked in the van, along with our driver (never had to wait for the van) were welcome respites from the Bangkok heat.Angmo took many pictures with our phones, and her own phone - and later emailed them to us. She seems to know everything and everyone - we learned so much about Thai culture and the temples. Angmo was fun to be with and her English was really excellent.

Given that we had a fixed schedule and would be traveling with some luggage, we needed a company that could provide flexibility in the schedule and also provide us with a vehicle where we could stow our luggage during our tour. Thai Sabai Life was one of the few companies that agreed to willingly provide us with this accommodation. Further, they were able to communicate with ease in English and also provided total flexibility in the itinerary, allowingus to select the exact places of interest to visit, while also offering helpful advice in planning the itinerary. They were highly responsive to email and it was a pleasure communicating with them to plan the trip. They linked us with Mr. Nikoon for our tour, who was patiently waiting for us at the predetermined location upon our arrival at the airport. As promised, our air conditioned van was waiting for us, which was a lifesaver given the heat outside. This allowed us to travel to multiple spots throughout the day without suffering from heat exhaustion. Mr. Nikoon provided insightful guiding throughout the day and was a pleasure to have as our guide. With ease,he took us from site to site, ensuring both our safety and caring for all necessary logistical details. Perhaps the most impressive aspect was his ability to seamlessly negotiate the timing and length of our visit at each site to ensure that we got to visit all of our points of interest within our limited time frame (so that we could get to the airport in time for our flight). I felt we were in very good hands with Mr. Nikoon and he took care of any possible need we had throughout the day. A special great thanks to Olaf and Angmo for their outstanding handling of the planning of the trip/itinerary. I would highly recommend their guides and company for a visit to Bangkok!"

Not only the highlights we asked for but also including the small streets behind the temples, where everyday bangkok life is visible. Which was superb to experience, we had lunch at a small, nice and excellent china town restaurant and as we enjoyed the city our guide told us interesting facts, history and stories about our surroundings. We spoke with locals and strolled through the small alleys. Our guide was open for any suggestion and even my son of 14 loved the relaxed way the tour was organized. Relaxed even though we saw so much of Bangkok at the same time.By tuk tuk and boattrips on the amazing bangkok river we visited local markets but also the wonderful amulet market and ofcourse buzzing chinatown. Our guide helped us pick the right food stalls to eat local snacks, loved it!Still feeling a little bit homesick, wanna go back soon!Thanx Thai Sabai Life for showing me the real Bangkok!"

She was extremely accommodating and very flexible in organization our tour. Angno looked after all our needs, from providing cold water and towels, to looking after entry fees, to taking pictures, to making entertainment bookings, and even providing us with a personal memento of the trip. Bangkok is an incredible city and we were indeed fortunate to have such a great guide to enhance our enjoyment of the city. Furthermore transportation was provided by a luxury van. We were a group of 3 couples who toured with Angmo in Bangkok. Some words to describe Angmo are: attentive, energetic, knowledgeable, conscientious, intelligent, enthusiastic, considerate, adaptable, fun-filled, and humorous. We saw many sites and thoroughly enjoyed our private tour. From all of us, thank you so much!"

My daughter wanted a custom tour to Bangkok so she looked up \"tours by locals\" and found a lady name Angmo. We told her we didn't want a tour of temples and stated what all we wanted to see. She picked us up at our hotel in an air-conditioned custom van. We were able to see everything we wanted and only visited two temples. They knew how to get around and planned our trip accordingly. I love green coconut drinks but didn't care to risk getting sick. Angmo knew where to get us the drinks and even street food that were safe for foreigners. Thai coffee at the flower market beats any coffee we have ever tasted. She and the driver went way above and beyond to accommodate our wants and schedule. If I have more time and space I would recount to you how amazing this team was to us. Traffic in Bangkok is terrible, getting to all the sights by public transport is not possible and taxi gets stuck in traffic for a long time. If I have to do it again I would definitely go with \"tours by locals\" in general and with Angmo and her driver specifically."

We went to all the best Bangkok attractions and she was very knowledgable about Thai history and culture. We were constantly surprised with little treats like mouth-watering street food snacks, locally produced Thai coffee, and local fruit and flowers from the fresh market. She helped us find the best deals in the floating market and took us to reasonably priced restaurants with some of the most delicious Thai food I've ever eaten! Her customer service far exceeded our expectations and her driver was always courteous and helpful as well. We highly recommend this tour company should you ever find yourself in Thailand. These custom tours are better than large organized group tours and she offers tours anywhere in Thailand! I would definitely contact her again if I return to Thailand."

We had arranged for a driver to pick us up at the airport and take us to our hotel the first night and then the city tour with Temples and Palaces and then we were heading out of Bangkok to visit the floating markets and other cultural highlights. We met Angmo in the lobby of the Renaissance hotel where we stayed at 9am on the first day. From this moment on we felt like we were being given a tour by a close family member who just happened to know everything about Bangkok, Thailand, Buddhism and any other topic we asked about. We loved all the personal touches. Also not having to figure out how much Baht to carry was very helpful and helped relieve some of my wifes anxiety. Angmo pays for everything and you just pay her back at the end of the tour. It was also nice to have her taking pictures of us as a couple. Many times i look back at the photos from a vacation and it is like I'm not even there. This time I received an email from Angmo on my arrival home with many pictures of us as a couple and even a few sneaky pictures taken when we were just enjoying the scenery. We enjoyed meeting many Thai people who seemed to enjoy talking with us and sharing their culture. In the title of my review I say that this was the best tour ever. I say this after many countless tours. i have now been to 34 countries and most of the states in the US. (I;m a traveling consultant.) Never have I felt so comfortable and informed on a tour. Don;t even ask me about the food. Heaven."

I looked at and contacted quite a few companies, but by far the best communication came from Olaf (Tours with Tong-what a waste of time!). He allowed us to tailor make the tour to what we wanted which was perfect. It probably was a little more expensive than some of the others, but I thought it was worth very penny (or baht!). Amour, the guide, was excellent - she was very knowledgable and helpful and took lots of photos of us, which she emailed us and even give us a few gifts too! The driver was excellent too and we felt very safe. Cannot recommend this couple enough - don't hesitate, just book them!"

            "review": "Fun and Educational. Used Angmo's service thrice on two separate Bangkok family trips. She was a great hit with both sides of our family. Everyone just adored her. She's very flexible with scheduling and will do everything to accommodate her group. Even the packaged tour can be tailor-fit to whatever itinerary would best suit. Case in point: during our last trip, the heat was just atrocious, making us reluctant to proceed with the China Town walking tour part of our package. Instead, Angmo helped most of our party schedule traditional Thai massage sessions at Wat Pho (the centuries old Thai Massage school), while bringing myself and my husband to a nice cool mall where we could relax and shop.Touring with Angmo is as relaxed or exciting as you want it to be. She knows when to leave us time to rest and when to give us interesting insights into Thai history and nuances of Thai culture. Her tours are also pretty luxurious for the reasonable price she charges. The comfortable air-conditioned vehicles, cold towels, and iced water she provides as part of the tours is definitely heaven-sent after each trek in the tropical climate. The free snacks and assistance in shopping at the markets is another of the highlights of Angmo's service. My husband still craves for the sweet roti she treated us to in Ayutthaya. We started out booking a tour guide, but left Bangkok having gained a friend."

We booked her for a trip to Khao Yai park north of Bangkok for three days. We were greeted at the airport by this woman with a massive smile who led us to an absolutely luxurious and spacious van. At stops along the way there she would buy us the local food and explain it to us and other Thai customs. She is very friendly and gracious and her English is flawless. She made our trip memorable and she also made sure we got the best park guide when we hiked through the bush. In all, if you are looking for a guide in Bangkok or the surrounding areas (she might go to other parts of Thailand too) I would highly recommend her."

I've toured in England, Finland, France, Spain, Vietnam and all over the US and I couldn't believe how much fun this was. Such a great value for the amount of attention and information you get.Hands down - the very best way to see the city is to book with Thai Sabai Life. Angmo listens to what you want to do, makes recommendations to make the most of your time and really shows you the real Thailand. You get a better understanding of the people and culture. My tour was a half day city tour of the main highlights of Bangkok and an afternoon shopping tour to pick up all kinds of crazy things for my friends and family. I had a list a mile long of things I wanted to see, eat and buy. OMG - we covered everything!! I even got to sleep in late?! We were able to zip along from place to place in a huge, air-conditioned mini-van that was really plush inside. I always had water and wet towels to cool off which was appreciated. Angmo was also a great photographer - snapping shots of those great moments I would've forgotten about later. She was thoughtful, always finding me things to snack on (cause I seriously love eating my way through countries) and she was funny -- always sharing background stories on the history of her people and telling jokes -- which caused us to burst out laughing in the middle of Wat Pho!I was blessed with Holy Water, paid my respects to Buddha, took amazing pictures with the monks and even silly pictures with a statue of Ronald McDonald. Anything I wanted to do, no matter how silly or crazy it sounded - Angmo was up for it. Her energy stayed high and when the sun was a bit too much, we would duck into a coffee shop or pop back into the van to cool off.She even presented a little Tuk Tuk keychain as a souvenir since I mentioned I liked them so much. The little thoughtful things were amazing and I felt like I was touring Bangkok with my sister. Thai Sabai Life tours is A+++, Angmo and her driver (Mr. Ed!!) really deserve 6 stars and all I can say is don't wait, BOOK THEM RIGHT AWAY!!"

From the start, Angmo demonstrated the warmth and friendliness of Thailand with a huge smile and hug for my fianc\u00e9, whom she remembered from last year, and me. Angmo was prepared for every moment of our tour. She had handouts for us in the car and explained the meaning of the handouts, which always had something to do with Thai culture, history or religion. It made us feel like she put a lot of thought into how to keep her guests entertained and informed at all times. These moments were great ice breakers because they helped us get to know her better. Our actual tour with Angmo was fantastic. She introduced us to various methods of transportation, the history of each location and what it meant to the Thai people. We really appreciated how knowledgeable she was on culture, history and religion, and how she tied everything back to how proud she was of her country. By the end of the tour, we felt as if we had known Angmo a long time and the whole day was like spending it with an old friend. I can see why my fianc\u00e9e recommended we book our tour with Angmo. I would also recommend booking your tour with Angmo. She is the perfect person to introduce you to Thailand."

Angmor picked us up in the morning and drove us to the sites.

She knows very much about all this and took the time to answer our questions.It was very interesting and we are grateful that we learned so much and saw all those beautiful things. We received Buddhist Blessings and joined the prayers and gave donations at the temple. We felt like we experienced the Thail life a little more.

This was a wonderful experience encompassing not one, not two, but three boat rides and approx 45km of cycling. We saw villages, temples, a market, klongs, fields (yes fields!) and lots of wildlife (including a very large water monitor). Most of the route is away from traffic, with much of it being alongside klongs or through urban villages. A 40min boat ride up a klong took us to the countryside and a restaurant for lunch - with more cycling for dessert! This is truly a full day tour, and we were back at base by about 5:30pm - tired, but happy to have seen a completely different side of Bangkok! I fully recommend the organisation, and this tour - we would go again!! This would have been a 5 star review, aside from the following minor points (sorry RBB, we didn't put these on your form as these points came from our discussing after we left your office) - most importantly MORE WATER (this was our fault as the guide, Amm, asked us to shout if we wanted water and we didn't shout enough!! For reference, it was a hot day and we drank 5 small bottles - in hindsight we probably needed twice that), softer seats (one bike had a thin, hard, 'racer' style seat and after a full day in the saddle it was very unpleasant!), better hand grips (one bike had hard plastic hand grips with large diamond patterns cut into it - the sharp edges of this pattern resulted in blisters after a full day of riding). Don't let this put you off, as these were small things and the day was excellent.Finally, a 'shout out' for our guide Amm - who guided us safely through the tour, accommodated the different paces and abilities within our group, was knowledgeable and friendly.

Everything was well-planned and we had a great tour guide: Saen. He showed us places of Bangkok that we never would have seen as \"normal\" tourists. Very impressive. He took care of our security when we crossed the big roads, explained very well in a real good English all the things we visited. During the tour he served water and organised a real good dinner for us in a restaurant we would never have found on our own. In the temple he explained the basics of Buddhism which was very interesting. Do that tour with Saen and you will have a great experience of another side of Bangkok."

This company and the tour is well run by andre and dave - with dutch precision, attention to detail and great care - the long tail trips across the river provide a unique perspective - and biking in the green after a days in busy Bangkok center was good for the soul and spirit.if you want to see a \"different\" Bangkok and aren't afraid to get on a bike - this trip of you (well do it even if you are afraid to get on a bike - it is simply a must do experience - and you'll have a great little video to show your friends and family)"

Her english was very good and we could easily understand. The bikes are regular town bikes but they do the job and thankfully the terrain is all flat and easy to ride. It hardly felt like the 25km that it was. We cycle at home anyway, so were quite fit enough. I reckon a bit of fitness would go great lengths to make the afternoon more enjoyable. The narrow, raised paths in certain places all added to the sense of adventure and even though we rode through the traffic, we never felt unsafe. The office is not visible from the main street. When you get to the street number walk into the alley about 50+ meters to the end and it will be on your left. We would happily recommend this tour."

Altough you do 50K's it doesnt feel like it as you stop so often. Cycling around the canals and through the narrow streets, passing little shops and houses really shows you the real Bangkok. Our guide Amm was brilliant and gave us lots of info about Thai way of life, the temples, buddists and lots more. There was only myself and my wife on the tour so it made it even more personal. You also get to stop off at a little Thai restaurant where the food is really tasty Thai, cooked by locals and full of flavour and spice. From canal boat rides on small traditional boats, to river rides and cycling through city and country this tour ticked all the boxes for us.I can't recommend this tour enough, forget sitting on a bus and going to the usual tourist spots, do this for a real informative eye opening adventure.

Don't forget mosquito repellent and a hat! The tour also included a nice lunch break at a small eating place and drinks. Would recommend the private tour when you're joining with smaller children."

Definitely worth every penny we spent for this bike trip which brought us to places we never would have seen on our own. The guide was always checking to make sure we were close by and, if we wanted to stop and explore or catch our breath, he made sure we had time to do that. The bikes were fine and the paths that we followed required very little shifting since it was flat ground. All in all, a wonderful experience."

Each time we go to Bangkok, (usually to meet at a trade show) we make the time and book appx 15 of us for one of his tours. Last visit was in Oct. 2015! Tours are always well organized, fun, varied, and the guides are friendly and professional. Cant wait for our next visit to BKK to go on another fun bike ride with RBB.

Was when we got to walk through peaceful temples areas at night free of tourists? Was it when we had great diner at a \"Thai only\" restaurant? Was it when we discovered the flower market still full of life at night?Am was very knowledgable about Bangkok and Thai culture in general. He is a very interesting person to exchange with and has often a nice discreet humor.

A slow and authentic way of experiencing the country.If uncertain about doing the tour at beginning or end of your Thailand vacation: do it at the end - as you'll have some sun tan before, and will be exposed to some hours of sunshine on the bike.If uncertain about which length of tour you should choose: We did the half-day tour some years ago, which was excellent, but could easily have been longer, as we were so enthusiastic about all what we saw. So: at least go for a full-day tour. If you can somehow plan for a 2-day tour, it's definitely worth it: more to see, city and suburbs, a night market in the evening, locations you'd never get to see otherwise as a tourist. You should have biking experience, as a good portion of the bridge ways are a bit narrow, with water left and right.

The booking process was handled swiftly online and the confirmation processed within 24 hours. We had a great time exploring a different part of Bangkok and also the rural part of Samut Prakan. Our guide, Best, was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about showing us a different side to Bangkok. We enjoyed a walking tour followed by a Rickshaw ride through the streets. The Rickshaw ride gives you an opportunity to see into the daily lives of the inhabitants in the area. Soi dogs seem to enjoy watching the passing show as much as we enjoyed winding our way through the streets. Lunch is served at a Thai restaurant on the riverside. The food was delicious and our vegetarian visitors were well catered for. After lunch we took at short walk through the market area and then headed pack to the pier to catch the boat to the end of our tour.

He explained a lot about the life in Bangkok. We can recommend this tour to everyone!"

He guided us safely through Bangkok traffic which really takes a lot getting used to (especially the left handed traffic if you are from Germany). We visited interesting and often beautiful locations and enjoyed the best thai food I had the whole vacation. Since Amm was so good with the English language we could chat about the differences between our cultures and we learned a lot about Thailand in the process. If we had more time in Bangkok I would probably have taken other tours,too."

It's amazing that within such a short space of time you wouldn't even know the city existed. Our guide, Sao, gave us basic instructions at the start and we were off, meandering through busy city streets before getting in to the alleyways. The local people we saw along the way were friendly and offered a welcoming greeting. Sao stopped whenever we wanted to take a photo and also had s lot of local knowledge. The \"green lung\" of Bangkok was peaceful and the pathways over the swamps were great although it wouldn't be fun if you fell off! Lunch at a local restaurant was good before we headed back to the city. Recommendation- don't go on the weekend as the parks are crammed with people.Overall, this tour is really good value for money, is really well organised, and if all the guides are as good as Sao then you can't go wrong.We'll be back for sure!"

Rode through the back alleys and streets (even past an outdoor movie setup a couple of times!). We did have to do some riding on the main streets, which was a little harrowing, especially near the end of the tour at the flower market, which was very busy.. The local restaurant where we had dinner was really, really good. I would not recommend this tour for inexperienced or con-confident riders. Also, you are lifting heavy bikes over barriers and up and down stairs several times. We loved it, but it would NOT be for everyone. The temples we visited were nearly deserted, and had a wonderful peaceful vibe that is completely missing during the day. Amm and Tom were terrific and did a great job stopping traffic. Give this one a try if you're in good shape and a fairly confident biker. You'll see a totally different side of Bangkok. Thanks!"

The tour was called Colors of Damnoen-Saduak. We started with a coconut drink, then boarded a long boat to visit the floating market. Our guide bought us some sticky rice and mango with coconut milk. It was terrific!He showed us how every part of the coconut is used by the local people. Then we loaded up on bikes and rode through the palms. We stopped occasionally for explanations about village life, housing, etc. He kept us well supplied with water along the way. There was a nice breeze and we were shaded from the sun by the trees. Lunch was at Pailin River Terrace and it was WONDERFUL!! Really exquisite Thai food!After lunch we rode our bikes to see some temples in the area and headed to the car.

In many ways it was an OK tour for both our two children (10 and 12) as four adults. We did the Colors of Bangkok weekend edition. The pre-school on the way through \"the slum\" area was closed as it is every Saturday (suggest to take that out of the program). The floating marked is not really the floating marked I expected, but rather a normal marked with parts boardering some water, but do not expect the floating marked on the river with boats that one often sees in pictures. We did not sample any food there and our guide did not point out any local delicacies. The lunch was so so, when in Thailand why not have authentic Thai food, this was the most bland Pad Thai I ever had, even our children had to add some chilly powder. The Thai kick-boxing was also closed, it really is just a boxing ring, it is open on weekends in the morning and early afternoon, hence closed by the time you get to that part of the tour. Our guide did say we could take a photo in the boxing ring, but we did not want to wake up the 3 men sleeping in there. At least it was next to a kiosk selling ice cream as this would been one of the tour highlights for our boys. The salt factory which is mentioned in the program is premanently closed - again suggest that the program is revised. On our return trip across the river, we were one life vest short. Everyone from age 10 to full grown man were given same size vests, needless to say that the smaller people in our group would be in more danger using the oversized vests than none. Our guide was nice and kind, but not very informative. It would have been nice with a few bike instructions before the ride. Please note that front and back breaks are opposite compared to European hand breaks. We learned it the hard way! Also suggest that each participant is given a bottle of water to bring on the bike. As said there are many nice touches on this tour, but the low rating is based on the disappointments of the elements that were not there (despite in the program)."

The biking on the island is great but unless you are super confident you need to stop at each corner on the walkway or else risk falling off!! Practically two other points. 1. There is a lot of walking / getting on and off your bike owing to narrow paths. 2. Getting from the office to the boat pier can be nerve wracking as some of the cycling is on the main Rama 3 road. So I'd recommend only for older kids. Overall great to see parts of Bangkok not exposed to mass tourism. But not so great unless you super confident or don't mind getting on/ off your bike lots! "

What to expect:Engaging guide with great willingness to share history, culture and personal storiesPhotos - Amm took and shared about 30 photos during the tour which was wonderful. Even the Rickshaw driver know to overtake our other carts so we could each take photosVariety of environments from city suburbs to community living and the lungs of BangkokBest pad thai lunch Slow relaxing pace - nothing strenuous at allA market tour that explains the mysterious fruits and snacksGood quality well maintained bikesSome of the raised pathways are about 1.5 m wide so you do need a bit of bike control - or just go nice and slowIf you take the Rickshaw be ready to tip (your guide can advise on how much as we had no idea)The start point for our tour was about 30 mins from Khao San Rd so allow time and 120B taxi fare (if you can find a metered taxi).All in all a great trip, my only suggestions to improve would be more tastings at the market and perhaps to make the link between your tour and the support for the local kindergarden in the community more clear. These \"sustainable tourism\" models are very popular and more could be made of this.Thanks for a great day, great memories and showing us another side to Bangkok"

This was one of our favorite tours around Bangkok, when in need to get away from the busy bkk life and a little tired of the tuktuks and taxi's, take the bike to experience it from a whole other side, and get a totally different view from the town.Our tour guide, Aam, was very friendly and could practically answer all our questions ranging from culture, politics, nature and local habits. We took the 'Colours of Bangkok' Tour which started in the higher residential area, with a 10 min ride trough the heavy traffic, which was not evidently but due to the excellent guidelines and sign languages during the ride it went pretty well.After that the ride went along to much more bike friendly roads, trough the communities and then towards a little boat that took us to the 'jungle of Bangkok', which was absolutely amazing, biking on a small pathway surrounded by the beautifull nature, who could imagine there was such a lovely, relaxing place in bkk.We were offered a very tasty meal during the break, got drinks during the tour and a local snack.After the break we visited a temple and rode on trough the middleclass area, and visited the smallest kickboxing school in bkk. In other words, an interesting Tour with a lot of variation, Aam guided us excellently with all the information we wanted, and allthough Thai roads are not fully prepared for people who love biking, tis tour was fitted exactly to make it a bike-friendly experience.This was the perfect antidote to get away from the heavy traffic, overcrowded busses and boats, noise and smoke, and to enjoy the nature, people and culture in bkk, with the entire family! (Note: we took this with our two kids of 6 and 4, there was a smaller bike available for the oldest one and a very safe seat for the youngest, and they where all quality bikes).While at first, a little prejudice about riding a bike in big bkk, i now recommended it to everyone.The photos Aam took during the trip was also a very nice way to experience the ride once again afterwards."

Going through the eye-opening slum, interacting with the children there, helping a hand in the salt factory, feeding fish at the park, visiting a temple...enjoyed every bit of it! It's even crazy how the greenest part of Bangkok is just a short boat trip to the other side, but loved biking in it. Yummy phad thai lunch in a very pleasant setting.

Easy cycling, and pedalling through the quieter roads and back lanes of Bangkok with interesting glimpses of Bangkok family life. The itinerary included a number of interesting stops like,The Pagoda at the Chinese Chee Chin Khor temple complex; Santa Cruz church; Wat Arun; Wat Po, which looked beautiful at night and totally devoid of day time visitors and Pak Klong Talad (Flower market). Halfway through the evening we stopped at a local Thai restaurant for a selection of delicious dishes. Bikes were well maintained and had front and back lights.

The bikes looked very professional and functional. The following couple of hours ( until lunch time) we did a relaxing tour to various areas around Bangkok, across the river with a long tail boat (great fun!), through narrow pathways of the canals and oath rough food and veggie markets. Aam planned various stops for us to have a drink and to explain to us a little bit about Thai culture, the villages and the meaning of symbols and religious artefacts. We also visited two temples on our way. For lunch we stopped at a little restaurant outside of the city. The food was ok. We continued the tour and took two more times a boat ( through the canals and over the river again) and arrived at the tour office around 17:00h. Again the transfer back to the hotel has been organised for us. Summary:Gat experience. Very professional team. Our tour guide (Aam) was a really nice guy knowing a lot about the area and the Thai culture. Very much to recommend. Even for those people (like me) who normally do not like biking at all ;)"

Narrow elevated cement paths criss cross the coconut plantations and offer views on very lush swamps and gardens with a few houses and temples.

            "review": "\"Bangkok Paradise\" Bike Tour. At 8am we were introduced to our 3 guides (Tea, Amm and Peach), given two excellent bikes, and an unforgettable day commenced with a small ferry taking the five of us across the river. The three guides spoke English very well and explained everything we saw, heard, and tasted while we explored this other side of Bangkok. We biked through neighborhoods, through farmer- and fish-markets, alongside canals, past fish farms and coconut plantations. We stopped along the way at small stores for drinks and snacks, visited two Buddhist temples, went for a boat-ride along one of the canals, had a terrific Thai lunch, and had a look at an incense 'factory'. We biked and biked and biked some more while enjoying the remarkable nature surrounding the concrete city of Bangkok. Our guides knew all about the flowers, fruits, fish, birds, and other plants and animals we encountered along the way; and their stories about the Buddha and explanations at the temples were enlightening. When dark clouds gathered above us, we were provided rain coats so we could continue our tour without getting wet. At 5pm we were back where we had started. When we arrived at our hotel, an email was already awaiting in our inbox with a link to photo's that were taken during the tour. This was by far the best experience we had during our 10-day stay in Bangkok. We saw a side of Bangkok that most tourists don't get to see. Thanks Tea, Amm and Peach!"

One of my friends was delayed and the guys at Recreational Biking couldn't have been more helpful, allowing her to come and meet us at a point later on in the tour. Peach was an excellent guide, she gave clear instructions which kept us all very safe and she was very informative about the different things we saw. One of my friends isn't very confident when cycling but it wasn't a problem at all. We saw a lot of Bangkok that we would never usually have the opportunity to see which was great! The only thing that I would recommend is taking the tour in the morning as when we set off after lunch, the weather was so hot.Overall it was a fab day with an excellent guide and we will definitely be going on another tour.Thanks Peach!"

On August 23 we made a 4 hour biking tour (colors of Bangkok) and saw a lot of Bangkok that you will not able to see by car. We biked through some very small \"streets\" between the houses of the local people and got a good impression how they live. We also had a look in a salt factory and the guide explained the process. It was also fun to navigate to the semi-island by a small boat. On the island we biked through a natural park and had a look at the way the local people have their vegetable gardens. We had a very tasty lunch in a local restaurant. We stopped by some other interesting places.We were wondering how we could bike safe through the rough traffic of Bangkok. However our guide, Peach, was taking very good care of the safety. She gave clear signs for attention, stopping and slowing down. And at cross roads she sometimes even stopped the cars so we had a safe passage! We really enjoyed the tour. And about good service all the photo's that were taken during the tour were put on the site and we could down load them for free:)"

It was a 5-hour journey through the unseen parts of the city. It was so fun for me, and relaxing, like I left all my worries when I rode that bike. There were much carrying of the bike and the heat can be too intense.The location is about less than an hour from Siam where I stayed and can only be reachable by taxi, but they give you a map in Thai which the taxi driver can read.Our guide, Nat, was proficient in English, compared to my other experiences in Bangkok. Also he was very nice and he will adjust to your pace.They offer refreshments along the way, and lunch. They also will hail a cab for you after the tour.Overall, I would definitely try their other longer tours when I get back! I think getting away from the touristy spots, and not fearing any scams or people trying to get money from you, seeing how local communities and how they go about a normal day is a worthy experience. The guides know the place very well and the communities you'll pass are safe. It was very hot but surprisingly I felt tired after, not during the tour."

We cycled through little alleys, big streets, visited a salt factory and had a soft drink before taking a long tail boat with our bikes over to the other side of the river. There we continued to bike over concrete platforms (1,5 meters wide) in between the houses and we arrived at a park where we fed the fish. On to the floating market where we were served a simple but local and authentic lunch. This tour gives you the opportunity to see Bangkok from a different angle, and I had a lot of fun. Our guide Suzie was fun and informative and we were able to ask her all our questions about Bangkok, the people, the temple and the different things we saw.

I highly recommend this tour, for a short while you cycle through the city which sounds adventurous but it's safe. After that we cycled through slums, middle class living areas, an old salt factory, some temples and through the Bangkok 'jungle'. You'll cross the river on a longboat as well. You wouldn't find all these spots yourself. Along the way there are plenty of stops and water is provided and a nice Thai meal."

It was a great experience to see Bangkok from a different angle. I know most of the tourist places in Bangkok already, so it was very nice to see places that were not even written about in my travel guide! We first visited some places (old salt factory, slum area, temple) on the Bangkok side of the river and then did a short long-tail boat ride over the river to the so-called Jungle of Bangkok. It was very refreshing to get out of the always congested city and to walk through lush nature and plantations. After coming to a park where we fed fish we continued the tour on a Thai rickshaw, had delicious lunch, visited another temple and walked over a fresh market. It was very interesting to listen to the guide's stories about Buddhism and Thai traditions. I would recommend it to everyone who would like to see a clearer picture of Bangkok and how it actually really is, far away from any tourists.I can also fully recommend the Colors of Bankok cycle tour wish I've participated in as well. The area that we cycled in was quite the same as in the Rickshaw & Hike tour, just that we used bicycles. I can only say - what a different and great experience to actually cycle through Bangkok. I would have never dared to do so when I was by myself, but since we had an experienced guide cycling in front, I did not worry one second. Also, we didn't cycle through traffic but took small sideways through a slum and the Jungle. An amazing and fun tour that everyone should do when in Bangkok. You will not regret to book with Recreational Bangkok Biking. Very professional and friendly staff/guides and totally worth its money!!"

We got to explore parts of the city we would not have been able to otherwise, since much of the tour is spent riding in areas that cannot be reached by car or even by tuk tuk. There were some very narrow alleys and raised biking paths to navigate and at first I rode a little nervously. However, the route was well worth it and I wouldn't have changed this aspect at all because I think it added to the fun and adventure, as well as allowed us to see so much more. Not only did we get to ride through busy city areas, alley neighborhoods, and visit factories, we also took our bikes on a boat to an island with a gorgeous jungle landscape. It was beautiful and didn't even feel like we were in the huge city of Bangkok anymore. The tour was kept to a small group and our guide was also great. I would recommend this tour as something one must definitely include in their itinerary when visiting Bangkok! (We did the Colors of Bangkok tour)"

Our excellent guide Farm during this trip took us to undiscovered parts of Bangkok (slums) to see how these very friendly people live. We visited a primary school and salt factory in this first part of the trip.The second part of the trip went to the Bangkok jungle, which is totally different from the very busy Bangkok city, although so close by. Here we visited a temple and had a good fresh lunch served. To reach that jungle we crossed the river, together with the bikes, by a long tail boat.Although we as Dutch people are used to ride a bike, we did not encounter any problems, so is easy to do for anybody who is used to ride a bike now and then. The bikes were well maintained, also low frames were available for the ladies. Our excellent guide Farm, communicated in good English and took several pictures which were placed on Facebook the next day. Frans Verhoeven."

The tour went through modern bangkok, low-mid income living areas and slum living areas. The food offered during lunch was really delicious and was better than many other food outlets we ate during the trip for thai food.As a food person, more food and snacks during the trip could be better.

This was a trip quite different from the normal sightseeing one does in a capital city - it focused on the way poor people live, nature and the river, everyday temples and their uses, etc. It included a delicious lunch at a riverside restaurant, where curious young cats rummaged in my handbag. The rickshaw ride was pleasant and the walk through the \"jungle\" good exercise, we saw several animals including a green snake.The park and fish-feeding was not as interesting to me as some of the other parts, such as the salt factory and homes we saw nearby.The information about the trip was not very clear about what to expect, but we were not disappointed. The guide was very nice and cheerful, and knew the area well. Our small group of four tourists had an excellent time, and the company sent me some nice photos he had taken the very same evening."

The Thai people, even many who lived in the slums said \"Hello\" and smiled at the group as we rode by, many children even came out to clap hands with us. This is a great reminder that happiness does not come from things and can be as simple as greeting someone new.Two boat crossings, lunch & regular water stops ran smoothly.

Tour takes in a few slums, a clothing factory and most fascinating for me at least, a salt factory. If you think you have it tough ever, go and see this. A small veggie snack, and over the river the green space and cycling on raised narrow pathways with one or two stops on route. Then back across the river and back to base for lunch, some of which we cyclists prepared. A good lunch it was too.The cycling is essentially flat but you have to concentrate as it's either through very narrow alleyways or 1 metre high walkways about a metre wide. We were a party of 5, all late forties plus, and we all got round, so it can't be that difficult. Mas, our guide, was great, very informative and chatty. All in all a great tour and I highly recommend it if you want too see the less tourist heart of bangkok."

We were a bit apprehensive about this beforehand, but she didn't complain even once. Kids were full of stories that night of everything they had seen:Very short bit at the start through heavy traffic, where guide guides you through.First stop at a quiet buddhist temple with some explanations about thai buddhism.Then through the slums with great atmosphere. If your kids are cute&blonde like ours, be prepared for everyone waving, giving handshakes and high fives...Then a short boattrip to the other side of the river, where you follow cycle paths through the \"jungle\", banana plantations. A nice stop at a big park where you get to feed the fish, back to the river for a boattrip again, a very short but fun lesson in thai boxing and then its only a couple of minutes to get back to starting point. Also some breaks in between with (soft)drinks and a meal. We were offered this thai meal at the start at the nice lounge area of the companyoffice, where the kids helped making a thai salad.

We are a family of 4 (kids 17 and 14). We are used to biking in Denmark. This tour was a great experience. Our guide was simply amazing - knew all there is to know about Bangkok and was very passionate about telling the stories and facts of the way of living among the various Thai-people. During the tour we got close to both middle/upper-class areas as well as areas where the inhabitants had less means to finance the daily life. We literly met hundreds of smiling faces on the way and handed out a lot of high fives to Thail-children on the tour (keep your balance on the bike here!). The good connections of the tour company - or the guide - allowed us (a Group of 9 people from Belgium, Holland, and Denmark) to see two types of factories from the inside (clothing and salt production) and to pass through very dense pouplated areas close up to daily day life among the Thai-people. The tour can definitely be recommended. The guide was very observant of everybody feeling good during the whole trip - and we had several solid breaks with refreshments. During the tour we also got the experience of going by boat with the bikes twice. In order to get the full enjoyment of the trip you need to feel comfortable on a bike - and be alert in the traffic. If we went to Bangkok again, we would defintely return to this company for another tour in - or around the city."

The route takes you through a really cool park, you see an awesome kickboxing training, there's a great lunch at a local place, you get to go on the water in the longboats, but the part of the tour that has stayed with me the most is biking through the slums. It gave me a much better appreciation for what the citizens of Bangkok live like. I really like that Recreational Bangkok Biking takes the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility; click the CSR link on their website to read about how they've donated millions of baht to a local school). Another aspect of the trip that I enjoyed was that a good portion of the route we biked felt was either on this elevated sidewalk (over the river/marsh) or through the dense housing. It felt like a James Bond movie. The people in the community were very nice and friendly. I kinda wished we could have stayed and heard more about their lives.Lastly, RBB was very well-managed, answering all my questions prior to booking the trip. I highly recommend this tour.

The bicycle are in very well maintained condition.The route through Bangkok is interestingly prepared and about 80% of the route guides you through green and not packed areas...very convenient and nice conditions, even for non-professional cyclers ;)Highly recommended activity and a slight different but very interesting way getting in touch with the people and another view from the town.In between beverages are always available and a lunch is also organised and included...perfect!"

The bikes were good, the daytrip was about 45 kilometers and took from 8 AM to 9 PM. A very nice and good informed guide who knew the history and his Language (English in this case). Drinks were taken care off. And the lunch was real excellent (more than enough, but most important, very tastful). So nice biking, relaxing, some walking, 3 boat trips (from which one the canals) and beautiful nature. And of course a lot of Bangkok city surroundings and sight-seeing. If you are staying a couple of days in Bangkok and if you want to try something exciting not everybody else does, this is the trip."

It also took us into a section of one of the slums. The guide assured us we were welcome as the company supported a daycare there for working parents and, admittedly, the people we passed smiled and waved, but I did still feel a bit like I was intruding and chose not to take photos there. I felt that it was enough that I'd seen how so many people lived, something you don't see in the tourist areas of Bangkok.There was no one working out at the Muay Thai training area when we were there (quite late in the day). The bike riding was easy enough and almost all flat. On the island we rode on raised walkways and quiet roads, and the area through the slums was also pretty light on traffic. However, the start and finish point of the tour is just off a really busy road so there's a lot of fast-moving traffic to negotiate through. The guide was great but I wouldn't recommend it for little kids even though the traffic is generally pretty aware of bicycles. It's something different and well worth doing, especially if you've been to Bangkok before as it shows you a very different side of the city."

We did the half day tour that goes through the city, across the river, the forest, the temple and the boxing ring (I think our guide said it is about 40km). This bike ride was the highlight during our time in Bangkok. I think we enjoyed the tour so much because of three things: a) the bikes are in good condition and very comfortable, b) our Thai guide spoke perfect English c) the ride is a bit rough. My friend and I are quite fit/athletic and the tour was great exercise. I don't think you need to be in top physical condition but probably make sure you are comfortable on a bike - you go through some parts that are quite narrow and bumpy. The only thing that let the trip down a little was that the 'lunch' that was provided was served at about 10am so we didn't really eat much and then were starving later. But this was a minor. The tour was lots of fun, we enjoyed doing something athletic for the day and seeing beautiful parts of Bangkok that the cars/scooters couldn't go. Wear a hat and lots of sunscreen!"

On the main webpage it states, \"As the tour was developed by Recreational Bangkok Biking Ltd., recreation combined with the highest levels of safety standards, remain our top priorities.\" I do not think whoever wrote this took the tour. If they did they would find numerous dangers. Many people have given this tour a high rating, which is why my friend and I booked it. Our tour was on February 12, 2013.The first issue seems to be that Soi 71 is a hard to find place. We left in plenty of time (7am for an 8am tour) from Rambuttri Road, but our taxi driver could not find it (even with the map printout from the website) and had to ask three times for directions. We were an hour late and amazingly they were still waiting for us. There were two girls from Switzerland also on the tour. They said taxi drivers refused to take them there because it was too hard to find. They ended up having to take public transport to as close as possible and then they were able to get a tuk-tuk to take them the rest of the way. I spent most of my time on this tour concentrating on not wiping out. The alleyways in the slums are just too narrow for safe biking and there are a number of holes in the concrete. You are better off walking your bike through these areas. My friend crashed a couple of times and ended up with a nice sized cut on his right elbow and a big bruise on his left forearm. Biking the raised platforms above the water is not safe either since most of them do not have guardrails. I thought I was going to get through the tour unscathed, but on a sharp L shaped turn on the platforms I had to jump off my bike as it headed for the water. I had to slow down too much and when I turned I did not have enough speed and gravity took over. I grabbed a signpost to prevent a bath and my left leg went into the water above my sock. The bike was wedged on the signpost and did not go into the water. However, my left foot was soaked and covered in mud. I was able to finish the tour, but had to pitch my sneakers for a new pair when I got back to the hotel. It also says on the webpage that 95% of the tour is not around traffic. However, it sure felt that we spent a fair amount of time on the busy Bangkok roads. This tour would be great for The Amazing Race. Now I did enjoy the boat rides and you do see an area of Bangkok most tourists would not see. I liked feeding the fish at the park. The lunch at the end of the tour was also good. However, this is no casual European bike ride. I was totally exhausted at the end. It felt more like an extreme adventure and I was glad it was over. I should mention that I own a mountain bike. At least I had an interesting story to tell after all this. If you live life on the edge you will probably love this tour. If you are looking for a casual bike ride to see some sights this is not the tour for you."

We rode in traffic - on extremely narrow paths with jagged fencing and best of all the ride on cement pathways, about 3 feet across, with 4 ft. drop-offs on either side and no railings at all. We ran into a traffic jam on this pathway with a motor bike- one member of our group ended up falling off the path and after flying home discovered he had cracked a few ribs. All of us who went on this ride are experienced road cyclists - I would just strongly recommend you understand whether this ride is right for you."

I look my sister from Melbourne who was staying a few days in Bangkok and she loved it. This is a great way to see a different side of Bangkok. As soon as you cross the Chao Phrya river you enter a green, peaceful, traffic free environment with clean air. It's hard to believe it's part of the same city! As before, we had a delightful and knowledgable guide who got us round the circuit safely with a number of stops en route; local school, fish feeding, temple visit and an excellent lunch at a local restaurant."

I successfully did it and I would recommened to every travellers if you want to see an all rounded Bangkok with fun.PS. I was lucky to have the trip on Sun which has a lot less traffic then weekdays"

Our guide was awesome and knowledgable and even volunteered to demo for the Muay thai boxing. The length of time we were on the bikes was great. I wish I'd had more time to do more of their tours.

Booking was relatively straightforward, with prompt replies from Andre and the staff and finding the depot was a little difficult but the taxi driver eventually found it. The tour was everything I had been looking for in Bangkok. it took you away from the typical Bangkok that most tourists see into the depths of the villages and outter suburbs that are bustling with life and interest. Guide for the trip was very good. Bikes were in good condition. Suitable for all fitness levels. Definitely recommend if you want to see the other side of Bangkok."

We have recently returned from holiday in Thailand where one of the excursions we did was 'Hiking the Colours of Bangkok', operated by Recreational Bangkok Biking. This was our third holiday to Thailand and we like to do excursions that take you off the beaten track to see the real way of life of the local people. This trip was excellent and our guide, Ann was really good and knowledgeable. It was hard to beleive that the area visited was so close to the city as it was so peaceful and beautiful. We ate some good local food at the market and had quite a long rickshaw ride from the market to the local water taxi, stopping at a temple on route (although I did feel a bit sorry for the men driving the rickshaws). We stayed at a hotel on the river front and a taxi from the hotel to Recreational Bangkok's office only took 15 minutes and cost just 80 Baht.To sum up we had an excellent day out visiting parts of Bangkok that we would have missed if we did'nt do this trip. So if you want something a little bit different while visiting Bangkok I would definitely recommend Recreational Bangkok Biking."

And I find out that Bangkok recreational Biking was founded by Andr\u00e9 Breuer a Dutchmen. As you all know the Dutch eat, drink and sleep , bikes.I made a reservation the night before we would like to go. No problem. We had to be there at eight in the morning. We had to go from our hotel (Navelai) to the north east part of Bangkok. I think it is about 15 km. Take your time, 60 min it took, to bring us there by taxi (50 bath). Finally we were late .But no problem we were just with the four of us. At the office we met our guide \"Ann\" a Thai Girl who spoke fluently English. We got 4 excellent bikes with suspension in the front and well performing brakes.The tour took us by traffic lanes, slums, crossing the river , a park, a kind of jungle, and most interesting of all we went through a parking garage. After about 5 hours and including lunch we remembered an astonishing tour we never expected to have in Bangkok.Ann thanks for your your detailed explanation, your patience and your humour well done!You can find in august 2012 a registration on youtube \"Monusdemanvandemaan\" .Andr\u00e9 good luck and succes with this very original idea.Wim, Melinda, Jolanda en Elan"

We explored the back alleys, huts, condos, and parks of a quieter side of ordinary life in Bangkok. This is a step out of the touristy side, into what is the everyday Bangkok. I loved it all. We ate great paht thai in a realistically common home. The local tour guide was professional, friendly and informative, and totally fluent in English rather than the other Thai tours I had been on in barely passable English. (my fifty year old body was a bit sore after a few hours of pedaling.) We had a small tour group of three, which to me, was preferable to many more: me- a middle aged American woman and a young Dutch couple. A fun way to spend an afternoon or morning seeing a more commoner's side of the city. I enjoyed going out into the river on the short river taxi. When I first went into the office about half an hour before the tour, the place was dark and deserted, but a thai boy turned on the lights and let me in. I thought: where the heck am I and what have I gotten into? But the tour was highly recommended to me by a prominent Thai citizen and friend. So I relaxed,slept in a chair until the place came to life. The taxi drivers can never find this place, so be forewarned that you have to call and get directions. It can be found with a bit of time and directions. worth the effort. This is off the beaten path, but very convenient location, not far from major hotels."

I booked the Colours of Bangkok bike tour about two weeks before our trip. The booking process was easy and I received various emails from Andre confirming details and answering any questions I had. We booked the morning tour and arrived nice & early - to our suprise, my husband and I were the only ones on our tour so we had our tour guide 'Geak' to ourselves. It was so wonderful to see different sides of Bangkok and go places that we just wouldn't have gone on our own. Going through the poor area was so interesting and everyone was incredibly friendly. We took a boat trip across the river to the jungle area and also visited around the King's park. We stopped at a school and met the children and had lunch in a house restaurant. We also visited a local temple. The guide provided us with water and the lunch was simple but lovely. My main worry before the trip was that we would find it too hot to cycle around Bangkok - quite the opposite in fact, being on the bike kept us nice & cool as we constantly felt a breeze, it was only when we stopped that we noticed the heat! The only thing I would say is that it says that anyone can take the tour, no matter their experience on a bike. I definitely think you need to have an element of competency and confidence on a bike though as a few parts are on busy roads and others through tight alleyways etc. I would absolutely recommend this tour to anyone visiting Bangkok, the experience was the highlight of our trip and incredible value for money. If you're thinking about booking it, do it, you won't be disappointed."

Very peacefull island with rafthouses and exciting trails thru the forest and the swamps, the transportation to and from the island with a long boat. We felt very relaxed but we can also imagine that the tour is a challenge for older people, who have difficulty to keep their balance. Our group had nice chemistry and that makes the trip even more enjoyable. The lunch was in a local family eating house near the street, simple but very enjoyable with our group of people, open for eachothers lifestyles.

Cycling in and around Bankok is an interesting way to see the city, its richness and its poverty. We were surprised to see how people live outside of the glamour of the city centre, and nevertheless seemed to be happy. A trip in a longtail boat is included, as well as a good and authentic Thai lunch. We do think that the whole day tour can be tiring for older people (certainly in this heat and humidity) and you must have definitely some experience in cycling. It would have been nice to have a map and to see where we actually have been."

As Dutchies we really like to bike and we booked a private tour. We did a 4 hour tour which was perfect for us and our son. The change of scenery, the hustle and bustle of the streets and change of mode of transportation (bike on the boat) made it a very exciting and entertaining trip for all of us. We had a lunch break at a simple restaurant where Pad Thai was prepared on the spot and our son just loves rice and noodles, so really happy. The guide was very flexible and considerate. Our son had a proper seat on the back of my bike and was wearing a helmet."

We saw areas, what you dont see if you go on your own! We crossed the river by longtail boat, very funny! Had a look at some temples, feeded the fishes, we drove through the jungle.

No mushroom, no sojabeans, no bamboo no coffee...Partialy because of the season, but you visit the same number of attraction in the half day tour as in the whole day tour.A bit disappointing."

Second, our guide was very helpful and informative. Third, we saw parts of the city that even as frequent visitors we hadn't seen before. The whole thing felt like a custom-tour made just for us. Among the highlights: loading our bikes onto a narrow boat and being ferried across the river; cycling on suspended concrete paths over rural swampland; seeing a floating market designed for locals rather than tourists; enjoying a simple but delicious lunch of chicken noodle soup; being ferried in a rickshaw; taking a shortcut through a supermarket carpark; seeing a street-level thai kick-boxing training camp and of course a lot of friendly smiling local residents. Our guide told us the tour operator provides assistance to the communities we cycle through (sometimes at very close range!) and they certainly didn't seem to mind our presence. All in all a great day out and one that gave us all a great appetite for dinner."

It may be a typically Dutch thing to consider: exploring a city on bike, but it is well worth the effort!As the guides know the city inside and out, they take the unexpecting cyclist on the most amazing tour of their home turf. Avoiding the main tourist attractions, the tour includes sections of the city that normally do not see tourists (certainly not on bikes!). The routes chosen are mostly away from the main streets, so no need to worry about the roaring traffic. Alleyways, footpaths, supermarket car parks, anything goes when it comes to chosing the most convenient way. And the locals don't mind! In fact, all the children we saw would come out running to us, and the number of high-fives we had to give.... Our tour included a short boat ride across the river to the Sri Nakornkuenkhan Park. The ride in this part of the jungle is on concrete, raised foot paths, and very easy. A stop half-way for lunch was included, and the food and hospitality were excellent. All in all, a highly recommendable, easy and fun way to explore Bangkok!"

We all enjoyed the experience of riding around the streets of Bangkok, down tiny alley ways and on the island on narrow raised walkways. We saw an area of Bangkok that you wouldn't see without a guide. The Thai boxing school stop might seem a bit corny, however our 10 and 12 year old boys loved the dressing up in the shorts and getting some instruction from real Thai boxers. Great photo opportunities. Overall we found this a very professional and well run tour."

We started off at 1.00pm so it was quite warm but it wasn't long before we reached the slums and there was some protection from the sun. The only issue we had with the afternoon tour was that the sweatshop was having lunch and the school was having nap time so we only had one minute stops, looked in the door and off again. The greenest part of Bangkok was really wonderful and certainly a side you don't normally see which was appealing. The paths you ride along aren't overly wide so balancing on a bike is important but you can take your time, just make sure you let your guide know as ours just kept riding."

We went through Bangkok, to the slums, then we went to an island where we fed fishes in the park, then went around and saw the island. We rode the bikes on these 1 yard trails that winded through what looked like a tropical forest. Of course, it was just the woods of the island and a prior coconut plantation. The island was interesting and we visited two different temples on it. We stopped past halfway through the trip and had lunch at a local joint of pad thai. They offered chicken and shrimp but the shrimp made me and another girl sick, which was a reason why our trip was slightly shortened. The water provided was bottled but it tasted like water and dissinfectant iodine. The guides were nice and helpful. I had the biggest smile on my face riding around. It was alot of fun. I would do it again but I'd do the shorter trip. After a while of riding in the sun you get very tired. And I'd definitely skip the meat alltogether, if you dont want the chance of getting sick like I did."

But first we sent numerous messages to the company email to learn more about choosing a ride for our family with three young kids (gas 5, 9, 11). Andre was superb with detailed and speedy answers to all our questions. Yes, they have helmets, yes they provide water, yes the ride in CM is flat, yes there are kid seats for the bikes, yes the bikes are in good (actually excellent) condition. We booked and then awoke in the morning of our tour to find our oldest sick with the flu. We were all bummed but the folks at RBB took it in stride and allowed us to rebook with no penalty; they earned our trust before we ever met any of the team.The instructions on how to find their office are spot on and the location is easy to find. We geared up speedily and off we went into the southern fields of Chiang Mai on the Colors of Chiang Mai tour. The bikes worked just fine and there were no technical problems at all. Our two kids on their own wheels each spilled once (their own mis-steps, nothing to do with the tour) and our tour guide (Yo, a real superstar with good English and great CM & Thailand lore to share) was all over them each time with careful attention and concern for each kid's safety. Most of the path was on either paved or dirt roads through villages and fields. For several short distances the ride follows a secondary road with vehicle traffic. We felt very safe on all surfaces and all parts of the ride. The stop at the family bakery, orphanage (where lunch is provided) and candy factory were fantastic. The ride was relaxing, entertaining, enjoyable, fascinating and down right fun. Really a highlight of our 2 months in CM, I highly recommend this trip and this company."

Especially the ride trough the city park on the small concrete paths passing the lagunes and characteristic local living communities. The trip was full of surprices, with boattrips, visiting temples, parks and a market, picked up by rickshaws and having a wonderfull Thai meal. We thought the cycling tour was very safe and a perfect day out. It is a trip we would highly recommend! Don't hesitate and book the trip....you'll love it!JW Spanjer"

Great guide (Nat!) and really a good way to discover Bangkok in many ways. Even the lunch was very good......After this tour we booked allso the trip in ChiangMai at the same company. Allso here it was really fantastic! (For the dutch people: boek gewoon op de site! Via 333 is het VEEL duurder.....)"

We biked through the slums, nature, we feeded the fish in a park, we crossed the klongs in a boat, visited a old wat. We saw a variety of things and this was a hole new experience of Bangkok! During the tour a meal is provided, all water and other drinks where free and our guide told us some things and answered a lot of questions.

The tour was varied and interesting and our guide Ahm was obliging and helpful, but not having ridden for many years, I found the first 2 hours quite nerve racking as we manoeuvred through traffic initially and then down many narrow alleyways with tight turns, where the Thais were saawadeeing and waiving to us everywhere we went. Even though there were many stops along the way for drinks and a stop for a yummy pad thai snack made by a very animated Thai lady in her home, the pace was fast and it felt quite arduous in the heat (33\u00b0C) after the 3 hour mark. Enjoyable, fascinating, insightful, exciting and challenging. A must do if you want a change from the regular tourist scene. You won\u2019t see another farang anywhere on this tour. The highlight was definitely the children running out to us along the way.Tip - do the Bangkok Food Tour first then this second."

We met lots of friendly locals, visited a kindergarten and ate pad thai at a small local restaurant. It also included a short boat trip across the river. What a nice way to get acquainted with sides of Bangkok you probably never would get to see on your own! Water and food is supplied on the way, so you don't have to carry anything special. This is not a physically demanding trip. Although the route mostly follows quieter roads and allies, at the beginning and end the traffic is a little more dense. I would therefore not recommend it to families with very young children who are not yet mature enough to handle a little bit of traffic hassle. But as soon as they are secure enough on a bike they will love the experience."

Stopped by a kindergarten class - kids were singing christmas carols in June - so we sang along with them! Biked through a park and fed the coi fish, had lunch on the riverside and crossed the river.

You also had the opportunity to experience the might of the Chao Phraya River as the boat weaved across through barges and heavy industry ships! Once off the boat we tiptoed through meter wide platforms over the swamps and through shacks and luxury houses to the beautiful national park where we fed the fish in the stunning ponds!

We passed local schools, parks, and fascinating neighborhoods. And even stopped for a delicious meal of Phad Thai along the way.

You'll stop to see a kindergarden that you are helping to finance with the excursion fee (The owner of this business do understand good marketing!).On the other side of the river, just 10 min. away by boat, you'll be biking in a jungle in the stricter sense of the world. Amazing.Mon, the guide, was fantastic. For example, she flexibly responded to the challenge posed by my shopping binge in the market by buying a baggage rubber band to attach the plunder to my bike's luggage rack.On the whole you'll be biking around 25 kilometers. You'll have time inbetween to chill out in a market and while being carried to and from it in a rickshaw.

Bangkok streets can be a little crazy on a bike but when you ride in a good size group - power in numbers! Be prepared for non-stop sights of beautiful people, amazing country homes, tasty food, and a great workout. You will not regret it!"

Led by an experienced guide, we passed several city hotspots, biked through the slums and got in contact with the local people living in real poverty, crossed the Chao Praya river by boat and left the hectic city life in order to explore the beautiful gardens of Bangkok. A good lunch was included in his 4 hours trip and there were plenty Kodak moments.This excursion gives an opportunity to visit places within the Bangkok area you might not see otherwise as well as getting in contact with local people. All in all an unforgettable experience which I would recommend to anyone who's able to ride a bike!"

You are provided with water and one meal.You see the temples, small thai neighbouhoods, local thai communities and will be provided with a background of it all.Will come again!"

We did the Paradise tour this time nd it brought us again to places we had never seen or dreamed we would ever see. The bikeride, lead by super nice guides, leads you through the back alleys, living areas and sometimes even -houses of the locals. We were a group of approx 10 people and did the long tour. Starting 8 am , back to the rental shop by 430pm. Sounds a long day, but because of the recreational relaxing speed, the good biking materials, the impressions and things to see, the regular breaks for sight seeing (temples, churches, markets, banana plantations), drinks and lunch and also the rides in the long-boats, time just flies. It can be accomplished by anyone who's been on a push-bike before.I bet we went through parts of Bangkok even the locals don't all know about. You wuld never imagine these places exist if one only knows Bangkok downtown.The absolute best way to spend a day and absorb the city.Would recommend it to anyone."

Although Bangkok is already an amazing city to visit if you just stick to the standard touristic highlights, doing this bicycle tour gives you an unexpected and very interesting view of the other side of the city. With a very friendly and helpful guide, you'll cycle throughout the neighborhoods where locals live. In fact, you will cycle right through their living rooms! We did the Colors of Bangkok tour, which is about 25km's. Although it seems far, it is in fact over before you know it. Given the non-existence of mountains in the area, the tour is suitable for all ages and levels of fitness. And there are enough stops on the way where you can buy water or just relax and see the sights."

We were even lucky enough to quickly visit the fantastic kids at the Mercy School - what a school and how fantastic the support that Andre and his team give them! We can't wait to get back to Bangkok to take another ride, and we intend doing the Colours of Chang Mai as well. Every time we have told any friends about the ride, they say the want to come along with us next time too. I can think of nothing better."

I went with my teenage daughter and we cycled aroung the south of Bangkok in areas you would never otherwise see as a tourist. We went to a local produce market, Buddhist Temple, orchid farm, fish farm and rode around areas where people live on canals. In fact I have a friend who visits Bangkok every year and he has never been to the places we went. The bikes are hybrids with fat wheels so easy for anyone to ride although you do need some skill in places. Only very small portions of the tour involved riding on roads and the tour guide was very good at negotiating traffic and taking inexperienced cyclists safely through the traffic. In the whole tour we spent maybe 5% on busy roads so this is not an issue even though you are in Bangkok. You also get a boat ride around a residential area based on canals which is fun. I would do this again, or more likely, try one of the other cycle tours offered by the same company."

We saw many parts of Bangkok that we might never have seen, including affluent villa areas, slum areas, park land, lush farm land and a number of schools.

It's hard to believe that there is still a farming area so close to Bangkok. Lunch was provided at a local open-air cafe along the way. The trip also visited some temples on the way. Our guide (I've forgotten her name) was very helpful and knowledgeable.All up a very enjoyable day.Also getting there was easy.

I had earlier taken a tour from either the same company or similar company through Chiang Mia. that I thought was A++++ fantastic and one that I would do again just because of how much fun it was. This one.... not so much. To start, we didn't get the pickup that most tours give you from your hotel. It wasn't an easy place to find. My girlfriend's bike didn't fit her properly and the bikes weren't in great condition. We also didn't like the tour guide or the tour itself for the following reasons: - She went too far ahead of us several times. There were only two of us on the tour so she should have been more mindful of where we were.  - We never really got to stop if we had a question because she was going so far ahead, as if she didn't like us and just wanted it done as fast as possible. - The tour guide almost never stopped to explain anything. We kept passing by and through some fascinating places. The tour guide in Chiang Mai took a lot of pride in his explanations of the scenery. This tour guide did not. It turned the whole experience into just a scenic bike ride rather than a 'tour.' - Bangkok has a lot to offer and I did this tour to help show off the city's nuances. For this, it was a waste of time and money."

On arrival we were greeted by a friendly tour guide Mon whose English was really good. She was very sweet and gave us a lot of information whilst taking us around parts of the city. The tour itself wasn't too strenious and is suitable for most ages.

We enjoyed the Colours of Bangkok bike ride very much but would advise as an older rider (over 55's) you must be a confident bike rider as some of the sections of the ride are along narrow paths and you have to be able to manouver through narrrow sections. Roads & pavements in Bangkok are not as smooth & even as they are in Australia. We were a group of 6 plus our wonderful guide 'Mon' and it was an amazing experience through the most interesting parts of Bangkok.Thankyou Mon for being the best guide and thanks for patching up Anne when she had her spill!One of the highlights of our trip through ThailandJulie from Melbourne"

Andre, the owner of Recreational Bangkok Biking, was our guide and he showed us a side of the city hidden to most of the world. I think it's fair to say you haven't seen Bangkok unless you've done this tour. We did the colors of Bangkok tour and rode past immaculate villas, through \"slums\" (for lack of better words) - which was my favorite as the people race over to see you and say hello while the kids high-five you as you zoom past, in and out of parks, and through the jungles. We even got on a long-tail boat w/ out bikes at one point! One of the things I like most about Recreational Bangkok Biking in comparison to other biking companies is that Andre only uses locally owned businesses during the tour (for the boat ride and the lunch) and he also sponsors a much needed preschool for the underprivileged kids. Overall, I wouldn't just recommend this to people, I would insist they do it. It's that good."

Once there we cycled through the jungle on pathways used by locals, we passed local houses, went to a Thai country estate to see the million fish in the pond and then on to the floating market.The market was wonderful and our guide bought us various local food samples to try (which we would never have tried on our own) before we headed back to the jungle to a small restaurant/cafe for lunch. After lunch we headed back towards the city, stopping at a few wonderful temples on the way. Our guide could not have been more friendly and helpful and the Thai people (as you find everywhere) were wonderful. This really was a great day out and excellent value for money."

I made the trip Colors of Bangkok twice in one year; the first time with a group of about 10 colleagues, and the last time with only my wife (during the unstable political situation). The bikes were perfect, with 21 gears, comfortable saddle, just what you want when you are used to a good bike at home. After a short tour in the slums we crossed the river and biked through the \"jungle\", i.e. plantations with paved roads and concrete paths through the swamps. Regular stops with drinks and a lunch were included. The pictures and movie on the website offer a good impression. The guides were very enthousiastic and their explanations of the special features were to the point. Also they took good care of the group as a whole to guide them back through the heavy traffic (driving left can be a special hazard!) to the starting point. Too hot to ride a bike? definitely not, because the wind cools you down, but head protection and sunblocker are a must. Rain? no problem, we found shelter when a tropical storm hit us, and after 15 minutes we could continue the trip. Our advice: don't just visit the many temples and tailors when you visit Bagkok, but plan a bicycle too. It will be one of the highlights of your trip, nad certainly one of the days you will still remember years later."

I have been to Thailand many times, but Bangkok has never been one of my favorite destinations, Ive always considered it an aggravating place full of touts, tuk tuks and dreadful traffic. Well, I am so glad I did this tour, because now I have seen a totally different side of Bangkok. Everyone we met all day was so friendly, a fantastic reminder of why people call Thailand the Land of Smiles! It was so refreshing to get away from all the tourist traps and meet the real people of Bangkok. Our guide was Gai, he is really awesome, his English was totally fluent, and he was full of fascinating information on all the places we went. He was very contientious of our safety and comfort at all times, there are plenty of rest stops and he always made sure we had plenty of drinks and snacks. Because you are cycling, you never get too hot because the air circulates around you, the only time I felt a bit hot was when we stopped. The biking is not too strenuous, unless you are extremely unfit you should not have any problems. There is no pressure to rush, you can take your time and go at your own pace, or stop at any time for photo opportunities.I know many people who have gone to Bangkok, gone to all the tourist traps and come back with a bad impression of the city that it is full of scams and touts. This is a real shame, I would recommend this trip to anyone who comes to Bangkok, to see the real Thailand. Next time I am in Bangkok I will definately be doing a longer tour with the company."

By the time we did the trip, the strikes were just finished.The very last day of our honeymoon, we did this very nice trip and saw things you wouldn't believe you're in the capital of Thailand, one of the biggest metropoles of the World. Most of the trip was in the district of Thonbury, the other side of the River. A landscape you shoud believe you're in the coutryside far far from big towns, industry and shopping malls. Biking on narrow streets you cross green lush gardens of the never ending friendly people of Thailand, pass schools and temples while having all the information you need to understand the way of living.This trip is more than worth it.

I emailed the offices the night before to see if there was any availability and I got a promt reply to confirm there was. I booked my place and wondered how they were going to fill 6+ hours cycling.I turned up at the office the following morning, being my first time in Bangkok I got a taxi. I was the last of our group to arrive. There was only 4 other on the tour, an American and a Swiss couple. Our tour guide was Mon and what fantastic guide she was. She was so enthuastic and seemed to be enjoying herself as much as the rest of us.We left the offices and the first few minutes (and return journey to the office) were the only busy roads we cycled on. After a short cycle we were going down small alley ways into where the locals lived. It was hot but cycling kept us cool. There was plenty of stops for water on the way. We put our bikes onto a boat and crossed into the green lung of Bangkok (I think thats what it was called)! We cycled around a park, fed the fish, went to a market, tasted the local food, got on a rickshaw, had lunch, visited a temple. The whole time Mon gave us a detailed commentary of what we were looking at, answered anything we asked and took a genuine interest in the people on the tour. I personnally chatted to her on the return cycle for about 30 minuted telling her about Ireland and it's history. I can't praise her highly enough.My enthusiasm for this trip probably doesn't come accross in the review but all I'll say is if you're in Bangkok you must do this trip. It's fantastic. I even left business cards in my hotel reception to try and spread the word! Don't be put off at the thoughts of cycling for hours in the heat, it's not like that at all. One of the ladies on our tour was about 6 months pregnant and it was no problem to her. All the bikes are in super condition too. The highlight of my time in Thailand.

On the day of my tour, no one else had booked so I had a private tour. The guide spoke excellent English, and was fun.This is a really interesting biking tour. If you read thru previous reviews you'll see the highlights, such as riding thru the narrow alleyways of the slum areas, stopping at a school, T-shirt factory, crossing the river on a longtail boat with the bikes, and riding thru an amazing green area of Bangkok. It's wonderful to see these places that are so different than the tourist areas of Bangkok. The people we met along the way were all very friendly.There are stops during the tour for cool drinks (provided), or photo stops when you want. A delicious lunch is also provided at a restaurant next to the river Chao Phraya.You don't have to be an expert cyclist to do this tour. I'm in my 50's and at home I only ride short distances occasionally, mostly on flat roads. There were a few places that I didn't feel too confident, so I just walked my bike until I got through those places (such as a very narrow alley, or a sharp turn on the concrete path in the jungle area). The guide is very good about leading through the traffic areas, but I did feel a bit nervous being in Bangkok traffic with my limited biking experience. The guide made sure I got through safely.I highly recommend this tour. Don't be afraid to try it. You'll really enjoy it!"

It was a wonderful experience for all of us. Although I was initially worried about the heat, it turned out to be much cooler riding the bike in the daytime (the breeze generated) than it was walking around Bangkok at night. I won't go into detail about all that you see with this tour as other reviewers have already done that, but I will say that it really does show a side of Bangkok that you wouldn't otherwise see. And the Thai people are absolutely wonderful - smiling, welcoming even as you are practicially riding right through their living rooms.I will also say that the bike ride is not overwhelming, if you can ride a bike you can do it. Loved this tour, and have to also say that our guide, Mon, was fantastic. She taught my 15-year old how to count from 1 to 10 in Thai!"

After some quick mailtraffic with Andre Breuer, we could make a reservation to go for a ride on our first and only \"free\" afternoon in Bangkok. After touch down in Bangkok and two hours of rest, we went by cab to the \"Colors of Bangkok\" address. We met Andre and our guide for this afternoon named Mon. She explained the \"rules\". She gave confident to us. At 13.00 hrs. we left on almost new bikes (plus gears...you need it !). The ride was FLABBERGASTING. Riding thru all kinds of Bangkok quarters, a longtail boatride along river Chao Praya (incl. the bikes !), a meal in a local restau, villa's of the rich, riding thru the living rooms (literally) of the slum houses (super friendly people), small temple, a stop at a thai boxing school, you can participate in a fight if you want...(not us), riding over 1,5 mtrs above the water lying bicycle paths, all was great. And that almost avoiding all the crazy motoring traffic, very good route. Our group was only seven people, so good to handle for Mon and easy to communicate with all the participants. Please be sure to wear sun protections (hat, cap and maybe even long sleeves as the sun is BURNING here, even if it's cloudy). Thank you Andre and Mon, we enjoyed every meter of this tour and if ever coming back to Bangkok, we will enter again. Best regards, Sam, Hanneke, Fiona, Jasper."

It realy was a fantastic experience, no one should miss when you are in Bangkok and have a day or half day to spend. They take you to a very special place, at the other side of the Chao Phraya river. It's a green oasis, with concrete cycle paths, you don't know this could even exist in the neighbouhood of such a huge metropole. It's also called the green lungs of Bangkok. The escort is realy reliable, you don;t have to be afraid of traffic on your way to the river, they know how to get there without crossing too many busy roads. We had a tropical shower on the way and were able to shelter with a local family, they were very hospitable, had a great time. So, if you are in Bangkok and you would like to see a part of Bangkok you never could reach by car or tuktuk, just book a tour with Recreational Bangkok Biking!"

My wife and I took this tour after seeing how high it was rated on Tripadvisor's \"Best BAngkok Activities\" section, and I'm SO glad we did - what an adventure!! Initially, my wife had two concerns - the heat and the distance - so I feel those points are worth addressing: Once you are on the bike, the breeze is great, and you're much cooler than standing still in the shade. As long as you remember to drink water, have a hat (or hair I guess) and use sunscreen, you'll be comfortable. After the tour, we both agreed that heat was not a problem at all (our day was 38c and humid). As for the distance, the pace is absolutely relaxed, and appropriate for a non-cyclist. There are no hills, and no sprinting, just easy cruising with frequent stops. Being in traffic was not a problem at all (you're only in it for a few minutes)...we just followed the guide, signalled when appropriate, and everything was fine...though traffic can be heavy, Thai drivers don't seem to display the same aggression that I see here at home - everybody just makes things work, so don't let a little traffic put you off - it was fine, and our guide took charge when necessary to make sure everyone was safe. Our guide J.J. (and new hire Thomas) were both fantastic!! Helpful, easy going, with a great sense of humor. I absolutely recommend this tour as an adjunct to the more usual temple visits, street markets, etc. (a couple of days of that was enough for us). We got there by taxi, but on the way home, we just took a short taxi ride to the BTS station and rode it to our hotel. Either worked fine. I'd recommend booking ahead, but for us it was a last minute decision to go (fortunately they had room), so when we called from ourt hotel, they faxed us a map so we could show the taxi driver where it was - that was very helpful. This tour was fun, informative, educational, and allowed us to connect with wonderful, interesting people, and for me that's what travel is all about. Do it!"

I thought it was crazy, but I said yes and was secretly looking forward to hating it and collecting brownie points from the hubby. I was so wrong. This tour was fabulous. We went with one other couple, our guide JJ (he was so great- and funny!), and Thomas, a guide in training (also great). Like the other reviews we saw the slums, sweatshops, river crossing on a long tail boat, national park, jungle, and a great dinner on the river. The best part was the people you meet... riding 2 feet from the door of their houses and they all smile, wave, say hello, little kids running out to high five you and say \"hello\". It has left me with a completely different impression of this big noisy city. The bikes were comfortable with quite an upright seated position (I'm used to riding a mountain bike at home) and the route was very flat. The few minutes that you are in traffic are very safe and organized. JJ did a great job of keeping our group together. Bring a water bottle, your camera, and an adventurous attitude. You will not regret it."

The second day we wanted to do something else, so we decided to do a full day cycling tour in and around Bangkok (Colours of Bangkok weekend edition with www.bangkokbiking.com).Our group consisted of 3 people with one English speaking guide. The tour was very well organised. We received new drinking water and other drinks many times and there was enough time for a lunch. My personal highlight of the day was visiting the market where we tried different Thai snacks and fruits. I also tried to ride a rickshaw which was more difficult than I thought and quite heavy although I didn\u2019t have a passenger!The cycling was quite easy. Bangkok and it\u2019s surroundings are quite flat which in my opinion means that everyone who can cycle can do this tour. You only have to get used to ride on the left side of the road (to which we are not used to as we are Dutchies).

You might think twice before taking a cycling tour in the middle of Bangkok city, but if you just take common sense it will be an experience of a life time. Me and my wife took the tour with Bangkok Biking ( www.bangkokbiking.com ) and the guide clearly explained what to expect and which route he was planning to take. As we jumped onto the bikes entering the heavy traffic of Bangkok you immediately get the feeling that you\u2019re entering another dimension. Although the traffic around you seems chaotic, it all falls into place when get part of it and the traffic is not as chaotic as it might seems. Enjoy this moment, because before you know it you already leaving the main roads and you entering the city behind the scenes. As we entered a small alley we entered a complete different world, a world you might have seen from up above while looking out of your hotel window. What seems like some suburbs is actually a peek into the real Bangkok. The people where really friendly and you can see that they work hard to make a living. Children especially welcome you by running onto the street, \u201cHello, Hello\u201d \u201cBye, Bye\u201d hoping that you give them a high five. We had several stops and you can just relax and enjoy looking around see how life is made. And with the help of our guide we\u2019d even got into contact with the locals and there profession. A lot of the clothes are sewed within these suburbs while factories provide them the pre-cut fabrics. Even the government offers them orders to sew the clothes of the military. As we leave this beautiful environment it makes you realize that although live is hard it\u2019s still pure, and honest.By ferry \u201csmall wooden boat\u201d we now on our way to the artificial island to visit the park. As you cycle within the mangrove on the small elevated tracks to keep them free of the water the scenery is astonishing. We\u2019d never expect to see this within Bangkok, but it was a welcome relieve to enjoy the silence and to smell the senses of forest and nature. Finally we managed our way on the small tracks and entered the actual park with beautiful ponds with lot of fish. The park is mainly visited by the locals in the weekends, and we\u2019re there on a Tuesday and had the park to our self\u2019s. As we left the park we visiting some temples and made a wish wile pressing the gold leave on the sleeping Buddha. Again we crossed the river by small ferry and again entered busy Bangkok and had lunch at a riverside restaurant. Lunch was great and it may sound unbelievable but I do love Asian food, even in the morning I enjoy every bite. After lunch again hopped onto our bikes to visit a boxing school, these schools prevent children of the suburbs to get off track and give them something to do, as we do like football. Although the school seems small and not like any sport school we might visit but still the initiative is great and should be sponsored by the government.On our way back through several small suburbs, where we were again welcomed by the locals we already knew that this one those trips you\u2019ll always remember. As I write this it has already been two months sins we visited Bangkok, but this trip seems like yesterday.If I can give any advice, Don\u2019t only visit the beautiful temples and palaces of Bangkok but also plan at least one day to get onto the bike and experience the real Bangkok.It was pleasure writing this and hope to visit Bangkok againDanny and Claudia"

But the best part of being in Bangkok was the 1/2 day bike trip we took in the morning (to hot in the pm). We experienced the real back roads of Bangkok I would have never seen if not for this bike trip. Everyone travels to the major attractions, but that gets boring after a while. I wanted to experience the real side of the city and surroundings.There are many bike companies to choose from, but we chose the \"Recreational Bangkok Biking\" E-mail= [--],I forgot what the name of the tour was, but it was the one that road to the back villages and then took the boat (with bikes) over to the other side of the river to the national park & country villages.I highly recommend this if you want to see what life is like other than the typical city attractions.JR"

These were the Tuk Tuk Food Tour and Rattanakosin Walking Tour.The tuk tuk tour was excellent - visiting the local favourites of the Expique office team and their families. All eateries were clean and none too 'adventurous' for anyone willing to try something new. Expique say \"come hungry\" and they are not kidding - we certainly has enough food! Between food stops is the excitement of riding a tuk tuk (still one of my favourite things!). Our tuk tuk had a clear roof, which is a great idea! The tuk tuk routes avoid much of the traffic, but do go past some of the tourist sights - giving a unique nighttime view of these. If tuk tuks and food aren't enough, there are also a couple of opportunities for a relaxed stroll to stretch your legs and let the food go down! We were back at our hotel at about 11pm - and the time just flew! Fully recommended, and lots of fun!The Rattanakosin Walking Tour starts early in the morning at one of the Chaophraya Express piers, and there is nothing like a ride in a fast boat to start the day! The tour covers an area around the Grand Palace, but focuses on some of the sights that would otherwise go unnoticed. Our guide was Esso - and what a guide! With a deep enthusiasm for Thai history, an engaging manner and casual style his presentation of the tour is informative, entertaining and enjoyable. The time just flew past! This is not a strenuous tour, and the pace is gentle - so should be accessible to all.Simon, the owner of Expique, joined us for the tuk tuk tour, and met us for the start of the walking tour. It was great to hear his plans for 'different' tours in Bangkok - and we'll likely be back to try more!"

Once the automobile traffic starts to slacken a bit, the Expique tuk-tuks come alive and the fun begins.One of the highlights was blasting around the streets in a light drizzle (ponchos provided) and watching the city lights flicker on the damp pavement.The late night stop for Pad Thai at Thip Samai was perfect. Lines of late night diners standing under open umbrellas waiting for a table inside to sample the World's Best Pad Thai (that's what the award covered walls say).This is a 'must do' if you wish to enjoy a memorable evening in Bangkok!"

The King has just passed away so tour guide Esso was able to provide lots of context and history. It was warm, but not nearly as warm as during the day, and the tuk-tuks make the tour especially fun.

With all the conflicting commentary on renting your own tuk tuks, this was a great, safe alternative that allowed us the fun experience of riding around in a tuk tuk paired with an informative, cultural and delicious tour!Our tour guide did a fantastic job all evening of sharing information about Thai culture, specific landmarks, etc. She was absolutely on point in keeping us all together and touring through busy markets, but still found quiet spots for us to stop, ponder and discuss. Very professional and fun at the same time!The food stops were quite delicious - little snacks in various markets, a stop for some good pad thai at a local famous restaurant and dessert and crafts at the end. While I wasn't stuffed by the end of the night, I was certainly well fed and happy.Would thoroughly recommend this tour as a great way to see the vibrant city of Bangkok in a unique way at night. The tuk tuks are fun, it was awesome to see Wat Pho at night (although the reclining Buddha is not accessible then) and it was nice to have a guided tour through some of the madness of Bangkok markets."

There are cold bottles of water constantly being replenished in the tuk tuk and the cold towel mid-tour is a great touch. The food is really good, already organised for you when you arrive so no waiting around/queuing up which is often an annoying part of food tour.

I initially only signed up for the tuk tuk night tour but when I was unable to find any other company that was available, communicative - or really just nice - I asked if they would do a private tour for my parents and I of various places we wanted to see. Simon responded quickly. With his own input, we agreed on a schedule over 5 days and I don't regret my choice. I can't recommend their guides (we were with Natt and Esso) and drivers enough. Their knowledge, professionalism and all around kindness were felt. Simon's too. My parents are older and Esso really took this into consideration when taking them around. It was a great introduction to Bangkok and the main attractions. If you can though, I highly recommend the Diversity and Harmony tour - we enjoyed interacting with the locals and getting to know more of a side of Bangkok that's likely unknown to the majority of tourists. And whatever you do - Ayutthaya is a must see. Thank you Team Expique!"

The seafood food was incredibly good, as were the snacks that we tried at various street vendors. The guide's knowledge and fun demeanour made it one of our best days out. .The other tours -the night Tuk-Tuk and the Diversity tour were also first class. Well done!"

There\u2019s so many tours in Bangkok, but it can be hard to find something out of the ordinary. Then we came across Expique with their Mystery Tuk Tuk Night Tour. It was an experimental tour, for a special price - for them to experiment with new routes and get feedback from their customers.This was exactly what we were looking for. Food, temples, Bangkok at night, zipping around in a Tuk Tuk. It was really lovely. The tour took about 4 hours or so and we explored a lot of local markets and street food, also on the other side of the river - an area you don\u2019t usually come as a tourist. We tried all sorts of stuff, from chinese pastries and suki yaki and fried sticky chicken to glutenous sesame-seed desserts. No green curry and pad thai here. For our experimental tour we had multiple guides, and they were all lovely. Knowledgable and good english. More importantly, they were all happy and friendly and seemed genuinely excited to be hosting the tour and explaining things and answering questions.If you're a foodie or feeling adventurous I would definitely recommend their Mystery tour, we're looking forward to trying their our tours as well."

Esso made an instant connection with our kids and the way they were smiling the whole time, told me that they were enjoying their selves despite their initial reluctance. Bangkok at night is magical and it is so much fun riding around in the tuk tuk's with the clear plastic roofs. I think the highlight for me was visiting the Temple of the reclining Buddha. We were the only ones there. It was an amazing, almost mystical experience! Imagine being in a city of millions of people and having a private night tour of one of the most holiest places of Bangkok! The whole trip was fun and we enjoyed the food. Do not eat before doing this tour!!!Thanks Esso, we had a fabulous time. The Tuk Tuk drivers were super too. This is the way to see Bangkok at night!!"

Imagine strolling the grounds of the Reclining Buddha Temple at night under the stars, leisurely admiring everything and appreciating the peaceful feeling that comes with touring at night with only a handful of others there. We tasted delicious local food as we walked through the markets and were lucky enough to tour the flower markets the last night before they were moved inside. Riding in the tuk tuks was fun and provided a much needed cool breeze. Before taking this tour my description of Bangkok would have been a busy concrete jungle.

When members of the party were late, they had a staff member an a tuk tuk stay behind and wait for them, and then made sure they caught up with the rest of the tour. The night time sites were fantastic, and Esso was a fantastic guide. Knowledgable and really focused on providing us with a cultural overview --in other words, he gave participants an understanding of the cultural significance of different sites for the Thai people. in addition, this tour did a handful of food stops which were great and also gave us a chance to meet and talk with fellow participants. I enjoyed this tour so much that I decided to do the Food Mystery tour. We went to numerous spots to try street food and Thai specialties. Really great food at a diverse set of spots throughout the city. There were thunder showers and they supplied us with umbrellas and ponchos. The tuk tuk experience was fantastic. I cannot recommend this company enough. Fun, relaxed, and really substantive tour. I never felt rushed or herded from site to site. That was really what made these tours so great. I would sign up for another tour with them in a heartbeat."

Our guide, Jib, was a real gem- upbeat, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, accommodating, patient and overall lovely to be around. She truly made the experience for us. The tuc tuc drivers were courteous, helpful and the transparent tops were great for seeing the sights from the tuc tuc. The tour takes in many of the key sights of the city and is a great way to get the lay of the land and taste some authentic food on your first or second night, then plan what you'd like to do the next day based on what you saw. Expect that it may rain a bit and carry a cheap poncho or umbrella just in case. If I come back to Bangkok I'd definitely do another tour with this company. Well worth the money and time."

I have to say that this was a very worthy and enjoyable way to experience some of the night life in Bangkok. Met up with a group of tourists from various regions and we were introduced to Nat and Esso, who were our guides for the evening. Nat and Esso were very friendly and professional and made the effort to mingle and get to know you as a traveler. I also appreciated how they tried to break the ice and get us as strangers to interact with one another. I know meeting a stranger far away from home can be a little intimidating, but I think that helped make this evening tour a much stronger and social experience. What made the tour even more fun was riding around town on the back of a tuk tuk (motorcycle taxi) and seeing all what Bangkok's night life looks and feels like along with the extreme night humidity. The sites were interesting, Nat was good at telling stories and I enjoyed the snacking and eventually having a good Pad Thai dinner at a long-time Bangkok restaurant called \"Thipsamai\" We eventually wrapped up the evening in China Town with a Mango and Sticky Rice dessert. It's a very fun way to experience Bangkok. If you're a first time visitor to Thailand, I highly recommend it even more."

There I was greeted by a You Thai girl. we then met out tuk tuk drivers and fellow travelers. I had read horror stories of being alone in a tuk tuk, so this was a perfect way to experience. So we get started by zipping through the streets of Bangkok, we stop at a local food market snd try a few quick items. I loved the chance to try the food in a small dose. Next stop was a few temples, beautiful to see lit up at night then headed to local restaurant for PadThai and fresh oj. Dang this place was hoppin and the food killer, and I'm talking the kind of delicious u dream about.

The tuktuk drivers were all very polite and everything was really well organized.

Everything we tried (all included in the price of the tour) was very tasty and there were plenty of unusual fruits, snacks, flavors etc that I had never tried before. My only constructive criticism is that, at just over four hours, the tour is quite long. Even though I really enjoyed it, I think it could perhaps be condensed into three hours - particularly given that it starts quite late in the evening. That said, it is overall a great tour and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for an interesting and fun way to spend an evening in Bangkok!"

The sights ranged from local night markets to temples (spectacular at night!) and public spaces. We tried all sorts of foods at various stops, both familiar (Pad Thai) and the more exotic (Pandan custard and Durian). Esso was a delightful, funny and informative guide. He genuinely enjoys what he does and loves showing off his city to visitors. The four hours flew by so quickly, and we didn't want it to end. A must for any visitor to Bangkok.Side note: At the end of the tour there is an option to have the Tuk Tuk driver take you back to your hotel for a fee of about $5. Take it. While technically a taxi would be cheaper, it's almost impossible to find one in Chinatown (the final stop) that's willing to go by the meter, and they charge upwards of $10. Besides, it's almost midnight, and the open air ride in the thinning traffic is refreshing, relaxing and fun, even when we went, in April, which is the hottest month of the year there."

You won't be driven around in silence somberly looking at landmarks and having brief interactions with dour staff who just want to get the job done and go home. Our guide Ai was super cheerful and so were our Tuk Tuk drivers. The owner Simon also imparted a great spirit and attitude to get us started. I think this an area where many tour companies fall flat but where Expique excels. If you want happy customers BE HAPPY! Great experience thanks!"

The enthusiasm of both Simon and our tour guide was contagious. All the food we had was delicious, especially at Thip Samai- what an unforgettable meal! It was such a unique way to learn about the city and see attractions that we definitely would have otherwise overlooked. Our guide could not have been more kind and knowledgeable- the tour was undoubtedly our favorite memory from Bangkok. Wholeheartedly recommend a tour with Expique!"

We were divvied up by twos and met our Tuk Tuk driver for the evening. We were impressed by the \"team\" approach Simon took in introducing the drivers and our guide. The tour was well organized and although the temples we visited were closed, many of the grounds were open for other functions and we were able to walk about which was a nice change from visiting during the day when the crowds were overwhelming. This was a food tour as well and our appetizer, which came from a street cart, tasted much like fried dough. The main course came from Thip Sanai, the most famous and original Pad Thai place in Bangkok. It really was excellent. Finally we finished in Chinatown for dessert of fresh mango and sticky sweet rice, another delicious treat. Our Tuk-Tuk driver brought us back to our hotel. A terrific way to spend an evening."

Esso links the stories to really bring the tour to life and it felt like having a very knowledgeable friend in Bangkok.Simon also gave us great tips for restaurants in easy reach of our hotel which enhanced our 3 night stay in Bangkok, much appreciated!We will book another tour with Expique next time we are in Bangkok."

Our guide for the night was Jib and she was full of energy and you could really tell she has a passion to share her knowledge with others. There were only six people in our group. More people had booked the tour but we were split off and the others had another guide. Jib was funny, entertaining and very knowledgeable. The tuk tuks used for the tour are very clean and have a see through roof. They were so nice that when we were stopped at a red light, a random tuk tuk driver leaned over with tuk tuk envy, said wowww and gave us the thumbs up. The tour started conveniently at a transit station and we visited many places that we would not get to ourselves. For me, the highlight of the tour was a visit to the flower market. Other tours and guides had always pointed it out from afar like when on a boat in the river. But to actually visit was awesome. Apparently it's open 24 hours a day. I had no idea that it was so big and they had the absolute freshest produce you could find. It's amazing to see this in action, especially coming from North America where grocery stores are a super-sized one stop shop. We also visited a local market which used to be the train station in town, the giant swing close to city hall, and wat pho at night (sure beats the crowds and heat). Of course I'm forgetting all the delicious food we ate, including the most famous pad thai restaurant, Thip Samai. The restaurant takes a long time to get a seat but the company had a guy waiting in line for us. Wow, what service! The restaurant is quite famous as it has many newspaper article less written about them from all over the world. The tour ends with some Mango sticky rice in Chinatown. Who doesn't like Mango sticky rice?My wife and I took a bunch of tours over our two weeks in Thailand and this was my favorite. If there's one thing you do while in Bangkok I would absolutely recommend this tour. Side note, the tour ends around 11pm in Chinatown. The company has negotiated a flat rate of 150 bhat for the tuk tuk to return you back to your hotel which was extra convenient."

What a fantastic experience. This was my second trip to Bangkok in the last few months and we did tours with Expique both times. Esso was our guide on the Harmony and Diversity walking tour and we really really enjoyed his knowledge of history and his ability to show tourists a \"behind the scenes\" look at Bangkok. I think one of the most valuable things a traveler can experience is to see a city or place through the eyes of a local. That's exactly what we got. There is no way a tourist is going to have an experience like this on their own. it's one thing to \"see the sights\" and snap a few photos but entirely another to have a backstreet experience with a local explaining all the historical and cultural nuances.The night Tuk Tuk tour was brilliant too but for different reasons. First off if you've traveled by Tuk Tuk before you'll know that your vision is quite limited due to the fact that you're under a pretty low roof. The Tuk Tuks that Expique uses have transparent tops that allow you to see much more of the city as you go whizzing through it. We really loved that. We also loved the fact that we could cover so much ground in the Tuk Tuks in such a short time. There are also benefits to doing a tour like this at night, temperature and crowds (or lack thereof) being the most notable. Finally, we stopped at a fantastic restaurant for some top notch Pad Thai (apparently voted best in Bangkok) and didn't even have to queue up for hours out front as Expique had previously arranged our booking.We did all our booking online. It was fast and easy and they were very professional in terms of punctuality and customer service. Based on my experience (4 tours on 2 separate trips) I'd recommend Expique to anyone that really wants to get a deeper experience than the normal tourist checklist would provide."

The driver was polite and drove at a safe pace. We were offered cold towels and water throughout the trip. We visited a number of food stalls and famous Bangkok sites, the highlights bring Wat Po (only us there and beautifully lit up) and the flower market. We were dropped off at a destination of our choice at the end of the evening. A lovely touch from Cheep when she presented my friend and I with a lovely bunch of purple orchids that we had mentioned to her that we liked when walking through the flower market. The driver had bought them when we weren't looking! What a lovely surprise. Highly recommended and will be booking again when I return to BKK with my husband in November."

It was nice and easy to find and get to, being at the sky train station! While we waited for the other group members to arrive (there were 7 of us in total) Namo explained the plan for the evening and gave us little maps which explained where we were going to go. Some of our group were stuck in traffic so we set off and met them at the first stop. We were shown to our tuk tuks and introduced to our drivers. They had cold bottles of water in the tuk tuks which they offered to us throughout the evening which was a nice touch. Over the evening we zipped around Bangkok in our tuk tuks and visited all the places mentioned on the website. We went to Klong San Market where we tried some street food which was purchased by our guide and we were all given some to sample, some savoury and some sweet. We went to 2 temples - Wat Prayoon and Wat Pho. We had been to Wat Pho during the day and this was a completely different and amazing experience. It was so peaceful at night! We also went to the Giant Swing and the 24 hour flower market. The tour also included dinner at a restaurant which serves the best pad thai in Bangkok (and it was delicious!) and mango sticky rice in Chinatown for dessert. Namo was a great guide. She had a good sense of humour and was a wealth of information! She made sure we were all having a good time and eating lots of yummy food so we would go home with full tummys!

You then are presented with a little leaflet of tour and Thai sayings.

The tuk tuks are really good fun, I thought that they would be smelly and horrible with fumes but the best way to see Bangkok in 4 hours, we were only there for the weekend and best choice that I made was to book this and see Bangkok from a different perspective.

Due to our large crowd, I decided to book a private tour with Expique in particular the Bangkok Night Tuk Tuk Tours.The pre-trip correspondence with Simon was full of ease. He was kind and helpful. My family and I enjoyed the short time that Simon spent with us to ensure the safety of my family.Overall, the tour was well-planned and it was worth the money. My family and I had no complaints and even wished that the tour could be extended.The main tour guide, Jib, was the best. My siblings could not stop raving about how great she was. She was able to attract the attention of both the young and old. Her stories on the history of the attractions we visited were truly remarkable and interesting. Not only did we learnt something new, all of us had fun and it was a once in a lifetime experience.Jib not only displayed a high level of knowledge but she was also sincere in trying to get to know each one of my 9 other family members which is truly amazing. She is the epitome of a great tour guide and I highly recommend her to everyone who books the tour. The trip was great because we had a great guide!"

The tuk tuk drivers are very polite and helpful. I would recommend Expique to all travelers who are interested in taking a night tuk tuk tour."

Every place we visited was fascinating! One of the best parts of the tour was seeing the temples at night - when the crowds are all gone and the temperature outside is more bearable. Each stop we made was really interesting - and probably not places I would have visited on my own. The markets were fascinating - especially the flower market, which was definitely my favorite. The food we tried was terrific but what made it more special was the context. This was definitely the highlight of my visit to Bangkok and highly recommended."

Small group numbers mean there is an intimacy to expique tours that large coach tours just cannot match, making you feel valued and cherished as a visitor to this beautiful land of smiles (which given the amount of sour faces at arrivals at the airport, I had worried might have changed since my previous visit). I look forward to returning and joining a few of the walking tours for more insight into all things uniquely Thai. Thank you Expique - long may you flourish."

The tuk tuks are comfortable, you can have as much water as you need. The tops are see-through, there were 2 persons to a tuk tuk and the places we went to were GREAT. The flower market is spectacular as was the first local market. Our guide spoke very good English and was very cute and knowledgable. She loves her city. The snacks she bought for us were delicious and on my own I would not have dared to buy them. This way you are introduced to things you would normally just look over. The dinner was very good too and all in all everyone had a great time. One of the tuk tuks drove me to my hotel after the tour which I found very considerate. I would highly recommend this tour especially to single travelers."

We knew we were coming to Bangkok and had little knowledge of what to see and do so we got in touch with Simon and his team who were such an amazing help and organised a few private tours as well as the infamous Tuk Tuk night tour. They answered all emails promptly and gave us great advice even about what to wear to the temples etc to ensure that we didn't get caught out. On the first day we were met at our hotel by Simon and Esso our private guide who was going to show us the sights and sounds of Bangkok. Esso was friendly and fun and really well informed and made the 2 days fly by! I would strongly recommend booking a tour with him. On the first day which was a private tour we went to all the main temples including Wat Pho, The Grand Palace, Wat Arun etc. It was amazing and Esso picked us up nice and early so we beat most of the crowds. They really are beautiful and well worth the trip. We then went and did the river sights and a canal tour which was simply amazing. Taking a long tail boat through the canals and seeing the local life really did allow us to see the non tourist side of Bangkok and experience real culture. We also went and had some terrific food as a local restaurant on the river and Esso ordered us a variety of food to try and needless to say we fell in love with some of the tastes!! Especially the soups! After that Esso escorted us back home on the sky train which was another experience altogether!! After a quick nap we then headed out for the Tuk Tuk nighttime tour which was led by Yin and she was fantastic! It is clear she has a love for the city which changes so drastically at night time compared to day. We explored some quirky markets, saw local people cooking and selling street food, saw the temples at night and had an amazing meal with delicious Pad Thai and the most refreshing orange juice in the world! The Tuk Tuk itself is such a fun experience and as you whizz around Bangkok with the wind in your hair you definitely feel like you are on holiday! We picked up a lot of knowledge that night that you simply can't pick up by reading a guide book. It finishes around 11.30 and then we got the Tuk Tuk back to our hotel. The next day we were up bright at early and left at 7 to explore the floating markets. We went to a couple that day. The first was a quieter traditional one where local people buy and sell fruit, vegetables and other foods and to float by on a boat and watch local children play in the river and dogs running around was lovely! It felt like we were people watching on an everyday weekend ritual. The next was the famous damneon which was simply the opposite. It was much much busier and full of tourists however good to get the contrast with. Snakes, monkeys, spiders were aplenty for you to have photos with and they sell a lot of clothing and market type souvenirs aimed at tourists. After a delicious lunch of more traditional Thai food on a river side restaurant it was back to the hotel before an early morning flight.The private tours had all transport, food and drinks included as well as the guide and were extremely good value for money. Esso was excellent and had funny stories and such a great manner about him that I wish we could have done more! Thanks Simon and the team for making our first trip to Thailand such an amazing start!

Later, we went back to the temples during the day (so when we got home we had day and night pics of the same temples). The first place you start Klong San Market. This is a great market to shop for clothing (although not much time to shop on this tour). We went to a different market later and the Klong San Market was a better market. When you book this tour, please look at all their stops. They do follow exactly what is written on their website. The night we went, 2 girls were furious that we were going to the flower market because they went to the flower market during the day. So check all the stops.

My husband and I lived in Thailand for a few years and it was great for us to explore our old home in a new way."

Initially we were extremely late (first night in Bangkok) and got there thinking they had left without us, but to our surprise, they were nice enough to wait for us. We do recommend leaving your hotel early enough to make it on time, specially if you are new to the Bangkok transport system. The rest of the night was amazing, a lot to see and take in. The food was really good! I have a lot of food restrictions but Simon and the team worked very hard at providing different options for me. Overall, this tour is a must do if you stay in Bangkok!"

Our guide Jib was an absolute sweetheart who was very knowledgeable, friendly and welcoming....with a lovely gesture for the group at the end of the tour. Cannoy recommend this tour enough!

Our tour guide Esso made the tour very interesting telling us cultural stories about a local ghost, funerals (as one was being conducted at a temple we visited), about the Thai religion and beliefs, and food. Bangkok is so lively at night so you get to see all that's happening (especially the flower market!).I would recommend this tour especially to young adults - maybe not the elderly or young children as the Tuktuks can be a bit bumpy."

Great way to see around the city. Our guide Bee was able to share more than just history and facts with lots of info on Thai life. The drivers were friendly and the tuk Turks comfortable and safe. If you're almost 6 foot tall like me these tuk tuks with transparent roofs are the only way you'll see anything. Visited markets (ate our way round) and sights and got to spend time in Wat Pho in the evening when lit up. So much more pleasant than fighting for space with other tourists during the day. Food was great and we were fed and provided with water all through the tour. I'm a huge fan of small group tours (our tour had five couples in convoy in our tuk tuks) and this one didn't disappoint. If you're looking for a tour this one is highly recommended."

Despite time restrictions she did her best to let us take in the sites and even do a little shopping. It was hot as hell the day I went but they went out of their way by giving us cold waters and cold packaged face towels. Jib's english is absolutely perfect if that is also a concern. So basically if you decide to reserve this tour try to get jib as your guide. I would definitely recommend this tour."

The Pad Thai was excellent. There was a long line to eat at this place, but we had reservations waiting! Very good at considering this restaurant as Pad Thai is the hallmark delicacy of Thailand. The tuk tuk drivers were very gracious. Very considerate especially with the hard down-pour. The tuk tuks were easily identifiable (good points for safety), important in the rainy dark streets. They have the tour logo in the back and they line up with their different colored lights while they wait; ours was blue. Our tuk tuk also took us to our hotel after the tour. Great job Expique!!!

It certainly felt a lot shorter than 4 hours, which is good because it meant I enjoyed the tour a lot I didn't notice where all those hours had gone to.

Jib and Namo filled us to the brim with streetfood, snacks I wouldn't have dared try on my own, world famous pad Thai and sticky rice. Plus they bought us anything at the markets that we hadn't tried yet (local fruits etc). I loved the lotus flower folding- we ran into a friend of Jib's who taught us at the flower market. I mentioned my birthday was coming up and the girls even got birthday candles for me. I even got an impromptu motorcycle ride back to the station.Do yourself a favour and book this tour before everyone catches on."

Simon, I believe the CEO of Expique, was very gracious in accommodating all of our needs (kids, vegetarians, etc.) throughout the whole booking process. We were picked up by 2 vans from our hotel, and our guides were Natt and Namo who were both super friendly and just delightful. There was some traffic plus it was raining that day so we were a bit disappointed about that, but once we arrived at the drop off place and saw all those colorfully lit up tuk tuks, we were just amazed. There were 7 tuk tuks all parked in line, and each driver had the same uniform shirt and cap, and holding umbrellas for us! They even provided us with ponchos! What a great service and organization. We were so impressed that they were so prepared! So off we started on our tour. The air while you're riding in these open tuk tuks was just a great break from the morning summer heat of Bangkok so it was refreshing, plus the lights of the city were fantastic. Since it was raining, we didn't really get to get out to see the big swing, but we did pass by it. We ate at this hidden local restaurant that is behind this dark alley where they were cooking the food outside, and the food was just delicious! The food was a good portion. Like I said, we had kids so of course there were some picky eaters and drinkers. Namo was so sweet to even go out to get some juice for them because the restaurant did not have any. The tuk tuk drivers also had cold water and refreshing towels for each one of us after we finished Wat Pho. They were just amazing! We ended the tour eating mango and sticky rice at Chinatown, and Natt and Namo got us extra plates because some really loved it. They gave the women and the kids a flower bracelet each from the flower market as their token of appreciation, and that was just the topping on the cake. It was great that we also had the vans to take us back to the hotel because the kids were pooped out. Overall, it was an amazing time with Natt and Namo and the drivers, and we would definitely recommend this. Thank you again Expique for the wonderful time!"

Myself and my girlfriend booked this tour just the night before having read about it on a travelling blog \u2013 what a great decision it turned out to be! The meeting point for the at Krung Thonburi BTS station. Here we met Jip (pronounced Jeep), our guide for the evening. There was to be 8 people on the tour and with two people per tuk-tuk, we set off as soon as everyone had arrived. Our first stop was Klong San Market. Jip guided us through the market, giving us its history and pointing out interesting aspects of everyday life in Thailand. About halfway through the market she stopped to talk about the food being sold by one of the vendors. Unexpectedly, she ordered some for each person and offered it around! I had not expected the tour to literally include a taste of Thai culture so this was a great and very pleasant surprise! After the market, we drove to the riverside where Jip gave us some of its history and offered us some bread and green custard \u2013 an odd combination to those (like myself!) who are not used to it but very tasty nonetheless! We then moved on to Wat Prayurawongsawat where we unexpectedly happened to witness the burning of paper as an offering at death. Following this we moved on to the Giant Swing and the to dinner at Thip Samai. it's proclaimed to be the best Pad Thai in the world and it certainly didn\u2019t disappoint!After dinner we moved to Wat Pho which was incredible to experience while deserted in the dark of night. This was followed by a trip to the flow and vegetable market \u2013 a maze of colours where once again, Jip bought fruit for everyone to sample for dessert! We finished up in Chinatown, where along with the fruit, we were served mango and stick rice for dessert. Afterwards we were give the option to hire our tuk-tuk to take us back to our hotel for a (quite reasonable) fee. I cannot recommend this tour enough, both for the very different experience of Bangkok that it provides and the exceptional friendliness of our tour guide, Jip, and all staff involved!"

It was a small place and super busy (with locals) located down the back of an alleyway. We tried about 6 - 8 different dishes which were delicious. I really liked the variety. Another good thing about Monday is that because it varies from the normal itinerary a bit there were only 5 of us so a small group."

Not a great tour if your primary objective is to sample many kinds of street foods as possible. From previous reviews it appeared that there was a lot of food tasting, but this must have been cut down, because our tour had very few.The best dish was the Pad Thai, we had this in probably the best restaurant for this food in Bangkok, Thip Samai. The other food we were offered was bread with pandan sauce, a peanut biscuit and sticky rice with mango, all which were sweet and I expected a lot more savoury tasting. Out of the 4 street food tours in 3 countries, this unfortunately was the most disappointing. If temples are you primary reason, then you would probably enjoy this tour, if it's food you are after, look elsewhere."

The TukTuk driver was a great guy and it was Value for Money. I was picked up at hotel and brought back and got a great taste of Bangkok in many ways in a short time. Go for it"

With only 36hrs in BKK I was a little stuck when planning an itinerary for my friend and I, as my friend had never been to Asia before.I handed over the reigns to the team at Expique, and in no time at all we had a personalised day tour set up.Our guide Esso arrived on time (in fact early) at our accommodation, and for the next 8 hours we were buzzing around BKK, seeing all of the key sights, trying delicious food and drinks, and having a great time!From the moment I first emailed Expique to enquire about a personalised tour, to the moment we returned to our hotel after the tour, every aspect was faultless. Even the follow up email was a nice touch, and included photos of my friend and I on the tour.I cannot praise highly enough the energy and enthusiasm of our guide Esso. I'm not a fan of tours normally, but I feel I have learnt so much more about a country I thought I knew quite well, with the added bonus of experiencing it with a local.If you're even remotely considering a tour, go with Expique. You'll be glad you did, and the memories and photos will stay with you forever."

Good way to get your bearings and ask your questions about the city. The young guide was enthusiastic, but frankly he could have been more informative in my opinion. Overall, tour was OK, not the best. It did give me a taste of the city and what's in for us in the next days to come. So, if your expectation is an introduction to Bangkok at night time (during considerably cooler weather) then, you will be satisfied."

Even our moderately severe jet lag could not dampen the splendor of the illuminated temples or the sparkling riverfront at night. Our tastebuds were continuously awakened by various tasty street foods including squid eggs, noodle dishes, and durian (!). Jib even picked up a couple extra dishes when we expressed interest, which were not part of the planned tour. In between munching, Jib educated us about some of the history of Thailand, the royal family, the establishment of Bangkok as the most recent capital, and the regional religions. Toward the end of our tour, we were particularly charmed by the sprawling nighttime flower market. Dozens of beautiful blooms in vibrant colors lined streets for blocks, and we got to speak with a few of the vendors. Throughout the tour, Jib answered all of our questions and really stimulated my interest in the country and culture of Thailand. The tuk tuk drivers were great, and it was a cool way to get around. Thanks Jib for an awesome experience!"

We had a few issues getting to the BTS station (meeting point) because the skytrain shut down about an hour prior to the tour start due to a tree had falling on the track from a bad storm. I was feeling pretty defeated as time ticked by and almost returned to my hotel, bummed. Just then, at about 710pm (tour started at 7) I received a call from Simon explaining that he knew about the skytrain issues and while most of the tour was leaving, he would wait. We were so grateful for this! We finally arrived at about 730 and were off. Simon gave us a quick market tour with zero pressure to buy anything, and we then caught up with the rest of the group. Esso was our guide from there on out and he was so knowledgeable about everything Bangkok. We walked along the river while having a snack, went to the flower market and learned how to 'fold' a lotus, visited Wat Pho (amazing at night!), and zipped through the streets of Bangkok in tuk tuks, adn so much more. The tuk tuk rides were exhilarating but I never felt in danger. Our driver was very friendly and accommodating. We had dinner at a world renowned pad Thai restaurant and felt like VIPs as there was a huge wait that we immediately bypassed. The night ended in Chinatown after we tried some traditional Chinese desserts. I can't say I enjoyed the desserts but I am glad I got to try them as I would've never known what to order on my own. Do the tour - you won't regret it!"

I have been put off tours as some in the past have become boring and mundane and take you to places where you are expected to purchase goods from their associated vendors. This is not the case here. Every minute of this tour is interesting, exciting and informative. The Tuk Tuk was comfortable but you aren't stuck in it for too long anyway. There is way too much to do & see. I came away from this thinking there is no way I could have seen so much in one night if I tried this on my own and this is seriously the only way to see Bangkok at night. Now the big plus here was our guide Jib. Wow what a wonderful asset she is to this company. Not only her knowledge, but her bubbly personality is enormous. Jib made this whole experience one that I will be telling everyone I know who comes to Bangkok that they MUST do this The food was excellent and there is so much of it. Upon returning back to our apartment we collapsed into a food coma. We did have our driver take us home ( in our great disco Tuk Tuk) which just made the whole night end perfectly. Thank you Expique. This was an experience to remember."

The flower market was an eye opener. The amazing thing about this trip is that you didn't see other tourists besides our trip attendees and this made it special. We got to sample different snacks during our trip and amazing desserts in China town. We never would have tried any of these foods on our own. The tuk tuk drivers were also so friendly and added to an amazing experience. It was exhilarating and quite scary at times . Loved every second of it. 150 baht gets u back to your hotel after the trip with your tuk tuk driver. Well worth it.I highly recommend this trip. We all enjoyed it thoroughly.

We decided on the Bangkok at night tour and arranged for our guide Esso to meet us at our hotel although using the Sky Train it would have been easy enough to meet him at the designated meet point. It was just the four of us on the tour and right from the start Esso seemed like a friendly and knowledgeable guide. First stop was Klong San Market on the south side of the river which was very much a local market with food stalls and clothes. It was lovely to experience a local market without the tourists. There was a time for a bit of shopping while Esso was picking up snacks for the journey Next stop Wat Prayoon temple, again on the south side of the river on the opposite side of the Memorial Bridge to where we were this morning. The temples themselves are closed at night but beautifully lit up and the grounds are so peaceful. We sat here to eat our snacks, Palm sugar rice cakes and bread with this amazing green dip ( must try and remember the name!) Back then to the north side and up to the Giant Swing which was actually a giant swing used up until the 1930\u2019s when someone swung a bit too much and fell to their death. Now it is just the frame. I\u2019m really not quite sure why they don\u2019t take it down.  Our supper was at Thip Samai, the place to go for Pad Thai and still made to the original recipe. With queues of people outside, we were lucky to have a fast track ticket (Esso) but any wait was more than made up for by watching the guys cooking. This place was a treat and the food delicious - definitely worth a trip! Then it was onto the lovely Democracy Monument and Wat Pho, home to the sleeping Buddha. Again the actual temple containing the sleeping Buddha was closed at night but the site was so peaceful with no one around and looked stunning lit up. It was then back to the Flower Market which at 10.30pm was still not reaching its manic peak (about 3am) and then our final stop China Town for our desserts and where we found the most amazing fresh pomegranate juice.This tour is a great way to experience the city especially if you have limited time and we'd definitely recommend our guide Esso"

It was a really beautiful and sureal introduction to Bangkok. The flower market was also great fun, and an amazing experence, like nothing either of us had ever encountered. Throughout the evening, our guide Jib introduced us to a side of Bangkok we would never have sought out or stumbled upon ourselves, and she judged the tempo and energy levels just right.

It was such a fantastic introduction to the city, and even better that it was done at night time so not a lot of other tourists crowding the few places we visited. Our tour guide spoke excellent English and was very entertaining! He gave us great historical background on how Bangkok came to be, how some of the temples were built, and many other historical details I would have never known. Not only that - but he was funny and engaging, even when we peppered him with random questions about the city (both historical and current)! He kept the tour very interesting and never once harassed us on giving him tips (as I heard many other tour guides tended to do). We were with one other couple, and we very willingly tipped him at the end of our tour as he was so fantastic. The tuk tuk experience was really fun. Our driver was so courteous and professional, and even offered to take pictures for us as we were near some areas. Like the tour guide, he never once harassed us on tipping. He took us back to the hotel after our tour for 150 baht, which I had no problem paying as it was around 11:30. We found out (by asking) that these drivers works everyday from 7 AM to Midnight, yet they still had a smile on their face the entire tour. I really appreciated that. And one last item that was really near and dear to me - my boyfriend who came with me is lethally allergic to peanuts, and I had made a note on that during confirmation. We were so worried about eating the pad thai as well as other street food (which btw was absolutely the best!). The touring company saw my note and wrote me a personal response indicating they will ensure no peanuts are on the tour, and went to a great lengths to confirm with the restaurant that no peanut oil was used. The tour guide made sure the snacks he brought were all free from peanuts. I know it doesn't sound like much but no other touring company during our trip made such a great effort. They were so attentive to us, that I felt like a personal guest for a family. That really made me feel good about this company as they care so much about their customers.I highly recommend this tour and I will definitely go with this company again for another tour the next time I am back. Thanks, Expique!"

We whizzed around Bangkok on the Tuk Tuk and it was fabulous. Stopped off at numerous temples for photos and as it was evening, there were no crowds so it was perfect. Simon took us to a restaurant for delicious street food and it was as though we were a group of friends rather than on a tour. I would recommend this to everyone. Thank you Simon for such an enjoyable first evening."

Our guide, Natt, was energetic and knowledgeable and we learned a great deal about his country, its religion, its food and its people. Plus it is a heck of a lot of fun beetling around in a Tuk Tuk. We also enjoyed our small group of travelling companions - 6 nationalities in the 9 tourists and one guide. They all were very conscious and worried about us old folks. I should also mention the drivers were extremely polite and helpful. My wife has had a knee operation and wherever possible the driver would pull up alongside the curb or some other raised surface so she had less distance to step down or up. Greatly appreciated.Being able to see the temples and palace grounds at night when it is cooler and without crowds is a definite plus. We also ate delicious food and treats, most of which we would not have ever tried on our own. We were also given a small sheet with half a dozen very handy Thai phrases (like \"thank you\"). A nice touch.One additional item, Simon was extremely helpful in advising on our other itineraries, even though they were not with Expique. A rare courtesy in any country.I really wanted to rate them a 6 out of 5.Kenneth G"

This tour definitely stood out to us, visiting places at night when no one is around that are normally packed with tourists every day. You also get to taste some of BKK street food which is interesting. Anyways you meet your guide for the evening at a designated spot easy enough to find. On our night we had guide Esso he was great and full of knowledge. He took care of us and gave us time to look around and take photos , never felt rushed at all. The flower market was awesome and great to see Bangkok so alive. Going around from place to place in tuk tuk is great and Esso made it a point to ride in each tuk tuk. and talk to us all. The only small disappointment was that we thought we would be stopping for pad thai at Thip Samai but we didn't, perhaps that's changed now which should have been indicated. Anyways our group was small only 6 persons in total which means you get more of a personal touch. I would highly recommend this tour if your in BKK and you want to do something different than the normal touristy routine. Well done Esso and well done expique we had a great time."

Within 45 minutes we were at the meeting spot and greeted by Eso and another friendly guide. They were both very professional and gave us time to stop at the nearby ATM. We took the BTS from our hotel at the Pileon Chit stop.Soon we were on our way whisking through the bangkok night traffic. We stopped at a local market Khao San, where we visited a temple with a statue of the most famous monk in Thailand and the back story behind him. Eso even tells you how thais check to see if someone is a ghost or human being. I've heard similar versions of this technique in Nigeria! Fun! You get 10 mins free time to walk through the market....an of course I ran straight for the street food stalls. I'll eat anything, anywhere, anytime! My wife visited a few purse shops and we haggled away!Soon we were on our way on way to the river, saw some masive stupas, the local flower market, drove by the grand palace and more. Your night ends in china town which is fantastic on its own. We ended up spending a few hours walking around and taking in the sites. Overall, we really enjoyed this tour and Eso was just great to talk to. He is a well informed man and clearly well read."

It was a very easy way to transport to the next stop and on the same time allowed us to look around in this fascinating city. One of the things that we also really liked was the visit to the temple Wat Pho by night. We already been there during the day, but than it was crowded and hot. With this tour, we walked around in this temple area by night (it is open all night). The light on the temples/stupas was really pretty and since we were the only visitors it was a quiet and peaceful place in the busy city.

Initially a bit concerned to do a Tuk Tuk Night Tour, but all my hesitations disappeared when I met with the Tour Guide, Tip, and her helper (whose name has slipped my mind). Tour guides were so friendly and sweet. Tuk Tuk drivers were nice too! What a change from the other Bangkok taxi/tuk tuk drivers! Locations are pretty cool. They provide you with a number of snacks, that you probably wouldn't try on your own. Take you to the \"most famous\" pad thai restaurant where you eat the most delicious pad thai wrapped in eggs (omelet style).I really have to give Tip kuddos for being so energetic and friendly throughout the whole trip. It can be so exhausting and she was so excellent the whole time. They take pictures and then send a shared album via email. Thanks!!!Since this particular tour ended up on Chinese New Year, they were not able to drop us off at the usual end point, being China Town, where my hotel was. The Tuk Tuks took us as close to China town as possible and the tour guides actually walked me to my hotel to make sure I got back safe. Wow! That was awesome. Cannot say enough good things about them! Mary"

En route we saw dilapidated houses & structures some dating 50 to hundred years old. Instead of marbles, tiles, gold & silver, some structures and buildings are adapting contemporary style as the new Bangkok. On one side are tall 3-storey buildings with pastel colors but on the other side are lumber & bricks in plain colors. On our first stop it rained hard so it took away our 1st 30mins of the tour. But it was ok since we had a chance get to know our guide Ms Jib. She\u2019s a local but has been to the Philippines & USA so communication was smooth. Part of the tour is visiting a market. It is quite small but clean. We also saw some hawkers selling fresh fish, noodles & fried snacks. We stopped at a local seller to buy some candy shaped like fruits & some sticky rice. We went through old warehouses with spices, buffalo skins, etc. Part of the tour is to see various small churches, mosques & temples of different religions since these form part of the Thailand\u2019s diverse culture. The Chao Phraya experience was only short. There are other old landmarks we could have visited but we missed some of them because of the rain. We were also trying to catch the sunset over Wat Pho by 5:30pm. Still we missed it as it was cloudy. (aargh!)"

With only a day and a half in Bangkok, we found this night tour on TA and it was perfect for our Arrival night. Only two or three people to a Tuk Tuk (great fun way to get around), so my wife and I had one to ourselves, as did every other couple. Basically you whiz around the city in an open air taxi caravan making half a dozen stops with a guide or two to narrate, educate, entertain and even feed you (typical snacks, and a good Pad Thai in a very busy, colorful place). Our tour went by many landmarks, to a couple of temples (only half open at night, but uncrowded, cool and well lit), an old market and the Wholesale Flower market and Chinatown \u2013 plenty to see, photograph, taste and absorb in 4 hours. The tour is probably not appropriate for small children as it's late; even the jet lagged adults were tired by the end, but worth every minute. Finally, I highly recommend the small surcharge to pick you up at your hotel, taking you by public transportation to the start point, especially if it\u2019s your first time to BKK. The elevated trains are crazy busy during rush hour and traffic (car/taxi) seems to never move. You will also want the Tuk Tuk to drop you home at the end of the tour for a modest taxi fee (about $5 USD). Bravo."

You are introduced to a few of the must-see sites by night - and get some key points on their background and history. We were also given several photo opportunities we otherwise wouldn't have had throughout the evening. Although the temples were closed, we actually were able to look around the grounds of one - the magnificently lit Wat Pho Temple where the Reclining Buddha is located. The visits to a few of the local markets - especially the All Night Flower Market was great! Our guide Taum did a great job of introducing us to several highlights of Bangkok - and Simon, the owner of the company came along for a most enjoyable evening. They both did a great job looking after us, introducing us to our Tuk-tuk drivers and making sure we were safe and comfortable during the tour.We enjoyed different local foods that we might not have taken the opportunity to try otherwise at the local night market at Klong San, and later during our trip, to a famous noodle shop, and for dessert, to Chinatown.My only disappointment came at the end - when our tour was over. Four hours went by very quickly during this very enjoyable and interesting tour! We all had such a great time, we didn't realize it had gotten so late! Luckiy, Simon and Taum had made arrangements with our well marked Tuk-tuks and drivers to stick around and get us safely back to our hotel for an additional fee, but that was really worth the few extra dollars at that hour!This was a very unique half day tour at a very reasonable price - something we could never have done on our own!

Seeing Bangkok by Tuk Tuk also added to the ambiance. Our group had both first time visitors and locals, all of them had a good time!Great local good - At times it seemed that a culinary tour was thrown in for good measure which was delicious with \"Bangkok's best Pad Thai shop\" as a standout.

You will definitely not be hungry after this tour.Insider knowledge - Simon and his team really went the extra mile in providing some background to the city and \"unlocking\" treasures.

In all these years I've never done a guided walking tour, which is surprising as I've done them all over the world, so I was very excited to sign up with Simon for his Tales of Talat Noi - Bangkok's Chinatown Walking Tour. It was a great experience - very relaxed, very informative and very interesting. There was a nice, easy-going small group of people and we walked through amazing, off-the-beaten-tracks of old Bangkok - historic, atmospheric buildings; wondrous, colourful Chinese temples; and glorious river views. Detailed explanations of the history of Bangkok brought the unique area to life. We stopped for tasty drinks and snacks along the way - all included in the price. It was so good that we went back ourselves a few weeks later to relive the experience, and we will be back again.That was so good that we just had to go on another tour and joined the Diversity and Harmony Tour in Thonburi, just over the river, yesterday. Well, that was even better, just loved it. It's the place of the old capital of Thailand, before Bangkok on the other side of the river. It's largely forgotten now - we didn't see a tourist in sight. There are no tall buildings. The locals live in old wooden houses at least a century old. The streets are a maze of alleys. Shop houses everywhere and still traces of the old Portuguese, Moslem and Chinese communities. Everyone is so friendly and it was just great to be among them. Esso, our guide, was excellent - he used to live there and his grandparents still do - so it was a privilege. We stopped at an amazing family bakery with 2 tables, where the one cake they produce is based on an old Portuguese recipe. Now we can't wait to go on another Expique tour!"

If you love food, markets, temples and want to see Bangkok in action at night via Tuk Tuk and walking (which is a really fantastic way to experience Bangkok) I would highly recommend the Tuk Tuk evening tour. Jib, our guide, was friendly, super knowledgeable and kept everyone together and engaged at all the stops.This tour was one of the highlights of my trip and was a great combo of sightseeing, riding the tuk tuk and meeting interesting vendors at the night market.Next time you are planning a trip to Bangkok definitely sign up!"

It was a great experience to see the city at night, the night market, flower market and other sites. The dinner spot was chosen very well, exotique and mostly with locals inside. Our guide Jib was also very nice, she was polite, kind and gave too many tips for us for the rest of our stay in Bangkok. On the other hand our Tuk Tuk driver was extraordinary compared with the regular tuk tuk drivers in Bangkok. Overall very professionally managed tour."

Can't say enough good things about my experience with ExpiquePre-trip - I found Expique's website when I couldn't book it over Viator (Night tuk tuk tour offered is Expique's tour but because of some glitch, it only lets you book for 2 or more) and googled to find the home page. Booking was easy and payment was secure over PayPal (this isn't the case with many Thai tour company)Night time Tuk-Tuk tour - On the day of tour, Simon informed me there was no one else signed up but they would either gladly give me a private tour at no extra charge or refund me the fee and invite me over for Thai-Christmas dinner with his friends (how incredibly kind is that?!). since I was on a schedule, I opted for the private tour. I met my tour guide Jib with no issues at a Sky Train Station and started our tour. After a long day of sightseeing and jet lag kicking, I wasn't feeling my best. My tour guide was so attentive and tried her best to keep me as comfortable as possible. All the sights you'll see are simply breathtaking and my guide was incredibly knowledgeable, which kept the tour very interesting. (The tour was on Christmas Eve and Expique Tour was kind enough to decorate the tuk tuk all Christmasy! It was all around awesome) The tour starts at a local market where you get to meet the locals who are genuine and kind. The temples at night time will take your breath away as well! After the temples, we visited the flower markets which was such a great experience. The tour finishes in Chinatown for delicious dessert. My hotel was far out of the central area but the tuk tuk driver and tour guide were kind enough to take me home at a very reasonable price. To summarize this wasn't your boring \"let's haul these people in a tour bus\" kind of tour. It was an experience of being immersed into Bangkok for the night in the most fun way possible (riding in tuk tuk is simply awesome!). If you're heading to Bangkok, you absolutely need to check this tour out! Thank you, Expique, again so much for the unforgettable Christmas eve in Bangkok!"

With 2 nights in Bangkok, we didn't have much time to waste in touring, but I'm so glad we chose the night tuk tuk tour. Esso is FANTASTIC. He is incredibly knowledgeable in Thai history and the city of Bangkok and he's very down to earth, funny, and approachable (and is fluent in English). The best part was getting VIP entry into the Thip Samai for the best pad thai I've ever had in my LIFE.. and I am a pad thai connoisseur. There seemed to be a 20 to 30 minute wait into the restaurant, but Expique arranges a table for you immediately. We of course rode around in tuk tuks for our entire trip in Thailand, but with this company, you get to tour the stops and the tuk tuk is waiting for you to take you to your next destination once you're done. We also got to see Wat Pho at night. Let me just say that we saw Wat Pho the next day during the daytime sun and with all the crowds, and it was literally a difference between night and day. At night, there was a tranquility and peace among the grounds and it offered better picture taking opportunities. I loved the city of Bangkok, and if I do get to go back, I would book for this tour and any other tour that Expique has to offer. They are really very good at what they do and I loved Esso as a tour guide."

The sites were fascinating: old warehouses, hidden mosques, ancient Chinese temples, narrow alleyways, a wonderfully peaceful park, and a Christian community that produces special snacks, with friendly locals providing some Christmas spirit. All of it in one easily walkable tour near the riverfront, with a knowledgeable guide who had all the interesting backstories. Even though I expected a lot already, I was surprised how much diversity was really to be found in this small area. I recommend this tour highly for people who want to get to know Bangkok better and like places off the beaten track."

I have seen \"the sights\" and wanted a more intimate look at the city. On other trips, I picked up the habit of taking a photo tour because you often see things standard tours do not cover.I contacted Expique to join their photo tour on the weekend but, due to short notice, they did not have any available. The owner, Simon Philipp offered to put a variation of two of their tours together and asked a very reasonable price for a personal tour. He said he did not have a photographer to lead the tour but a very knowledgable guide who could point out interesting sites and able to talk to people to make them relaxed for photos.Natt was my guide. He was friendly, personable, and spoke very good English. Although Natt was not their \"photography guide\", he told me he had earlier been a wedding photographer for five years. He was most helpful on a couple of technical photography issues.He was most helpful as we walked the first road in Bangkok and explored the alley ways connected to it. We saw a major temple, a major shrine, a mosque and the first church in Bangkok . As we walked, Natt told me the history of the structures and the history of the people connected with them, i.e.the Portugese were the first to visit Bangkok and set up a church.Best of all were the photos. Natt approached people, smiled and explained why the strange foreigner with him was pointing a camera at them. Everyone was so friendly which made the photos nicer and more genuine.The tour was great, the highlight of my trip. I got to see a totally different side of the city and had a unique tour / photo experience. If Ihad more time, I would take another tour with Expique, a first rate , totally professional company. But, that will have to wait for next time ...and there will be a next time."

We went out to a temple on the night tour and got lucky and witnesses a Chinese-Thai funeral happening with a fire ritual. I had been in SE Asia for nearly a year and never saw anything like that. That just gives you an idea of the carefullness and specialness that these guys have put into creating great experiences for visitors.

I have done official tourist tours in the city before and this was definitely off-the-beaten track with a good range of visitors and we saw a lot more character across the city than usual. It was very well organised, interesting and manage-able given the split between boating, walking and the time spent at different sites. Recommended!"

Besides walking through the back lanes of Bangkok and seeing the way of life of the locals, the tour also covered religious places including a mosque, Portuguese church, Buddhist temple and Hindu Temple. This tour was simply amazing and our guide was always extremely helpful in taking pictures for us without any complaints. She had never once made us patronize any tourist traps along the tour too.I guess our only complaint for this tour was the relentless heat from mother nature which made it all so fun when all of us were crumbling under the scorching sun (even our guide was dying too).A definite must go!"

Simon met up with us at the beginning of the tour and talked with us about his life and asked us questions about ours.

Never having been to the city before we wanted to experience some kind of tour which would enable us to leave feeling that we had got to grips with what makes the city tick, insofar as this is possible in such a short time!The Tuk Tuk Night Tour did just that. My wife and I came away buzzing, albeit pretty tired when we finished. Our 13 year old daughter loved the riding about and the proliferation of cats on display, although she maybe found some of the facts and historical information a little heavy going. But not so for my wife and I - Natt is truly an enthusiastic, deeply knowledgable resident of the city and his experience and insight made for a remarkable and fascinating night out. Thank you to him and to Simon. I highly recommend this tour, especially if, like us, you are limited for time in this extraordinary city."

This is definitely a great walking tour for fit people who want to discover an off-the-beaten path destination in Bangkok without the need to go to far flung places. We explored the Thonburi area in depth with Expique's energetic guides Esso and Namo. It's great to experience the laid back lifestyle of people on the other side of Chao Phraya river. I enjoyed watching the day to day lives of local people unfold, hopping from one temple to another and walking around the charming back alleys of Kudeejeen. Local snacks and cooler drinks provided were good, perfect to cool off from the heat during the pit stops. Thonburi is definitely a great place to immerse yourself with the local culture in depth without the chaos and scam artists typically present in major Bangkok tourist sites (ie. Grand Palace). Do not forget bring your umbrella for a more comfortable walking tour. If you will be on a private tour during summer, it maybe a good idea to request the start time of the tour to be earlier than 8:30am to avoid the mid-day Bangkok heat.Detailed review and more photos can be found here: http://asiatravelbug.com/blog/thonburi-back-streets-with-expique-tours/"

I felt that they wanted me to have an unique and memorable experience.I also like the fact that the engage and support the local community.I live in Bangkok and spend a lot of my time exploring the city by bicycle and on foot, but was excited to see things from the perspective of others.I hear great things about their night time Tuk Tuk tour as well!Great job Simon and company, keep up the good work and keep exploring!"

Having been to Bangkok previously we decided we wanted a different experience so finding Expique, Experience Unique seemed sensible.We first booked a tour to Ayuttaha. The pick up at our hotel was on time and in a very comfortable vehicle, suitable for 2 couples. We immediately got on well with our guide Or who was charming and very knowledgeable. Through the Bangkok traffice to pick up another couple, with whom we had much in common. It did not take too long to get out of Bangkok with Or adding explanations whenever we wanted.Our first stop was at the Royal Summer palace. This was beautiful, with marvellous houses and gardens. Or gave us a vast amount of information in just the right way. On to the ancient capital of Ayuttaha. Once again Or's guidance and commentary wase xcellent. Or and our driver then timed things perfectly to get to the boat which took us back to Bangkok. Indeed this departed within 5 minutes of our boarding and Or taking us to our reserved table and an enjoyable meal. A very relaxing way to travel. Once we landed in Bangkok our driver was waiting to take us back to our hotel. An excellent day out.The next day we enjoyed Expique's Harmony and Diversity walking tour, with an excellent guie. This took us to parts of Bangkok that we had not previously explored and we were fascinated by the different communities and cultures living closely together.We are certain to recommend Expique to our friends"

Before the tour we visited almost same sights but doing so at night is a whole difference. Cross the river by boat, visit the temple, eat phatai at best local place, flower market and tuktuk. All at night and for an excellent price."

We\u2019ve been to Bangkok many times and visited various sites both on tour and independently. This is the first time that we\u2019ve ventured off the beaten path and really experienced the living history of Bangkok. We were amazed at the cultural diversity, felt very welcomed by the local residents, and were fascinated by the temples, churches, mosques, and traditional homes that are rarely seen by foreign visitors.Mout was a very congenial and knowledgeable guide - really enjoyable to spend the afternoon with. Capping the day watching the setting sun over the Chao Praya was a perfect end to a fun, fascinating tour."

They managed to pack so many different things into one exciting evening and it really allows you to see some of the highlights of Bangkok in a different way. It's also quite pleasant to be able to avoid the heat of the midday sun. Particular highlights were the flower market (which really comes alive at night!) and having some of the best Pad Thai in Bangkok. Highly recommended!"

I travel a lot and so the run of the mill tour experiences just do not work for me. Unfortunately, the options that my hotel presented were exactly those - boring, generic, herd mentality. Not at all what I wanted.I searched online for \"unique day trip Bangkok\" and Expique is one of a handful of results that I got. I shot an email off to each of them explaining that I wanted a personal tour that was somewhat spiritual, involved nature, involved some activity (e.g. biking), and got me outside the city. Expique got back to me right away and worked with me to create a day that worked for me. They crafted a day tour that was not even on their standard menu but that was perfect for me. Exactly what I had hoped for. My Thai tour guide was excellent. He spoke perfect english, was very engaging, very knowledgeable. I learned just the right amount of information to make the activities interesting and meaningful without becoming academic, like being in a classroom. That is really an art on his part. He took me to some important landmarks, but also to some out of the way spots, which is always great. And he was just fun to be with all day. Also important.In fact my personal tour day was so good, I signed up for Expique's \"Diversity and Harmony\" walking tour the next day. That was also a good time. They took us into some more off the beaten path, but incredibly interesting and photogenic, neighborhoods. Exactly the kind of glimpse into the real life of a city that I love. One of the guides had actually grown up in one of the neighborhoods, which made it extra special. This company knows what they are doing and enjoy it. I highly recommend them."

During our 3 days trip in Bangkok we did a tour with friendlygointer to the floating market, Tiger feeding and Elephant bath that I want to share our experience.Floating Market was an amazing experience. We took a paddle boat through many canals around the market where Thai people are selling things. We were also had chance to try a wonderful duck noodles soup&ice cream from food boats along the canals. Spicy and nice!Take a photo with tiger and spend time with them were very exciting and exhilarating things we have done on our holiday. Generally tigers seem to be happy and lively. They're not drugged, chained or tortured. It's really incredible experience and the highlight of our trip.Elephant bath was brilliant, but for us this was my great experience. We got excited as it's our first time to ride and play with such a huge animal. It was fantastic sitting on his back and got him splash water over us! The whole time with the elephant was my unforgettable moment.The day was a long day, but it was a day we will never forget. Every part of the day was brilliant. My guide Mr. Chen took care of us so well and watch our belongings when we played with the elephant. We can not recommend the tours highly enough. We very much enjoyed our package tour and spent a perfect day out!"

He was very patient with us, even if we wanted to take plenty of photos, haha. He was our tour guide slash photographer. He even provided us with bottles of water for every stopover. I wasn't able to go with my mom on our second day tour to Ayuthaya but he even accompanied my mom to buy medicine for me and my mom said that she learned a lot from Tawee during their Ayuthaya tour. Mr. Tawee is a true profesional, very punctual and courteous. He also kept on reminding us that we need to be careful especially when crossing the streets and with our belongings. The driver was nice too. Ms. Ampasri responded to my emails immediately and she answered all my queries. Thanks!"

We went for the option of 'guide-only' because we wanted to try all the modes of transport and really experience the city. Tawee was very good in explaining all the details and had great amount of patience. He understood our vegetarian requirements and guided us to the right restaurant as well. The first day was the regular Bangkok tour.Based on our first day's experience, we booked the second day as well with him. This time it was outside Bangkok (floating market, rose garden, crocodile farm, elephant farm etc). We took the guide + car option. Once again Tawee was able to plan and time the sessions very well so that we did not miss any part. He also ensured we went to these places when they were relatively less crowded.Tawee then arranged for our dinner cruise as well. Having found out that it was our wedding anniversary, he stayed back until the dinner was over and we were back at our hotel before he signed off. So sweet of him."

I cannot express how impressed we were with our private tour given by our tour guide, Tawee! We toured the temples, ate an authentically delicious Thai meal for lunch and then headed out on a tour of the canals. I have to say, Tawee spoiled us with our experience in Thailand. He very much felt like a knowledgeable friend taking us on a tour of his favorite parts of the city. He not only taught us about the history of the temples, he taught us about the beautiful people of Thailand, their language, culture, religion, etc. Thanks Tawee for an incredible/memorable experience! If you don't use Tawee, you're missing out on an amazing cultural experience."

We're happy to share with the rest of the TA community that we were very pleased with the trip! Staff courtesy and tour organization was top notch.The start time from the hotel was very manageable. We boarded a bus northbound about ~65 km to visit the popular palace grounds, the famous ruins, and several other historic wats. I think the best part about the day trip was that each stop on the tour offered a little something different (oftentimes, the various drop-offs on tours I've taken in the past begin to feel alike.) You'll see.Feel free to shop from some of the eat/drink stands and/or the great artists posted up at some of the attractions. They were not a nuisance but colored the experience even more. By the time we boarded the cruise back to Bangkok, I wasn't even hungry... my fault, but even so, the buffet aboard the cruise was so tasty. I listened to the cruise narrator the entire time and I'm glad I did. There are just so many interesting things ini the city along the river.Overall a very recommendable way to see Ayutthaya, and also Bangkok's Chao Phraya."

We wanted to see something different for our children so we booked chokchai cow farm with ice cream making and visited a new place sun flower field on the way back to Bangkok. Friendlygointer arranged us a driver and a tour cooperator who speaks good English to lead us there. Everything went smoothly as we expected. The driver drove very carefully and be on time help us whatever they could do. Cowboy show at the chokchai farm was great. Children were happy to ride a pony. The biggest cow fiend I've seen in my life under ozone weather and green grass were still my memory all the time. Our children enjoyed making an ice cream with special formula and later ice cream instructor packed the ice cream we did it for us. On the way back we enjoy visiting huge sun flower field which was so impressive. The big yellow sun flower bloomed waiting for sun shine. It was really enjoyable trip for us. Do recommend anyone who likes something different and thank you for great service they gave to our family."

His fluent english plus his long time experience made my day trip in bangkok the most fantastic unforgettable experience. He also know the good view point in every place we went that made our photos very memorable. Though the grand palace was not currently used by the thai royal family but we were blessed by visiting such a art masterpiece of collection in the huge palace. I heard that the trip in bangkok is not complete, if you don't go to the grand place but it will be more colorful if you have a guide who knows the real history of bangkok so well. Thanks very much for making my day truly superb. I'll contact you again for my next visit I promise."

I had a dream of going to the ruin of Ayuttaya--the old capital of Thailand as I was told Ayutthaya has never rebuilt and the area was declared a unesco world heritage site since 1981. Once the reservation was confirmed online, we were informed by e-mail about what we should and shouldn't do, also what we should take it with us like umbrella, sunglasses, sunblock, etc. so the tour went smoothly the whole day. Exciting war between Thai and mianmar history was told clearly by our guide all the way long to ayuttaya by comfortable brand new van. Hence when we were in ayuttaya we had no wonder why temples turned into ruins and were deeply impressed by thai architecture. We and our guide walked along side by side without rush, plenty of time to explore temples and thing around them. It was extremely great to take time as we had children with us. Lots of photos were taken again and again. It was my unforgotable moment. Elephant riding among ruin temples was really amazing and also the highlight of the day. If you want relaxing tour, I highly recommend this travel agency."

I and my family including my children had a holiday for a week in bangkok. Am provided me full detail perfect tour arrangement from top to toe, since transfer in until transfer out. All details were sent to me clearly involved what were included and excluded.  As the indian family, we were informed we could do a visa upon arrival so we decided to do it in bangkok'a airport but was found later it took long time to get it. I was afraid a driver wouldn't wait for us as I took a night flight but once we came out, the driver was there at the meeting point. The van was comfortable and brand new one. The day tour with Mr. town was great as he's on time and knowledgeable. He always had a story to inform us everyday with his fluent clear english. The guide surprised us a lot by telling us about lord buddha's story, his culture, thai life style, ramayana story, etc. Especially, ramayana story he knew so well so he made our city tour full of detail and we've learnt that anuman--the powerful white monkey, in thai version is not a bachelor. The day in pattaya was fun especially tiger zoo, believe or not, nong nuch village. No need to worry about indian food as our guide knew the indian restaurant and took us to the inexpensive one. Thanks very much thai new found friend. We'll return to thailand someday and difinitely will contact you.Pradeep and family"

We got to see different sights to Bangkok, so much more to see and explore that goes beyond all the LED lights and signs for bars, massage, souvenirs and of course 7/11s! I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it absolutely barmy cycling on the crazy roads of Bangkok traffic but also quite enjoyable and exciting. I always felt safe and comfortable with On, absolutely fantastic tour guide with impeccable English and full of interesting information. Highly recommend going with ABC for a cycling tour around Bangkok! Thank you once again to On and thank you for the photos, they are much appreciated."

Unfortunately it was raining, but my guide Edi (not sure how he spells it) and I still went out. Being from the UK, I'm used to the rain. So we headed out in our ponchos onto the streets of Bangkok. I found it really interesting hearing about the different cultures and exploring the different neighbourhoods.I caught my first ever long boat across the Chao Praya river. I don't know how they managed to get the bikes and passengers on the boat without it tipping. We travelled across to the green heart of bangkok, cycled the paths through the coconut and banana trees. It was a totally different world to the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.Thankfully by the time we got across the river the rain stopped. Even with the rain this was a brilliant day out and I would highly recommend the tour to people travelling to Bangkok. I'll be back in November and hopefully the weather will be a little kinder, but I would definitely do it again."

It is absolutely safe (if you can ride a bike).We went also into the so called 'green lung' A district where you find (palm) trees and where the quitness is super after the busy , dirty roads.When you book this tour you will enter places beyond imagine (meaning that as a tourist you will never do or find this, so expect the local experience) Did you think the Thai people are laughing all the time ? It's more than all the time, so friendly !And what about coffee? Well that's another story: the coffeemachine was bought 32 years ago and still is working perfectly! So Starbucks or other coffeecompanies: Eat your heart out, this is not to be matched.As you see, my review is very positive so I will give my only negative comment of this tour: We had to stop at the end of the day!Enjoy it guys!!

He was an excellent guide--I can't recommend him highly enough! For food-obsessed travelers who love to bike, this was pretty much a perfect itinerary. Early on, we took a series of small alleyways to the Khlong Toei Market, where we picked up some fruits that we snacked on later. Marcel did a good job of keeping us together and protected during the portions when we had to go through the crazy Bangkok traffic on busier streets. And when we went across the Chao Phraya River, it was beautiful biking through the jungle on the wood paths. Marcel bought a huge range of little snacks for us to try at the floating market, and then we biked more through the plantations, stopping for lunch at a little restaurant, and then headed back across the river. Throughout the tour, Marcel was both charming and knowledgeable. And the bikes were good quality and well-maintained."

The trip took us through an interesting mix of markets, alleyways and (busy) main roads to a quay side boat, which ferried us (and our bikes) across the river. There we had a good view of the city for a while, turned a corner and then spent part of the day cycling through the countryside, crossing bits of jungle and various villages. Sometime in the afternoon, we turned another corner on a jungle-path and were amazed to see the Bangkok skyline across the river.... Throughout the tour, Marcel kept us well informed about our surroundings, paying close attention to our safety (and wellbeing) at all times. Thoroughly enjoyed this tour and would strongly recommend it."

The bike trip was entertaining, and you really got to see the hidden side of Bangkok. Throughout the trip I felt safe - even when riding the narrow concrete bridges in the jungle. And when Jeppe fell in, On was quick with the first aid needed. If I make my way around to Bangkok again, I will definitely contact ABC again. On, if you are reading this: Hope the night toilet story amused your friends."

Had a wonderful day cycling around BKK and BKK Chao. saw the city from different perspectives like I could almost feel like a local and experienced a rich culture. When on lots of twisted and narrow roads, it was like I was out for an adventure in a jungle. I thought my day would pass ordinarily but this was the most special bike trip I have ever had. Though this is Songrek festival season in Thailand, it didn't affect this trip! In fact, it created a joyful environment to ride around since the traffics were also not heavy. City bike is really comfortable, too. Thanks, ABC and Aong, for this wonderful experience."

We were 40 minutes early and they made us coffee (the best we've had so far in Asia) and sat and chatted with us. You see a really interesting side to Bangkok down the narrow windy streets that I wouldn't have otherwise seen and the plantations are so peaceful and refreshing compared to the city!

I went on the weekend floating market tour and found it a great way to see more of the real Bangkok which is hidden away amongst the sky scrapers and shopping malls down the back streets and alleyways. Fascinating to watch the locals go about their daily life, especially in the local markets. The best part of the trip was crossing over the river to cycle around in the \"green lung\" and trying out all the thai snacks at the weekend market where we were the only tourists. Our guide bought lots of the different snacks for us to try and ate so much that didn't really need the lunch that was provided at a local restaurant on the way back!I would definitely recommend the trip to others although you do have to be a confident cyclist as you are sometimes cycling along and crossing over 6 lanes of traffic on the way to and from the river and the concrete paths in the green lung are narrow and raised off the ground with some tight corners!My only slight criticism was that I arrived in plenty of time for the tour and then we had to wait around for others that were late so instead of starting at 10am it was 10.40 before we actually left. Also a basket on the front of the bike would have been handy."

The tour took us through the city, and then across the river (by boat), to the bike trails and a totally different bike ride- it was nice to get both city biking and \"country\" biking.

We asked for helmets; a small investment and should be a must for any operator of a bicycle tour company, but the request was dismissed on the grounds that there are no good helmets available, esp. for kids... Any decent bike shop in BKK has them in stock! Overall a nice trip and we all enjoyed it."

I have visited Bangkok on more than one occasion and felt I had seen many of the major tourist attractions, undertaken Thai cooking classes (very good by the way), and walked many miles exploring. I just wanted to experience something more about Bangkok, hence booking the cycle tour, with promises of not passing one major tourist attraction. Three of us choose the ABC Day tour (10:00 to 15:00) along with 9 other tourists. We had a great initial brief with owner and our tour leader Michiel Hoes, he broke the ice with us all to understand what we could expect from the day and teamed us up with our bicycles; loads of choices and well maintained. We started off around the back streets close to the office to find our feet and then on out into the more back street areas and tiny workshops; watching shoes being made. We also cycled under motorways through tiny narrow alleyways leading past a multitude of small shack-like homes and some amazing local (what we may incorrectly call slum-like) backyards experiencing local Thai smiles and waves everywhere. We cycled through a fresh market, the colours sights and smells were incredible then across the river with our bikes and cycled out around the lush green plantations on concrete raised \"footpaths\", stopping for a local delicious lunch cooked for us and then wending our way back again. Cycling single file we were encouraged to just stop and take photographs whenever we wanted - a guide is provided at the front and back of the tour, so that no-one gets lost or left behind, it was well thought through, from many years of experience. The day we cycled was very hot for me (35 degrees C) and humid, whilst most of the ride was in shade I would personally reccommend a light hat that gave you some sort of shade protection (not one that makes your head heat up underneath). Water was provided to us on the ride and a welcome cold drink and frozen hand towel on arriving back. On the couple of times we cycled briefly on city roads I was surprised how safe it felt, as a driver from another country I always felt the roads here looked a chaotic place but actually when you're on it you realise the drivers are not pushy and inconsiderate - there's just lots of them, it was big lesson learnt for me. You are not allowed to carry any bags or backpacks with you on the tour itself (they are all locked in the office) - I guess to not have any incidents with dropping them off or you loosing your balance when cycling the platforms through the plantation, so I would reccommend a very small light nylon bum bag or neck hanging nylon 'container' for your phone, camera or small sunscreen tube. You don't need any baht on the tour itself as everything is included unless you need to stop and buy some more water. The tour was 100% flat and easy cycling for any level. The three of us really enjoyed experiencing \"real back street living in Bangkok\", it was one of our parties 4th cycle tour here and the paths are slightly different every time. Loved it and would really like to try another one."

During the first part of the ride we meandered through back streets - sometimes very narrow back streets - where we saw all different types of homes, businesses etc. When we reached the river we, and our bikes, were loaded onto a boat to be taken across to a very \"rural\" and green section of the city. On this side we cycled along \"country\" roads and over a series of narrow raised pathways. These paths were a bit unnerving for me but added to the adventure. There were no hills - all flat pedaling so the ride was easy from that standpoint. Michael our guide was very friendly and enthusiastic. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone who wants to see another side of Bangkok."

Despite the fact that we arrived in the middle of a thunderstorm and heavy rain, we set out with our great guide Michael and embraced the weather. Unfortunately the others who were booked in for the day had decided against showing up due to the rain, but this didn't affect our experience in the slightest! Definitely learnt a lot more than expected and saw a side of Bangkok that we didn't really know existed. Cycled for a few hours but wasn't any more than moderately challenging. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Bangkok, whether it's their first or tenth time."

We cycled through Bangkok \"slums\", markets, the old China town and Bangkok's Green Lung by crossing a river on a small boat with our bikes. We did stop at one of the less popular temples (not popular with tourists) where we got to see a mummified monk, hear his story and learned about the proper ways to show respect at Thai temples. There were opportunities to stop at a clean toilet and our kids (ages 9 and 12) had no problem cycling the 18/19 kilometers, it was an easy ride. Bangkok's traffic was not a problem, our guide was very efficient and knew how to guide us accordingly. This was no problem for our young family. ABC's is a very efficient and reliable company.

At first, visit of some BKK neighborhoods that the normal guest will never reach alone (ie the former Chinese enclave). To follow with a public market selling most of food stuff and other merchandise at incredibly low prices. Loved the attitude of Thai people having a bunch of westerners biking among their ... legs while being quite accommodating to this hassle. Biking through a slum, built and nested under a bridge, met some wonderfully smiling local faces with the purest of intentions. Great choice to include this part in the tour. A pleasant short boat trip to the other side (probably the West Bank south of BKK), visiting Bankkachau area where we tried delicious Thai food and recommended dim sum. Lots of interesting souvenirs, typical local foods and plenty hawkers and buskers amidst green surroundings. Biking was quite relaxed and amusing passing through at times an interesting 1m concrete trail on top of river-water surrounded by lush vegetation.This is a wonderful eye-opener biking tour in areas the average guest to BKK will not catch on his own.I kindly suggest the explanation of the tour be given at the beginning and not the end of it. I also politely advice that useful info is shared when all the guests are present as in the case of 9 guests if you happen to be the last you may lose some interesting knowledge.It is certainly a well organized and highly recommended \"using-a-bike\" tour.

The cycling paths are thrilling, because they are very narrow and if you don't be careful, you might fall like in a muddy scary watery area. So if you are a regular cyclist or a fearless person it is fine. Otherwise you are going to annoy the rest of the group who is up for any challenge. Having said that, the pace is very slow, so it is very enjoyable for non regular cyclists. The market that you cycle through in the city has some weird stuff such is dead frogs being sold. The one in the middle of the jungle is lovely and get to try some really different nibbles such as Miang kham (I think that is the name)! We loved it! The guide, Tom, was by far the best English speaker of all the tours we did. He also takes lots of pics of the group along the way whilst still cycling on his bike! It came handy for my husband and I who broke our camera the day before the tour! The only thing we got a bit disappointed is that we thought we read in the tour description that we were going to cycle past a floating market but we didn't. Apparently this time of the year it is all very dry for it. Other than this, it was fab!"

My boyfriend and I joined another group with two girls -also from Denmark, a girl from Germany and two guys from the Netherlands. Our guide was oh so sweet (Aon) and told us about the attractions we stopped to see, and took us around Bangkok, seeing both rich and poor places, markets etc. I never thought I would be able to say that I've tried riding a bike in Bangkok city - but now I can, and I'll never forget it! So if you go to Bangkok, I would certainly recommend this trip!Thanks to Aon, and to the group - it was a pleasure! :)"

A bicycle tour is a fantastic way to see and gain a better understanding of the holiday destination you are in and having taking part in one in London and loving it, I was keen to do the same in Bangkok. ABC Amazing Bicycle Tours Bangkok did not disappoint - in a word the tour was excellent. Ja was our guide for the day which in the afternoon was a relatively small of only 6. What a fantastic time we had. The route itself was fantastic and allowed you to see many different parts of Bangkok which you simply will not see if you stick to only taxi's and trains. Ja was good fun and very knowledgable and at our various stops along the way explained to us the area and the type of living that occurred in that area. The trip is great for all ages. I went with my 14 year old son and we both equally enjoyed it. During the trip you ride on roads, paths, through markets, through a jungle area and take part in a very pleasant river crossing by boat. There are plenty of opportunities to take photographs. A snack break takes place at a local eatery. All in all, this was a very enjoyable 4 hours and well worth the money spent. I recommend ABC to you. Their high rating on Trip-Advisor is well deserved."

The guides are local Thai women, so you get a firsthand perspective of different parts of the city.I did the 8 am trip, it ended up being longer than what they said so give yourself some extra time after. Super interesting to see the different classes lifestyles, especially cycling through the tunnel slums! So cool. You get to cycle through a market and eat lots of yummy fresh fruit! There's lots of water and other beverages provided so no need to worry about bringing stuff. Super going going through the jungle on these narrow little lanes, all the while learning so much about the inhabitants of the land and the nature around. The guide takes a tonne of pictures, so you have lots to go back on, they're posted on their fb page right away too which rocks. So cycling is pretty mellow, even when going through super busy streets in Bangkok the tour guide is just an absolute pro so it's no problem.The only reason I'm giving very good instead of excellent is because I ended up being the only single person in a group of couples. I know, kind of a vapid reason but I really wish there would've been a way to pick a group that I could have mingled with more. The group was still great though and I still thought it was a blast."

Wear comfortable athletic clothes that wick sweat, sunglasses, shoes that stay on.2. Can choose cruiser bike or mountain. Cruiser is obviously easier to pedal.3. Guide is a rock star! Bring plenty to tip her with because she is the best. Made the best cup of coffee I had in the entire country. She will also provide T.P. (Western style toilets). 4. Guides provide plenty of snacks & drinks. 5. Guides will keep you safe! I was apprehensive due to the traffic, but immediately felt taken care of. 6. Biking is easy, but there is manuerverability required on the raised sidewalks. If you are a nervous driver simply walk the corners!7. Keep an open mind and enjoy truly seeing the city. "

Normally, I fly in on Sunday night and am gone by Friday. I see the office, the hotel, and a few restaurants for supplier and team dinners. This trip I was moving on to Singapore & Myanmar on Sunday, so I decided to try a different tour experience - I had already seen the Palace, temples, etc.The afternoon bike tour was the best ! Ja is a fantastic tour guide, but also a great representative of Thai hospitality and culture. I never knew we could get from the city to the rain forest in by just crossing the river. Great contrast in lifestyles and conditions. Got me away from the concrete jungle and traffic of Bangkok without having to travel north or south a great distance. HIDDEN BENEFIT - 14 km's of exercise bike time !!! No need for the hotel gym on that day.This is a great way to spend 4 hours in Bangkok. Would highly recommend it to anyone here on a business trip with a morning or afternoon to spare. Beats hanging out in the hotel checking emails. Give it a try."

It was clear Marcel was well respected by the locals given his command of the local language and his years of experience traversing the streets. Cee's looks defy her age and she was extremely polite and full of charm. As for the ride itself, it was mostly flat terrain, through back streets where possible.

The tour takes you through narrow streets, busy streets, and the \"lung\" of Bangkok or the jungle if you like. You pass the river in a small boat to get to the jungle. That was a perfect short rest before entering some really cool bike paths in the jungle. We were a group of 8 and everyone clearly enjoyed the trip.

It is a fantastic opportunity to see areas of Bangkok that you would never find or think to explore without a guide. Was so impressed with Tom who took time to get to know us and explain about Thai culture, life in Bangkok and its history.The tour includes regular stops for pictures, information, refreshments (fresh fruit, drinks and snacks).

We would stop on side streets and discuss the city living, and had many great photo opportunities. The guide got us some fresh, local fruit to try and it was delicious! We also got regular cold water which was well needed!When crossing the River, the tour changed and we explored a side to Bangkok I didn't know existed and never would have! Jungle, swamps, little lonely wooden houses and silence but the sound of nature. Incredible! These cycling paths were fairly narrow, and being raised with a swamp the other side I certainly took my time around the many 90 degree corners.

However, we realy recommend doing this tour if you want to experience Bangkok in a not so usual way."

You'll not see the most famous sites of Bangkok on this tour (which I guess it the point), but you'll get another view of Bangkok - the less travelled roads by tourists and the poorer parts of town. This is a great way to move a round the city and our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. Please keep in mind that while most of the tour is on quiet roads without much traffic, there are a few stretches with quite a lot of traffic - so if you do this tour with younger kids, they should know how to bike in traffic."

He took us through the backroads of Bangkok, away from the chaos of the city. We got to see how the people here actually live and get a taste of another world than our own. We then crossed the river and bikes through the jungle a little and through a beautiful park. The whole time Marcel was very funny and kind, giving us water and snacks along the way. I would really recommend this to people who are looking to see a more realistic view of Bangkok!"

The bikes are in good condition, the tour guides and explanations are friendly and easy to understand. Even a flat tire kept us stranded for only about 10 minutes (well done). The tour is versatile, you drive on busy roads, small roads, walkways, backyards and sometimes it felt like driving through the people\u2019s living rooms. Another highlight is the crossing of the river with a long boat. Recommend it to anybody who is not lazy to ride a bike."

She speaks great English and was very helpful throughout. She also ensured we were safe on any of the busier roads. We did the 'Day Tour'.The tour goes through a number of suburban streets just outside of the city. You get a good look at locals living their everyday lives.The highlight for me was the market visit. It was amazing seeing the way things are done at their market. I won't list everywhere we went after that, but will mention that the lunch was also fantastic.I can highly recommend this tour."

On this tour you get to see such a variety of Bangkok life from back streets, that you would never find on your own, market areas, river life (loading the bikes on the boat and crossing the river is great) through the cool green forest on the other side. The fact that the concrete paths here are narrow and on occasions high up, with some tight turns means you have to concentrate, it adds to the excitement and they haven't lost anyone yet off the path :)It is hot cycling at this time of year but the bikes are easy to pedal and the breeze cooling.

At beginning I was a bit worried of the traffic and safety however later of our trip we had no issues and no more concerns. Michael started to lead our group into these side streets of Sukhumvit road in Bangkok, we started to see many different things which we could not or be able to find these interesting places on our own, starting from the shoes factory in the small commercial building, a tuktuk fire truck stands by, Klong Teoy wet market, through the low rise small houses and later we all put our bikes into to the longtail speed boat accrossed the Chao Praya river to the other side which is green opened area. It is such a contrast scence from busy Sukhumvit street to this peaceful place, biking along the vegetables fields. I end up recommending the ABC Amazing Bangkok Cyclist to many of my foreign friends, some as a couple and some with their kids. I had few couples who came to Thailand for their honeymoon and they told me that the biking trip was the highlight of their honeymoon. Strongly recommend !!"

We had heard from friends about the bicycle tour and they specially recommended ABC.When planning this Holiday with my husband and two kids (6 and 12). we decided to make time for this trip on our time in Bangkok. The e-mail was replied so quickly and to all my questions they had an good answer with explanation, you can see they took time for this. Expecially for the youngest kid I was slightly worried in Bangkok traffic but they assured me it would be fine.We booked the weekend tour with the local market hidden in the jungle. When we arrived a bit early we were about 30 minutes early but, this was no problem at all as Marcel, the manager I think he was make the best coffee from Bangkok for us. We were introduced to another smiling lady which her name was Djaa. She would be the tour guide for today. There was another family from Holland of 4 but just before we left a couple from Belgium came walking up who wanted to join the tour. As this would make the 10 of us total Marcel didn't make a problem at all and joined us on our trip to make sure everyone was safe and well taken care off. We cycled through the city and saw placed that we really never would have found by ourselves, the fresh market was a real highlight about the city part but also the huge differences between the big fancy buildings and the wooden shacks under the highway. Also for the kids this was very education and entertaining to see different lives of the people. On the way Both guides provided us with some interesting information but not too much, they made a lot of jokes which made it a fun experience for everyone. After we crossed the river we came into the green jungle. No cars anymore just peaceful green surroundings. we made our way over the pathways to the hidden market in the jungle. Here we parked the bikes which apparently don't have to be locked? as they assured us everything was safe here. On the market they give us all different kinds of tastings which even the kids liked :) they were truly delicious and with the Thai karaoke on the background is was a great experience without any other tourists around us. After the market we went to a nice local restaurant where we had some delicious lunch before making our way back to the boat. On the way back my little one was getting a bit tired but luckily Marcel noticed this and took my son at the armand so helping him making our way through traffic. Marcel up front and Dja cycled ahead to block the traffic to make sure we all could pass safe every intersection which gave us a super safe feeling. When we got back at the office we were all four tired but very happy. The kids loved it and we as well. Marcel and Djaa took great care of us before, during and after the tour. they made sure we were with a group. We exchanged e-mails with the Belgium couple and Dutch Family and shared some great pictures for this memory!We traveled with the four of us in various countries but this was definitely the best thing we did. Well worth the money!!Visited, December 2013"

Did the 4 hour long cycle of Bangkok in January whilst travelling with a friend - we booked at our travel agents in England but were so glad we did! The tour guides were lovely and very inciteful of the city and spoke good English! We saw different ends of the scale of Bangkok from the slums to main roads. Also went over a river boat to an island we didn't know existed and saw a beautiful mosque! We had a great day very relaxed ride for any fitness level and free water was a bonus as it was boiling. Would do it again and recommend to anyone wanting to tour the city!"

We didn't really know what to expect but were excited. The tour guide, Boom, speak very good English and was easy to understand. Our tour group was pretty big but we were able to stay together pretty well. The tour doesn't take you through the main tourist attractions of Bangkok, instead it takes you through the different sorts of neighborhoods including a bit through the \"poor\" area under the bridge. The highlight of the trip was definitely the floating market across the river. I'm not sure we were still in Bangkok honestly, but the food and merchandise in the market was so awesome. The tour also visits the Chinatown market that people say is 24/7 with its busiest time at 1 AM in the morning. This was a great little site, but extremely frustrating to walk around with a bike. The road is very tight and there are people everywhere. After a little boat ride across the river, we rode around a narrow path that was above water with very tight corners. It was honestly a very stressful little bike ride around this path, but we needed to take it to get to the floating market (which by the way...does not float. This tour does not take you to the well known floating market in Bangkok. It takes you to a local one). Looking back at this tour, the best part was all the food we ate during the day. We got to try some of the local fruits and snacks - it helped us on the rest of our trip around Thailand. But again, do not expect to see any tourist attractions - no temples, no famous sites. You will be riding around as a local."

Just a group of crazy tourist on bikes riding along motorcycles, buses and cars. Everyone got back safely, the drivers on the road are very aware of motorcycles, in turn they were aware of us bikers and gave us room as well as the right of way. Not a long trip back but not something that you would do never do by yourselves for sure. Have fun and see the real Thailand."

In the jungle over the river on to an elevated walkway over some water (you definitely don't want to fall in) with the occasional stray dog and 90 degree turns make it exciting but doable by most anybody on ABC's easy to ride bikes.

All throughout the ride, we were offered information and tips about Bang Krachao, the people, and any ad-hoc questions we had along the way. A trip to the floating market on Bang Krachao was included in the tour, where our guide became invaluable. She picked out lots of different food for us to try (way more than we could eat) all included in the tour price, which is an awesome idea. She was able to explain what we were trying and really bring incredible local food to a place that was accessible to us as first-time visitors. On the way back to the bike office, we did get a bit of a downpour, but our guide was ready and prepared with rain ponchos that got us back totally try.

Highlights were walking our bikes over a creaky wooden bridge that looked like it was from \"Swiss Family Robinson\"; wheeling our bikes onto the dock to take the longboat ride across the river; and of course, riding on the elevated walkways in the jungle/swamp in the \"Green Lung of Bangkok.\" Riding on the elevated walkways (no railings) was exciting and at times a bit scary for me. I am a very experienced cyclist, but I do have a small fear of heights and falling off things. Our personable tour guide, On, confided that a number of cyclists on their tours do fall off the elevated walkways each year, mostly just getting wet, but some with serious injuries, so I would hesitate to recommend this bike tour for the timid cyclist. Also, we got a little hungry during the ride (we did the morning ride which started at 8 AM, so no time to eat breakfast beforehand), but there was no food offered during the ride except for a junk food stop very near the end of the ride. Other quibbles: contrary to what it says on the company website, there was no wifi at their office, and no fruit offered during the ride. Our tour guide On did a great job of getting all the participants to bond as a group and entertaining us during the ride."

I was in Bangkok for a mere 3-days -an extended stopover on my way back to NZ from Europe -and given that it was my first time in Bangkok I was really keen to find a fun and low key way of getting a better sense of the city. Cycle touring is most definitely the way to do it. I was lucky enough to be the only guest so had Ja all to myself -she is such a lovely, friendly, knowledgeable, capable and safety conscious guide. We biked through a range of different neighbourhoods giving me a really good insight into the range of ways and locations that people live. Ja would stop at key points to give me insightful explanations as to where we were about to go, what we were about to see and useful background information. A few highlights for me included seeing three giant monitor lizards foraging on the banks and swimming in the river, a collection of pythons awaiting for relocation away from human habitation, the settlements under the motorways, the boat trip across the river and biking through the plantations on the other side, meeting a few locals, and learning and testing out a few thai words.

On our April 2013 visit to Thailand we decided to go on a bicycle tour with ABC Amazing Bangkok Cyclist tours and it turned out to be the highlight of our time in Bangkok. Our group of 6 had 2 guides, new bikes, and a wonderful afternoon. It was a great way to see a lot of the area in a short time. We started with a fresh coffee, drove through low, middle, & upper class neighborhoods, walked through a local, bustling market and shared some local snacks, crossed the river on a long tail boat, visited a small shoe factory, drove through the nearby countryside through a banana plantation, and stopped in a roadside hut for pad thai. It was very reasonably priced for all it included, and was just a ton of fun! Our guides were so knowledgable and fun and friendly. We all felt like we got to know each other and were part of something really special."

For two of us it was the first time.It was for me a surprise that a tour on the bike was a possibility.It was a very pleasant thing to do. The two guides Marcel and Ohn did it very well and with lots of humor. They led us trough parts of Bangkok which we don't should see if not do this bicycle trip.The bikes where in good condition, the drinks enough. Especially the market was very nice to view. We had a nice group of people, so all four of us have enjoyed the trip.We can recommended everyone to do this trip if they like to bicycle in Bangkok."

On a recent business trip to Bangkok I wanted to get out and at least see some of the City, a friend suggested a bike tour and ABC seemed to be one of the few companies that offer half day tours, which was perfect for my needs. From the time I booked I was impressed with the service, a prompt email response, clear and accurate instructions on how to find the starting point and a welcome glass of water and a good coffee on arrival. The bikes are all of a good standard and Michael clearly knows his way around the back streets and alleyways of Bangkok. It was a great four hours and truly a different way of discovering the city."

I was apprehensive about visiting the slums, however it was in interesting insight into another side of life but better than that those that lived there seemed so happy with shouts of hello from most doorways and children high-fiving us! The highlight for me was taking the bikes across the river in the long tail boat. Am our guide was great, we had a brilliant tour, thanks guys."

Our very knowledgeable and extremely enjoyable guides showed us in 4-5 h easy drive, the different aspects of the daily life of the Bangkok people, from poor to rich, in the City center, pourer suburbs around Bangkok , under highway bridges. Taking a long-boat, we crossed the river and biked further in a kind of jungle, with small concrete road for walkers and 2 wheelers. A lot of people working in the city AND also growing crops on their own land live their quite nice houses. As additional attraction we had a severe rain storm during our \u2018jungle\u2019 meal and biked back, in a soaked Bangkok. Besides our 4p family we were joined by the two guides and a very nice couple Rose a Drake.Highly recommend this type of visit to Bangkok, easy and flexible."

It was a great way to enjoy the city and to see the real contrasts of East meets West. We were a small group of 4 and our excellent and knowledgeable guide provided us with really interesting facts and information. We boldly went where no man has gone before ( well not many tourists at any rate). We did wonder about how we would cope cycling in such heat but it wasn't a problem. We had a brilliant afternoon and saw a side of Bangkok which we wouldn't otherwise have been exposed to. It's a must do experience."

As an avid bike rider in New York City this was right up my alley.Ahn (An, Ann) was our English speaking leader and took us through the most amazing section of Bangkok, no cars, fumes and annoyances here...back roads, small neighborhoods and a jungle on the other side of the Chayo Praya river with a raised cement bicycle/walking path.This was definitely a highlight of my 3 weeks spent in Thailand. Ahn is a great leader and answered all of my dumb questions that I had about Thailand in general and took the time to explain sights and places in and around Bangkk on my map after the ride when I am sure she just wanted to get the hell out of there. Ahn deserves a raise and a promotion at this company, she really made this experience very cool. I have been promoting this company since this day for 3 weeks now to whomever I meet in my travels as a must do activity when you arrive in Bangkok.I would have to say that you should be a pretty competent bicycle rider. There are some pretty narrow areas on this trip and as a veteran city bike rider I was a little concerned so, I can imagine, Betty from Ohio who has not ridden a bike since 1972 should not do this ride. Strategy negotiating the pathways and not hitting people, market stalls, children and dogs is a necessity.The raised platform in the jungle took some getting used to.Definitely consider this ride if you are an experienced bicycle rider and ask for Ahn to lead your trip!"

On the other riverside we rode on an elevated walkway through some kind of plantation.I loved every minute of it. We've seen lots of interesting places we never knew existed.

Our tour guide was really knowledgeable and had lots of interesting information about the area and the people that live there, and she even taught us some common Thai expressions.The best part of the tour was on the other side of the river as we rode through farmland on narrow elevated pathways. The floating market is definitely where locals shop and our tour guide let us sample lots of great food (including quail eggs, a weird fruit called gac, fresh fruit popsicles and lots more)!

I think that distinction comes from the fact that you start in the hustling, bustling, smog filled crazy streets of Bangkok and then go to the peaceful, green farmlands across the river. You couldn't have two more opposite atmospheres. Our local Thai guide, who went by her easy name of Nikki, was very informative. She even cracked a few jokes which was impressive in her second language.The biking is very easy. Most of the time you are on paved and flat roads. Some will be scared on the streets of Bangkok as you are riding right next to the traffic. But you are in a large group, so the cars can see you and it's only about 5-10% of the trip."

During the tour we felt really safe in the traffic due to the proffesionalism which the guides had. but most of the first half we cycled in the backstreet which were a secret to all of us. From small factories till local markets. Our guides knew plenty of information which for us local Thai people was new as well. Later we crossed the river by longtailboat where we cycled in the nature area of Bangkok. All 10 of us never been there and we've been MISSING OUT. What a wounderfull change of scene and surroundings. Fresh nature smell and narrow paths through the jungle which were very fun.

There the guide explained about the Thai way of life in Bangkok. Afterwards we \"walked\" through a market and had a small stop to taste some fruits.Then we rode to the Bangkok river where we visited a temple. For us it was the first temple to see and our first encounter with a monk. We took our bikes on a boat to cross the river. There we drove through the \"jungle\" .

Spent a long time in the \"jungle\" of Bangkok which was awesome for the first hour but a little repetitive after 2 hours.The ride is slow and on flat ground and would not require any fitness. The jungle paths are somewhat narrow and wet and covered in moss, whilst any competent rider will be fine, its probably not for someone who hasnt ridden much.The only downside was the ride through traffic at the start and the end. Personnally not too bothered as I ride regularly in traffic, but I was surprised we were riding without helmets. Our local colleagues were horrified we rode down the major roads stating they would never do it and certainly not let kids do it."

Our family of 7 persons enjoyed an amazing cycling tour with Michael as guide through Bangkok's small sois, over the river Chao Praya and into the green lungs of Bangkok on the other side of the river.A tour that gave us an insight into the citizens lives, away from the bustling city mega stores etc.Very recommandable."

You will be cycling on the busy roads (depending on your time slot) and 90 degree turns but for those who are willing to brave it out will be rewarded with a really fun day out.I took part on a morning tour for half a day. This included drinks, some small snacks, a short long boat ride ride and a tour guide who was very friendly, knowledgable and funny. She was always interested in the background of the people in the group and alwaya provided information on thai culture.Thank you for a fun day! Thoroughly enjoyed the experience."

The bikes are good quality and well maintained....seats v comfy for irregular riders! No problem with photo stops and plentiful drinks and snacks are provided. As they supply everything e.g sunblock, water you do not need to worry about carrying a bag on the bike, all you need is a camera. We did the afternoon trip and it was 4 hours well spent and a lovely alternative to temples, markets and shopping malls. The ride takes you through interesting aspects of the daily life of the city and a boat takes everyone and bikes across the river. The rest of the trip is on a peninsula which is largely park and wetlands so you cycle on raised paths through coconut plantations etc, quite fascinating and beautiful."

At 1000Bht for a morning tour in which water/drinks are included its incredible value to be able to see sights of Bangkok and Thailand you might never have seen even from walking. Our guides Marcel and Nikki were fantastic. Both knowledgable, friendly and funny. Most importantly though they made you feel safe and well looked after. With my experiences of Bangkok roads, I was slightly worried about how I would fare on a bike, but with Nikki and Marcel front and back, I didn't once feel concerned. Cycling through Bangkok is an excellent way of keeping cool in the heat and the cycling is a gentle gentle exercise suitable for a wide range of ages and abilities. The route is flat which adds to the ease of the cycle.On arrival you are provided with water and if you want, a hot drink (the coffee is the best in Bangkok, so if you like your coffee, I advise you take advantage!!). Once everyone has arrived the guides run through a few rules and you choose your bike. The bikes are brilliant for both the road and off track with brilliant suspension and the seats are very comfortable. The first part of the ride takes you through the back-streets of Bangkok offering you a glimpse into the world of Thai's behind the main strips of the City. A long-tail boat ride across the river leaves you in a world apart surrounded by the greenery and silence of Samut Prakan, where you cycle on concrete paths around a metre wide - but don't panic, the thought of it is by far worse than the practice. The long tail boat ride back across the river is a refreshing break before the return to the busy city. Water is provided throughout the journey by ABC and there are plenty of opportunities to take photos of the people and sites you see. If you haven't guessed, I would completely recommend this as a must-do when in Bangkok.Thanks to ABC for such a special morning and experience - we will be back!"

Its great.You need not be fit, however you should be comfortable on a bike and NOT be too confident - go within your limits. There are some narrow elevated concrete paths that you must navigate slowly (balance!). No need to rush! I walked around some corners rather than topple off. Give some braking distance between yourself & the person in front of you.And enjoy the contrasts of greenery & the high density living under the freeways. It's like no other part of Bangkok."

On & Kai were fantastic guides and as we only had a group of 3 we were able to stop where ever whenever we wanted for photo opportunities etc. The whole tour is on the bike no busing to starting point ! After taking the long boat to the other side of the river the fun really started with the feeling you were miles and miles from Bangkok, not another tourist in sight. If you go on the weekend you will be treated to a local floating market where you get to try all kinds of treats. Most of the cycling is on raised concrete pathways with sharp turns every couple of hundred metres. Just makes for an interesting ride ! Lunch provided at a very local open air restaurant which was great. Really easy to find from the web directions and just a great escape from the hustle and bustle that is Bangkok. If this is your first time or 10th time to Bangkok, I think you will aprreciate this \"out of the box\" experience."

We had two guides - one local lady whose name I have no clue how to spell, but we were asked to call her 'cha' and a young Dutchman who joined a couple of months back (the company is also owned by a Dutchman). I'm a pretty active traveller, always trying to either do some sports locally or at least hike/bike once to see places in another daylight, and for me this tour was therefore one of my highlights of visiting Bangkok! Biking through the busy Bangkok city traffic, seeing more residential neighbourhoods you'd otherwise not see, and crossing the water to a much greener place, which was as I understood not part of Bangkok itself - but so close, it was amazing to experience the difference.Both guides had plenty knowledge about the places we went to, were very kind and I felt comfortable biking through the city with them. I'd definitely recommend anyone who's fit and confident to cycle in a whole different setting (I always say this, knowing from experience living in Amsterdam, not all tourists on a bike here should be renting one). And if I do decide to visit Bangkok again especially with my significant other who stayed home this time, I will make sure to reserve some hours to cycle again!"

Not all for the faint of heart but colorful and hopeful. Across the river to the jungle of Bangkok on narrow walkways and a stop for great food. I thought I would be scared of traffic but felt safer than I do riding in the US because all the different vehicles watch out for each other. You don't have to be that fit, just adventurous. Since this trip, I look for bicycle tours everywhere I travel. Definitely the best thing we did in Bangkok."

While on the ride, you see things that you would never see yourself when walking around the city - it really lets you see what the real Bangkok is and how the locals live their lives. We stopped at a market in Chinatown for a snack, and Bo picked up some things that we would never have picked for ourselves. She taught us what each thing was and how to eat it. Then you go across the river to the floating weekend market and do the same thing. Bo picked out some snacks for everyone and we tried all sorts of great Thai things that you'd never pick out yourself. Then we stopped for lunch and made our way back across the river. Overall it was a great experience and one of the stand-outs of our entire 3 week trip in SE Asia."

He was really knowledgeable about Bangkok and we loved all the little alleys that we rode through. We saw a Bangkok up close that we would have never have experienced any other way. Peter looked out for our youngest and our kids especially loved the break to feed the turtles. He then showed us to a little market where we had a delicious lunch. Would really recommend this tour, the bikes were great and you don't need to be a super fit cyclist to do this."

This was a fantastic way to see Bangkok - biking through the alleyways of the city, and busy markets, then alone through temples and parks when everyone else has gone home. A great mix of chaos and calm. Bikes were in great condition, Peter our guide was great, tour was individualised to us and he was always aware of safety and how we were doing. We loved it."

I asked for a tour not listed on their Website: the green jungle of Bangkok. They are doing it, just ask for it. It was a very personal tour with Ray himself as I was the only customer for that tour that day. And it was fantastic, very well worth seeing that part of Bangkok. And there was a nice floating market stopover that day too. Ray is a fantastic guide and knows quite a bit. And he had his fun as I jumped from the river crossing boat too early right into the mud which I thought was solid sand .... Mud happens :)So highly recommended as a bike tour company."

I did the tour without any guide (just GPS) and this was by far one of my best experiences in Bangkok that I had during my numerous visits to the city. The tour shows you a completely different face of Bangkok, away from the tourist crowds and you have the chance to enter into a new world where you will ride through numerous small alleys, markets, along the riverside, see churches, temples and other interesting places not listed on the standard tourist maps. You will drive away from big traffic and the route is not very challenging besides the high temperatures in July.For anyone visiting Bangkok, aiming to see the city from a different perspective than the average tourist, this tour is an absolute must. The staff is very friendly and helpful and you will get an unforgettable experience."

            "review": "Best Bangkok for your Buck. Before even setting foot in Bangkok, we organized our biking tour with the manager, Raymond, over email.His responses were professional, fast, and extensive. We already felt like we were in good hands before we even set off.Raymond is a guy from Holland who is fluent in both Thai and English, so there was no miscommunication or uncertainty in the set up of the tour that we wanted.Furthermore, upon arriving, he gave us ice cold water, fitted the bikes to our sizes, and ensured that the GPS device was functioning perfectly. He gave us an overview of how to use the navigational program and made sure we had his number in order to call him if anything went south. After a quick reminder to ride on the left, (Never forget to ride on the left, people), we were off and running.The GPS unit, as with all of them, is accurate to within about 10 to 12 meters, so every now and then it looked like we were riding through people's shops and houses according to the screen, but what we found interesting is that the Thai people nearby are so used to seeing a bunch of sunscreen soaked newbies clamber about in bikes, that they all pointed us in the right direction when we inadvertently headed off trail, which as the ad says is going to happen. This is true. You WILL get lost at some point, but not hopelessly so. You will just find yourself in a small road a turn or two too soon, or something similar. As adventurous as it would be to have to fight your way out of the docks through Muai Thai bashing street gangs, that's not really going to happen, so don't sweat it.The path that you take is certainly unorthodox, which in my opinion is the best part of the trip. You wind through narrow roads, walking street markets, housing rows, coast along the edge of the river for a while, and take a ferry twice. (We did \"Go Gold\", fyi). Many times we thought to ourselves, \"No, it couldn't possibly lead through there.\" Which it did. And after riding through fresh fruit stands where natives are bartering for their produce, or watching people wash their clothes in a basin outside their front door, or hearing cries of excitement erupt from several shop doors at once as the tide in a televised boxing match turns, you find it very difficult to wipe the smile off your face.The points of interest on the trip can be great photo opportunities, but we found ourselves actually enjoying the journey and the experience of biking through the back roads just as much as exploring a temple or sampling native cuisine.The self-guided nature of the tour allows you the perfect amount of control over your experience, and while it is technically titled as a \"tour\", you certainly don't feel \"touristy\" on your adventure. And in my book, there can be no higher praise."

I messed this guy (Ray) around about three times, for various reasons (sleeping in, lost cashcard and phone, etc) and every time I emailed him to explain he was both courteous and understanding, and, FANTASTICALLY, because I was having a nightmare trying to get some money transferred he offered to help me because he spoke Thai - wasn't even bothered whether I wanted a bike or not, just wanted to help. Restored my faith in humanity at a time when I'd had 48 hours of progressively tearing my hair out.In the end I got a great, easy-to-ride (never changed gear once) kind of mountain bike with a lock and lights thrown in. And because I was collecting at around 5pm he never charged me for that day, just for two days - and at 600baht (around 12 GBP) it was a bargain.Had a glorious time negotiating the Bangkok traffic all the way from Silom Rd/State Tower junction to Khao San Rd area, twice! (You need to be confident though because the traffic is busy and chaotic.) I loved it.Thanks Ray, you added a bit of true magic to my holiday. Shaun."

Our guide, Sant, was excellent and set a perfect pace through the small streets and back alleys on Sunday morning. There was almost no traffic or cars to deal with which made the tour very relaxing. Much of the tour was on alleyways too small for a car to even pass through. We stopped at a number of interesting sites, churches, temples, etc. and had 2 ferry rides across the river where we could re-hydrate. Sant also bought us all a coconut ice cream from a local street vendor who served it in a coconut shell -- a great treat for all of us! The bikes were in excellent condition and fitted to the proper size before we started off. Bottom line: a great, if unconventional, way to see Bangkok! Highly recommended!"

I wish I'd taken this tour on the first night I was here as its a fantastic way to familiarise yourself with Bangkok, and work out where you'd like to see more of. To start with the welcome was friendly and efficient. The bikes are a bit like Boris bikes (city bikes) which are great for handling the back streets of Bangkok. Our guide was well educated and had excellent English. The tour itself was fascinating. I went down back streets and alleys that I would never have discovered, or felt comfortable walking down alone. It was great seeing the recline Buddha temple complex at night, a stark contrast to the heat and crowds of the day. The 5pm start meant some of the heat was taken out of the day, however the place of the ride led to a cooling breeze without being zealous. Water provided, a lovely experience. Totally recommend, so much better than the tour I arranged through my hotel. Thanks!"

Great conditions on bikes and great service, it was only the two of us on the morning trip so we could decide where and when we wanted to stop. If you want to see how the Thai people live and work and also learn more about their religion this is a good opportunity to do.

He even had coins ready for us when we had to use the public toilets. The tour starts/ends in Bangrak and includes different highlights such as the old customs building, flower market Wat Pho and Wat Arun. At the market in China Town we had a little walking tour through the main allies and visited a Chinese temple. You cross the river by boat and cycle through different parts of BKK.

When we arrived and began the tour the guide, Peter, felt that one of my daughters cycling skills were not up to the level needed to be safe (among other things she did run into a gate and hurt her foot in the first 5 minutes). I agreed with his decision. We returned to the bike shop and they refused to take any money for the tour from us. I will certainly use this company again when my daughter is a more secure rider because:1. When the cab driver could not find the shop Peter personally came to the area where we were (just a few streets over) found the cab and escorted us to the shop. There shop is actually not hard to find and very convenient to lots of other interesting things so before or after the tour you can go do other neat stuff.2. The children LOVED the tame rabbits in the bike shop and the fish foot spa - this would have been enough in itself to make them happy.3. Ray at the bike shop was super helpful arranging other activities for us, including changing our spa reservations and suggested low cost and interesting activities that the children really enjoyed and are still talking about.4. Peter tracked us down at one of the activities we were at (spa) after we left the shop after the \"tour\" and returned a stuffed animal mascot to us that we had left at the shop by mistake. We have been taking pictures around Asia for a year now with this stuffed animal, so this was really a big deal to us.5. This tour group is very professional and concerned about safety. They also have a fast response time to inquires, reasonable prices, and stellar customer service.I rarely give 5 star reviews - but these guys absolutely deserve it."

Better late than never :) I was in Bangkok in July 2015 and was really keen to join a bike tour. Was scrolling down the list of bike tours in trip advisor and when I clicked the website of Go Bangkok Tours I was captivated by its \"happy and bubbly\" music. At that time, there were only 7 reviews but I trusted my guts and dropped an email to them and it turns out to be one of the best decisions. In less than an hour I got a reply from Ray which amazed me (it was nearly midnight when I sent the email). There were few emails here and there and were all answered promptly and clearly by Ray.On the day of the tour, I reached Ray's shop without any difficulty at all. Thanks to the clear video instruction from the website. I was greeted warmly by Ray. It is such a neat and cosy shop. While we were waiting for my tour guide I was \"forced\" to watch a safety precaution video for the bike tour...not complaining...it was fun to watch. The star of the show is none other than Ray himself. Talented, comical and full of potential. I found out that I was the only one in the tour and was surprised that the tour is still on. My tour guide was a beautiful and lovely lady with a pretty name...Marisa. She is a GEM!!! When you were with Marisa, the whole tour feel like you were cycling with your best buddy. She is very informative, knowledgeable, caring, attentive and an excellent photographer. She was so fun to talk to. The places that she brought me were just awesome. We bike, we travelled by boat and we walked. We had the tastiest fried chicken and the most refreshing orange juices. I learned how to fold the lotus to a lovely shape thanks to the wonderfully patient Marisa. You can never imagine Bangkok is so much more than shopping and eating. So many hidden places to be discovered. So many lanes to be explored. This really is the road less travel....well maybe to me. I have discovered the other side of Bangkok thanks to this wonderful lady and of course Go Bangkok Tour.Thank you for the great fun Go Bangkok Tour."

After a very warm reception at their HQ very near the Sathorn BTS stop, we drove of with guide Peter. Experiencing Bangkok from the saddle of a bicycle is very special! While traffic may seem to be chaotic at some times, the tour is very safe for everyone who can handle a bike. 90% of the tour takes you over squares, markets, back alleys and by temples. Also it was very nice to be in a small group. At Go Bangkok tours they favor small groups over large hordes of cyclists. I would definately book a bicycle tour again at Go Bangkok, and would advise anyone visiting Bangkok to try it from a bicycle."

It gives a unique, refreshing view on Bangkok that even the locals might not have seen! Peter answers any questions you might have about temples and explains Thai lifestyle as you go along the narrow streets of Bangkok. The organisation is run by a Dutch guy (Ray) who knows his bikes. They only do small groups, as they like to deliver a good service and make people happy. They also have a DIY (fiets 'em zelf) tour without a guide - however I would advise to take the first 1-2 tours with a guide to enjoy cycling the best."

Most tourists only see the city from the Skytrain or in a smelly noisy tuk-tuk. Forget about seeing BKK by tuk-tuk, do it with Raymond at Go! I saw sides of the city that I never knew existed. When they say \"back alleys\" they really mean back alleys. You get to thread your way through all of the sights, sounds, and smells of Bangkok. This tour was an eye-opener for me. I cannot recommend it high enough."

Our friends that live in Bangkok took us along this trip and we had Raymond as our great and funny guide. So this is what you can expect, when you book a tour at Go Bangkok...As Dutchies we are used to riding a bike, but we have never biked through the kitchens and what felt like open space living rooms of the local people (the Thai are absolutely okay with you doing that by the way : )The trip literally goes through the heart and soul of Bangkok. It was a great way to dive into the Thai way of living. You will see the touristic highlights if you want to, but you will definitely see places that are normally hard to find. For instance a flowermarket, or an indoor food market where all the smells and colors will welcome you. Or the smallest streets of China town, where people are selling literally everything that you can imagine. Yes everything. Or you will bump into a group of young men that our shouting in front of a television, we thought they were crazy. But later we learned that they were so enthusiastic over a game of muay Thai (and they where shouting because they placed bets on the game : ) So keep your camera ready, cause your will have a hard time to keep up with all the beautiful things and people that we have seen."

I was staying at the Sheraton and wandering around the local area I came across a bicycle rental company in a small alley off Charoen Krung.Having done a bike tour a few years ago I thought... Why not do one again? So the next morning I turned up and found that not only can you get a guided tour you can rent a bike with a tablet pad which has pre programmed routes on it so you can go off on your own and follow the GPS which also has handy notes on the things you can see as you go along!So off I pedaled confident that at least I won't get lost...... Wrong, given my innate nosiness for small alleys I headed off the set route and into the labyrinth of small streets. It was fantastic but now I was lost.... until I looked at the pad and clearly saw a route backonto the trail... It was that easy.I had so much fun and arrived back needing a cold beer but thoroughly happy with my mornings excursion.The pad is easy to use, the bikes are well maintained and with helmets provided. The sights and smells of inner Bangkok are fascinating and bicycles allow you to access even the smallest streets in this ancient area.I'm going back!!"

Along the way we were provided with cool towels and Air helped us bargain with the locals for souvenirs, in the afternoon we had a amazing lunch by the river and Air recommend lots of nice things to try, this was our first trip to Thailand so we welcomed the help although we quickly realised all food in Thailand is amazing. After lunch we took a long tail boat through the back waters of Bangkok and saw the houses where people lived and fished, along the river we saw huge monitor lizards and fed the fish. We also visited the local market where Air showed us the fresh orchids and local fruits A great trip for our first day in Thailand"

The first day was spent seeing all of the highlights in Bangkok, The Grand Palace, riding in a Tuk Tuk and long tail boat and eating a delicious lunch to mention a few. It was extremely hot and humid while we were there and Poy was very conscious of keeping us hydrated with water and cool with frozen towels.The second day we were going to take a tour of the countryside and visit the first Capitol but we changed our minds the night before and decided to go instead to the floating markets. Poy and Michiel were very flexible and revised our day to accommodate our wishes. The floating markets are incredible and something not to be missed.We had 2 terrific days and I would highly recommend BKK Tours."

We were picked up in a luxury van (seemed more like a limousine). Sorry, I can't remember the lady's name that was our tour guide - but she was amazing!We toured thru the Grand Palace, had a tuk tuk ride, walked thru the flower markets (absolutely breathtaking), had a long tail boat ride and delicious lunch. All of this was included in our tour price. Our tour guide asked us for any allergies and dislikes for foods and then she pre-ordered our lunch. It was so tasty! There was lots of food but it was so tasty that she brought us out more of the dishes that were our favourites. The chicken fried rice served in half pineapple - WOW! I had the Sweet Thai Iced tea - one was never enough and she was always ordering us more drinks - whatever we wanted. That is amazing service! During the tour there were always plenty of bottles of cold water.Our tour finished up at their tour office which is located in the Shangri La Hotel. My only tip would be that if you have mobility issues getting in and out of the long boat would be a challenge. My mom doesn't have any mobility issues, however at 71 years old, it was stressful climbing in and out of this boat."

Michiel kindly explained to me that they prefer to show tourists places where we can see authentic Thai life--so no Summer Palace for us, although it was in the area where we were headed (Ayutthaya). Still, I don't regret it, because they even tried to work in Chao Phrom market at my request (it was empty for a Sunday, but that was fine--Miss Petch bought us some fresh mangosteen and taught me how the Thai crack them open). Miss Petch was on time, super friendly, and really knew her stuff. She also bought my sister and me some roti sai mai, which was one of the best parts of the Ayutthaya tour. The tour always took us to tourist spots that had little to no people if these places could be avoided; there was also a great 40-minute boat ride along the Chao Phraya river, and a tasty lunch just beside the same river. The van was clean and spacious and Mr. Popcorn was such a good driver--he always had a box of cold water bottles and packets of cool towels ready for us. The views at each of the Ayutthaya temples we were taken to were lovely, but I think Miss Petch's friendliness, quirkiness, and know-how in keeping up my family's energy accounted for much of the joy of this trip. I look forward to booking with BKK Tours again some time in the future!"

I looked into several companies before booking, as this was by far the best value out of all of them. I did the Bangkok highlights tour - 2 temples, lunch, flower market, and long-tail boat ride. All of which were extremely educational in their own way. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable, phenomenal at taking pictures for me since I was alone, and always concerned about my needs (food, drink, bathroom). She knew all of the ins and outs to make it as best as possible. It's clear that they take great pride in the city they are displaying.Honestly, I happened to read a review or two before writing this, and I was kind of bummed that people have them a negative review. I'm not sure why you would opt for an air conditioned minivan for this tour. Taking the local transportation of Tuk Tuks and boats was awesome and made it more genuine. I also disagree that you could just go see these sights on your own. You could..... but you would miss out on soooooo much information that the guides have to offer you - not just about the tourist sites, but about the people, culture, and traditions as well.If you want an air conditioned van and generic information, then maybe save your money and just watch History Channel.If you want an authentic experience with a passionate guide who will immerse you into Bangkok life for a day, then do this tour. By the end, I couldn't believe how much value there was in the cost. I would hands-down recommend this to any of my family or friends who ever came to visit. Thank you for a great day!"

With considerable help from Michiel I arranged a custom tour to Sangkhla Buri, near the border to Myanmar. Traveling by comfortable minibus from Bangkok via Kanchanaburi I arrived at Sangkhla Buri for a 2 night stay. The chosen hotel was comfortable and next to the wooden Mon bridge. Highlights of this tour were a boat trip visiting abandoned temples and a visit to the Myanmar border at the Three Pagodas Pass. Traveling back to Kanchanaburi we visited Hellfire Pass to walk the 2.5km trail and the following day visited the Erawan Waterfalls, walking to all 7 levels. After a short stay in Kanchanaburi I returned to Bangkok and 2 further day tours with Air. The first was a custom city tour, starting with a visit to 2 small silk factories near the Jim Thompson house. Afterwards we used a public canal boat to visit some smaller temples. The second trip was outside Bangkok by minibus visiting a railway market and 2 floating markets. The railway market was very memorable as we travelled back through the market by train after watching it arrive. I would again highly recommend BKK Tours and the railway/floating markets tour in particular."

We had a good time visiting the temples (2), flower market, and restaurant, but quite honestly, all of that could have been accomplished in a few hours instead of seven. I feel like the tour guide was tasked with maximizing the time spent at each destination because it became very clear early in the tour that $275 for two people going to a handful of places was extremely overpriced. This tour is great for those who have very little knowledge of Thailand, 7-8 hours to kill, and $275 spare change. The fact that we chose the minivan and not the local transport would not have a made a difference in the experience. This tour made us realize that not all Trip Advisor reviews are unbiased. We relied on the reviews to make the decision to go, and we regret it."

            "review": "Superb, Fantastic, Magnificent Tours. Want something truly great try bkk tours. I had read about them on tripadvisor and was a bit sceptical about it. Nothing is this perfect i thought, but boy was i wrong. We booked 2 tours 5 months ahead of time. You need to do so in order to be sure you get them, because they are very popular (and great). 1. tour was Bangkok Highlights with local transport. We saw most of what you need to see in Bangkok and got to ride with alot of interesting transport forms, boats, tuktuk, sky train and the likes. All the time Ms Air made sure we were happy and got Water and food and tastes of Bangkok. If i was to describe in detail what we saw then it would fill several books so i will abstain from that. But everything was described by Ms Air so that we all knew what we were seeing and that in a super way not the boring old historic way.We also tried the Authentic Markets tour and this was yet Again great. I cannot recommend BKK tours enough. Having traveled to Bangkok 7 times these Guys are absolutely the best tour Company and most dedicated people i have met. So much included in the tour that i wasnt expecting. Like lunch, Water, soda, small treats along the way. A boat tour in the floating market. If you want to impress your Family by book a great tour, these Guys are the ones to get hold of. Thank you Ms Air and BKK tours."

I added the half day railway market & floating market last minute from Chang Rai, but Michiel was most helpful and informative and nothing was a problem. Met at our hotel reception by our lovely guide Lucky, the first afternoon & Oi the following day. Both were very knowledgable and made the tours fun and informative. We got to taste, see, travel & more with these lovely guides. Travelling in an air conditioned mini bus to the railway market, cold bottled water is provided and cold refresher towels. We also travelled by tuk tuk and the metro which gave us a real insight! Both tours were excellent. As mentioned we did the railway market & floating market 1/2 day tour and the Bangkok highlights tour. I would thoroughly recommend both. I won't mention too much as do not want to spoil what lies ahead for you! Thank you Michiel, Lucky & Oi for making our stay in Bangkok an enjoyable one."

Our guide, M, was very friendly and knowledgeable, and also entertained our kids. We were lucky with traffic and managed to catch the train - we particularly enjoyed arriving at the railway market by train, it's amazing to see the stalls fold and unfold as the train goes by! The floating market tour included a glimpse of the local shacks, not just the pretty market front. We also got to taste some of the market foods!"

We had their Bangkok Highlight and Ayyuthaya Tour, and a customized tour to JJ Market. Our guide was Ms. Phet and our driver was Mr. Ed and they're surely the best pair and were helping us a lot and made our trip to Bangkok very memorable.Ms. Phet was really informative and had a vast knowledge about the history on Thai. She told us in very detail about the history of each places and managed to seamlessly connecting the histories of each places that we visited so we got the whole history of Thai kingdom. She even prepared us on some history background of our next destination to Chiang Mai/Chiang Rai so we could see the connection between what we saw in Bangkok and Ayyuthaya with Chiang Mai/Chiang Rai areas. Her explanation was so detail and she did everything to make sure that we had all our questions answered with the correct facts. She also gave us a lot of insight about the local customs and about the life in Bangkok. When we visited the food market or as we sat for lunches she also told us a lot of things from the food on our table to some fun facts about the place we ate. She was also very good in accommodating our needs throughout the trip, either for some break from the walk to finding the easiest way to accomodate our limitation. The only time she wasn't really fluent with the situation was during our trip to JJ Market. She was also a little bit lost like us and hardly explained anything but for some local desert on the main entrance. But she did help us to bargain and even informed us if it was a reasonable price. Our driver Mr. Ed was also very cheerful and fun. He never failed to greet us cheerfully and readily with some wet towels and cold drinks. He was also always making sure that the car had the air con ready as we stepped in from the heat of Bangkok. Overall we're very satisfied and impressed with this tour and with the guide and driver that assigned to us."

As soon as I confirmed by trip to Bangkok, I immediately contacted BKK Tours so they could create another customized experience for me. Last year, I had the pleasure of accompanying Air on the Bangkok Highlights tour of the Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaeo and the flower market. I remember feeling like I was exploring the city with a friend who provided a cultural and historical context along the way. This year was no different. In reaching out to BKK, Michiel did a fabulous job of creating a customized itinerary based upon my preferences. He was prompt in his reply and comprehensive in providing multiple options. To my delight, Air was available again this year and took me on a tour of the Damnoen Saduak floating market, Maeklong railway market, and an afternoon in Chinatown. We met in my hotel lobby at 7am and were promptly whisked away in a air conditioned van towards the Ratchaburi province. Along the way, she pointed out the salt farms and we stopped at a coconut sugar farm and we were able to taste the product. So delicious! When we arrived at the railway market, we enjoyed a cup of coffee before strolling along the railway. We were able to view the train's arrival and departure and had plenty of beautiful photo opps. We then made our way to the floating market and climbed into a non-motorized boat which set sail at a very leisurely pace. We were there on a Tuesday, so it wasn't very crowded. This is preferred as I understand that weekends can be very busy. So, if you have the choice, go on a weekday in the morning's. Air discussed the history of the floating market and we stopped by a few vendors based upon my interest. There are many merchants; and, as we strolled along the canal, there is a diverse assortment of food choices and it's fun to see the merchants cook the food in their boats. This was a truly unique insight in to Thai culture and everything you eat will be delightful. Next, Air planned for us to have lunch on our way back to Bangkok. I can't remember the name of the restaurant, but it overlooked a river and the food was incredible. We had traditional Thai Pad Thai, crab with yellow curry, and chicken with cashews. Yum! It's little touches like this that create an experience that is both informative and fun. The van was stocked with cold water, fresh towels, and was so comfortable I was able to put my feet up and recline to rejuvenate as we journeyed from one location to another. Our final stop was Chinatown and this bustling epicenter of Bangkok presented itself in all it's glory. We walked through a market, strolled along Yaowarat Road, and discussed the location and the emergence of Chinese culture in Bangkok. In reminiscing about my experience with Air and BKK Tours, I can honestly say I will always contact BKK Tours when visiting Bangkok if not for another unique tour, but to reconnect with a friend who truly enhanced my trips to Bangkok. Michiel/ Air, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I hope to see you again someday :-)"

I actually quoted 3 different company's, and I stay with this one because they offer me an extra market that was open on weekends, and the other company's didn't even mention it, the driver and guide were on time at my hotel, and we got there on the time we were expected, they actually have a company shirt which give you a better experience, on the quote they told me we will have some test fruits and typical Thai food, which was included. I've been on a different company on Bangkok, and by far BBK Tours gave better service than the other one. And they are a pay pal affiliated company, which is always good."

It was a long day starting at 7am and getting back to our hotel almost 12 hours later but it was most definitely worth it. Our guide Air knows so much about the area and the history of the Thai-Burma railway. It was an incredibly emotional experience visiting Hellfire Pass, the war cemetery and Railway Museum as well as a walk over the Bridge over the River Kwai, a breathtakingly beautiful longtail boat ride down the river and an incredible lunch at a gorgeous spot overlooking the river....one of those hidden gems that only Air seems to know about. There is no way we could have crammed so much into the day if we had tried to organise this ourselves. It is so nice to have a guide to take care of absolutely everything from entry fees, the best order to visit attractions to avoid the crowds, knowing where the toilets are, great photo opportunities, organising cold drinks and snacks from street stalls along the way, not to mention having a wonderful and very skilled driver with an incredibly luxurious and comfortable van (think first class air travel!). We have no hesitation in recommending BKK Tours to anyone who wants a premium private tour experience. It is also an added bonus that BKK Tours will not include any attractions on their tours that exploit animals. We wholeheartedly support their ethical stance."

We were a group of 4 friends so a private tour suited us well as we aren't keen on the much larger organised ship's tours. Best decision we ever made as Ms Petch was extremely knowledgeable and helpful throughout the day. Drove through Chinatown, visited flower market with Tuk Tuk ride and Grand Palace. We then had a trip on a long tail boat up the river/canals and a wonderful lunch ordered by Ms Petch. This was undoubtedly the best meal during our Asia cruise - one of our group is vegetarian and Ms Petch took care to order many dishes to suit everyone's taste.

Here she explained all the different stalls and food and about different Chinese traditions and beliefs. We then headed to Wat Pho, the Reclining Buddha and then on to the Grand Palace. She showed us which Buddha represented our day of birth and different ways of praying as well as being extremely informative and answering all questions we had. As Wat Pho was getting restored while we were there she even took us to meet some of the men working on the feet and they showed us pieces of the mother of pearl they were using and how they created the design, which was a great extra!At lunch she talked us through the best dishes to order and the food was amazing! After lunch we heading on a river boat cruise where we even stopped to feed the fish. We ended the day at the flower and vegetable market which was a great experience.Throughout the day we travelled by taxi, boat, Tuk Tuk and Skytrain which was a great experience. Oi was fantastic!

We had no idea what to expect because I literally emailed the bkk office and asked them to set up a two day itinerary michel was fast in replying to all my emails and explained the payment system perfectly we decided to pay on the two different days the fees for those days in cash on the day. Our first stop was china town. It's a must. Then to wat po (lying down Buddha) I've been here 2 times before but Fiona hasn't. oi was really informative and she was also an amazing host. She saw we was struggling a bit in the Bangkok heat. And got us some cold ice towels much appreciated. After this is was off to the grand palace again as informative as possible due to the shear amount of crowds. We got some pics and then went for lunch. Lunch was lovley oi took us out of our comfort zone and ordered some appetisers for us to try. (Really tasty) after lunch we went on to the river on our own private long boat and went down one of the canals again this is a must. All in all the first day was amazing. You can walk round the templesand sights as much as you want without a guide it's pointless. Oi also showed us how to use the sky train and how to get to various destinations on the night time. I feel I've missed so much off this first day review but there was too much to tell. Second day we was picked up at 7am and off to the train market and floating markets then a trip to a palm plantation and lunch. After lunch we went up a temple to see the view of Bangkok a must see. We really enjoyed our time with oi and feel that we got a great guide who knew her stuff but went above and beyond her duty as a tour guide to make us feel comfortable. Anyone thinking of going with bkk tours. You must. Great company to deal with and if the other guides are half as good as oi you are in great hands."

We reserved the tour on Thursday; we arrived in Bangkok on a Friday, and only then confirmed our booking for our tour to Ayutthaya on Sunday. I was expecting to not get a good tour on such short notice, but I was proven wrong.Miss Petch of BKK Tours met us at the lobby of our hotel cheerfully and professionally, in good English. On the way to Ayutthaya, she was more than happy to answer our unrelated questions about Bangkok, Thailand and Ayutthaya (eg. how to say \"thank you\", what education was like, what \"Bang\" means). Using a map, she gave a rundown of the geography of Ayutthaya and showed what we would be doing for the day and where. Our first stop was Bang Pa-in, which was very peaceful and serene. No crowds at all, unlike the attractions in Bangkok. We went to a temple that looked like a Christian church, which my parents loved (them being Roman Catholic), where we were blessed by one of the monks for health and luck. We then got on a boat down the Chao Phraya river. It was a very peaceful Sunday, with the residents swimming in front of their houses and waving hello as we passed by! At Wat Phanan Choeng, there were a lot of people paying their respects to the giant sitting Buddha, so out of respect we didn't enter the chamber itself (we viewed it from the doors).Our van brought us to lunch at a great riverside restaurant with delicious authentic dishes (try the fried fish, the seafood tom yum and the chicken curry!), and we felt very relaxed and very full.The van shuttled us to each of the ruin sites, which are very well kept. It would seem the Thais treasure their culture very much, as some restoration was going on even while we were there. Miss Petch told us that once there was a big flood and lots of money was poured into keeping the ruins from crumbling. Wat Chai Wattanaram was especially beautiful among the ruins.Throughout the tour, Miss Petch gave us overviews of the various kings, how there have been four capitals, how invaders destroyed the once-grand capital. It was impressive and she communicated very well in English. She was sweet and was even willing to answer our questions about herself. She shared that she especially loved the Ayutthaya tour because it's quite peaceful, and she showed her love for the tour it in the way she talked about the sites. If you are going on this tour, ask for her!Our van was spacious and airconditioned and fully equipped with a chest full of ice and water and towels, which were incredibly important under the hot Thailand summer heat. Bring lots of sunblock, small towels, as well as an umbrella and a wide brimmed hat. Make sure your shoulders and knees are covered, both for the purpose of the temples and so that you aren't too sunburnt! Be careful with your phone as well, as it can overheat if you use it for pictures."

We arrived in Bangkok on Thursday 7th April and were met by our tour guide, Air, at 8am the following morning for a day trip round the city taking in the Royal Palace, Wat Po, flower market and more. We chose the local transport option which involved travel on the underground, tuk tuk, long tail boat and skytrain. Our group of four were looked after all the way round, after paying for the tour we never paid for anything again all day, water, transport, lunch, juice, more water as needed, everything was supplied.Air was fantastic, funny, engaging, informative. We had a fantastic day, seeing so much more than if we had gone round the city on our own and Air added that special touch.Highly recommend to anyone in Bangkok."

Email communications were quick and efficient and booked in the UK without having to pay anything up front which helped. As we were on honeymoon we chose a private tour and it's well worth the extra money. Miss Sea was our guide on both days and she was brilliant. Very polite and kind. The driver was just as helpful and welcoming.Ayutthaya trip was really good although we were out on a VERY hot day! Very informative and beautiful ruins.Kanchanaburi Highlights tour was absolutely fantastic. Despite the horrific past it was very peaceful and respectful. All stop offs were clean and well maintained. Boat trip was really nice and there was a beautiful restaurant that we stopped off for lunch. I asked Miss Sea to order the food as she could speak to the staff to see what was good and had a great lunch in beautiful surroundings.I would highly recommend BKK Tours and really like that they will not do anything to do with animal exploitation. Bonus!Thank you Michiel, Miss Sea and Mr A"

A group of us (i.e. 6 people) booked a private full day Bangkok highlights tour for \u0e3f3300 (or about $100 USDs) pp. The price was all inclusive (i.e. included everything). The tour included pickup/dropoff at Laem Chabang, lunch, tuk-tuk ride, long tail boat ride, and visits to several attractions. Needless to say it was a much better value than any comparable/similiar tour offered by the ship. The van they used was fantastic, it was a modern air conditioned van with a 3-3-3 seat arrangement. and customized interior. Everyone was extremely comfortable in the vehicle. The lunch was in a local restaurant and was excellent. Our guide whose name was \"Air\" was exceptional too. If you happen to be in Laem Chabang on a cruise ship stop and want to see Bangkok, this is a great alternative to booking a ship's excursion. I highly recommend this company for a \"full day tour of Bangkok\"."

We have done many private tours and our tour to Ayatthula with Ms. Air was exemplary.She anticipated our every need ( even tissue for the rest room). I originally contacted Michiel at BKK about another tour. He responded immediately and explained why that would not be feasible given where we were docked. In response to my questions and given the fact that we had already been to Bangkok, he suggested this tour and sent me detailed information. Booking was easy and required no deposit. He also assigned us Ms. Air early in the process - before I even had a chance to request her!I felt that BKK went over and beyond providing an excellent tour. Michiel made excellent recommendations of other activities in the area where we docked; Ms. Air actually called our driver for the next day ( a local company) to confirm our arrangements, and offered us use of her wifi which was much appreciated.I was also impressed by how conscientious the agency was. I travelled with the previousposter Zoli who described our day so well. We had told BKK that it was not necessary to provide a guide to both Bangkok and back to the ship. I knew Air was taking the other couple out the next morning in Bangkok and told her she should go back to Bangkok instead of accompanying us back to the which was hours out of her way.Instead, she stayed with us , someone else accompanied the other couples ,and BKK provided complete coverage to everyone.Air was amazing but the funny thing was that everyone we spoke to on the ship who used BKK seemed equally delighted with their experiences!"

She also made sure we had water, cool towels and treats. Lunch was also included in the cost and was fab. She was particularly careful to make sure our girls were safe and looked after. As well as the grand palace and reclining Buddha we had lunch in a hidden local Thai restaurant where Sea gave us great advice which meant we tried things we never would have. In the afternoon we went to the flower market where Sea got us to try traditional Thai foods and explained everything we saw. This is somewhere we would have never gone ourselves. Finally we went on a river and canal tour which was wonderful. Sea answered all questions and was patient and kind and even took us right back to our hotel. She showed us how to use the sky train so tomorrow we will be able explore a bit more. I couldn't recommend this tour higher."

We have been to Bangkok many times but wanted to see Ayutthaya and then stay the night in a hotel so that we could meet up with friends who live there. We joined a small group organised by a lady on Cruise Critic.We were a group of 6 who were met at the ship by Air, our guide. She was very friendly and spoke English extremely well. A very comfortable minibus awaited us and we were given plenty of cold water and face/hand wipes throughout the trip. Our driver was very safe as it was a long journey from the ship. Plenty of Rest Room stops were also given.We first went to a place where we had to get a cable car across the Chao Phraya and we visited a unique temple that is built like a church and the resident monk is always in for a chat with his visitors. We walked around and saw the monks go about their business. Then we boarded a private long tailed boat and explored the Chao Phraya river on our way to Ayutthaya. We stopped at a restaurant overlooking the river and Air ordered a wonderful lunch for us explaining exactly what we were eating..After lunch we visited the temple ruins in the UNESCO listed historical park of Ayutthaya. We visited Wat Mahathat, Wat Phra Sri Sanphet, and the most beautiful ruin in Ayutthaya at Wat Chai Wattanaram. It was very hot and Air was always making sure that we were ok and slowed down as appropriate. What was really good is that we visited ahead of the big Tour Groups so were able to comfortably walk around. Air gave us a lot of local and historical information and answered all out questions. It was an absolute pleasure to have her as a guide.Now one couple were returing to the ship and ourselves and another couple were remaining in Bangkok for one night. Fortunately we were staying at the same hotel. At the time of organising this trip we contacted Michel to see if we could be dropped off somewhere as Bankok traffic is appauling. We were dropped off at the Airport where another guide from BKK Tours met us from the minibus (unfortunately I cannot remember her name) and took the four of us by train and skytrain and tuktuk to our hotel. I must say the last part on the tuktuk, although a little hair raising was fun. She got our train tickets, paid the tuktuk drivers so we had no worries.The other couple had arranged a morning trip with Air around Bangkok. We remained by the pool as we know Bangkok. Michel had arranged for Air to pick the four of us up from the hotel after their Bangkok tour and the four of us were driven back to the ship with plenty of time to spare.I cannot praise them enough. We had no worries and a very enjoyable and well planned excursion. Air was delightful as was the other young lady who met us at the airport, Would certainly use them again and definitely recommend to others.Thank you BKK Tours for a lovely trip"

We didn't have to worry about a thing all day.........Air did all the planning, and purchased all tickets.

Since this was our first time in Thailand, and we were only there for a quick stop before heading to Chiang Mai, we wanted to invest in a proper tour to ensure we seen as much as possible in one day and we are so happy we picked BKK tours! Our tour guide, Petch, was so friendly, approachable and had such a passion for the city that we found really infectious! As a couple, we thought maybe it might be a little awkward on a private tour but Petch was so lovely, and made us feel completely at ease in her company. Petch met us at our accomodation, and we visited the Grand Palace/Wat Pho, went for lunch in a little restaurant by the river (the food was amazing!), visited the Flower Market, took a lovely relaxing boat trip along the river (beautiful!) and as it was the Chinese New Year, Petch took us to China Town and it was great seeing all the celebrations! We took various types of transport; taxi, tuk tuk, boat, all of which Petch organised for us without any hassle. The price may seem a little daunting, however includes entry to the temples, transport, lunch (which included quite a lot of food!) and Petch kept us supplied with water throughout the day. It was such a great experience, and we finished the day feeling like we had a real feel for the city. We thoroughly enjoyed our day, and would recommend this tour, and Petch, to anyone looking for a 1 day tour of the city by a passionate, knowledgeable tour guide!"

We were not disappointed.Ms Sea our guide was waiting in the hotel lobby to great us at the arranged time. Using the local tuk tuk transport she took us to the Grand Palace/ Wat Temple.Explaining the history behind the buildings etc. The tickets for entrance to the site were bought by her thus avoiding the long quese. Ms Sea guided us through the site explaining in detail what each building/monument was built for. She also bought cold water and ice cold towels for us. It was crowded but I believe that Ms Sea's knowledge helped us to see the major attractions avoiding some of the bottle necks. She then took us to the flower market, on the way buying some street food for us to experience. Then time for lunch. Ms Sea took us to a restaurant whose entrance you would have never found on your own. Suggesting food and drinks ng to suite our taste. Then to the harbour for the private long tail boat trip. This is the reason I have only marked 4 out of 5. The boat was not allowed to \"dock\" at the main jetting, so it pulled along at a side jetty. The river was choppy. We had to then climb down into the boat without steps or any other means of getting into the boat. This was an accident waiting to happen. We did manage it, but at 65 and 69 years old it was not for the faint hearted and to be honest I should have refused to board. I do not blame BKK for the conditions but as we were doing the boat trip to see the floating market and we told conditions were to rough/windy on the river to visit the market why did they take us on the river at all? This was the only down side of our day. Would I recommend BKK tours? Yes,without a doubt. Do not visit the Grand Palace without a guide. Ms Sea was delightful, informative and profesional."

The first reason why I decided to go with BKK tours is because they are one of the only tour companies in Bangkok that has made the ethical decision not to provide tours that exploit animals, like elephant camps and tiger temples. I know these types of activities might seem harmless at first glance, but if you are considering visiting such a place, please please do a little more research before going and you'll see how bad they truly are for animals (look up the Phajaan which is the way they train the elephants). So I greatly admire BKK tours for taking this stand and knew they were the kind of company I wanted to support, plus they had great reviews. Everything went very smoothly from the moment I contacted Michiel, he answered all my questions and even gave me some great tips for my stay in Bangkok. I did the Bangkok highlights tour and my tour guide was Nadia. The tour is very flexible and I was able to choose what time in the morning I wanted to start. Nadia was completely amazing and really went above and beyond. I was scared at first that a private tour would be awkward since I was by myself, but it was the complete opposite and I felt like I was just spending the day with a very good friend who's a local and knows all the good spots. I decided to take local transportation which I definitely recommend doing. We took the sky train, Tuk tuks (which were my favorite), taxis, a long-tail boat and it really made me feel like I was getting the whole experience. We hopped on and off the Tuk tuks every time there was something interesting to see. I made the mistake of eating a big breakfast before the tour which I shouldn't have done because Nadia bought me soooo much food and drinks during the tour. We ate a lot of street food which was absolutely delicious (Nadia knows all the good stuff), I had the best fried chicken I ever tasted and many deserts too. For lunch we went to a restaurant and Nadia ordered many different dishes so that we could taste everything. I feel like we did so much during the tour, we visited food markets, the flower marker (where she even bought me a flower), china town, the temples and palaces and the long-tail boat tour. It was an excellent Itinerary for my first time in Bangkok. Nadia also offered to take pictures of me all throughout the tour. I recommend you bring a change of clothes because it gets very very hot during the day and you need long pants for the temples. If you're a picky eater tell your guide so that she knows what kind of foods to order at the restaurant. If your hotel is in the city it's better because I was staying at the airport hotel and transportation got a little tricky, but it all worked out because Michiel and Nadia were so nice and went out of their way. PS - If you would like to spend time with elephants while in Thailand, I volunteered at both Elephant Nature Park and Wildlife Friends Foundation of Thailand, and they are both amazing places that really help the animals. They both offer awesome day tours where you can walk, feed and bathe the elephants but no bull hooks, no chains and no riding. You won't regret it."

Then off to the Cemetery where the fallen had been laid and seeing some of the tributes would bring any grown man to tears. We laid our Crosses and bowed our heads in rememberance of those whose life was cut short in building the railway.

Within this day we stopped for lunch which was lovely, sitting and looking out over the river. Ms Air was very knowledgable and told us so much about each aspect of the tour. The driver was very attentative and kept us refreshed with cold towels and water. What an experience day 1.Day 2 Ms Air met us and a taxi to china town, what a place to see. then tuk tuk to the Grand palace, well so much to see and wonder on the site, then to the reclining Budda, flower and vegetable market, Dinner by the river then a tour by boat to Venice of the east canals seeing monitor lizards and feed the fish, all in all a fantastic day. Ms Air talked us through each visit and we learnt that I was born on a Tuesday so the reclining Budda was mine and my wife born on a Wednesday had 2 Buddas, we learnt so much from our experience.

In fact, the night after our first day of touring with her we had a food tuk tuk tour through another company that met shortly after our day tour ended. She was so worried about us making it on time and not getting lost that she wait for us and delivered us to the spot herself. She really went above and beyond to show us what we wanted to see in a way that we saw a ton but didn't feel rushed at all. I can't recommend this tour group highly enough."

Along with two friends en route to Myanmar for a 10-day photo tour, I spent a day with M from BKK Tours getting to see some wonderful parts of Bangkok I wouldn't have explored on my own. We visited four or five different locations (the Flower Market, Chinatown) that are apparently well known as well as smaller areas where we saw only locals and sampled delicious street food. Our choice of an air-conditioned minivan gave us some breaks from the heat in between stops and we were offered cool bottled water and cleaning wipes every time we got back in the van. M speaks English beautifully and kept us informed and entertained throughout the day. We appreciated his choice of places to visit and his help in getting some great shots. Can't recommend him, and this tour, highly enough."

I'd never been before. I was met at the hotel by Ms Oi who was lovely, friendly and really knowledgable. Being a one to one tour meant we could have really good conversations about everything we saw and as a result I learned so much. We saw all the usual attractions but the tour of the local markets and streets was the most interesting and memorable and the boat trip round the canals was exciting and fascinating. We shared a really good lunch which was included in the price as were all the fares, entry charges, bottles of water etc. I only spent a day in Bangkok but came away knowing and understanding much more than I would have done in a week on my own. The price was incredible considering what I got for it. Thanks so much! If I come back I will definitely do other tours you offer! I hope so!"

The tour guide Petch was great and she did much to make sure we were comfortable. Set of at 7am and back at hotel around 5pm. For those of you who are new in Bangkok, the floating markets are a must. Chinatown was busting with people and I think that's because the Chinese New Year is approaching too. Beware of pickpockets. Had a great lunch at a quaint restaurant by the MaeKlong river. Great Thai food. This is not the Mekong, the Mekong is by the Thailand border. Thailand is just beautiful, in its own way. I would recommend BKK Tour to anyone who wants to sightsee. You don't get to be huddled into a big bus with many other tourists and you can take your time to enjoy the sceneries. After all its a private tour."

After reading many positive reviews of BKK Tours here on TA, I contacted them to book Bangkok Highlights & Authentic Ayutthaya. Michel answered all of my emails (and there were a lot of them!) promptly and courteously. He helped me choose a hotel from several that I found that looked appealing. I also asked him for some advice on restaurants I had come across. He was happy to assist, even having his wife Air make a reservation for us. This extra help was so very appreciated!The day of our tour, Nadia was waiting for us at the cruise terminal, and we were then on our way to Bangkok. Nadia's English was excellent! She spent most of the drive getting to know us and answering questions about her life and Thai culture. We visited the flower market (where we received flower corsages), then took tuk-tuks to lunch, then headed to the Grand Palace & reclining Buddha, followed by a long tail boat ride. During the day, Nadia was always helpful and kind, making sure we had enough food & drinks, providing us with cold towels, and giving us lots of information about what we were seeing. At the end of the day, she pulled me aside to double check if we still wanted to go to Ayutthaya the next day, as the very hot weather was clearly affecting most of our group. We definitely did still want to go, but it was so thoughtful of her to check!Nadia then accompanied us on the SkyTrain to our hotel (Eastin Grand Sathorn). She also recommended a place for my husband & me to get massages and made us a reservation. Finally, she talked to us about proper bargaining if we chose to visit any of the markets that night - both were extra touches that we really appreciated.Day 2, we visited a monastery and met a monk, then took another long tail boat to Ayutthaya to see various sites of the ruins. We were all very impressed with Nadia's knowledge of what we were seeing, and she again took great care of us by making sure we had water/ towels and stopping to get us ice cream.I can't imagine a better tour operator in Bangkok. It is clear that Michel, Air, & Nadia (and I'm sure all the other guides) love what they do. They are knowledgeable, friendly, and really go above and beyond what would be included in an average guided tour. I am so glad we chose BKK and would recommend them to anyone! - Susan & Milton, November 2015"

She is very knowledgeable of the sites we were visiting and spoke English well. Every detail was taken care of including hotel pickup/drop off, site transportation, food and entrance fees. Ms. Oi even bought us water and cooling towels several times throughout the day to help with the heat. To put the icing on the cake she even helped us barter our first purchase of a souvenir at the grand palace. After our tour ended she sat down with us and a map of the metro/sky train system, she then went over in detail how to get to the most popular destinations. I understand that BKK tours might not be the cheapest tour available but I must say that based on my experience they were worth every single penny. I would recommend them to anyone who is interested in seeing many attractions in one day."

Michiel handled all my enquiries promptly and advised on the best tours to suit our interests, timing and family. We therefore booked and thoroughly enjoyed the following tours, with Miss Oi, our guide who was patient, kind, full of interesting facts and great fun!Bangkok half day tour 1pm-4pm. Miss Oi collected us from our hotel on the river in Bangkok and travelled with us by taxi to the flower market where we explored the wonderful creations being made. We then walked through the local fruit and veg markets until we arrived at a pier for a local canal trip by longtail boat - and it was lovely to see the backwaters of Bangkok away from the main transport routes. On our way we saw three asian water monitors, turtles, large catfish, lots of local houses on the water and had our first introduction to the colourful spirit houses.Half day Tha Kha floating market visit - 7h30-1pm. We were advised to visit this rather then the central or other Bangkok floating markets which are very touristy. We were pleased we did. Held only on certain days, we managed to fit this into our limited stay in Bangkok. Arriving in the early morning, we felt honoured to be part of the local tradition of ladies coming along on their wooden boats to 'barter' and do their shopping for local food stuff and produce. No hustle and bustle, not another tourist in sight and just the quiet tranquillity of the canal and laughter of the ladies. We left the market by boat ourselves to explore the neighbouring canals, visiting a nearby palm sugar farm, and just enjoying the wonder of nature we were able to see - monitors, birds, gorgeous flowers, palm trees etc. Following on from Tha Kha, we stopped at the Daemon Saduak floating market.The contrast in this floating market was hard to believe. So busy, touristy, and with a completely different kind of atmosphere and goods being sold. Sad really we felt, and so noisy too - with boats using horrid motors, which weren't used at all and only oars were used to quietly row the boats at Tha Kha. At this market, it was the only time I felt aggressive sales to try and get us to buy something, which was unfortunate. Still interesting to see, but we were all very pleased that this was not our only impression of a floating market - and glad we saw them in the traditional format earlier in the day. We also stopped into the train market, which unfortunately did not have the train running due to repairs - but very interesting to see the tiny space that these market sellers set up in between buildings, with the prospect of having to quickly move their goods when a train would be passing through.Our final tour with BKK, Miss Oi and our driver, was to the historic park of Ayutthaya. This was a full day tour, starting at 8am and returning after 4pm from our hotel in Bangkok. We set off with the usual cheeriness, promptness and all in good form. Our first arrival about 1 1/2 hours later was to the monastery on an island only accessible by cable car. This was quite 'European' in feel and architecture, but quietly serene with Monks going about their business and a haven for a lucky few dogs. From here we went by traditional long tail boat all along the river to a wonderful temple. The temple gave us a good indication of traditional painting on the wooden interior walls - a time consuming job taking years to complete and we saw the artists in action. The temple also included a large gold Buddha being 'dressed' in a ceremony, as well as other artefacts and stories to hear and learn from as we walked about exploring our surroundings. We went onto the ancient 'ruins' as such of the city, visiting two separate sites which were quite spectacular and once again we felt lucky to be walking where so much history, ending with the sacking of the palaces and temples occurred. Many had advised us on our visit to Bangkok, and I'm pleased we decided to leave our tours in the hands of BKK. They were extremely professional from the first enquiry to the very end. Friendly, helpful and so very efficient - we would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone travelling to Bangkok and surrounds! Thank you to Michiel and Oi for making our visit so memorable."

Right from the first point of contact, Michael was prompt and clear in all the responses. We took two tours with them - Bangkok city private tour and one to Ayuthaya. Both were with the charming, knowledgeable and hugely entertaining Ms. Sea. We could have simply left our purses at home ! Ms. Sea met us at our apartment lobby, and took us thru all of Bangkok using public transport. I would highly recommend this method - unless you have very little children or senior citizens in your midst. The lotus folding at the flower market, visit to the spice market ( where I loaded myself with tons of lovely lemongrass, and various local dried and preserved herbs and spices), visits to the Grand Palace and the temples were all very well conducted, and Sea answered all our myriad questions about Thai culture, everyday life, religion, etc. Never was she at a loss for words ! We ae strictly vegetarian, and Sea managed to give a lovely Thai lunch experience after talking to the chefs at the Navy Club where she treated us to lunch. It was delicious and we enjoyed it a lot. She also took so many photos of us together - something we normally never get on our various trips ! Ayuthaya was too good for words. The heritage site, combined with the narration by Sea, plus the visit to the street food market where she gave us samples of various wonderful Thai desserts was awesome. All along, we were offered ice cold water, cold towels, stopped for tea and snacks, and I could also stop at one of the roadside shops to buy some garden ornaments. Once again, we had la delicious vegetarian lunch at a place she took us to. There were NO hidden costs, no nasty surprises. I think this is a very well run company, and Sea became a friend at the end of Day 1 itself !"

Over many emails and my MANY questions, Michiel was patient and continued to help me plan what ended up being a fabulous day for everyone.One important note: when I inquired about going to see elephants as part of our tour, Michiel let me know that they only go to ethical sanctuaries. While there were other elephant ride places to go, he did not recommend them. I was so glad for that advice and happy that there is a tour company that holds the well being of the animals above profits.We were picked up at our hotel by 5 lovely tour guides who were all smiles. Our group was split up into 5 luxury vans stocked with cold water and chilled towels to wipe our faces with during the day as it was very hot and humid. Those towels were heaven on earth! Our group was led by Air who was so sweet, funny and knowledgeable. Her English skills were very good as well. Our tour went to the Railway Market, Damnoen Saduak Floating Market, a stop for delicious and plentiful Thai lunch, Wat Pho and finally a canal tour in Bangkok. Air expertly led us through these locations, informing us with interesting facts along the way and feeding us Thai fruits and snacks. All 4 locations gave our group the perfect overview and introduction to Thai life as we saw both rural and urban life in both authentic and touristy ways.Every single person who went on this tour raved about it.

Though we were on a short Bangkok highlights tour, we were treated with great professionalism and all our needs were taken care of. Our guide Ms. Air is a very nice lady and full of knowledge, and left none of our questions unanswered. We became very good friends and our 10 months old daughter was too fond of her. BKK tours are very professional with a blend of friendliness in their conduct. Those travelling with young children or special conditions can opt their mini van otherwise I shall suggest to travel by Bangkok's local modes of transportation."

We found this tour group on tripadvisor and it turned out to be the best decision we made on our 15 day cruise when it came to tours. Michael advised us from the beginning on the details of the tour and suggested 3 couples so each would have their own row in the van. Totally comfortable and super roomy by following his advice. Ms. Air was our guide and a true pro. One of the couples on our tour failed to inform us prior to joining the group they had special needs. She didn't miss a beat, so I just hope they tipped her well.The tour was varied between walking, boating & the van. The lunch they arranged was a 10+, large assortment of food, on the water and was included in the price of the tour. It was also a full day tour, not cut short like tours we arranged in other ports.So if you are going to Bangkok or are there for a couple of days, check them out. If you are on a cruise ship, book early (I did over 3 months prior) as they usually sell out when the ships are in port."

I have been to Bangkok a few times before and have done all the usual things - and as a photographer and traveller I was looking for something unique. Over the 7 hours we visited a slum area, Mr Michai was very knowledgable and it was great to get an upstanding of what has put these people here and who they are (and it's not what you think...!!!). We also rode the water taxi with locals heading off to work, which was brilliant, walked through a Temple complex you would not know existed, stopped for local coffee, took a 40 foot long boat (private) out around an area that was more like a Cambodian fishing village, then finally a walk through the backstreets of Chinatown to visit another temple.....All within the inner city and by foot....!!! : )A reasonable amount of fitness is required, certainly not stroller friendly....will definitely be in touch when I return to Bangkok next year.....!!!!"

Contacting BKK Tour was the best thing I did for our trip to Bangkok! We thoroughly enjoyed our three day travel with BKK. I will separate my reviews into two parts: Pre-planning phase and touring phase.Pre-travel/planning Phase: Michiel was my best source in providing recommendation for our three day itinerary. He was prompt and thorough when comes to responding to my emails. I simply advised him my travel dates to Bangkok , he provided me with several recommendations for our time there. He is careful and thoughtful in suggesting our itinerary. I was even able to get his opinions on hotels and locations. Even after I settled on an itinerary, Michiel continued to keep in touch until our travel date. Michiel definitely made my travel planning easier and effortless. Thank you Michiel!Touring phase: The three-day itinerary was well organized and fantastic. We had the pleasure of having Ms. Oi as our guide. She was always on time, cheerful, accommodating and professional. And in addition to visiting the sites, Ms. Oi introduced several awesome local foods to us! (And all of them were soooo yummy!) I only wish I had a bigger appetite to try more! While in Bangkok, instead of taking tour buses like other tour companies, Ms. Oi took us to ride the local taxi (tuk tuk) though the crazy streets of Bangkok, and to ride a boat down a canal to see local their living. We had Peter as our driver for two days (one day to the floating markets and one day to the Auytthaya). His car is extremely clean and comfortable. It was 95 degree and muggy during our time there and at every stop Peter provided us with a cold bottled water and a cold towels. It was a very special touch to the BBK tour!I do not have any negative feedback on BKK Tour. BKK Tour made our trip to Bangkok easy and fun! Thank you Mr. Michiel and Ms. Oi! We will definitely contact you again for our next trip to Bangkok (soon)!"

This company offers stellar communication services, thank you Michiel. Air arrived promptly to collect us at our hotel and off we went via local transport to view many highlights of this bustling city. We really felt we had a glimpse into local life as well as seeing the important temples. The ride on the canal and river by longboat was enlightening to view locals homes. We added on the Jim Thompson house and that was an appreciated end to our day.So nice to pay one price and have all the days transport and entrance fees included. Many special touches also included- gold leaf to rub on Budda, bread to feed the fish,and coins to support the ongoing renovations at one temple.As well, a tasty lunch and plenty of cold water to drink on a hot day. Thank you Air for your enthusiasm and pleasant, considerate personality. We truly were well looked after!We wish you and Michiel all the best in this business venture. We have no doubt you will succeed, you strive to be the best and you ARE!!"

We arrived in Bangkok late afternoon, and that evening I managed to book the Bangkok Highlights tour via email with Michiel. Very accommodating and efficient booking service which we very much appreciated. We paid a deposit via PayPal that night to secure our tour, and paid the balance to our guide (Ms. Sea) the next morning, and she immediately sent our receipt through to our email.Ms. Sea was at our lobby to meet us before our meeting time of 8:30am. Which was clear from the start that she was organised. And indeed she was!Ms. Sea provided us with a fun, educational and memorable day. I had mentioned to Ms. Sea that we had gone for a walk around our neighbourhood the night before and also caught the sky train, which we managed to do without any issues. So we didn't catch the train during the tour, so took taxi & tuk-tuks. From the markets, sites, yummy lunch, canal ride...it was very educating and fun. As we were a couple, Ms. Sea tried her best to steer us from larger crowds so she didn't have to raise her voice and so we could hear her...and get unobstructed photos. We highly recommend Ms. Sea and BKK Tours for anyone looking to have a guide show you around this awesome city/country with local insights and to ensure we all follow protocol when visiting sacred places."

Bangkok can be intimidating. She fit soooo much into our day. Temples, Palace, canal rides, delicious Thai lunch, intro to Thai customs and way of life,etc....it was a real treat to have her as our own personal guide.

Our guide Miss Oi was a delight: friendly, knowledgeable and she ensured that we had a wonderful morning trying different treats and learning about the exotic produce. The contrasts between the markets made it all the more interesting - Thaka is more like a meeting of old friends and locals who are almost as interested in catching up as they were in selling their wares. A boat ride from Thaka took us through peaceful canals to a home where palm sugar is made the old fashioned way. Maeklong is also fascinating - lots of seafood, meats and other foods crammed into a narrow tract they share with a regular train (which is currently suspended while other developments are done on the line). When the train is operating, traders and customers have three minutes warning to pull back their goods and themselves from the line before the train trundles through.

We thought that we would do a tour as our time was brief and we wanted to get a good insight into the city with the time we had. I booked BKK over the internet by email. We were met at the cruise terminal in Laemchabang by Ms Nadia and then driven in a comfortable bus into Bangkok. Prior to arriving all communication with BKK was good, they promptly answered emails, sent a pdf catalogue of their different tours and answered any questions or concerns. On arrival Ms Nadia welcomed us and on the trip to Bangkok, and throughout the two day tour, we were given plenty of cold bottled water and cool refresher towels.The bus was comfortable with tinted windows, leather seats and air-conditioning and plenty of leg room.Ms Nadia was a wonderful guide. You may have heard that the Thai people are gentle and extremely hospitable. Ms Nadia embodied these qualities and she has a great local knowledge and was always willing to share knowledge and information about her city, country and culture. If we had tried to explore Bangkok on our own there is no way we would have seen as much or have gained such insight. The tour was inclusive of lunch and admissions and some other activities (orchid folding at the flower market) as well as some snacks and drinks. We visited the colourful flower and vegetable market, had lunch at the Navy Club restaurant, went to the Grand Palace and the Emerald Buddha and later to the Reclining Buddha. We had a tuk tuk ride through the busy streets and later a tail boat ride along the canals of Bangkok, at one point we stopped to feed some of the many fish that live in the canals. The extensive rivers and canals make one see why Bangkok is sometimes called the Venice of the Orient. The tail boat took us directly to our hotel, the Royal Orchid Sheraton that has it's own pier right on the river. It was a great way to arrive and check into the hotel at the end of a long and busy day. Ms Nadia arrived at the hotel early next morning for the second day of our tour and took us to the amazing Tha Kha Floating Markets a little outside of Bangkok. These are the more authentic floating markets and as such there is a noticeable lack of tourists. I noted only one other small group. The markets were beautiful, women in their boats trading and cooking for market visitors as they have done so for decades. I was able to talk to one of these older ladies with the help of Ms Nadia as translator. We then went on a boat trip through the narrow canals around the plantations and homes in the area. After this we then went to Bangkok to a more touristy and larger floating market. The comparison between the two was interesting. I enjoyed both markets but I think that Tha Kha was my favourite. Ms Nadia took us to a noodle vendor in the markets. This lady prepares the most amazing delicious noodles in her boat, she has been selling bowls of noodles at the markets since she was 13 years old and she is now in her 70s and has become a bit of an institution. Doing this tour through BKK with Ms Nadia and our professional driver was like visiting family in Bangkok and having them show you around. It was great and I would not only highly recommend BKK tours but I plan on doing another tour with them on my next visit to Bangkok."

You can go to all these places by yourself if you stay a couple of days. It is an expensive tour but it is hassle free. The floating marketWe had a last day in Bangkok before leaving Thailand and I really wanted to visit the floating markets. I had agreed on an itinerary with Michiel ( the man behind the emails) prior to the trip.+Again, communication was smooth, pick up on time and all the areas were covered. These markets are out of Bangkok ( about an hour driving) and not easy to locate so it is nice to go with a driver.+/-I was sent with a slightly less experienced guide ( this was agreed before). The floating markets were the reason why I booked the trip, I did not really care for the temple or the cave. The first market I visited was very local, less touristy and we enjoyed seeing a coco plantation but I did not feel the buzz or excitement or the floating market there were around 7 boats in total. When we went to the other market that is when I felt the emotion. Unfortunately a tour on a boat had not been agreed and I really had to push and insist to go on a boat there. After asking 2 times, on the 3rd occasion I said firmly to the guide who was keeping on ignoring my request ' we want to go on the boat'. At that time we had a lot of time in front of us. After calling her boss she agreed for an extra charge for the boat which was not an issue for us. The restaurant on that day ( the cabbage and condom) offered good food but was a bit on the old side. My biggest deception was with the ' folk museum/temple' that was scheduled for the afternoon. I really did not get the point of seeing this. The guide could not explain the history behind and it was like seeing an old house with antique furniture in the basement. There was no shadow light show so we were done in 10 minutes. That was it for the day. We drove back to the airport and were there 1 hour before the scheduled end of the tour. On this tour I felt it was not worth the money spent. My recommendation for this tour :if like me you are interested in the floating market then make it clear that you want to spend time there and scrap the folk museum. There is no point in rushing there if you enjoy it. I flew 12 hours to see that and it was done in 30 minutes. Make it clear when you book, The guide has seen it a hundred times but for you it will be unique. Also, there is no real need of a guide here. The tour can be done with a driver only. Even if our guide ( Ms Sea was really friendly and did her best to help)"

Researching led me to this great company and the experience was stellar! Emailing and booking with Michiel was a breeze. Completely customer oriented I was assisted in choosing the Bangkok Highlights day tour. This was a long private tour but felt like it flew by. The morning of our tour we were greeted at our hotel by Ms. Oi whose warm personality immediately let us know that we had made the right choice and Michiel had booked us a terrific guide. We traveled first to the Wat Pho temple where Ms Oi assisted us in entering the temple as the Thai do. We got our fortune and made offerings to our birth Buddhas before moving into the great reclining Buddha. Ms. Oi offered so much information throughout our tour and made sure we saw things that others might miss like a couple working on a restoration area of the temple on a large Buddha. We finished this tour by walking past an area where a monk was taking offerings from Thai Buddhists in the form of young monk care packages with robes and other essentials. I asked Ms. Oi if it was proper for us to do this and she said less and led us through the ceremony. We made the offering as instructed in the names of our departed loved ones and my son choose his departed grandparents. As we made our offering the young monk blessing us nodded and smiled slightly to encourage us that we were doing it correctly. This memory will live with us forever and Ms.Oi's generous and welcoming assistance made it happen. We went on to visit the Royal Palace and flower and food markets. Ms. Oi had us try a delicious fruit and bought some to send us back to the hotel with. She cared for our thirst and heat by buying us water and an ice towel at the temple. We enjoyed a lovely lunch where her recommendations were spot on and delicious. Our last stop was a long boat ride through the Bangkok canals where we saw many sites and few catfish at a temple. We took tuk tuks, taxis, metro, and long boat on this tour and learned so much about Bangkok and its citizens along the way. When we said goodbye to Ms. Oi at our hotel we were both sorry to see her go and wished we had time for another tour outside the city with her."

We were picked up in a spacious and comfortable van and the tour guide was very informative and friendly. The waterfall swimming experience was fun and the fish nibbled on your feet. Lunch at a restaurant was included and there was lots to eat. The elephant sanctuary was very memorable. We learned a lot about the animals and prepared food for them. We were able to hand feed these amazing animals. We swam with them in the river Kwai and were able to climb up onto them while we swam. One of our group members lost his glasses in the river and they were miraculously found the following day as the river level had dropped. The tour company owner communicated with our group and made arrangements to meet with us at the airport to drop off the glasses. I will definitely do another tour with this company!"

Luckily for us traffic was not a problem on that day, usually they do not recommend taking a car around as bangkok is known for it's crazy traffic. Emma took us around to see the beautiful flower and veg market,the temple of the reclining buddha, the grande palace, the temple of the emerald buddha and a lovely tail boat ride through the canals of bangkok. Refreshments were provided all day and we also had an amazing thai lunch by the riverside.We stuck to schedule and finished our tour at 4.30pm as indicated.If you are looking for a bangkok highlights tour I really do recommend BKK tours as they are very organised andEmma was so lovely to have as a guide.

I had booked a 4 day programme that included an overnight stay in Ayutthaya and then 2 day tours from my Bangkok hotel. The overnight stay in Ayutthaya was particularly memorable with a night time tour of floodlit temple ruins free from the usual hordes of tourists. In Bangkok the visit to the Royal Barges Museum, canal tour by long tail boat and local temple visit were very interesting. That evening we had dinner at Eat Sight Story with wonderful views of Wat Arun. Afterwards we visited Wat Po for a nighttime tour of the floodlit temple. On the final day we travelled outside Bangkok to visit the small but interesting Erawan Museum and then the Amphawa floating market including a long tail boat tour. As before the level of service offered by Air and her driver was excellent, from the airport pickup to the end of final tour. Overall I highly recommend BKK Tours."

They also proved to be very honest as my husband could not go on a boat tour because of an ankle problem and Ms Oi took the cost of the boat out of the total (not so evident as per separate review of another tour). One more thing that I really liked is that during the tours we often met other BKK tours guide and they were all very nice kind.

She assisted me with translating so I could secure enough charge to take pictures of the train and floating markets. Day 2: Partied too hard the previous night and was about a half hour late coming downstairs. She waited patiently. The restaurant by the long tail boat dock was AMAZING!!! OMG. She ordered for us and I was so happy.

We've had tours with BKK Tours on two previous occasions - we can't fault their prompt communication, easy customisation of tours, personal attention and outstanding knowledge of this wonderful city. We even keep in touch with Michiel and Air via Facebook. This year they were travelling abroad so Nadia was our guide. Happily for us we now have a new friend in Bangkok! I'd arrived in Bangkok but my suitcase had not. Within minutes of meeting Nadia on the morning of our tour and once she learned of my missing suitcase she was on the phone to my airline acting as go-between. This was really unexpected but shows what an exceptionally genuine and kind person she is. Sensing that I was a bit stressed, Nadia asked us if we would like to go an adventure to some of her favorite places before we commenced the main part of our tour. Of course we said yes, and I won't give anything away (you have to go on the tour for that!) but we were taken to some of Chinatown's hidden gems and secret laneways. Amazing photo opportunities at every turn. We continued on to the Grand Palace and despite the rain it was an incredible day as Nadia taught us so much - her knowledge is amazing. She was always whipping out umbrellas just before the rain came, knew how to avoid the crowds, the best angles for photos. She was always looking out for us, she even offered to buy my husband a rain poncho. After our tour she kept in touch with us daily on Facebook while she continued to make inquiries with the airline. This was such a blessing as we didn't have international roaming on our phones, so when my suitcase was found the airline was able to notify Nadia. I really don't know what we would have done without her. We owe her our deep gratitude for her tenacity and determination.We regard this tour company so highly we are already booked to go to Kanchanaburi in 2016."

E-mail correspondence planning the trip was prompt and questions answered thoroughly. Michiel matched our interests with tour suggestions. After reading many recommendations for a guide named Miss Air, we specifically asked for her. Many tour operators promise a particular guide but then make a switch without notifying the guests. As BKK Tours promised, Miss Air was holding the name of our group as we exited our cruise ship.We were led to a very comfortable AC van and introduced to our driver Est. During our two days of touring, he was very attentive, greeted us with cold, wet washcloths, bottles of water, and was always willing to provide assistance getting into and out of the van.Miss Air was what previous reviewers had written. She shared much interesting information, knew when to take us places for best advantage, had a beautiful smile and a sweet personality, very attentive, extremely organized, offered frequent restroom breaks and even went into the facilities to check for cleanliness. Throughout our tour she also provided small courtesies to enhance our enjoyment: opportunity to place gold leaf on a Buddha figure, to throw coins in 108 bronze bowls at Wat Pho to feed the catfish in the canal, and to enjoy take-out sticky rice and mango on the long drive back to our cruise ship.Bangkok Metropolis has a population of over eight million and is one of the world\u2019s top tourist destinations so planning a quick two-day tour for first-time visitors was daunting. Between places we wanted to see and experiences suggested by BKK Tours, we returned to our cruise ship with fantastic memories to last a lifetime. Our sightseeing time was maximized and our enjoyment was truly multiplied. One suggestion: book a tour with this tour company early. There are many good Bangkok tour operators but this one is outstanding."

There were 4 of us and we did the Full day Bangkok tour and the Bridge over the river Kwai tour.Full day bangkok tour - This is great if you want to see everything and go by various means of local transport. Because you have a guide you don't need to worry about haggling prices for taxis or tuk tuks. The Long boat ride up the river was great! The tour is private too which just makes it more special. The flower market is great and the temples are amazing. Air has so much knowledge and she has the balance right with letting you explore and gathering you back to tell you information. The River Kwai tour is wonderful, if you are a history lover this is great! It is an emotional tour and very thought provoking. It is a whole day tour. Cool towels and water are provided throughout the day which is very welcome in the bangkok heat! Again Air is a wonderful guide and were so lucky to have her for both days of our tours.We were met at our hotel and picked up by a luxurious mini van. Our driver was also great.Book BKK tours you won't regret it!"

This is one of the best tours I've been on.They came and picked us up from our hotel in a really comfortable mini bus with cold water waiting for us.The tour guide was first class.She spoke very good English and I felt very at ease talking to her.The drive out of Bangkok to our 1st stop was just over an hour but in that time our guide was answering questions and telling us all about Thailand so the time flew.The 1st stop was to the railway market.It felt so authentic to been walking down the railway track with people on each side selling almost anything.Our guide bought some fruit for us to try which was delicious.We were taken to the other side of the market to wait for the train to pass through.It was amazing to watch the sellers at the market prepare for the train to pass through as the warning alarm went off.We then got back to the bus to continue the tour,whee fresh cold water was waiting and a cold towel to help cool down.We then went to the floating markets which I really enjoyed.We were in the boat for about half an hour and there's people on either side and in boats going past you,selling lots of different things.This was a half day tour and cost us about \u00a360 each,which seems expensive but I thought it was well worth it to see something outside of Bangkok that you wouldn't do independently.It was a fantastic day and I really would highly recommend it."

We saw they were #1 rated on TripAdvisor and now we know why. Michiel was very responsive to email and designed a tour that fit our interests exactly. We asked to begin our tour midday after we arrived so we could rest, and BKK worked around our schedule completely. Our tour guide, Ms. Oi, was friendly, knowledgeable, and always made extra effort to make sure we were comfortable. I was impressed by her detailed historical and cultural knowledge of each site we visited. She struck a perfect balance between letting us explore on our own while giving us all the facts and details we wanted. We were so glad to be on our own and not part of the big crowd. BKK arranged for everything: clean and comfortable transportation, bottled water, and delicious authentic meals. I felt like we experienced things most tours cannot offer. You can't go wrong choosing BKK."

We were planning to be in Bangkok at the beginning of our Honeymoon only for a couple days because thats where the main flight came in, however we decided to stay extra days and explore the city! Man am I glad we did that, it ended up being our favorite stop in entire Thailand! (and my wife originally didnt even want to stay at all because she everyone always thinks of \"beaches\" associated with Thailand but man LOVED it too!). I decided to book BKK tours due to the incredible reviews they have on here and I am soooo glad I booked 2 tours with them! Michiel is Fantastic and was soooo helpful emailing back and forth and customizing the tours we wanted with the days we had available, he also went far and beyond with other suggestions for us for restaurants and etc always extremely fast at responding.We did the Bankok Highlights tours with the Mrs Air and the markets tour with Mrs. Oi and I cant even describe in words how awesome they both were yet so different! Always so sweet, helpful, available for any questions, sooooo knowledgable! By the end of the day I didnt consider them just tour guides but family/friends. I literally would describe Mrs Air as my big sister (always teasing me! ahah) and Mrs Oi as my little sister ahah We had so much fun together and I loved all the personal touches they give and how they adjust the tours depending on weather, how tired we are, and outside things that may happen. Mrs Oi even took us to a coconut plantation that was not part of tour and we got to experience a real traditional Thai meal.. we LOVED that! And Mrs Air was so fabolous explaining us all the history of the temples and took us on a real tour of Bangkok using local transportation and going tru all the markets, explaining us traditions and making us do them.... man we loved these tours and never wanted them to end!!!! Thank you again to all of you...you guys are awesome, keep it up! And for anyone reading this, look NO FURTHER... i took a lot of tours around the world and they are by far the best company I have ever dealt with ALL around.PS your luxury van was sooo cool and awesome, always giving us a cold water and chilled towels everytime we got back in the van... what a touch of class!!!"

I extended the Authentic Markets trip with Wat Pho and Wat Arun. I also arranged a one-way airport transfer with them. BKK refunded the admission fees for Wat Arun as the temple is currently under renovations and the entire temple is covered by scaffolding, hence not worth a visit. Michiel replied my emails promptly and offered some discounts for the trips. Really appreciate that! Their luxury van was comfortable and spacious for the 7 of us. Cold water and chilled towels were given a few times throughout the trip. Our guide Ms Oi was friendly & cheerful. She's around our age and happened to be Ethnic Chinese as well, so we have some other common topics. We had delicious authentic Thai food by the riverside for lunch. Instead of pre-ordering the food, we were free to choose what we would like to eat. Ms Oi made some good recommendations and I got to try some food for the first time (mee krob, chicken larb). BKK is very flexible with last minute requests, like changing the drop-off location after the trip. Thanks Michiel & Ms Oi!"

            "review": "Great Personal Tour Guide Service in Bangkok. On a recent trip to Thailand I had three free days in Bangkok before joining up with a group for some scuba diving in Phuket. Based on several tripadvisor reviews I contacted Michiel at BKK tours to arrange for some photography/sightseeing tours. Through our e-mail correspondence we came up with an itinerary for the three days that would give me a great overview of the many sights in the Bangkok area, teach me about the city, its history and its culture, and allow me to visit some terrific temples, markets, ruins and local neighborhoods filled with photogenic places and people.The first day, Michiel and Ms Nez met me early in the morning with an air conditioned van and driver and we set off to visit several markets and temples in the greater Bangkok area. We visited the Tha Kha floating market, the railway market , a palm sugar plantation, the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew temple. Michiel's insights as to how to get the most unique photographs of the people and the sites were excellent. Between every stop our driver met us with the van with air conditioning on, cold towels and bottled water at the ready. The whole day tour included many local snacks, lunch at an excellent local restaurant and all entrance fees.The second day,Ms Nez and I, with our van and driver, headed out to Ayutthaya to visit the modern temples and ancient ruins. We traveled between some sights by private long-tailed boat.The guide's knowledge of local history, customs, the temples and their religion helped put everything in perspective. She served as translator while I sat and visited with the senior Monk at the new temple, an experience I could not have imagined otherwise. Again, lunch and all fees were included.The third day, at my request, my guide, M, showed me around town using local transportation, the local boat services, the skytrain, cabs and tuk-tuks. We visited Chinatown (one of the biggest in the world) and several other neighborhoods. We kept up a running conversation on Thai history, culture, politics and religion. Again photography was easy as M broke the ice with local people and pointed out the best locations for unique shots.All in all this was a great experience and I can't imagine that it could have been better. The fee for the three days was less than I have paid for single day private tours elsewhere and the service throughout was first class. Michiel is a Dutch national married to a Thai woman and they run the tour service together with the help of several local guides. If you want to experience all that Bangkok has to offer in a short visit this is the way to go."

I have 3 seniors in their 80's and they have taken so good care of the seniors to ensure that they are comfortable and adjust the space of the tours if need be. Due to the way that they have taken care of the seniors, all the seniors were very very happy with the tours. Really they (guide & driver) took great length to ensure that the seniors are well taken of during the tours and also of course us too. The drivers did a good job on the driving too.Overall BKK Tour company does provide excellent tours and very well run. Highly recommended.Tourist from CANADA."

Our guide as called Chao, as was our driver, They both worked together to give us the best experience possible. Nothing was too much trouble. The level of knowledge and expertise that Chao was able to provide helped us to learn about Thailand, as well as providing a wealth of information about Kanchanaburi. We visited Hellfire pass, a very moving experience. The museum was incredible, a museum with almost no exhibits, due to the fact that the prisoners of war had nothing, and left nothing such was the abuse and neglect that they suffered. The pictures, film and illustrations told you all you needed to know. We then had lunch at a resort on the River Kwai, crossed the famous bridge and visited the Jeath museum, which was a reconstruction of a POW hut. BKK provided unlimited coffee, drinks, lunch, fruit, anything we wanted all at no extra cost. They are not the cheapest, but you definitely get your moneys worth. Don't have any doubts if you want a tour which gives you what you want BKK will do this."

Her English was very understandable, not very easy to find in all local tour operators.The lunch was included, in a traditional Thai restaurant.The tour was out of the touristic crowded path, so perfect to us, since we got to know the traditional feeling of some important parts of the history of Thailand. We saw a Buddhist ceremony with local people which was nice. Ayuthaya ruins are a sad but important part of the history of Thailand. Overall it was a nice and reliable day with BKK yours. You can trust them.I advise you try to contact them in advance to arrange your tour because they can get fully booked easily. I was not able to book the Bangkok tour on because they were fully booked 2 months in advance for the day after ayuthaya.Hope you find this review helpful."

Along the way she purchased food and drinks (included in the tour price) from various stands for us to try. She explained what the flowers were used for and showed us how to fold the petals of a lotus flower. Next we went to Wat Po and the Royal Palace. All very interesting. We stopped for a very good lunch at a place on the river that I believe was called \"The Navy Wives Club\" or something like that. Also included in the tour. The food was great, but because we had eaten a big breakfast we couldn't eat much of it. Then we rode a long tail boat through the canals for an hour or so. When we got back to our hotel, Nadia asked us what we had planned for the next four days. When I told her that we hadn't decided, she drew out a four day itinerary of things that we should do.

Through out the day Nadia would explain the historical significance of everyplace we were seeing through wonderful stories. She also helped us learn a few Thai phases that were great throughout our travels! Nadia always made sure we were well hydrated by buying waters nonstop for us! She also had chilled towels for us two or three times to help us cool off... I thought that was awesome!!! I have never had a guide that was so friendly, knowledgable, and well prepared. She pulled out sunscreen for me when she noticed that I was starting to get red. That is customer service! She really showed us an amazing view of Bangkok from the Rich to the middle class....

Ms. Oi handled us all expertly, keeping the right pace and making it all work. We did Meet the Locals and loved the river boat and canal tours. We also did the Local Markets and highly recommend the Floating Market- do the pad thai there for breakfast! Leading up to our trip, manager Michiel was almost too accommodating with my repeated inquiries, which he handled expertly, promptly and professionally. BKK is a class operation and you should trust them and use them."

He was waiting for us in the lobby of our hotel and after walking us through the plan for the day we went out to our nice, air conditioned van with driver. We did the train market, floating market and reclining Buddha temple. Perfect day although we did get stuck in some crazy Bangkok traffic coming back from the floating market. During the day Mr. Nathan bought us Thai iced coffees, a coconut, authentic Thai snacks and soda from different street vendors along the way. Because this was a private tour we were able to decide how long or briefly we wanted to stay at each location. Lunch was also included.Mr. Nathan was also incredibly knowledgeable about the sites and about Thailand and we learned a lot throughout our day.We were picked up at 7:30 and were back at our hotel around 3pm. We took tons of awesome pictures and I would recommend this to anyone not on a backpacker budget. Worth the price for the comfort and convenience. Also, booking was very easy via email and we just paid cash day of."

When reserving tours in various countries where there is a language barrier I am sometimes frustrated but that was NOT the case with BKK, they responded to our emails promptly and professionally which set the tone for the level of quality we would receive. We were sent an invoice 2 weeks prior to the trip so it was paid ahead of time.We did the Bangkok Highlight tour with AIR who is absolutely amazing. She is knowledgeable, familiar with all the right people and very determined to make sure you have the best experience. By the end of the day she was like FAMILY!!! We chose not to have a car which I think was much better because we were able to view Thailand as the locals, we took a tuk-tuk, boat, long tail boat and even the train! Throughout the day Air would stop at local vendors and allow us to taste the fresh fruit and boiled coconut juice among other delicacies. The lunch was DELICIOUS!!!! I am a vegetarian and the meal was very accommodating.The Royal Palace was my favorite and we learned that not only is Air a great tour guide but she is an experienced photographer who took some of the most amazing pictures of us!!!Overall it was the perfect tour that gave us a real sense of Bangkok's history as well as life for local Thai people.Thanks Again Air!! We Miss You!!!"

They were at the hotel lobby for our pick up when they said they were going to be. Air the tour guide was a lovely lady, very warm and friendly and the transfer vehicle, was like a MPV Limo. Immaculately clean. fresh fruit, water and cold towels every time we stopped. Lunch was inc in our package and it was a lovely fresh hot Thai meal over looking the Dam in a restaurant, not a warm soggy sandwich in the car. Air kindly took pictures for us the whole day so we have lots of 'Us' shots, rather then taking them of each other and her knowledge was great too. We had in car entertainment on the way home with nibbles and drinks, bit like a mobile cinema :-) I would definately recommend BKK. They did everything to make our day out as pleasureable and more. They even added a visit to the Kwai Bridge on the way home to stretch our legs, which we had not booked. All in all fab and highly recommeded."

My wife booked us on a private Bangkok tour with BKK after doing plenty of research and on the strength of the BKK trip advisor reviews. We had our tour with 'M' who was simply one of the best guides we have had anywhere in the world. He was engaging, interesting and a pleasure to spend the day with. We visited a large number of locations around the city including the grand palace, temples, markets and the klongs. Anyone who may have concerns about using local transport, don't. It was a fantastic way to get around and provides plenty of options for the guide to get you to the sights as speedily as possible. We used a taxi, sky train, ferries and tuktuks (definitely the best). M always had a plan depending on the traffic and as it's Bangkok there is plenty of that. Lunch was provided in a local restaurant and there opportunities to grab a drink when required as it was very hot. We completed our tour by having drinks sat on the terrace of a restaurant opposite Wat Arun as the sun went down. Perfect. Personal highlights for us were the boat ride through the Klongs, the visit to the Grand Palace, visiting the local markets that you wouldn't normally get the chance to see on a bus tour And The general way we were looked after by M throughout the day. It happened to be wife's birthday on the day of our tour, it really was the perfect way to spend it according to her. I don't believe you could have a better arranged tour of Bangkok and from our point of view, a better guide than we had.Thank you BKK, you made our trip to Bangkok."

Air collected us the first day and did a tour of the temples followed by an excellent lunch at The Navy Club next to the river. Next stop was the flower and vegetable market. We then went up the river on a private long tail boat and saw the housing on the canals. The transport used was underground, sky train and tuk tuk. We paid \u00a3130 for this in British pounds on the day.The following day we were picked up by Air and a driver in the most luxurious people carrier we have ever been in. It was fully customised and had wifi. We drove to the market at Tha Kha which was lovely as hardly any tourists were there. She bought us fish stomach soup to try. We then went along the canals on a rowing boat to see a family cocoanut sugar production facility. This was very interesting and informative. We couldn't believe how peaceful this area was. Lunch was at a Cabbage and Condoms restaurant and was very good. Next we went to the train market and saw the train come in. We then had coffee and went back to the tracks to see the train go out again. Our next stop was the prisoner of war cemetery and museum followed by the bridge over the river Kwai. The shopping around the bridge is plentiful and good for the usual tourist tat at cheap prices. It then took 3 hours to get back to the hotel so we fully reclined the seats and tried to sleep. This trip cost \u00a3150 and we paid in British pounds on the day.Although these trips were on the expensive side we were more than happy to pay to be taken where we wanted to go with no hassle from scammers and without having to think for ourselves."

We decided to tour Bangkok on day one, overnighting in the Shangri-La hotel, and Ayutthaya on day two. During the planning phase Michiel, the owner, was extremely helpful and patient as we had some clear ideas about what we wanted to see in Bangkok. Some of these sights were doable, and some not due to the limited time and we were able to agree an itinery that suited and book our tours with BKK.Ms Air, our excellent and delightful tour guide was there waiting for us when we exited the cruise terminal. After introductions we were on our way in the luxury minivan, with full air-conditioning and extremely comfortable seats. Within minutes we knew the tour was going to be memorable, and it turned out beyond memorable. Nothing was too much trouble for Ms Air, she gave us some of the history of Bangkok and all the sights we would see...all delivered in excellent English....her smile, personality and gracious beauty is a pure delight.In Bangkok we saw things that most tourists would never see, how some of the poorest of the locals lived and Ms Air knew where to pick up the best snacks and drinks for us along the way. We also saw the main tourist sites and a couple of markets, and Ms Air led us carefully through the crowds at every site, always explaining the background and history and answering all our questions....nothing was any trouble. Towards the end of the day, we experienced a private canal ride on a long tail boat, and a tuk tuk ride to get close to our hotel on the river before crossing in a ferry which serviced all the hotels along the river. Amazing, and never to be forgotten, experiences.We travelled up to Ayutthaya the following day, again by luxury minivan to e \"European style\" temple and then a 45 minute long tail boat ride into the heart of the Ayutthaya Unesco site. It was fantastic, and the luxury minivan was already there to take us on the other parts of the Ayutthaya tour.Lunch both days was provided, and excellent, and at every stop we were given a bottle of ice cold water and wipes etc. to cool down. All of those little touches, as well as the snack food and drinks along the way were so much appreciated by our group.Sadly we had to drive back to the port, and part from Ms Air who had become our close friend as well as guide for those two days. They were the most memorable two days all trip which, for us extended to four weeks in the Far East, and these experiences will be a lifelong memory for all of us.You will not be disappointed....this was a 6-star experience, but the Tripadvisor rating only goes to 5!! Thank you Ms Air, and also to Michael for the pre-tour planning."

It gave us the confidence to travel around the city on our remaining days in Bangkok. Nadia was lovely and we learnt so much about the temples we saw and their history. We were sorry to say goodbye on our final day. On the second day we visited a floating market, the railway market and Chinatown. We saw very few tourists and the tour was so flexible that we had an impromptu lunch in a restaurant overlooking the river. Our driver this day and the third day when we visited Ayutthaya was Mr S. He was an excellent driver and looked after our needs with water and refreshing towels when we returned to the van. He also joined us for another delicious lunch at a local restaurant. I would have no hesitation in recommending BKK tours and would definitely use them again."

Ms Emmy was more like a friend taking us around. Mr Ed was always there with his van when needed.We had to shorten our trip because Royal Caribbean demanded we be back on board by 1500hr so instead of a restaurant trip Emmy and Ed arranged a picnic for us to eat in the van on the way back to the ship.We booked on our own stay at the Banyan Tree Hotel which is very good especially the Moon Bar. We also booked the Banyan Tree Apsera river dinner cruise and that was superb."

We got far more than we thought was possible. We arranged a visit to the Erawan waterfall and then on to the Elephant sanctuary at Kanchanaburi on the River Kwai. Everything was included. The transport was like aircraft first class. Our guide, Ms Air was superb. She spoke perfect English, answered every question, took great pictures with our cameras when we were swimming or feeding the elephants, had a great sense of humour, and a smile from ear to ear. The picnic turned out to be a Thai banquet set in beautiful surroundings, all arranged by Ms Air and all in with the price. On the way back, and not planned, Air managed to fit in a short visit to the Bridge over the River Kwai, just as the sun was setting. It was a perfect day. We cannot speak more highly of this company, they made our visit to Thailand excellent."

She explained a lot of the history of the markets to us without overwhelming us with information, and took the time to talk to us about about Bangkok, from current events to restaurant recommendations.The floating market tour isn't specifically billed as a food tour, but Ms. Air bought us a lot of delicious snacks throughout our trip. She seemed to know the best spots and most friendly people at each stop. I ate things on this tour I'd never even think to try that turned out to be delicious - the soup from the traditional floating market we visited may be the best thing I've ever had! Ask her to try the tasty little dessert balls in stapled banana leaves if you visit the Maeklong Railway Market.I'd recommend you book well in advance of your trip because Ms. Air said they book up quickly!

This tour was great, Oi took us to the train station where we boarded a train to the slum areas. The train was interesting in itself with many local people aboard and people moving through the train selling food items. We departed and then walked through a local food market, Oi explaining things along the way. We then walked along a train line through a local housing area, interacted with some friendly locals along the way and really saw how these people live. We visited a local shop and a school and just generally observed everyday life.Next we took a canal boat towards the Grand Palace and finally a tuk tuk to the gate. Oi took us through the palace and was able to explain the various areas and the significance of them.I was a bit apprehensive about this tour and if it would be too confronting for our children (aged 10 and 13) but I had no concerns on the day. It was excellent and a good learning opportunity for the children. I feel it is important for them to see that cities are not necessarily just hotels/shopping malls and tourist attractions.The second day Oi took us by taxi to China Town. We explored local temples and the back alleys of this area. Oi pointed out to us different foods and explained the food preparation to us. It was all very interesting and gave us an opportunity to see things that we would never see if we were on our own. Those back alleys are a whole other world! We then visited the Golden Buddah and again Oi was available to explain the significance of this area to us.Overall 2 excellent days and I would highly recommend taking a tour with Oi and BKK tours!"

We took a tuk tuk, the sky train, long tail boat and walked around discovering Bangkok and we really felt like we had an authentic experience. We visited the grand palaces, the flower market, we did a long boat tour of Bangkok harbour and visited some markets - it was fantastic value and Ms Nadia couldn't have been lovelier! We had a brilliant time. I would absolutely recommend BKKTours and I hope to come back and book another tour!"

Spent the last two days with Air, co-owner of BKK Tours and what an experience!The first day we visited the must see sights around the city traveling by taxi, long boat, tuk tuk and skytrain. She maneuvered us around the crowds at the Grand Palace and various temple buildings. Her knowledge and pride in her country's history added a whole other depth to the tour. On the second day we traveled out of the city to visit some of the more interesting markets including the railroad station, floating, flower and wet markets. Stopping for tastes of the Thai life every where.Air continuously looked out for our comfort, personal needs and appetites. Looking back at the last two days we quickly realized that we would not have come close to scratching the surface of the things to see or do had we tried it alone.Don't try to seek the REAL Bangkok on your own. You need a guide...you need BKK Tours."

I asked the lovely and warm Air to take me to all the places in Bangkok that she liked and cared about herself. I can tell you all it was the best day of my whole trip to Asia. Air was sensitive to me and my needs, caring, warm and informative. She brought me to various hidden spots in Bangkok and balanced a \"must see\" attractions with some hidden and magical spots now one would take you other than a local that knows the place inside and out. She didn't safe any expenses on me and that included amazing breakfast and lunch as well as all other amazing attractions. I cannot express my gratitude to this company and highly, highly recommend.Oren Raz"

We booked 2 tours with BKK Tours - a half-day tour of the Train (Railroad) Market and Floating Market, and a night tour of the Wats, Chinatown and Flower Market. Our guide for both tours, Air, was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and took care of our needs at all times (we had a 70+ elderly mother with us). For the authentic markets tour, we sampled treats at a local market and had great coffee and tea next to the railway tracks before the train came whizzing past. Wow, the train was just 2 inches away from where we were standing! Next part of the journey was climbing onto a local teak rowing boat and brought to a local palm sugar farm. No tourists, no souvenir shopping - just how a local Thai family works on their farm. The night tour was our favourite - we visited Wat Po in its lighted splendor without the crowds, had dinner at a lovely restaurant located just opposite Wat Arun which was also beautifully lighted up, and visited the Flower Market and Chinatown in tuk-tuks, It was a lovely experience! Highly recommended !"

As the trip approached, Michiel helped us via email to create a custom itinerary based on our individual preferences. We didn't have much time in the city, so we wanted to see a lot all in one day. Our tour ended up being 10 hours long and we went to: - Tha Kha floating market -- located 1 hour outside Bangkok and is authentic, very few tourists - amazing! Our guide, Air, knew all the best (and clean) vendors to sample local foods - Railway market -- located outside Bangkok and is a MUST SEE. Best with a tour guide because you can easily get lost and we did not meet anyone who spoke English. Air took us to the Thai coffee stand - the coffee was amazing!- Lunch at a local restaurant - We dined at a local favorite right on the water. Air helped us select the best dishes (family style dining). We ate with Air and she taught us about local customs and key Thai phrases - Grand Palace -- Also a must see if traveling to Bangkok; Huge place so be ready to walk. Air shared many incredible stories about each temple and other pieces of art. Be sure to wear clothes that cover knees and shoulders. - Reclining Budda -- last stop of the day and we were tired! We didn't stay long but the venue is much smaller than the Grand Palace so you can see this in 30-60 minutes. One of the best things about this tour is that your tour guide will make all your purchases for you with local vendors and with his/her own money. This is included in the total cost of the tour. It is so easy this way - no hassling with money required. BKK tours is the way to go! Best in Bangkok!"

Our tour guide, M, was a great tour guide as well. Very friendly and he also gave us good tips about where to eat and the places to go in Bangkok that weren't on our tour.

We toured all day seeing the sites I wanted to see in the order that worked best for logistics. It was a multi modal day full of interesting sites - smells and sounds.

We had originally booked 2 full-day tours but, due to an itinerary problem, we ended up returning to Bangkok so quickly contacted BKK to arrange for another day. Luckily we were able to get the same tour guide - Miss Oi - who is the most charming and efficient young lady. The vehicles and drivers used were excellent and everything went 100% smoothly. I will be returning to Bangkok in 4 months and have already booked another day with BKK and Miss Oi! Highly recommend this company. They aren't cheap but you get what you pay for in life!"

We went to the non-touristy floating market and then took a small boat down canals to a working palm plantation. Lastly we visited a huge native market where twice a day a train comes rolling thru the middle of the market as the vendors quickly pull their goods off the tracks. They picked us up at our hotel and our van was top notch with the driver providing wet towels and cold water. We each pd $60 for the half day and felt it a good price for our exceptional time"

I knew they would be good based on the detailed information shared during various emails. They are extremely organized and willing to make our trip exactly what we needed. Ms. Pary was our guide for Bangkok and not only was she extremely kind and knowledgeable, but she taught us so much about Buddhism and Thai culture. The only thing to note about Ms. Pary, who we adored, is that while extremely confident and warm, she is a bit soft spoken and if you are a little hard of hearing or with a group bigger than 4-5 I would maybe ask for another guide (but again, we thought she was amazing!). A few days later Ms. Air (the owner) took us 4 hours outside of Bangkok and we enjoyed swimming in the waterfalls, ate a huge and delicious lunch and then had the experience of a lifetime at an elephant sanctuary. We also traveled in style in a big, very clean, comfortable and decked-out van that made the long drive so easy. Air was wonderful and not only taught us a lot but she was also a great photographer so she held on to our camera and took shots while we swam and played which was a great help. And when we accidentally left a pair of sunglasses in the van she very kindly went out of her way to return them to our hotel the next day. If this tour company seems a little more expensive than others, and I'm not sure it is since there are absolutely no add on/surprise fees, I would say it is completely worth it. The price difference is small for such a well run company."

Since I have never booked any type of tour over my many years of global travel, it did not really occur to me that one's tour guide becomes just as much an essential part of the tour as the sites and locations visited on the tour itself. The guide controls the pace, timing, duration, approach and historical background rendered with each stop; she influences the whole experience with her personality, demeanor, attitude and level of enthusiasm; she can make or break a tour by what kind of person she is, both professionally, and in her heart. It was my great fortune to have had the finest guide I could possibly have had. And while I have no others with which to compare her, I am certain I could not have found a more enthusiastic, gentle, caring, considerate, compassionate guide, who also happens to be the co-owner of BKK Tours, along with her husband Michiel. She will breathe life into your Bangkok visit, and her name, appropriately, is Air.I wrote to Michiel and Air after finding them here on Trip Advisor. I asked that we custom-design a one day tour for me, as my time in Bangkok was limited, and my interests very specific. Their communication was superb and their personalized suggestions were a perfect fit. Michiel even did a bit of useful research for me regarding shipping packages within Thailand.Air was waiting for me at exactly the appointed hour, and we ventured forth, creating a wonderful day filled with sites, sounds, smells, and other interactions, with a Bangkok I could not have experienced without her. The time we spent was so comfortable, it was as if I had known her for years.Of course, everyone will do their own research regarding whom to choose as their tour guides in Thailand. But after exploring the many other options available to you, please return to this honest, heartfelt review. BKK Tours is a small company, owned by two lovely people who bring the highest possible standards to their work. As a mature American gentleman, I trust my ability to judge the professional and personal character of others. You will find none higher than Michiel and Air's (and, I'm sure, their other staff) at BKK Tours. Thank you Michiel and Air!"

Michiel's reply was prompt despite the time difference & this alone impressed me. So many enquiries go unanswered. I had decided what we wanted to see & although not on his website, Michiel tailored a trip to our requirements. Our guide< my apologies cannot remember her name>, was excellent, probably the best guide we have ever had on all our travels! Our driver was polite & so caring, meeting us with a smile, cool towels & iced water & his vehicle was top notch! All refreshments were included in the price & the al la carte lunch at a restaurant we would never have found on our own, was fanatastic! The best thing was we went to see attractions we were interested in & at no point were we rushed as one so often is. I would recommend BKK Tours to everyone wanting to do a trip in Bangkok. Just the best! Wished Michiel operated from other areas as well."

I had to figure a way to see most of the great sites in a day. I checked here on TA and decided to e-mail Michiel at BBK tours, he responded promptly.We decided on a Bangkok Highlights tour as it would cover most of what she wanted to see. Ms. Oi was our guide, she is very knowledgeable with BKK and spoke great English.I won't go into the details of the tour but for the cost of a private tour that included the price of everything including taxi, tickets to landmarks, lunch, Tuk-Tuk's Etc.. this was a bargain. I rarely do any sort of organized tours but this was one I can highly recommend even if this is not your first time to Thailand."

We were not disappointed. On the first day we went to Kanchanaburi on the Burmese border to see the Death Railway and the Bridge over the River Kwai, driven by Peter in a luxury van with reclinging seats and cold towels and water in abundance, and a delicious lunch included. The experience itself was sobering, but the overall standard and the lengths gone to by the BKK staff to ensure our comfort were second to none. On the second day we toured Chinatown on foot and by public transport - fascinating to explore and great photo ops. The guide on both trips - Ms Pary - proved herself to be indispensable, very friendly and accommodating, and knowledgable about the places we were visiting. All in all, I would have to say that these were two of the best tours I have ever taken anywhere, with anybody, and I would not hesitate to recommend them if you happen to be visiting this fabulous city."

We booked the Bangkok highlights tour.We met our tour guide Pary at the port of Laem Chabang which is around 2 hours outside Bangkok. As there was only me and my partner on this private tour Pary made sure that our drive into Bangkok was interesting and covered local history as well as answered out cultural queries with no awkward silences., the flower market, and a nice long tail boat tour to see the local life in the Venice of the East.We started at the flower market due to crazy traffic in Bangkok that morning which was great and we experienced some street food and the best Iced coffee from a little stall which was the best I have ever tasted! After this we got a Tuctuc to the Grand Palace following that we visited Wat Phra Kaeo andWat Pho with the reclining Buddha. Pary was very knowledgeable about all the temples and have us a far greater insight of what we were seeing if we were to do this trip on our own which have us a better understanding of what we were seeing. She also showed us pictures of things to show us how things would be during ceremony's etc.After this we asked if there was any have we could get some gifts and Pary kindly directed us to a less touristy market where we found some bargains. After all that the tour was topped off with a private long boat tour where we fed fish outside a temple. I cannot fault the attentiveness of our guide and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending BKK tours to friends and family or even using them again ourselves. Pary is an absolute credit to BKK tours and my partner and I will always have great memories of this place thanks to her."

Within minutes we were comfortable with her, and it felt more like a hospitable friend was taking us around than like a tour guide! Nadia led us to the most luxurious mini van and we were on our way to the floating markets and railway market. Nadia was always alert to the needs of both my husband and I and our kids (7 & 9 years), buying the kids ice creams and snacks to try. She even bought the kids a souvenir at the markets for them to take home with them! My daughter became a little unwell during the day and we were able to head back to the hotel a little early. That is the advantage of a personal tour - no waiting with a sick kid on a crowded bus while the tour group forges ahead! When we return to Bangkok we will definitely be back for another tour with BKK!"

Initially, I contacted a couple of tour options and Michiel's replies were the most professional and prompt. Our guide for the day of Bangkok highlights was Nadia. She was at our hotel lobby far before the time she needed to be, all ready to go. This lady was one of the highlights of our whole trip to Thailand and I cannot speak highly enough of her extensive local knowledge and history of her country. We learnt so much and on our return I made our kids write homework and notes of everything they learned. Yes we learnt far more about Thailand in one day with Nadia, than of our 11 days prior in Phuket. Nadia adapted the trip to suit our requests - after our initial welcome chat - we caught the tuk tuk to the flower market and then to the Grand Palace and Temple of reclining Buddha. We had the most wonderful weather for touring BKK - CLOUDY!!! no hot sun, no rain - perfect! After that we had lunch by the river, then went on our hour long canal tour by long tail (with life jackets, thank you! :) Finally, we caught the skytrain back to our hotel and had a lovely chat with Nadia to conclude. Along the way during the day - Nadia purchases all tickets and you don't need to queue up anywhere at all OR negotiate prices. We parted by having family photos and hugs with Nadia. And as others have said, felt like a new friend had been made. I am so annoyed that I forgot to share our New Zealand nick nacks that we had taken all that way for that purpose so I will attempt to post them over to Nadia. This tour cost us $350 NZD for a full 8hour day with Nadia. If you were keen to arrange and do this all by yourself as a couple without kids or similar to be bothered, it would probably be much less. I would not change a thing - absolutely perfect day out for our family. Thank you Michiel, BKK Tours and the lovely Nadia. DO offer Nadia a tip for her professionalism, absolutely and totally worthwhile."

She was great, very professional, showed up as discussed and because I was the only one on the tour she was very flexible, if we wanted to stop we could stop etc... Got a very good look at the city in a relatively short space of time. This sort of tour would be easy to do yourself but would take a lot longer and you miss out on all the insider information. Oi spoke very good English and was very helpful with any of the requests I made.There were no \"cultural stops\", i.e. you are shuffled into some sort of basket weaving place and expected to buy their products after a one hour \"demo\" etc...There was some confusion as to the use of camera tripods, which puzzled me somewhat, especially as we were paying customers. I was wanting to use a tripod to get a nice picture of a temple from our dinner spot but checking with the restaurant owner had this request denied, also similar result from the Skybar (I think that was what its name was, gives you a nice view of the city from a high-rise). Other than those small issues can highly recommend BKK, they are fantastic."

The price is very fair for a personalized tour guide who follows you every where.The highlight tour consists of the visit to the Royal Palace, Leaning Buddha, Lunch at the Royal Navy Restaurant, Flower Market, and a boat ride through the canals. We opted for the regular tour without the private car (which runs only $75) as we wanted to learn how to get around like locals do.There were pleasant surprises on the trip but I won't ruin it for you.It was a hot humid and sometimesWet morning. We tried to get started as early as possible to beat the crowds and we did so. She went at our pace (we sped through the entire tour in about 5.5 hours).The tour guide was knowledgable and was comforting to us as we had trouble with the humidity + heat. (We are from Los Angeles so weather is warm but dry). She purchased water, cooling towels and drinks for us to make sure we were comfortable. At the end of our tour she took us back to the hotel via BTS (bangkok transit system) and showed us how to use it. The next day we mastered on how to get around. I'm so happy with my bookings with BKK!!!!"

I was told by multiple people that Bangkok would not be as fun and I should only spend a few days there. So since we had a limited amount of time I wanted to take a tour to really experience as much of Bangkok as possible. I learned that 2 days was simply not enough time in Bangkok and that I should have taken a tour at the beginning of our trip. Right away she showed us how to talk to/ negotiate with local vendors, taxi drivers, took took driver etc. Even though Thai is one of the nicest and most respectful cultures I've seen. If your a tourist. Just like everywhere else in the world if you don't know better your paying a premium on everything. Ok so about BKK tours. I found them threw trip advisor and as soon as I read the reviews and spoke to the owner mike. I knew this would be the right fit for us. When our guide arrived to pick us I didn't know what to expect, I mean spending the entire day with a stranger in a foreign country can seem overwhelming or at least to me it can. We got so lucky with Peri!!! A local soft spoken, kind hearted person that was so informative and knowledgeable of the local attractions and culture. We went to the local fruit and flower market witch was really cool to see, then went the royal palace witch despite being so hot was an amazingly beautiful place. Peri knew everything!! I love to ask lots of questions and there wasn't a single one she couldn't answer. Honestly I learned more about Thai culture this day then I did the entire 2 weeks before the tour. Then off to a two huge beautiful temples. It's very humbling to see the monks, traditions, the art, the architecture and the culture. All of it is awesome. The big Buddha is a must see. BKK paid for a lot of stuff, snacks, fruit, water, lunch. I almost felt guilty letting Peri pay so much. She was carrying our bags, taking pictures and just being all around pleasant. We got very lucky! Thank you BKK and Peri! Keep up the good work! Until next time :) Michael & Shauneet"

River boat, tuk tuk, long tail boat, skytrain, subway, and to top it all off Nadia convinced us to do a short motorbike taxi back to our hotel from the skytrain station nearby. A fantastic alternative bunch of ways to get around the city rather than sitting in heavy traffic for hours!We have left exchanging email addresses with Nadia, under strict instructions to keep in touch and if we decide to get married in Thailand, we now have a wedding planner lol.A great day out that ended with us making a friend.

As this was outside of their usual tours Air and Michiel took the time and effort to put together a custom made programme with detailed itinerary and costings. They also helped with suggestions for hotels and were also happy to accommodate some late changes without any problem. Travelling with a friend Air picked us both up from Suvarnabhumi airport being driving with us in a private minibus to Hua Hin where we spent three nights. During our time there we visited some of Hua Hin's excellent night markets and visited the nearby Khao Sam Yoi Rot national park.From Hua Hin we drove directly to Kanchanaburi (my second visit), where again stayed at the Oriental Kwai Resort. Air had arranged a three day programme of tours, including Hellfire Pass (walking the full trail this time), the Prathat Cave and the Erawan Waterfalls. Erawan was slightly disappointing, partly due to low water levels and partly due to the number of tourists (we visited on a Saturday). After a couple of free days we were driven to Bangkok for four nights and two further tours. The photo tour with Air and Michiel was excellent, both as an introduction to photography and seeing different parts of Bangkok (ranging from a meat and fish market to Wat Arun). The final day's touring with Air visited the wonderfully quiet Suan Pakkard Palace and the impressive Royal Barges Museum. Throughout this year's touring Air was unfailingly friendly and helpful. As others have mentioned it felt was travelling with a friend rather than a tour guide, albeit a very knowledgeable friend. Thanks also to Air for being trip photographer and supplying copies via Dropbox. I would also like to mention the excellent Mr Sak, our minibus driver, who took good care of us throughout. I highly recommend BKK Tours and look forward to using them again in 2015."

We had 6 days in Bangkok and 2 of them was in the delightful company of this first class tour group. We arranged a full day Highlights of Bangkok ( see website for details) and what a clever idea to try the many forms of transport available including the subway, tuk tuk, taxi and long boat. We were met at our Hotel, Grande Sheraton on Sukhumvit Road by the beautiful guide Oi who gave us the VIP treatment all day. Cold water, icy cold towels were purchased, she took our photo and a genuine love of knowledge of culture, history and current daily life was shared. My partner had never been to Bangkok before and he became a fan due to Oi's stories. Lunch at the Navy Club, without chilli, was delicious and of course included ! We saw it all including the canals with frenzied fish feeding.

Who else knows when to arrive at places WITHOUT other tourists.............to arrive without crowds was stunning ! His hints, tips and encouragement and follow up were stunning !

Mr A the driver, was wonderful with water and towels and who else would sing \" I wish I could fly\" as we got stuck in Bangkok traffic for nearly 2 hours ! What a superstar !

I do craft work and wanted buttons and lace and thought a translator would be helpful ! She was magnificent and tried to barter for me, made sure the quality was good and it was like shopping with a friend. We were jam packed in the hot and steamy lanes of Chinatowns shuffling looking in stores for buttons and making a dive when we could. We eventually found a good one and she helped me fossick !

I recently visited Bangkok alone, I am a female, on business and I wanted to see the sites without the hassle of all the scammers that you find at the public sites. I also didn\u2019t want to navigate between sites because the taxi drivers can be very difficult about turning on their meters so I decided that I would try a tour company and pay for a private guide. BKK was very professional, polite, and honest from our first communication. Michiel, the Dutch owner, responded to my email request immediately. He sent brochures, prices, and told me that the tour could be altered to my needs. He was very accommodating. I selected the Bangkok highlight tour and it was certainly worth the money. My tour guide took me to additional sites, such as a 200 year old community next to the palace (whose residents were not originally allowed to settle inside the palace walls) and another temple where they had meditation chairs (neither was listed on our list of venues to see). We took a variety of Tuk Tuks (which was unique and so much fun), we ate a local restaurant on the water, and took a water taxi. In general, it was just relaxing because you paid up front and then didn\u2019t worry about money the rest of the day. The tour guide buys you local sweets or other food to try, teas, coffees, etc. so you come away from the tour having experienced many things that you would not have tried on your own. At the temple of the Reclining Buddha, do ask for details about the pictures on the bottom of the foot. I also recommend that you go around to the backside of the Buddha and purchase the 20 Baht cup of coins (most tourist don\u2019t do this). You take each coin and throw it into the metal pots lining the wall. You can express a thought with each toss of the coin or be thankful for something in your life. It is an authentic experience and you come away feeling better for the 20 Baht donation to the temple. BKK tour treats you well; they quote a price and deliver on every aspect of their promise. If you want a hassle-free tour, one where you can just relax, I highly recommend using them."

It started out as a generic inquiry email which I sent to a couple of private tour companies to express my interest in a couple of tour attractions such as floating market, train market and tiger temple.Theirs was the ONLY private tour company to email me back with a very polite email written in faultless English that they are sorry but they have a company policy of not doing tours at the Tiger Temple as they don't agree with the treatment of the tigers at the Tiger Temple. I liked how Michiel, the owner of BKK Tours also took the trouble to include a couple of links in his email on the shockingly unethical practices over at the Tiger Temple. I was enlightened and decided to go with the only company who obviously valued ethics as much as I do.I am so glad I decided on BKK Tours because my husband and I had a fantastic experience with them. We opted for the Train market, floating market, caves and Chinatown tour. Every tour was amazing and offered an introspective look at how the local people live, through the eyes of a local guide.I would love to go back to Bangkok and do other tours with this company. A must-do, in my humble opinion. Bangkok has so much more to offer than just great food & shopping, cheap massages and a vibrant nightlife!"

A must see if you have time. We were picked up in a luxurious van filled with ice cold water and ice cold toilettes. The Floating Market was our highlight of this day and entire trip!The 2nd tour we took was a personalized tour to Grand Palace, Wat Arun(the reclining Buddha) and a few other stops we requested including Massage at the Thai temple. Oi was such a great guide. She explained everything in full detail and also showed us how to make an offering and ritual of fortune telling sticks. I would recommend BKK Tours and Oi to anyone traveling to Bankok!"

Our guide was wonderful and spoke English very well. She was informative, friendly, and funny. Her name was Air, but I have no idea how you spell it in Thai. She provided us with information about the locations we visited along with several Thai customs and traditions we were interested in learn about. The canal cruise was a must see because you get to see the Venice of the East along with a lot of wildlife including several monitor lizards on the shore and swimming in the waters. She spent as much time in each place as we wanted and adjusted the tour based on what we had done the previous evening. She took us to a market and bought us several treats to try. Traveling around in the tuk tuks from location to location was a tour in itself. Great day and tour to see the highlights of Bangkok especially when you are only visiting for a short period. I would definitely use this tour company again and recommend them to others."

I used the website to send an inquiry about booking a city tour. Michiel responded very quickly and we arranged everything by email. My guide, Emmy, was so friendly, energetic, and informative. She showed me a great time around the city. I felt like a VIP being given a private tour of the city!As far as the tour goes, we met in Bangkok and took a river boat to Wat Arun. Then walked to Wat Pho. Stopped for a coffee then toured the Grand Palace grounds and Wat Phra Kaew. We stopped for a delicious lunch at a restaurant on the river then took a canal tour on a long tail boat which ended at the Flower Market. We toured the Flower Market and ended the day with a Tuk Tuk ride to the subway station where I took a taxi back to my hotel. The sites were great - like nothing I've seen before. Thank you Michiel and Emmy!"

We did 2 days worth of tours in June 2014 with BKK: the Bangkok Highlights (full day) and the Floating Market/Railway Market (half day). Our tour guide was a young woman named Nadia.Simply put, this was the best tour we've ever been given, anywhere in the world. We expected a lot for the price we paid... and Nadia surpassed our expectations.On the first day, Nadia picked us up right on time in our hotel lobby. She then took us to the flower market in Bangkok which is filled with incredible sights and smells. She bought my girlfriend a flower bracelet made of jasmine and roses. We then went on to the Royal Palace/Golden Pagoda, an amazing lunch by the river (which was included in the price, unbeknownst to us!), before taking us to the Reclining Buddha. We ended the day with a long boat tour down the river and a visit to Wat Arun. On the second day, Nadia picked us up bright and early and took us to the Tha Kha Floating market. This particular floating market is only open on certain days - and lucky for us, it was open that day. We absolutely loved it. We were the only tourists there and it felt like a truly authentic Thai experience. We sat and ate all sorts of delicious, locally made cuisine, including noodles, soups, chicken, dumplings, deserts, drinks, etc. Don't eat a big breakfast before you go on this tour! We then went down the river on a small boat and visited a coconut farm, which was a surprise and a delight. We got to see how a small family makes coconut sugar for sale, and we even got to try our hand at helping out. The rest of the day was spent at the Railway market (the one where the train goes through the market and all the vendors quickly close up and then re-open). That was pretty cool.On to Nadia: what can we say about her? Simply outstanding. She was very attentive; always providing us with water, cold towels, and buying us little snacks and flowers (she bought us so much stuff, I started to worry that she was being TOO nice! I hope she was compensated by her employer). She would go out of her way to make sure we were happy. What surprised us the most (in a pleasant way) was how much we learned about Thai culture, history, religion, and politics simply by chatting with Nadia. Somehow, she was able to convey tons of information to us in a very straightforward manner and in a very limited amount of time. We learned so much, experienced so much, and even learned how to speak basic Thai, all because of Nadia's efforts. Huge bonus points to her for so often taking our camera and shooting pictures of us together.We took the BKK tours on our first two days in Thailand. What a wonderful way to start a vacation. Thank you Nadia!"

This month I visited Bangkok again with my wife and it was another great trip with them. We requested Air and Gift as our guides and the whole experience with them was just wonderful. Michiel (the owner) was very helpful with organizing and gave great advice to us. We were a bit worried because of the current political situation in Thailand but after we arrived we found that all our worries were just groundless. Bangkok and Thailand are very safe to travel. This time we did a tour through Chinatown, visited some markets and a very interesting amulet market with Air as our guide. She is extremely resourceful and will show you places of Bangkok you would otherwise have no chance to see. You will meet the local people and with her help can communicate with them. We also did the Bangkok Highlights tour with her. BKK Tours are very well managed and organized, they will never lead you to \"shops\" where you are pushed to buy things like some other tour operators in Thailand do. After Bangkok we visited the Train Market and the Floating Market in Tha Kha and Ayutthaya with the wonderful Gift as our guide. Both Air and Gift have many years of experience as a tour guide and you feel like a friend is showing you around. They introduce you to typical local thai food and we visited Restaurants with them where we were often the only non thai guests. The way they talk to the local people is also very nice to see. They treat everyone with respect and you as their guests take profit form this. BKK Tours is not cheap but ... like always in life; quality has its prize. Will be back with BKK Tours? You can bet on it!!"

What brought us back for another tour this year is that Air is an amazing guide who has such a wealth of knowledge to share.This year we did a tour of the Makkasan slum community and a few less well known but amazing temples, then on to Chinatown. It was an incredibly humbling and emotional experience seeing how people less fortunate than us live in these communities. My main concern before the tour was that we didn't want to be like gawping tourists or in any way disrespectful to these people. I needn't have been concerned as Air is very compassionate and has a wonderful way with people. It was certainly an eye-opening experience we will never forget. We got around on local transport - tuk tuk, train, canal boat and walking. Air was always looking out for us - knowing when to get us out of the heat when we were flagging, pointing out a good camera angle for a photo, reminding us to take napkins from the cafe for the toilet! Everything was taken care of throughout the day - entry fees, transport, drinks, and our lunch which was amazing. So all we had to do was soak up the experience and enjoy. Emails are answered promptly. Tours are easily customised to suit our needs. We have complete trust that we are getting a great service, in fact it is more like we have a friend in Bangkok who is our personal guide. See you next year Air!"

The city sightseeing tour is a must and should be done early in your visit to Bangkok. Not only do you get a wonderful overview of this remarkable city but you also become familiar (and confident) in navigating around the city using the skytrain, tuk tuks, public boats, and taxis. We hired Michiel to accompany us as a professional photographer/teacher to the floating & train markets. That also, was one of our best decisions as his expertise, tips, tricks are something we can use on future trips to make our photographs more \"real\" and full of emotion/expression. I highly recommend BKK tours for anyone wanting a 5 star experience in Bangkok."

Air was knowledgeable, well spoken, friendly, and customer service oriented, but it was the extra touches that set BKK apart- Air buying us food to feed the fish, and drinks and ice cream to sample after a hot tour, finding us shady spots to stand in when we were hot, smoothly handling all entrance fees and financial transactions, taking our photos, advising us on what to wear and bring, having toilet paper available, and instructing us in local customs and rituals with incense, gold leaf, lotus flowers, prayer pennies, etc. Tao also exceeded our expectations by greeting us at his beautiful, comfortable van with a cold towel at the door and a cold bottle of water at each seat after our stops, and entertaining us with his LED party lights and music on the way back to the port! The first day we drove by Chinatown, visited the Grand Palace and the Emerald Buddha, ate a delicious Thai lunch at the Navy Club, took a long tail boat ride on the Chao Phraya River where we fed the catfish, visited the Flower Market and the Wat Pho Reclining Buddha, and stayed overnight at the excellent Center Point Silom. The second day we rode the van to Ayutthaya, rode a cable car across the river to Wat Niwet Thammaprawat and then another long tail boat ride to Ayutthaya historic park. We then took the van past the Elephant park to Wat Lokayasutha for the Reclining Buddha, then to Wat Maha That, had another nice lunch at Pae Krung Kao floating restaurant and fed more fish, and were returned to the port in a timely manner.

We took lots of close up photos , and lastly the Bangkok city tour on day 3... China town, flower market,Wat Arun Grand Palace, Wat Pho.I think we covered a variety of things to see. such good memories.... have told my family and friends about this tour company.

It became apparent to Ms Oi that my boyfriend and I are both foodies and she made a real effort to show us and let us try numerous new foods at the markets/restaurant. Her English was exceptional. The vans were incredibly comfortable and the offer of cold water and towels was much appreciated given the heat. All in all 2 great trips. Thank you BKK!"

I have copied this short message that I wrote to BKK tours as a way of thanking their company and the terrific tour guide we had for two days.\"Can you please pass on our huge thanks to Ms Nes for the fantastic service she provided as one of your guides whilst we were in Bangkok for two days on the 6th and 7th March. We thought Ms Nes was absolutely superb in everything she did and very caring as well.It was also nice to meet you and your wife Air at lunch on one of those days. The highlight of the tour for me would have to be the Railway Market that Ms Nes took us to on the second day, which just happened to be my birthday, and totally made the day for the experience of the visit. Thailand, thanks to BKK tours, is now top of my list as a country to revist and I only hope we can use BKK tours again as they made our visit a memorable experience, one not to forget.\""

Right from the very first email correspondence, it was obvious that Michiel and the team at BKK Tours knew how to deliver, in providing a professional service. My wife and I used BKK Tours to organise a trip to the Tha Kha floating market and the 'famous' train market, along with transportation for a day at Elephants World in Kanchanaburi.Our market guide Raht and driver Captain A, were nothing but exceptional! They provided us with cold water and towels throughout, along with local snacks to try, it felt like a mini food tour as well! The transport was first class, very clean spacious mini van, with reclining seats. The tour as a whole really did feel like we was being embraced by the real Thailand! The train market, well spectacular! It was also arranged after witnessing the train come through the market, to take a ride to the next station, this was done sitting in the drivers cab! Also we need to mention Air, who we met up along the way, again a true professional, as with Raht and Cpt A, by the end of the tour we felt like good friends, and able to have a laugh, and learning new Thai words along the way!Michiel also kindly arranged for a driver and transport for the day, in order for us to visit Elephants World. We was expecting a standard taxi, how wrong was we! Our driver Mr S was at our hotel bang on time, for the early start, with a vehicle that was way beyond in what we was expecting. His driving was exemplary, stopping for refreshments on the 2 1/2 hour drive. It was the little things that Mr S did which topped off a great day, such as providing us with cold towels, when we finished our lunch, something that no one else was given. He even went out of his way to supply us with Pad Thai for the drive back to BKK, which was a really nice surprise, and certainly not expecting.If you are looking for a tour operator whilst in BKK, I would fully recommend to contact BKK Tours. They may cost a little bit more than what other operators offered, but there is a reason for that, it's called a first class professional service.We would not hesitate in using them again.Raht, Cpt A, Mr S, Air, Michiel and all at BKK Tours...khob khun krap"

Our daughter aged 9 expressed how lucky we were to have such a lovely guide. We did the Bangkok Highlights tour which took us to the temples and flower markets. We travelled by tuk tuk, longtail boat and sky train and were provided with a lovely lunch on the river which was included in the tour price. We could order whatever we liked, but Ms Oi was happy to assist with ordering. She was very patient and kind. We got to see how the locals on the river lived around the canals and had the opportunity to feed the catfish. The second day we did the Authentic Markets tour which was also very good. We visited the train markets where an array of unusual food was on display for sale. We were amazed at how the stall holders moved their wares every time a train passed which is up to 8 times a day. Ms Oi purchased some coconut pancakes and fruit for us to taste which were delightful. We visited the floating markets where Ms Oi purchased a sample of mango and sticky rice for us to taste which was very nice. We were supplied with water and refresher towels throughout the trip and given lots of helpful information to assist with the rest of our holiday. The tours were well worth the cost and definitely the best way to find our way around the exciting city of Bangkok. We would not hesitate to recommend BKK for tours in Bangkok."

She took us (2 adults and 2 kids ages 10 and 13) to the Palace and Wat Pho. It was a very hot afternoon but she made certain we had water and shade. She was wonderful! She taught us so much, bought offerings for us to make, was so patient as we took millions of photos, and then took us on 2 tuk tuk rides because the kids loved it so much! Our second day was with Air. We were in a luxurious van as we were driving quite a bit. We visited the train market where she bought sweets and coffee and made sure we had a prime spot when the train came through. We all loved it! Then we popped by the floating market. Very touristy and probably would skip next time. And then we visited Elephant's World. DO THIS! So very much worth the extra cost and an incredible once-in-a-lifetime experience! It's an elephant rescue. We fed a 75 year-old toothless elephant by hand! Then swam in the River Kwai with the elephants. Wow and Wow! Even though we left our hotel at 7 and didn't return until 7 it was worth it all. And Air took many photos for us and even sweetly gave us an elephant gift. Thanks BKK!!!!"

We explained to Michael our interests, likes and dislikes of tours and he put together a bespoke tour designed especially to our needs.We requested Air as our guide and indeed she was a breath of \u201cfresh air\u201d. We saw all the sights we wanted to visit, along with a few \u201chidden gems\u201d, and were delighted with the treats of local delicacies to try. The Thai lunches were wonderful. Our high expectations were more than exceeded!Nothing was too much trouble for Air. We could change the itinerary as we progressed, move along or slow down as we wished. It was geared totally around our needs.On another note the mini van was state of the art with reclining seats, foot rests, TV, plenty of bottled water and chilled damp towels. Amazing!I think Bangkok would have overwhelmed us if we had tried to do it on our own but with the guidance of BKK, their knowledge and experience we had a wonderful time and were left with fantastic memories. We highly recommend them to anyone."

I booked an overnight shore excursion in Bangkok for one person and found people to join me through Cruise Critic. Michiel was prompt and courteous through our many email exchanges as the tour grew to a comfortable nine people and questions arose. (Two more groups from our visiting ship also booked, so well reviewed is BKK Tours.) Upon arrival BKK Tours was ready and waiting at the cruise terminal as planned.Our guide, Ms Air is a personable and charming hostess. She is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about her country and customs, very organized, and has perfect command of the English language. The food on day one was very nice. Bangkok was extremely hot to us westerners, and our lunch was in a nicely air conditioned space - not much to look at. But that didn't really matter. And Michiel took the time to stop by the restaurant to say introduce himself and say hello - nice touch. BKK Tours organized our dinner cruise with Loy Nova for that evening - a great experience as well. Lunch on day two was outstanding, delicious food by the river with a nice breeze.Our driver was very nice - always smiling. Always accommodating. Bottled water, cold towels - nice, personable touches at every turn.I can't say enough about how wonderful our visit was because of BKK Tours. I would use them again in a heartbeat. Thank you Michiel & Air for making our visit to Bangkok so memorable.Best - Brian in NYC"

Both days were remarkable and the office manager, Michiel, was great to work with. We had a sense of confidence from the very beginning, and it was well placed. Know that if you book with BKK Tours, your van will be clean with very strong air conditioning and in great working order. Your tour guide will take remarkable care of you, in addition to imparting a lot of local knowledge. And your driver will be superb.

Prior to our departure, we became concerned about the protests in the city, but because the lines of communication were always open, we knew all would be fine. We were told we would be working with Ms. Oi and were thrilled, having read her reviews on Trip Advisor. She exceeded every expectation. Oi is an energetic and enthusiastic guide who immediately establishes a rapport that makes you feel as though a long time friend is showing you her city. We signed on for the full day Highlights and half day Markets, but Oi made sure she showed us so much more. We engaged in good luck rituals at Wat Ho, enjoyed a sampling of Thai food for lunch at The Navy Department, as well as at the markets, and throughout our time together, an immersion of Thai culture.

With limited time in the city we wanted to experience as much as we could and Michai did that and more. Our trip was using local transport and by foot, so this may not be the way to go for older travellers or those with mobility issues. The tour was long, pick up from hotel promptly at 8 a.m. and drop off where desired at 4 p.m. There is a set itinerary but the personal aspect of the tour allows for flexibility where interests demand. For example, Michai did what no other tour guide was able to during our trip which was sourcing a license plate from Thailand as our son collects these from our family and individual trips. Without interruption in our schedule, Michai thoughtfully arranged a minor diversion to the \"gadget\" market and there indeed was a stall serving our needs! Bravo, Michai! He struck the right balance, giving us as much information as we could have absorbed and allowing some private time also. I think he gauged our level of activity and interest just right. No, its not inexpensive, but considering it is private, all other costs including transportation and lunch etc are included, the benefits easily make it worthwhile."

They were so responsive and helpful with all of my questions. We ended up taking the Bangkok Highlights tour, the Floating Market tour and the day trip to Ayutthaya. We had Air for our first tour, the highlights tour. It was ah-mazing. Just like everyone writes, she felt like a sister to us after the day was over. We didn't want it to end! She was funny and extremely knowledgable and patient. She gave tips on good places to stand for photos, stuff to eat from the street carts. She interacted with the locals so that they would interact with us. We got to experience every type of means of transport available on this tour: tuk tuks, Skytrain, subway, longtail, walking. I felt like we went to places only the locals would know, we never saw any other touring companies. We were having so much fun she took us to Chinatown which I don't think was a part of the tour! Apparantly Air used to do a bike tour thru Chinatown so she knew back alleys and i felt like we got to see what not any other touring companies would show, and we LOVED it. We told her we hoped 2014 would bring us boyfriends so she made a point to take us to Temples and to Buddhas we could pray to for that. I wish the day never ended. How amazing that one person can touch you so much and give the gift of memories that will last forever. Next time we go to Bangkok we will try to say hi to Air again! Our next two tours were with Oi. The floating market one day and then Ayutthaya the next. Oi is the nicest, sweetest person. She is very knowledgable also and one thing I loved about her the most is she genuinely cared about our well-being, always making sure we were ok, not getting hit by trains, getting us to the front so we can see the ceremonies the best. The floating market tour was the BEST. We went to Tha Kha. It was so beautiful and serene, she bought us food from the merchants. At the railway market she knew all the exotic foods we were looking at. I highly recommend the Floating Market tour if you are going to go to Tha Kha (market is based on lunar cycle). The next day in Ayutthaya, the buildings did all of the \"talking\", so it was a leisurely day. I wanted to get blessed by a monk so we went to a temple and did. It was a special day! She helped translate so I knew what he was saying. As a bonus at the end we got to feed some elephants. Before we did, she made a point to tell us that BKK was not a fan of supporting riding elephants or having them do circus tricks, and i was not either, so we simply went to see these beautiful majestic beasts up close and feed them. Peter our driver, gets five stars. Always smiling, offering us water, very friendly. I felt like we were all family after it all was said and done and I was so sad when we said goodbye. I would highly highly recommend you use BKK. They aren't like other tours-doubtful I will ever find a touring company as awesome as them. I wish they had BKK Tours in every city. "

If you're going to Bangkok, if you're trying to figure out your transportation on how to get to sites from your hotel, you're going to have a challenge in the best of times; however, particularly at this time with the unrest continuing and a 60 day state of emergency declared today, as I recall, you really don't have a chance navigating around protests areas in many parts of the city, including the high dollar hotel areas around Ratchprasong, unless you can navigate trains and river transportation like a native. And, that is precisely why you really are strongly advised to hire a private guide--a native!--to help you navigate this amazing city. We debated in December whether we should go to Bangkok in light of the upheaval, but, Air and Michiel, the owners of BKK Tours, hired for us a young Thai man, Michai Bnchai yo, who speaks English as if it were his mother tongue. And, our tour was set for using public transportation so Michai deftly guided us around the trouble spots after picking us up at our hotel in the Ratchprasong area, with his choosing the trains, metro, and river transportation that would avoid the protests. That would not have been possible if we'd been in a tour with a guide and car driver. Since we were traveling paths new to us, the diversions Michai took us on were actually a reward as we saw more things along the routes than we'd have otherwise had the chance. I will add that our hotel was in the Ratchprasong area where there was a major concentration of protestors. We bought a 1/2 day tour and a full day tour, starting at 1PM our first day when we did- Wat Pho (reclining Buddha)- Flower market- Canal tourOur full day tour started at 9:00am and we did:- Chinatown- Lunch- Grand Palace with Wat Phra Kaeo (emerald Buddha).During the full day tour, I had an accident and fell in a boat. In 15 minutes, thanks to Michai, I was delivered by a \"tuk-tuk\" to the emergency room at a hospital for 10 stitches; and, within an hour, was back out of the hospital and on our way again. Air and Michiel came to the hospital as well to see how I was doing. They are great people. My wife and I have \"adopted\" Michai (pronounced \"meesha\")."

Air, our tour guide met us at the cruise ship and we were lucky enough to spend almost 3 days with her. Cities are a combination of the sights and the people you meet. We were blessed to have Air as our guide. Besides the fact that she is totally organized and really knows her subject - she is so genuinely easy to be with. Her English is impeccable - including American slang - Personally, it's all well and good to know your subject- but what is even better is when the tour guide loves her subject as well... the tour becomes really special for the clients.Some must do's ..........Do not miss the floating market and Air's special stop for soup. Do not miss the Railway Market. Do not miss the long boats. Do not miss the Prasart Museum.And thank you-- Air for helping me to purchase a Spirit House. It was hard saying goodbye - it was like spending 3 days with a friend."

She was there in our hotel waiting for us both days. The first day we did the highlights of Bangkok. We used different modes of travel from tuck tuck, taxi, long boat and subway. It was necessary to think fast as the protests had some areas blocked off. At no time did we not feel safe. We are picky eaters but both days Oi took us to restaurants overlooking the water. The food was good and she helped us navigate the Thai menus. My husband doesn't eat vegetables and I can't do spicy or fish. Yes we are an odd lot. The high light was the long boat ride when we stopped at a temple and she gave us 2 bags of buns. This was to feed the cat fish. We could touch them. That day we were dropped off right at our hotel arriving by subway and walking a couple of blocks around the protesters. The next day we went to Anyar Wha by a wonderful van. It was a very posh van and the driver was very good getting us everywhere and picking us up. We enjoyed this more historic tour and again had a wonderful long boat ride. I would not hesitate to book with BKK Tours and MS Oi is a very knowledgeable guide. We were fortunate to have her as our guide. Thank you BKK Tours and Ms Oi for a wonderful if short trip to Bangkok."

I was traveling alone and was worried about pretty much everything, but communication was a breeze and Miss Pary was right on time, super sweet and spoke perfect english. I was so lucky to have such an incredible guide through Bangkok. You take different modes of public transportation which was a really cool way to see the city - and you also take a long tail boat through the canals on the full day tour which was incredible. All of the temples are beautiful, and lunch was at a DELICIOUS spot - so far still one of the best meals that I've had in Thailand. I requested to see a monk for a blessing, and Pary went out of the way to take me somewhere where this could happen. I would not hesitate to suggest this tour to anyone - you get a tremendous value, and if you're lucky enough to get Pary, an incredible experience."

Since we were only there for 2 days, on our way to Australia, we wanted to book a customized tour of the city that would suit our three generations. BKK tours proved to be a perfect choice for us. We couldn't make up our mind between the standard tour of the city (temples) and tour of the markets (floating market, Railway market) out of the city. Michiel offered a combination of the two which was a real bingo! We were picked up in the morning by our guide Ms Gift and a driver. We had a very pleasant ride on a luxury mini-van to the markets some 70 km south of Bangkok. Markets we very exciting - we have never experienced anything like that before. Our son even had a photo taken with a phyton, something to remember for life! Afterwards we returned to Bangkok and had a fantastic lunch by ChaoPraya river. Great choice of food, we loved it all. Our guide, Ms GIft was very informative and helpful throughout the tour. She is very knowledgable and nice person to spend a day with. We visited two temples and a palace and had a tuk-tuk ride in between which thrilled our son. All in all, we had a fantastic day and have definitely decided to come back to Thailand and also try another BKK tour. Keep up the good work, looking forward to see you again!"

They loked after our every need, toilet breaks and food all very important when travelling ith kids!!! Day 2 we the traditional floating markets, the tourist floating markets, the railway markets and temples. Both days included great lunches in great locations. We all learnt so much about Thai history and politics. Our request as to content for each day were easily accommodated, I'd encourage anyone to book with this great company.

A super nice lady, friendly and knew everything about some cool spots, food, entertainment and the attractions. She made the experience even better!We did in one day the Train market, the floating market, we stopped for lunch at a really cool spot close to the river (and the food was to die for) and then some temples.

            "review": "First class tour of Thailand. Long story, short: If you're going to Thailand and want to book a private tour, book with BKK Tours.Here's the long story. I booked with a party of 7 for a day tour of Bangkok. We were traveling on a Holland America cruise with a day stopover so we wanted to hit the highlights. Even though four of us had already been to Bangkok, the other 3 hadn't, so it was one of those \"we'll probably see the same things like last time\" type of trips. I'll hand it to BKK Tours though, with our superb tour guide, Ms. Pary, we saw Bangkok in a whole new way and experienced an entirely different city even while seeing some of the same sites. She was knowledgeable, friendly, went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and entertained. The van we had for the day was well appointed and the driver was a professional at all times - he was able to easily navigate and was always able to pick us up promptly at all destinations. We did a tour of some of the highlights, stopping through a massive flower market and worked our way to the vegetable market. Ms. Pary even stopped and bought local fruit that a member of our party was asking about so we could try it at lunch. We went on to see the temple of the reclining Buddha (Wat Po), took a tuk tuk ride to lunch, ate by the river, went to the Grand Palace and rode through the canals among other activities. The way our activities were spaced out was great, it was a mix of active, cultural, and relaxed - a pace that was comfortable for our group which ranged from 75 to 25 years old. I think what really makes BKK stand out are the little touches. Michiel was extremely prompt in his emails and put us at ease quickly with the information about the tour, etc. We also always had bottles of water, cold towels at just the right time provided throughout the day. Ms. Pary went out of her way to be interactive in her role as a tour guide. It was refreshing to feel her genuine warmth and desire to share various aspects of Thai culture. One example would be when we were in the Grand Palace, she not only pointed out that the gold leaf decorations on the walls were hand applied, when we came across some workers doing that very work, she asked to borrow some to show us how it looked and how they applied it. Little nuggets like that made the tour that much more personal. My husband and I are a \"travel on our own\" type of people, but if I had tour guides like Ms. Pary and tour companies like BKK running tours, I'd definitely choose the latter route purely for what we got out of it."

Ayutthaya is about 90 minutes outside of Bangkok and is an UNESCO world heritage site. Two of us the group like taking photographs so we had agreed a later start so that we could take photographs at sunset. Our guides for the day were Air and Michiel the company owners. Air and Michiel are a good team and compliment each other. Michiel is a photographer and is always willing to give tips and support to ensure that guests are able to capture the best photographs. Air's knowledge about Thai history, history culture and venues visited is endless. They are always willing to customise tours to suit customers.Anyway we were collected from out hotel and transported to Ayutthaya in air conditioned transport. We saw many temples and enjoyed a boat trip before going into the historical park and ruins. Once in the park we saw the Buddha head in a tree and a huge reclining buddha and of course were able to take photos of the ruins at sunset. Each time to you back to the transport there is a cold towel and drinking water waiting for you. There was a sound and light festival in Ayutthaya at the time and the company contacted us to see if we were interested in attending. If you do this trip in December then its worth getting a ticket as its really interesting to see the show and the ruins lit up.Whenever, you do a trip with BKK tours its always a very enjoyable and relaxed day and you always learn things about Thailand and in my case pick up tips about photography. Lunch and drinks are included in the trip price Whenever I want to do a trip in Bangkok, BKK tours is always the first choice."

Our tour guide, Ms. Oi is a very nice lady, speaks good English, knowledgable, organized and great with kids too. It feels more like travelling with a family friend rather than a tour guide. The kids have wonderful time and never feel bored at all with the historical buildings. The van that we travelled in was very comfortable, ice cool water and towels were provided making our whole trip even more comfortable. The driver, Mr. Peter is a nice guy that always greet us with a smile.Communicating with BKK Tours via email is an ease, payment can be made online, I highly recommended BKK Tours for any family that needs a tour around Bangkok.

We specifically asked to go to the less touristy floating market, which was only open on certain days of the month. Meeting time was 645 am (a really early start for young children!). So we were quite taken aback when the guide told us the driver would be half an hour late, as he had been told the wrong time by the company! It definitely wasn't a great start to our tour, but thankfully the van arrived 20 minutes later. So due to the late start, the tour itinerary was changed and we went straight to the train market instead of to the floating market. Lift, our guide, was warm and friendly and spoke excellent English. She held my little girl's hand when we visited the train market, pointing out interesting things to see. She even stopped at a corner and bought us the most delicious coconut cakes (warm, sweet and fragrant, a must-try and very very cheap!). The driver then drove us to another train station so that we could take the train and stand at the back to watch the market stalls unfolding their shades as the train passed through. It was really an interesting and eye-opening experience for the kids!The highlight of the tour was the visit to the brown sugar farm - we took a long tail boat (paddled by a very fit old man!) to see how coconut sugar was made from the nectar of coconut flowers. The kids even climbed up the tree to have a closer look at the flowers. They loved the coconut candy!Throughout, Lift was most obliging and kept plying us with food, snacks and drinks. I later found out that some of the extra food was meant for compensation for the late start to the tour - a kind gesture on their part! The van was comfortable and had a DVD player that kept my kids well-entertained in the Bangkok traffic congestion. Communication via email with the company was hassle-free and payment was easily done online.I had tried writing to Tours with Tong earlier, since they were rated no 1 on Tripadvisor, but no one got back to me. Sure Tours with Tong advised calling instead, but I didn't fancy paying international calling rates just to talk to them. So I decided to go with BKK tours instead, and am very glad it turned out so well. I would definitely recommend them without reservation!"

Michiel was prompt in his responses and no question went unanswered. We arrived after midnight with a tour of Ayuthaya scheduled for the next day. Air suggested leaving later in the AM and include a sunset visit to the reclining Bhudda in Ayuthaya. The fan was well equipped with the driver having cold towels for our face and necks upon each return to the van. In addition to the long tail boat ride, visit with the monks and a delicious river side restaurant lunch, it was a perfect start to our 5 days in Bangkok!Subsequent tours included Bangkok Highlights--an all day tour of the best of Bangkok temples and palace; China Town--unlike any other Chinatown tour, unclose and personal with many locals; and Authentic Markets (Tha Kha floating market--much smaller, not as touristy and far more personal, Damnoen Saduak floating market--very touristy but still fascinating) and then the afternoon Meet the Locals tour with Air.Air is so personable, intelligent, knowledgeable and has a great connection to so many in Bangkok. Her English is excellent, her humor welcome and personality warm. We loved our time with her and also meeting her husband, Michiel.We travel a good deal.

We had a terrific experience with our guide Air and her husband Michiel!!Michiel handled most of the online communication. He was quick to respond to all of our questions and provided thorough, comprehensive information.We spent 2 consecutive days with Air. We are all native English speakers and were very pleased with Air\u2019s excellent command of the language. Day One was a tour of Bangkok\u2019s Wats, Chinatown and Markets and the following day we explored Ayutthaya.Air was a perfect tour guide. In addition to having an encyclopedic knowledge of the places we visited, she showed us \u201coff the beaten track\u201d places that we would NEVER have seen on our own, and that we probably would not have seen with another, larger tour group. Air seemed to know a lot of the people we met during our two days on a personal level. She was very well received by people in the neighborhoods, Wat security people and even by some of the monks. This \u201cup close and personal\u201d orientation really helped to make our trip extra special!We asked to start our days early, and Air was happy to comply. On Day One, we were introduced to the inhabitants of some of Chinatown\u2019s neighborhoods, walked through the Flower Market, and tasted some awesome Thai coffee \u2013 all before 9:00AM!! We then explored the Wats \u2013 although we were there on a Saturday, Air managed to time our visits to the various Wats to pretty much avoid a lot of tourist traffic. In addition, she was able to provide us with some great photo opportunities (something that the photographer in our group really appreciated)!On Day Two we took a Long Boat to Ayutthaya. Prior to this, though, we went to a beautiful Wat where we were the only non-monks on campus! One of the most memorable parts of our trip was receiving a blessing from the head monk of this Wat. Again, Air seemed to know this man personally, which made this leg of our trip even more memorable.The trip to Ayutthaya was fabulous \u2013 the river scenery was just amazing! Once again, when we arrived at Ayutthaya, we were able to visit the Wats without the bother of a lot of tourist crowds \u2013 thank you Air, for working wonders with our schedule!Lunches both days were out of this world! We were expecting a bag lunch or maybe a buffet at some tourist restaurant, but Air brought us to two restaurants that were mostly patronized by locals, and the food was fantastic!!We will definitely be visiting Bangkok again, and our first email will be to BKK Tours. We know Air and Michiel will help us to craft a tour schedule to give us yet another perspective on this beautiful, complex, diverse and welcoming city.We would highly recommend BKK Tours to anyone wanting to get to know Bangkok and the environs!"

Unlike other Asian cities like, say, Hong Kong where English is very widely spoken and you can get around pretty much on your own, Bangkok is simply too complex, too diverse and too exotic for anyone but the most intrepid travelers to navigate on their own. We never take pre-packaged group tours, so we looked into hiring a private local tour guide. There are many to choose from but after much research, fortunately we selected BKK Tours. We couldn\u2019t have made a better choice.Michiel and Air, owners of BKK Tours, are not only top-notch guides, they are also consummate professionals. From start to finish, BKK made everything easy. They return emails and answer questions promptly and effectively. We spent three of our four days with BKK, having chosen the tours we desired from among many options. Even when our flight from Chicago to Bangkok had some unforeseeable delays causing us to arrive a day later than planned, BKK was able to accommodate the schedule change without a problem.Our selections were the Bangkok Highlights Luxury, Authentic Markets of Thailand and Authentic Ayutthaya. These are three must-see components of any trip to Bangkok. It\u2019s not just the sights and sounds and aromas that made each day so special, it was the way we were cared for along the way. Excellent luxury touring vans, special amenities, first-class food and deep insights into the history, culture and people of Thailand. I should also point out that no two trips are alike and BKK Tours was extremely accommodating to customizing our packages based on special interests or needs we had.Lastly, I am an avid photography enthusiast. One option BKK offers is to have Michiel join you as a photography guide, which we opted for. Michiel is not only a top-tier photographer in his own right, but he was also able to give me some tips, teach me some tricks and take me to some hidden places to help make my images really stand out from the run-of-the mill vacation snapshots. I\u2019ve included a few in this review. I can\u2019t overstate how much we enjoyed our stay in Bangkok, and how fortunate we feel to have selected BKK Tours as our guide."

We made arrangements for a group of 8 to be picked up for a one day tour from the cruise port. Our tour guide Chao and driver Dan provided excellent service from 8am in the morning until they returned us to the port at 7pm. The transport was the most luxurious van I've ever seen and very comfortable. Our guide was helpful, informative, open to accommodate our requests whenever he possibly could and lots of fun. The tour included everything - lunch, cold drinks throughout, cold towels when we returned to the van from the heat. Chao even purchased bread for us to feed the catfish in the river. I could not fault anything about the service we received from BKK."

However Nadia deserves a very special mention. She was just awesome amazing out of the world tour guide. She is very knowledgeable, very communicative and adjusts well with the mood of audience. On day 1, we went for Highlights of Bangkok tour. She explained in great deal about Budhism, Ramayan and all history. She talked about everything ranging from religion, history and politics for good time while we were commuting. Overall this gave me a crash course on Thai culture. Our family is vegetarian, the food she ordered was very tasty. Day 2, we went to Erawan fall. The scenery was amazing and so were both the guides. Our kids got mixed with Nadia very much. Even after returning back, they were talking about her. One of the things I typically hate about all inclusive tours is typically they come in riders and waivers with lot of terms and conditions. This was indeed an all inclusive tour with no cost cutting anywhere. They have unlimited supplies of drinks, food, snacks, towels, anything you name it. This tour and guide were not just the professionals. They have the human touch and that's what make them very special. Thank you ladies for making this trip memorable."

Some times with these kind of expectations we tend to get disappointed even with small issue but we were not, a great company, without any fuss they pre-poned my trip couple of hours. Mrs Air took us through Palace, Temple of Reclining Buddha, Canal Tour while giving us all the relevant information that a tourist like us needs (we were a family of four, with the youngest being 3 year who was throwing tantrums every now and then as any typical three year old on a sunny sweaty day). Mrs Air answered all the questions with calm and ever present smile. We avoided the traffic by taking train, boat, Tuk Tuk etc. I felt its tad bit expensive as the mode of transportation was public, but then the trip and Mrs Air personal care definitely made up for that. Will definitely recommend them."

I used this service primarily because they had very good reviews on Trip Advisor and they were able to provide a tour for me despite being a solo traveler. Many other companies I researched required 2 or more travelers. I did the Half Day Bangkok Highlight Tour on August 28, 2013. Ms. Air was my guide. She was an excellent tour guide: friendly, punctual, professional, and very knowlegable. The tour lasted about 4 1/2 to 5 hours: 8a-1p. The tour consisted of everything that was promised: canal tour, use of various modes of transportation in Bangkok, tour of the Grand Palace (my favorite part) and Emerald Buddha. Ms. Air was kind enough to take pictures for me at various points at the Grand Palace. I would have done the full day tour but my flight the day before did not arrive until close to midnight so I was still somewhat fatigued. All in all, I highly recommend BKK Tours if traveling to Thailand.Thanks,Wabu Susberry"

We had wanted Air after hearing many excellent reviews about her, but she was not available that day - 30 August 2013. It turned out that Miss Oi is also very good, very attentive, and professional, and knowledgeable in her job. Our tour consisted of a trip to train station market, floating market, Kanachanburi war museum, cemetary and bridge over River Kwai. We had lunch in Cabbage & Condoms which serves good Thai food in a serene quiet ambience. At the floating market, Miss Oi arranged for a smaller boat (& not the motorized type which we felt was noisy) so we could go to the smaller canal to see the living condition of people residing there. We appreciate her thoughtfulness to bring us to less touristic route of the floating market. We like the serene and quietness of this route.Miss Oi and driver were very patient & helpful along the way. One of my girlfriends had diarrhoea and kept going to toilets. At Cabbage & Condoms, my friend Mary decided to just get a cab and head back to our hotel in Sukhumvit Soi 11 which is about 2.5 hours drive away, as she didn't think she could last till end of the tour at 6pm+. Miss Oi help her to call for a cab and leave instructions with the restaurant supervisor before we left for the 2nd half our tour. And yes, the van was very very comfortable. A pretty new van, clean and comfortable chairs.If we ever need to go for another package tour in Bangkok, we will certainly look for BKK Tours, though the price was alittle steep.Highly recommended tour agency."

We had a short time in Bangkok and wanted to make the most of it so we arranged for one of the BKK guides, a lovely woman named Oi, to pick us up at the airport. Oi took us to our hotel so we could check in and then we were off sight seeing right away. We had a full day visiting many sites using local transportation (great way to get to know your way around the city a little) and a wonderful lunch river side where we had a terrific array of Thai food. The second day Oi took us to the railroad and floating markets outside of Bangkok. Again, we had a great time. Oi was very friendly, informative, and extremely responsive to our interests and needs. In addition, BKK Tours was great to work with - very quick replies with exactly the info we needed. Our tours were excellent value for the price and we can't say enough about how wonderful Oi was."

This is the second year using BKK Tours with Air as my guide.As I had decided to stay in Bangkok for a week this year I booked a total of four and half day tours, including an overnight stay at Kanchanaburi, on an all inclusive basis.- Bangkok Temples (one day)- Bangkok Chinatown (half day)- Kanchanaburi (two days)- Bangkok - Prasart Museum & Jim Thompson House (one day)From initial enquiry I found the service provided was excellent with Air providing detailed advice on itinerary and hotels in both Bangkok and Kanchanaburi. She was also flexible with timings and able to adapt to events. Timings - at Kanchanaburi I decided I wanted to spend more time at Hellfire Pass and the Commonwealth War Graves Cemeteries so Air reduced the time spent at Erawan waterfalls.Adaptability - when heavy rain and protestors brought Bangkok traffic to standstill Air got me back to my hotel using canal boats and a motorcycle taxi. Air's local knowledge was invaluable and allowed me to see a side of Bangkok that many tourists simply do not experience. The Chinatown visit and Prassart Museum are two places I would not have visited on my own.Overall I highly recommend BKK Tours - they are not the cheapest tour company but the service offered is exemplary."

We were in Bangkok for the beginning of our honeymoon and chose to do the half-day tour to Maeklong market followed by a tour of the Tha Kha floating market. The Maeklong market is not to be missed. The array of foods for sale is nothing short of astounding and the train passing through is INCREDIBLE. Ms. Oi was wonderful, she had a wealth of knowledge on every single topic that we asked a question about and bought us a variety of tasty snacks and beverages.The Tha Kha market is also a truly unique experience. We saw almost no other tourists, just lovely Thai women in boats, making delicious food and chatting with each other about the weeks events. We took a boat ride along the river to an old family house, where a sister and brother have been processing palm sugar the old-fashioned way for years (and their family had been doing it for centuries!!!). This was an authentic glimpse into a traditional Thai way of life and the experience was truly invaluable. We will never forget it.Booking was very easy (via e-mail) and professional - the owners communicated in very good english and were highly professional - no down payment necessary, just pay when your tour is done. Ms. Oi was excellent. She spoke English very well and shared a wide variety of interesting facts/tidbits as we were driving around. The transportation too was of high quality. We had a an air-conditioned passenger van just for the two of us! The driver was very friendly and was ready to pick us up at our various destinations.ENTHUSIASTICALLY recommended. Do not hesitate to book with BKK. Amid the hustle and bustle and Bangkok it is invaluable to have a friendly, and knowledgeable tour guide. It was worth every penny and only wish we could have used them for all of our excursions in Bangkok."

Very, very comfortable van and plenty of cold drinks on hand - like travelling first class! Air is so knowledgeable and speaks perfect English, we learnt so much about Thai culture...we tried foods we would never normally try, we walked down little laneways we would normally be too scared to walk down. These memories will last a lifetime! We are not the type to go on group tours however we have a tendency to feel overwhelmed in big cities so arranging a private tour was a perfect introduction to Bankgok. A private tour may cost a bit more but is absolutely worth every cent as you can go at your own pace and it's easily customised. Air gave us so many tips on how to get around and things to do and see and this gave us the confidence to get out and explore this amazing city. We are already planning a return trip to Bangkok in May 2014 and will definitely book a tour with BKK Tours again - just need to decide which one! Thank you Air!"

No matter what the request, Oi went out of her way to meet our needs. On our first day arriving in Bangkok Oi arrived at our hotel right on time, waited for us to get settled in, and then started our tour. She took us to Wat Pho, the Grand Palace, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, and a tour of the canal. Although you could see these things without a tour guide it wouldn't be as worth while. As a teacher I loved having a personal history lesson all day long. There was no question that went unanswered. I learned all about the different poses of the Buddha and their meanings, how to tell what region each Buddha is from, countless traditions and rituals of the Thai people, and got to sample many local ways of transportation. While with Oi, I truly felt like a Thai and I felt we experienced not only the grand, common tourist places, but those sites often missed as well. Oi even took us to a store and set us up with a local phone. Oi is one of the friendliest and most interesting people I have ever met. You can tell she loves her job. On the second day of our tours we went to the Makasan slum, a local school, the Golden Mount, the Golden Buddha, and had a visit to Chinatown. The nice thing about BKK Tours was the willingness to change any predetermined schedule to fit your interests. I really wanted to see a lot of local life and I definitely got that chance. We are on a seven week journey through Southeast Asia and so far I have not met any tour guide more knowledgeable, friendly, or helpful than Oi. She truly makes the experience of Bangkok unforgettable."

BKK Tours in BangkokMy wife and I were recently in Bangkok for 3 days and wanted a tour guide who could show us the traditional sites, the local culture and how everyday life is experienced. I spent much time searching the internet for the best tour guide and easily decided upon BKK Tours. From the very first contact it became obvious that this was the company that would serve our interests the best. We communicated with Michiel and Air, a husband and wife team that demonstrated the utmost professionalism at every level of service. Some of the things that we wanted to see and do were probably considered off the beaten path, but Air made them happen joyfully and with ease. Her English is perfect.On our first day she picked us up in a Tuk Tuk and we could not imagine a better way to start a 3 day tour. After that we were transported by car, driven by Tommy, who too was a true professional in every sense and happens to also be a great guy.Day 2 and day 3 were equally abundant with things to do and see and Air made sure that all of our expectations and priorities were met with a cheerful and wanting to please attitude. The temples and palaces are something that everyone should see at least once, however, if your interests are more varied Air will ensure that all of your wishes reach fruition. We particularly enjoyed the railroad market, flower market, and best of all the floating market. For true adventurers be sure and walk the slums and yes it\u2019s just like the movie. A fascinating look at how happiness can prevail even in abject poverty.We can\u2019t say whether BKK Tours offers the best guide in Bangkok, but I would bet that anyone else could only be as good at best.Thanks again Air for helping to make our stay in Bangkok a truly memorable event. We still think about you and what a wonderful experience you brought to us.Best Regards,Ron and Cindy"

However the night before I came down with a dose of Bangkok belly. I called Michiel an hour before pick up a little concerned especially after reading a previous complaining review on Tripadvisor. He immediately allayed any fears and asked if we wanted to try to do it another day if we had time. I hoped that I would be better the day after and we booked accordingly. I asked if my wife could join the guide for a half day shopping/market tour. Obviously more enjoyable than hanging around the hotel, looking after a sick husband. She had a great time with her guide, Air and arrived back to the hotel all smiles.Look, I could go on about how good our one day tour was but plenty of people have done that already.

On arrival in Bangkok we went for lunch at a restaurant in a Yacht Club right on the river. Air ordered for us, taking care to ensure my food allergies and my husband's eating restrictions were accommodated, and we had a very delicious meal of Morning Glory (sauteed vegetable), Grilled Fish with Pineapple and Vegetables, and white rice for us, and Thai Fried Rice with Pork \"old style\" for my husband. He still dreams about that fried rice...We then went on to the Grand Palace, then took a fun tuk-tuk ride to Wat Pho and the Temple of the Reclining Buddha.

In the afternoon we went to the Prasart Museum on the outskirts of Bangkok, where we had the 6 acres of grounds, buildings and gardens to ourselves! The tour was very in depth and interesting! At the end of our museum tour Air and the driver took us back to the ship without incident.Throughout the entire two days Air was careful about our comfort, with cold bottled water and cold towels available regularly. And even with our resrictive food needs we did not experience any issues or discomfort at all from the restaurant and food choices. We would highly recommend BKK Tours for anyone traveling to Bangkok. Michiel and Air are true professionals who genuinely care about their customers."

I found BKK Tours very flexible and prompt in answering our communications. We went for a customised tour of Makkasan Slums, Wat Ratchanada (Metal castle), Amulet markets and Ban Bat (monk bowl village). We really enjoyed the train ride and exploring the 'slum' area and seeing the local train station. I think we were too early for the Monk Bowl village as there wasn't really much happening and to be honest, as much as we liked our guide Ms Gift, I don't think she knew anything about the Bowl Village or the 21 step process to making a bowl. As a guide, I would have expected her to have checked this out prior. Loved Wat Ratchanada and will definitely return there to do the walking meditation"

Chau our guide and Peter the driver were waiting in the lobby as promised on time. The Van was super modern and very comfortable and we quickly made our way through the holiday traffic to our first stop the Buddah Temple a great experience and very authentic. Then onto a boat ride up river to the Chinese Temple again a great cultural experience. Lunch was included and we let Chau choose our meal the green curry was a bit too much for me as i was still hungover from the night before.Then a tour around the ruins great history.We decided to book the Train Market and Floating Market both must sees in our opinion.Finally Today we have been to the kwai Experience. I thought the kwai was a little touristy If you want to see the bridge in the movie go to Sri Lanka however the visits to the CWGC Cemetery s were a moving experience and i would recommend you visit and take time to show respect. and Chau and Peter gave us time to visit both cemeterys in the region.The tour started with a visit to Hellfire Pass a must visit i wish now that we had booked more time to visit this moving place. You walk the tracks of where thousands of Dutch Australian and British and Asians lost their lives building the railway to Burma. you can feel the energy and sadness as you walk through the cutting. Lunch followed brilliant lots of Thai dishes to try and the location was magnificent.A boat ride like the James bond movie was included and a visit to a monks museum. Overall i would say that we felt safe comfortable but most of all we gained two friends in Chau and Peter at each stop we were given hand wipes and fresh water great in this heat. lots of local snacks local fruit and coffees were on hand and most importantly our guide spoke good english and understood my northern dialect. We spent time in India and our guide although a lovely chap couldnt speak english and as a result we lost out on local sights on our trip due to poor communication. This was never a problem with Chau. Overall i would highly recommend a trip with BKK. Although on first glance BKK might appear more expensive to other tour groups, But BKK give a personal touch, quality, and a high standard of customer service. thanks Guys"

Prior to the tour they quickly and politely answered all my questions. Whilst the tour may seem expensive it is a private tour and all meals, drinks, snacks, entry fees and even coffee are paid for. The extra expense to avoid being hustled into a souvenir shop and encouraged to purchase is worth it, in my opinion!Our guide, Ms Oi, was perfect. She was very good at judging our needs and allowing us to move at our own pace.

He was not only a great guide, but also a great person to be around. He gave us insights that we probably would not get on larger group tours. You know the kind, with someone holding a funny looking flag in the air with 15 people following them around. We got a true taste of what it was like to be in Bangkok. The tours were very laid back and were at our own pace. If we wanted to spend extra time at a location or leave early, it was not a problem. That is something that is important to me. As a photographer I don't want to leave until I have my shot. And I like to explore at a leisurely pace. My GF got sick one day and we had to reschedule a tour from Wednesday to Friday and it was not a problem. The company even recommended a very nice local hospital for us to go to. We were both saddened to hear that our guide (M as we called him) was in an accident. But I strongly recommend that when he is better that you request him. He could not have been any better. Thanks to him and BKK tours, we saw things that we would not have seen on our own. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I just wanted everyone one to know how great my experience was with this company."

It was as others have said, not the cheapest of tours but we could not fault the fact we got excellent value for money and absolutely everything was looked after for us without the dreaded need to bargain and barter prices.Our first day was to Ayutthaya and it was a lovely introduction to temples and early Thai history.Our guide (Ms) Nutty was wonderful, over exuberant and over chatty till she settled down and took a chill pill and worked out our needs, then she was just great.We were picked up in an amazingly comfortable van which could have easily catered to another half a dozen people and driven around in style all day. It felt like sitting in an armchair with a birds eye view. Plied with cold, cold water and face towels at every turn.What's not to like?Really had no idea how Ayutthaya was all set out but I think we saw it from every single angle.From the river, by boat and from this style temple to that with the most amazing lunch right on the rivers edge. Probably the best meal we had in Thailand in certainly one of the best spots.We had a day off in between, for the recommended local Wats, then spent our last day doing all the different markets, again with Nutty. What a day!! Loving food as I do it was really amazing.Cannot even remember the names of all the markets.First up was the train market. Unbelievable!Then a lovely quiet, seemed like a local floating market in a coconut plantation, where we also had a boat ride to a coconut sugar processing place run by the same lady for ever.They even stopped for us to feed and see the elephants we had seen on the way there.Then the very touristy market, which was great for photos but walked on further and across a bridge to the local market which was much more about where people live now.We stopped for a beer and met some really interesting people here.I think our last market was another popular spot for locals to go out for a lovely seafood lunch and its just amazing to watch the way cooking is done on a tiny little wooden boat without room to turn around.We finished up all having an excellent foot massage at this market...so needed that!Nutty had managed to feed us up all day on tasty little morsels from all the places we had visited so she used our lunch money to purchase a yummy early dinner before putting us on our train to Chiang Mai in the evening. What great service!We were very impressed and fully recommend BKK tours and would seek them out again if ever we get back to Bangkok.Thanks Nutty!!"

Michiel and Air worked with me from the very beginning to set things up. And that was very helpful. For example, in the beginning, they advised me to save some money by catching a longtail from Sathorn Pier to see the canals by myself. But since I chose not to include the railway market in the Tha Kha tour, Michiel and Air came up with the idea that the canal tour could be appended to the Chinatown tour because having a guide along would be helpful. BKK Tours try to differentiate themselves from their competitors by leveraging their detailed knowledge of Bangkok and the surrounding area. For example, most tour operators go to Damnoen Saduak, which essentially kills the place. It is overrun by tourists and their buses and boats by 9AM. Tha Kha is harder to get to and in fact, I learned about it from BKK's website. There was no mention of it in the Rough Guide for Bangkok.A few words about my guide, Miss Oi. Yes, she is knowledgeable, courteous, punctual, etc... But I was most impressed by how early on, she correctly guessed my preferences and subtly tailored the tours accordingly to suit my tastes. People skills are what you need to be a good tour guide. I think Miss Air has enough of them to be a great tour guide.As others have noted in their reviews, BKK pricing is not cheap. But I'm a firm believer in \"you get what you pay for\". I was not disappointed. In fact, the quality of the service far surpassed my expectation. So if you want to splurge, not in terms of fancy dining and shopping, but in an interesting and thought-provoking experience, BKK tours is for you."

I did feel a little odd at first being one person with two guides and a driver, but I'm really glad I had two guides at the railway market, where Michiel gave me hints on how to photograph the train as it was passing through the market RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, whilst Tek captured it all on video for me.I booked about a month in advance via email, so BKK was able to advise me when the less touristy floating market was open, I'm really glad I visited that one, it was so charming. We also visited a farm where cane sugar is produced, which was fascinating.This tour is very expensive by Southeast Asian standards, but I think it's worth it, particularly as I've paid this much for group tours in Europe! The railway/floating market is particularly worthwhile as (according to lonely planet) getting to the railway market on your own is very complicated!"

We booked a one day Photo Tour with Michiel and Ms. Oi. Having Michiel come along was well worth the extra $$ to have his extremely helpful tips and experience. He assessed my level (which is maybe \"moderately experienced amateur\") and was able to come up with many helpful tips that I would not have gleaned from a classroom experience. Plus, he knows where the good places are to shoot, and tailors the tour experience for that purpose. He was a patient, kind and effective teacher. Meanwhile, Ms. Oi was giving my husband lots of personal attention, focussing on more facts and information, so that he was also getting a great tour experience. She was very knowledgeable and of course, being Thai, had insights (and the language!) that complemented Michiel's photo knowledge base very well, making this the perfect experience for us as a couple. Also, the minivan truly was luxurious and the lunch we had was quite fantastic! Let them choose for you! In terms of specifics, we went to the market through which the train runs (fantastic!), then on to a floating market (also fantastic!) and a coconut farm (will never forget it!), then lunch, then back to Bangkok where we went to Chinatown (markets etc.), a temple, and to the Buddha factories (the latter wasn't my favourite thing, but depends on your tastes). It was a good spot to practice some panning shots of Tuk tuks though! Wish we'd had time to do the slums with Michiel... maybe next time! After we finished our tour, Michiel sent me a lovely email summarizing a whole bunch of suggestions and teachings (truly a wonderful touch!), as well as some of his own photos from the day.

We toured much of Bangkok Highlighs with BKK. The guides were personable and extremely informative. They even customized our tour plan so that we did not duplicate anything that we had already seen as part of the large group tour. It was much better to see the sites at our own pace and to have such great interaction with the guides. We also did the railway market, floating market, flower market and Chinatown tours. Both days we had great lunches at great restaurants (all included in the tour cost). BKK was an easy company with which to do business.

            "review": "Professional and responsible BKK answer to our prayers. After trying several times - unsuccessfully - to get a confirmation from the No. 1 Trip Advisor rated tour company, I scrolled down and found BKK. Thank heavens! Air, who runs the tour company with her Dutch husband, sent back detailed emails, adding things we wanted to do and setting everything up, specific prices, schedule etc. While BKK may seem more expensive, one of the great aspects of our two days with Air is that we paid for almost nothing (except the massage mentioned below) until the end. At the Railway Market and floating lunar market outside Bangkok - both fascinating - she constantly was buying us coffee and food samples. Lunch in local restaurants is included in BKK tours, and you can order what you want or she will do it for you. She handled admissions tickets to the attractions in Bangkok. I mentioned I'd like to try a massage at Wat Pho (Reclining Buddha), so she scheduled our tour in the morning when we didn't need to wait for a massage - it was 540 Baht ($18) for an hour (plus tip, which was obviously appreciated)...great! Loved the hour-long river tour in the private boat that looks like an oversized gondola. I have some issues with bad knees, so instead of going by public transportation in Bangkok, she arranged for a van - and still managed to hire a tuk tuk for a short ride. We never would have managed to do all we did on our own, nor would we have known how to navigate in Bangkok and its environs. She took us to places we never would have found on our own. Was a wonderful introduction to Bangkok!"

We went on a day tour of the city w/ my family of 4 and my parents, group of 6. From a 9yr old to a 78yr old! I was afraid if my handicapped father could keep up w/ the tour, but Air took care of him very well, it was almost like he was having the MOST fun at all times.When my father SUDDENLY suggested he wanted buy some flowers, Air went all around the shops at the flower market and found him fresh Thai flowers that lasted the longest. Chose a nice box (to store) for him too. and when he SUDDENLY said he wanted vegitable (coriander)seeds, she went looking around for a seed shop for us, and got to buy exactly what he wanted. On the way back from the day tour, again, my father asked Air if she could find a Chinese medicine shop for him, and she found him the exact one he wanted! It was amazing because he had been searching for this traditional Chinese medicine for a long time, and FINALLY, found it thanks to Air! Sorry, Air for all that trouble!!!!I could go on and on for what she had done for us, but there is soooo much we want to thank her for, just can't fit in one page.What I liked about Air, she took care of us like we were her family. She ate w/us, and we were very happy about that too. We got to hear about her life in Thailand, about herself, made us feel comfortable.BTW, the van is very stylish and comfortable! I am so glad we booked for the van! We got to avoid the sun at all times, and this really helped my father and the kids. It's not cheap, but if you are travelling in a group, it's very convenient! It was nice knowing you, Air. My parents, they met in Thailand 40yrs ago (on a business trip), became a nice 2nd honeymoon for them too!

We had only one full day in Bangkok with our two kids (age 10 and 12) and were interested in not only seeing the sights but in getting some sort of insider view of the city. We got exactly that with BKK Tours and Mr. Michai. Everything went smoothly in terms of scheduling the tour, meeting Mr. \"M\", cost, etc (everything is included, we did not pay for one thing the whole day beyond the tour cost). We enjoyed Wat Pho and the Grand Palace and Mr. M was very knowledgable and gave the appropriate amount of information for our group - he also was happy and able to answer many, many questions we had about the sights but also life in Bangkok, questions about what we were observing, etc. He added a stop to a very \"locals\" market as we wanted to see that and pointed out all the different foods and navigated us through the market and to a lesser known wat nearby. There were many instances where we really felt we were seeing things we never would have found on our own such as a restaurant (right next to the Grand Palace) that was in a naval facility and there was not one other tourist in sight - nothing fancy, but the food was delicious and it was right on the river. We also enjoyed our tea stop at a \"hip\" coffee house with local art for sale on the walls and delicious drinks. He also included transport on the oldest transportation mode in Bangkok which was the canal taxi - not the tourist one on the big river, but the one real workers use to get around Bangkok. We really felt we got as much out of our time as possible. And Mr. M was great with my shy kids - gently joking with them and addressing them directly to keep them engaged. Our tour also included the flower market, a long tail boat ride down the river, fish feeding and more."

She picked us up promptly at our hotel and showed us the highlights of Bangkok, including the Grand Palace, the Reclining Buddha, a local food and flower market, and a tour of the canals by longboat. Gift was easy to talk to, very personable and shared a lot of interesting information about each site we visited and the history of Thailand. We both felt like we learned a lot of information that we would not have gotten if we'd chosen to see each site on our own. In addition, Gift made sure to take photos of us at each site and we didn't even have to ask, which was great! Everything was covered by the tour cost, which we were able to pay online via paypal before our trip, and it was nice to not have to worry about paying for anything throughout the day. Michiel and Air also did a great job of emailing me back promptly and even suggested some sites that we could see on our own. I definitely recommend taking a tour with BKK and Gift, especially if you have a limited amount of time in Bangkok and want to see as much as possible."

Booking on the internet and wondering what to expect was the biggest worry. But we were met at our hotel by Ms Oi and our driver. Very friendly and helpful. We took in the train market, the less touristy floating market and ended up at the Bridge Over The River Kwai. Throughout the day our guides made sure we were looked after and allowed us to do as we wanted. All the activities that they had planned for us were outstanding. The highlight being the long tail speed ride on the River Kwai. The transportation was outstanding and we never had to worry about anything. Even when barganing with the locals Ms Oi assisted us in making sure we were not ripped off. All in all it was a fantastic day, mad so by BKK tours."

We chose to visit the Train Market, an authentic floating market, the Burma Railway Museum and the Bridge Over The River Kwai. Unlike another well known travel company in Bangkok BKK came back with a price that covered everything including tolls, entrance fees and meals etc, this was great as we were on a budget and didn't want any hidden costs. Aire was fantastic, she is so knowledgeable of all the places we went and there were many extras included in our tour that we hadn't expected - like fruit bought for us at the train market, and visit to a coconut sugar farm, also the meal we had at lunch was the best meal we had in all our time in Bangkok. Our tour took 12 hours and was excellent value for money, we are planning the return to Bangkok and will be sure to contact Michil and Aire again. Thank you for a great day"

I researched on the Thailand Tourism website for a reputable tour company to show us around Thailand. I found 5 tour companies and one of them is BKK Tours. All fives have reviewed on tripadvisor. Initially, I emailed another companies and got a reply from them. Prior to leaving, I made arrangements for a private tour guide with Michiel & Air, based largely on their positive Trip Advisor reviews. Michiel was always responsive to email and proved to be fully reliable.We did 2 tours (Bangkok Highlights and Railway and floating market (Half day tour). Our guide was Gift for both days. She was sweet, and personable!! On the first day tour, we went to the Maeklong Railway market, which is held on the railway track. When a train is coming, vendors start pushing their tables to the side and the minute the train is gone, everything returns to the initial state. Throughout the tour, snacks and refreshments were provided, as well as cold towels. We visited the Royal Grand Palace, temple of the reclining Buddha (What Pho) and the emerald Buddha (What Phra). Gift was very knowledgeable about Thai history and culture, so I spent a great and instructive day with her. She can adjust to go through some attractions faster than others and was great on-the-fly (I changed what I wanted to do last minute several times). Next day, we had a canal tour on the Klongs, where you can see picturesque scenes of life by the river. We visited the Arun Wat and Jim Thompson House. I also appreciated all the times Gift grabbed my camera and took some beautiful family photos for us as generally I am always stuck behind the camera.I really recommend these people, I've done a lot of tours all around the world but have never met such kind and professional guide.\u2022"

Please don't hesitate in booking a tour with BKK and if you get the fabulous Oi as your guide you will have a very informative day. We opted for the bangkok highlights tour which if you have never been to the city before is perfect. It combines a mixture of more traditional sightseeing to a couple of the temples with a true insight into how the Thai people work and live. You travel using different modes of transport including a tuk-tuk, tailboat, sky train and metro. It gave us the confidence and knowledge to use them throughout our stay in bangkok. I would do this tour on one of your first days in bangkok and get out early (as they recommend) to experience the city getting to work. Our guide spoke great English and was extremely knowledgeable about the city. We could ask her anything (and did)! She also recommended places to go in the evening and what else we should do during our trip.This tour is a bit more expensive than some of the others on offer but is all inclusive of food, entry fees, transport costs, drinks etc which takes the worry out of things and means you don't need to be worrying about paying for things. I would also be good for a lone traveller. Highly recommended!! Thank you so much Oi."

However, BKK Tour responded to all my emails very quickly and with loads of valuable information. Their emails response are never slipshod and always filled with information. This definitely help me to plan my tour and the places that I want to go to for the tour. I think I have sent a total of 30 emails to them but they are always very patient! Really appreciated it a lot!On our arrival, I was really afraid that they will forget about our tour as I booked quite early. However, this was not needed. Our guide, Oi reached the hotel promptly before 7am. Though my sister's friends arrive a little late, Oi waited patiently for all of us to arrive at the hotel lobby. Then we proceeded to Maeklong Railway Market! The van ride is about 1hr from our hotel @ Pratunam.After our arrival at Maeklong Railway Market, Oi showed us around the market and all the local foods. It was an eye-opener when the train passes by! Oi also helped us to take wonderful pictures on the railway! Then we had a great train ride to another station which the van is already waiting for us to bring us to Tha Kha Floating Market.Tha Kha Floating Market is a local market which opens on weekends and on special weekdays depending on the phase of the moon. We only see another group of tourists from BKK too. It was really an authentic floating market! We went to visit a sugar plantation (which is really awesome!). We also got to eat some of the snacks available. As my sister and her friend are afraid of dogs, Oi is really nice, she assists to get the dogs away from them. She is really friendly and helpful!Although BKK tour is a little pricey, I will engage them again and refer my friends too due the personalised tour that they provide and their responsive emails!"

I booked the full day Bangkok Highlights tour and the Authentic Ayutthaya tour. Air was my guide both days and I had a phenomenal time! It was such an incredible experience to have a one on one local guide show me around her Thailand. Air was great, she met me at my hotel in the morning and took care of every possible detail. All I had to do was follow, look, listen and eat! We traveled via tuk tuk, sky train, long tail boat in Bangkok, exploring the amazing Wat Pho and Grand Palace. We walked around the produce and flower markets and then took a long tail boat tour of the canal. Along the way we sampled food from various street vendors and stopped for a great lunch. At the end of the day she brought me back to my hotel and recommended a nearby place for dinner.The next morning she picked me up in a comfortable van for the trip to Ayutthaya. The van was stocked with water and cold wet clothes (it was super hot out!). We explored the amazing ruins of Ayutthaya, cruised the river on a long tail boat and visited a non-profit Elephant reserve and fed the elephants. We also ate another amazing lunch where I tried things I never would have if on my own.A great thing about both days what that we traveled at our own pace, without having to worry about sticking with a big tour group and rushing to get back on a bus to the next destination.And, since I had to check out of the hotel the morning of the Ayutthaya tour, we brought my luggage in the van and she dropped me off at the airport at the end of the day!Thank you Air!! If I'm ever lucky enough to find myself back in Thailand, I'll be booking another tour with BKK."

We felt like we had seen the very best of this busy city and were amazed that we had the peace and serenity of the local countryside as well. Of course we had the amazing miss April as our very efficient and delightful guide and her knowledge and English were outstanding and the sweetest, kindest and funniest companion that we could have asked for. We had the tour guide to ourselves and were treated as the the most important people in Thailand that weekend ( apart from their beloved king and queen of course)! Highly recommend this tour company and their amazing team. Bangkok is a city quite unlike any other!"

After reading all the positive reviews in TripAdvisor, our expectations were raised. Despite the already high expectations, I'm very happy to say that the tour STILL managed to surpass our expectations!We enjoyed ourselves on the 1/2 day tour - in fact it was the highlight of our holiday in Bangkok. The Tha Ka market, which has \"original openings\" on only a few days a month based on the lunar calendar, must have been as authentic as authentic gets. This was the real deal. Apart from ~1-2 other small groups, we were practically the only tourists there to experience the charm of the local market & its friendly people. No tourist souvenirs of any sort, just the freshest of vegetables & fruits sold by old ladies in long tail boats. We also had one of our best meals (boat noodles, skewered meat, some sort of omelette, fried bananas) in Bangkok, prepared straight from the boats... simple but very satisfying!The Maeklong railway market and the leisurely boat ride to visit a coconut sugar farm, run by an elderly aunty was just as interesting. We were shown the whole process of collecting the \"coconut flower sap\", the boiling and the stirring... & to top it off, we also got to sample some delicious coconut sugar.Ms Gift was an excellent guide. She was VERY polite & respectful & connected well with people i.e. with us as well as with the local people. She had interesting stories to tell & made us feel like we had known each other for a long time! The whole tour was relaxing with enough time to snap pictures and take in all the wonderful sights. Really, what more could we ask for? If we do return to Bangkok one day, we would definitely look for Ms Gift again!"

She is knowledgeable and is eager to show you her country and all that is has to offer.The weather was very hot and humid during our trip but AIre made sure we had water to drink and found shade so we could take a rest when needed. Her driver was very good and his van was comfortable and air conditioned. Two of the individuals in our party had difficulty walking so Aire. Again she was very helpful and accomodating by making sure that they were able to keep up with her. I would highly recommend BKK Tours and hope to get back to Bangkok for a more extensive tour of Thailand with Aire. We especially enjoyed our Long Boat tour of the canals and our stop at a small local temple. We met a Monk who blessed a beautiful little Buddha that we purchased. The canal tour allowed us to see children at play in the canals as well as observe the living conditions of the thousands of people who live in the houses along the canals.Bangkok is amazing, you will see luxury hotels next to seedy night markets. You can trust Aire to make sure that you enjoy a safe but wonderful tour of her fascintaing country."

Railway market was amazing and I would say highlight of the tour. My husband and I were left in awe to see how people moved their shops when the train came and within seconds the train had left, the business went on as usual. We totally loved it. Too bad that the Kha floating market was not open so we settled with the other one which turned into tourist market. (Air has already informed us before we booked the tour) Thank you, Air for those noodle soups. Dave is still talking about it. And we both love a boat ride in the canal and seeing how people's daily lives in those area. We will be back with some northern Thailand tour ;)"

            "review": "1/2 Day Floating Markets.next day 1/2 day Chinatown tour.. I was met by Oi my guide at my hotel in Chinatown and we drove of in really lovely van to firstly go to Maeklong markets. These markets are done on a railway line that is used 4 times a day by a train that terminates at Maeklong Station then 15 minutes later returns back to Bangkok. I was amazed by how everything was moved out of the way of the train. Then put it all back out again while the train terminates at the station. I got some great photos with the train just about touching my face as it went by. We then walked back to the van and then drove on to the Tha Kha markets, These markets are held on weekends but there are also specials ones held on week days with dates that revolve around phases of the moon. As this was a week day it was all the more special as there was only one other tourist there when we arrived. These markets are for the locals and are truly authentic. I had a great time taking photos of all the locals trading from their boats along the canals.Later we went for a paddle in one of the boats which took us to a palm sugar plantation. To me this was the highlight of the day. The lovely lady there had put some cut bananas into one of the vats that the palm sugar was being extracted from. A sweet treat later just for us. We had lunch back at the markets from one of the boats selling food. It was a great morning and I would really recommend this tour, the food and the boat trip.The next day we started later in the morning and went on a walking tour of Chinatown. I had already had a bit of a look around the afternoon before. However this tour was going to take me up a maze of narrow alleyways and lanes. I met a lot of locals here and I got some great shots of them and where they lived. I got to drink iced tea from a plactic bag and had a great time looking around their shared kitchens and shops. Oi was well known by the locals here and they did not mind my intrusion into their daily lives one bit. At the end of the tour Oi took me to a Chinese temple which was a little different from the other temples I had seen. This is another tour I would recommend. In fact I don't think you can fault the range of tours BKK have."

If you are doing a little pre-tour checking to determine which Bangkok tour company to help with your site seeing, then stop looking. BKK Tours is hands down the absolute best! No matter what your site seeing preferences are, BKK can accommodate them. If you do not see what interests you on the standard tour packages, then simply ask and Air or Michiel will help you put together a tour package that does, which is exactly what they did for my business associate and me. Three days of customized touring, and not one glitch in the program. Our guides (Air and Gift) were knowledgeable, professional, and absolute delights. They went the extra distance to ensure that we were happy with the tour, including locating monkeys for photo ops, watching for (and finding) exotic birds in the coconut groves, and searching for Monitor lizards in the canals. Your average tour guide will not do that for you! The transportation (a luxury van) was clean, quiet, and cool, and the driver very safety conscious and courteous. The iced drinks and chilled towels that awaited us on our return to the van were especially welcome! The lunches were excellent and prepared by traditional Thai restaurants situated in scenic spots along the river (no worries germaphobes, the facilities were clean and bug free).Our three days of customized tours included too many sites to list in entirety here, so I will limit the discussion to just a few. The JEATH museum, Hellfire Pass, and the Chungkai War Cemetery are definite must sees. Whether you are a history buff or not, young or old, you cannot help but be moved by these sites and the reminder that so many sacrificed their futures in order for us to enjoy our todays. Walking between the tracks on the wooden railway bridges along the River Kwai is a wonderful way to see the river (from above) and the surrounding countryside. You can take the train ride, but then you have to fight for a window seat and the photo ops are more limited. Oh, if you are afraid of heights, then\u2026well, just do not look down!For the naturalist / botanist, the Tha kha Floating Market with a tour of a local coconut grove and sugar farm, the Suanluang Rama IX Botanical Garden, and a canal tour with a visit to the orchid farms should be added to your list of things to see. You will be rewarded with lots of colours, sites, and sounds if you do, including monkeys, birds, reptiles, exotic fruits, and beautiful flowers. Some the locations are in the dense jungle and reached by a rowboat (you do not have to help row unless you want to), while the others are reached by simply stepping out of the van. Remember to wear a hat and sunscreen, but no worries if you forget because the guide will provide you with a shade umbrella.In closing, no matter what your site seeing preferences are, BKK Tours can accommodate them. BKK Tours is hands down the absolute best!Blackwell & Company, LLCKristian C. Blackwell, CPA, CVA, CFEJuly 30, 2012"

Booked a whole day tour online with BKK Tours and it was the highlight of our Bangkok stay.Our guide Air provided us with a truly amazing Thai experience. Her command of English was extremely good and knowledgeable in all aspects. The husband and wife team were professional with prompt email replies, they were more than happy to accommodate our requests and gave us the choice to pay upfront or on the day.Our day was full-on, starting with the train market, floating market followed by a wonderful authentic Thai lunch set right on a river. Whenever we returned to our spectacularly decked out van, we were handed cold face washers and a cold bottle of water - much appreciated by the four of us.After a most relaxing lunch (included in the price) we made our way back to Bangkok to visit the Grand Palace & Emerald Temple, Reclining Buddha and ended with an amazing tour through the canals on a Longtail boat. I can thoroughly recommend Air without hesitation. She went beyond what we were expecting.Thank you Air and your wonderful driver."

We booked online, prepaid and correspondence pre-arrival was excellent. She offered helpful advice on using the fast train from airport to city and getting to our hotel safelyAir was such a great guide, and it was well worth the money investing in a few days of her time. With a young child (9yo boy) she was able to engage him and teach him some the culture and fully immerse us in the experience of Bangkok.Without Air I think we wouldn\u2019t have been able to navigate our way around with such efficiency and get as much out of visit as we did with her.On day 1 we visited an assortment of palace\u2019s and great locations \u2013 without her we would have seen some beautiful things BUT not really understood what we were looking at. She gave us history, cultural background and personal insight into Thailand and Bangkok. We did so much I can\u2019t even list them\u2026\u2026but it was worth every cent.Day 2 we were chauffeur driven (very polite and courteous man) in an extremely luxurious minivan, with 32\u201d TV and movies to entertain our son on our drive out to Kanchanaburi, war museum and River Kwai. We stopped at various interesting sights along like the salt farms & floating markets along the way.Air gave us lots of advice on how not to get caught by the \u2018tourist sellers\u2019, what was and wasn\u2019t a good buy and where we\u2019d get a better price.I would 100% recommend BKK Tours and Air as a guide and it was worth every cent, for all the memories she created for us. When in Bangkok again, we use again.From Sharon, Shayne and Brady"

            "review": "Best Tour of my Life (so far). Me and my friend stayed just five days in Bangkok and four of those days BKK Tours took excellent care of us. In short; it was the best tour experience we ever made. From the first E-Mail contact till the last Laa gawn everything was just great. I arrived Monday evening at 18:00 and we were picked up by the wonderful Air at 19:00 from the Hotel. Air showed us interesting night spots of Bangkok, we met local people, ate local food and drove with a tuk tuk through Chinatown. Air is a intelligent, charming and funny guide. We never felt we were just customers of her more like a friend. For the next three days Gift was our guide. First day she picked us up on time at the Hotel and we went to Ayutthaya. And same as with Air, she never gave us the \"just another customer\" feeling. Gift explained all the interesting parts, showed us great photo spots and the way she organized the tour, was that we always avoided the crowds. Again we ate excellent local food in a non tourist restaurant. Full of wonderful experiences and images in our heads we went back to the hotel in the late afternoon and we were sure that day would be the Highlight of \"Our days with Gift\". We were sure this day in Ayutthaya could not be topped. How wrong we were. Next day; Gift met us at the Hotel before 7:00. We went to Kanchanaburi and on my special request \"Elephant World\" a sanctuary for old and abused Elephants. Kanchanaburi is famous for the River Kwae and it's bridge. The place is nice and always very hot. We were lucky to have a mini van with air condition with us. After we saw the bridge we went by speed boat to a local restaurant down the river. Again excellent food and relaxing surroundings. After this; Elephant World. This place is just wonderful. And if you are interested in meeting local people or other people from around the world who work there as volunteer and also want to help the Elephants: you must go there!!It's not a tourist place. You have to do some work, get dirty and wet but what you will receive in return is so much worth it. The Elephants you meet here are old and some were abused but Elephant World is a place where they can live happy and free. It's an unforgettable experience to swim with them, see how they play in the water,... On our last day with Gift we went in the morning to the train market, which is an very interesting place and you have the chance to see and eat some very interesting food. This place is a bit too crowed with other tourist and their guides. Some of those other groups don't behave well and disturb the local people. But Gift took also care of them and remind them what they should not to. Gift always interacts very very well with the local people and they look sometimes they are friends. After that we went to Tha Kha floating market. Well I never been to another floating market but this place is just wonderful. No other tourists there except two other BKK groups, so it was like a BKK family meeting. And Gift chatted again in a very relaxed way with the local people there. We went with a old lady on her boat along the river through jungle like coconut and palm tree woods to a house of a very old woman who produces coconut sugar. It's amazing to see that. Those people were all so friendly to us.At noon back to Bangkok were we booked also the \"Bangkok Highlights\" tour. Saw the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew (temple of the Emerald Buddha). Finished the day with a boat tour through the clongs. In the end we had some time with Gift in a nice restaurant at the river to thank her for the experiences we made.BKK Tours is not cheap but as always; quality has it's prize. If you are looking for a great Thailand experience where you will get wonderful skilled guides, meet local people, eat at places where the locals eat and .... Don't look any further: If you ask yourself which guide you should book. I recommend BKK Tours with all my heart!!Now I am back at my office in Tokyo and just wonder when I can have my next tour with BKK.Kawpkoon Krab and Laa gawn Air and Gift!!"

We were also fascinated by the colourful vegetables sold in the market. Ms Oi bought us some local snacks too. Tha Kha floating market was recommended by Air since it coincides with our travel date. This market only opens on certain lunar dates, and we were lucky to be able to see a authentic floating market compare to the tourist one. We were also brought to see how palm sugar was made. Lunch was at a Navy Clubhouse along Chao Praya river. Overall, we were very happy by the service provided by Ms Oi from BKK Tours,"

We drove to Samut Songkram province to the railway market. On the way we stopped at a salt farm Air explained the process. We were able to take some photo's and ask questions of Air.When we arrived at the market we were able to walk through and with Air talk to the vendors. Air knew the best places to stand when the train came through. The whole market was fascinating. We then caught the train back through the market so that we could see the the vendors putting back their goods after the train had passed. The driver met us further down the line and was waiting with cold towels and water. We drove onto Saduak floating market, this was a busy market however Air made sure we saw important sights, we had time to browse and take in the surroundings wandering through the market on foot before going through the market by boat. Air helped me barter for a souvenir and we also had sampled some of the food. We did the \"meet the locals\" tour for our next trip. Air and Michiel collected us from our hotel and we went by taxi to Hua Lamphong station where we caught the train to Makkasan for a visit to a slum area. Michiel gave me some valuable photography tuition while we waited for train. Once at Makkasan we walked through the market talking to the stallholders before moving into the residential area. We met lots of interesting people and were able to talk with them with Air. After leaving Makkasan we visited a local amulet workshop where we could see large Buddha's being made before going over to Wat Suthat a temple off the tourist beat. The day finished with a trip down the river in a boat back to central area.Food, drinks boat fees,train tickets , tuk tuks were all included in the price of these tours. Throughout both trips Air pointed out things of interest. During the second trip Michiel gave me lots of tips and tuition in photography, while Air continued to point out things of interest to my partner and myself. Air and Michiel are an excellent team, they tailor the tour to your needs and wishes and never rush you along. We had two amazing trips and I would recommend BKK tours to anyone who want to see the sights in and around Bangkok. I would also recommend adding in the photography tuition from Michiel for anyone with an interest in photography. I will certainly do more trip with BKK tours."

Air came highly recommend by another friend who had a great experience with her months prior. We reserved her for 2 days. The first day, she took us on the Bangkok highlights tour. We not only got to see all the sights, but we also experienced Bangkok very locally by taking tuk tuks and river taxis. The highlight for us was not taking a long tail boat through the canals, but eating at the Navy Club restaurant with all locals. It was one of our favorite meals in Thailand! On the second day, Air picked us up to take us on the Market tour. We traveled to Samut Songkhram or the \"train market\" where Air provided us tastes of local fruits or anything we were interested in trying. Then, we went to the famous floating market and took a long tail boat around. Since it was our anniversary, Air set up a fabulous dinner at the Deck overlooking Wat Arun at sunset. After dinner, she took us out in Bangkok. First, we stopped at Khao San Road where all the backpackers go and got a big bag of crickets for us to try. My husband ate one and she got a picture of him that was priceless. After this experience, we had a drink at a nearby bar followed by another drink at the top of Lebua State Tower. We appreciate the time and planning that went into making our anniversary special. I highly recommend Air and BKK Tours as you feel like a friend. What a wonderful company!"

As I was by myself I thought I would benefit from a guide for each day, saving me having to sort things out for myself and leaving more time to take photos, my all-consuming hobby. The first was Bangkok highlights and the second was to Ayutthaya. What can I say? My guide Miss Gift was a delight! She took the time to find out just what interested me and then tailored the day to suit. The first day, hoping on and off different forms of local transport as well a walking (another thing I love) between some attractions, she took care of everything. From beautiful temples to the flower and vegetable markets, lunch at a lovely restaurant over the river, a tour of the 'Venice of the East' canals, she was a constant font of information, as well as a delightful companion. The second day was further afield in a air-conditioned vehicle with a pleasant friendly driver. Again I had a great day with the background and history at each site visited clearly explained in the most interesting manner. We visited temples and ruins, cruised the river and lunched at a restaurant that was 'local'. At all times Miss Gift was concerned for my comfort and again went to great lengths to point out those things she knew I was interested in. I would highly recommend BKK tours to anyone. Miss Gift was truly a gift to this tourist."

With their in depth knowledge of Thailand, they acquainted us to Thai people's customs and beliefs in such a friendly manner- in an extremely personalized tour, I felt that it was actually our friends who were showing us around. We rode different sorts of transportation going around Bangkok... We ate authentic Thai food and tried local delicacies... We didn't only see, learned and appreciated beautiful palaces, amazing temples and buddhas-- we also somehow connected with the people through them (Air and Gift) that the locals were willing to get their pictures taken with a smile.Air is such a warm company to be with, nice, friendly and kind- that makes her my favorite.  Michiel, my favorite photo tour guide is of course, great! When he learned that I'm just a beginner. He briefly but clearly explained to me the basics in photagraphy and as we go along, he taught me perspective and gave me some tips on how to make my pictures look more appealing. I learned a lot from him considering the limited time we had for discussion as we are scheduled to visit the Markets, Makassan slums, china town, a park for sunset shooting and some places for night photography. He explains, gives instructions and takes a few pictures to set as an example and then, lets us do our own thing patiently waiting until we've satisfied ourselves with our shots.Another favorite tour guide, Gift, paid careful attention to our comfort and made sure we were having fun. It's not just about the cold towels and nice cool van waiting for us after a tour. She took care of us like a friend would, to a friend.i.e, If you are a quiet person (like me), she, makes you feel at ease and engages you to friendly conversations, thus making you more comfortable with the tour-- Now that's just more than tour guiding. That's \"Extra Mile\" I wish I could enumerate more funny and cool extra mile experience with Gift, but this review will just go on and on..Yes, all three of them are my favorite. They all have different approach in making the tour comfortable and fun and I realized, whenever me and my sister talk about our Bangkok trip- they always play a part in our stories. :)"

We caught a taxi to the Makkasan station, had a look around at the local food market, and then walked through the slums of Makkasan. This was an amazing experience. Through Air, we spoke to the people who lived there, they were very friendly and some welcomed us into their homes to show us how they live. We visited Jim Thompson's Museum and visited the first silk factory in Bangkok. Truly fascinating to see how silk fabric is made from start to finish. Walking through the streets, we saw a local school, temple with monks, had lunch at a local restaurant. We then visited the Chatuchak market to pick a few treasures! Air assisted us with the bartering which was a great help. On the way back we called in to Chinatown also.This day was one of the highlights of a great trip to Thailand. Air was just wonderful - so friendly, knowledgeable, and nothing was too much trouble. She provided us with refreshments throughout the day. Lunch was included in our tour price. I would highly recommend BKK Tours to anyone wanting to see Bangkok."

After contacting a number of companies we decided to go with bkk based on the swift responses to emails, the price guide offered and the shaping of itineries to suite what we wanted to see. We did a day in Ayutthaya and a day in kanchanaburri that included markets on the way. We had an amazing time in Bangkok and these tours really made our experience unforgettable. Gift picked us up bright and early and off we went in a lovely mini van. Gift was a fantastic guide, easy going and managed to know what we wanted to find out from each place. Her knowledge and enthusiasm never dimmed through our two days and her photography skills were gratefully utilised! Lunch was included and gift made perfect choices that both of us enjoyed, including a lot of lemonade for us! If/ when we return to Bangkok we would use bkk and ask for gift. A lovely two days spent with a very knowledgable friend. Thank you."

She was able to customize each outing to our likes. We ventured off the beaten paths to local markets, restaurants as well as the must see attractions. Her transportation is a plush, air conditioned conversion, fully stocked with the necessities and an excellent driver (very safe) I would reccomend Air and BKK tours to anyone, since she tailors your experience to what you request. Our morning at the Palace and Temple, her vast knowledge of Thailand's history was remarkable and added so much to the incredible beauty. On a 1 to 10 scale, I give BKK Tours and Air an ELEVEN!"

This means that you get to deal with 'the boss' rather than a large faceless conglomerate.Air, our guide for the day, turned out to be the co-owner, with her husband , Michaile. BKK has obviously put masses of research into what visitors want when they visit Bangkok. We're short of time, not used to the temperatures and seeking a cultural, historical and contemporary experience all in the space of a day.A tall order, by anyone's standards, but we managed to see so much and all in an imaginative programme which included visits to the historic sites of Wat Pho and the Grand Palace and a trip on one of the famous long tailed boats. But it was the extras that really made a difference - we travelled by tuk tuk, water taxi, Sky Train and even walked, where we had the opportunity to eat some street food with the confidence that Air knew that the vendor was ok and the food was good quality. Air took us to a small temple, which is way off the visitor route which is where we experienced the true tranquility of Buddism.On a practical note, Air collects you from your hotel, provides refreshments and comfort stops throughout the day and takes you to the Navy Club for a very nice lunch, transport and entrance fees throughout your day are all included in the price and she takes you back to your hotel at the end of the day - great service throughout.We really liked the mix of old and new. Air is a qualified guide, she has graduated and has a wealth of knowledge about the history and industrialisation of Bangkok. What we were really impressed with was that she didn't take us to any of the usual 'gem markets', 'silk shops' or other over-priced tourist rip offs. She did, however, take us to the flower market and the vegetable market, which was really interesting, provided some great photo opportunities and allowed us to meet ordinary Thai people in their everyday settings.We would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending BKK Tours - you will not be disappointed.PS ask Air to sing the traditional name of what we today know as Bangkok - you will be amazed!"

We drove to the railway market stopping at a salt farm on the way. Air explained about the salt farm and we took some photos of the work. We went to the railway market and watched the train drive through. Air knew many of the stall holders and encouraged them to pose for photos. My friend likes to take photographs and Air spent the whole tour speaking to people and encouraging good photo opportunities. We took the train to the next station in order to drive through the market and Air arranged for my friend to sit in a seat at the end of the train to get a good view of the vendors putting back their products after the train drove through. We met the driver again and drove to the floating market, this was the touristy floating market as the more authentic one was not open today. The market was very interesting Air knew lots of the vendors again and some good photos to take. We had a boat ride through the market. Air took care of all the drinks and tickets etc as part of the cost of the tour. She also helped us barter for a souvenir and gave advice and information as requested. We had a really lovely tour and have booked another before we return home."

We started in the early morning and were picked up with a very comfortable minivan. During the 1h ride to the railway market Michiel explained the first important points of photography. One of us was advanced and the other one was less advanced but he was able to make it interesting for both of us. We can highly recommend this market and the short train ride. In the temples he explained how to take more creative photos and not to miss the wonderful details. Of course we learned also a bit of Buddhism. Afterwards Oi guided us through authentic Chinatown with lots of beautiful spots for example Chinese temples. We would never have walked these little streets or tasted these delicious snacks ... we would have missed all of this without Michiel and Oi. By the way: drinks, entry fees, snacks, lunch - everything was included. That made the tour very comfortable as we could concentrate on enjoying the day.Finally we want to thank Michiel, Oi and our driver Peter for this awesome daytrip, for taking care of us so well, for the loads of explanations about street photography and portraits, and of course for taking photos of us (it doesn't happen often to have pictures from us taken by a professional photographer).We would highly recommend the photography tour option to everybody (beginner or advanced) who wants to improve his photography skills. It's really worth the money."

Two years ago when I was visiting Bangkok with my son we were lucky enough to have Air (aka: Photjaman) for our guide. She took us around Bangkok the way a local would go. We took the Sky train, Subway, Tuk-Tuk, river boat, and occasionally a taxi. Air is a Thai woman who speaks excellent English and she is extremely knowledgeable about her culture and the touristic locations. She was also very nurturing; she was always ready with a cool towel or bottle of cool water on the hot days. She found wonderful temples to show us and even arranged for us to meet and speak to a Buddhist monk to explain the religion.  Air was supremely attuned to her client\u2019s capacities; she had an innate sense of how much her client can handle on a given day. She is incredibly generous with her time, often extending her tour long after the agreed upon time is over and willing to shorten it if I requested that.. Because of my great experience with her two years ago this year when my wife and I were planning a trip to Thailand, I contacted her to make the arrangements. Now she and her husband have their own tour company BKK tours. My wife needed to cancel the trip, but was ok with my going on my own. I had some reservations about traveling on my own but I decided to do it because I knew I could rely on Air. Air and her husband Michiel arranged a perfect amount of new tours for me. I was met at the airport and taken to my hotel. The next day I had a reorientation day with Michiel who helped me learn how to use the Sky Train for the days I was on my own. I spent many wonderful days touring with Air, learning history, culture and about life in Thailand. Air is one of the best tour guides I have ever had. I am nearly 73 years old and I have traveled a lot. I wholeheartedly recommend her and BKK tours. Richard D"

Everything went smoothly, Air was a gold mine of information about everything we were seeing, but also knew the best ways around the sites we saw. We went to the Bangkok flower market first, which was lovely, the flower arrangements and orchids are just mad. Then to the Royal Palace, to see the Emerald Buddha and the public rooms in the palace (the Throne Room). All the time Air made sure we saw everything and pointed out interesting features we would otherwise have missed. Tickets to everything were included inthe tour price so we never had to wait in line, and Air knew good shortcuts to avoid the crowds. We had lunch at a local restaurant overlooking the river, the restaurant was excellent and the food was lovely - lunch was also included, and we were free to select from the whole (very varied) menu of Thai dishes. We took a tuktuk to Wat Arun (the Reclining Buddha) and walked around a few of the surrounding temples and pagodas, which are beautiful, and then walked round the Reclining Buddha himself, who is just awesome. After Wat Arun, a private longtail boat through the canals across the river from the city, past old wooden houses, hidden temples and gardens. Throughout the day, Air was helpful and a delight to talk to, taking into account specific things we wanted to do and going out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. Thank you so much, Air. I definitively recommend BKK Tours for anyone looking for a more intimate insider's view of Bangkok."

Wanting to make sure we got everything we could out of Bangkok- we decided to hire a guide and we are so very glad that we did. We met Air on our first day in Bangkok for the city highlights tour. We loved using tuk tuks and the skytrain to get around- much more of a local feel and so fast and convenient. Air was so knowledgeable about the temples, Grand Palace and history of Thailand. We also enjoyed the Flower Market tour and a longtail boat ride. We had a wonderful lunch at an authentic Thai restaurant (we were the only Americans there). Spending the day with Air gave us real local feel of Bangkok and we saw sights and tried foods we never would have on our own.We also booked the half day market tour with Air for the following day and could not wait to spend more time with her. We absolutely loved the railway market and again tried so many local foods we never would have known about on our own. We visited both the local floating market (Tha Kha) and the touristy Damnoen Saduak-- great way to get a feel for both and see the difference. During the tour of Tha Kha we took a row boat to the Palm Sugar farm and it was absolutely eye-opening and moving; quite an impressionable part of our trip.Overall we had two wonderful days with Air and gained a greater appreciation and understanding for Thailand that we'll forever be thankful for. I wholeheartedly recommend BKK Tours for anyone traveling to Thailand!"

Gift, very friendly and helpful, she loves children and she speaks very good english. The floating market was rather crowded since it's so popular, but mrs.

We could tell her what we would like to see or do, and she would do her very best to make it happen! The railway market was very special to see, and our guide was looking very carefully if it was safe for the children.

We found many who were listed, but only 2 who responded to our inquiries. Somehow, through the friendliness of the BKK response, we decided to go with them. They pulled together a 20-day itinerary that hit all of our points-of-interest...and not just in Bangkok...but in Chiangmai, Chiang Rai and Phuket as well.One doesn't need to spend much time with Air adn Michiel to realize that wonderful friendships have been forged. Air and Michiel love people and people love them! As for their tours...Air's alley walking tour of Chinatown, the boat trip to the sugar plantation, the visits to the many temples and the tours of the various markets were unforgettable. She took us to terrific out-of-the-way restaurants; she took us on longtail boat tours; tours to palaces; tours to temples; day tours; night tours; BKK helped us experience Bangkok in a way that I suspect few others do. Further, BKK set us up with additional guides and scheduled more unforgettable activities in Chiangmai...Tiger Kingdom; elephant tours; walking tours; shopping tours; a Thai cooking class...all experiences that should not be missed. It was the same when we went from Chiangmai to Chiang Rai...and again when we went to Phuket. We finished our trip in Bangkok with Air and Michiel. It was hard to say goodbye as they had made our entire Thailand experience one that will live forever in our hearts and memories. We have traveled extensively throughout Europe, Africa, South America, and other parts of Asia. I simply can't recommend BKK enough. Use them! You'll never regret it!"

It was such an adrenaline rush, biking through Bangkok one rainy afternoon.Follow Me Bike Tours has given me quite a memory...from the lovely Teddy who was our guide...super attentive, knowledgable and very sweet-natured. I saw a side of Bangkok which I could have seen only while riding the bike in the narrow lanes, straight through the heart of Bangkok. We went to monasteries and Chinese temples and tried Chinese snacks and herbal teas. The best ofcourse, was the Royal Temple. It was breath-taking and such a heart-warming ceremony of folding the lotus flowers and offering it to Lord Buddha. The bicycles are strong and make riding in the rains seem like a cake-walk. If you like trying activities which are a little off the beaten path...do try this and the best people to try it with is 'FOLLOW ME BIKE TOURS' :)"

That was not so disappointing, as I didn't relish a long day on a bike in the the drizzling rain. I was told that I could return the next morning for the 4 hour ride -- good option. The next day, there were a total of 7, with the personable and professional guide, Tong. Although I was apprehensive concerning riding a bike through Bangkok, there were only a couple of instances of waiting to cross a busy 4 land highway; otherwise, the ride took us through offbeat side alleys - with lots to see, along with a nice of tourists (like me). I've visited Bangkok and taken tours before, but next time, Follow Me Bike Tours, will be my first choice. I am a 60+ male, and the ride was very doable and a lot of fun."

It gave us all a better insight into the day to day life in old Bangkok, the flower markets and China Town. The Temples and the Turtles were highlights too. Teddy was a great guide and kept everyone interested in what was around us. Because it was a question I had as a parent I make the following comment. This bike ride did include riding on some busy roads for short distances. I'm not sure I would have wanted to take this ride with younger children because some traffic awareness is required, but with older children and teens we found it fine.This day remains one of our Bangkok highlights. Thank you Follow Me Bike Tours and Teddy."

The guide was informative and provided us with all the relevant information as well as brought us everything needed on the tour which includes cow tongue, water, boat fare, Thai whiskey and vodka. The tour guide was very encouraging to try new things. The tour seemed extremely local as we were really submerged in with locals, every side road and alleyway was buzzing with residents either washing clothes, playing in the street or in their homes. The only downside of this tour is sheer physical energy needed to complete the tour coupled with the Bangkok heat (and pollution). Other than that, hats off to Follow Me Bike Tours, definitely an interesting perspective on Bangkok."

You'll try some new and interesting foods, enjoy the sights and sounds of another side of Bangkok and get to do somethign a little unique.

By the time we returned to our hotel, Follow Me had already emailed us the photos they took of our tour.Our guide (Tom) was enthusiastic and made sure everyone was safe and happy.Unlike some tours where you are pressured to pay extra for certain activities or buy from a particular shop, with Follow Me everything was included in the upfront tour cost. Tom even bought us some Thai snacks from the market to try, and food for feeding the fish in the park.The tour lasted around 4.5 hours, but had plenty of breaks to see the sights so should be fine for anyone who is reasonably fit. You do need to be confident on a bike, as there are some narrow alleyways and busy roads before catching the boat to the jungle."

The lady at the reception just called our guide, who arrived ten minutes later. So we had a private tour for 2. The guide was very kind, gave us very useful information and learned us a some new things on Buddhism in Thailand. He even paid some things for us upfront during the tour. When you run into some Tiger Balm on the Chinese market for example.

We booked the Siam Sawan tour exploring the Phra Pradaeng peninsula for ourselves and our two sons (10 & 12 years old) - definitely a side of the city we haven't experienced! A certain amount of cycling experience is required with the start and finish of the tour traversing congested main roads and numerous narrow alleyways - recommend helmets despite them not being compulsory. The long boat trip to the peninsula and back was something special with 5 riders and 5 bikes on board! However the couple of hours we spent cycling through what is considered the 'lungs of Bangkok' was truly a contrast to the usual city sights. Lush and green with abundant flora and fauna (including a giant monitor lizard, much to the delight of my sons!), we all thoroughly enjoyed this unexpected side of Bangkok. Follow Me Bike Tours also have a lovely 'clubhouse' with a fish foot spa and a resident cockatoo who likes to be fed bananas! Highly recommended for something different."

We rode through all sorts of areas that we would never think of, like local neighborhood alleys. The drivers in Thailand are so polite that they let us cross through busy intersections! (amazing!) The bike trip is by far the best experience I ever had in Bangkok. A very well-organized tour, we felt safe with Tom as he took great care of us (treating us herbal teas and dessert) and my parents love to have another bike tour when they travel to another country!Would love to try their jungle bike tour next time!

Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and made us always feel safe. I especially liked the insight into Thai culture and the lesson on how to prepare a lotus flower for temple offering.About 4 hours & 20km across flat ground, with many well timed stops, the ride was easy. Our guide provided a safety demonstration, drinks and some Thai snacks we picked up at the markets.The clubhouse was a little difficult to find for our taxi, but the people were super friendly (like most Thai people) and very clean when we were there. I thoroughly recommend to young adults and up (it probably wouldn't suit kids as there was a few times when we had to ride on the road)."

Amazing tour, very silent atmosphere and very different from the normal Bangkok state of mind. Cycled like 30 minutes before entering a long-tail boat to get to the peninsula, and then we enjoyed 2 hours in the old plantation where you cycle on not-so-wide pavements elevated from water. On our way back we visited a Thai museum that displays how (old) houses were created. Very interesting. During the trip our good guide took a lot of pictures, which we were supposed to be able to download from the company website afterwards. Can recommend anytime. This was my 3 trip with them."

Mathew, the guide from Follow Me, is very nice, he tells you what to expect and does a great job navigating through the busy streets. He made the ride fun by including a stop to feed the fish, a stop to play the sling shots and treated us to a selection of local street food. The schedule is well organized and the ride is finished with some ice cream and fish spa. If you are done with food and massage rituals in Bangkok, try this - something different. The follow me club house meeting point is tuck at the back of alleys so allow some extra time to get there. There are many 7-11 so be careful (the instruction includes passing a 7-11)."

Plenty of drinks offered before, during and after the trip along With stops For snacks. Group sizes are kept to 8Max normally and that's a good idea as we saw much larger groups which would have made it Very difficult to hear everything, toKeep together and I think to enjoy it as much. Everything has been thought of with this company - you can even have a foot fish spa when you return while eating your complimentary ice cream. Great to see parts of Bangkok you wouldn't otherwise see. Deserve every success. Would recommend but advise to be fairly competent with cycling skills to negotiate lumps, bumps and traffic."

Don't forget your camera as you definitely will see a different Bangkok as explained in your travel book. Don't miss the graffiti train. Crossing Chao Praya River on a long tail boat gives you time to relax and the \"Green Lung\" of Bangkok is a real bikers paradise with shadow, trees, parks and markets. Some paths are elevated so stay concentrated not to fall into the mud. Matthew organized lot of local snacks to try so we had a great time between activities and culinary experiences. The timing was perfect, sufficient time for pictures, talks or simple to observe. A great team activity and a great way to explore Bangkok form a very different side or angle."

After reading so many reviews online, i finally chose Follow Me Bike Tours as it seemed to be the most doable and had so many good reviews. Taking the BTS from NaNa stn onwards during morning rush hour was fine but when we had to walk to their location, it turned out we walked one huge round when we could've taken the shortcut through the private gate. Either way, we were lucky enough to find someone who directed us in the right direction and we had time to chk out our bikes and get warmed up. My son, 9yrs old, and i are not avid bike riders and have never ridden bikes on the streets so i was VERY apprehensive about riding on the streets. The back lanes etc were all so narrow that a person wouldn't even be able to stretch out their arms fully! Our guide Tom, was very personable and informative. He took quite good care of us, with refreshment stops, coconut custard sticky rice was awesome etc ... though I did lag behind the pack, he tried to keep us on schedule and we all made it to the very end, and my son LOVED the tour! This was the main reason i chose to do a bike tour because it's a one of a kind learning, yet active experience. Definitely highly recommend. Though I think you guys should invest in a Go Pro for better camera coverage etc for customers. Thank you Follow Me Bike Tours & Tom!!"

I booked directly with Follow Me on their website and I was impressed with their promptness and detailed responses. They even emailed me a map to locate them as it can be tricky to find their base. Upon arrival we were offered cold drinks and given our free caps. They also offered a helmet but it's your choice whether you wear one or not. Our guide was Tao and he was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable. We cycled through back alleys, side roads and even on the crazy Bangkok main roads however I felt safe at all times. Even negotiating the traffic became second nature within a very short space of time. Amongst many sights, we also visited temples and markets. Wat Arun is currently under construction so I don't think they would stop there at the minute but I really wanted to see it so Tao made sure we drove past and popped in. By the end we were shattered and a little drained as you need to keep a high level of concentration on the busy streets however all in all it is an excellent way to spend an afternoon in Bangkok. "

They had a great safety movie on a large flat screen television prior to departure. They also provided neon green caps to each person. The company offers to hold personal items in a secure room. They have a toilet to use in the office as well.It was hot and the tour stopped five times for water & liquids (which was included in the payment). This is NOT a tour for the faint of heart; the traffic was heavy, the surface rough, crossing streets was dangerous, and the 120 degree turns on narrow paths on the bikes was challenging. We participated in the half day Siam Tour that departed at 1:30. We rode through the back alleys that one would not usually view. It gave a perspective of non- 3+ star hotel areas. As people from the USA we had to ride on the opposite side of the road, which also caused some stress. The guide stopped at THE 24/7 hour flower market of the country of Thailand in Chinatown. He offered interesting information on flowers, traditions to the culture, fruits & vegetables. I do recall praying several times to get me back to the home office in one piece :=D. After the flower market the ride was out of traffic and delightful.It was a memorable experience and we highly recommend it with a word or two of caution.(ADVICE on the DIRECTIONS: After you leave the BTS follow the crowd bearing left, past the first steps. Continue until it goes into a \u2018T\u2019 (or end). At that point turn right (crossing above the street on the bridge) and go down the first steps on the left. There are 7-Elevens everywhere in Bangkok and you should be on the right side of the street with the turn to the office immediately prior to the first 7-Eleven on the right. We tried to follow the directions provided and ended up walking up and down three sets of steps to get there. It was not a good way to start a 23 km bike ride in hot heat. Hope this helps."

Returning to the city, we rode on quite heavy-trafficed roads, but there were no problems whatsoever.Experiencing Bangkok this way is recommendable for anyone who can ride a bike.

For me the highlight of the tour was visiting the Bangkok flower market, where Wit purchased lotus flowers for the group. We then visited a temple where we were taught how to fold the lotus flowers in the traditional Thai way and then left them as offerings.Wit was an excellent guide! Once our tour was over, he helped us in getting a taxi back to our hotel and recommended a fantastic place for us to do some shopping afterwards (Platinum Fashion Mall). Next time in Bangkok we will certainly do this tour again!"

It's a great way to get familial with the city. Most of the tour is done through back alleys and side roads and not on major streets which made the ride much more interesting. Bikes are in great condition. Helmets are offered but not mandatory. Water and snacks are provided during the tour Matthew was great in providing information about the city and local culture. Our only disappointment was that we didn't have more time to take the Siam Sawan Jungle Tour."

I booked the tour using TA a couple of days prior and they were great in communicating with me via email, including sending very detailed instructions on the best way to get to their clubhouse to start the tour. You really do see parts of Bangkok that we would have never seen, including sampling some street food suggested by our guide, Wit. It was a hot day and my wife and I were the only ones on the tour so we probably got a little extra attention, but I imagine any size tour would get the same type of service. The biking isn't hard but you do have to pay attention because you are going down residential paths and streets. You also get the thrill of some travel on the busy Bangkok streets. Once our tour was over, Wit helped us in getting transportation back to our destination. If you are in Bangkok, this is a great activity to try!"

Unfortunately even though we left early and returned late we weren't able to complete everything in the set trip itinerary, I think the only way to so is if you ride extremely fast, even then I'm not sure.

I recommend taking the bts but we took taxi which was very difficult to get the driver to understand where we wanted to go.Near the end I requested for us to take back roads /ally ways for my 10year old ..

Although it may sound like a crazy idea to go biking in a city like Bangkok with all the traffic and the heat, it is one of the best ways to explore this amazing city! Our guide Matthew was great and very experienced and took us through small alleys, quiet roads and hidden paths so it did not feel like going through the city. He also did a very good job to manage the group of 10 people including a family of 4 who was obviously a lot less experienced in bicycling than the rest (honesly, I was worried they would not make it through the tour, but they did!!!). It was our 5th visit to Bangkok and we saw many familiar areas but also several new locations. Indeed very recommendable! Easy to reach via Skytrain is also a big plus in Bangkok... :-)"

The Bangkok bike tour was more eye opening and culturally enriching than anything else we experienced for the 2 weeks we were in Thailand. You don't need to be a fit cyclist to leisurely follow the group through the small alleys and streets of the city, all you need is common riding ability and a desire to explore and experience something off the well beaten tourist path with an experienced guide. I won't ruin the excitement of the stops and the sites and sounds, but do yourself a favor and don't think twice about booking it. Our guide Tom was fantastic and spoke very good English to point out the significant parts of the ride, and we couldn't thank him enough when it came to an end.

We got to take a peak into some of the outskirts of Bangkok and the different lifestyles as well. It was awesome that our tour guide took pictures of us so that we could focus on our ride and not put our safety in jeopardy trying to take that selfie. The tour group was small which allowed for more personalization to the tour as well. The biking was challenging but in a great way. There were a bunch of windy, thin roads in the jungle but it wasn't frowned upon if you needed to quickly put your feet down around turns. Because we had taken more leisurely bike tours in the past, we opted out of the helmet and wore flip flops - I would recommend a helmet and sneakers!"

He was knowledgeable, very friendly and had a fun and pleasant personality.Riding through the jungle area was great. The \"Lungs of Bangkok\" was an interesting and diverse place. It was a quiet patch of lush nature in the middle of a huge, busy city. It's a good idea to have some reasonable cycling skills to maneuver around some of the tight turns on the skinny raised pathways. We were given plenty of drinks and yummy traditional snacks. The boat ride back and forth was short and well organized.We really appreciated all the photos that Tom took while riding. He was pretty good at that.Riding through the streets of Bangkok, especially in early morning rush hour was exhilarating, a bit freaky, and definitely memorable.I would recommend this tour to others.

I was the only one at that time, but they decided to let the tour go through anyway, without any extra charge (even though it was not their policy apparently). Really appreciated that.This tour is a bit longer than the evening tours available at other companies (5-6 hours in stead of 3-4), which I liked. Although it does mean you will be back later than usual.They take you through the narrow backstreets of Bangkok, nice places like the flower market, and a street food dinner in Chinatown (included). You'll get to know what all those stalls actually sell. Since they all got signs in Thai only, it can be somewhat intimidating for a first time tourist. Certainly when some of the dishes include intestines and things like pig blood jelly, haha! :)I was a lot more confident buying food from those place after this!The tour also takes you to places like Wat Po and Wat Arun at night (yes, it's open then!). Much better temperatures than during day time. All in all you get to see quite a lot.Bikes were of excellent quality (mine had several gears, which I liked)Afterwards they send you a series of pictures and videos taken during the trip, also nice!"

He took his time and explained to us the history and backstory behind each attraction. We also got to learn a little more about his life in Bangkok and growing up in Northeast Thailand. Highly recommended tour for those who want something different! We enjoyed biking through the backstreets and seeing some of the more famous attractions at night and without a lot of tourists. Biking experience required - we biked through tiny back alleys and next to mopeds and cars. The entire tour went from 5pm to 11pm but we walked around a bit in between biking.

The guide was so lovely and provided us with drinks and snacks all the bike tour. We even got to taste some local treat if we wanted to. The nature at Siam Sawan was amazing, and I really recommend every one to take the trip. The only thing that surprised me was that we rode so much inside Bangkok city before we took the boat over to the jungle, but I didn't mind that. Back at the club house we got ice cream, watched the pictures the guide had taken and enjoyed the fish spa. I personally loved the trip, but since we rode in the traffic between cars for a while, I'm not sure if it's that safe for young children."

This time I booked myself and some friends in, for the evening tour, and was pleasantly surprised when again our tour guide was Ah. A fantastic night tour, which took on a completely different perspective during the evening. Once again we all felt very safe, and the sights smells, and scenery were spectacular. A wonderful evening Meal In yarrowat (Chinatown), and a really wonderful and relaxing evening's riding. Seeing Wat Po at night without crowds was really impressive and serene, and Ah is so knowledgable and friendly, he really is an assett to the tour company. I hope to bring my wife and son to a tour eventually. Very impressive company and very happy once again.Tim"

The contrast from the skyscrapers and the 1-2 story local houses was spectacular to see as one biked by. The guide was excellent even though there was not much time to stop and take pictures. This was not a problem as the guide provide pictures which was really nice. So a surprisingly different tour of Bangkok from a different perspective."

Firstly the the start point is not easy to find as it is well off the normal tourist route. Our tour guide was ill-prepared. He was not dressed in the usual vivid green Tee Shirt the others had, that made him difficult to spot in busy streets at times. His bike was old and damaged. The other tour left before we did (we were the only 2 on our tour today) and our guide was unaware that he was leading us. He looked confused then seemed to pull himself together and assured us all was well. We set off. It was fine for the first section though his English was limited and at times he slipped into Thai! About an hour in, we reached a temple and stopped for photos etc. He disappeared, bike and all, for over 10 mins without saying a word! There were many other odd instances, small in themselves but we became concerned about his wellbeing. We completed the tour but, on reflection, we wondered about our safety at times. Our guide behaved oddly, especially once we returned to the base, despite our kindness and concern towards him. When we voiced our concern to the two guys in charge, one looked concerned, picked up his phone and walked away from the building. We did not see him again. The second guy was apologetic and walked with us to a road, and hailed a taxi for us. All rather bizarre. A bike tour is a great way to see the real city, the places where the people live, shop, eat and go to school. I will definitely do another, but cannot recommend this tour company on today's showing."

I've been to BKK many times and am used to the usual party scene, which gets old quick. If you are more adventurous and looking for a unique experience this tour is for you! We spent time biking through some of the more popular tourist attractions like Wat Pho and Chinatown but also snaked through some local back alleys for a glimpse into the everyday lives of the Thai people. We were welcomed with smiles, smell of freshly cooked Thai spices and surprises around every corner. Next time I'm in BKK, I will try out the cycle/food tour for sure."

We even crossed the river (by boat).The company provides everything you need, and the equipment is very good.

Our guide was so friendly and this has to be the most memorable thing we've done in a long time. Unfortunately our bike riding skills were a little sloppy so we found it hard at first but once we got the hang of it again, it was not too difficult. Having said that, riding though narrow alleyways, crossing the street in fast moving traffic, and riding next to large vehicles was a little terrifying. This tour is exhausting though so drink plenty of water. Even though it was a morning tour, it starts getting hot around 10.The guide provided us with enough drinks and snacks so we never felt thirsty during the tour. Finding the office was very easy, and I'd recommend using the skytrain to avoid the traffic and rude taxi drivers. There is also a fish foot spa in their office but I didn't try it. Overall a great experience that I would recommend everyone to do. I'll definitely book another tour with Follow Me Bike Tours in the future."

We started out with degrees below 20, but the sun came out and the sky was clear, so it was a really nice day. Our guide Ae made the tour memorable with his smile and knowledge of Bangkok, the places we visited, Thai culture and history. We were only 4 on the tour, so it was a small group. This meant that we did not have to wait for a big group to pass streets etc. Ae guided us safely through the busy Bangkok traffic. We started on the \"city\" side and saw lots of places. Chinatown means busy, -and it was, but we had a nice walk down the streets and saw all the sellers. Ae bought snacks that we had later at a small place by the river. Then we crossed the river and went to the more quiet side. It was quite a contrast with a lot of low building and small streets. The pedestrian/bicycle road along the river was very nice. The biking was not hard. You do not need to be very skilled, but of cause you need to be able to ride a bike. If you go for the bike ride alone, you might want to take one of the longer tours. We finished off with ice cream and a cold drink at the clubhouse. All in all a very nice day."

We had already been to some of the landmarks during the day but going at night gave a far different perspective. We had dinner in Chinatown amongst the throngs of people and were treated royally by the local street food vendors. What an experience cycling through the traffic of Bangkok, which I thought was going to be terrifying for my wife, but in the whole pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and motor vehicles of all sizes were respectful of us as road users, we felt safe.

By using mostly small back streets one really got to see the real side of Bangkok. It was impressive to see. The route the tour guide uses is great. It's a long bike ride but there is so much to see, before you know it the afternoon is gone. The bike tour guide gives you ample time to look at the different sites you visit, provides enough food and drinks along the way and knows things about every stop you make.

My expectations were quite low, but I have to admit that the guys at Follow me were great. The bikes were well serviced and the guide took us along interesting back roads and event onto a boat. The jungle area we went to was a really interesting park and we even got to see a monitor lizard. If you have been to Bangkok and are looking for something a bit different I can highly commend this. Just remember the following - A good self wicking t shirt (as it will be hot), trainers, shorts, a back pack (mainly for water) and a big grin."

We signed up for the morning Siam Boran tour, and had a great time cycling around the back streets and side lanes, passing by the old Customhouse, visiting Chinatown and the flower market, crossing the river, stopping in to visit some temples and feeding the turtles at one. We saw so much more than we would have via foot or if we had been by ourselves, and our guides (Ah and Noi) did a great job getting us across the busier roads. There were only 9 of us on the tour, which was a manageable number and having two guides meant that there was always one to lead the way and another to keep on eye on everyone and help with the few busier intersections. At the end of our bike rise we enjoyed a foot spa with the cleaner fish back at Follow Me HQ as well as a cheap and tasty lunch that they organised on our behalf (as an extra). A fantastic way to get a feel for the less commercial side of Bangkok if you're short on time like us (and don't want to think too much!), or just do it anyway as a great introduction to the city"

I had previously done an old city bike tour with another company and loved it, so wanted to do it again with the kids. However, that other bike company was closed for the New Year's holiday, so I chose to go with Follow Me Bike Tours. Overall, it was fun and we got to see different things than my previous tour, but our guide (although very sweet and kept us all together) was terribly boring....maybe she was the only one available to work on the holiday, is my guess. We found ourselves ready to keep moving on from one stop to the other after a quick overview at what we were looking at, but she couldn't read the body language, that our group of 7, didn't need all the nitty gritty details. Everything was closed because it was New Year's Day (not her fault, of course), so we didn't have our snacks until later in the ride at one of the temples and everyone was famished. The temples were packed and very busy for the holiday and it was fun being amongst that excitement. We almost didn't see the one place we wanted to see, the Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn), because she said we didn't have enough time. We begged for a quick ride by and she agreed, but then after that, she took us to 2 more stops even though it was getting dark. 3 of the bikes' lights did not work, but fortunately, the back alleys weren't too dark to see our way back to the Clubhouse. This tour was probably the same length as their competitor's, but it seemed much longer. We all got free green baseball caps, ice cream when we returned and lots of pictures of us that our guide took along the way...she emailed them that evening and we were not charged for them. Bikes were not as nice or as good of shape as the competition. Good instructional short video before we left...added humor so it wasn't so boring."

They have several tours to choose from and, in the one I chose, I didn't get to see the hotspots (touristic locations) but it was so much better. I cannot stress this enough, it was really good. We got to see all the little streets and get an idea of how Bangkok really is like. If you do this trip you will find yourself pedaling a lot through backroads and alleyways, seeing real locals doing their thing. You'll stop at several \"hidden\" gems and will have the time of your lives. This is suited for people of all ages as long as they can pedal. Our tour lasted 5 hours but it is not exhausting because we made several stops and Bangkok is a plain place.FREE beverages were offered to us (before, during and after the trip). Ferry trips were also free.It was my birthday so they went to Dunkin Donuts and actually sang me happy birthday. Amazing touch on their part!! Being a solo traveller, it really moved me. Thank you.Bikes are new and comfortable.I had to sign in to make my first comment on TripAdvisor. Can't recommend them enough!"

Our guide took us through narrow streets, quiet corners, showed us Chinatown, markets and temples and provided a lot of Information. He guided is very well, took pictures from us and always informed us what's next - so no reason to worry about risks. We totally enjoyed the tour and we can absolutly recommend the Follow Me Team to everyone! We would do a bike tour with them anytime again!"

He was informative, nice, and spoke English well. I went with two Germans (I'm American), and though I thought 2,000 baht was a lot to pay, but I would say it was totally worth it. You get an idea of the city, the temples, and food/culture. Benefits of this ride and paying 2,000 baht: 1. ALL expenses included. You take a ferry twice (normally you have to pay but the guide will pay this for you) and our guide bought drinks at least 3 times. Water is provided, and ALL food is included. We even got ice cream at the end! You do not pay anything else if you don't want to. You have opportunities to walk (like in china town) and you can buy some things if you want.2. Having a Thai guide who obviously understands culture, language barriers, food and directions!!3. Ah knows Bangkok. You could call this the \"Alley\" tour of Bangkok. He took us places I would have never gone and through alleys you would never take. 4. It's absolutely safe. I am surprised at how safe I felt in Bangkok at night on a bike. There was NOT one point I felt unsafe. The only thing to look out for is random potholes and low lying roofs. I would say 75% was off the main streets, and 25% on the Main Streets. Traffic was good and not a problem.5. Small tours. Only 3 guys total on our tour. Ah said they only take up to 6 people on the tour. This is much smaller than other bike tours I have done which can be as much as 15 people. Ask your guide questions about Thai culture and you can learn as much as you want.6. Great tour. Good bike. Do it. You won't regret it."

Our guide was great - Tiu in Thai and Matthew for the foreigners to comprehend his name!He took us to some neighborhoods that nobody would go alone during the day. As sad as it may be, you are confronted with the true reality of some of these neighborhoods and the harsh reality of one of the most asynchronous and unequal cities of the world.We've been in the flower market - my favourite part - we've been explained a lot about the religion and culture of this country and people. We've done a super cool ritual with a lotus flower that Tiu bought us to use in one of the temples we've visited. We've asked for protection and whatever you'd come up with that you need in your life to the sitting Buddha!Bangkok is far from a beautiful city and charm is something that it surely doesn't have... so you'd better know the reality of it through these guys!4 hours pedaling - sometimes through heavy traffic roads - don't worry though... they make sure you pass in safety - even if Tiu has to stop in the middle of an avenue with his hand raised and stopping the traffic for you :)"

Also went to some hidden restaurants that again would not have found on our own. Did a bit of walking so lots of exercise there. Straight after it finished we were dropped off at the clubhouse and straight into the bike tour. Really enjoyed that riding through the small back alleys where people were going about their daily lives. Great way to experience the real city. The riding was not hard but we clocked up some kms during the afternoon. Our guide was great fun always having a joke and he was also very informative. We could have split the tour into two days but very glad we did it this way. We are both about 60 and managed it fine so that will give you an idea of how hard it is."

We went through little tiny backyards and streets and got in touch with the \"real\" Bangkok. Beside the huge tourist hotspots you'll get a different impression of Bangkok's people and way of life. Very remarkable was Matthews knowledge about the different religions which exist next to each other and together in Bangkok. The whole tour felt individual and special, like created just for us.

And we can't wait to recommend it to our friends if they ever visit Bangkok)An interesting note that made me to write this review:In the bike clubhouse they have a cockatoo parrot, apparently out of boredom and lack of friends, he is plucking his own feathers...(according to the vet).when we finished our tour we started to pay a little attention to him, and discovered what a friendly little chap he is!he loves people rubbing on his head and neck area, you will see how he enjoys it by lowering his head down for you to rub...once you gain his trust, he will try to climb on your arm or shoulder, I keep rubbing his neck and I was asking him'are you ok?' 'Are you happy now?' You can see that he will response to you by nodding his head!!When we had to leave it was hard to say goodbye... we said 'bye bye' and he replied 'bye bye' too! So if you have time after the amazing bike tour, please come to say hello and play with the little guy for a few minutes, maybe we can all help him to feel happier and stop his hair plucking problem!"

I've never done a biking tour before but we decided to do this because my husband is prone to blisters in the tropical environments so it's difficult to always be walking for him. I am glad we decided to do this because it was different and active. Our tour guide was Ah, he took us through the city of Bangkok first to the Chinese temple, then the flower market, then China Town, and last to the Temple of Dawn. What's nice is he will take you through the back roads where Thai people drive their motorcycles through town so you see parts of the city where people live that you wouldn't see on a \"normal\" tour. We had a group of 10 (8 others in addition to us) all from different countries, we are from the U.S., Ah spoke fine English and was very nice. We did have one older fellow who Ah did forget to slow down for, but he always stopped and looked back to make sure we were with him. If you are worried about biking through traffic, it's really not too bas as the Thai people are used to driving around bikers and motorcyclists, as long as you stay to the left and stay with your group you should be fine."

By the time the tour was over, my husband and I were both falling asleep and not really paying attention. The only thing I wish we had known was we were told we were going to see the Reclining Buddha on the bike tour. We visited the grounds on the tuk-tuk tour but the buddha was already closed.

The bike tour was just the ticket. Exciting, exhilarating and informative. We saw parts of the city that we never knew existed and met some genuinely lovely people en route. Cycling through the city streets was not as bad as we thought. Clear and safe instructions from our excellent guide made you forget where you were.....Rama 3 road on a bicycle. After leaving the busy road, we were ambling through back streets and across railway tracks until we reached the river. The long boat took us to the swamp/forest area where the real excitement began. Words cannot fully describe the adrenalin rush of speeding along the narrow pathways above the swamp water. Some basic cycling skill is needed especially with the 90 degree turns....and a lot of confidence. However the rewards are fantastic and you will remember the trip for a long time with some excellent action photos courtesy of your guide. For the ultimate experience, plan a thunder storm for the final hour !!!!."

The guide (can't remember his name unfortunately) was really informative and his English excellent. We booked the Siam Sawan tour which incorporated a white knuckle ride through busy Bangkok streets, then through part of a slum (not as bad as it sounds). Then we boarded a long tail boat to motor over the Chao Phraya to Phra Pradaeng; a lush green forest where people live amongst the Palm trees. Amazing to see this so close to the pollution of Bangkok. From there we went to a conservation park to feed the ginormous fish and on to one of Thailand's former Prime Minister's houses - a great example of a traditional Thai house. Refreshments and snacks were provided throughout, and we were able to stop at any point to ask questions or take photos. Also the guide took a number of photos on his own camera - a week after the tour, a link was emailed over to download. The fish foot spa at the end of the tour and the complimentary tea was a nice touch. I can honestly say this tour was one of the best things I've ever done. If visiting Bangkok you must do it."

I lucked out and was the only person on my city tour so I was treated to a great personal experience with my guide Peter.

Ahh was very kind in escorting us slowly through the weekend market there and allowing us plenty of time to taste Thai foods and drinks. As well we really enjoyed playing with the sling shots that one elderly vendor had set up a small target range for, and Ahh even included that price in our tour. The bikes were semi-well maintained, for having lots of customers and tours they definitely showed some wear and tear, but were still completely safe to ride. I recommend the beach cruiser style cushion seat for these longer tours as I rode the mountain bike and my bum is still sore hahaha!Follow Me Bike tours is the best way to see the \"Real\" Bangkok!"

The place is very nice decorated with lots of plants. They showed us a funny video about what we were going to do and what was expected from us. Our guide Peter was very nice. He had a lot of information and knew the answers to all our questions. We saw many interesting things. And last but not least he guided us safely through the busy Bangkok streets. He bought snacks and drinks for us halfway. You could get water at any time. It is really nice to explore Bangkok by bike, it goes faster than walking and is also not that warm. The bikes where good too. I am a stewardess so I have done many tours before. But this is one of the best I have done."

It's a little difficult to find the location via taxi but when we got there we were greeted by very friendly staff. We were given a safety talk, fitted for bikes and were on our way. We had three guides, they use the local laneways to get around the majority of the time. This is a fascinating look into how the local people live, especially since you spend a fair bit of time riding past their front door. In the laneways there are also scooters and sometimes cars, but we didn't have a problem negotiating and for the most time they kept out of our way. We visited various temples, the flower market and china town. All of which were interesting.You stop for a rest usually about every 10 to 20 minutes and the majority of road is flat, so it is really never hard going. It was hot on the day we did the tour so riding was better than sitting still at times! We stopped for food and drink, we even stopped for a local snack and drink under a bridge at a local food stand. After a ferry ride home, we honestly felt like we had seen some of Bangkok as the locals do, something as a tourist with young children, you don't often get the chance to do. The kids loved the fish spa and ice cream at the end of a great day. We had a fantastic guide called Ah. I would defiantly recommend this tour! Thank you for giving us a great adventure!"

The guide wasn't as informative as I'd have liked. Also on multiple occasions, he'd tell us to repeat a word in Thai, then laugh at our accent. Kind of annoying. But the company was good. I'd suggest doing a ride outside of the city though."

Something you barely get to see in the overly commercialized \"Glitz and Glamour\" Bangkok. You will encounter many places that you will not necessarily see if you were to do the typical Bangkok must do list or even wonder on your own. The staff of Follow Me tour are extremely helpful, friendly and they provide a holistic and enjoyable service throughout the tour. However i do find their office is a little difficult to find if you follow the map. Easiest way grab a Tuk Tuk or a Taxi to head there.

And there's a surprising amount of it, and I even heard a couple of people get upset as we rode by. It seems like some of the sidewalk riding could take place on the roads in more open sections.However, I will say Peter did a fantastic job of leading a safe ride and showing great knowledge at every stop. When I'm back in Bangkok, I'll definitely book another tour/route with Follow Me. But I'll book (and I recommend this), a private tour so I can stop and go at my own pace and not feel bad about wanting to stop for pictures along the path.

The boat ride was a lot of fun and didn't once feel unsafe. It was like real life temple run once we got into the jungle. We had so much fun cycling through the narrow paths in the swamp. Water and snacks were provided, Ah took pictures regularly throughout the tour, and most of the cycle was in shade so the heat wasn't an issue. This has been the most enjoyable day of our trip so far. I would highly recommend Follow Me Bike Tours and Ah!"

You get to stop at market and also the big sitting Buddha temple. It's a long ride (about 2.5 to 3 hours stoppong at different spots)but it's worth it after eating all morning with the food tour. It rained on us but we still continued to ride so bring a puncho, if you forget to bring one they will provide one for you. A go pro camera would be the idea camera for this."

Going to different temples, biking through back alleys and stopping at various food sites allowed us to see Bangkok in a way that we wouldn't have experienced on our own.Our tour guide was Anh and he took pictures of us throughout the tour which was emailed to us after. The food was great and we got to try some different things. Anh answered all our questions (which was a lot because we were super curious) and we enjoyed his company a lot!I would recommend this to you if you are adventurous!"

We were greeted warmly and the registration process was painless. The safety video was entertaining and short (good thing). We were offered refreshments upon arrival which was very nice as it was a scorcher. We left early since all were present and headed out. Aa pointed out many things to see and took some fantastic photos for us... FOR FREE! We rode through some beautiful and some not-so-beautiful parts of Bangkok, so we truly saw the real Bangkok. For 4 hours we rode, stopped for photos and refreshments, rode, ferried across the river, rode and visited. And to top it off, beers and a foot-fish spa. Those little guys loved chewing my feet! It tickled like crazy! What a great way to spend an afternoon in Bangkok!"

A really cool way to explore Bangkok and experience things you wouldn't normally come across, e.g. a Chinese cemetery where the locals sing karaoke (bizarre!) We did the Siam Chiva food tasting bicycle tour which on the whole was great. Our tour guide was friendly, knowledgeable and very pleasant. Our only feedback is that we found this to be more of a cycle tour (which was excellent) than a food tour. The range of food and drinks on offer wasn't great, especially when you consider all of the wonderful cafes, market stalls and restaurants we passed through. Along the route my friend and I ended up venturing to the stalls independently to explore for different foods and drinks to make sure that we didn't miss out. Aside from that thought I can't complain."

At one point I felt like I was invading people's private space but they smiled back when we said \"sawatee\" , or perhaps they were laughing at us? The guide was very nice and cared for our safety as we navigated some traffic areas. The jungle area was great along with the boat ride. We were tired at the end but easy enough for anyone.Never seen or heard of the tiny \"fish foot cleaning\" thing at the end but it made a great video as my husband screamed like a 10 year old little girl when he first put his feet in.Great activity and would gladly recommend to anyone!"

Unfortunately the next day we got there late because of traffic jam and missed the morning tour. But they offered us at the same moment to take part in the afternoon. It turned out that we were the only ones taking the afternoon tour, which was very nice of them still to offer us the tour as a group tour and not as a privat tour. (We booked the jungle tour)We had a really nice and talkative guide speaking in a good english with a lot of humour during the whole tour. He was driving with us through small streets to see how thai people live and giving us a feeling for the real thailand. After that we headed forward to the green island in the middle of bangkok (also called the green lungs of Bangkok). That was fantastic! It felt like beeing outside any traffic and rumour of the busy city. It was so quiet and green over there.During the tour we got always asked of the tour guide if we'd like to have any snack or water to drink. The water and snacks he payed for us (included in the tour fee).At the beginning and the end we had to cross the busy streets in Bangkok which can be quite dangerous driving a bycicle. But I never felt unsave. Our guide gave us very good instructions and informed us always what will happen next and how to behave on the street.During the whole tour our guide took pictures of us, so we hadn't to use once our camera. I could download the pictures already at the same evening after the tour. A big plus from my side.All togehter it was an amazing experience and I'd love to do another tour with them. But be aware that it's better to know how to drive a bycicle for the jungle tour. There are some points where the street get really tight and on the klong there is no handrail on both sides which can be scary for someone who isn't used to drive a bycicle."

The route was remarkable, in that you travel a good distance but without having to cycle on busy roads apart from one very short stretch. The rest of the time was along sois and alleyways as well as a stretch along a river path. I've been to Chinatown a few times and we still saw some bits I'd never seen before. Perfect biking in a city that isn't renowned for cycle-friendliness. Tremendous value, together with a friendly, fun and informative host. What more could you ask for?"

Our guide Wit was great - always joking, explaining and taking wonderful pictures of our tour! He introduced us to some delicious local food, taught us some Thai and lots of background information - thanks a lot!It really was an adventure to bike through narrow market streets as well as the chaotic Bangkok-traffic. The whole tour was very well organised, even though we came in on short notice and only asked to book the tour the night before. However the team made it possible and we were offered a tour for just the two of us. We felt safe throughout the whole tour, even in the chaotic traffic, Wit was always keeping an eye on us. The bikes were in great condition and drinks were provided. After the tour we got to relax our feet in the clubhouses 'fish spa', which was a new experience for us and the perfect ending to the tour.

We felt very prepared for safety and food items as we took off. We enjoyed seeing the variety of sights from urban landscapes through to the neighborhoods/slums, and across the river to the mangrove forest. We enjoyed the floating market and appreciated the freedom the guide gave us to wander around but still keep us all moving. Winding around country roads was fun and we loved the hundreds of photos our guide took of us and delivered promptly. She was very patient with my 8 year old daughter and took lots of precautions for her safety. We enjoyed their garden and take out lunch after the ride!We were a little surprised at how much surface-street time there was in proportion to time in the forest - the way home, the traffic was pretty intimidating. Also, the trip through the slums was very interesting and we felt safe, but it was a bit of a surprise based on the description we read on line. Here's a blog post I wrote about our trip, including lots of images. http://www.oglesandobservations.com/2015/03/09/bangkok-bike-tour-slums-mangrove-forest-market-city/"

The biking was flat and easy - the heat is the only issue.The flower market (which sounded a bit boring to me) was the highlight.

My girlfriend and I did the night tour with Follow Me Bike Tours and it ended up being just the two of us and the guide, so we got a more intimate session, but it was incredible. We saw many areas we hadn't known existed in Bangkok, as well as learning about the culture, seeing beautiful temples, different districts and getting to experience the real street food!Our tour guide Ah (sorry if this isn't how you spell his name) was friendly, helpful and answered any questions we had. He also made sure we had enough food for dinner and enough water during the bike ride, while also taking lots of photos throughout the whole night (Which were promptly sent to us within a few days)!If you want to see Bangkok, this tour is definitely a great choice."

The best way to get to know Bangkok it through cycling through the little streets. Most of all I enjoyed the night tour, were I had the best Pad Thai in my life (in Chinatown).Thanks again to the team! Best wishes from Germany, Lena"

My husband and I booked the Siam Sawan bike tour upon a friend's recommendation and it was by far the highlight of our short stay in Bangkok last December. Our tour guide (whose name I have sadly forgotten) was fabulous and with him we were able to see a great deal of Bangkok in a way that we never would have done on our own. We biked through narrow back alleys, neighborhoods, through a local wet market, and even through a temple! We were taken care of the whole time and provided with enough water/drinks to keep us going - our guide was thoughtful to stop on a number of occasions to grab us fresh fruit snacks and cool drinks. And on top of everything, our guide was snapping hundreds of pictures of us while navigating through the city. Was a real treat to come home to over 100 pictures that we didn't have to worry about taking ourselves. I highly recommend Follow Me Bike Tours."

The tour duration was 6 hours through the whole tour Aa explained to us a lot fascinating facts about the Thai history, Buddhism and the Thai Cuisine. and also took lovely photos of us during the trip that were sent to us the day after.The tour was so exciting, we went through so many small alleys and streets (if you can call it streets), places you can never reach unless you're local and know very well all the small turns and curves. we visited many temples at night time with it special lighting -when its almost empty from visitors. we had a wonderful local dinner at the Chinese market. we visited the 24/7 flowers market and took the ferry with the bikes. and for the top ending we had some kind of rice whiskey shot with locals in a very small booth on our way back.Really unforgettable experience! thank you so much Aa! hope to visit soon again:))Liron & Asaf"

The company's website is very informative and lived up to its promises. Our guide was very helpful and made the whole experience interesting and informative. We cycled through the narrow paths of Khlong Toei slums, greeted warmly by everyone we passed, and stopped briefly to visit an elementary school, where the children were practising their meditation songs. Two longtail boats - one for cyclists, one for the bikes - took us across the Chao Phraya to the Phra Padaeng peninsula. The narrow cycle paths were a bit too narrow for my comfort but everyone else seemed fine with them and were patient with me when I slowed to a crawl at times. The scenery in the coconut plantations was beautiful though. Then we were out on wider paths in the park, stopping to feed the fish in the lake. Back across the river and onto the busier streets again, we stopped to visit a traditional teakwood house - a calm oasis, incongruously set among the city's buildings. 10 minutes later, we were back at the clubhouse, eating fresh fruit and cooling our feet off in the fish spa. Very worthwhile trip, well organised and efficient - and we really appreciated the free link to photographs taken along the way."

After the tour ends at the clubhouse, there is a free fish spa for your feet and there is complimentary coffee and tea at the clubhouse for you to relax. Or you could play with the resident parrot. I strongly recommend this to anyone coming to Bangkok."

The guide was really good, knows his stuff and explaining everything.the ride in outside of BKK was awesome, safer and more interesting. It took a while to go out of the city, however, riding in the city was not bad :)We visited a museum, kinder garden, coconut farm, fed the fish and went into a boat.this was my best day in BKKIf you ride abike in BKK you can ride anywhere else."

We went through the village to the pier to set over to the green area of Bangkok and to a local market, with a longtailboat. We also drove through plantations and visited a park.It was all very well, but the guide really only guided us through the tour, we didn't get much information about the culture or the daily life of the people, neither background information to places we visit.That i really found disappointing and was a shame, because that really would have made a big different.

After a disappointing morning with another bike tour company (read my other review), I was delighted to join this bike tour.They were helpful and efficient from the first phone call, to directions, to coming out to the main road to meet me when I wasn't sure how to get to their place.And having been on a number of bike tours before, I immediately felt I was in good hands.\u2022 Ms Peach, the local guide was great! Well spoken, friendly, knowledgeable, she led the group well, never once slacking with the signals and safety of the group.\u2022 The equipment was well maintained and in excellent condition. A sign of a well runned company.\u2022 We were provided with food and drink throughout the 4+ hours of the trip, including sampling local fare at the stalls of the canal market.\u2022 The first part took us through lovely backstreets and then through neighborhoods which we would never have seen as a visitor, including some fascinating slums, the ghetto of rural migrant workers and families in the Chong Nonsi area near the river.\u2022 Then the magic of a boat ride across the river, to a completely different world, taking mere minutes. To the eastern shore of that kidney shaped 'island' which is home to Bang Nam Phueng 'Floating' Market. (It's actually more of a market alongside the canals). There, the ride through communities resident amidst the mangrove swamp, past mini farming plots, raised on mounds above the water line of brackish river water, along narrow raised pathways, is both interesting and refreshing as the hustle and bustle of Bangkok rapidly fade away. The sights, sounds and smells assail your senses - especially the smell!\u2022 The stop at the Bang Nam Phueng 'Floating' Market was fun. Happens only on Saturdays and Sundays, it was devoid of tourist at about 3:00 pm. Excellent! Our guide took us through and explained stuff, and bought whatever food and drink we wanted to sample or try!\u2022 Then onwards to the eastern shore of the island to check out some cool hotels (4000 baht/night), quaint homestays (400 baht/night), and finally through some lovely trails before heading back. Another boatride and a 15 min ride back to the starting point.\u2022 The ride finished with more drinks, fresh fruit and promises to email photos taken during the ride by the guide.I'm looking forward to the new tours in development that they mentioned. I will certainly be looking forward to joining them again for those.High recommended!!!!"

Trust me I have a car here and as I wizz by things I always wish I could stop and explore. On a bike you can do just that, and with a knowledgeable guide who speaks both English and Thai you can find new nooks in crannies you never knew existed whether you live in or are just visiting Bangkok. After going on the Siam Boran tour I had a renewed sense of bravery and tried to tackle touring Bangkok's Green Lung on my own. Boy was that a bad idea, I should have signed up for a 2nd tour doing the Siam Sawan route and discovered it with Follow Me Bike Tour's expert assistance. My girlfriend and I got lost riding bikes through the island, and the longtail boat driver almost dropped my bike into the river. Luckily all that was lost was my blinking reflector light, which surprisingly floated in the water.Next time I want to venture out into the wilds of Bangkok for a long bike ride you can bet it will be with the great folks at Follow Me Bike Tours. As an added bonus they even emailed out pictures the tour guide took of the group during the tour."

With bike tour,we been to many small soi or narrow street,which we wouldn't have seen on our own as a tourist. This part was really interesting and fun!The guide also led us to some attractions and gave detailed description of places and histories. Besides that, the guide had stopped twice to buy us some drinks from street vendors.The orange juice was really good and refreshing! Biking for four hours was not tired actually but exercise made us hungry. I would suggest the guide to prepare some snacks on the way(maybe small packaged cookies or cakes) to give the guest. It would be more thoughtful. Overall, I think this is a good experience and fun way to know more about a city. Worth a try!"

We got to see parts of Bangkok that we would never have experienced otherwise. This tour gets you away from the tourists and provides great variety from a nearly empty pagoda to a Chinese temple, street food, long boat ride. It covered so much ground and was totally worth the time and money. Peach was awesome. I admire her for quitting her office day job to do something she enjoys. It comes through. While you wouldn't think Bangkok is a bike friendly city,we took back streets and secret passageways to get around and in the meantime got a glimpse of daily life in some under served areas of the city. It was humbling to see all aspects of the city, not just the sexier tourist areas. Thanks Peach!!"

            "review": "Great way to see another side of Bangkok.. My wife and I often take bike tours when we travel to other cities and so eagerly looked forward to taking the Siam Boram tour given the great reviews of tripadvisor. Indeed, our experience was similar to others. It was a great way to see another side of Bangkok as we weaved in and out of narrow streets along with occasional forays on the main roads where you are literally a couple of feet away from motorbikes, cars and tuk tuks. The whole ride was never too strenuous physically as Bangkok is more or less flat so there were so steep areas to negotiate and I never had to use the lower hears, though occasionally we had to carry the bikes on and off the ferryboats and some steps. Our guide Matthew was very professional and took great care of our group of 10. There were stops in the flower market, Chinese temple and Thai temple, among others. At all the stops Matthew explained the history and taught us a lot about Thai culture. He also took photos throughout and the photos were uploaded soon afterwards. When we got back we were also treated to ice cream! Overall, a great experience.I would rate the tour 4 and a half stars rather than 5 as there are still some areas for improvements. The biggest negative is that you never get a sense of where you have been to as no route map is provided. Granted, you cycle pass temples, Chinatown and the Muslim neighborhoods, but in the bigger picture l did not know where all the locations are situated in relation to each other. On a similar bike tour we took in Montreal we were given a simple map that shows the route map and all the locations we passed by. This simple addition will enhance the experience. Another thing mentioned in a previous review was the quality of some of the bikes. They seem to vary as l saw a mixture of new and old looking bikes, so you should choose your bike carefully before setting out."

As a family of three (aged 58, 25 & 26) we did the Siam Boran Tour and loved every minute of it! Our guide was very informative and the bikes were in great condition. We were even given the option of a large comfortable seat which at the end of the day prevented a sore bum after a long day of cycling round the city! Weaving through alleyways and along side the chaotic traffic of Chinatown was exhilarating, and although I felt 100% safe with the guidance of our guide I would recommend making sure your confident in cycling a bike before taking on this tour! If you want to see the real Bangkok do yourself a favour and book this tour!"

            "review": "Professional bike tour with the dazzling Peach. Did the Siam Sawan (Jungle) tour on Xmas Day. Loved the city bits. Riding through what looks like chaos to an outsider was great fun and felt, to my surprise, completely safe. The jungle bits were relaxing (if not idyllic), so much so that i felt myself nearly drifting off to sleep whilst riding! Enjoyed the boat rides to and from the jungle, and the visit to the ex- PM's house was very good. But for anyone who hasnt seen the historical sights of Bkk, i would recommend doing a city tour first.The general setup up and welcome is excellent - a good induction video which some other providers don't do, and we were tended to with cold drinks before, during and after the tour.For anyone who is cautious about riding a bike in Bkk, don't be. It is by far the most enjoyable and effective way of travelling round the city, and with a local tour guide, nothing could be easier. You willl need a little bit of riding skill as some paths can be narrow. But, to be honest, most people have learnt how to ride a bike well when they were kids, and you don't forget. The beauty with cycling in Bkk is that there is always a cooling breeze, and whilst it will still be hot, you will feel comfortable.Probably my only criticism, and it's a small one, is that the bikes are not high spec. Whilst they are fit for purpose and they get you round at the sedate pace of the tour, they are not as good as some i have ridden with other companies. Its a small complaint and not enough to detract from a great day out.Just have to say that the highlight of this tour was actually a person. The incredible Peach! A tiny, gracious and softly spoken young Thai woman, with an ability to stop large trucks with a polite but authoritative hand in the air and her beaming smile. It must be stressful leading a group of strangers through the roads of Bkk, but she never once lost her calm or authority. She kept me dazzled and entertained all day. Her commentary was interesting and heartfelt, and she clearly enjoys her job. I would follow Peach anywhere, that's how amazing she is."

Once we decanted onto a boat and did a short hop to the island we were in the middle of a beautiful national park!

Having done previous bike tours in Germany (Berlin and Munich) we expected something similar (leisurely biking on beach cruisers to see historical buildings, end with beer). Not so! This tour starts by taking you through the busy streets of Bangkok, including the narrow alleyways of the \"economically diverse\" parts of town, which is an experience in itself. You then take a long boat ride across the river to the island and bike around beautiful jungle scenery. This tour is more physically demanding than the others we have done. When they say 4 hours, they mean you bike for nearly 4 hours straight. This tour was very well run and honestly one of the coolest things we have done. We can now say we gave biked through the hectic streets of Bangkok, something we now know we could NEVER do on our own, despite our previous misconceptions/illusions of grandeur.Thanks Follow Me! for a memorable experience."

Right from the time we started from the Follow Me club house to the time we got back (a stretch of 22 kms which took around 4 hrs+), he managed to take us through what we thought we could not have experienced in any other way.Bangkok has its glamor and shopping and malls, but it also has its quaint little streets, small residential areas and super colorful wholesale markets. At times on the main roads meandering throught the traffic and at others going through streets so narrow that if someone came against you, you'd have to hug one of the walls to let him pass - Siam Boran is a tour for every first time visitor to Bangkok to experience the city first-hand.They even got our tired bunch yummy Thai food and drinks at the end of the tour!Highly recommended for anyone who knows how to cycle."

Our guide was great, and took us through alley ways and back streets as well as through china town and the middle of a flower market and then onto Wat Arun. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants to see a little more than the typical tourist route. Maybe let your guide know if you would like to stop to take extra photos along the way, as we kept a pretty good pace, and looking back I missed out a little on that.All in all, fantastic."

It started with a little urban tour in Bangkok, than we went trough some \"slams\" of the city, stopped at a local little school, tip: take some sweets with you, to give to the children over there, they will be very thankful ! Later we took a little boat to the other side of the river, and biked trough a kind of jungle,very green, very quiet & very nice! We also stopped at the oldest salt factory of the town & we visit an old house of a former prime minister of Thailand ! Overall it is a very safe tour & you will see another side of Bangkok!"

We cycled through the back streets and main streets of a variety of areas in Bangkok, including markets, Wats, Chinatown, rode the local ferries and ate bugs (optional of course).Our local guide (Wit), spoke excellent English and went the extra mile to ensure that we enjoyed the trip. Be open to new experiences - eat the silk worms, grasshoppers and crickets at the markets - they are actually quite nice. They have been marinated and cooked so well if you didn't look at them, you could believe they are anything! If you want to get off the beaten track and see things you wouldn't otherwise see, I couldn't recommend this more highly. It was a hot day, but the ride itself is not all that strenuous, and I actually found it cooler on the bike than walking on the street. After the tour we enjoyed (almost - it does tickle) the added bonus of the fish spa and a viewing of the photos taken by our guide (which were promptly emailed to us after the tour).Enjoy!! It was the highlight of our trip so far!"

It was a truely fantastic experience! Although I have been to Bangkok many times previously for business, the tour afforded me the opportunity to experience Bangkok in new and fascinating ways. And for what you get, the price of this tour is a bargain!I took the food tour with Mod as our guide. She was great - not only explaining about the different dishes we sampled, but also about offering interesting insights into local Thai culture. She was very engaged with the tour group, and went out of her way to converse, teach, and guide, and to interact with us. We learned not only about the food, but also about the restaurants/shops, as well as their owners. In all, we tried 16 different items - all of which were unspeakably delicious! By taking the tour, I was able to stop in to many small restaurants I previously walked by and was able to expand my love of Thai food - and my sense of adventure. Matthew was our guide for the afternoon bicycle tour. He also did an excellent job of teaching and guiding. By taking bicycles through narrow, unbusy side streets, I saw a different side of Bangkok than what you see from the main streets. It was a fascinating and educational experience. We saw some really interesting things - a festival in Chinatown, the flower market, and a temple but we also did some interesting things, such as opening a lotus flower. The ride was not overly demanding physically but the exercise was nice - after a week of meetings and inactivity, the bike tour was just what I needed!The fish spa for my feet at the end of the tour was a nice bonus treat - i was my first such experience, and it was nice to have it included as part of the tour. The Follow Me company was also quick to send a link to the photos from the trip.I have taken several bicycle tours (Beijing, Vienna, Tokyo), but this was my favorite - I reecommend it highly, but be sure to do the food tour as well!"

This tour would have been easily manageable with kids of any age if Follow Me were to supply adequate seats and acquire helmets of better standard."

We were taken to 5 different restaurants/cafe/bakeries with the opportunity to try 14 different Thai dishes that ranged from the Northeast to the South. Our guide was a friendly girl who spoke good English and had intimate knowledge of the history of the district. Then she took us to the bike tour hq to get our afternoon session started. After the safety video was shown, we were fitted to the bikes and then we went off to places where no tourists were. We were taken to a beautiful temple which was in a local village, the flower market, the fruit market, hopped on the ferry to go across the Chao Phraya river, cycled through small villages, went along in Chinatown, cycled alongside the river and taught to fold lotus flowers. Our guide Matthew spoke really good English and had answers to all our curious questions."

Bangkokians are well atune to traffic of all sorts and staying out of trouble was as easy as keeping left and keeping my eyes open.The guide (Loya) was very friendly and informative, and took us to see some fantastic temples and other sites. The main attractions (for me) were the food/flower market and crossing the Chao Praya river by ferry.

Have you ever thought that just because you've been to the Grand Palace, mega shopping malls, and all the tourist temples that you've seen it all. Well, you haven't unless you take a bike tour around Bangkok. There are different tours/routes to choose from. I was able to do the Siam Boran tour today with the afternoon schedule at 1:30/1300. As you arrive to the club house, you're greeted by the friendly staff and your guide. I arrived early just to be sure I was in the right area. Luckily a motor bike was able to take me since taxi drivers don't care to find a spot in the alley ways. Before starting, water, tea, and coffee are provided for you. There's a safety demonstration shown before pedaling out into the city. You'll receive a hat as a souvenir that you can wear during the tour so that the guide can easily spot you. Understandable to the heat, it's not offensive if you decide not to wear it. The establishment is clean, the staff speak english and are really friendly which is always a great thing. We had Matthew as our friendly guide with great knowledge about the history of Thailand and Bangkok. If you have any questions you need or want to ask, don't be shy. Matthew seemed very happy to answer any questions. Here are some tips for the Siam Boran tour: *You're going to wish you had a Go Pro camera or a camera mount. I had to take my camera out a few times to shoot footage or take photos. *If you know you're going to be hungry, order food before taking off that way it's there when you return. Other than that, you can be the nice one and buy food for your group while you're out and about. *In China Town or The Flower Market, if you know what you want without holding up the group, get it. I got a huge bag of goji berries for $9 versus a small 2oz bag in Vegas for $9. I have to say this is about a pound of berries I got. *There was no dress code for the temples we went into, however ask before going to the meeting point incase you may want to bring an article of clothing to wear to the appropriate areas. *Use the bathroom before you leave. I'm sure it'd be hard to find a restroom while on tour. *Everyone seemed to have a standard bike seat while Matthew had a padded seat :)...anyway, if you're planning your trip way ahead, purchase a seat pad before taking on the tour (not provided by the tour). *The tour takes last minute reservations/bookings, so don't bum about how you weren't able to get a tour. More than likely you'll get scheduled into one. *If you're searching for the place prior, don't worry about it, they'll send you a map with your confirmation for walking, taxi, or public transportation. Enjoy!"

The guides are awesome very informative, not only do you get an excellent bike ride but you learn something on the way. I learnt why the Thai people are so peaceful, because they allow each other to have their own beliefs. I learnt this from the guide taking us to different religious areas along the tour.We felt very safe even along very busy roads, we were supplied with water bottles and even some light snacks as we went.I would highly recommend this tour if you want to see what Bangkok has to offer.Their office/starting point can be a little tricky to find so allow a bit of time for your taxi or tuk tuk driver to work it out."

We had an incredible time, seeing a good cross-section of close-together attractions, and the guide was very helpful and knowledgeable - he gave us food, made sure we never ran out of water, fixed my bike when it broke, knew the route, kept us safe on the roads, and knew everything we could have wanted to know about the sights we visited.Not recommended for nervous cyclists, as the roads in Bangkok really are terrifying, but the guide was very understanding and there were only a couple of brief stretches on very main roads. Helmets aren't compulsory but they do supply them if you ask, and I would definitely recommend doing that.The guide took photos for us during the trip, which was also helpful as it allowed us to concentrate on the experience (and cycling safely!) without getting distracted by trying to document it.At the end, there was the option of a fish foot spa, which was ticklish and strange, but which I'd recommend just to say you've done it. They also do food, but I think you have to let them know you want lunch /before/ your tour starts. At the end of ours, though, we asked where we could get food and were directed to a very good, very cheap, outdoors but under-cover local food court, which I would definitely recommend asking after as I got a really great Pad Thai there."

The bikes are very comfy with big tyres and big comfy saddles, and the pace was gentle. Furthermore, as you pass down many narrow alleys and squeeze between buildings you are well shaded, and your pace creates some breeze. It might have been nice to stop at a couple more places of interest - we saw 5 over the 4 or so hours, with most of the rest of the time trundling inbetween, but to be fair to the company the offer is on the table to include more stops if somewhere particularly interests you. It certainly was interesting travelling down alleys and backstreets, to see things you'd never find on your own, and the guide was very nice and knew his stuff. I was amazed at how we zigged and zagged from one tiny street to the next sometimes through unlikely-seeming portals - I have to say I don't know the ins and outs of my home city as well as he knows his!Overall, a very enjoyable way to spend a morning."

We rode through lots of neat narrow streets that are impossible to reach by car/tuktuk. It was a great experience driving through all these places you can only reach on a bicycle. We stopped for some delicious mango and sticky rice, went on to visit an enormous inside flower market, some temples, Chinatown, and we crossed the river a couple of times by ferry. Our tour guide was a great guy; friendly, knowledgeable and also interested in the people in the group. Back at the clubhouse we stayed for a chat and went home after a great but tiring day.I truly believe that this is one of the best ways to get to know Bangkok, and would recommend this trip anyone.

We went through tiny, narrow residential streets and on to Bangkok's 'green lung' island (Prapadeang) by boat. Riding on the raised concrete roads through this virtual jungle in the heart of one of southeast Asia's biggest cities was an incredible experience. The guide truly made this tour though, he spoke fantastic English and was informative and yet amusing too, he felt more like a friend than a guide, even asking us to teach him some English slang words and teaching us some Thai too. The guide buys you all the drinks you want during the tour (which on a day like ours was a lot) and even some local snacks too that were interesting to try, he also bought fish food to feed the seemingly thousands of fish in the lake on the island which is a phenomenal spectacle. The guide is also forever taking pictures throughout the ride which Follow Me Tours then send you via email for free.

The tour was a Sunday morning, which is ideal in terms of there being little foot and car traffic, and for the weather, which is cooler early in the day at this time of year. This tour is a fantastic break from walking around temples and markets. My shoes, that normally are comfortable back home, turned nasty on me and left me with big blisters. Spending half a day cycling and then a fish spa (included in tour) was a welcome change.I found the cycling fairly easy though I don't cycle regularly at home (except spin classes, which don't count). The riding isn't overly fast so you don't really exert yourself. The route went along the river so there were plenty of cool breezes and amongst the buildings plenty of shade.A good sense of balance helps as the route can be over lumpy ground and on a few busy roads. Mostly it is back streets, which can be narrow, low and shared with motorbikes and pedestrians. Your guide will warn you of oncoming traffic or overhead hazards, so by the end of the tour you'll be surprised how much extra bike confidence you develop. The guide took pictures for us along the way, including when we passed other famous attractions such as Wat Arun and Khao San Rd. The route took us past some soldiers guarding the central post office building and our guide suggested we get pictures with them! At no point did I feel unsafe, the pictures later showed the soldier I posed with even had a slight cheeky smile!!Ray (the owner) is great and the bikes comfortable. The bikes have big comfortable seats and small phone and camera pouches.Tip: DO NOT WEAR A WHITE TOP. You will definitely ride through puddles of muddy water at some point...which sprays up onto your back from the back wheel."

I'm so glad I did this! Everyone at this company is great! I asked for somethings to do via chat the day before, and was recommended the Jim Thompson House, which was also fantastic! And they helped me find a cooking school to attend!! This is not a super intense ride, very relaxed pace, even though some of the area's are quite hectic, but you would never see these area's without this tour! You get to see how Chinese-Thai's live, where they work, the old city, wat's (temples), schools, a ferry ride, flower market, and much much more!! I'm so glad I did this!!! Thank you!!"

She took over 70 photos of my experience, took me around Wat Arun (which was not a part of the itinerary, but at my request), all on top of the actual tour!The tour itself consisted of biking in the alleys/hidden streets in Bangkok, visiting the Chinese Market, Flower Market and crossing the river twice via boat. It was an amazing experience and I highly recommend the tour.Only note here would be, make sure you are a good biker and not afraid of the Bangkok traffic. The tour does it's best to keep you in quieter areas, but it is Bangkok after all and traffic and chaos is not entirely avoidable."

I highly recommend it. Our tour stopped at two temples, as well as rode through China town, the flower and vegetable market. Plus you take a river ferry. You do not need to be in fantastic shape, as the terrain is mostly flat. However, I would recommend being comfortable on a bike, as the alleys are quite narrow and traffic a bit daunting. We did the Siam Boran tour. The tour guide, Wynn, was fantastic. Super friendly and knows those alleys inside out. It was impressive because it felt like a maze! Included in the tour are the drinks and snacks at the stops. We stopped twice. The club house (where the tour starts) can be a bit tricky to find but the detailed map provided by the company is great (and a must to find the place). We booked online with ease and the club house is really nice and clean. Be sure to say hi to the mascot, Cracker the parrot. He is really sweet and friendly. The bikes were in good condition and the guide has all sorts of tools to fix anything that would need it during the tour. Our group had 9 people and was a good size. Our tour guide took pictures the whole time and within a day of the trip we received an email with a link to all of them. There is no additional cost for the pictures, a really nice touch. We were able to leave our bags in the clubhouse, in a locked room, with David (the owner, super nice guy!). I am glad I did because it would have been really hot to have my backpack on for four hours in the sun! The bikes did have a little zipper pouch with enough room for sunscreen and a camera. I would highly recommend this tour, it is a wonderful and fun way to see the city."

We live in Bangkok but find we are often confined to the usual expat or tourist areas so this was a great way to see another side of the city we now live in.With hair-raising drives through busy traffic, windy narrow alley ways and then a boat trip to the Green lungs of Bangkok - an island with coconut and banana plantations plus natural waterways and the like - it was a day of pure adventure. On one hand you will see how local people are living - a lot of poverty and struggles but an important eye-opener nevertheless and then you see vast swaths of greenery like you would never expect to see in Bangkok. We stopped at local shops to refresh ourselves and support local business - we appreciated that. The boat ride across the river - well you do get splashed with some of that polluted water but it is all part of the adventure!Our guide Peter, did a fab job of explaining the sites and sounds of Bangkok - all with a great sense of humour. He also took some fabulous photos along the way so we would have something to remember this great day.If you have half a day spare during your visit to Bangkok, we strongly recommend this tour.

This made up a majority of the tour and required great skill in maneuvering around pedestrians, mopeds and the such.I saw most of the old part of the city, including the Flower Market, Chinatown, the Monks Quarter and Wat Arun.

This tour takes you through narrow and crowded sidewalks and alleys, through busy markets, across busy roads where motor vehicles travel at near highway speeds and there are no traffic lights and pedestrian crosswalks, and on ferries across the river. I bumped into a few crates and poles, but through it all, our guide, Lora was professional and managed to keep us alive and safe. We also had great tour mates who looked out for each other and by all indications, everyone had a good time. The bikes were in good shape, the pace was just right, with adequate bathroom and water breaks. At the end of the tour, I felt I deserved a beer for making it through and I enjoyed it while getting a fish pedicure back at the clubhouse \u2013 weird sensation, but cool experience. While some portions of the ride were stressful for me, there were parts that were enjoyable and relaxing, such as shady streets and the bike path along the Chao Phraya River.

You get to see the city more up close than any cab ride can get you.The guy is very friendly but this kind of contributed to the lateness of the group I feel like. The \"tour\" consists of one temple, a flower market, pier, and like 2-3 drink stops. At one point you ride a ferry over the river and back. Kind of sucks having to carry the bike on and off but if you're not fit enough to do that you shouldn't be biking. I enjoyed the tour as it was just an easygoing ride around town. We could have lingered less at stops which would have helped with not going over time so much - you can tell he was a bit nervous at that part. One of my friends actually fell at one point and he had to get his first aid kit out.Oh, they also have the fish that eats the dead skin off your feet - no charge bonus."

We knew as soon as we arrived at the tour office and began viewing their introductory video that we were in for a good time. The purpose of the very well produced video was to relay safety guidelines, but it was obvious that the company staff who also starred in the video had a great deal of fun making it, and thus the tone for a good time was set.We expected to be joining a small group of eight or ten others, but we were in fact a group of two, so we had our own personal guide, who took us through a number of locations, including the \"lungs of Bangkok\", a massive green jungle that the revered King incorporated in the city's planning decades ago. We spent two hours biking in a jungle scape that left us bewildered that we were actually in the centre of a city of twelve million.Our guide also took us through a number of city markets, a former Prime Minister's residence, and the narrow winding pathways through one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Bangkok, where the cleanliness of the district was surpassed only by the friendliness of the residents there. And of course, we couldn't do all of this without navigating our way through a few city blocks of chaotic Bangkok traffic and some wicked intersections - something I still have a little trouble believing we actually did and survived!The bikes were new and all equipment was in excellent shape, our tour included stops along the way where all beverages and food was included, and at the end we were treated to a free fish spa to unwind. The \"Green Tour / Lungs of Bangkok\" was only one of three tour themes to select from, the others being a historical tour of the city, and a gastronomical tour. Perhaps on our next visit we will select another theme and do it all over again. We often take part in cycling tours in our travels, and have done so in Jamaica, Vietnam, and Bali to name a few, but this is the first time we biked in the middle of an enormous city. Follow Me Bike Tours is a world class biking company that gave us the opportunity to explore this city and see things we had never seen before, yet had us feeling safe, thoroughly engaged, and in good hands the entire time. Do yourself a favour and add this activity to your \"must do\" list when you are next in Bangkok."

A few specific points outlined:1) Route was excellent, you get enthralled by the authenticity of the city and flavour. I lost count of the number of kids who high fived us as we went around2) Guide - was amazing, knowledgeable and sincere. She genuinely inquired after each person, and ensured they were shown around and explained what was happening.

No short cuts anywhere and a personalised service.4) Bikes - the bikes are robust city bikes perfect for the route.

The most difficult part of riding a bike in Bangkok is of course getting over the fear of passing intensive road traffic, go through narrow streets with lots of pedestrians, and not hitting things placed on or hanging over the street like BBQ stoves, canopy supports, pots of boiling oil. Of course you will face this kind of danger even walking on the streets in Bangkok. So, it is no big deal. However, the trip is certainly not for people who just learned cycling or not confident riding on the street. I would not recommend any kids who are under the age of 12 joining the backstreet tour. However, I need to repeat that it was great fun. I will definitely do another bike tour when I visit Bangkok again. BTW, the physical demand was not great."

The food tour takes you to several local restaurants the oldest district in town; hidden gems off the beaten track, with a variety of food (Chinese, eastern Thai, Thai-style halal/muslim, and royal-court style cuisine) that\u2019s very filling and diverse. My favorite dish was \u201cyam pla duk fu\u201d, a unique deep-fried concoction of shredded fish and bread crumbs and peanuts. The bike tour is a fast-paced adventure through the alleys and streets of the old neighborhoods, and you get to see how the local people live. The tour includes a visit to Wat Arun and another local temple with one of the largest Buddha images in the country. And I learned how to make lotus flower offerings, which served me well when I later visited Wat Pho! It be helpful for you to have some prior experience cycling on the streets before doing the bike tour (and the tour website mentions this too). None of the roads we passed were very busy or dangerous, but we did pass through some small alleyways and crowded areas. So you'll want to have some confidence.

One thing to point out though although you do not need to have competed in the Tour De France! you do need to have a reasonable level of competency on a bike and have a reasonable level of fitness as you do cover quite a distance in very warm conditions through alley ways, markets and much more. However what you are rewarded with is seeing and smelling the real Bangkok close up, it was a marvellous experience something that we will remain in our memory for a very long time, our guide Tom was excellent and at no time did we feel at risk or in any danger.If you have a little spirit of adventure and want to get away from the usual tourist track then consider this different way of seeing this mad city.Thanks to all at follow me for a great day we will certainly try another of your tours if we come back to Bangkok."

We did food tours in other cities and thought it would be great to do this in Bangkok. We were not disappointed. My husband emailed Follow Me and they confirmed our reservation and notified us to pay the morning of our tour. Our food tour guide Apple was nice and talked about all the different types of food we would try before we ate it. The portions were generous and everything was delicious expect the goat liver. After the food tour we did a bike tour, which I am so happy we did so we could work off all the food we ate. I had injured my foot prior and the staff was very helpful. I can honestly say we wouldn\u2019t have gone to the destinations we visited on our own but I am happy we did. Riding through alleys were locals live was exciting and it was nice to see all the kids waving and saying hello as you rode by. We ended up taking the bikes across the river on a ferry, ride by the park and watch the locals play, and see how people live. I am so happy we did this; it was a fun and memorable day."

The afternoon on the bikes was spent with our guide Peter who was extremely friendly & humorous. The tour included lots of backstreets and narrow lanes which were full of locals with the biggest smiles! Truly a fantastic experience in itself. We then took in lots of markets, river crossing and some amazing temples. The biking was all flat so not too exhausting, but some dicey areas on the busy main roads at times...all part of the fun though! I felt the only thing that could be improved on was that I would have liked to hear more facts & history about the sites we were taking in. Overall though we had a truly memorable day & met some fantastic people. Our guide took pictures all day and then sent us the Facebook link afterwards...a really nice touch. Thanks again Peter! What a day!"

I've seen all the major sites so the back alleyways was appealing and there isn't any uphill biking, but it's certainly not an easy ride! Most of the tour is very much off the beaten path and as many reviews explain, through very narrow alleyways with sharp turns, loads of obstacles like sleeping dogs in your path, kids playing, low laundry, people cooking their lunch in the narrow paths behind homes, garbage, huge steps to take bikes up and down, congested lines to get on the ferry, impossible to move on a bike through Chinatown and the flower market. I liked it, but its NOT easy and good balance, sharp turning skills and quick reflexes needed! Our guide was good, but his English was difficult to understand. I thought it was pretty funny that we would cross a major street with him in the lead blowing a whistle, like that was going to stop traffic or keep us safe. But it all worked out surprisingly well and everyone seemed to have a good time. I'm not sure I would do it again except the last hour which was along the river on a pretty promenade. Upon arrival back to the \"club house\" you can relax, which was nice but then you are left to make your way home and in the winter it's dark by 5:30-6pm, so I wished we had ended a bit earlier. I didn't see a tip box anywhere and I felt that it would have been nice for everyone to give a small tip for the hard working guides at the end which I did but individually. Bikes were well maintained and you have your choice of a mountain bike or regular type. Very good website and excellent pre tour communications. Overall fun, if you are game for a real obstacle course!"

I've done many bike tours in many cities around the world.Follow Me bike tours have really nice guides who go out of their way to be helpful, a relaxing club house and a fish spa for afterwards (weird sensation - little fish nibbling on your feet!!).I'm just not sure that the city is particularly conducive to a bike tour. We spent hours riding around, but I felt like we only saw 3 or 4 major sights and LOTS of time riding through alleys.It's definitely important to see both sides of the city - the major keynote sights + the way normal people live, it just felt a little imbalanced. It may be just due to the fact that there aren't more major sights within cycling distance.We saw a temple, old customs house, Banyan tree, flower market, giant buddha, crossed the river on ferries. There were quite a few food and toilet stops, we even got to eat bugs from a street side stall.It was a good day and I'm glad we did the tour (we did the food tour in the morning), I just felt that in comparison to other cycling tours in other cities there was more riding and less major sights to see.If you have a free day it's still worth doing, and the company does take good care of you."

At first we hesitated as cycling in Bangkok sounds like a suicide attempt! Despite this we decided to go and we do not regret it. Our guide took us through small backstreets in quarters that we would never have experienced without this tour. Our guide, Tob, was very knowledgeable and told us many things about history and culture during the day. As described on the homepage you should be a relatively experienced cyclist as sometimes you need to navigate in very narrow streets and amongst big crowds of people, e.g. In Chinatown.Afterward we relaxed in the cosy garden for a while and enjoyed the free fish spa to refresh our feet.Highly recommended and we'll definitely do it again if/when we return!"

I've visited Bangkok previously and like the big, bustling, friendly city - on this trip we decided to see something different and chose this tour. It's an absolute highlight of our holiday. We saw \"behind the scenes\" Bangkok around alleys that I would have thought never existed. We were cycling by the river, through markets, around temples, on ferries and bridges, down alleys used by locals to get to their houses. One moment we're in the middle of a market and then in a back alley just wide enough for the bikes where locals were just quietly going about their daily business. This felt like Bangkok the way the people live - not the way that tourists usually view it. How they managed to pack that into a few hours I don't know - but if you get the chance you should absolutely take one of their tours. They were easy to deal with before the trip, we had two guides looking after our group, we were safe and well looked after the whole time. The pace of the trip was set by our guide to suit the people on the tour - both guides clearly enjoyed showing off their city to tourists and it was all done in a natural, respectful way. If we go back to Bangkok we will consider doing one of their other tours - that's the best recommendation I could give!"

Well designed tour, perfectly paced, with appropriate number of stops for special sites, well-timed banana and water breaks, and a thrilling ride on comfortable 21-speed city or mountain bikes, through the tiny alleyways of Bangkok's denizens, historic Chinatown, the beautiful Assumption Cathedral (building funded by local Chinese), original custom house (now fire station), largest flower market, Muslim Cemetery, the large and elaborately carved Wat Arun, the intimate Wat Kanlaya Namit (where you can ring the bell), and many other interesting local sites that don't make it into the guide books. I loved our brief encounters with the Thais through the sawadee kha's, the high 5's from children, and Happy New Year's from the adults. Simply a magical experience.Our guides, Ken and Rose, had our safety uppermost in mind. As a result, our tour was limited to 6 participants, with guides at front and back to ensure we stayed together and stayed safe. Lead guide Ken did the narration - his English is functional and could be understood most of the time. A patient and nice fellow. One suggestion - guides might mention when bathroom breaks are planned so that we are drinking enough water without fear of being without a toilet for 2-3 hours.In addition, Ken and Rose were only too willing to take photos with our cameras, constantly offering, and Ken as well took many with the company camera. In fact, Follow Me offers to download their photos taken on the tour onto a USB stick if you bring one. That is a unique and value-added service. As is the fish foot nibble experience offered on return.Tips: our tour was full of quick twists and turns and ups and downs, very narrow lane-ways, uneven and sometimes rutted pavement, so you must be comfortable on a bike to fully enjoy it. In a number of spots, you will need to lift your bike up 2-3 steps and in others, to walk the bike through heavily congested pedestrian areas. No need to being water - this is amply supplied and the bikes have water bottle cages. Wear shorts and decent shoes or teva-type sandals (leave your flip flops at the hotel); hats and helmets (if you want one) are supplied. This tour was the most memorable Bangkok experience we have had so far. Highly recommended."

I just spent a week in Krabi and was bombarded by t-shirt shops, restaurants, pharmacies and travel agencies. However today, I finally got to experience authentic Thai culture. I LOVED everything about the tour from the introduction video to biking through crowded streets and back alleys. We passed so many people who met our group of five with a smile and \"Hello! \" I felt that some people were excited to see a group of non-Thai people exploring their neighborhood and they welcomed us. I never felt like our group and our bikes were a disturbance. Our guide, Tom whose birth name is probably much longer as most Thai names are...What's the long version of Bangkok again, Tom?..was great!! He was the guide I'd be waiting for to share some stories about the history and people of Thailand. He knew those back alleys inside and out and remembered everyone's name. His English was perfect and I had no problem understanding him (some Thais speak with a strong accent). My only suggestion would be knowing the names of the different areas/neighborhoods we biked through. It helps as a reference point if someone were to ask me where I went in Bangkok.The tour itself was well organized. My bike was fine. I loved the pouches that were attached for a camera, wallet, etc. I felt like we had well-timed breaks. We stopped for drinks twice and a delicious snack once. I really enjoyed getting on and off the ferry, just to change things up. Lunch wasn't included but offered for a reasonable price at the clubhouse. Fish spa at the end was weird and fun!!Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this tour if you are the type of tourist who doesn't like touristy things. You'll get some exercise in, too. Thanks Follow Me for making my last day inThailand my best day in Thailand!"

After completion of this part, I was taken by taxi to the Follow Me clubhouse, where the next group was waiting.The bikes were fine and the three (!) guides that accompanied our group were fantastic. They were funny, friendly, laid-back and yet put great emphasis on getting us safely around through tight alleys and sometimes daunting traffic.

Our guide 'Peter' was only too happy to wait for us to get sorted and then take us out for what became a private tour. I just wish we were a little more socially competent given we were the sole attention of the guide. What started quite awkwardly soon settled and Peter turned out to be very funny. He knew a lot about the city though and painted us some vibrant mental pictures as we biked around the hidden alleyways of Bangkok. 4 hours is a decent amount of time to be peddling around Bangkok and seeing the sights so we were happy to arrive back and settle down with the Thai curry take away they picked up for us!

One of the highlights was definitely cycling through the streets and markets (both outdoor and indoor!) of china town. Another highlight is visiting Wat Arun - definitely my favourite temple in Bangkok! Our guide was fantastic and knowledgeable about the places we visited. The cycling is not difficult as Bangkok is very flat. Some of the streets you cycle through are pretty narrow though but that just added to the fun of the trip.

I really enjoyed the trip!A tiny note of caution for families....the trip through the farm area is on raised concrete paths with a 2-5m drop...so if you are nervous about riding a bike...beware!...but for anyone confidant on a bike it is fine"

We had only three of us, and two guides. They we very pleasant, informative and entertaining. We rode through streets, backstreets, alleys, over bridges, stair wells...you name it. Not for the faint of heart....there will be traffic...but your guides will protect you and guide you to stately. There are drink stops along the way, fruit tastings, temples, and of course, a river crossing or two. The 4 hour events ends back where you started, with a nice choice of Thai or BBQ....and the most unusual foot massage ever! Everything was sorted out to our liking. The owner and staff are at your service and willing to help you through every challenge. No worries. Do this tour...you'll love it. Great way to experience Bangkok."

The quaint food shops, the back roads, and the behind-the-scenes view of the city made it very interesting. Not to mention, seeing the place by riding bicycle in the city is an experience on it's own! I didn't realize we had covered so much distance until our guide told us!The tour I took was a walking food tour + a biking tour after. We had the chance to try different unique cuisines local to Bangkok and all places were good. The bike tour took us through the back roads (biking through markets even) which I would never have seen if not for this tour. It was great to have also biked along the Chao Phraya river.We caught a bit of heavy rain but I didn't think that was a big safety concern and to me, it made it even more exciting! It's great value considering the price I paid. The fee covered meals on the food tour, the bike rental, the refreshments along the way, and even a hearty dinner at the end of the day.Even of you consider yourself just a little adventurous (and you have basic skill in riding a bike) I give you my wholehearted recommendation."

Signed up for the bike tour online and it was fast and easy. The directions given were quite comprehensive except for the part where we need to cross the road using the pedestrian bridge.Bicycles given were ok. However, some were better than the other. The route taken was good. We get to cycle through small alleyways, along the river, and through the markets. This is something you won't experience if you visit the normal tourist areas.My gripe is that if the guide was better, the trip will be much better. It didn't start well when he tried to be funny by telling some silly jokes. The website mentioned that we will get to try some street food but all we got was coke and chips. A trained guide will make a world of difference for such tours.For a different experience, I highly recommend the bike tour but do check whether their guides are experience and itinerary."

Don't eat breakfast if you do this tour. Our guide met us at the train station and took us to the bike place when our food tour was done. Was able to relax for a bit before hopping on our brand new bikes complete with new helmets. Peter was our fantastic guide and took very good care of us when it was time to cross the busy streets. We cycled on the streets, in small laneways, through markets and up to the ferries to cross the river three different times. It was thrilling and felt like I was on an episode of amazing race. Plenty of stops for breaks, liquids and toilets. If you like to do things different, like to sweat and get some exercise and just have fun this is the tour for you!"

Very clear instructions and safety advice from our excellent guide and then we were off on our 25km adventure lasting 5 hours. I've been travelling to Bangkok for over 10 years on business but have never been exposed to the multitude of fascinating neighbourhoods, historic buildings, temples and markets that we saw today. Cycling through back streets, main roads, narrow alley ways between densely laid out houses, markets, the occasional main road and travelling across the river on small ferries meant that we were able witness real life in Bangkok. Our guide was extremely attentive, ensuring everyone kept up, providing information on each of the stop off points and in general about Thai culture and religion. He made certain we stopped frequently for drinks, entertained all of as we travelled and took lots of photographs to provide a great record of the day.I'd recommend this adventure to anyone."

After about 15 minutes my daughter, 15, decided she really didn't like it as the traffic was busy and there are lots of motorbikes on the small lanes. No problem, our guide dropped her bike, and my wife's, and they jumped on the sky train to go back. Point to note though is that you should be confident on a bike.My son and I continued and had a fantastic trip. We cycled through the fish and flower markets, down narrow streets and then across the river on the ferry to Wat Arun. Continuing on that side of the river we cycled through parks and down the river side to get a fascinating view of Bangkok. Top, our guide, was very informative and great at ensuring that everybody was ok and had plenty to drink.Once we got back to the clubhouse we had a light lunch and a chance to use the fish spa which was also a good experience.

As a small suggestion: It might me useful to hand out maps at the beginning showing the route that we are taking as you just get completely lost when your guide leads you through all the side streets.

I went out in 32 degrees in the afternoon, our tour guide was amazing we had frequent stops along the way with fresh cold bottled water. Another good feature of the tour is that the guide takes photos along the way, which frees you up to concentrate on cycling through some rather 'interesting' places. Then when you return to the Club house the Follow Me crew offer you a free fish spa and buffet BBQ/Thai dinner.One minor thing that I did not really like was that the photos were made available publicly on facebook. I was not informed that this was the case when they were being taken, only that they would be emailed to us. For privacy reasons, I think maybe it would have been better for them to upload them to a dropbox account or similar and email the link to their guests. Other than that - definitely give this a go if you are in Bangkok, you will have fun. BUT try and go in the morning if you can.Thanks Follow Me Bike Tour - it was great."

The bites part was awesome \u2013 we had 10 different local dishes in places I would never have walked into on my own. Our guide, Nushi, took care of all the group\u2019s needs. She made sure we all had bottled water, and she took special care to be sure that all dietary restrictions were addressed. Our favorites were the authentic green curry with chicken, the fried catfish, and the papaya salad \u2013 YUM! It was particularly well-thought out to have the microphones and headsets. Nushi was very soft-spoken, and Bangkok can be loud, but we heard all her comments loud and clear. We\u2019ll be back.On to the bike tour. Tip - We\u2019d recommend either trying to ensure that you ride only with those you know or have a quick conversation ahead of time. The guides could potentially split groups based on skills \u2013 those that like to go can go, and those that need a bit more time won\u2019t feel rushed. It is an amazing tour, but all the stopping and waiting detracted from being head-over-heals for it. We\u2019ve been on a few rides, and this was particularly slow \u2013 we\u2019re not speed demons. Either way - We got to see the inner city up close and personal. It was awesome! We were very comfortable riding through heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic along with cruising through tight alleys with scooters. It was cool. The sweep did an amazing job of blocking traffic and keeping an eye on everyone, but this is no little stroll down a country lane. You need to be alert. We\u2019d go do the tour again tomorrow! (but we had to go home). Back at the clubhouse - you should at least try dipping your feet in the fish pond for a bit of your own \u201cde-scaling\u201d. It\u2019s a new sensation to say the least. The barbecue provided was nice, and having time to recap cool moments with tour mates was appreciated.It would be unfair to not include our only disappointment. I had a flat. No worries \u2013 it happens. The guides were equipped with a pump, a patch kit, tire tools, and even tubes. The guides kept trying to pump it back up - when pumping it back up was not the solution, we recommended that the guide change the tube. My husband even offered to help. They did not change the tube, so I asked to swap bikes with one of the guides. The guide told me she was too small for my bike and it would only be another HOUR until we were finished. When we pointed out that the sweep was riding a bike of an identical frame size (and my husband got a bit louder) \u2013 they agreed. We were polite, but we had to dig to find out that neither guide knew how to change a tube. Yes, it was a rear tire, but still. My husband offered to change the tube \u2013 and we recommended splitting the group while we did the swap. After a quick switch and taking a few photos of my husband\u2019s greasy paws, we caught back up to the other group. It was another Bangkok experience for us to remember and no big deal in the end. Our disappointment was not with the experience, but the lapse in professionalism / safety precautions. A guide should NEVER ask a client to ride on a flat / leak and all guides should know how to take care of basic needs. We still loved it, and would do it again in a heartbeat, but these are balanced reviews \u2013 and you may not have someone on your ride that can swap a tube in a few minutes."

The tour was professionally organised, the tour guide spoke good english and the whole experience was enjoyable. They even sent us through photos of the tour afterwards - and the free meal and water throughout was a nice touch. The only thing we would say is that we did expect the tour be be more of a \"guided\" tour - and that we might learn a bit more about the places that we were visiting rather than just ride through them. However, that is our thirst to always know more! Thank you."

Back in the U.K. I admit, I'm a bit of a mamil (that's middle aged man in Lycra) and enjoy a bit of road cycling to try and keep fit. So a cycle tour of the back streets of Bangkok sounded like a cool idea. (Especially as my wife was keen too, as there aren't too many hills in the city) Book first, via the interweb thingy as space is limited, and leave a good bit of time to find the place as our taxi driver got lost.  They supply bikes (obviously) and safety equipment, water and two guides who have a fantastic memory for the back streets and alleyways.  Within moments of leaving base I was lost and following the riders in front only occasionally spotting parts of the city I knew. Twisting and turning through alleys and corridors, through markets and workshops, under bridges, along the river, over the river (on a ferry, silly!) a bit like doing the scene in Milan from The Italian job. (Although in Bangkok and on two wheels, and without the bullion.) The tour we were on lasted about four hours, and we were all starving when we got back. Helpfully a barbecue is included in the price and ready and waiting when you get back. (Free fish spa too!) Great value for around 1000 Bhat each"

We had the best time in Bangkok ever,...........Tub took us down back streets, that the average tourist would never venture there, took us to temples, fire station, places you cannot imagine.The riding of the bikes on the main roads in Bangkok was really quite exciting, there's nothing to worry about, you go at a steady pace and as along as your sensible, you will be fine, its not a race, its a fun morning.Everyone was so friendly as we rode around, saying \"good morning etc\"...one of the bits of the tout that took my breath away was that we were riding around, then came through a car lot.........then there was the oldest Chinese temple on the world. now I wasnt expecting that at all.Tub was very easy to get along with, answering questions but also chatting to us too. He was born and bred in bangkok, so he def knew his stuff :-)Plenty of water, drinks etc were provided along the way. yes we were hot and sticky when we finished but we had the best day ever.We returned to lunch, sitting in the coolness of the garden, then a fish spa was a good way to end the day.I would say Ray and his team, have this \"just right\"Well done to you all, we have had the best time ever and if we ever come back to Bangkok, I would def do the tour againThanks againJudy and Joe"

I needn't have worried. Our guide went at a steady pace, guiding us through tricky bits and making sure everyone was comfortable. The other road users are very considerate. I am not an experienced cyclist and so I think even confident beginners would enjoy this tour. The tour goes through back alleys and markets, along the river and utilises the ferry. We saw sites away from the main tourist drag that we would not have seen on our own. Our guide was informative throughout. There are plenty of photo opportunities and rest stops and you are supplied with ample drinking water. About 24 hours after the tour we were emailed photos the guide took of us during the tour. There were some great shots. Only added extra that I would have liked would have been a map of the route, highlighting some of the sites to take away with me.Overall, highly recommended."

The tour consisted of half a day of walking / tasting street food in the city, followed by an afternoon of biking around the congested but colorful streets of the old city. Bangkok is an exciting city and I'm very glad that we signed up for such a tour. We discovered local treasures and also explored the city from a new perspective. Having said that we felt a few things could have been done better:Food tour: The morning exploring food was great and the better part of the day for sure. They told us to show up without eating breakfast. We were hungry when we arrived at the meeting point and it took us another hour before we were guided to the the first tasting So basically until 11 am we had not eaten or drunk anything and had starting getting a headache walking around hungry on the hot streets. This may be ok for some but my friend and I are used to eating a decent breakfast to start the day. Our guide (can't remember her name offhand) was very sweet, informative and friendly. I'd recommend that they either advise us to eat breakfast beforehand, or provide us some munchies to get the morning started. Another bit of false advertising: They told us that we are not required to carry any money as they'll look after food / drinks. Sorry not true We had to buy our own water, coffee etc. We were probably a bit aggravated because we didn't get any food almost until lunch time. Bike tour: The bike tour was fun definitely a great workout. We were unfortunately rushed through busy streets on a hectic schedule and didn't really have time to understand or explore. Plus it was a big group and I think the guide (who was working hard) was over-stretched trying to manage the different skill-levels and having to run off every few minutes looking for folks who had fallen behind. It's great to cover ground but without context or guiding we don't really know what we are seeing. I recommend equipping the guide and the riders with handsets so we can be better informed about what we are visiting. A lot of us could have used a break or two to refuel and recharge, however we didn't appear to have the time to do so. We had a few folks falling off their bikes in the rush to get back ( as it was getting dark). Maybe reduce the length of the tour spending more time at each place (quality over quantity)? After arrival we didn't find the well-anticipated BBQ but were instead asked to order a small thai dish from a takeaway restaurant. No explanations provided. I do recommend the guided food tasting / bike tour as a great way to explore BKK but would urge readers to do their research thoroughly on selecting the right outfitter."

If we didn't join the tour, we wouldn't know and experience the truth of Bangkok. It was a great four hours time spent instead of shopping and eating! Though we were tired. I enjoyed the visit of Flower Wholesale Market, Vegetable Market, Wholesale market, Chao Phraya along the river ride and Wat Arun. Like! Like! Like!"

The tour was superb and felt we saw a lot of Bangkok we wouldn't have otherwise. The clubhouse is an Eden of its own providing a calming oasis in one of Asia's craziest cities. If it wasn't for the bike tour, we feel we wouldn't have seen much of the city."

The bikes were very comfortable and I am not a regular rider but had no trouble. We cycled for about 4 hours it was not too tiring as we had quite a few stops . We were very fortunate that there were only the two of us which meant we cycled at our own pace . The initial part of he ride through Bangkok city traffic was an experience!! Particularly for myself a \" holiday cyclist\" , but our guide was very professional and instructed us very well, you just need to do exactly as he does and don't hesitate. Once we were off the main roads it was different again, cycling on elevated concrete paths through the park and through narrow alleyways in the back streets, there was always something interesting to look at. It is a test fir your coordination and balance but heas of fun. I would say the afternoon we spent on this tour was probably the highlight of our time in bangkok and definitely worth doing ."

The food tour was on foot and we had an excellent guide and enjoyed sampling foods from some great eateries. We were then taken back to base, well-fuelled, to begin our cycle tour. Only three on the tour with a great guide. Cycling in Bangkok is not for the faint hearted but it was great fun, well paced, well organised and a really super way to see life in Bangkok (including some 'off the beaten track' historical sights). We covered a lot of ground, mainly in back streets and alleys. To finish off, dinner is picked up on the way home to eat back at base. Great value and some of my most vivid memories of Bangkok (and I had 10 days there!). Thanks a million guys!"

I was a little concerned about coping with the heat and pace of the tour but this proved to be a very uneccesary worry as the breeze when riding our bikes was very welcome and proved much better than walking around plus the pace was easy to manage with frequent stops at some of the more unusual sights and for refreshments. We went through some very \" off the beaten track \" parts of the city getting some unusual looks from the locals but always followed by a cheery smile and wave. Maybe we were lucky with the group we were with which consisted of a fairly wide age range but I cannot agree with other reviewers that mention that this tour only suits those with experience. The route is flat and easily negotiated, the traffic in some parts was heavy but our guide made sure that we kept safe at all times. Following our trip we had a lovely meal from the local restaurant and a free foot spa to sooth those aching feet."

I did the half day tour with my Wife, who had not been on a bike in a few years, I am quite comfortable on a bike as an avid cyclist and I had a blast. My Wife, not so much. The route we took was far to intense for the average person on a bike, the reviewer that said it was safe for a 4 year old must have had a different route! The other pair on our tour were having about as much fun as my wife.The bikes: I would say that they were probably a little less that 100% safe. The brakes on my bike were far from properly adjusted. The bottom bracket creaked like a rusty door whenever i put a little oomph into the pedals. My wife's bike had smooth tires, which was fine until we rode through, yes through, the fish market! you don't see those pictures on their FB because the guide was more concerned with not hitting any angry locals!All and all I had fun, but as I said I am far from a casual cyclist. This tour would be much more enjoyable if the riders ability and comfort zones were catered too, and perhaps the bikes had a little more maintenance.lunch was provided from a street cart."

Found Follow Me Bike Tours really easily due to an excellent map sent by the Company! Had a warm welcome and a funny intro video to the do's and dont's of cycling in Bangkok, all common sense. We cycled to the home of former PM M.R. Kukrit - really beautiful and very interesting, we were surprised that Jim Thompsons' house appears on all the maps but this one doesn't - so much better and much more interesting and no shop attached! See below for the Itinerary. Our ride leader Tam was amazing - so friendly, informative, helpful and such a nice genuine person, and best of all he took control of that Bangkok traffic! Riding on the roads was fine, thrilling in fact!! It was great to see the villages on stilts that lie across the river. Waving children and smiling and patient [of us!] parents, huge lizzards, tropical vegetation, delicious Pad Thai at a local cafe and cycling all the way made for a great long afternoon. A young man on the trip said 'It's quite intense, isn't it', I was thinking 'challenging'. It's all totally flat, that day the sun was STRONG, also you will need to lift your bike on numerous occasions, the pathways on stilts at time have no walls, and the corners are very tight. For me the Bangkok traffic was nothing, but those tight corners.....! We were a very small group, so it didn't matter. Loved the trip.http://www.followmebiketour.com/cycle-bangkok-siam-sawan-siam-heaven-tour"

It was somewhat of a harrowing ride through the narrow alleys and along the busy streets, but our guide Vincent was able to keep us all together.

Because I was traveling alone I almost booked everyday with a tour and the 'Bike and bite' tour was the best by far. In the morning we met at a central location and went on the food tour where I had the most amazing duck I ever tasted, great curries and to die for pastries. Just don't eat breakfast because you will be doing a lot of eating and you don't want to miss out because you are full. Thereafter we took the bike tour which was just as good if not even better. The tour guide was so friendly and relaxed and explained everything very clearly. The bike tour itself was also great because I got to see Bangkok in a way I would have never seen it without the tour. What I liked about the biking tour is that we took a lot of alleyways and back streets. We got to see the REAL Bangkok and how the locals live and not the commercial one and there wasn't a lot of traffic so I felt safe all the way. The bbq and the fish spa afterwards was also great and overall I just had a wonderful experience. Definitely a great way to spend your day in Bangkok, with great food, friendly people and wonderful sightseeing."

Energy levels had dropped and we were not sure what the afternoon would bring. But we persevered and would say the afternoon was the highlight of the day. Tob looked after us and was full of information. Not to say our morning guide wasn't. We were equipped with headsets so we could follow while she talked. We went to some restaurants we wouldn't have tried as day to day tourists. So this will benefit our next trip to BKK. Food was plenty, water/soft drinks for the bike tour were plenty.

Once we were sufficiently stuffed full of food we headed to the clubhouse to get kitted up for the ride. The bikes are all of a high quality and Tob our guide was professional, informative, gave clear instructions and took heaps of awesome pics! My favourite aspect of the tour was simply riding around the narrow alleys and backstreets (there's so many pot holes, tight corners and traffic to contend with which we found so exciting haha!). The Thai people wave and yell p as you ride along, we had local kids follow us for a bit. It felt like a really authentic experience :) also enjoyed stopping by the markets and temples too.I would note that Bangkok is a big busy city and although the tour is mostly through the side streets which don't have heaps of traffic, at times you will ride on mains roads and through narrow markets so if you know how to handle a bike you will have a more enjoyable time! ;-) enjoy."

Bangkok is very busy with heavy traffic and some air pollution. It is hot. The tour mostly kept to side streets, alleys, narrow foot paths where traffic was not a problem. It also was maybe 5% on busy roads. A lot of it was riding through narrow market streets and stalls where we should not have ridden IMO. These negatives are also pluses as this is the soul of Bangkok. Some of the route was near and through temple grounds and along the river. Very nice. The price is fair and included a terrific lunch back at the stable. (Note: We are old but fit seniors) Recommended. In summary DO IT."

I joined Follow Me tour at Bangkok and the guide showed me especially where the local people live, which made me remember the memory when I was at elementary school and I ran around narrow, curbed, and tricky road where the adult usually passed through. I had quite memorable experience with his guide, for example, at the area where catholic missionary helped to built, when we passed by the people and greeted them in Thai language, they greeted back to us, the guide showed his favorite stands and gave me snacks or sweets, and so on.It was so adventurous but worth trying to ride on a bike and run around the chaotic roads at Bangkok. In addition, he took special care of us and watched out the roads with hand signal or by noticing when we ran across or along the main road with busy traffic."

We just got back to our hotel after a great day!We did the full day Food & Bike tour - definitely recommended!The food tour was fantastic and our tour-guide Lucy(?) was great!! We walked around a great area with tons of little restaurants and cafes. Leave your doubts at home and just sample it all! It was all delicious and the tourguide provides headsets, so you can hear whether you're near or far! We will definitely be heading back to taste some more of the menus at the places we stopped at....The bike tour was something else, Bangkok is usually hectic from the safety of a taxi, skytrain or tuk-tuk, just imagine it up close and personal on a bike! We were guided through some narrow (read very narrow) alleyways and around the inner city, it was a fun time for sure, but need to have your wits about you at all times!! Lots of stops and drinks along the way, but its 5 hours of biking, so be prepared (flip flops not recimmended!!) and loose comfy clothing that you're ok with gettin a little sticky!I would recommend to friends, family and all others and would do it again for sure!"

You see a large amount of Bangkok in a short amount of time, but you see Bangkok in a special way not seen by the tourists traipsing through the Grand Palace and Wat Pho. You experience residential alleyways and the true nature of Bangkok known to residents. Tob, our guide, was fantastic. He took over 40 pictures and emailed them to us. The only challenge with Follow Me is locating their shop. Be sure to print out the directions; they are tucked in a back alley."

It's something that most tourists would not be exposed to. Along the way we experienced the daily lives of local folks who would exchange friendly greetings with you. We enjoyed window shopping as we cycled through the bustling streets of Yaowarat (Chinatown), and into the flower and vegetable markets. The tour also brought us to some lesser known but equally fascinating temples (and a church too!), away from the usual ones that are packed with tourists. Our guide, Tob is tops! He took good care of us, making sure we are well-hydrated during the breaks. At temple stops, he would relate to us the awesome histories behind these holy places. On the side note, Tob is great with kids. Daisy, the little girl in our group loved to hold his hands; her daddy felt left out...ha ha! The tour was fun yet challenging, especially when negotiating some of the narrow alleys and the numerous big and small humps throughout the journey. Fortunately, the bikes are well-maintained and equipped with good suspensions which made the ride more forgiving to my bum. This excellent bike tour is the highlight of my Bangkok trip. Try them and you know why."

As there were cancellations I was the only person that turned up for the tour but the company was good to its word and sent me out on a comfortable touring bike with an excellent local guide. The tour brought me along many narrow back alleys, into slum areas, wet market / flower market, across the Chao Phrya river on a ferry and of course to a few obligatory Temple and cultural locations. Despite the hot weather there was a cooling breeze when cycling and the going / pace was very easy with no hills or strenuous parts to the tour. Anybody with even a low / moderate level of fitness could easily cope with this. The tour finished back at the clubhouse where dinner and a drink was served. The guys also gave me some excellent suggestions for local bars, music venues, etc., and overall this was an excellent way to pass half a day in Bangkok and see a side that most tourists will never see. The tour leader also took frequent photos and emailed them to me which was a really good and nice touch / bonus. Top marks under all headings"

Through the internet I found the site of Follow Me Bike Tours and booked a tour through the historical center of the city. The so-called Siam Boran tour. That day, because of the previous floodings, I happened to be the only client. It became an absolutely fantastic experience with the local guide called Top. I did really get to see so much of the city, passing by markets, alleys and palaces. The bike was of a great quality and so was the tour guide. Because I enjoyed the day so much (really from start to finish), I decided to book for the the next day the Siam Sawan tour, which would be outside Bangkok. The next day we left on a longtail boat and crossed the river to arrive in Phra Pradeang cycling through the jungle and a beautifull park. It was a hug contract with the day before, but equally unforgettable. Apologies it took me almost a year to write this post! Your warm welcome at the club house and the 2 days cycling in and around Bangkok deserve a good recommendation!! Many thanks again Ray, Top and team. Looking forward to see you again.All the best, Harold"

We must say it is so difference being in the car to being on a bicycle. Mr Top who had excellent English and had so much knowledge of places, took us through small alley ways and see how people living, difference kind of houses; big & small, old & new. Everybody we cycling by say hello and gave us waves and smile. Surprisingly, those small alleys are so interesting; so much to see. We were cycling through markets; fresh food, flowers, gifts, shoes and gadgets, visiting some important landmark such as first Thai bank, old custom house which now is a firemen home stay. Mr Top took us to a couple of local temples as he knew we have been to those big famous one before. One of the temples is Wat Prayurawongsawas Waraviharn, a big white chedi of the temple easily visible from the Chao Phraya River located on Thonburi side of the river. There is a small museum of Buddha images. We went in the Chedi and we amazed how well the temple is maintained. The other one is Wat Kalayanamitr where Long Por Tor, a big Buddha image housed in a big viharn. The temple is well known and popular among Thai-Chinese in Thailand.Ray (the manager) was pleased to hear I raved about the tour after I came back to his office. Ray said \u201cGreat to hear the comments came from a Thai person about the tour\u201d.

Taken together the samples were more than a complete meal. Some of us then worked off the food tour with a bike tour through the back alleys of Bangkok. This is more about the sights you will see than the bike riding, as your feet are pushing you throu a narrow alley almost as often as you are pedaling, but what an experience! Being on a bike gave you access to areas you wouldn't normall see(the back alleys of people's homes) and gave you a perspective of how folks get around.

Indeed, I booked the Siam Sawan Tour the next day.I shall be back with my family!Congratulations to the Follow Me Team- you have an excellent product to offer!"

            "review": "Thanks Tob!. This was the second part of the Bites and Bike Tour for me. The first part was a food tasting tour around the River City area, which I also highly recommend. After arriveng at the \"Follow Me\" club house, we were introduced to our guide Tob, who fittied us to our bikes. We were given plenty of water to start off the trip. The bike ride went though mostly back alleyways and small streets that a tourist like me would never enter into. We had a chance to encounter many local residence and see their daily living styles. We made a few stops along the way, and refreshment was provided. This is an experience you won't get by simply hitting all the major attractions yourself. It was a world hidden from most tourists and I'm very glad I joined the tour and had a chance to see it! Among other things, we visited various local markets, crossed the river, and saw 2 temples that tourists don't usually know about or venture to. Our guide Tob was taking pictures of us the whole time. The shots will be sent to us via email, for no extra charge! Towards the end of the trip, it started POURING. A rain coat was provided, but we were only 10 minutes from the club house and decided to just ride it out. Wow, it was a totally awesome experience riding the back streets of Bangkok in the rain! Our hot dinner was waiting for us when we arrived at the Club House.Here's the most amazing part. I left my camera bag with my D700 and 2 lenses on the boat we were riding to cross the river. I freaked out after realizing this. Our guide Tob immediately called the boat operator, and she confirm she picked it up. Phewwww... After guiding us back to the Club House, Tob went off to help me retrieve the camera bag, RIDING FOR OVER AN HOUR IN POURING RAIN! It was coming down SO hard at this point, others in the group couldn't even make it to the BTS station 5 min away. Tob seriously went above and beyond for me. When he came back with my bag, I thanked him and gave him a big tip. He more than deserved it!"

All very good so far ... but, the cycling was down lots of very narrow, crowded alleys. My partner found this worrying and difficult, despite being a very proficient bike rider in his youth (a long time ago). Though he expressed his concerns and clearly said that he was not happy with the experience about twenty minutes into the five-hour tour, the guide did not make suggestions as to how he could leave the tour and my partner did not want to spoil the enjoyment for the other two people on the tour. Had there been another guide, he could have gone back with him, or the guide actually should have arranged for him to return to the hotel or club house via taxi. Instead, he was subjected to a ride he hated. We cycled through narrow alleys, with motor bikes, children and animals all around, we cycled through crowded markets, and we constantly had to get off and on the bikes as well as occasionally lift them on and off ferries, and up and down a couple of bridges. The final problems occurred when we had to return along main roads in a thunder storm. Though ponchos were provided, we were soaked to the skin and water swirled around our ankles. I was very relieved that none of us actually came off our bikes, though we did spend quite a long time sheltering in a narrow alley while the guide went off to find the other couple who went missing after he had made a turn off the main road down another narrow alley. He did eventually manage to find them, but I felt throughout the trip that he should take more care ensuring that people were following him - he vary rarely stuck his hand out to show which direction he was about to turn in. I personally didn't mind the narrow alleys, the main road cycling and the rain too much but what disappointed me most was the lack of history on the history tour. The commentary was lacking. Why were the alleys built as they were, who lives in these homes? Where was the religious and cultural history as promised - we got some fleeting references to Catholics and went to see a large Buddah but there was nothing hanging all these fragmented bits together. As suggested in previous reviews, a booklet showing the route and what we may see along it, would help to make up for the lack of commentary. We sat by the river having a drink, kindly provided by the guide, but we had to ask the name of it, and there was the missed opportunity to explain about the different sides and the importance of the river.I've written the above reluctantly but I feel the company has so much potential, and under different circumstances I'm sure there are people who will enjoy these tours and you certainly get a lot for your money. It's really good value and if you are young, fit, enjoy riding bikes in crowded conditions and believe you can get your history well enough from Wikipedia, then I would recommend you to try this ."

I have taken many (10+) cycle tours across South East Asia with many companies (Spice Road, Grasshoper etc) and for me Follow Me are the best of the bunch. For me what sets Follow Me apart is1. The quality of the guides - friendly, thoughtful, inclusive and highly conscientious 2. The bikes - Standard mountain bikes as well as more comfortable, large saddled city bikes are offered. All bikes are well maintained and include bells which are important when navigating the busy streets of Bangkok3. The extra service offered - Unlike other companies the Follow Me club house isn't simply a place to start and finish your trip it's also a place where you can relax. I like the fact that before you begin your tour you have the opportunity to sit down have a cup of (free) tea/coffee/water and get to know the rest of your group before you begin your trip. Also once your trip is complete a traditional Thai meal or BBQ is served, once again you can enjoy free tea/coffee/water or you can buy beer/soft drinks for a reasonable price. For me it's nice to sit down a relax after the trip and enjoy a cold beer with your tour buddies.4. The route - this takes you through a variety of small back alleys, markets and roads. It is interesting to see how buildings and people change as you pass through different neighborhoods e.g. China Town and the Muslim area.These little touches for me make a big difference and are the reason why I will always recommend follow me above any other company in Bangkok"

            "review": "A great day exploring Bangkok. My wife and I went on the trip soon after arriving in Bangkok. It was a wedding gift from some good friends back in the UK (we married shortly before moving to Bangkok). The day started with meeting at the BTS at 10am. We then met our guide and began the walking tour part of the day. We were given maps and could ask as many questions as we wanted. We stopped at about five places throughout the morning and into the afternoon, trying dishes such as Thai duck, spicy catfish salad and the traditional green curry. This has been really useful, as since the trip I have been able to try these things again at different places. We also stopped at a few temples on the walking tour, which usually I would have missed. The second part of the day was a cycling tour around the older parts of the city and along the river, stopping at various places of interest along the way. I used to cycle alot in the UK, and thought that it would be one of the things I would have to give up on moving to Bangkok. However, the tour showed me that it is possible to cycle in this city, and that it can be an enjoyable experience. We cycled through Bang Rak, to temples, through the flower market and China Town, then went over the river, and to Wat Arun along with other temples. All in all it was a day very well spent and I would recommend the trips to anybody. There were some in our cycling group that weren't as experienced on a bike, but they found the trip enjoyable and not too taxing. It can easily slot into a day's stopover and allows you to see parts of the city that could be missed. I have been recommending the tour to colleagues and friends since we got back."

My Boyfriend and I visited Bangkok early September and as we were only there for 2 days we were pushed for time and wanted to see as much as we could! We booked ourselves on the morning tour of the markets and temples and arrived to be measured up for our bikes around 8am, an early start but really worth it!!! We were in a group with another couple, met our guide for the morning and set off on our trip.It was a little scary at first as we rode along some very busy roads, but our guide was extremely attentive too everyone in the group and ensured our safety at all times. After a while we settled in to the ride and our confidence grew.We visited some amazing places, temples, markets, local fire station and through the small streets where the people of Bangkok got on with their busy lives. Every person we came across gave us all a welcoming smile and some stopped to say/wave hello :-) Drinks and snacks were offered throughout the morning, like I said the guide was so attentive!We arrived back at the club house, where a tasty Thai meal were waiting for us (optional western BBQ)We had a fantastic day, best thing I've done in a long time. Thank you very much to the owner and guide for some fantastic photographs and even better memories"

All in all a great day out and I saw some of the real Bangkok, 5 star hotels on one side and normal Thai families on the other, going about daily life in this busy bustling metropolis! Also actually getting out and doing a bit of exercise really helped with jetlag and the spaced out feeling after a long flight and travelling. Thanks again, hopefully do it again one day!!"

Cycling takes you to places you don't see when travelling by BTS, taxi or even tuktuk.Don't worry about traffic, or the heat - when cycling you create your own fresh breeze, and the tours guides risk their lives to stop the traffic for you, if necessary - at least that's what it looked like to me! (And don't bother to buy rain coats, followmebiketours will provide plastic capes.)I would especially like to recommend the Bike&Boat combination, which we did: We cycled till about noon, then (when it started getting hot) got in a longtail and cruised the klongs, getting yet another view of Bangkok, and picked up the cycling tour again around 4 p.m. to cycle for another hour and finish with the barbecue at the club house. My daughter especially liked the free fish spa :) Altogether a perfect day!"

The reply to my initial enquiry was very prompt and informative about which tour would be best for us. The clubhouse was barely a 10 minute walk from our hotel and the directions provided were very thorough. All the bikes are very well maintained and comfortable. Dave was very informative and Loya was a perfect guide. The route was just amazing and a real eye opener in terms of sights and smells. The route avoids main roads so was quite safe for my 8 year old, additionally it is very flat and there were plenty of pit stops so it was a very relaxing afternoon cycling around Bangkok. We got caught in a very heavy downpour near the river which extended the tour as we had to wait until it was safe to continue to cross the river by ferry. The tour is very well organised and we even had a choice of a bbq or thai food for dinner back at the clubhouse. The children particularly enjoyed the fish spa! Cannot recommend Follow Me highly enough - we left with an amazing insight into Bangkok."

Follow Me Bike Tours takes this to a new level. We went on the \"historic tour of Bangkok\" which takes you through the back soi life and you experience not only the street life and smells but more intimately by riding through their living communities and markets. Amazing that one can still do this....and on a bike! Stopping along the way and crossing the Chao Phraya by ferry, we got some good info and background on the historic sights. To top it off, they served us lunch in their charming garden afterwards! A great way to spend a day in Bangkok other than hitting the malls."

My wife and I had already been to your typical tourist attractions (Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, etc) and we wanted to get a feel for the rest of Bangkok. After reading up on the various tour companies we decided to try a bike tour. We contacted Follow Me and received a confirmation that afternoon for a tour the next day.The next morning we arrived at the clubhouse and was greeted by Dave (one of the owners), Tob (our guide for the day), and a cup of tea, which we drank as we met the rest of our tour group. Once we were ready we were promptly given a bike and fitted so that we could ride comfortably.The tour took us through side streets of the surrounding neighborhood, taking us to our first major stop, the old customs house. From there we meandered along the river stopping in various neighborhoods and getting a feel for the people, their lives and their culture. Tob gave us wonderful tidbits of information as we travelled to each neighborhood. The pace was comfortable and allowed everyone to ride comfortably.At the end of the tour we made our way back to the clubhouse for a Thai lunch and a fish spa. I had heard about this before, but never experienced it. What an awesome treat after a morning of riding around town. The food was also delicious. During our meal we were able to see the pictures that Tob took along the way. These were emailed to us so we could enjoy the, at home.All in all, Follow Me Bike Tours was a great experience. If you want to see how the Thai live in Bangkok, see hidden temples and markets that stimulate the senses, give them a call and arrange for a tour!"

But we found out that its a food tour first, and then our guide passes us on to the bike tour. Which was good because we got to really work off all that feasting! The fellars at the Follow Me club house are really friendly and easy to get along with. To my knowledge, Dave runs the business (and cooks a great BBQ!) and to our delight the other guys, Bond and Tob spoke excellent English and so that made for good conversation. We cycled from around 2pm till 6pm I think. We followed a crazy route up the Chao Phraya river that took us from the quiet and quaint backlanes of BKK's housing area, to the busy streets and highways, and even though Chinatown and a wet market! I didn't particularly like having to maneuver my bike through the wet market or Chinatown while having to keep up with the rest... it got a bit frustrating. but I guess it was all part of the adventure. The bike tour gave us a really unique BKK experience as we were able to see many parts of what a typical BKK lifestyle is like, just by being flexible on the bike. I'd say that this tour isn't for the weak hearted though. You gotta be alert at all times for safety and be willing to get a little grubby through the heat and rain (if it rains). We had a simple but delicious BBQ waiting for us when we got back to the clubhouse. A fish spa is available too! Overall, it was a great experience and hopefully you'll get a fun bunch of tourists from all over the globe to tour with like we did!"

It was fascinating cycling down narrow ways, past (sometimes it felt like 'through') people's houses, down by the railway to a boat crossing of the river and over to a floating market, some brilliant concrete walkways above a swampy area on the island, and into a pretty park where we fed some fish - thence back across the river to a different point and home.

You will get stuck in the traffic even taking a taxi or tuk-tuk. So, cycling is the best way for you to explore in Bangkok.i booked a bike tour few days before for 3 person via email, Ray from Follow Me replied me soon. He allowed me to bring extra person at last even i can't confirm one of my friend's attendance. Follow Me Club is locating somewhere near BTS (Chong Nonsi station). We can easily reach there early morning with the map given by Ray. We even had a simple breakfast which we bought from 7-11 store along the way to the Club.Before we started the tour, they do provide us coffee and tea followed by a simple briefing. We don't need to bring our belongings as every bikes have a small pouch attached. We just put our camera and tissue paper inside the pouch. (They take photo with their own camera for you too.)We had Loya as our guide during the tour. Loya is a charming girl and take good care of us. She brought us to many places which you would never found by yourself. For safety reason, she always insisted to be the first when crossing every busy road. This experience was great, some local people gave their warmly greet when you pass through their houses. You don't need to worry about the hot weather as we cycling through the backstreets and alley. We were given chance to taste some local snacks and cold mineral water too. Unfortunately we had our bike tour on Sunday morning, some shops closed so we can't really feel the crowd when we pass through the Chinatown. Anyway, there were still some morning market that we can see their daylife. Loya brought us back to the club on time. We took a rest with enjoying the fish spa and having the BBQ chicken, burger prepared by Ray. The environment was good and cool.Overall the bike tour is fantastic and interesting, we really had a good time with them. i will join them again if i have chance to Bangkok in the future."

We did the downtown Bangkok tour in mid-July 2012 at 8:00 a.m. It took about 4,5 hoursthat went by really fast: The welcome at the clubhouse was friendly, welcoming and professional at the same time, the gear (bikes and helmets) made a very good impression and we started right after welcome drinks and coffee. We were a group of eight plus our two guides. The guides were perfect: locals from Bangkok, good English, quite knowledgeable about the sights and very caring about our safety.The bike ride was lots of fun but you need basic biking skills to navigate around the little streets. However, my wife and I only go biking every couple of months, never do long trips and this tour was NO problem for us at all!Have been to Bangkok three times as a tourist now, and this tour definitely added a new experience. If you generally like riding bikes and are in Bangkok, you absolutely should do this tour!"

We explored through so many areas (Chinese markets- flowers and veggies, river bike paths, ferry crossing and so much more!) that I never would have seen without this tour. Our guide was so informative and even tried to explain Buddhist concepts in English with me! It was a lovely day with a great meal at the end and a good price. Recommended for everyone!!"

Riding was easy and I'm not a cyclist and the guides help manage the traffic for you....very easy ride, but HOT....recommend that you take a cold cloth from your hotel to help manage the heat....follow Me provides plenty of liquids to keep you hydrated and lots of breaks....the barbecue lunch afterward was a nice friendly touch....this is a Must Do!

Good guide who takes you to places where you normally couldn't come, very small alleys, fish and vegetable market in the middle of Chinatown. You just cycle trough.. in the Netherlands we would almost be prosecuted for that but in Bangkok it is no problem at all, people are very plolite a relaxed way of cycling. The guide (Tod) tells you a lot about the things you see, gets you drinks and snacks. A relaxed way of spending the time. After the trip (we did 25km in the old town of Bangkok) you get a beer/or soda and have a meal! it was great! We would recommend Follw me to everyone!"

And when it is all over (even in 35c/95f heat, you won't want the bicycling part to end), you're treated to a tasty barbecue cooked personally by David.

I did the food tasting tour in the morning followed by the bike tour. Both were great tours and recommend them both to any one wanting to see the real Bangkok. The food tasting tour food in the morning was very filling. I was so full I could stay for the BBQ buffet at the end o the bike tour. I loved the fried catfish and the nam tok at the third stop - so good!!! The sweets were also nice. The Muslim restaurant certainly took me out of comfort zone. I had the beef curry whih was Too oily and the beef was not edible - too tough. The last restaurant was modern and there many Thais there. The quality was good and prices cheap I would go there again. I had mixed feelings about the bike tour. The tour guide was great, the route we took was just perfect. I saw sides of Thailand that I have never seen - narrow pathways, back alleyways, peoples homes, crocodiles, markets that you wouldn't want to walk through ( but great to ride through :) ), raised walk ways along the chaprahya - we went through places Id never go alone or even with friends. The disappointing part of the bike tour was that I was the only person on it and it was a little slow. Riding through narrow back streets and among slum like areas was uncomfortable being the the only foreigner there. I mean we rode through some dark and very isolated places - places you don't want to be. It made me quite anxious. I saw poor children and people living in squalor, which being a parent myself, was very saddening. The markets were an eyeopener too, smelly places but the food very clean it amazes me to think that these places provide the food used in the hotels I stay in. Being the only person on the tour made BBQ buffet dinner quite unenticing fortunately I wasn't too hungry. The fish spa at the end was a new experience, fun but a bit lonely. I would have liked if tour guide could have walked me to the train station as the club house is quite isolated. On the way back I got the fright of my life by a stray dog which came out of no where and barking loudly... I didn't have rabies vaccinations so was a little rattled though nothing happened. The tour could have been faster as I was hoping to get a workout but that's okay. I was also expecting to see the jungle like areas per the pictures on the website but as I found out this was not on my tour.All in all was a good experience and took me out of my comfort zone, I'd recommend being flexible with dates and do the bike tour with others."

We stayed in BK for 5 days in May 2012 and although we did many great things, this was the highlight. We met at the Clubhouse and were quickly introduced to our bikes and \"Tob\" our guide (who was fantastic). We set off on our tour, the route for which apparently took months in the planning and research. Our tour took about 4 hours and we are told covered approximately 22 Km. I should say straight away that absolutely none of the pedalling was at all strenuous, we were told that people as young as 5 and old as 90 had done the tour, and I can believe that.The tour took us to parts of Bangkok that we would not ever have seen on our own. Down narrow alleys, through markets, across the river by ferry.....the sights, smells and sounds were amazing. We stopped several times for refreshments as it was very hot.During the tour, Tob took photos of my wife and I as we rode along. On our return to the club house we were fed (a nice chicken and rice dish) and amazingly the 79 photos Tob had taken had already been emailed to my account.....a fabulous touch.I cannot recommend this enough, it's simply the only way to see BK like only the locals do. Many thanks to Follow Me!!!"

Maybe the relaxing club house gave me the first bit of strength. And everyone was nice enough to not laugh at me picking a children's bike. (Feel less nervous on a shorter bike.) Not to mention Tob, our lovely tour guide, encouraged me from time to time with his big bright smile. Anyway, it was not as scary as I thought it would be. The traffic was okay. (It was a sunday, maybe that's why.) I was usually at the back of the line, but Tob would always make sure I was following and that I was doing okay. We got to see some temples, ride on a ferry, drink cola from a plastic bag with ice... how cool is that? Oh, did I forget to mention the fantastic BBQ food prepared for us at the club house after the tour? LOVE IT !In all, it's a great day. I brought home with me some bruises, (I'm sure it's just me.....) together with a lot of lovely pictures and a big smile on my face.

Treated to the sights, smells and many smiles of Bangkok as we went along the narrow alleys, it was a unique way to see Bangkok and the way people went about their daily lives. Touched alot of areas where we would never see if we went on our own. A considerable level of bike navigation skills is needed as you will be meandering through heavy traffic and very narrow streets/alleys. Other than that, the ride was breezy and relaxing.

We were very impressed with this tour , leaving a lasting imprint to start off 2 weeks in Thailand and must say it was one of the fondest memories we have of our trip,such a fantastic way to see so many different sides of Bangkok. Our guide Vincent was terrific with a great sense of humor and we had a small group of 4 which was just perfect.the 25km ride was a breeze ( and this is coming from someone who isn't too fond of bike riding as exercise) the bikes I'm sure have a lot to do with it .. great suspension , gender personalized and even a comfy seat =) Vincent made sure to take lots of photo's which is fantastic for anyone not keen on taking a camera (there are little bags on the bike if you are keen) these photo's are then emailed to you to look back on .Dinner after the tour was great , even providing for us vegetarians in the group which was very much appreciated and unexpected.I will have no hesitation doing another of \"Follow me \" bike tours when I return to Bangkok in the future and I highly recommend them as a tour company..

Well i accidently stumbled on this bike tour when I saw a load of cyclists and asked where to hire bikes from, and one american guy gave me the number for the tour. So I called them up and booked the tour for the next day with my friend aswell. We then arrived at the Follow Me tour place around midday as the tour didnt start until 13:00h. Its a very peaceful club house and we got a feel of the bikes as its a 4hr tour so I chose the one with a comfy seat. They have choices which is excellent. The tour guide was Thai but he spoke excellent English and we rode through the back streets taking in the local life of Bangkok, a far cry from 5 star hotels but i was captivated. Everyone had a smile, rich or poor and they all waving to us while we were riding through busy markets and along the streets whilst stopping off for some fresh mango and pineapple and grilled pork skewers! Awesome! We also visited temples and other places of importance within 4hrs. I learnt a lot. You would not get to see this Bangkok life with hotel tours as they would only take u to tourist hot spots. The tour guide also captured some good fotos of us and we get the fotos emailed to us the next day. After the tour, we went back to clubhouse where we were treated to a fish foot spa (needed after 4hrs riding) and a BBQ. A very tasty BBQ at that with a few Singha beers. The trip organiser was a Dutch guy called Ray. A friendly chap with a weird sense of humour!! The clubhouse was very relaxing and peaceful, and I smoked a nice big Romeo and Juliet cigar. It was just what was needed after a great day. There are a few bike tours in Bangkok but i would recommend Follow Me as a MUST to do in Bangkok.

You get a first hand taste of all the sights, sounds and smells of the city which is far better than any other mode of transportation avail (tuk tuk, cab, or sky train). I did the Siam Boran - Siam Historical tour which took around 5 hours. The bike ride was super casual and at an easy pace. Basic bike handling skills required... being an avid cyclist this was no problem but be aware that the tour weaves through narrow alley ways, markets and sometimes sharing the road with other vehicles. The tour guide was very helpful and accommodating and we took water/snack breaks along the route as needed. I would highly recommend it and would go back and do the other tours."

Despite the intimidating traffic, it was a great way to see the local lifestyle and experience the hospitality of Thailand. Be warned, the tour requires a moderate level of fitness and skills on a bike. The path can be narrow, crowded, with 90 degree turns. Overall it's was a great experience; one that I would do again and recommend to others."

We were a little worried we\u2019d find Bangkok a little overwhelming coming from a country whose population is comparatively small, but doing this tour made visiting Bangkok so accessible. We\u2019d read reviews for other bike tours but what attracted us to Follow Me were the little \u2018extras\u2019 like the free wifi, BBQ lunch, fish spa (which I found too ticklish), and amazing \u2018action\u2019 photos. We\u2019re so glad we booked with Follow Me, we enjoyed the narrow winding alleys, the ferry across the river, being able to see people going about their daily business, the old customs house now being used for firemen and their families, and seeing Tosakan the tenfaced guardian at Wat Arun. At times it felt like sensory overload, all five senses titillated and assaulted at the same time.Tob our guide took great care of us \u2013 he was patient with those of us (me) who are a little slower, knowledgeable, witty, friendly, and sanuk! His photography skills are to be commended too as I\u2019m sure most of the pictures he took were taken whilst cycling and guiding us safely round Bangkok\u2019s narrow alleys and busy streets. As people have mentioned in previous reviews it\u2019s a good way to cover a lot of ground whilst still taking in some of the major sights. Although there were a few busier streets we still felt quite safe, possibly that\u2019s because we\u2019re used to a country that is not kind to cyclists, at least in Bangkok traffic users are more accommodating. Communication when setting up our tour was speedy and informative, the instructions to the clubrooms provided enough detail for us (or rather our motorcycle taxis) to easily find our way, and Follow Me provided helpful instructions on how to get to the BTS for our return trip\u2026 and thanks again Ray for sending ALL the high res copies of the pictures Tob took!Next time we visit Bangkok we\u2019re calling in to Follow Me for another trip.NB: the bikes are very comfortable, I have a Dutch Oma bike which is also a very comfy ride but the Follow Me seats are even better, almost tempted if I weren't so attached to upright cycling ;)"

She absolutely loved to see the other kind of life in the winding backstreets of Bangkok and the park area with elevated pathways. We got an exclusive tour, as we were the only participants in the group. Tob is very attentive and seems to know the area inside out. The traffic was as bad as it ever gets, as it was a Monday morning. However, by following Tob's lead, it felt relatively safe to navigate through those couple of short main street legs before getting to quieter roads.On the way back to the base, we were honored to meet the son of the former prime minister of Thailand, who maintains his father's legacy house. This was quite unexpected, even Tob looked a bit surprised by the encounter. Back in the base, the fish spa was a thrilling experience.If I try to find anything on the con side, perhaps my bicycle could use some adjustment. Did not notice the sticky gears, sliding handlebar and sloping seat before we were under way. It was a minor issue, really, as the pace was easy and the terrain was flat. I ride with bicycle a lot at home, and could have done this trip pedaling with my hands. The narrow allys and sharp corners present some physical challenge to the trip, though."

The company was easy to work with and provided a nice facility to relax in as well as a bar-b-q lunch after the half day tour. The instructions on finding the meeting point were reasonably clear. I had been somewhat concerned about the viability of daytime cycling in 30+ degrees in Bangkok but this really was not an issue, the cycling was gentle, the breeze from the air movement was refreshing and we were not very often in unprotected sun. The tour started by going through some interesting backstreets and urban communities before reaching the river for a short boat ride. This was followed by an hour or so along raised concrete pathways though a semi-cultivated banana plantation. While these 1-2 meter-high pathways made progress through a very wet area possible, they do require some basic cycling skill and it is not hard to imagine a novice rider coming to grief. The park itself, the final destination, is elegant and pleasant. A stop at a \"traditional Thai house\" on the way back was delightful, not least as a picturesque wedding was going on in the gardens. The price was very reasonable, but I would suggest a beginner start with a different tour."

Crossing the river either by ferry or by longtail boat is another highlight of each tour. The bikes are modern and working properly, helmets and water are provided. If you need you can get an insurance for your adventure (remember your passport no). Take a printout of the map of the homepage of Follow Me Bike Tours and follow the clear instructions and you will find them easily.

We all bike for recreational and practical purposes on a daily basis. We took the Historic tour combined with the canal boat tour. What an absolutely enjoyable day. We found the bike trip through back allies, side streets, tiny walking allies between buildings and even places marked for bike paths, just about the most interesting and FUN activity we had ever had ( in our lives!). Requires excellent balance and confidence on a bike - lots of narrow places with curves, twists and turns, but just a wonderful, wonderful experience. Full of insights into cultural aspects of Bangkok. The canal boat ride in the middle of the day was a strong contrast.... quiet, calm and leisurely. We also went into the small \"back street\" canals around Bangkok. Interesting too - nice combination. The bike ride was on 99% flat terrain, the last 20 minutes through slow-moving but heavy traffic. Maybe not suitable for young children. Ask the tour operators about alterative return routes if travelling with young children. We came back, devoured super delicious BBQ food and I was ready for a new trip, and just soooo sorry I had no more time to do all their trips. Now I am planning my next trip to Thailand, no longer hating Bangkok, just can't wait to do another trip with Follow Me. Our leaders were very confident and able, handled ushering us across zebra crossings in busy streets very well. We felt we were in very good hands. Tour guides spoke English quite well and showed they cared about our well-being.

As a resident of Bangkok it took me to places I didn't know existed, through many narrow backstreets and local communities. They minimise the amount of time on main roads and are very safety conscious with the group. There is always something interesting and different to see around every corner \"Top\" the Thai guide is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable, really excellent. The bikes are the best I have come across in Thailand-well maintained and comfortable and they will even add a child seat for small kids and have helmets if you want them. They also give you water.I have also been on a similar tour with another company and it was almost 2x the price: the guides were jaded, the bikes were not maintained & even had rusty workings, we spent too much time on busy roads and they did not keep control of the group for safety. Quite the opposite is true for Follow Me.The route is flat all the way for is easy for anyone. The only hairy bit is near the end where it is necessary to cycle along a busy road(unavoidable in Bangkok). When you return they even give you a BBQ lunch (fairly basic and no good for vegetarians, but a great gesture) and you can use their fish spa for free. You can relax at their clubhouse for as long as you like afterwards, in their quiet neighbourhood. Tip: To get there make sure you get the map for the clubhouse as it can be hard to find at first because people keep stealing their signs! It is actually walking distance from Chong Nonsi BTS."

On a tour like this, you need someone who is control of the situation at all times and Tob pulled it off very well. He was great at explaining the history of some of the sites, as well as stopping here and there to buy snacks and drinks for the group.I will say that this tour undersold the trip a little by saying you only bike on back roads. We hit rush hour on the way back and definitely were biking down some busy Bangkok roads for parts of the tour. I quickly learned that this is not the US where you have a 5-foot wide \"bike lane\" to ride in - you are inches from cars whizzing by you and can feel the exhaust on your legs. This will be terrifying or exhilarating depending on the person on the bike, but everyone seems to make it through safely. Upon your return to the \"clubhouse\", you are greeted by a delicious BBQ meal and a fish spa to unwind. Even with the craziness, I highly recommend this tour and Tob as a guide.

The tour I picked is Siam Boran, which took me to a number of temples, church, inside China town, seeing crocodiles and etc... I don't think I can go such many interesting places in 4 hours w/o the effort from Follow Me Bike. Especially a big thanks to Vincent for his extra care on me! I know I was troublesome enough.. sorry to bother and appreciate for your patient :)After the half day tour, Ray and the staff already prepared a nice meal for us. And he especially prepared foods for my veggie diet. How nice they're!I see you just bought a folding bike. I will try it next time :)"

It was genuinely the most authentic, exciting and visceral tourist experience I've ever hand (and I travel a lot). I'm definitely going back again next time I'm there. I really can't recommend it enough.The staff are very friendly and even took pictures of our trip as we cycled the city and gave them to us at no extra cost.Top marks for a fantastic service by fantastic people.

It started with a very well kept facility, anda very pleasant and interesting staff. The owners and guide were most pleasant and a pleasure to meet. The bikes were easy to use with great extra cushion seat, which were comfortable from start to finish. The tour itself was most enjoyable, it showed all the wonders of the city, from the city streets to the jungles,and a boat ride across the river to it's beautiful temples, and most fun to me its markets, all from the seat of bike.

He took us to places we would not have seen or experienced had we not been guided by a local, and we had a blast! We felt very safe and in good hands, and Tob was very knowledgeable about all of the places he took us too. He also took tonnes of photos during the tour that were emailed to us, which we were very happy about. The tour went for about 4 hours, but it wasn't tiring at all as plenty of stops are made along the way. At the end of the tour, since it was only the two of us (not enough people for the BBQ buffet), Tob went and picked us up a couple of local dishes and rice, which was delicious! We highly recommend Follow Me Bike Tour, it is worth every penny!Side note: it was a bit hard finding the place, we got a bit lost, but printable instructions/map are available on their website which we should have used..."

So my wife and I did a half day tour with Follow Me and it was one of the best things we did in our entire stay in Thailand.Our guide was very friendly, knowledgeable and spoke good English. The owner, Ray, has a real passion for the city and for Thai culture and this comes across in the tour.We cycled through markets, narrow streets and were led to stunning views that we never would have had the opportunity to witness had we not done the tour. We also took the tour in late November 2011 shortly after the flooding. It seems the tourist areas of Bangkok had been protected by the floods and were it not for this tour taking us off the regular tourist trail we would not have seen the true effects of the floods on the city. The image if a lady cooking in her kitchen with water above her knees is an image that affected me and will stay with me forever; without \u2018Follow Me\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to see another side of this wonderful city.

The reason I do the bike tours is because its the best and nicest way to see the city. Trust me I travel a lot! The follow me bike tour is out of this world. Its the second one I've been on in Bangkok. The other company was so bad. I will be putting a review up for them later and they deserve it. With the follow me tours they have a club house where you all meet up and return to. The other tours seem to make you wait at the side of the street where you are getting hassled by locals who seem to think your lost and want to take you else where. Everyone will turn up late and by that time I wasn't keen on doing anything. With follow me bike tours I was sitting at the Club house having some cool water talking with the guide who was making sure I was happy with the bike etc. The tours are very interesting and the guides speak great english. There was one called \"Top\" i think his name was he was excellent. The bikes seem to be all new and very conferrable. I was happy after the tour we went back to the Club house for the free BBQ really tasty chicken, there was no rush to leave like the other tour companies. There were around 6 in our group we were all happy. I'm going to do another tour with them when I get back from Phuket. Thanks Guys for a great time."

(some of them in the group suffered from a 'soar bum' towards the end of the trip lol..) The guide also made sure that we had refreshments along the way and a constant supply of packaged drinking water.On our return to the Follow Me office we were surprised with a barbeque and a fish spa.

PRINT THE MAP! PRINT THE MAP! PRINT THE MAP! -- http://www.followmebiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/followmeclubhouse.pdfthe clubhouse was a little bit difficult to find (perhaps placing more signboards along main roads would be helpful). the bikes were in good condition. no worries on the equipments.now for the tour - me and my partner went together for the Siam Historical Tour. we planned for the afternoon bike tour to be on the first day of our travel itinerary but was worried that we might arrive late so sent an email before arrival to check whether we could still join their tour on that day. email response was fast and assuring. however, due to flight delay in Singapore and bangkok jam, by the time we arrived at our hotel, it was already too late for the tour, so we immediately asked the hotel concierge to call and cancel that day's bike tour. when i later personally called to reschedule for a morning tour the day after, i was very surprised at how well they answered our queries (in english) over the phone ... after meeting ray and his partner at the clubhouse (then i understood) =Di initially thought that the tour would be \"easy\" but i think difficulty level is relative. well, it's easy as in we used roads and not trail, travelled on flats and not slopes but the tough part was the narrow back lanes and motorists (i don't think this is any fault of the tour operators because their tour purpose IS to show the back lanes and minimise the use of main roads) ... so this is more of a expectation guide for others who intend to take up this tour and fully enjoy it - you should be quite comfortable with bike balance and proficient in bike control through narrow passageways, along uneven roads and around tight corners.unfortunately, my partner wasn't so comfortable and we felt bad to be slowing down the whole group, so she decided to head back to the club house after a quarter of the way (led back safely by ray's partner ... so sorry i didn't manage to get your name)along the way, we manage to see many sights (markets, churches, temples, historical buildings, etc) and crossed the ferry twice (once at Tha Thien to go to Wat Arun and second time on return trip back from Tak Sin Pier to Sathorn Pier)during the tour, our guide was great in providing us with opportunity with photo taking and rest stops and explaining the story and significance behind the different places, and everything chargeable was included in the tour (including ferry crossing, snacks, drinks, even toilet entry fees)overall experience - this is truly a great way to see a different side of bangkok (away from all the shopping and massage, etc) and highly recommend others to try it out as well. in fact, i think next time, i'm going to try the bike and food tourour thai guide was tom (i hope i heard his name correctly). conversant in english, friendly and helpful ... in fact, out of all the service providers that we experienced during our bangkok trip, i think he definitely deserved a tip but we forgot about it as we were in a bit of a rush after the tour. if i'm ever back in bangkok for another bike tour, you can expect a double tip from me!suggestions for improvements (my personal opinion)(1) a new route for novice riders (along wider and flatter roads), doesn't need to see that many sights(2) shorten the historic route a little (if the clubhouse location is located nearer to the pier, the route can be slightly shortened). another way is to concentrate on the sights nearer to clubhouse or travel to pier then take use the express boat to make up a part of the river journey(3) specialised maps and notes (can be used as souveniers) - during the tour, we saw so many things that it was bit difficult to know exactly where we were at any point in time. so a specially designed map will be great for review during and after the tour and it will be great if the map also contained small notes about each location passed (things/buildings to watch for) - this will make the overall experience even more enjoyablethanks again to the team at follow me bike tours for the wonderful experience and generous assistance during the tour. it was truly delightful!"

We arrived a few minutes late and breathless after taxi driver gave up and dropped us off in the wrong area but the reception we received at \"Follow Me\" was relaxed and \"no worries\". We were given cold drinks and a quick introduction, told not to worry about payment until we returned, and were on our way in just a few minutes. This was my 8th bike tour in Thailand in 3 years (fantastic way to see the area) but the first time with this company. Some of the things that make this company great are: A) The daily involvement of the two owners B) The fact they have a real facility and do not just meet you somewhere C) The overall friendliness of the staff D) The sturdy bicycles with nice padded seats and not those thin things that dig into you (although they can provide those if you prefer) E) The fact that everyone there speaks English F) Everything is included from admission fees to attractions to river crossing, beverages, snacks, and so forth F) The BBQ feast they provided at the end of our tour. G) The guide takes dozens of candid photos while we are riding and emails them to you after the tour; these are great since they show YOU and your friends having a good time H) Reasonable price for the tour which did not have \"extras\" tacked on. Our Thai guide spoke great English and was quite friendly and accommodating and would find the answers to our questions if he did not know the answer himself. At no point did he seem hurried or anxious or frustrated with our little group's quirks. My last tour was with a company that provided a different experience and you can see that review posted here as well. I could go into great detail about where we went and what we saw but that is not important as they have different tours and of course every day is different as to what you will encounter even if the route is the same. Bottom line is that this company's commitment to the guest experience is evident in everything they do and it clearly shows. You really need to take SOME type of bike tour while in or around Bangkok!"

What surprised me, as it did in Cambodia, was that everyone was smiling and getting on with work. It was a terrific atmosphere and our guide Tob showed us around so many places that you wouldn't ordinarily see in a tuktuk or car. The four hours absolutely flew by. Not once was I thinking I hope it finishes soon. I am already planning my next trip doing the food tour as you pass so many food stalls. Tob was great and took us some delicacies back to try. Back at HQ we were welcomed with a stunning BBQ with beers! We stayed there for a bit eating and having a laugh. The banter was fantastic as was the food! I whole heartedly recommend this tour. Even for those who feel that they'd be happier on the back of a tuktuk being driven about."

There were only the two of us and we went places we didn't even know you could get a bike into- I'll never forget all the amazing smells from the China Town market stalls and shops.Lunch and a foot spa completed a fabulous trip. We'll definitely do another one on our next visit."

I\u2019ve lived in Bangkok for 12 months now and although I\u2019ve heard of the bicycle tours in the city I had never tried one before. 3 of my friends were visiting from the U.K so we decided to take the plunge and do a bicycle tour.As I live in Sathorn, Follow Me was the natural choice as it\u2019s so close to where I live. We decided to do the Chinatown morning tour. What I was surprised about when we arrived at Follow Me was the garden they have. It\u2019s this awesome oriental garden with a pond and table to chill on before the tour. A total contrast to the huge buildings and busy roads you see in Bangkok.We met our tour guide and he prepped us about what can be expected on the tour. One of my friends was dubious about cycling on any main roads in Bangkok as the traffic can be crazy. She was soon put at ease by the guide and was told we\u2019d be keeping to the back Soi\u2019s (alleys) away from any heavy traffic.After that all I can say is the tour was awesome. We made our way to the river through all these tiny soi\u2019s, hit Chinatown, crossed the river and went to Wat Arun, and apparently the day of our tour we got lucky as there was this Chinese vegetarian festival on. It was ace. Huge incense sticks and our guide (Tob) asked us if we\u2019d like to stop and sample some of the food. Too right!!!! This was totally unexpected.When we got back to the clubhouse we got more food as there was BBQ waiting for us. Follow Me also have a fish spa which I didn\u2019t check out but my friends did and they loved it.All in all a fantastic morning. Totally relaxed and stress free which I wasn\u2019t expecting. I hope to be back for the other tours soon!"

After signing up for the insurance (included in the price) we selected our own bikes. The very friendly guide took us to place in Bangkok where I have never been before and I already visited Bangkok several times. At first I was afraid we would face a lot of traffic but we went through little streets, alleys and markets. When we came back they owner already started the BBQ for us, which was included in the price! After the BBQ the girls went crazy over the foot spa (included) and we went for a couple of beers, available for a very reasonable price. Was nice to hang around in their garden for a while before we went back to the hotel. My wife and I will certainly do this again! Absolutely worth the money."

When I arrived the club house I found that it's only me join the tour on this weekday and I feel glad that the tour wont be cancelled and still keep customer being happy. Ray, my 'private' tour guide is nice and helpful. People like me who dont get use to cycle in a city was frghthened by the busy urban street and the very beginning. Luckily that Ray was so caring and considered another route that more suitable for me.The club house is comfortable and there is a cuite kitten calls' Kitty' who welcomed me when I backed (even it's a boy !) The jounery is great and amazing. I enjoyed the bike trip so much and I can say this experience in Bangkok was really unique.p.s. Thank you so much for Ray's photo shooting!"

The city was too bustling at the first sight. But then, when we started our bicycle trip with Follow me guides, we realized that it could be possible and (!) fun.They showed us the places, which are not accessible for tourists any more. The tight and cozy streets lead us through undiscovered areas, which were typical for the real Thailand. The local people seemed to be happy and greeted us kindly, especially my eight-year old sister who also attended the tour. Except for touring in that areas, we should also cope with riding a bike in the middle of the traffic. It was not as nice as going through the small streets, but it had its own charm. Our two guides did their best to make our ride safe. The guide showed us also some special places like famous temples and China Town. We had also the possibility to experience the life of real Thai school. The kids were amazed by our visit and wanted to have the photo with us. After that we passed the river with the ferry and went sightseeing the previous capital of Thailand.Another thing worth mentioning is our lunch at the market. If there was no person who recommended this \u2018restaurant\u2019, we would never stop there. But in spite of the fact that that place looked weird, the food was great. We paid 8 Euro for delicious lunch for eight people!Our bicycle tour lasted for 5 hours. Even though our speed was not high and we did less than 25 km, we were quite exhausted after that. The owner of Follow me company greeted us with the very good barbecue. Beside this, we could also try fish spa at his place.The weather was so kind to us that it started to rain immediately after we had sat in the covered terrace and began to eat.In the evening we could see the photos from our trip on Facebook. We highly recommend the trip with Follow me Bicycle Tours :)"

Infact I only realised you could when using tripadvisor to research something else and the link appeared on my screen. I booked the day before by visiting the clubhouse in person and was made to feel welcome, all of my questions were answered before booking. I returned the following lunch time for my afternoon \"China town\" tour, which started with a drink and a briefing from our tour guide Tobb. Once we selected our bikes we made our way through parts of Bangkok that you wouldnt normally see as a traveller. The pace of the tour is relaxed, certainly not hard work and the guide was very knowledgable and spoke good English. The tour concluded four hours later with a BBQ and a fish pedicure back at the clubhouse which was the perfect end to a good afternoon. I certainly didnt even feel like I had ridden a bike, especially for 20km and for anybody considering this tour but concerned about fitness or the distance there is nothing to worry about, plenty of water and photo stops and a visit to a cathedral and a temple with opportunity to stretch your legs. All in all an well organised tour and a good way to see Bangkok. Within a couple of hours of leaving at the end of the tour, the photos taken by the tour guide had been emailed to me as promised, all included in the price."

However, after stumbling across the idea of taking a bike tour while surfing the internet, I decided that it might be worth a whirl. Out of all the places I researched, Follow Me seemed to have the best equipment, facilities, perks etc., so I decided to try a tour with them, and I wasn't disappointed. The bikes were top notch, the staff were great, the clubhouse was fantastic, and the free BBQ topped it all off! I enjoyed it so much that I actually went back tried the other tour too.Both tours were great, and it's hard to decide which one I preferred most... They both gave me different views of the city, but the Green Lung tour was the most surprising. Like I said, I have been here for 4 years, and I had no idea that Bangkok had a veritable Jungle nestled in the middle of it! The tour takes you from the clubhouse in the center of the city, over the river by boat and into a jungle! The tour guides were great on both trips, but I guess they came into their own during the China Town trip, as there was much more them to tell us about. Once again, we were treated to a side of the city rarely seen, even by permanent residents like myself! The guides were very knowledgeable and had some nice facts about most of the sites visited.After returning to the clubhouse from both tours, we were treated with a free BBQ in a very communal atmosphere. There was also beer available, which was the perfect relaxant after a long ride!Great tours, fully recommended.Tom"

The bike was comfortable, well maintained and easy to ride.. The guides were super and very knowledgeable with great English language skills.

            "review": "Fab, professional and fun bike tour!. Currently Follow Me have two tours - I have been fortunate enough to go on both tours and I am eagerly looking forward to the launch of future tours. A few months ago I went on their Siam Historical Tour with my husband. We got a discounted tour from a promotional website in Bangkok (to help with the launch of the company). They were only just starting up and we went along to find out what it was like. Staff were friendly and professional. The bikes are new and good quality. We had a guide at the front, as well as one at the back to ensure no one got lost. The pace was good and is suitable for most people. I was a bit worried about cycling along the busy streets of Bangkok but our guide looked after us and safely guided us over the busy roads. Occasionally we needed to carry our bikes over bridges and up stairs but our guides were always on hand to help. We stopped regularly to have a refreshing drink and learn a bit about the area from the knowledgeable guides. You don't actually spend that long on the big, main roads. A lot of the tour is spent in narrow alleyways where you can really get to see everyday life in China town. My husband and I enjoyed this tour so much that when we had friends visiting from the UK in May, we came back to do the second tour, Siam Heaven. This tour goes through the slums of Bangkok, before crossing the river (by boat) and cycling through what is known as the 'Lungs of Bangkok'. This is a green area of Bangkok that I never knew existed before, despite living here for 3 years. The air is clean and it's very still and quiet. You ride along elevated, narrow walkways and need to take care with your steering otherwise you might end up in the marsh! My friends also really enjoyed this tour, especially as you get to see a different side to the Bangkok that most tourists experience. My favourite part of the tour has to be the BBQ at the end of the tour. After a hot, sticky but enjoyable bike tour, you go back to the club house where a delicious BBQ is waiting for you. Beers and other drinks are available to purchase and it is a lovely way to end the tour, chatting with staff and the other visitors. They also have a fish spa which is also fun. Thanks Follow Me for two great days out. Looking forward to the next tour and would recommend you to all my friends and family. One of my friend's with children also went on this trip and it was suitable for children too."

Even though I've lived in Bangkok for several years I was amazed at the parts of the city we accessed and how different it is to the everyday Bangkok that I know and live in.The tour was called Siam Sawan and takes in a part of Bangkok on the other side of the Chao Phraya River called Prapadeang or the \"lungs of Bangkok\". We crossed the river on a small motor boat and then cycled into what seemed like jungle at first. It was amazing to think that we were only a couple of kilometres from the very centre of the city. On raised concrete tracks we made our way through jungle swamp land teaming with bird and God only knows what else and it was really quite cool and refreshing. Finally emerging in an enormous botanic parkland that seemed to go on forever. On the way back we toured through narrow lanes and Soi's that I would never have been game to venture down alone. All up it was truly an amazing experience, even for my group of mainly, ex-pat friends. I'd highly recomment it to anyone visiting Bangkok."

But but but the moment that we stepped into the Follow Me Bike Tours office, we knew that we're in really good hands and that we were in for a very fun day. The Follow Me office is a beautiful, clean house converted into an office, with a lush garden, a fish pond, and a sitting area in a hut by the garden - which instantly gave me the impression that this office and this tour is managed really well. And I wasn't mistaken. The tour took us to places we've never been to before (we've been living in Thailand for 4 yours now) via Bangkok's side streets, markets, bridges, boats. We passed by the Chinese and Muslim communities, and areas where ordinary Thai people live. We also went to see famous and not so known temples alike, crossed the Chao Praya river, went on a bike path by the river (really beautiful), stopped for some Thai fruit and even had a glimpse of Thais playing Sepak Takraw under a flyover.The above, coupled with the really warm welcome we received from the owner/s and staff of Follow Me, made our day a really memorable one. In fact, we loved the tour so much that we are again booking another tour with them this weekend. :-)"

We went on the Siam Boram tour which took us along many narrow alleyways, through markets including Chinatown, the riverside and visiting a wat, church and pagoda. The tour consisted of about 10 customers and 2 tour guides who were very attentive and informative. It was very exciting throughout and we saw a very different side to Bangkok with much smaller homes along the alleyways plus literally riding through the markets. There were short two boat trips on the main Chaopraya river, adding variety and interest. We were well catered for with bottles of water supplied at the start, fruit and drinks halfway through and a bbq buffet with fish spa at the end. The bikes were good quality, suitable for kids as well and helmets are available for use in the office. Some tips: wear sunscreen and consider wearing a cap as you are exposed to the sun for much of the tour, take a camera- lovely sights during the tour, watch kids on the roads as some drivers are inconsiderate to cyclists and we had a few close encounters during the short time spent on the main roads. During the hot season, the morning tour may be cooler and more comfortable. I wore open toe sandels which proved to be a bad idea when my son did an emergency stop in front of me and my toes acted as a brake against his bike! Ouch! Trainers would have been better. Vegetarians- worth taking something and they are more than happy to cook it separately from the meat for you. Sweetcorn and rice is also provided with the buffet. Finally, it is hard to find...worth the company putting up more signs and keep their phone number handy in case you can't find it (we couldn't and we know Sathorn Road very well). Parking is limited and on the narrow street nearby- may be worth taking a taxi instead."
