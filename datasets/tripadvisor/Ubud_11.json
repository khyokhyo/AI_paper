Many people buy the cheap paintings from the many \"art\" shops in Bali.The Agung Rai Museum of Art gives you an opportunity to see and touch the real Balinese art and traditions.Set in few pavilions surrounded with a lavish garden, the place is peaceful and relaxing.Most of all we enjoyed the room with the musical instruments and the museum staff were very patient and friendly and allowed us to create our own music.It is a good place to visit while you are in Ubud."

I like the way they blend commercial activity and culture in a unique model that should inspire other countries. The resort is open so you can stroll through the beautiful villas and enjoy the rich parc and surroundings. Inside the museum there is plenty to uncover about how Bali became what it is now and about peoples who inspired its development by fostering local artist and creative spirit. I loved it!"

A must see attraction in Ubud, located close to the Monkey Forest Sanctuary, just little more than 1 Km away from City Center ( Ubud Palace). It has 2 sections & offers a chance to view some of the best Balinese artworks. The Entry ticket of 80000 Rp also offers a complimentary Tea/Coffee with a Balinese sweet to savour in their Warung located next to Rice fields. One can enjoy the views of Green Landscape of Ubud from here. Visitors can also visit Antonio Blanco Arts Museum in the City Center, 400 ,meters away from Palace, for another worthwhile attraction in the Arts zone. Also once these are experienced , it is better to avoid the Museum Lukisan as it is not worth the tickets charged & also becoms repeatitive."

I had the honour and pleasure of a guided visit, of the ARMA museum, by the Mr. Agung Ray himself. The job this man does with this foundation is remarkable and deserves to be supported by everyone visiting Bali. The museum is really a nice surprise with all the paintings where we can see the evolution of balinese paintings through the years. the traditional dances performed by the children and te adults are absolutely remarkable. The garden and all the environment of this Arma foundation is really a must visit place in Bali."

The works on display were painted by both local and foreign artists, thereby offering us a view of the lens which they looked at life in Bali (and the world). Perhaps reflecting the importance of religion to Balinese, many paintings have a spiritual connotation to them while the more recent artists make use of their work to reflect on life/impact of tourism on modern Bali. And yes, the museum has a cafe and the entrance ticket of RP 80,000 per person comes with one complimentary free drink at the cafe. There is also a rice field at the back of the museum. Overall, this is a nice place with aplenty of activities to spend the day. I certainly enjoyed this visit more than walking senselessly along the endless rows of shops in Ubud selling more or less the same things."

Not only are there separate buildings for Balinese, Contemporary and Modern Art, but the grounds of the museum are absolutely beautiful and wonderful for the kids to explore. My kids found something in each building that they enjoyed and they didn't feel like the collection was too overwhelming. The variety of art styles and natural surrounding that we saw were great enough to keep the kids engaged. A free coffee or tea at their lovely cafe is included in the price of the ticket, and it was a perfect finish to our afternoon at the ARMA."

Half of the museum is spent on a \"marketing\" exhibit where they talk about the CEOs or founders of major US companies, such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc. This wasn't art, but more a printed out Wikipedia page next to their photo. Maybe we were thinking \"modern\" had a different definition, but this was not our favorite Ubud memory. On the bright side, the free lemonade that came with the ticket was great."

It gives you an artistic perspective of the religion, culture and landscape, and it is interesting to see the differences in the local paintings - which are stunning. Don't miss the huge modern rice field painting from Made Kedul in the smallest building. It's hidden in an inside room, but it's fantastic.

Another, smaller one, contains modern Balinese art including some from foreigners who chose to live here. The buildings are grand, set amidst mature landscape. The price of admission comes with a coupon for a coffee or a tea. Queen Elizabeth from England was here once upon a time for what that's worth.

They also have a Thai restaurant on the grounds which we didn't get to try this time but it has good reviews so will try next time."

Mr Agung Rai was there at the entrance just showing the way to the museum, I was very impressed to meet and even chat with a man of such vision, so humble and if you don't read the booklet you might thing he is just a staff of the place. He is an inspiration. There are beautiful gardens inside, a, nice cafe and two building with paintings, One more of balinese art ( chronological relating to materials, techniques, time) and other with more modern art but also with art work of Indonesian artists. The plants in the garden are also medicinal, it is a place to relax and enjoy not to hurry."

Many different flowers, trees and sights to see. Both the modern and traditional sections of the museum were very well maintained, and the paintings and art inside really captured us. There was even a piece from New Westminster, BC in the modern area (try and find it)! Overall, a great experience well worth the time and money. You can't take photos so be aware of that but the memories will travel with you once you leave."

We did not stay in their cottages as they were quite pricey. The level of luxury is equivalent to places like Amandari and the setting for the cottages is lush.  We did see all the museums in the lovely park like setting. Someone was playing a traditional Balinese instrument while we were sightseeing. The restaurant served very nice coffee and tea and the gift shop was amazing. Even more amazing were the numerous paintings and artwork-- Walter Spies, I Gusti Nyoman Lempad, just to name a few. We are talking about millions of dollars worth of art. What a feast for the visual sense. A must see in Ubud!!!"

With nice garden and cafe. The most delightful moment is I met Mr Agung Rai himself and we had very nice conversation! Learned a lot from him regarding Bali cultural. And thinking of life.

The art museums are something that should never be missed even if you are not really interested in art and culture. The amazing works that are housed in the two galleries are a delight to the eye and the description of the pieces makes it a very relevant and learning experience. Recently there was a wonderful displace of water colours by Balinese and Indonesian artists and it was just so wonderful to stroll through and experience the lovely art. As guests we took the opportunity to visit the exhibition at night and it was a really lovely experience. It was quiet and the art was well lit so we could just take our time and wander through.Overall I would rate the ARMA are the best place I have ever stayed in. I would highly recommend the museum and the resort as a destination of choice for an amazing experience."

Agung Rai started out selling paintings in Kuta Beach some decades ago. He represented artists with a sales percentage in order that he could occasionally choose a painting to keep for his own collection. The Agung Rai Museum of Art houses this collection and now much more. Dance classes are held for the local children of Pengosekan to be sure they will feel it is their own museum, not just for the tourists. The grounds are beautiful and the architecture is very nice. There's a 'Cafe ARMA' serving delicious food adjacent to the actual Museum. Sometimes you can find a painter in 'plein air' creating on a garden terrace. Full moon music and dance programs can be amazing here. Don't miss the ARMA when you are in Bali!"

Harmony between living creativity and nature's calm. We spent more time than we intended to in arma.

It wasn't crowded at all and so it was nice to peacefully be able to look at artworks by yourself or your group for as long as you like without other people bothering you. They also put on authentic performances at night with the option of dinner - and this is at a price comparable to the Ubud Palace performances.

What a wonderful human being. I feel privileged and enriched to have spent just a few minutes in his company. We went to thank him when we were leaving but he was having a nap in his stunning garden.

We had spent delightful time in the beautiful buildings looking at the extensive and well labelled (in English) art of Bali, which alone is worth the entrance fee. We had enjoyed our free drink in the relaxing cafe and were starting to wander the gardens to the rice fields and village when we met Agung Rai. He pointed out animals and birds and fish woven in stone into the fabric of walls, told how money from the resort funds the foundation and enriched an already wonderful visit. Thankyou, Agung Rai and ARMA. If you make only one cultural visit in Ubud, consider making it this one."

The entrance fee is 60k which I later discovered included a complimentary drink - nobody said so I didn't take up the kind offer. You do get lovely and well constructed book not a booklet about the work of the family and the ARMA foundation.For me the least interesting was the actual museum but that's a matter of interest.

For my first visit to Ubud, I had researched places to visit and the Museum of Art came up highly rated with the Golden Hour Tour also appealing strongly. Neither disappointed.The art work all but brought tears to my eyes, most of it so beautiful and touching, and the grounds and buildings were magnificent - shade, gardens, running water, a wood carver at work, signs in English. I was not staying in the accommodation (ARMA) but walked through it to access the reception area to see if I could book a Golden Hour Tour and it looked impressive indeed.I was fortunate that Agung Rai agreed to take me on the tour - yes, he took just me - so next morning I met him at 5.45am and we set off in the car. Then followed a wonderful few hours with this learned and astonishing man who showed and shared with me some of his Bali insights, knowledge and special places. We drove and walked along magnificent jungle, rice paddies and past workers and simple, uncluttered villages in the early morning light - what a privilege! Amongst so many, two highlights I could pull out for special mention were the visits to a family compound and a temple where Agung Rai patiently explained to me how families, community and rituals and traditions come together to make Bali what it is. It was a real privilege to do this tour and to meet Bak Agung Rai in this way."

We were even invited to watch children take there dance classes, which was mesmerising. They hold traditional dance performances in the evening.

I would definitely recommend a visit if you want to spend an afternoon doing something at your own pace. All in all a really nice afternoon. "

I'm not going to rate the Museum as a whole (there are plenty of reviews for that), but just want to call readers' attention to the wonderful Sunday evening performances there, every Sunday at 7:30 p.m. For 75,000 Rp. per person, we heard wonderful Balinese gamelan musicians and saw fabulous Balinese traditional dancers for about an hour and a half. The setting is stunning, outdoors in a garden at the museum. We were fortunate to be able to walk around the gardens and go into one of the buildings to see some of the art; I don't know if the latter is always allowed, but a walk on the grounds would be quite enough to make the pre-performance time special."

My wife played in a gamelan orchestra in the US for several years.This is a show for tourists, and we don't care. We heard a lot of sort of junky gamelan music coming from temples around Bali, and we wanted to see some pros. These guys were top notch. The orchestra was very tight, very talented, and it was a delight to watch how much fun they were having playing the music. The lead dancers (male and female) were incredible.The only issue were the other tourists at the show. Some were taking flash photography or talking, which was kind of annoying. But regardless, we had such a great time we could have cared less.We were worried about the quality of some of the other nightly shows in Ubud, so we did some research and arrived at a short list of shows to see that promised top quality music. This was my favorite."

We visited today with our 3 kids and there were no workshops or practices going on. We were encouraged to stroll around the resort but that felt weird as we did not know if we were intruding on peoples holidays. The prices in the shop seemed pretty over the top and overall our kids (aged 8,12 and 14) found it boring. They preferred Puri Lukisan when we came to Ubud on our last trip to Bali. They were allowed to try the gamelan instruments and i think that was the highlight for them. There were signs up stating no photos but the book they give as you enter had pictures of at least 4 visitors taking photos of the art work?? Kind of eccentric museum. Good toilets though."

Daily buffet breakfasts were included in our tariff and a chef was on hand to cook eggs, pancakes, etc exactly to our liking. We dined at the ARMA restaurants and cafe each day, despite the amazing choice of venues in Ubud Central which we drove past in the shuttle each day. A jazz night was also held in the resort on one of the nights which was also a highlight of our stay. It was absolutely divine sitting at any one of the tables overlooking the magnificent gardens and rice paddies.We enjoyed our cooking class with the very personable chef and she was on hand each day to mingle with the guests. The batik class was interesting but we struggled a little not understanding our artist teacher. The owner of the resort was present but discreet when pointing out the serene walks that guests could partake in and most nights featured traditional music or dance in one of the many stages dotted around the resort.The staff were extremely helpful and wanted to make sure we were happy - which we were!"

But what's interesting is that there's more to it than the museum...it's a complete art and culture lesson on Ubud and Bali..there are painting classes and dance classes that are conducted in the serene surroundings within the ARMA resort..it was so enriching to see little girls learn dance to the soothing beats of Balinese music..the lagoons, small rivulet flowing through and aesthetically done villas in the midst of paddy fields are all a treat to watch.. it looks like a place designed and built with a lot of passion and interest..infact it would be a great idea to stay here in ARMA resort..you could actually learn some painting and dance..for the fee of IDR 30.000, you even get to have a complimentary coffee/tea at their ARMA cafe..again very nicely done..This place is like a mini Bali within Bali..we would highly recommend it for the beauty of the place and the kaleidoscope to Balinese culture that it is !!!!"

The grounds of this enchanting estate set the pace: they are soothing and tranquil with trees and plants, many with exotic flowers. Set within are the museum buildings, one part given over to traditional Balinese art: a delight for us as Indians because the mythology is so familiar. Another building contains art that is more contemporary: look here for a dazzling painting of Bali's famous terraced paddy fields and for an old restored photograph of a noble couple from Java whish is reproduced in a painting.What is conducive to a long visit is that refreshments or a meal are available on the premises, so you don't have to rush off for food: we had a lunch at the restaurant and I would recommend that both for originality of menu as well as quality of food: prices not too bad either.

The buildings themselves are beautiful that house the paintings, the park surrounding the buildings are lovely and the fact that Agung Rai is himself present to talk to the visitors is a treat. This man had a dream at 20 years old to bring to Bali a museum to exhibit local painters and others who lived in Bali like Walter Spies. Given Rai's peasant background it was a long hard road to accomplish this mission. He and his wife have made it a world, not just a museum, within the grounds are rice fields that are cultivated, and Rai uses the museum as a cultural center for dance and music classes and performances. This place is gold. Enter into his dream."

You can hardly be overlooked, there are countless painters, sculptors, artisans and galleries ... and daily dance and gamelan performances.... And then there are in Ubud a couple of really interesting art museums ....One of these is the ARMA (Agung Rai Museum of Art) in Jalan Pengosekan.Although I always come back to Ubud for many years, I was so far not a single time in the ARMA, Big Shame on me !!!Anyway, these days I've finally found it now the way to the legendary ARMA. And what should I say? I'm totally excited now !Mr Agung Rai, the founder of the ARMA has taken several hours for me to show me the ARMA and to explain the concept of ARMA ,, which is much more than just a museum of art. And it is astonishing:: Agung Rai is not only an excellent connoisseur of art, successful gallery owner and entrepreneur, he is also a historian, archeologist, botanist, garden designer, culinary expert, and of course a great host ....and he is, as I now have seen, a true guru of sunlight !!!To uderstand what I mean, you have to come to ARMA and ask Agung Rai himself, whether you can accompany him on his spectatcular , early \"Golden Hour\" ...."

There were 4-5 meaningful pieces of art from the 100+ year old artist I Gusti Nyoman Lempad, but from an overall Bali/Ubud art perspective this museum was rather lacking. The rest (majority) of the complex consisted of the villa, caf\u00e9, and the AR gallery (art for sale). If you have plenty of time in Ubud, you could spend some time here. If you are hiring a driver to take you around or have only limited time, I would recommend skipping this and checking out the active artists' work in the shops outside of Ubud."

I could see the passion in his eyes as he spoke of the way the light landed on the leaves of the trees. Free for Balinese so bring your driver in with you. Agung kindly said I could invite my motorbike taxi driver in for a look. Great concept. Support the arts and support the preservation of Balinese culture. The art is incredible with all kinds of mediums depicting the Baliness religion, way of life and it tells a story that you would never get in Kuta or Seminyak. Local children can do free arts classes here in dance, art and crafts. Its very important this museum is preserved and continues to cultivate the important respect for the Balinese way of life.

I was working at the National Gallery in Canberra - whenever I'd visit Ubud we would get together with local artist friends and have long fascinating conversations about Balinese art and culture.I especially loved to listen to his dreams for a world standard museum in Ubud, somewhere both a permanent collection and traveling exhibitions could be displayed. He'd describe it's future landscaping to me, and we'd discuss how it might also support a foundation for the arts. There would be workshops and performances and perhaps a restaurant set deep within it's intricate gardens.A few years after those conversations I was living close to ARMA and watched it's construction. It was quite extraordinary to watch this dream come alive. And now ARMA has been open for many years. It's galleries and gardens are stunning and it's a glorious place to spend several peaceful hours, away from the mad bustle of central Ubud. Your entrance fee includes a booklet with lots of info plus a free coffee at ARMA's very pretty restaurant. Come for the art, then stay for a meal or a performance. And say hello to Agung Rai who wanders the gardens most days and is always happy to talk about this very special museum that he has created."

I had to ditch the stroller because there were steps up and down everywhere, but one of the restaurants was happy to look after it while we walked around. It was very peaceful and enjoyable to visit and I would say if you have kids with you, it's a good inclusion on your trip as they can run around in a confined place while you take in as much or as little of the culture as you need!"

The art is definitely worth the trip, as a window into the Balinese culture (which you obviously don't get in kuta). One negative point was that the galleries were neither air-conditioned or even had fans, so that's something which made our rounds here a little uncomfortable and sticky. Though they have a nice little cafe you can sit in a gazebo by the rice fields and cool down with a free cup of iced tea or coffee."

Both the contemporary and Balinese collections are great; well-exhibited in beautiful, traditionally-styled Balinese buildings. Agung Rai suggested a walk around the surrounding area -- cafes, a resort, restaurant -- probably the most exquisitely designed garden area I've seen thus far in Bali. Go for the art museum but spend at least an hour wandering around the complex."

You can short cut through there, I think. It certainly worked for me on the way out."

For instance, yesterday I sat with them and they taught me and allowed me to make the daily offerings there prepare with banana leaves...hours went by having great fun with them. They've taught me indonesian, balinese, kindly provided me with they're own staff dinner ...The people in Bali in general make it the beautiful place it is and it's all encapsulated in this one restaurant. The food I've not even mentioned...outstanding!Sumanga (hope spelt right), Suliani and Chandra are amazing people...even inviting me to they're local village for the upcoming New Year celebrations!Simply....Go!"

Its value for money and given you can stroll around the grounds of the adjoining resort and admire the landscaping and buildings at your leisure, it is great value. I didn't find the modern art section to my taste but there is still plenty to see. And as for the smiling carved stone face that is the well recognized symbol of ARMA? It's one of the very small carvings that make up some of the retaining walls on the resort. Ask one of the older staff members for its location."

I was able to meet Agung Rai himself in the gardens and he was so kind and attentive, showed me different plans that Balinese people use for healing etc. we sat and had a nice chat about Bali, one of my favorite things I have done on my trip.

Top of the list is Agung Rai Museum (and Arma resort generally). To see the collection grow over the years has been a sheer delight, not only seeing the large traditional Balinese collection but to see the outstanding collection of contemporary art work which Agung Rai and his wife collect - and continually add to the museums collection. The resort is everything exquisitely Balinese with its palpable slow down pace - the cafes are relaxing no fuss no speed - and there's plenty of cool places to sit around the resort and contemplate; and the staff are always a delight and if you 'ease' down and talk slowly with the staff you'll find their English very clear. I will be in Arma in 2015."

The Balinese art illustrates the spirit of the island. There's no one there who speaks English, so you are on your own a bit.

Mr Rai is an excellent ambassador for Balinese culture, and wanders around the museum grounds chatting to visitors and making sure they have seen everything. In addition to the range of modern and traditional art, we saw children practicing traditional dance, wood carving (and had a go at carving ourselves), a free cooling drink in the cafe, walked around the beautiful grounds and rice paddies.

We felt that all round the various halls could have been better maintained, and decorated. Whilst the art is the main thing on display, a few softening touches in the decor would be nice. The coffee shop served a limited menu, but all nice. The staff were okay. We started talking to a lovely man in the grounds who told us a little about the gallery and accompanying Foundation. When asked how he was involved, he said he was in charge of the gardens....turns out he is the founder! We found this out much later. A gentle experience which we're glad we didn't miss.

The artwork is intense, the level of craftsmanship is awe-inspiring, sometimes almost overwhelming, so we took breaks. We had tea seated against cushions in a pavilion overlooking the ricefield, wandered some more, and then had a late lunch at the Thai restaurant. It was all fabulous. We\u2019ll go back on Sunday evening for the Barong and Keris dance performance."

There are three important art museums in Ubud and it's hard to say which is the best, but a visit to Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA) is certainly a very enjoyable experience. Even if you're not all that interested in art, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this complex of museum, cafe, performance area and boutique resort. Set in spacious grounds, planted with tropical trees, orchids, gingers and other shrubs, many of which are conveniently labelled, the museum itself offers a timeline of the development of Balinese art, from the early Wayang style of monochrome painting based on Hindu legend, to the 20th century and the influence of foreign artists who settled in the area, to contemporary Balinese painters and sculptors. Take time to enjoy it, then visit the cafe for the free tea of coffee that comes with your entrance ticket."

The soothing sounds of the fountains relaxed my spirit & opened my mind to the beauty that surrounded me. Stone sculpture frosted in soft green moss & decorated with flower offerings, pools graced with bright pink lotus flowers, elegant orchids in a variety of colors, all set the stage for the breathtaking art within the museum. Bali has to be an artist's dream place to express art. The color & the beauty can be see everywhere. In the natural flora & fauna, the rice fields, the deep river ravines, the jungle, the architecture, & the beauty of its people. All this & more is beautifully displayed on the walls of the ARMA. Take the time to treat yourself to the visual feast. You will find that it will refresh your soul."

For those who aren't interested in art, the grounds of ARMA are full of beautiful gardens and stonework carving structures. In the afternoons they also have children learning to play the Balinese instruments and classes that cover other cultural aspects of traditional Balinese life/culture. The entrance fee is $6 AUD and this includes a complimentary drink at the Museum Caf\u00e9 and also a booklet about ARMA. This place is privately owned and they do a lot of good work to encourage the Balinese traditions in art and culture to be taught to the local children.

Today, I can't really afford what they show, but their art is definitely top-notch and worth a look. Some of the pieces are so beautiful, I long to afford them and wish I could just ship them all home. I think ARMA is one of the best art studios in Ubud if not in Bali overall. If you are in Ubud, it's worth stopping by. ARMA is easy to find on one of the main roads."

We went there rather late in the afternoon and only had a bit over an hour there (after our driver mistakenly took us to another Museum of Art in the area). It offers a nice walk in a peaceful and settled garden, traditional Indonesian buildings, contemporary and traditional paintings. rice fields, hotel resort villas. simply a nice walk! We were not really into art but found the glances of paintings gave us a quick and broad but immense wonder of Indonesian cultural. I am still wondering why so many objects are cramped in a painting and often the distance dimension/perspective is not so much illustrated...Highly recommend those who like to walk in nature, don't mind to do a bit of art museum to go. For my teenage nephew, he found it was a bit boring."

Can see that this area is quieter and caters to tourists who seek the crafts & arts of Bali as the area is lined with wood crafts, art galleries & stone sculptures vendors. The art museum is not worth the travelling time invested because the variety is few, many of the same type--which is Bali inspired which depict Ramayana folklores & way of life in Bali. Seriously need some updates & proper maintenance. But the entrance fee is a mere IRD 60k, so don't expect too much."

ARMA\u2019s pieces are from the private collection of Agung Rai and so the collection is not comprehensive, a little quirky, and includes reproductions (most notably the works of Walter Spies) that might put off some visitors looking for a more formally curated museum. However, there is a substantial collection of Balinese paintings and art starting from the 1940s as well as contemporary works housed on two floors in two large pavilions, so don\u2019t be misled by reviewers who claim that there is nothing to see. For Rp 60,000, there is a substantial collection of Balinese paintings, a free drink at the museum caf\u00e9, an opportunity to stroll some of the most beautiful resort property you will find and also the chance to eavesdrop on any artistic events that may be going on when you are there. We lingered for several hours.ARMA is not only about its paintings. Judging from its promotional materials, it aims to be a hip arts community hangout where people can appreciate being surrounded by beauty however you define it and in our experience it succeeds. As we were about to enter the first museum building, we were directed by one of the friendly staff to first look around the grounds. The landscaping and architecture outside were as much a part of the experience, he said, and helped to provide a better understanding of the paintings inside. Sure enough, the grounds are stunning, with luxurious accommodations set amid tropical gardens and adjoining picturesque rice fields. As you look around, you will notice that some of the trees and flowers have been curated too in arboretum style with labels, just like the paintings, to keep you well-informed on your tropical flora. My wife and I admired the bridges, waterfalls, statues and exquisite displays of flowers and plants in the gardens and dreamed about which of the incredible rooms we would choose on our next trip to Ubud. I was quite taken by the two story open air bungalow set off to itself with stepping stones across what first appeared to be a lawn but what was actually a pond covered with finely textured water plants. Incredible.Finally, after passing through the museum, we were treated to music from the 2014 Ubud Jazz Festival. We had seen the signs all around town, but didn\u2019t realize until we arrived at the museum that ARMA was hosting it, which made complete sense. Visitors should go to ARMA with the understanding that it is not your typical stuffy museum but a contemporary resort celebrating the beauty of the arts."

Have a cup of tea and enjoy the museum grounds and surrounding rice fields. But do enjoy the artworks while you're there. Not a huge collection, but well considered, reflecting the development of a range of different styles in Bali over time, and the interactions between Balinese and European approaches. Check out a dance performance if you can...or have a chat to the very personable Agung Rai if he is there...he often is. In summary, a consistently lovely place to visit."

I just regret that I could not eat at the larger cafe near the car park or at their Thai restaurant, will do so next visit.Downtown Ubud streets were overrun with tourists and resembled a parking lot with cars barely inching their way the day we visited, don't spend much time there but visit this museum."

While we were there, we saw young girls learning to dance traditional Balinese dance, as well as a foreigner learning how to play the Balinese xylophone, surrounded by other gamelan instruments. We had drinks in the garden and while my fellow visitors felt the trees were all a bit overgrown, I marveled at the beauty of all these tropical trees, shrubs and flowers spilling over one another in an organically orchestrated way.

There is an air of calm and serenity about this place, located only a road away from a busy street, but once your within its gardens it's as if your in a different world. The place is a mix between art within the walls - mainly painting and occasional sculptures (which are all beautiful) - and designs outside in the gardens. We spoke to a older gentlemen who worked there and he seemed so wise and at peace, he spoke of how the place was created to be in balance with nature, to be educational in a simplistic, creative and inspirational way. It is a place where even the old stone statues outside are 'painted by nature, glazed by moss'...Definitely visit and journey down to the river too! (Plus there is a Free drink included within the price of your ticket, well worth it at one of their beautiful and picturesque caf\u00e9s)...."

When I got in , the first thing I witnessed was a group of youngsters learning traditional Balinese dancing from 3 lovely teachers . I stayed there for 20 minutes admiring the lovely moves under the sounds of a live band of 6 musicians . I then continued by following the recommended itinerary shown on the map given to me at the entrance and found myself in a beautiful environment of rice fields , gardens , river and buildings of Balinese architecture with music being played from an unknown origin ! I then went after one hour in this lovely setting to have a cup of cold coffee (included in the entrance fee ) noticing the preparations for a wedding ceremony to be performed later ! I learned from the waiter that normally there are some traditional dancing shows being performed on Sundays but it had been cancelled today because of the wedding ! My visit ended by a 2 hour tour of the Museum where both traditional and modern paintings are displayed in a very well organized setting and in a cool environment (meaning AC) ! A very interesting half day visit !"

All aspect in Balinese painting that you enjoy at his museum, comes alive when you spend sometimes outside the museum building, but within the museum compound.

We found here at the end of a hot walk, entered the peace of a large garden and took the opportunity to have an iced coffee which was complementary with the entry cost (around $7au). Finding ourselves less than able to expend the energy we wandered around for a fairly short while and then treated ourselves to a long lunch perched high off the ground in one of the on site restaurants.We weren't satisfied with our performance (not enough looking) so returned first thing the next day to give it our best shot. The grounds were indeed peaceful and this time there was many artisans showing their creations and how they were achieved sitting within the gardens or in small pavilions. Leaving there we entered the world of what is Bali art, both historically and in its development over the last several decades. We found a lot to really impress and much to admire.If you are in Ubud, please take the time to look, it is well worth the attention, you may be even lucky enough to have a conversation with Mr Agung Rai."

The garden itself is lush and filled with artwork and beautiful landscape. The rooms/ villas seem very private and set in beautiful surroundings.

The entrance fee included a drink at their coffee shop: either tea or coffee and we had iced coffee. A perfect foil for the heat. What really took my breath away was the featured artist this month of February, Jan Peter Van Opheusden. I just couldn't get enough of his paintings. I wanted to photograph some of his works but signs said no picture taking. I was so happy his books were available for sale at the museum. Their brochure also mentioned 2-3 hour classes in batik, silver jewelry, Balinese architecture, dance and so much more. Just perfect for short stay tourists."

The entry fee seemed a tad expensive, but the museum delivers what it promises - housing paintings from the early 1900s through to modern times and themes.I wonder if it would be good to have a guide to the paintings, as many of the themes are specifically Hindu, especially in the older paintings, and I couldn't help but wonder if I had missed out on the essence of some of the paintings that weren't about mundane subjects.The museum also houses a lot of Walter Spies' work. Also, a ticket to the museum gets you a complimentary tea/coffee by the paddy fields at Warung Kopi.Works of Paul Husner are being housed at ARMA right now, and in my opinion, are a spectacular window into the Balinese way of life."

Many of the works were very recent with some on display only having been painted this year. We thought there was much more to the museum but a lot of it is just the resort, restaurant and other enterprises.

I do admire its well maintained vast complex a tranquil sanctuary with strong Balinese architecture and landscape; and later I learn that it is often chosen the venue of world class events. Its marvelous orchid collection tickles me to spend some time admiring them. Two carvers were commissioned onsite (in a designated pavilion) to work on crafted doors. Lucky me \u2026 I had the chance to talk to them and gave a try. It turns out that carving is not that easy (at least for me). Lovely paintings of famous local (Balinese and Indonesian) and foreigner painters (painting Indonesian topics) are nicely displayed. I was very attracted to the \u201cNobleman\u201d painted by Raden Saleh (Indonesian painter - and \u201cCalon Arang\u201d by Walter Spies. The latter, a Javanese/Balinese folklore, was greatly depicted by this German painter. Amazing\u2026\u2026If I get a chance to go to Ubud again, I will spare more time to admire its collections.

We found we tired after awhile of all of the traditional Balinese themes (Ramayana pictures, lots of Barong pictures), but our favorite part of the museum was the contemporary section. One of the highlights is a massive 'painting' that is actually a multi-media exhibit--a huge representation of rice fields at harvest, with the rice stalks, etc., consisting of melted strands of colored fibre. A wonderful bonus for the foot-weary traveler is the gracious afternoon tea that is supplied with your entrance fee. The Warung Kopi served beautifully decorated lattes and cakes, and we were seated cross-legged on airy, roofed platforms overlooking the adjacent rice fields. Fantastic!"

His mastery of the piano...wow! like magic fingers...smooth as silk.We truly enjoy his music. The rest of the musicians are also great. Most local talent and we believe Indonesia have many talented people and artists. The government need to sponsor more such events.There was another band that fuse western and traditional Balinese instruments and it was just the perfect match. Bali should win a prize for creativity. Bali should be cited as world heritage just for her people alone; warmth and talented...is there such an award? the thais are friendly and hospitable but Balinese, warmth and talented...in every aspect of art...stone, wood, silver...you name it and they have it...;)Now, we will visit the jazz festival again if it is organised next year.You should go too.

There was a combination of traditional Balinese sculptures and paintings as well as contemporary art. The location is beautiful with rice fields on one end and big gardens surrounding the museum galleries. There were different arts and crafts that you could take part in. The entry fee is relatively expensive compared to what you'd expect to pay in Bali but you get a complimentary drink at the coffee shop. Worth a visit!!"

The attached resort grounds are spacious, and there's a gift shop, so you can pass a very pleasant couple of hours.The art collection, extensive as it is, with European works inspired by Bali as well as Balinese, is not well curated. (Some works do rotate, as the owners of this museum are gallery owners.) The collection does not have the same breadth, depth, historical perspective or importance as those at the Neka and the Puri Lukisan in Ubud. So if you only visit one museum, I'd chose one of the others. If however, you love museums, this is not one to pass up."

We returned the following day to take a woodcarving class...just me, my husband and our teacher. It was a truly unique experience, and I loved learning even a little of this stunning art form."

Oh, and for the sheer fact of the presence, within its walls, of what is probably the sole, authentic Walter Spies painting on public view in Bali. While the ARMA is a bit wanting in the curatorial department \u2013 there are precious few explanatory wall texts or labels to be spotted, as well as an entire gallery of er, reproductions of Spies paintings \u2013 the strength of its displays, and the broad scope of its collection are pretty impressive. The usual suspects are also here, of course: there was a temporary exhibition of contemporary Batuan paintings while I was there (accompanied by a thick catalogue, terribly imposing), and you get plenty of mythological subjects on cloth, depictions of everyday scenes and lush forestscapes and stylized animals, and ghosties and ghoulies and black magic hokum, as well as works executed in that shining exemplar of Indonesian art, the Mooi Indie style. It\u2019s when one gets to the annexe next to the main building, though, that things really take off: the Spies, a rendering of the Calonarang folktale, is here, as is a vaguely Matisse-esque painting of loincloth-clad Balinese men by Dutch artist Auke Sonnega, the whole affair just simmering with Bazille-ian homoeroticism. There are also more recent pieces: large-scale conceptual work by Walter van Oel, and stuff from Singaporean artists (look out for the still-life by Wee Shoo Leong - brilliant). Oh, and the price of admission includes a free cuppa joe. Real nice of these guys."

However, we found the sprawling grounds to be incredibly tranquil and well kept. The art itself was a lovely collection and we had the opportunity to meet Agung Rai who really inspired us to see the \"art in nature\". Bali is truly a beautiful place. We were lucky that they were featuring new art with the launch of a new book (Inventing Art: the Paintings of Batuan Bali) and so we were able to purchase an original piece.Free coffee or tea with admission ticket at the lovely cafe. We were tempted to eat lunch at the Thai restaurant onsite and I still dream about the wonderful villas that you can stay in. Heavenly retreat. A nice way to see Balinese art in its purest form amidst lovely surroundings. We spent way more time walking the grounds than we did looking at art, but the experience was wonderful."

A bit of a walk (always a challenge in motorbike clogged Ubud) from the village center but not too far from the Monkey Forest is a real find: the Agung Rai Museum of Art. The grounds are quiet and serene, a wonderful respite from the sometimes crazy streets of Ubud. We are not art buffs, but still enjoyed the gallery and it had a good variety of works from earlier centuries to more recent additions. The coffee shop was a great place to spend an our (or two) and the admission ticket includes a free cup of (hot or iced) coffee or tea. We also went back in the evening for a dance performance. I'm not a connoisseur of Balinese dance, but the dancers seemed enthusiastic and the length of the performance was just right. Good English-language programs kept us informed about what we were watching. Ordinarily the dance is held on an outdoor stage which I'm sure adds something to its not already inconsiderable charms, but the threat of rain moved it indoors to the gallery lobby. Somehow being surrounded by modern Balinese art provided an even more interesting backdrop for the performance. Lots of good dance troupes and venues in Ubud, but I would recommend this one."

We went to ARMA looking for a unique experience and we found it!Tired of the usual tourist traps we wanted to learn a little bit more about Balinese dancing and the Gamelan. Inspired as well by the beautiful Balinese dances we saw and the entrancing Gamelan Orchestra music we asked around and were surprised to find that very few people knew about ARMA.A bit of a gamble but worth taking at such reasonable prices. The Gamelan and Dance workshops cost us $25 US each but lasted for 2 hours. We made sure we came at a quiet time, 1100 AM and had the instructors one-on-one which helps if your Bahasa Indonesia is a bit rusty. We were told that they do cater for larger groups as well.Knowing the Indonesian language would be an advantage but even if you didn't you would still find this a remarkable experience. This would be an ideal excursion for students of the Indonesian Language at any level.Definitely a wonderful experience and created a desire to learn more at a later time...worth a try!"

I didn't like the ex-Bali paintings at all, not one of them! Soul-less stuff. (Hence 4 not 5 stars!) However, I could have spent many more hours with the Balinese work. Supremely beautiful, tender, exquisite soft colours, and a good range from quite old paintings to modern ones. Mind-boggling detail on large canvases, scenes from religious and personal life, depicted of deities and people and animals. Don't miss the large wooden Rama-Sita, carved from a hibiscus tree.... beyond beautiful, it is luminous, transpersonal and yet utterly human in its portrayal of intimacy. Also don't miss the Kecak trance-dance troupe who perform there on the lunations (New and Full Moons) ... reputed to be the best. I've seen them many times and never fail to be inspired."

The artwork is quite remarkable, most of it based on Hindu legends so there is some redundancy but the work is high quality and there is some diversity of content. The buildings themselves are interesting too.The 3-5 Balinese dance lessons are worth seeing but probably not hanging around for.

This museum features an eclectic collection of Balinese art, together with some European and Javanese art in a smaller side building. The main building's collection is great, featuring pre-war Balinese art (including I Gusti Nyoman Lempad and contemporaries), some double-ikat weaving displays, a feature on Walter Spies (albeit reproductions of works) and a very good collection of post-war Balinese art. The earlier art on the second level interested me more, though the more modern art was also worthwhile seeing. The second building, featuring mainly non-Balinese art that tended to be more aligned with Western art, was not as interesting and I skipped some of the works. There was also a temporary exhibition on the ground floor of the entrance building whose subject was owls, which held some interest for me.Conservation practices are better here than in the Puri Lukisan Museum in Ubud and works of art tend to be in a much better condition overall. I would rate this museum as slightly better as Lukisan, though the latter has some pre-20th century art.The entrance fee is Rp 40000 per person and includes a coffee from the cafe behind the main art building. The collection is quite extensive, so allow 1.5-2 hours to see most things."

In addition to the museum, and two open stages for dance performances, the compound includes a resort area with what looked to be rather swanky bungalows fronting the rice fields. The caretaker told us that the place had been neglected for some years and was only now seeing some money come in to refurbish some of the buildings. Few people seem to visit this place; other than us, I saw two others and they did not make the journey down to the rest of the compound.

Lots of specialists wood carvers working their skills all over the compound when we were there. I guess the Museum itself was having a refurbishment.

The paintings are far from what I was used to seeing. Took my time, soaked up the atmosphere. Your entrance ticket comes with a free coffee or tea. After taking my time at the 2 museums I sat and enjoyed my tea reading the newspaper. One of the employees told me I should go down to the ARMA resort because they have a beautiful watergarden there. So I did and he was right ... beautiful indeed. I also sat and watched the childeren's danceclass (3 pm). Before heading back home I informed about their workshops. Turns out the ARMA has plenty of them so if you want to really learn about Bali doing one of the workshops might be fun. I booked a danceclass which was a lot of fun (you just have to tell the teacher to slow down the pase sometimes). All in all I spent a little over 4 hrs. there the first time and the danceclass was 2 hrs. Well worth a visit."
