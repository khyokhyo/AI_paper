(IMO these were better/more entertaining than in Atlantis, And therefore we went here 2 times)Many places to sit, and a lot of shady places (the sun was brutal towards Norwegian skin, in early October) Food was OK. We only tried fried chicken, and some snow-cone/slush-drinksWardrobe-areas and showers was ok, (similar to Atlantis) Clean and not to crowded.Payment-system was (similar to Atlantis) very smart. You get a wrist-band witch can be \"charged with money\" so that there is no need to bring cards or cash in the park. Whatever if left/not used will get refunded to you when you leave.No need to book ahead online here, pay when you arrive was most convenient! (we tried both)The surface on the ground (smooth rock) was not too slippery, and not as hot to walk bare-feet on as in Atlantis (in Atlantis I would recommend some sort of shoes/sandals!)"

Try to get in early for a more exclusive time at the park. If your kids love water, this is a great place to visit. Couldn't go on most of the rides because I had small children with me. But believe me, you can spend the whole day having fun with just a few rides.Changing rooms were adequate although a bit crowded, food is quite expensive.The queue for a taxi when getting out is also pretty long."

            "review": "Not overly impressed at all. . Positives- My 2 year old thoroughly enjoyed the wave pool and tube floats. - Some of the food was nice. Negatives- The food. It was incredibly overpriced, staff were very poorly trained with no obvious managerial support, extended wait times and either poor quality and/or small portions. - Visitors are not welcome to bring their own food or drink into the park forcing guests to buy everything, including water. - Ticket pricing. Overpriced. - I am six months pregnant, was charged full entry fee and then denied access to use a slide in the children's area. I spent the day in the wave pool and tube floats. Despite being fit and healthy with a low risk pregnancy, I knew I'd be turned away from any other activity (not that I'd even contemplate the thrill seeker ones). With this in mind, my entry ticket price was a total rip off. A 'spectator fee' would be far more appropriate. - The children's play area. Where to begin... It's an area specifically for those under 1.1 metres tall yet was not age appropriate at all. Throughout the area, constantly and without warning, you have a deluge of water dumped on you. It was unnecessary and painful (for both me and my daughter), not to mention scary for the little ones. Constant water/sprinkler jets are fine, kids seem to quite like them, but I think Wild Wadi has too many. Adults were not allowed to ride on even the most basic of slides with the child. Adults are welcome to slide before or after the child, just one is not to enter the slide until the other is off the other end. With a noticeable baby bump I was told I was refused entry to any of the slides in the children's area. In my opinion this area is currently appropriate for children aged approximately 6-10 years old, yet this is the age group I saw being turned away from due to their height. My normally brave, gutsy and outgoing two year old was in tears screaming after having masses of water dumped on her head and did not feel comfortable at all to use a slide by herself. As such the whole children's area was off limits for us. Many other visitors to the park appeared to be having the same issues. All in all, I think our money would have been better spent elsewhere."

We visited recently, we enjoyed the rides, staff was pleasant.Even though it says 30 rides, there are not nearly that many for adults. We enjoyed them and since the day was not crowded we were able to do them several times.Several of the tube type rides are nice for couples. The new Jumeriah Scremiah is intense and I enjoyed it with the short lines was able to do it twice.The end of the visit was marred by an accident, when my wife went to use a public shower to rinse off, the shower head fell off and hit her in the head when she pressed the button to start the water. The shower heads are large and it left a large lump. not sure ow a metal shower head just falls off, but it did.Only after us walking out of the treatment area in frustration did they offer to pay for treatment at a local hospital and no offer at all of free tickets/refund or any type of compensation for ruining the day."

Staffs are kind and they kept taking photos for us so we can collect the printed photos at their shop before leaving. The guy in the photo shop cheated on us about the printing price. The deal was 300 AED for 5 prints with a bar code which stores all photos we can download from their website. The staff keeps telling us the bar code is free if we buy their printed photos. We bought one print for 110 AED (the original price was 125, but they promised us a discount). The thing is after payment he returned my card and told us the bar code only contains one copy of the photo. We argued with them because they did not tell us about this otherwise we would not buy it at all. The reason I gave a terrible rating is not only they cheated on the agreement, but also when we negotiating about this, he knows we want the code with all photos but asks do we still want to keep it, I was hesitating and he just threw it with no reason. I would recommend using your own camera instead of their photo services."

The rides were great too. They have rapid rides were you sit in like a doughnut ring and it shoots you up and down various slides all around the waterpark. You must try the Jumeirah Sceirah! Even if you're a tad scared, it's an experience you won't forget! Lastly, as the sun sets about half 6 and you look up to see a view of the Burj Al Arab with a pink sky, you forget where you are and it makes visiting Wild Wadi that even bit special. Enjoy!"

The double dinghies really help if your child is a little anxious about going on the slides. The price for food and photos is really expensive inside. A single photo was costing \u00a355.00 .My kids aged 9-10yrs learned to surf on a board with some really friendly instructor. The ques can be long but really worth it. I've been coming here each time Ive visited Dubai kids love the slides and have a blast a here every time!"

Pleasantly, the wait times on all the rides was very short with only 1 ride with a 15-minute wait. My son who is taller than 1.1m was able to go on all the slides in my company! That was really a big differentiator for me as he is in the age where the kids slides are boring and he may not be allowed on bigger slides in other parks requiring 1.2/1.3m. In this respect, Wild Wadi was perfect for us. To avoid carrying cash, you can charge your bracelet with credit in advance that allows you to buy food and reserve a locker. The ticket employee did not inform me that there were different locker sizes so I ended up overspending in that department. Wild Wadi staff were very understanding in that regard and very cooperative. We were even offered ice cream in compensation which made a big difference for my son!Car Parking also available and within immediate proximity (no need for a transport from parking to park)."

I don't know whether it was because the fee charge is less than the normal fee, the staff is already tired? Because of our brown skin? They are very strict on the \"no taking picture\" rule. But we see alot of muslim ladies taking pictures and even videos.... So.... Although i love it that there is not a lot of people on queiu, but still i would say that the staff reception we received last thursday was not par with last 4 years ago. With the many theme parks available, i think the only real competition here is how the staff will receive the guests. And wild wadi failed in that category."

Went on a weekend in September and the queues were quite small - max wait of 15mins on the busier rides (ie the thrill rides). Food options were a little limited and mostly consisted of burgers chips or similar variations. Has a couple of high-thrill rides, but would be better suited to families."

LocationThe park is located near the Burj Al Arab which is away from the main part of Dubai. Their is a little Mall near by and a Mcdonalds Drive by about 5 minutes by car from the water park. The park is on the beach, but you have no access to the beach. It is roughly a 20/30 minute drive by car from JBR.Avoid this park on a Friday and Saturday as it is Dubais weekend and is busy. I went mid week at the time of opening 9am, it was quiet. We were ready to leave by 2pm, at which time the park was getting busy.Water ParkYou are apparently not allowed food into the park, i was not searched.On entrance their is a height test 1m- if your over you pay and are allowed to access all rides. If under your free to enter park.You pay for a locker- non refundable. Changing rooms are largeThe park has rides/water/play areas for all children including babies. They have sun beds all over mainly sutuated at points of interest e.g. by the fake beach/water activities etc which are free. I would advise to bring aqua shoes which are \u00a35 in the UK as you can wear them in the park without your feet burning when walking between rides. Bring your own towels or pay for theres.Either from UK of from the Wild Wadi shop in the park please purchase a water phone bag which hangs on your neck. It is completely waterproof. \u00a325 in park.Life guards are plentiful, life vests are provided where needed if needed for free.The park does have a VIP cabanas which also allows beach access. This is for 8 people- overpriced at \u00a3300 or \u00a3400 UK GBP not including park tickets.Rides:The rides are good/Ok and my teenage neices had completed all the rides in the park in about 3 hours. After that they got a bit bored. The children under 10 could stay all day splashing in the water.All in all, rides were good for all ages.Food:Fried chicken Fast food - over pricedIndian fast food - anyone that has tasted UK indian food knows this is not indian. Over pricedGrilled chicken and Pizza- over priced.No restaurant style place to eat, all fast food.Clothing:People were in Burkinis/Bikinis/Rashers and or speedos.Taxi:Plentiful outside the park.I had the Dubai entertainer app, buy 1 get 1 Wild wadi ticket free. The savings here alone paid for the app and some!.Keep an eye on your kids, easy to lose them."

The park is compact, so less walking which was fantastic! Aqua venture was a killer on the feet!! The food was ok - hot chips were a HIT @ both parks. Quite a big tub of watermelon for $35UAE and it was fresh and yummy. This park has one thriller ride, Jumeriah scierah - wow, so thrilling, scary, fun & has fantastic views from the top!!!!

The tourist buses will talk you round all the other attractions before dropping you off near your hotel or the mall.You can spend the whole day at this attraction but due to the Dubai sun I'd recommend only 4 hours. The waterpark is completely set up to assist you staying in the shade with shade covers on all queues. The queues weren't too bad for most of the rides, unless you really want to, I wouldn't bother with the queue jumpers.My favourite ride was the capsule one (not sure of the ride name), it is truly a thrilling experience.This attraction is a must for any thrill seekers in Dubai!"

For some reason the machine that produces these thrilling waves has been turned right down to the point it is barely a swell. Such a shame. I may visit Atlantis on my next trip instead."

So many different rides, a area for the children, places to just sit and relax and many water sports to get involved in also. I dont swim and i am a little scared of water but i was at ease knowing im being watched incase i slip up. Food?? Nkt the best to be honest. Pizza OK (ish) but other than that its just about filling your self up. Id say food is 3 out of 10. Other than that the place overall is awesome. Please go if you in dubai. Prices are 295 dirams over 1.1 metres high and 250 below 1.1 metre so a average of 60 uk pounds per person."

Once I arrived yesterday in Wild Wadi I purchased a locker , went there with my wife , so after she changed I went to mens changing room and there were an issue with a locker , I just simply couldnt use any of lockers and the one I used couldnt open after , all my things were stuck in there , I've spoke to one of the guys from park who was there to try to fix my issue but then he took me to some other place to speak to some other guy named James ( all best comments about him , very polite and helpful ) , than I've been told to go back with him to locker to see whats happening , once we got there he start kicking locker with his hand and trying to open and he opened it. Where I've been told that its working , on my big surprise there was manager and few other staff around us , and I've said that I don't really want everytime I need something from locker to kick door with my hand and hope that door will open , and that I just arrived and I've spent 1 hour trying to fix issue with my locker while my wife is waiting me outside on heat wondering whats going on, they said we will give you another locker which took another 20 minutes of waiting. However I got another locker , very very very bad experience at very begging of visit and for my big surprise manager made it even more bad since he didnt even talk to me , he didnt even apologize for the issue I have what was horrible from side of someone on high position as him. Overall park is very nice and rides are good , safety on high level , just this issue made me very upset since its wasting of my time spending more than 1 hour for an issue simple like that. I don't think that this kind of issue should take that much time to fix and even more not making me walk here and there with them when they can do it on their own in very faster period. I am very unhappy with my visit only because first impression was very badd."

This time we visited the park seeking an adventure without the children, it was wonderful. My husband and I had just as much fun together here as the children would usually. We went on All of the rides including the infamous Jumeirah Sceirah and the other scary rides. Some of the rides now have weight restrictions, tantrum alley and /or Burj Surj. This wasn't managed as best as possible with lots of people forming additional queues at the entrance to the ride because they were waiting for the right couple to team with / making the right group weight to be allowed access to the ride. In the past 2 people could go on a 4 person 4 but now it has to be 4 and a group of 4 with the Right weight. This was Long but we got there in the end. It could be managed better by posting the recommended weight at the beginning of the queue so people can add themselves before queuing. Could also advertise for male/female pairs or male/female and 2 children. Then people have an idea how to proceed. The ride itself is Awesome. Scary and risky and totally enjoyable. Tips: you only live once... Try the Jumeirah Sceirah... Yikes!!If you're a hotel guest TAKE the hotel shuttle which is a golf trolley enabling direct access to the park w/out more queues.Good luck!

The wave pool compared to water parks in the US was disappointing.We had free access from hotel and found it best to go in first thing at 10 when it was quieter no queues and choice of sunbeds till around 12 when starts to get busy.We would have booked our holiday for different dates had we known the water park was open till 10 pm on a Friday June to September - we missed this.We took bottles of water in from hotel you couldn't take in any other food and drink."

It was very warm (about 40c) so we weren't expecting to get wowed by this place at all. But what a pleasant trip. Easy to get in and several water 'rides' or areas suitable for 4 and 2 year olds. Kids had a good time. Food selection is very little but pretty decent quality. Biggest downside is if you lose a member of your group it is difficult to locate them. Place is huge and noisy. And there is no announcement system. Understandable as there's alot of water noise topped with people enjoying themselves (or scared senseless) screaming their heads off.Would I pay \u00a360 per person with such young kids. No. That would be dumb. "

Me and my family always have an amazing time at Wild wadi Waterpark!It was now our 4th time at the Waterpark and it becomes better each time!We spent most of our time on the shoot slides that connect to the lazy river at the end. On this ride it connects to all different slides so you don't have to step out of your float- it is all of my family's favourite ride(s)!The lifeguards are very alert and friendly! In my personal opinion I would say that the Waterpark, in terms of rides and food, is better then the Atlantis Waterpark, which we visited last year! The food is good but a little bit pricey!I will be returning to Wild Wadi Waterpark again- for my 5th visit, we cannot wait!!"

I probably expected too much, because the rides are great fun, the staff are helpful and friendly, and it's modern, up to date and clean. The fast food restaurants aren't great, the food quality is poor, but I do realise that it's a water park not a food destination. My kids loved it, so it's probably just me, but I couldn't help thinking there was something missing. I'm sure if you want to splash about in the hot sunshine and that you don't expect too much that you'll enjoy it."

            "review": "Visit it at least once. We have visited the park many times in the last years and it is always in our list with the things to do when we spend our vacations at Dubai. This year two new waterslides were ready, actually they are two identical slides side by side. It has a lot of rides and you can easily spend a whole day there. There are slides where three or four persons can use the same tube. The park is very clean overall. If you are visiting the park, avoid Thursdays and Fridays which is the equivalent of Saturday and Sunday, or public holidays. At those days the park is overcrowded. Snacks are reasonable priced. One suggestion for drinks, is to buy one of those drinking cups which can be refilled for free. For a day\u2019s visit you can have the AED 75 option, with which you get unlimited free refills for a single day, or if you are staying at any Jumeirah hotel, you can have the AED 100 option with which you get unlimited free refills during your whole stay at the hotel. Both options are valid for soft drinks and water. The first time we have visited the park was in 2012 and the water was really cool and enjoyable. Since then, almost every year the water is slightly warmer than the previous one. This year the water temperature was higher than comfortable and this is the opinion of our whole family. I do not know why they don\u2019t keep the water temperature cool anymore. However, we have noticed this happening to other waterparks in the area. Another change this year, was the replacement of some beds with chairs. You cannot really spend a day sitting on a chair, squeezed in rows like a theatre and every time someone wants to get out, you have to either stand up or pull your feet together to make way. There are lifeguards all over the place which are very watchful especially at pool areas and they behave professionally. Despite that, in one of the slides which move you upwards using water jet, the jets did not manage to push my tube up the slide and it started going backwards and then forwards again. This was repeated for two or three cycles. The riders of a double tube coming behind me at full speed hit me very hard at the head with their feet. Then the guards hit the emergency stop. The park looks to have very high safety standards and this is one of the reasons we visit it. Since the back and forth of my tube lasted for some time I believe it should have been noticed by the guards earlier and they should have pushed the emergency stop some seconds earlier. Overall, if you are in Dubai with your family and kids, you must visit the waterpark."

I felt redundant as a parent on this occasion as my child spent hours on flow rider. So we just nipped to and fro from the rides to check every now and then. This place is so clean ,safe and fun for all ages. I prefer wild wadi to Atlantis water park.

We started with the Sceirah and that was worth the price of admission. all the rides were great and no wait time...probably because we went in August. It took me awhile to realize the drink deals that you could get, so do some research. there is an unlimited drink that you can get but you need to carry it around, I think...we paid dearly but you need it to cool off and keep hydrated. My son had a some medical issues and many staff were there to help so this was really nice. Finding shaded places to sit and relax is difficult unless you pay for the private cabanas, so wear an old hat and keep hydrated, the rides are totally worth it."

Family raft rides are superb, (spectacular views from the tower at the top of the queue for this ride, particularly of the 7 star Burj al Arab hotel), and a little scary particularly the bowl slide aspect which really turns your stomach upside down! Plenty of lifeguards around in each area and they are very vigilant. A positive thing, but it meant that the wave machine in the main pool was hardly ever on as when they blew their whistle at anyone it was turned off for what seemed like ages. We bought a refillable cup which was invaluable and able to fill up with any soft drink at any kiosk. At the entrance, there was the option of loading a wrist band with some money to spend around the park. We didn't do this which was a mistake as it meant that it was a trip back to the locker every time we needed to buy something. At the end of the day any money not spent on it is refunded.Food was really delicious. Ordered a pizza for children which was huge. Food not cheap but in line with what you would expect to pay at any main attraction.Loads of sun bed and parasol availability even though quite busy.On balance a great fun day out when hot, though you may be a tad ,tad disappointed if expecting the scale of Florida's Blizzard Beach/Typhoon Lagoon."

Avoid Friday's as it over crowded.First getting to wild wadi park is a bit of a mission if you don't know how the metro work's.get off at the mall of the emirates and then find the exist that lead's to the bus stand and catch the no 81 which take's you near the park,,, From the bus stop its about 10 min walk.Admission fee's are high AED 295 and AED 250 for kids. But having a voucher which entitle's you a bogof option.Locker's are charged at 45 aed and food at 60+ per meal.Rides are fun and safe. children have a separate area and have plenty to do.Only down side is the ticket price."

My kids loved the Jameria Scriaha and the corn cups! It is still good for tots. But an expensive day out. Make the most of it and go early to get a good sunbed. Also worth doing the refillable juice cup. They don't let you take food and drink in so if you want to sneak some in- be very discrete! We went twice and the weekends are busier so avoid if you can. Be prepared to queue for rides and food..if you can buy the Dubai voucher booklets (about (\u00a350) you get Bogof for here and loads of restaurants including the Atlantis - worth the investment and research before you go. Dubai is not cheap for a family holiday....."

The Jumeirah Scarer is still the best ride in Dubai and is now fully enclosed making it much safer. The location is much closer to everything than Aquaventure which is stuck out on the Palm and means you only have a short journey home after. Once you've parked you're not far away from the changing facilities, unlike Aquaventure and it's cheaper and more compact. If you're taking children you might want to get a swimming t shirt to ensure they don't get too much sun exposure waking between the rides. Great family day out for all the kids and big kids!"

It's perfect for thrill seekers as there's loads of big rides, and it's also great for families with young children.As it's always been busy when I've been the queues can be quite long so you must make sure you arrive early and stay until closing! If you go when the days are shorter, by the time the park shuts it becomes dark so you can see the Burj al Arab light up as you leave.A must-do in Dubai!"

We had free admission due to a special deal with the hotel we were staying at, but had I paid for a family of 4, I would not consider it to be good value.Despite the hype, there really are only 4 waterslides if you ignore the children's area. The Tantrum Alley was the best with the Burj Surj a close second. The high water slide with the vertical drop was only mildly scary, although my 11 year old son was a little apprehensive getting into the pod with the trap door which can be claustophobic. The Lazy River ride starts off well and then gets really boring and slow with a huge bottleneck of mostly boisterous young men which can get a little intimidating for women.We went to the park twice, but after experiencing the best rides 3 or 4 times, it got a little boring, especially having to queue. I would imagine in the peak season it would be extremely crowded.Compared to other waterparks and water rides around the world, the Wild Wadi was really no match."

Fab day out, but with the hotel package this is well worth it!Have kids aged 6 and 9 who went on all the thrill rides aside from jumeireah scarer!!'But of advice is to attend for the first two hours when the park opens via the hotel entrance go on all the big rides multiple times and then relax in the pool for a bit. We often then returned to our hotel pool for the afternoon or did other activities!!!Both kids enjoyed burj surj and my 6 year old went on tantrum alley for the first time and it was scary but ten minutes later all we heard was \" again please\". Do advise using the life jackets for smaller swimmers in the wave pool part even if u can swim well! Lifeguards are brilliant throughout relaxed yet helpful and keep everyone behaving!Recommend this watermark to everyone in Dubai. We have been every year and enjoy it more and more!"

If you have a younger kids it is free entry for up to 2 years 9 months so if you book online remember this. The lockers and food and drink are expensive as it would be as I am sure these shops pay huge rent to be in the park and running a water park in the desert cannot be cheap !

The rides are all mostly connected which inevitably is a bonus in the scorching heat. Having said that, I would not advise going during the midday sun because it's far too hot to walk on the stone floors particularly when queuing. I find that going during weekdays is much better as the queues are shorter and there is less of a bustle. During weekends, there are a lot more locals which although creates an atmosphere; increases queues and makes everything slightly rowdy. Like at all waterparks, there's a lot of queue jumping and the like but that's obviously going to happen. I wasn't particularly impressed with the wave pool, it's very warm like a bath. Not at all refreshing. The water also tends to be slightly grubbier than most and I would guess this is because of the greenery around the park. However, the rides are fantastic and perfect for everyone. Whether you enjoy thrillers or prefer to float along peacefully. There's even things for smaller children. Great experience."

There are tons of attractions, and whilst the park may not be as large or impressive as Atlantis waterpark in Dubai, it is great fun. There are a good number of slides (I think eight), and the Surf Rider is especially fun. We arrived early and since the park wasn't too crowded, the day went well and we got to ride everything in a five-hour visit. This park would be a solid choice, if not for one, fatal problem.The prices.They are absolutely extortionate, worse than almost all other tourist attractions in Dubai. Close to sixty pounds per person for admission, more than twice what one should expect to pay for a place like this, and even more than the far superior Atlantis Park. And that is without towels, food or any concessions. The towels are another problem, also costing close to ten pounds PER PERSON. Bring your own at all costs. Overall the day cost us the equivalent of almost 300 pounds, which despite the good quality of the park itself, was not worth these prices. I therefore recommend Atlantis over Wild Wadi, but this is still OK if the prices are not a problem for you."

On the inside they have reduced the seating area near the kids pool adjacent the tree area. The staff are mostly all unhappy, no smiling faces anymore, not like before when the atmosphere was very vibrant. After our visit, I was asked to complete a questionnaire and almost 2 months later Miss Janine Adams \"the entertainment specialist\" send me a feeble attempt of an apology. What a pathetic standard Wild Wadi is now. Don't waste your money here go to Atlantis instead."

The customer service is excellent, and the lifeguards assisting you to get through the tunnels/tubes are friendly and welcoming. The only disadvantage is the price - exorbitant, and once you pay the entrance fee - you have to additionally pay for lockers, food, and beverages. (Average ticket is between 220 - 285 AED)"

Buy your tickets in the UK if your from there as it's cheaper but do get them weeks in advance as taking of payment is one thing, processing and sending of the tickets can take considerably longer but in our opinion if you buy your excursions on various websites at least then all you do is presents print offs for vouchers at entrances then off you go. With Wild Wadi, when obtain wristbands don't forget to load up credit on there too, this will be for your lockers, if there's more than two of you then don't use small lockers as they are just that, too small, medium or large are best, loading if credit also allows you to buy your lunch there so you don't have to carry around money, at the end of the day when giving them back any remaining credit will be given back to you in cash. Whilst enjoying the water park most people tend to wear the aqua tops with good UV rating, thus us a must if you don't want to get burnt to a crisp, stay safe and have a blast, go pros and waterproof phones and cameras are a must and are allowed.

It's been a while since I'd been to a water park but this visit brought me back to my childhood in my teens...except everything is bigger, faster, and there are much more options. There's plenty to do whether you love the water or just like lying in the sun, for both children and adults. The slides were as exhilarating as the lazy river was, well, lazy. Speaking of the lazy river, there were a few jackasses who decided to pull my fiancee and I along with their tubes, but they were young and having fun and once I let them know to knock it off, they got the message. Overall, the park is very efficient (lines) and run professionally. The greeters and cashiers spell out everything for you so you know what to expect and where to go. The guides and chaperones kept the lines moving and the lazy river from getting bottle necked. I didn't buy anything except a locker for valuables, but I presume they were overpriced, even for Dubai, as one would expect for a park with a \"captive\" audience. The only issue we had was with my sunglasses and my fiancee's hair claws. The line for the Jumeirah Sceirah was long and there are some signs of what you cannot have while on the slide. I had $100 sunglasses and reluctantly and naively left them in a small box at the base of the stairs at the beginning of the line. Upon reaching the front of the line, the park personnel let my fiancee know she couldn't wear her plastic hair claws and held them in a small box for her. After we went down the slide, perhaps unsurprisingly my sunglasses were missing and we had to ascend the stairs (past everyone waiting in line) to get her hair claws. Seems as though signs could be more informative and a more secure place for these things at the beginning of the line would be more practical and expected (this is a desert environment and a water park after all, sunglasses are the norm). To Wild Wadi Park's credit though, I went to lost and found and they called me two days later saying they had secured my sunglasses. Overall, it was a good time, a bit pricey, but plenty of things to do."

Having been to other aqua parks in Europe that are much cheaper and bigger I would not rate wild wadi an an extraordinary one. They have basic slides.. Nothing special. A couple of them are adult slides but you can very quickly go through everything in a couple of hours. Staff and people working there are very nice though. And if you are a surfing beginner you could practice a bit there.My biggest disappointment was the price. It is very expensive knowing that you have to pay extra for everything/ towels.. Lockers..."

The water park is themed around a character named Juha from the Arabian folklore. It boasts of the biggest water slide outside of North America, but since then it has been replaced by two other water rides. It has cooled/cooled wave pool, two artificial surfing machines and multiple water slides. Its amazing place and a must visit."

However, even this can't justify the hefty admission price of AED 295 (\u00a360) which is excessive for the size and number of slides, etc.And surely there is no way to justify charging more for a portion of fries than the Gordon Ramsay restaurant at Atlantis charges for chips!However, the park is well laid out, clean and has great staff - especially the attentive lifeguards. ."

Slides, rides, wave machine and lazy rivers. A few places to eat and drink are scattered throughout the place. On arrival, you pay for lockers and charge your wristband with money. This saves having to take your wallet or purse around with you. It's an energetic day so you'll probably be tired afterwards but you can always rest on the many loungers about. People unfortunately stick a towel on them and then disappear for hours so this is a little frustrating. If you don't have a waterproof camera there are lots of staff with cameras around the main rides and pools who will take your photos and you can buy them at the end of the day. They'll scan your wrist band or give you a tag. These can be quite expensive especially if your looking to buy a few. A good tip is to buy a decent waterproof camera before you get there. This will also come in handy in the hotel pool!"

Previously the complementary pass was obtained at concierge at the hotel and a voucher given allowed swift and direct access to the park. This year the process has changed and you now have to queue at general admissions show your key and provide your room and details, this can take a bit of time. The park always provides a great fun day out will all rides open other than the larger flow rider which was under refurbishment. The lazy river with off shoots to rides via water travelators means no walking and climbing stairs in temperatures of 40 degrees plus.

Even with an entertainer voucher, the price for Two Adults and one child was nearly \u00a3100. Entrance fee is dependant on height and not age, so here's to hoping the kids are late bloomers. It is family friendly, there are lifeguards and staff everywhere with constant checks going on throughout the park. The Scierah remains the only ride that adults will get much excitement out of, however the other rides are enjoyable enough. We had a 8 year old with us and he absolutely adored every second. Especially when the wave machine is turned on in the paddling pool. It's nice enough but rides are limited and if you have older kids or are going as adults, venture over to AquaVenture as there's is much more to do there. In terms of value for money, you don't get much bang for your buck as it gets boring very quickly and you pay through the nose for everything. "

If you're taking kids, don't worry there are lifeguards throughout and the best bit is you don't have to walk up stairs as there is a blaster ride that shoots you up and down flumes. If you're staying in the Jumierah Beach Hotel, Burj Al Arab or that other huge hotel you get unlimited free entry which is always awesome! If not, WILD WADI is convenient from both the Palm and downtown Dubai. Top Notch!"

We went to the water park twice a day for our entire 9 day stay, normally first thing in the morning and then in the evening. We were visiting during Ramadan and it was very quiet, no queues for any any rides. I worked up the courage (as a 40 year old mum!) to go down the Jumeriah Sceriah and it was so much fun! I went down it about 20 times, it's so exhilarating. The ground was a bit hot in July but the park is very compact so you never had to walk too far too the next ride. We have been to Aquadventure at the Atlantis and I would say for older kids it is marginally better but not by much. Wild wadi could just do with a couple more thrilling rides and it would go into the lead. It was very safe to leave your belongings on a deck chair and they were never interfered with, if you are staying in JBH you get complementary towels in the water park and can charge all food and drink to your room."

Doesn't seem to work now though. Rides are great - haven't changed in 16 years, but I'm still a kid at heart. Best bit?

Usually, if you are the hotel guest, or Jumeirah Beach hotel guest, you will have free pass to the water park. There are various rides, suitable for different types of visitors. Some rides are for single, some are for couples, and they are both fun. lazy river is good for those who just like to lie in the water. It is not that big, so you do not need to spend lots of time on walking between the rides. Restaurant is in the middle of the park. Changing/Locker rooms are very clean.

This was one of the best rides in the Park so not great that it could only take single riders. The staff are very friendly and it was very easy to get a sun lounger. If you go in the height of summer I recommend you purchase a pair of Pumps that are sold at the park as the floor can get very hot and burn your feet.

The park is extremely hygienic. Lots of snacks available inside, though I must mention that everything is exorbitantly priced. Very clean and well maintained Locker rooms and washrooms.... Go on a weekday - the crowd is less and there's a more relaxed feel. Make sure to take along all necessary swimming apparatus - they have multiple shops inside filled to the brim with swimming costumes et all....but again it's exorbitantly priced.Another point to remember - even though we went on a blisteringly hot day, since we were in the water most of the time we did'nt feel the heat. But if you plan on sitting on the side while the kids frolic...then you are in trouble.....might be better to just soak in the water to stay cool.Our 11 yr olds had a blast as most rides were ideal for their age and height....nothing seemed extremely scary or impossible except maybe the surfing rides...All in all an exhausting but exhilarating day!Totally worth it."

Probably fair to say that our 7 year old got more out of the day than our 4 year old but that was to be expected. We visited in February half term, on a week day.

The food however is the only downside, overpriced and bland."

Great wading and kid friendly areas for the littlest ones and an excellent body surfing and more adventurous rides for teens. Best to get there at 10am and find a spot to set up camp. It's safe so you can let the kids explore independently and let your teens go off by themselves. About 3 hours of water fun will exhaust them enough. Lots of food options so get some lunch and leave by 2pm when the crowds start to arrive. Get a locker and stow away your valuables so that you don't lose your phone or wallet in the water.

Plenty of seating and loungers available at no extra cost.

At the end of our visit changed in well attended clean changing rooms with COOl shower, which was very welcome and quite unusual in Dubai. Most water tends to range from warm to scalding!!

All said and done, if entry is included with your room rate its worth a visit. On the upside, there was no lines when we visited but I think this would be very different on weekends and holidays."

Facilities are really clean and well maintained . Towels are given part of the visit so all you need is swimming costume. You can get locker for your valuable at 40 Edh . You get wrist band at entrance . No food allied unless baby food. Prayers room and showers available and clean. No need to take shampoos all available. Food a bit expensive compared to the quality. Icecream available too with pop corn and other food. Very good fun area for children, surfing for teens and adults . Pretty nice smooth rides too all around and high slides but age restriction applicable . You get food view of borj al Arab . Staff very helpful and if your hotel gives you access card to beach you will love it , amazing clean and a must see. Make sure you ask your concierge at the hotel for pass, otherwise you will not get access. This is good sight with or without children , if solo 3 hours will do if with the children you need all day.

The gentlemen at the store were very helpful. The park has been maintained well and was very clean. There were members of staff present at all times. The only faults I can mention is that the food variety lacks somewhat. There were only the basic burgers, wraps and pizza to be found. The wraps were great but there is a definitely need for healthier options I believe. Secondly, the memorabilia is truly expensive. It's a great concept to receive bands every time a photo is taken, but it is extremely expensive to purchase these. Other than that, I will love to return again!"

Purchased the meal and towel deal for 350 dirhams which in hindsight was extortionate. Never been before but in comparison to aquaventure at Atlantis it was poor. The sunbeds are placed in random locations and the site is relatively small so we struggled to find two free beds. We went on the large tube ride first ( the one on the left is better) queues were 15+ minutes, but it was shaded and windy. Then went off to find other rides to go on and we found 3 (yes 3!!) more rides. Granted they are water coasters that lead into other coasters or slides or the one where the floor drops (didn't go on it after a previous bad experience) but the water coasters were poor. Massive queues (up to 40 minutes) and the double ring got stuck up the hill (and we aren't even overweight in the slightest) the ones at Atlantis are far better. The one thing it has that Atlantis doesn't? A wave pool, which we went to go in and the lifeguards started moving people out with no explanation just whistles. Spent most of the day sunbathing which was a massive waste of money. Food included was like kfc but ok. At least we got a genuine magnum which was probably the highlight of the day (along with view of the burj) Would never return and waste money here when Atlantis is far superior"

Getting into the park it was unorganised, limited rides when we finally got in too - the water roller coaster isn't the best either, needs a bit more power to make it exciting I think? Jumeirah Sheriah was very good, but even for that I had a 30 minute queue (on a windy day, not so warm that high up waiting round - that's not a moan at the park either!)We got the food package which was decent, it's expensive but does anyone expect otherwise?I'm glad I've done Wild Wadi but I doubt I'll return in the future unless they renovate."

Family of four and we spent 200 dirham on food and drink, even then we only bought 2 kids meals! There are no towels to buy/rent so you have to take your own - it is so warm that you don't really need them anyway. Not been to Atlantis but I'd say there are 3 main rides with any 'fear' factor here for anyone above the age of 10. The rest are relatively kid friendly and tame. There are swim vests to use where required so no need to worry about taking your own arm bands etc.Definitely worth getting the entertainer app for this attraction alone. Saved us 550 dirham here (2 tickets free). Photos are approx 80 dirham each, or you can get all your photos of the day on a CD for 200 dirham. Taxis readily available at the end of the day (at 6pm)."

The bottom literally drops out from underneath you. It was terrifyingly fantastic. The open pool area was a bit dry as the waves were not particularly big but I think that was because of all the little ones and non swimmers.The food was pricey but it generally is in such attractions. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wanted to have an active day in a safe enclosed area. The staff were helpful and genuinely nice. I will visit it again when I come back to Dubai."

Kids of all ages seem to love the wave pool, but do make sure the little ones put on a life vest as the waves can get rather strong.I\u2019m really scared of heights, so the Jumeira Sceirah was terrifying to get in, but once it starts it\u2019s not too bad and it\u2019s over in 8 seconds. The Burj Surj is fun but also leaves me feeling like I\u2019m going to fall out onto the streets of Jumeira. The kids love the feeling of being flushed down the toilet like a bug; I love the view of the Burj Al Arab from the top \u2013 before you get on the ride. Master Blasters is fun for the whole family but the little ones shouldn\u2019t go alone if they don\u2019t weigh enough to hold down the raft.All in all, it\u2019s a great water park with just a few downsides. The shortcomings are that it\u2019s crowded and expensive, so try to get your hands on an Entertainer coupon. There isn\u2019t much to eat if you aren\u2019t into junk food, and some of the relaxing attractions (such as the feet eating fish) cost extra after you\u2019ve already paid a boatload to enter the park. The parking garage is super tight and often full. But apart from that, if you take plenty of cash and lather up the sun screen you\u2019re likely to have a great day."

Another benefit was free towels and free shuttle bus but we only have to pay AED 40 for the small locker. Great experience with loads of choices available. Best time to go is in the morning otherwise you will face long queues. Also buy a water proof case for your phone or get a small water proof camera.Overall great."

We arrived at 10am opening and the park was very quiet so always a good tip to avoid queuing! Loads of great rides and the park is set out much better with plenty of shaded/covered areas. The 'lazy' river is also connected to several slides so you never have a reason to leave the water unless tackling one of the bigger attractions. The wave pool is also a good addition and the park is very much on a par with ones I've been to in Florida previously. Pricey, but all of these things are."

The best part of ladies night is that the lines for the rides are shorter. However I could tell that there were new staff being trained on the night we went because they would have to shut down the slides due to the lifeguard not pushing the guest hard enough for them to get pass the master blasters. This made me lose my friends on the slides. I still do prefer Wild Wadi during the day though!

Don't bother, it isn't noisy here. Moreover kids energize you more than the sun and silence. I don't rate it 5 because the price is a bit high for only 15 kind of rides. You may find other parks offering more of them for the same price."

I am not sure if the bundle of activities are worthy enough for the money paid. i have been to Sun-way Lagoon; the water park in Malaysia before, and it was less costly while Wild wadi rather has less activities comparatively, and some of Wild wadi activities are in similar form. you also have to pay AED 50-70 for lockers .

My personal favorite is the inner-tube ride that has portions of the ride that go uphill, yes uphill. The food is a little pricey for the quality but what amusement park isn't?

Kids (8 & 10) were on the go for 4.5 hours and loved everything about Wild Wadi. Some rides were a bit scary for the little one but she had a go on everything except the Jumeriah Sceirah and loved the experience. The big guy did it all and had a ball. From an adult perspective it's heinously expensive but the wallet pain can be lessened by using 2 for 1 vouchers (we had the entertainer app which was worth the spend given we used it for the aquarium and some restaurants as well). Food is uninspired fast food fare but you are hardly going to expect much more at a place like this. Overall if you want you kids to think you are the best parents ever take them to Wild Wadi. And go early because there was no waiting time at the rides. It seemed to get busier from about 2pm and was quite busy at 5 when we left. The forecast was 39c on the day we went but it really didn't feel that hot because there's shade and water everywhere."

Went to search for public beach but found a a quite beach area whic wasnt in use by the public much.Food: Expensive do condier around 500 dinar to spend on food only if you are with familyDont forget to buy your waterproof phone cover, or u can get it from the park shops (just bit expensive to buy in the park)Pictures: Look for camera guys around you everywhere you play an activity and ask them to take your pictures so that you can buy them in the end. Just very very expensive pictures to buy so better to take nice pictures on your good quality of camera/phone.Locakers: You can buy lockers (large and small ones) on arrival. You get to buy a hand wrist band with some credit on it to spend in the park. This is the way to spend money on lockers, food, accesories, swimming clothes (yes u can buy some basic clothes in park shops). Lockers will cost you around 50dinar for large I guess.

Be careful that ones your in this is just the beginning of the assault on your wallet.You know that you pay a little bit more for food inside one of this parks than on the street, Not that this is acceptable but they can get away with this so they do!What really ticks me off is that you pay minimum 40 Dhs for a locker (Unless you take the option bring your cloths and valuable to the pool and leave them exposed.Why this not included? 40 Dhs for a towel (No you can not take it home) (This will scare you with entr\u00e9e fees) So they can get your wallet empty though the backdoor ones your in! 25 Dhs for a snow cone really? Be ready to add al least 100 to 150 Dhs per person extra on top of your entrance fee.Such a shame as they are the ones losing out park was as good as empty could walk in every attraction directly. Would love to come more than twice a year but feel shafted every time I go! Place looks tired would choose other venue in UAE as there are plenty. Just would be simple close to home day out if it would not cost close to 2000 Dhs for a family. Also hard pressed to spend a whole full day there! What reflects already in the next question recommended length of visit 1-3 hours so you spend max 3-4 hours there and that for 2000 Dhs that's simply overpaid."

Luckily it wasn't a busy period so we were able to go on all the rides within 2 hours, after that we were left with nothing to do. There were about 6-7 slides and rides suitable for our age of 27, and even the family part for kids didn't look too appealing. There are however nice areas to relax in and plenty of sunbeds to laze around in. Your not allowed to take you own food in and you are suggested to buy a locker the cheapest (small) being \u00a37.50.

We obivously had expectations due to the reviews we had read online and from people that have gone before. Honestly, the waterpark was very unorganised, it was unsystematically arranged. Not all the rides exciting just a few, but I guess it doesn't quite matter as long as you've got good company. The lifeguards and staff were really helpful whenever assisstance was needed. Overall the experience was expensive and just an average enjoyment."

My favourite part is the slides that get you, not down, but up through the use of jets that push your inflatable. It has a decent choice of thrilling slides, surf jet slides and a big wave pool. If you ask me which is better, Atlantis or Wild Wadi, I'll say its one has its own merits and you should visit both. As we are not interested on dolphin encounters that Atlantis offers, I think Wild Wadi is better fun. One thing that needs improvement is the changing rooms, the queues are long and crowded at the end of the day; this needs urgent improvement to go along with the quality of the rest of the park."

Staff/security were abrupt and unhelpful at the front gate.We ended up walking half a mile along the Jumeirah Road to flag a taxi down, along with many others. With two young kids, that's not a pleasant experience.The location next to Burj Al Arab, whilst spectacular, makes the entrance area a total roadblock. There's lots of shade and cooling fans/water sprays along the footpaths, but in the cooler months of December/January, that's not necessarily a good thing.The rides were good, but not a patch on Aquaventure and not worth the money, in my opinion. We felt we were constantly being encouraged to spend more, especially for photos."

If you haven't been to Wild Wadi for a few years your in for a big surprise. They have added more rides which are superb. Been to a lot of water parks in my life and this one by far has the scariest ride. Dont know who was the most scared, me, my son or my 5 year old grandson. I was not expecting such a scary ride when we all got in the rubber ring. Try them all, you will soon find it, oh, and wear a brown cossie.... WW is smaller than Adventure Park by Atlantis but nowhere near as busy which is fine for me and far more photogenic with the Burj in the background. Great day out."

The last time I visited Wild Wadi was about 15 years ago, and in certain respects it is very much the same, but in others it has moved on with the times. As the last time, we got in for free because we were staying at a Jumeirah hotel (who own Wild Wadi), and thus we felt justified in only staying a couple of hours. Kids of all ages will love it, as there are activities for all ages, be it gently floating round one of the \"rivers\", hurtling up and down slides, or trying your hand at surfing on a standing wave. The first thing I noticed changed was the number of people there - it can be very crowded, and there are queues for most rides, though not as long (distance or time) as in places like Disneyworld. Another change was the \"Jumeirah Scarer\" a long drop slide which formerly you just climbed to the top of the tower, and got on the slide when the bottom was clear. Now there is an elaborate system where you are sealed into a pod and after a countdown the floor drops out from under your feet to launch you. This certainly adds to the sense of trepidation. All in all a great day out to get you out of the Dubai heat."

Anyway, It is still a great water park. what I like about it is you don't queue much and sometimes you queue while you are inside the water. It is a bit expensive, so it is better to go there for a whole day, not just for few hours. Also, Since the lockers are not free, it is better to avoid bringing many valuable things. It has a free parking, so you can leave some of your stuff in your car. There is no access to the beach, but there is a pool which makes waves, and another pool for surfing."

Also, it has so many different slides and a huge swimming pool with artificial waves. It's very creative! There are also a few fast food restaurant with really good food. It's also very big and has a lot of space which is amazing for children. It's also very clean and safe! It's for all ages and it was much better than I expected. There's just one problem, there isn't a lot of chairs available to sit so I would recommend you come quite early because it gets full very quickly especially on weekends. A good amount of time to stay there would be a full afternoon. Otherwise, it's a magnificent waterpark."

We had an Entertainer voucher for buy one get one free to use at Wild Wadi, so we decided to take advantage of the offer.We drove and parked in the free underground car park next to the water park. At the time there plenty of spaces but we did arrive at 10:30am.The queues were small and we literally had 2 or 3 people in front of us. We paid one entrance fee and gave the Entertainer code which was accepted. We then paid for a single medium locker, 2 towels and pre loaded 150 Dhms onto a wrist band for food and beverages in the park. After changing and locking away our belongings and just needing our towels we headed to find a couple of chairs/sun beds. There were so many available in every location, but some were sheltered and some were in the direct sun. We left our towels on 2 sun chairs and headed to the rides. You have to collect the towels using your wrist band from the 'Souk' in the park.The first ride was the White Water Wadi. You could use single or double rings, but on a single ring there was more chance of spinning around whilst travelling. This ride climbs and jets of water shoot you up the tubes making you twist and turn. There are always different routes to take and it's so much fun. It's mainly exposed but there is a tunnel too! This connects to 11 slides. Flood River Flyer is a similar ride but connects you to 6 different slides. All of these are so much fun for adults and children and extremely safe. We tried both Tantrum Alley and Burj Surj. Amazing slides, great with 2 or more people on these rides. Just watch out if you are riding backwards down the slide, you are in for an experience and hold on tight! I tried Jumeriah Sceirah! This is a speed slide! Wow it's high and you seriously move at some speed, but it's all over within 10 seconds. It's incredible and it all starts when you are briefly locked in a cylinder standing upright and then there's a 3 second countdown. Next thing you see is the floor drop beneath you and you are moving at a serious speed through a tube with water. It's 32 metres high and you travel 120 metres at approx 80kph!Riptide Flowrider was another great ride. It's all about balance and doing as the instructors tell you. It's brilliant fun and well worth giving it a go.We spent from 10:30am - 4pm in the park. The queues were great and we waited a maximum of 5 minutes for some rides, but the staff keep the rides flowing. We ate in the park at Ali's BBQ area. This is a counter service area with sheltered seating. We ordered a chicken kebab, large drink and this we actually shared as there was plenty. It came with a large pot of hummus and 2 pitta breads with additional dips and fries. This cost approx 75 Dhms. They give you an order number then when your food is ready the staff deliver it to you when seated in the BBQ area.When you finish, you take your wrist bands back to the souk and any remaining money to handed back to you. When you leave the park there are towel bins to place used towels in and you hand back your wrist bands at the exit gates. Some people had mobiles on them, if you need your phone or camera take them with you at the time of changing. The park also sell a waterproof phone case for you to use on the rides and this costs 120 Dhms and they can be purchased in the souk.Would I recommend the park? Yes. Would I return? Definitely. Is it worth the cost? Definitely. Is it safe? Yes.An overall FANTASTIC day! "

Wildwadi water isnt just about rides but it is one of the best spot to take pictures with majestic Burj ul Arab in the background, also you can choose the beach or the city while you are on few rides ofcourse before you get on the ride until and unless you have GOPRO or Water-resistant phone case. Its really a great place to hang around with friends, i would discourage solo visitors for the very reason because you need a minimum on few rides or be on others mercy to take you with them not a great sight when its your turn but you have no partner so make sure you enjoy in groups.For the scenery and sight i dont mind the price. Enjoy your day at the water park and you have a water resistant suncream to protect your from sun burn. Directions to the park are very simple if you have a metro line near you and head to Mall of the emirates, get a cab and reach wald wadi.If you are budget catch a bus and reach this park.Other options include cab or own ride.Happy splashing..."

            "review": "Good but yas waterworld easier and more worthwhile . Returned to wild wadi after 10 yearsAlthough the place is clean and well maintained In my little opinion I feel yas waterworld has more rides, different types of rides, and is easier to spend the day there due to this Main frustration: You pay for the entrance fee and receive a bandYou then pay extra monies which are loaded into a wrist band for foodHOWEVeR this money is NOT refundable so if you don't use t all you lose it- but it's kind of difficult to predict who will be eating what as children have varying appetites ...Once inside the park there are 3 food places where all the menus offer burgers, fried chicken, pizza or Other options.However, yu can only get burgers from place 1, fried chicken from place 2 and pizza from place 3.So if everyone in the group wants something different you all have to queue up at the place where they sell that.Other options such as tandoori chicken in naan or bbq chicken is advertised at all the places. But you can't pay for that with your wrist band. The tills for those options only accept cash. So if you want that, you need to go back and get cash and then pay for that seperately to the other food you've ordered. What management need to do is just put pizza menu in 1 place and burgers menu in 1 place instead of offering menus that don't sell the item in that venue because it's Very confusing and time consuming to get this exlained to you once you're there. I have medium intelligence and it took me a while. It is entirely possible this food conundrum was just a problem for me. Other points all bags must be checked for outside food - okay that's fine it's a rule and we respect that and they are really good at letting baby food in and respectfully searching bags but if a large family have come in looking forward to a day out and have bought their own food as its cheaper what happens to the food? Gets wasted and the family have to pay more just to eat in - seems slightly unreasonable and unfair to me. The rides are good - Jumeira sceirah is really for daredevils.Employees genuinely enjoy their job and provide a fun atmosphere.Very helpful with children.Most rides are lazy river types.Kids play area looked really fun and 9 year old enjoyed that immensely .Waves machine also excellent.Changing area very clean, showers also well looked after, prayer area immaculate.

There are approx 6 life guards who look after this pool so you feel ok if your child runs off in excitement and you lose sight of him for a few seconds, Our 4 year old loved it he slept very well that night. We had free entry as we were staying at a jurmeria group hotel we also had meal vouchers we could use at the park for food we had God from the chicken place situated by the kids water play area the food was as good as a kfc, but would have cost over \u00a365 if we didn't have the meal vouchers.

The water park is a number of years old now (we have been coming for over 8 years) and it still runs efficiently. There are numerous life guards and the tube rides are all great fun.For the young kids (under 1.1m) there is a water park area with mini slides (about 5 in total) just behind the wave pool, which they can also go in with life jackets. The lazy river is also fun for young ones that can sit in the tubes, or for the really small kids/babies, they have special blue tubes which dont have a hole in the middle so the younger kids can be pushed around by their parents.If you're looking for thrills and spills, hands down Atlantis' Waterpark beats Wild Wadi, but for families with younger children, Wild Wadi is better suited. There were lots of older kids/adults without kids here too having fun.The food options here are limited if you are looking for Gluten Free or vegetarian options. Meat eaters are catered for though."

We wanted a place where we could all find something to enjoy and they had previously visited the park at the Atlantis but said they found it catering more for older kids and adults. We arrived (on a friday) pretty early and stayed right through until the park closed (at 7pm) - we were never board and everyone enjoyed their day there. I felt there was a good variety of rides with varying 'thrill' levels, perhaps we were lucky but we also didn't have to queue much for anything (15 minutes max.). The kids really enjoyed it too. Guess my main thing would be that like pretty much all other water/theme parks the food provided there is not great value (captive audience) and tends to only be fast-food, but hey. We also ended up having a really nice photo taken of all of us by one of the photogrpahers that are 'floating' around the place (unintended bad pun). Something else I quite liked was the fact that it felt safe enough to leave bags and things on sun-beds while you swam or went on slides. There are also discounts vouchers available and a massive discount for Dubai residents, which all help make it a much better value day out."

We didn't have to pay as we were staying at a Jumeirah hotel, though if you are paying I did think entry was expensive. The place is extremely well organised and the staff are first class. There is something for everyone. Many of the rides have a minimum height requirement of 1.1 and to be honest, like any theme park, if you have very young children, I would probably wait until they are older as there is too much they cannot do. My two youngest spent all their time in the lagoon area which is perfect as very safe, but still exciting as they have a wave machine that is switched on at regular intervals. There are also a set of kids flumes which mine loved. Very very safe as there are lifeguards at the top and bottom of each slide. My 5 year old has always refused to go on any water slide - he is simply too scared, until Wild Wadi. An amazing lifeguard called Lydia saw he was frightened and routed to the spot and while I have no idea how she managed it, she took him under her wing (while still paying full attention to everyone else), and within 15minutes he was going on every slide (reporting back to her each time with his progress!). She was brilliant and I am beyond grateful to her for what she did. Lots of good quality places to eat and deckchairs in both the shade and sun. And you can put cash onto your locker key when you arrive so that essentially the place operates a cashless system. If you have money left at the end of the day, you simply get it credited back to you as cash. You need to pay for lockers and towels. If you have a family you will need a medium locker or larger. It is a really fun day out (and we were there all day). Definitely recommended for water fans generally and children of probably 7+."

            "review": "A decent day out - a compact water park but with some pretty good rides. Watch out for the add-on costs!. At 275dhs each (over \u00a350) this is not a cheap attraction, but we used an Entertainer voucher and got one admission free, so that made it better value. Easy to get to by car, and with a free car park on site. The bad bits: We arrived just after opening at 10am, and even then there were long queues to get in (45 mins) so we were lucky it was a cooler day, or that would have been VERY uncomfortable. Food and drink are fairly pricey inside the park, and your bags are searched on entry, (any food and drinks are confiscated), but you can bring in 1ltr of water per person, so I'd advise doing this. Watch out for the locker scam! Lockers have to be paid for, and the smallest, at 40dhs is TINY - hardly big enough for our 2 handbags and a spare towel. A large locker will cost you 70dhs - about \u00a314 - and is still not that big - a family of four may still need 2. Definitely BRING YOUR OWN TOWELS! Towel rental is 40dhs each, and it all adds up. The good bits: On the good side, the park is very attractive, with great views from the taller rides, and with plenty of sitting areas and loungers where you can leave your towels etc. There are free life vests for kids and less confident swimmers so everyone can enjoy the attractions.Although there aren't many rides, those that are there are are pretty good. Forget the Lazy River unless you just want to use it to get used to the water - it's a bit dull and incredibly slow-flowing and when you go under the waterfall, it traps you there! The wave pool is great, but got very crowded even on the quiet weekday when we visited, and I can imagine it's not so pleasant at busier times. Tantrum Alley is fantastic - really exciting and one where you're definitely hanging on for dear life! Burj Surj is great too, but a little bit more gentle. The maximum wait time was 30 minutes for both, so no problem getting a few repeat rides! The info board for Tantrum Alley said parts of the ride would be enclosed and in darkness, but it wasn't in darkness at all.  The Master Blaster, where jets of water carry you uphill in your inflatable ring, is another must-do, and again the queue was never too long - max 30 mins at the busiest time of day. This slide has a stage called Tunnel of Doom, which is in complete darkness, but there's an alternative route for anyone who might not like this - watch out though, because the attendants automatically send you down the Tunnel of Doom if you don't say anything! The end part of this ride is pretty dull - just a very slow, congested 'lazy river' part. I'd advise hopping out at the first set of steps. There are 2 surfing/body boarding attractions, both with quite long queues, but worth the wait just to experience something like this. Be prepared for the entire queue to enjoy all your falls and mistakes though! :) The only annoyance was a few idiots with their own boards, showing off, splashing any females in the queue and hogging the ride for far too long. The instructors need to be stricter with these guys.All in all, good fun, and plenty to keep us busy for the whole day despite the small scale of the park. Without complimentary hotel admission or a discount voucher, it could be a bit costly, but a still worth a visit, especially on a weekday to avoid the crowds."

Seemed to be quite a lot of seating-we arrived at opening time but was very busy by the time we left at 1pm.I got separated from my son on the lazy river. Luckily he had the sense to get out and ask for help. It took 3 different members of staff before he found someone who actually helped him. At the same time I asked two lifeguards neither who spoke English and the third one told me \"he would turn up soon\". I didn't feel that their procedure for lost children was very effective."

There is something for everyone and age. even if you do not like water its fun just being there, all of the rides are well supervised and there are plenty of life guards on hand so children are save at all times. If you are staying at the Jumeirah Beach hotel you can gain access to the park 1 hour before the public, and this means you miss the crowds and have a better chance of getting you best seats for the day, there are plenty of shops selling food gifts and clothing, there are always lots of life vest for you to use for children and adults.

We were fortunate to have free passes included in with our hotel package, otherwise it is an expensive day out for a full family, but the park itself is a good size - upon arrival it took us time to find some free sun loungers but keep going through the park and there are places towards the back with plenty available both in the sun and the shade so don't give up too soon! There are quite a few rides where you get in inflatables which are good fun - can ride the creek or take on the white water Rapids - for the more adventurous there is the Jumeirah Scream where you stand upright in a pod and countdown 3-2-1 before you're released down the shoot - over quickly but good fun! All in all a good way to spend a few hours on a hot day. Also throughout the park you get great views of the Burj Al Arab and the beach which looks fantastic."

This place is good fun with a wide clientele ranging from locals to tourists and local expatriates.The rides are fun and would certainly recommend the Tantrum Alley and Burj Surj. The Jumeirah Scerah is good for those with an adventurous frame of mind.The trick is to arrive just after opening at 10.00 a.m. in order to have minimal queues at the rides. Leave it any later and the number of people coming in increases, especially after lunch. Then the queues get longer, sometimes to as much as 30 minutes for each ride.The food available is decent and a bit pricey. Certainly not 5 star, but does the job to stave off the hunger pangs."

Since I was staying at Jumeirah Emirate Towers I had a free access to Wild Wadi. If you are staying at any of Jumeirah Group hotels you can show them your room keycard lock and room number to get into the park. If you want locker you should pay 40 dirhams for small locker. This is not the biggest water park in the world! however you can have a great time for 2-3 hours. I suggest you to be there as early as 10AM(opening time), because as time goes by it will be more crowded.You can find good rides at the park. Jumeirah Sceriah is really fun and scary, you must cross your arms and legs as the doors of the capsules close, and then ready for free fall.I general it is a nice medium-size water park, with good atmosphere, nice view of Burj al Arab, and nice stuff. It is a really good place for 2 to 3 hours stay."

We queued to get in, queued to change ( a sign insisted you had to change in a cubicle, but there were few of them in the women's changing room). We walked round for 20 minutes trying to find a single lounger that wasn't already reserved with a towel. Found one eventually so the non-swimmer in our group could sit down (At the end of the day it seemed lots of \"reserved\" loungers had just been abandoned with hire towels left on them - if I went again, I'd just chance it and take a lounger which had just a hire towel on it, when I needed it). We queued for half an hour to go on the Wadi blaster. The ride was great fun and lasted ages, so the queue seemed more worthwhile. Queued again to go on surfing ride, but we were queue-jumped and it was all talking ages, so we abandoned that one. This was only a Tuesday, so goodness only knows what it's like on a Friday or Saturday. Then we started to get the hang of it & notice that some great rides had short queues, and it all improved. We had a great time. The lifeguards who help you on the rides are generally really friendly and great with the kids. We stayed until it closed at 7pm and the views from rides were great, lights atmospheric, and queues much reduced in late afternoon. The water park was well done, clean, well-maintained, brilliantly staffed, and nicely planted. Changing rooms were poor in comparison.Tips:1. Use the Entertainer Dubai 2016 scheme for BOGOF entry for people over 1.1m tall. The cheaper Entertainer Kids voucher is only for smaller kids. 2. Take your own drinks! 3. Stay late to enjoy atmospheric lighting and smaller queues. 4. Don't bank on buying extra swimwear there - the prices are scarey. 5. It was difficult to gauge how scarey each ride was from the signs, so ask lifeguards for advice."

Odly the highly priced food and beverages were somehow chaotic. We had to wait 30mins for one pizza having paid for it. Thirty minutes of hanging around, being reassured it was coming. Other facilities had run out of everything except \"strawberry ice cream.\"The overall experience was thus of a small, but long queuing, old fashioned and expensive water park.

We had to run through the whole park to find some available chairs. The kids water play was really cold, but most shockingly were so rude and even screaming staff. Wild Wadi is the only Water park, where you are not allowed to slide with your child, which makes it impossible to use any slide for kids below three years of age. There is only one water pool available. The floating river was so cold, that we existed after only five minutes, because the kids were shivering. For an entry price of AED 275 I would expect much more than that, the most thing bothering was the rude staff."

All rides are poorly sign posted, but once you find them they're very good. My particular favourites were the tantrum alley and burj surj, both fast multi person adrenaline rides which go round many twists and turns. Another favoirite was the wadi master blaster. Single or double ring ride, which takes you on rapid accelarstion through tubes and dark tunnels. Very good"

Towels are provided so you just need to take yourself! You get a little red band which is a locker key and can be loaded with cash to spend on food and drinks whilst you are there. Ladies go in a swimming costume that holds everything in... The power of the water flumes dislodges your attire so best to play safe. I'd also recommend a uv shirt. It's a really safe and clean environment. If you want to swim in the big wave pool don't be embarrassed to put on a life jacket. I can swim but used one to bob about in the big waves which was great fun. Go early on in the morning when it's a bit quieter. You can walk about in bare feet so suggest you put flip flops in your locker - some people abandon them by the 'ride' but you then have to walk back for your flip flops which seems crazy. In hot months then Aqua shoes would be a good idea as the floor gets hot."

While there are several water parks in UAE, wild wadi is simply the best..not too big and not too small..attention to details and very very safe..I take my kids in the summer all the time, they love it..the food is not bad, the prices are reasonable..been to the other ones in UAE, I will rank Yas island water park number 2 after this one...you will enjoy your time and excellent customer service"

Love this waterpark, think they have really thought it through, from the wrist bands so you don't have to carry any cash/cards, the paths being mainly shaded so you don't burn your feet! Best way to get a ticket I think is via their website we paid 276aed as a couple for tickets into the park and a meal each, which is way cheaper then just buying tickets into the park! It is standard fast food but its exactly what you would expect! would definitely return as its a good day out!"

It is a great place if you are a family with kids with a big gap difference, because everybody can play and have fun and the place is not huge so you don't spend the day looking for each other. The water slides are nice, though if you are a true thrill seeker you might be a bit disappointed. The major problem is the food. How can you only offer junk food options, when you do not allowed your customer to bring some food in the Park. Basically if you are not staying at the Jumeirah Hotel attached, you'll have to eat the disgusting, greasy, american typical Fast food. And it is honestly the worst quality of that type of food. I mean, junk food might be ok, once in a while ... but this. Yucky ! Not to mention that if you are a vegetarian, as I am, and as are millions of other people you will have to eat a pizza or some french fries. So if you don't mind spending around 1000 dirhams for only one afternoon for a 4 members family, go after lunch."

You can use it to rent a locker and to buy food. Make sure you put enough money on there to avoid having to go back to the entrance for more (refunds are to be done at the souvenir shop afterwards)"

We booked our entry tickets on the day through our hotel concierge and got a small discount off the cost. We arrived just after opening time and there were no queues to get in. We didn't take any food with us just drinking water. Your bags are searched by security on the way in. Once in the park you collect wrist bands which you add credit to enabling you to make purchases in the park instead of carrying cash around. They also lock and unlock your lockers. Any credit left over at the end of the day is paid back to you when you hand back the wrist bands. There is plenty to do with a good choice of slides and splash zones. There is also the lazy river for those who aren't keen on the more strenuous activities. We found there was plenty of sun chairs, umbrellas and loungers located around the park. Based on other reviews we had the pizzas for lunch and they were very good. The staff were very helpful and friendly and there appeared to be high ratio of lifeguards to guests. There was always a resident photographer around and for each photo they took you received a wristband so you could review them at a photo station and buy them if you wanted. For the day out after factoring in tickets, food, drinks, locker rental etc it cost us around 1200 AED. Overall we had a great day out and would recommend it."

At this time of year the queues for rides are very small, if indeed there are any queues at all! There are plenty of inflatable rings to use on the rides and the Lazy River is not totally clogged up with discarded inflatables so that you can't move. The other guests seemed very relaxed and the majority were from the Madinat Jumeriah hotels (you can tell by the wristband). In the summer there are lots of locals, in particular large groups of men who seem to thunder through the park regardless of the other visitors. If you are in Dubai, I would thoroughly recommend a visit!"

            "review": "Best water park in the U.A.E . It has taken us many years to finally visit this park and I can confidently say it is now our favourite water park in the U.A.E and here are the reasons:Kids who are taller than 1.1m can go to most all rides unlike the other parks around which require 1.2 (and above) and in this household it made a positive difference to our experience.The rides are fun for all ages. Unlike other parks you do not have to climb a huge flight of stairs carrying your own donut (inflatable device) to take part of the ride, the conveyor belt does the job for you. It actually felt as if the journey to the rides weren\u2019t as steep as in other parks visited and you can actually ride on the \u201cMaster Blaster\u201d all the way to the top to go to the Jumeirah Sceirah taking a short cut.The park is well maintained, clean and the only slippery area found was the wooden bridge and the rides aren\u2019t scattered around either.The staff was very friendly and professional from the supervisors to the cleaning smiling staff all over the park they all shown excellent customer services. (Food outlet excluded, see below)The location is not out of the way, easy to get to and ample free parking which is not far from the entrance either.Beautiful views throughout the park with the awesome Burj Al Arab right there with plenty of photos opportunities. There are photographers everywhere too ready to take million photos of you, just remember to check yours prior to giving your bracelet back.There is an area for younger kids, which was popular however lacked a sitting area for the parents to stay out of the way but still watch their youngsters.As most places, you aren\u2019t allowed to carry in food or drinks with you and unfortunately the weak point in the park is the food.The \u2018fast\u2019 food (burgers and chips) has taken 29 minutes which we waited standing by the window because they had run out of numbers. We were not alone, there were plenty of others there and when you are paying $16 dollars each of such meal it is not acceptable, especially if tastes bad too.There are however various restaurants with options and will definitely try something else next time. Remember to add credits to your bracelet at the entrance so you have the flexibility to buy food and drinks (remember, non-alcoholic only) without having to carry cash with you. And yes, they will refund any balance on your way out.Do not expect to be a cheap day out; you can easily spend double the amount of the entrance fee with extras inside, the shop is great. There are other options of parks if price is an issue, just shop around. They often run special offers for residents and had valentines special so keep an eye to grab a deal or stay in one of the Jumeirah hotels for free entry.The toilets were clean and manned by; again, professional staff and it could do with better signage for ease of finding it.There are lockers everywhere which you pay extra for as well as the option of renting or buying towels. Separate entrance for guests coming from the hotels and nice cabanas also available.There are separate areas for the smokers which is great for families.Keep in mind that depending on the time of the year the queues can be long, in December \u2013 February can get quite chilly when coming out of the water however there are fewer crowds.We will hopefully go back soon for more fun before it gets too busy in the warmer months. Hope you have fun too when visiting."

When you have more time and you want to go for a full day; I recommend you pay a little bit more and you go for the Atlantis waterpark. Wild wadi is fun and you've got like 5cool slides, but once you've done all of them a couple of times you get a bit bored! Don't get me wrong, the slides are nice so once again if it's only for a couple of hours it's definitely worth doing!"

I am not a fan of water slides to put it mildly but even I enjoyed the experience.At the entrance they offer a meal packages, definitely worth taking up, as there is no choice but Disney type of meals. If visiting with small children, don't bother bringing snacks or drinks - no outside food or drinks are allowed in the park. All will be taken away at security check at the entrance. At the time we visited in February only a few slides had a short wait. Plenty of floaties available, including those with seats specially designed for small children. Seating is at premium, but then again this isn't a place for sun worshippers!Small children have a choice of wave pool or a climbing frame with slides suitable for small children. No other rides are available for for children under 1.10 m high. The park is very clean and well staffed with life guards who take their job seriously.Would definitely recommend this park for both children and adults. "

There are plenty of places to eat, relax, sunbathe and play. The changing rooms have been upgraded to include waterfall showers and separate changing areas.The staff are always friendly and helpful and we have a great time every time.One thing that really sets wild wadi apart is its crowd control. You will never be queueing for hours for one ride like you do in Aquaventure.Love Wild Wadi and it deserves the number one place.Even as a tourist, it is worthwhile buying the Dubai Entertainer voucher book as it offers three buy one get one free tickets and with a group of four it pays for itself.Highly recommend."

I have a daring 15 year old and a brave 12 year old who love the thrills of the big rides and this park is perfect for them. I particularly like the roller coaster style rides but ladies-hold on to your bikini knickers!! The wave pool is great fun and life jackets are provided for non swimmers or lazy swimmers like myself that just want to 'bob' in the water. Fast food is expensive and the meal we had in the restaurant under the kids play park (with the bucket that tips) was dreadful. I saw people carrying pizza and that looked much nicer. They operate wristbands which you load money onto on arrival which means you can put your valuables in a locker and not worry about carrying money. Any left over money is reimbursed on departure."

I wish I knew this before I went in. The price is a bit steep but then again it is an experience if you are visiting Dubai. However, please note, when buying tickets at the booth, please don't buy the food coupon from there, just go in straight to the food stand and you can buy the food a bit cheaper yourself. I guess they charge extra for the wrist band they give you. Before you leave, don't forget to check the photo booth if you had any pictures taken, they cost only 100 Dirham for one picture which is not bad."

Highly recommend the 4 person tube as you slide up high on both sides of the ride before hurtling through darkness to end up in the pool.Food is basic and is on the high price side for what you get.A great day can be spent as family members spent many a time at the surf slide where you can pretend to surf.Overall, money well spent as you could manage all the rides and then keep on doing your favourite. Its safe for children and its a great way to loose teenagers as they tire themselves going after all the rides...Enjoy!"

The tickets were a bit expensive so if you do not want to pay full price get the Entertainer Voucher books, which give buy one get one free for Wild Wadi. There are not many rides but you have enough to have a great day. One down issue is the price of food inside and you have to bring your own towels if you do not want to pay around \u00a310 for one towel."

I liked Wild Wadi but if you are looking for the best water park go to Aqua Adventure at Atlantis which you will pay more for so it's a trade off. This park is one of Dubai's oldest and although it is in a great location, it's a bit land locked so everything is compressed. Fine if you don't like to walk so far and also free if you are staying in adjoining hotels. If you really like water parks then you need to try this one."

While there were only a few rides, all of them were extremely well done. Each one was enjoyable with the longest slide lasting for over 3 minutes!

We were there on 2 January 2016 and arrive at 9:50, 10 minutes before opening time. There were already about 30 people waiting to get in. Initially we did not have to really queue for rides but from around 12:30 it became quite busy and we had to wait 20 - 40 minutes for the popular rides. We left at about 14:00 and then it was quite busy although it never felt over crowded (apart from waiting long for rides). But overall a fantastic experience. Staff were very friendly and helpful. For those with deep pockets, you can rent one of the cabanas (only 6 available, at AED 2000 for the day). These are in a private area. Not really necessary if you are going early and leaving before it gets busy. There are other areas that are also quite private at no additional cost - look on the terraces. The areas next to the wave pool is quite busy.The views are spectacular!"

The place is not very huge (as i have heard of Aquaventure). The rides are very good if you travelling with a family and if you reach early you can avoid the rush and complete all the rides in 4-5 hours.Locker is charged separately, so we took a large locker in which we all adjusted our bags.Food is quite expensive inside compared to the rates outside.This place is located right in front of the main gate of Burj Al Arab."

Otherwise, the rides themselves are very typical of any other water park - nothing extra special. Normally that's an ok thing but for a place like Dubai where they pride themselves on bigger, grander, over-the-top, this came in on average. Would I visit again? Maybe. But not definitely. But that's because I'm not a huge water park person. What I did enjoy is the experience of the fish pond/pedicure pool where little teeny tiny fish eat away at the calluses on your feet. That was interesting and worth a try if you haven't experienced it before. But you could do that part without needing to enter nor pay for the entire park."

We just jumped on one of the golf buggies and got a free lift straight to the entrance gate, grabbed the wrist band and we were in. The park was open everyday and closed around 8pm. One evening a week they close a couple of hours early and re-open for ladies only. Jack and I would leave mum on the beach around 4pm and dash over for a couple of hours before getting back in time for dinner. This would give us time to go on each ride. Most rides consist of sitting in tubes/rings and either flying own the ride or being fired along by water jets. Some of the rings are tandem, but some are single. Jack was OK on the singles and he's 10 now. The tubes interconnect, so it's not definite that you will follow each other. One of you may end up going down a different tube and they don't all end at the same point, so you need to plan a meeting point in advance and make sure your children are happy to go alone.There's also a great lazy river which can be done in single or tandem tubes. There's a couple of water falls along the way, so you will get splashed. One of the water jet tube rides ends in the lazy river, which is a nice touch.There's also a wave machine where you can surf, but the queue is about 30 mins. Most rides have a 10 mins queue, although it gets busier at the weekend.We only ate here once and paid cash. We kept our things in a locker. It's mainly Burgers and Chips and there's one Pizza place. When it was Jack and I we didn't take anything with us and used their free towels to dry off. We left our flip flops in one of the many shoe racks at the bottom of the ride and collected then before we left to go.There's plenty of shade, but some queues are not covered and the sun is still very strong at 5pm, so we wore our sun vests. The sun cream will soon come off!There are plenty of sun loungers, but people don't seem to use them as there's too much fun to have.Wild Wadi was a great feature of our holiday - Jack wishes we had one next to our house."

There is so much to do you won't know where the time went. I arrived act 10.30 and stayed till closing around 7. Closing times vary at different times of the year to coinside with spiritual holidays. There is something for all ages whether you are a thrill seeker, then there are huge water slides that will take your breath away from the height and speed of the rides, seeking relaxation then using a tube and slowly drifting around all the rides is a must. There are the waves that are an experience if you can bear to be lifted off your feet and planted who knows where( make sure you can swim for this or stay close to the edge for safety). Or if not sure then walk around and decide. Food is quite expensive here as you can't bring your own you don't really have a choice but to buy a few items as you get hungry and thirsty being there all day.It can be a it expensive so check out prices online either before you go or look for deals at your hotel once you arrive.Overall I had a great day , we all did.

            "review": "Great Rides!. When you go to wild wadi, you have to do online booking, since there are huge lines for getting a ticket. But my family and I learned the hard way, we didn't book online and we had to wait in line for half and hour. When you are booking a ticket, take the package, where you can get free pictures and 200 dirhams in your green watch, and a locker to put your clothes in. Since you can get food with the 200 dirhams, and you can take loads of pictures for free! But that costs about 1,000 dirhams which is really expensive. So you can either get that or just the package where you can enter and you won't get free pictures of 200 dirhams extra or a locker. I would recommend the Jumeriah Scream for the first ride you do, since it is the scariest ride in the whole park and you can get done with it. Then you should probably do the Burj Surj, and the ride next to the Burj Surj. For food I would recommend Ali's Barbecue restaurant. Since it has many choices of food and they all are really delicious. I got a Chicken burger, with an ice cream at the end and that pretty much fills you for the rest of the day. The park closes around six o'clock, so you guys can enjoy and have a lot of fun by then. The locker rooms also have showers and soap, so I you do want to have a bath you can. After you have had all of your fun, you can go to the photo counter and collect all of the photos you have taken and you can upload those to your computer. Have an amazing time because my family and I did!"

Having previously lived in Dubai this was one of my sons favourite water parks and on this visit did not disappoint. Due to the time of year queues were minimal the temps were a chilly 29 degrees but purchase of a 'shorty' wetsuit from the sales in the Mall of Emirates the day before put paid to any shivering. It was nice to see the park quieter than on my previous visits but with all the rides still open. A really nice touch was the huge heated wave pool in the children's area, this allowed for re-heating in-between chutes and rides. The staff in Wild Wadi are fantastic ready to help at any time and the Foot Long Hot Dogs are a great hit with my Son Overall a great day out, the only issue I always have is persuading my Son to leave!"

For \u00a350 per person, I was expecting lots of rides but it's actually just one big course split into sections, a couple of slides, surf/wave things and a large shallow swimming pool in the middle. You pay extra for things like having your feet nibbled by fish. You get your bag searched as they don't like you bringing your own food and drink - my bottled water was ok but if it was a soft drink then that would be a no-no. We had difficulties understanding the guy at the entrance and we didn't realise that we'd paid for a small locker (\u00a36) but used a large one not knowing it was \u00a312. When we asked a member of staff about this, we were suddenly surrounded by other staff pointing out that there were signs and that it was very clear and we were wrong. How rude! The changing rooms were poor. Again, for the price, I'd expect at least hairdryers. I went to the toilet and came out to use the hand dryer when a member of staff rushed over to check no one was using it to dry their hair!It's ok for families but if you want exhilarating rides, it's not a patch on the white water centre where I work!"

The do offer towels and there is decent food on offer. in terms of hygene I am not convinced they could ever keep it to an acceptable level given the numbers of people allowed in at any one time. once we saw solid poo in the childrens' section and all they did was to remove it and let kids back in...but I am sure this is the same in any such parks. It is a reasonable size park with some real good rides aimed at older kids. There are couple of areas for younger kids too. so there is something for everyone. It is worth a visit"

It has about 5 main waterslides to ride of which 2 need 2 to 4 riders and one is very wild. The other two use jets to propel you up and down. After lunch the park got busier and we had to wait to ride. There are different areas to relax but hard to find shaded areas.The entrance was quite expensive at 270 per person but we had a coupon for BOGOThe locker was also not free of charge and needed if you didn't want to leave valuables on a beach chair. The food menu was aimed at kids and offered burgers and hot dogs and also on the expensive side.It was a fun day out but bring your wallet."

It is a good day out if your have a family with you (our kids were 8,12,15) and there was plenty of fun had by all. It is the kind of place you have to go to once and was certainly a better option than walking around the malls. Take lots of sunblock and lots of money as we found the tickets and food a bit pricey (but what attraction isn't?)"

We were staying at Jumeirah Emirates Towers and got free entry. We presented our key cards with the holder that had the room number. The guy still felt the need to ring someone, probably to check we were genuine guests. He didn't tell us what he was doing either! He didn't get through so ended up letting us in anyway. We felt that people of a certain other ethnicity wouldn't have had this issue.2. My Kingdom for a locker! A large locker was the only size that would fit belongings for two adults and two young children . It cost 70 dhms. That's around \u00a314! As guests we thought our trip would be for free, obviously not!3. The Bucket of Doom. Every five minutes or so a huge container of water above the kids slides would empty its entire contents over those using the slides. Great fun right? Wrong! There was no warning, it was a powerful stream of water, the water was cold, and it absolutely terrified my 5 year old who got caught underneath it and wasn't very comfortable in the water to begin with.4. Prison Camp? The security checks were so thorough that I expected a strip search was coming up. Every bag was checked carefully. The main issue? Food and drink so that you have to buy their overpriced equivalent. We still managed to sneak a bottle of water in, result!5. Is a warm shower too much? The water was either boiling or cold, these guys don't do compromise. My 2 year old was cold, after a few minutes of fiddling he left colder and disappointed.If you've read so far then congratulations and leave me a like!"

On the tower slides there is no need to drag the rafts up the stairs as they have lifts for that. Also small groundsize, keep in mind with many rides, so saves you from walking a marathon. Last but not least, wristband payment system so no way you can get your waller or key lost. Would definitely visit again. PS If you have a car, after closing it is worth to visit f.e.

The wave pool is great fun, and if you have little kids the proximity to the kids water play area is very useful.The two body boarding surf wave pools offer plenty of opportunity to show off, or to show yourself up. The family rides Burj Surj and Tantrum Alley are great fun, and for the more extreme thrill seeker you can try the Jumeirah Scarer, which has a dropping floor!At lunch time you have a choice of food, although most of it involves chips and soda, would be nice to have some more healthy options. That being said, the Chicken Shawarma is great!At peak times of year there can be over crowding, which can cause queues for rides, but that's probably to be expected."

From my first impressions I feel it looked well organised with friendy staff. When I visited there were not many people at all so plenty of room for those who chose to visit that day. I noticed so many life guards in all areas of the place which should give comfort with plenty of life vests to ware if you feel the need. Many places to sit although what it's like in peak season may be a different matter! Some small shops with places to eat also in the park. Great fun for both adults and children."

It's kind of cool how there's a sign before each ride that shows a scale of how thrilling the ride is. I didn't try the \"surfing\" rides, but I loved all the other ones. I even went on a few of them more than once! I didn't try the food because we spent three hours there and felt that it was sufficient."

The water slides are great fun - the Jumeirah scream and the Burj surj were my favourites. The wrist bands are brilliant - so much easier paying for drinks and food with the bands rather than going back and forth to the lockers. I was really surprised at the price of food - I expected it to be the usual sky high prices like most parks but it was decent prices with quality food! I had a chicken kebab from the BBQ and it was delicious. Lovely views of the Burj too!"

The two raft rides, Tantrum Alley and Burj Surj are certainly great fun, however please note Tantrum Alley is certainly not for the faint hearted. The rest of the park remains the same from when it first opened and to be honest it shows. Considering the price they charges to day guests I can not say that this is a value for money day out. Don't even get me started on the price of food and beverages inside the park. At least they don't stop you taking in water, 1 litre per guest if memory serves me correct.To put my review in to some kind of perspective, I had recently visited two water parks in Florida, USA. Both parks were well over 10years old, however both parks offered far more by way of thrills, spills and excellent value for money. Unfortunately Wild Wadi receives just 3 (Average) mostly due to the exorbitant pricing."

Complimentary towels are provided. The park, despite being built in the late 1990s is well maintained and doesn't feel tired. Its location adjacent to the Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah Beach hotels gives it an imposing outlook. It is quite compact compared to 'Aquaventure' at the Atlantis, which we went to a couple of years ago and not so open or aesthetically pleasing, but the rides are nevertheless fantastic. Tantrum Alley was probably the most thrilling for me with Jumeirah Sceirah close behind. The latter was over very quickly and riders are at risk of scraping their shoulder blades on the way down, as I did. There are plenty of loungers or chairs available around the park and lockers at a charge, should you need them. The lunchtime food was reasonably priced, particularly when compared to food and drink at our hotel! I particularly liked the facility of being able to 'load' your wrist band with money to use around the park for food, lockers etc. in the absence of your wallet - any balance remaining is refunded in cash at the end of your day. All in all a great day out with the kids and no sign of any massive queues for taxis when we left!"

The Wild Wadi is quite a small waterpark but the rides are great. Jumeirah Scream is amazing I have never come off a water ride with my legs shaking before! The build up when you are locked in the pod is pretty terrifying and I normally love this sort of thing the feeling when the floor falls away and you are falling vertically is pretty intense but very exhilarating. The two huge ring rides are great especially Tantrum Alley which is a real adrenalin rush, at one point it feels like you are being flung off the ride. Master Blasters are good too a series of water jets which push you uphill all around the park. Well worth a visit it was quiet so were able to go on everything in a few hours. If I was paying I might be tempted to go to Atlantis, but as this place was free, we could get there by buggy and was on our doorstep it could not be beat. Like most of Dubai all the staff were very friendly and helpful.."

We got there for about 11 and it was just beginning to get busy. My favourite was the wild waveS...such good fun and after going on a few rides we would always come back to the wild waves..great for kids too as they had fab life jackets and jackets for adults too....we got the vouchers from the Entertainer so for myself and my daughter I paid \u00a350. It was a real relaxed atmosphere and we were able to leave our belongings on the deck chairs and no one touched them. We did have to wait about 45 mins for a taxi when leaving but you do have the option to use the posh lexus taxis. This water park caters for all age groups...I think I would love to have an adult only day...it would be so much fun:) a definite must when you visit Dubai."

Wished the metro ran to the park as if you are not staying in a nearby hotel getting a taxi can be a nightmare. Most people leave the park in the late afternoon when the taxi shifts change and both times we left we had to wait over an hour for a taxi. We also found it disappointing that the park shut at 6,30pm. We thought it would stay open much later than that. There seems little reason for it to close so early given the staggeringly good year round climate Dubai enjoys, but these are small gripes - overall we had a fab time and will visit again when we return."

The rides were very good with plenty of life guards at hand should they be needed. The only negative we had as a group was that the food vendors didn't really cater for us...we have a milk intolerant child and up to today we hadn't come across any issues throughout our stay in Dubai maybe that is something wild wadi could maybe look at?"

As we stayed with a jumeirah hotel we were given complimentary access to this water park and a free bus ride there.Arrived around 10am and had to que for about 20 mins or so. A tip when buying tickets. You will probably need a locker to keep your clothes and bags in etc. If you're buying a ticket or getting in for free save time buy asking them to load the wristband so you can use a locker. It costs to do so and you can pick a small or large. Small locker is ample to store 2 people's stuff in. Lots of things to see and do whilst there. A must do is the slide is the Jumeirah Sceirah. Wow what a water slide. Crazy adrenaline rush, super scary but definately worth a go even if you are a wimp like me. Glad I was able to say I did it. Burj Surj and Tantrum Alley\u00a0were great. When heading to Flood River Flyer\u00a0this was pretty weird to find. Keep your eyes peeled. You've got to cross the river flowing. Definately worth a go though.Plenty of food places to eat and lots of places to catch some sun or stay in the shade. A great spot to chill was on a roof terrace facing the Burj Al Arab. We managed to spend 8 hours at the park and didn't get bored. We also purchased a little something from the shop. This is a must do especially if you get in for free!!!!"

First of all it is not cheap at over 170 pounds for a group of 3 but when you consider you are entertained for 7/8 hours it is bearable.There are plenty of rides varying from leisurely through to the heart stoppers. There are always plenty of rings to ride and loads of lifeguards keeping an eye on you.There are plenty of beds throughout the park with welcome shade available if you are smart at picking the right ones.The parks location also affords you some excellent photo opportunities to get the Burj Al Arab in the background.One tip worth bearing in mind is that you are allowed to take in your own water rather than purchasing inside, but you are not allowed to take in food. We did eat in the park and it was pretty decent although a bit on the expensive side.So even considering the pricey entry costs it is a grand day out in pleasant and very clean surroundings."

It gets busier after 3pm.The kids loved the wave pool (life jackets provided make it really fun and safe!), there is also a water soft play area that we all enjoyed for hours. Plenty of sun beds / chairs to rest but we didn't actually have the time to use them. 2 family members are coeliac and the website says the park caters for food allergies - however only safe thing we found to eat was a plate of water melon. The fast food restaurant offered to make separate chicken for us but weren't that keen to do it and we didn't want to risk it for cc so turned it down. When we went to the food carts the person told us nothing was gf either. Also beware - magnums in Dubai (only ice cream they offered) contain wheat - they are different to the U.K.So go along, have fun but on arrival when they check your bag to remove food, it is advisable that you insist you must take in that food or maybe call in advance as they may be able to prepare something in advance if they are prepared for your visit.

It is a very expensive day out costing us around \u00a3200 in total. Roughly \u00a350 entrance fee each. Cost about \u00a325/30 for three burgers, fries and drinks. Other purchase was locker rental and 150 dirhams for photos taken during the day.....got them done as a digital download so got 11 photos that we had taken for that price. That said what a great water park. Very evident throughout the day was how polite, friendly and efficient ALL staff were. We didn't find it too crowded, we got sun loungers easy enough but we were there as it opened. When you pay to get in you get a \"watch\" which you can load cash onto for spending during the day which saves you keeping your purse out with you and can leave it in the lockers.if you don't spend everything on your \"watch\" they give you the cash back at the end of the day. Lots of photographers around so plenty of photo ops and we didn't feel pressured to buy. On leaving we tried the Halloween basement a walk through horror experience. I bottled it within the first 2 mins but hubby continued on said it was good. Only lasted a few mins. Left around 5pm and had quite a wait for a taxi, apparently this is around the shift turn over time, was a bit of a pain but the taxi system is very well organised so we eventually got home."

Our hotel (Jumeirah Zabeel Saray) provides free shuttle bus to go there and a free entrance and towels. The lockers we had to buy ourselves and we were not informed of that, so spend some time going back to the shop to buy lockers (three sizes, large one was whopping 65 dirhams). You get a wrist watch at the gate and you can load money to it to pay for locker, food, drinks etc. The locker can be opened as many times as you wish, which was not clear to us in the beginning. The staff was very helpful and friendly.We enjoyed the wave pool (plenty of life jackets in all sizes, if somebody is not a good swimmer), the eleven slides ride (just suberb! One or two person floaters and the waterway goes up and down all in one go. They had personnel in the water to help you if needed) and the multi-person raft slide (was great and less intimitating than it seemed. Took awhile to climb up to the highest point in the park for the slide). We did not try the one that drops straight down in the beginning. Also skipped the surfing.Took refreshing pina colada slush and eat potato skins in Juha's family kitchen. One reason for the missing one star was the food choises, fried or pizza with expensive prices, the other was the confusing beginnings. It would help to have signs explaining things when one queues in,p. There would be plenty of time to read and understand how things work and how much money would one like to load on the wrist watch thingy.There was a nice sun bed area facing the Burj Al Arab hotel, away from the bustle below. There is no access to the beach, fences and a walk path separate it. Cabanas are tucked in between the fence and the lazy river, but we didn't buy them. Cabana users seemed to have a fast pass lane for the water slides.Will go back if ever I am in Dubai."

Good thrill.I went alone with adults, for children they will not beable to go on all rides there are 11 rides in total. If child is under 8 he can only go in 3/4 rides so a money waste for them. Showers are v.cleanPrice is allot especially when you again need to pay for using their lockers. \u00a350 plus more. We brought our tickets from our hotel 15 dirhams less then the website price.

It has dozens of exciting rides and a great overall ambiance. If you are a water lover, this is the place to be when in Dubai. Park has so much to offer so to enjoy it optimally, one has to go early and plan well on the map. Some rides and pools may captivate you and you would miss many of the other exciting attractions so plan your time intelligently. Entry fee is little steep but guys, it definitely provides value for money. While using rides and attractions, boxers, dress shorts and nickers are not allowed so don't forget to bring proper swimming shorts and costumes as inside they are very expensive. Go light, as using in-park lockers can be tricky and would waist a lot of time/money. Do bring a water-proof case/jacket for your cell phone or buy 1 inside to have great selfies on your own phone. Many park-providing camera men but very expensive."

Individual person is locked in a tube which is located way above ground level and after 3-2-1 countdown below portion opens and we goes through the ride so speed and within a 3 seconds we reach on the ground. All the rides are nice and Burj sur ride is also very nice to enjoyyy. We love wildwadi."

            "review": "Family Fun For All Ages. Wild WadiThis is a must if your in Dubai. I have been 3 times and each time it has been both a fun and completely different experience. The rides are long and you get a far amount of incidental exercise climbing stairs and getting from one point to another but it is worth it as it disperses the crowds and allows you to have an enjoyable time without feeling crowded. They are plenty of staff on hand to direct, assist or supervise and the grounds are kept immaculately clean and tidy. There is a large wave pool with beach lounges that you can set yourself up at for the day. Lockers are available but probably not necessary as everyone seems to leave there bags and belongings without worrying about it. Private cabanas are available but not necessary unless you seek maximum privacy. The wave pool is very well supervised with a number of lifeguards keeping a close eye on activities and areas tend to be zoned depending on the age of your children. All the rides are great, some slower than others and then a couple for the maximum adrenaline rush. My recommendation is not to wear your best swimmers as the first time I went I ended up with a hole in my bikini bottoms due to the force of the water and slide. The food at the park is standard fast food so if you want something healthy I recommend you take it with you. We had swamanas (kebabs) and watermelon for lunch as this was the healthiest options available. I think Wild wadi is much better than the water park at the Atlantis as it caters to everyone and has more variety. You can get a number of different types of tickets depending on your desire to ride but if you get the ultimate pass you can ride all day as many times as you like and so it ends up being good value. We spent 6 hours at the park and left feeling exhausted and completely happy after having a great day of slipping and sliding."

Its a good place to enjoy and to cool down from the hot climate.Location is superb with a superb view of Burj Al Arab.you have to hire a taxi to get there.If you are coming by you own vehicle then they have a very good parking facility.Area is not that big but they have some good rides like Jumeirah Sceirah,Tantrum Alley, Burj Surj etc.Entrance fees is 295 dhs per Adult.which is very high, in fact its not worth spending 295 for this park.try to get Buy 1 Get 1 offers like from ' The Entertainer' vouchers( i always use that ) .Anyway Entrance is free for the Jumeirah guests and they are allowed to get inside the park one hour prior to the working hours.They wont allow to bring food inside the park, even though one bottle of water is allowed.food inside the park is damn expensive.The least expensive food is chicken shawarma which costs 50 dhs !!!! a small burger costs 59 dhs and a small pepsi costs 20 dhs.They have locker facility - we have to pay for it and its non refundable. Small size is 35 dhs, Medium - 50 dhs and Large is 65 dhs. please note that - large pants are not allowed to wear inside the park so better bring shorts inside. Otherwise get ready to get Shocked as the price for a short starts from 180 dhs ( yea, i mean it ) .Despite all these its a good place to spent 6-7 hours nad to escape from the hot climate of UAE."

He was a bit apprehensive at first about going down the slides, but with some encouragement from the very friendly lifeguards he soon overcame any fears and there was no stopping him ! I can't praise the lifeguards enough and the staff in general who were also very friendly, especially good with children. The entry fee isn't cheap, although children aged 2 and under are free. However if you spend a full day in here you do get your money's worth. The only downside as such is the price of the food and drink....\u00a310 or thereabouts for an adult fast food meal and \u00a34 fit drinks ! Other than that we had a fab day and would definitely recommend it to anyone who's visiting Dubai."

There are ride and attractions for children of any age, but there are height restrictions on some of the rides.As far as I know, I have been on all of the rides over the years, except the Jumeirah Sceirah. I'd heard about it from other guests in the hotel, and have since looked it up on the internet, and I am certain I made the correct decision NOT to go. Apparently, you stand in a capsule, the floor opens and you plunge 120 metres at 80 kph! Not for me. Tantrum Alley is fast and furious, and the Burj Surj is even faster. My son said I looked terrified throughout, whilst my two granddaughters aged 5 and 7 loved it and wanted to go again.It is an absolutely great day out, and I strongly recommend going early, as it does get very busy later on.Entrance is free to anyone staying in a Jumeirah hotel, otherwise I may be put off by the high cost of admission. AED 285 (approx \u00a353.50) for an adult, and AED 240 (\u00a345) for a child under 1.1 metres tall."

We chose Wild Wadi as the park to go to over another well known water park. Tickets aren't cheap but there is plenty to keep you occupied for a good few hours. Our visit on Mon 27th Sept 2015 was a super hot day and we both wore long sleeved surf tops (a must if you don't want to fry). Most of the slides are all ring based but but this only added to the speed on some of the slides. Some rides even shoot you upwards leaving you gasping for breath or screaming in fun.....overall we had 4 hours of fun on the slides and enjoyed every minute of being flung around in the super cool water."

We have been to at least 15 waterparks worldwide and this one is right up there with the best! The up hill water coasters were the best and the views of the Burj Al Arab and the jumeirah beach hotel and beach from the park are amazing. All staff/life guards were so friendly and looked genuinely happy to work there. Food was great value, we ate in the bbq and had tandoori chicken with chips and pitas and a large coke each with 2 bottles of water and was under \u00a320, was delish and gave us loads of energy to enjoy the park until closing. We loved the chashless system where you top up money to a wristband, such a great idea! Also we loved how the walk ways were shaded so you don't need to wear your flip flops because you won't burn your feet, very well thought out! Everything was so safe too so even the big slides, although thrilling were very safe and we felt the staff went out of their way to make sure everyone were kept safe as a priority. There is something here for everyone of any age and what a great way to cool down in the 40 degree heat!!"

I felt the lockers were a little pricey and be warned the price goes up with the size of the locker with the smallest locker starting at 115 AED equilivant of nearly 30 euro, so pack lightly.Also male and female changing is separate and there is no family changing rooms available as we witnessed one poor Fathers dismay as he had two daughters with him. Any one travelling from Europe tend to forget this as we are used to having family changing areas readily available.We went during the week so there was little or no queueing and all the rides were working efficiently. The staff have to be complimented they are the most friendly and helpful and by far the nicest we encoutntered in any attraction in Dubai.The area is well maintained and very clean, be warned though given the heat the ground is unbearably hot in places, as flip flops have to be removed for rides I would recommend swimming shoes to protect your feet especially for kids. We had a quick bite to eat , fast food is readily available and we were surprised by the high quality of what we received. The \u201cWipeout Burger\u201d is totally recommended. Merchandise and souvenirs are quiet expensive but expected and at a par with any of the other waterparks in both Europe and the US.Deck chairs and seating areas are available in all areas but those around the wave pool appear to be the busiest.There\u2019s also an option for a fish pedicure for an addition 55 AED this is relaxing and it\u2019s a nice option to take you out of the sun. It lasts 20 minutes but we were allotted an extra ten minutes as they were not busy which we appreciated.Lifejackets are readily available and free of charge for both adults and children.One thing that stood out and can often be overlooked was the lifeguards on duty, as some one that spent their college years as a part time lifeguard I feel I have a good insight. The lifeguards by far are the most efficient and observant lifeguards I have ever come across in a waterpark. I would complement the lifeguards on the wave pool who I witnessed doing numerous rescues, they were never once distracted from their duties and there professionalism was unquestionable. It is quite obvious that there is a well-structured training programme in place and the importance of their duties does not seem to have been lost sight of by any of the lifeguard personnel. They are a credit to the park. We enjoyed our day at the park, it\u2019s both suitable for kids and adults and would highly recommend"

We arrived shortly after the park opened at 10am, as advised to go on all the bigger rides first before the park got too busy. We were soooo lucky that all day we were able to go on the rides without queuing! Max 15 minutes during peak time around 2pm for the most popular rides! but mostly we walked straight on :-)This is my favourite waterpark EVER! Due to their amazing tyre rides - there is one that goes on for 15 minutes as you're jetted along tubes from one pool to the next, and then you finish up floating down the lazy river on your tyre :-) Amazing! There is a great choice of single or double tyres too. There are more extreme tyre rides (climb the many steps up the tower), which we loved too! You are sat on larger rafts and be prepared to get very wet - hold on tight!!!There are also 2 awesome surfing rides - never done these before but highly recommend! Plus usual kamikazes, wave pools, kids area etc etc. Definitely recommend for a fun day out - I want to go back!!Entry is 275AED, \u00a350 each, but I searched online and was able to buy tickets cheaper from a third party and we paid around \u00a384 for our 2 tickets. Extra charges for lockers (65AED, \u00a312, non refundable) and to hire towels - but you can take your own. Allowed to take bottled water, but not food. The park has a great choice of places to eat and drink, pricey but not too crazy expensive.We took our go pro down the rides with us and got some great photos. There are also great views of Burj Al Arab from the waterpark. Such a fun day here - a must visit!"

It is one of the best in town, a bit expensive but the location is great, between Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah Beach Hotel. You will find a lot of water slides inside, pools that create waves, surfing pool and many more. It is a very high tech water park that should not be missed during your holiday in Dubai! Best regards, BogdanRomania."

First the good points, we visited when it wasn't very busy, apparently the last 3 days had been packed solid. The water park was fantastic, really clean with excellent facilities, a bit small, but still nice for a really hot summers day. The staff were friendly and professional. A word of warning wear flip flops because the concrete can be a bit course on bare feet. We had entertainer vouchers, buy one get one free, which really softened the blow. Paying \u00a360 is a bit much for one person I think. Now the bad points. My mate dislocated his shoulder on one of the water rides (he'd done it years ago, apparently it pops out ).We were quickly shown to the first aid station and he was given 2 ibuprofen tablets, useless because he was in agony, but understandable because they never had anything stronger. Now the bad news, they said we had to go to the hospital by TAXI. We were taken out of the park through the back entrance as if we had robbed the place. To make matters worse WE HAD TO PAY FOR THE TAXI OURSELVES. The taxi driver told us that he had been here on numerous occasions with other injured people from the water park, he always parked around the back and they NEVER called an ambulance because it would draw negative attention to the park . The taxi driver said that if we'd been locals we'd have called an ambulance straight away and got to the hospital (in diera ) in 15 minutes rather than the 40 minutes it took him, while my mate was in agony. Shocking the way we were treated. SHOCKING"

We only went here one day during our visit as we didn't have much time in Dubai and we had a fun day.When we were leaving and walking to the taxis a man approached us, which we thought was a taxi driver and told us a car was available and helped with our bags to a lexus car. It was only when we were in the car that we realised that the car had no meter and no sticker on the window, he charged us 3-4 times more to go to the mall than the rate should have been. It was our first day in Dubai and didn't know any better. So just a warning to anyone leaving the Waterpark to make sure you get into a proper taxi!"

We did visit Wild Wadi for about 9 days running.This is what we normally do if we are staying in one of the Jumeira residencies.I was dismayed to discover that this year they had finished their promotion where if you buy one of their big drinks cups you can refil each time for 5-6 dirhams. Which with a couple of drink guzzling kids around, it was a no brainer.I had a lengthy conversation (argument) with Fernando at the food station by the kids play area. I did have the backing of my wife who during the discussion I looked around for some backing was disapearing into the distance.Honestly nothing personal as he was only trying to do his job but he didn\u2019t have a clue what he was on about. He was trying to tell me that Wild Wadi had never had this offer? And that he was on the board that decides these matters? Odd as I still have the beakers with wild wadi on them from our last visit, I also have the beakers from Aquadventure by The Atlantis Hotel from last year where they had exactly the same deal.Now the deal is, you pay something like 80 dirhams up front and again some for the refill, but this only lasts a day. I would have to drink my whole bodyweight in fluids to make this work, would spend half my day in the toilet and would not be able to to take part on the rides from carbon dioxide poisoning.Come on Wadi board \u2013 That is mean.It just meant that we didn\u2019t stay as long and we didn\u2019t buy drinks there.By the way the rides were good!Would I go again, yes, if I owned shares in the company"

My friend went in October and another friend went in December the queues were a lot longer then. The staff are friendly and there are photographers at the end of some rides who are really good and captured some amazing pictures of me and my husband. The changing rooms are clean with cleaners always present. We bought our swim wear from the waterpark shop including slippers that we could keep on the rides, this was all a bit pricey but we can re use it on our next visit. We ate near the entrance i didnt really like the food as apart from burgers and hot dogs there isnt much choice and there is very limited seating for when your eating. Overall the water park is safety conscious with life gaurds at every corner and it is very clean for a waterpark, i cant wait to go again when i have children as it is a lovely place for children. The surroundings are beautiful and the rides are brilliant, would definetly recommend this place for a memorable and exciting day out with the family or with friends."

You can put money on your wristband and spend it as you like. The only downside is the cost of food and drink, it's expensive and unnecessarily expensive. The rides are fun and last long enough to make the effort of getting to the top worthwhile. The queues are ok and the staff very helpful, friendly and welcoming. The wave pool is fun, having the life jackets gives the kids a lot of confidence. There's plenty of slides for the kids and enough rides to keep hen entertained. A good day out, you can get round the park in a day and ride the rides repeatedly.

The water slides that use the rubber rings are great start off on ground level and they push you up a height and let you free all. (No hassle of carrying g rings around) Great experience.

It is much quicker and easier to fit in lots of rides than at Atlantis as the grounds are not as big. Really enjoyed the wave pool! Definitely make use of the free entry if you are staying in one of the Jumeirah properties. The buggy takes you up to the hotel guest entrance, free towels are provided so you don't need to take anything with you. As with all waterparks in hot countries, I would recommend buying pool shoes in the park. They can be used on all of the slides and make walking on the hot grounds a lot more comfortable."

This is a rather small water park compared to those we have visited in places such as Bali and Abu Dhabi, this means you probably only need half a day to visit. The entrance fee is also very high (about \u00a3100 for 2 adults). Fortunately as we were staying at one of the Jumeriah Hotels the facility was complementary. Would recommend visiting in the morning, as temperatures get very hot later in the day, and the crowds increase meaning long waits in hot weather for most of the rides. We visited at 10.30am and it was fairly easy to get on all the rides. While not big there are some fun rides, so if you have half a day to spare and don't mind getting there early this facility is worth a visit."

Heads-up, staff are pretty strict about wearing flipflops while riding slides. Even if you offer to wear them on your arms so that you wouldn't have to walk back to the start to pick them up again. So, leave your flipflops in the locker room :)Since it's a small waterpark, get ready for lots of stairs."

Having been to Aquaventure so many times I felt like this would be a let down but not at all. We now have a 2 yr old and it was perfect for him. Admittedly the rides are a bit in need of tlc as they're rusting etc. And generally it's not as exciting for adults as Aquaventure but as a non - swimmer and mother of a toddler it was great for me and little one and there was enough to keep DH amused too as he's more of a keen adventurer. Food was extortionate ..paid like \u00a310 for a shwarma meal. Lockers are about 35AED for a small one. Take your own towel as it costs like 60AED to hire. We also used the Entertainer 2 for 1 entry voucher which was fab and little ones under 2 are free. Overall we had a blast, one of our best days in dubai."

The water park was really nice, although it appears much bigger than it already is. The rides were very fun and refreshingly cool from the summer heat. It was, however, crowded. The lines were not terrible though. The food is just ordinary theme park type food that is overpriced. We stayed for a few hours, as we had done everything and had some time to just lounge. My girl and I are adults with no kids, so perhaps this is more of a family destination versus a couples spot. It was nice to enjoy the cool water and fun rides none the less, but I would have been disappointed had I paid full price for admission for two."

Tantrum alley and Jumeirah Screirah are by far the best rides. Adrenaline rush of note. The rest are pretty tame but also are a great way too relax and \"chill\".Drinks and food are expensive. Hideously so, but you expect that from theme parks. Overall a terrific way to spend a morning and feel like a teenager again before heading off to the malls and downtown Dubai.I've heard it can get chaotic during peak times so check before you go. You can wait up to an hour for some rides and they can be pretty congested. (So I've heard. We've always been in September so it's not bad at all)Take good sunscreen with.

There is a charge for lockers starting from 35 dirhams but dont get caught out like us - they are the small ones and for the large lockers is 65 dirhams - approx \u00a310! You are only charged once for using them so my husband and I shared one. We didnt eat here but a bottle of water was about \u00a32. We visited very early 10.15am and the park was quiet...perfect as it was already 36 degrees and we went straight on the rides with no queing. Rides 1-5 are brilliant esp the Jumeirah Sceirah. Pay attention to the ride rating if you dont want any hidden shocks. Something for everyone here and wonderful views of the Burj Al Arab. If you dont spend all the money on the wristband you can get the rest refunded. Also don't forget to tell them you are at one of the Jumeirah chain hotels so that you dont get charged for renting a towel 35 dirhams (\u00a36.50). Would definately visit again."

I have kids aged 7 and 9 and this park definitely kept them entertained. Avoid going on a Friday or Saturday as it gets really busy. We went on a Wednesday and arrived at 10am. We were able to get on all the rides without having to wait in queues. Please note that it may be better to bring your own towel as otherwise you will incur additional costs. The lockers are great but a medium size locker was enough for 4 people. You cant bring your own food into the park but there is a range of food to choose from. You can top up your wrist band with money which means you don't have to carry cash around with you. If you don't spend everything, you can get the money back at the end of the day."

Recent visit to Dubai - 8/2015 - went to WWWP with my wife and 3 boys (ages 6,8,11) - park entrance ticket based on height - tickets over \u00a350 as everyone over 1.1 meters, less than 1.1 meters aren't much cheaper). We used Arabian tours company based in Dubai and they got us much cheaper tickets saved around \u00a37 per person. The water park is compact, has lots of slides - our favorite was wave pool (plenty of life jackets for novices so need to spend any money), burj sooraj and tantrum alley (sit in tubes)- these rides my 6 and 8 year old enjoyed (but its a bit of walk up to the top) - the jumeriah scarer (probably misspelt) is a high adrenalin ride and near vertical drop my 11 year old loved this and went on it several times - he also enjoyed the surfer rideKids area with compulsory large bucket which empties every few minutes - amused my 6 year old every time - finally lazy river where you can relax and float on tubes There are plenty of eateries dotted around the park The park has free WiFi - tip connect at the entrance as harder to connect once in the parkYou have a watch like device which you can charge with credit so you don't have to keep cash with you (also used for locker - tip if you use this on wrong locker wipes off your cash credit so be careful)Tip - If family - just get a big locker there was 5 of us and we manged to fit everything in easily If you are deciding between this and Atlantis - I prefer this - why more rides my kids can go on (height restriction on Atlantis rides is 1.2 meters) - no WiFI at Atlantis you have to pay for it - Atlantis lots of landscaping so rides are far apart - no preloaded electronic cash so have to carry your wallet with you ? but you have access to the beach - the lazy river has a few nice surprises ( but the wave pool is a disappointment) - the kids area is just as large and pretty much similar - they do have a few different high adrenalin rides so older children may prefer this to Wild Wadi - eating places several with one large sit in restaurant which is great - the costs are similar! again cheaper through tour companies"

We brought our own towels and we were ready to hit the rides. We visited on a Sunday as this should be a quieter day compared to a Friday or Saturday. We were not dissapointed the longest we had to queue all day was around 20 minutes on the matter blaster due to a blockage around the course. We did almost every ride several times and it was great. I felt safe and the untold amount of life guards and staff add to that feeling. A great day out topped of with very expensive souvenir photos to remind my son and I of our special day together."

My 7 year old was put into an oversized ring by disinterested and frankly incompetent staff.They should not be wearing shirts with the word life guard on it. When he was shot up the ramp his back was scraped along the metal runners and despite screams of pain was completely ignored. I jumped out of my ring and grabbed him with again no response or question from anyone. I then checked his back and found multiple red welts where his skin had been taken off the length of three vertebrae having torn through his wet shirt. God only knows what would have happened had he let go in pain or if he was not wearing a shirt. He is a very tall boy for his age and he is now badly hurt for the rest of our trip. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS HERE IT IS NOT SAFE THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING THEM FROM FLYING OFF THE RINGS EXCEPT THEIR HANDS. THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING THEM SCRAPING UP THEIR BACKS. The park managers response was\"Maam this does not happen everyday\"To which I responded that if it did happen everyday they would be shut down. This park had no clue about the safety of children in my opinion.You would be risking your kids if you took them.Needless to say we left immediately. "

We paid 250AED for anybody over 1.1 metres (\u00a344) and 190 for anybody under 1.1 metres (\u00a333) a reasonable price.You need to buy a locker on arrival to store your belongings in this can be brought from the shop. Plenty of food and drink places dotted around the one I recommend is Alis BBQ. Very nice grilled menu and a good selection for kids. The Jumeirah Sceirah is a must!! Beware of the long waiting times as it's very popular but worth the wait.Also the wave pool is a nice place that all of us could hang out together.

Enough shade, and water seems to be temperature controlled to keep it cool.There were only a few good rides. The Tantrum Alley and the Sceirah, the latter being good only if you willing to overcome fear of highs, and floor being pulled from under your feet. Other water parks have much larger variety of rides for people with various tolerance to speed, height and fear.Food is expensive.Honestly felt Yas World in Abu Dhabi was better.Ques may not be as long because most tourists are probably going to the water park at Atlantis.The ques for the rides during the last hour dropped significantly even though more shade and sun setting."

At \u00a350 a head, we had relatively high expectations - this turned out not to be the case, we were in and out in 15 minutes.To begin, we queued up for 25 minutes in the blinding heat whilst one operative, on one till just casually chatted to other operatives, ignoring the queue. When we finally got to the front we just got attitude and had a wrist band literally thrown at us.We then proceeded to the changing rooms. Once we were changed we spent 20 minutes trying to put all our belongings into a locker which would not lock. It turned out despited having parted with \u00a350 each, we had to go line up again, with all our belongings in our arms, to pay another \u00a36 to lock the locker with our belongings in. It would have been useful to have known this in advance.By this time we were verging on heat stroke. On to the first ride. Trying to find a ride is not easy. Once there, you guessed it, another queue, we got to the front this time and the ride just stopped. Twenty minutes later I asked the life guard what was going on - I got a shoulder shrug and that was that.We tried to find another ride and failed. By this time we just needed a pool to cool down in - but you guessed it - no regular pool. There is a small wave pool really packed with small children - but to us the water as a result looked slightly suspect.We had visited this place to cool down, yet we were much hotter than before we started.So, if you want to part with a lot of cash, stand in a lot of queues, experience very few water rides and have no access to a regular pool to cool down, then this is the place for you.Like so much in Dubai - just because something looks the part, does not mean it is.More focus needs to go into the user experience which I have found to be generally poor- there is glaring plagerism everywhere but the essence of the experience is usually missing."

You cannot take money because it will get wet in the park. Specially in Dubai's weather which is super hot and humid. Second, you need to really take the whole container of your sunscreen lotion and renew it every half an hour. Otherwise, you will get really bad sun burn.

There are places to store your flip flops but you'll have to make your way back to the ride to pick them up with barefeet. But the park is kept really clean.Tips: go early and look out for Thursday evening women's only. Rides are labelled based in intensity with red the most intense. There are a couple of andrenalin inducing rides for singles and families. There are lots of lifeguards around and they are easy to spot.All in all a great experience let down by unhealthy options for snacks!"

My 14yr old daughter liked the more scary rides while my 5yr old son had a fabulous time in the wave pool and the small kids section were the giant bucket drenches everyone every few minutes. Height limit I think for rides is 1.1m and while my son is a couple of cm's under the limit he didn't kick up a stink we denied access to the bigger rides (phew!!) We have been here many times over the last 10 years and still enjoy it as much as the 1st time."

However we found we ended up going on all the yellow dingy rides , there are lots of them. We did avoid the steep tunnel ride and the surf boards as they were simply terrifying. I would recommend to get there as soon as it opens and plan to stay all day. Go on as many rides as possible in the morning before it gets too busy and you start queing up, approx after 12pm. Remember to take your swim clothes and towels (if you have a complimentary jumeirah pass , you have a free towel at the entrance). Lockers are expensive at \u00a310 for a mid sized locker and food and drink approx \u00a310 per head for lunch. You are not allowed to take your own food and are limited to 1/2 litre water. Also cameras unless waterproof can be pointless, they have official photographers everywhere, so make the most of them and get your tag after every picture. We ended up purchasing a usb with all the photos for \u00a340.A bit pricey, but still an amazing fun packed venue for all ages."

We did Aquaventure last year at this point of our vacation, so this year was Wild Wadi's turn and it did not disappoint. We thought we'd only spend 1/2 a day in the waterpark but got there around 11am and did not leave until nearly 7pm!!! Amazing value for money with more than enough to keep 2 suddenly much younger adults laughing & splashing between some fab thrill and fun rides. Lazy river is cool but it's the Master Blaster rides that had us in fits of laughter as they hurled us UP and around the park. Jumeirah Sceirah is a wicked drop chute (not as scary as the one at Aquaventure for anyone wondering) but it was Burj Surf that stole the show for us, as being a couple we don't get to go on the large 3 or 4 people ring rides normally. So glad you can at Wild Wadi as this ride had us belly laughing all the way down and had to be done multiple times :) AWESOME! Tantrum Alley was another in a larger ring and whilst a thrill was over too quick. Good layout to park with great food (if you go for the shawarmas, order for one and it'll be enough for 2 from the food outlet by the entrance/exit). Ample lockers and showers etc. Got some cool photos via the camera guys and auto cams around the park, great momento if a tad pricey. Overall though, thoroughly recommended. Oh and wait for near sunset if you can, the backdrop of the Burj Al Arab at that time is great - see photo ;)"

Full of slides, jet powered Rapids, lazy river and even little slides for children!! I thoroughly enjoyed slides and attractions that you wouldn't of dreamed of seeing in Britain, making centre parks look baby in comparison to the high intensity slides they have there!! The only down side is that unfortunately you are not allowed to bring your own food or drink into the park, which means you have to pay and purchase their food. Which you guessed it is expensive, however don't let that put you off!! Because despite that everything that you can do at Wild wadi is amazing, the highest adrenaline slide being that of the jumeriah scairah which is a slide in which you climb into a tube and the floor disappears and goes vertical down!! If you have the chance to go I suggest you do, as it's fun for everyone! Plus for souvenirs there is photographers and cameras everywhere on slides Rapids which are there to capture your fun through funny and amazing pictures which then they put on a wristband attached to your wrist so at the end you can check it out at the gift store!!! :) keeping the memories alive of wild wadi!! Good fun day out!!!"

We were 4 and entered there on July 15th at 12 . The weather was so hot , so we changed the cloth and started the path . There you could find several different thing to do . At first we enjoyed surfing and a trainer first trained us ,then we did our best. It was fabulous. Then we tried the river . Can you believe it? We tried it more than 20 times to 7P.M as it took about 15 minutes from beginning to end. Surely I would never forget this experience ;you go up and pass different parts, come down through dark tunnel, etc. Even We tried high slide and it was really frightening. For some seconds you feel nothing .For the first time it was shocking and frightening for me , but then we were accustomed to the excitement . After that we tried artificial lake . I didn`t like it first ,but after a while the artificial waves started to move and we really enjoyed . As though It was real sea. It was about 1P.M and it was lunch time. We had lunch ticket ,so enjoyed perfect hamburger, french fries and ice cool cola . We discovered another thing to do, went up the stair and reached a high place ,got in the boat all and went down .It was perfect and awfully frightening , even we couldn`t open our eyes . At 7 P.M we went out ,but unforgettable memory of WILD WADI would never fade from our memory .Now I am really satisfied t to pay money and enjoyed there ."

No doubt, Wild wadi is one of the best parks in Dubai, but if you have choice, Yas Water world (in Abu Dhabi) is a better option.The only thing which we noticed yesterday which I never experienced before that the staff was rude , especially at changing rooms when the park was closed. Everybody rushed to the changing rooms to have shower and staff was very rude as they wanted to clear the park as soon as possible. I believe they should understand that if the closing time for the rides is 7 pm, park will not be empty at once. Of course it needs time for every body to settle down , especially for families with kids."

We are now on our tenth year of visiting Dubai and luckily for us, daily entry to the Wild Wadi Water Park is part of our hotel package! We have always had a lot of fun enjoying the water rides. If you are a hotel guest and arrive at the WWWP late afternoon the queues are much smaller as a great many of the day guests have had enough of the dun and gone home! The lifeguards are very attentive and also provide some great interaction on some of the attractions. My only criticism on our most recent visit would be relating to the large groups of rowdy lads/men that seemed to stampede through the Lazy River attraction without a care for the other guests. Their cheering and hollering was annoying and their blatant disregard for the enjoyment and safety of others was obvious. My faith in the staff at the WWWP was restored when I saw a few members of one of the groups being escorted to the exit! Well done!!"

You can also have fishes eat the dead skin of your feet, but it costs extra (AED50?)There are plenty of sun loungers and chairs around the park.I wish that the park would allow you some beach access as well but it does not.FYI: The Entertainer Book offers 2-for-1 vouchersWe truly enjoy Wild Wadi and can recommend it!"

Wild wadi was approx. $90AUD per adult for the day, but we had 2x entertainer vouchers that were 2 for 1, so we ended up paying half price.We spent about 4 hours here and had a great time, waterslides were fun with a range of different levels of thrill. We are into more extreme rides and we weren't disappointed. Another plus was the waterslide that pushes you up the slide to the top with jets of water, all whilst sitting in your tube. This was a bit of a novelty and something we hadn't seen before at other parks. We bought lunch here which wasn't cheap, but expected in a theme park. Would recommend for a fun day out, a good way to beat the heat in the middle of summer."

No discount for babies and none for pregnant women (even though they won't let you ride on anything!)

I read from the existing reviews I should get there early, which was well worth the effort: I arrived at 9:45am (it opens at 10) and was the third person in the gate when it opened. There were no queues on any ride other than the flowriders (artificial wave generators you ride on. Board). I went mostly on the more adrenaline-pumping rides and the rapid tube ones that flowed uphill (very cool) to save you lining up further inside the park. I think it might have been a quieter day because it is Summer and Ramadan. The food options were really only fast food, which is very poor, but I can't let that get in the way of this being a five star attraction. Well worth a visit, especially if you are stating at the adjacent resort which entitles you to free entry.I'll also say that the staff were all very helpful and friendly, the place was very clean and safe, and it's great to see people from so many countries and cultures coming together in such a way to celebrate feeling like a kid again!

A healthy option in my opinion would be very successful for example nice salads (not McDonalds style), wraps, fish, low carb...when you pay so much to enter you tend to stay longer and are therefore forced to eat junk and then swim (it makes no sense)!

Very safe to leave your belongings whilst you explore the park. Lazy river was our first place but quickly spotted the faster version running alongside it. Can only be described as great fun, plenty of twists and turns, goes up quite high and you can see the busy road far below you at one point but adds to the excitement. Wasn't brave enough to try the ride that the floor falls away from you and you drop vertically ! The ride that takes up to four adults in a round inflatable is also great fun, screamed all the way down but didn't stop me from doing it again . I tried the feet cleansing with the tiny fish, not for me as I screamed for the first five minutes and it freaked me out. Didn't help when one bit me and blood was running into the tank, attend and told me I was unlucky as they only have one piranha and it found me lol ."

It is quite small and definitely not a full day thing unless you have children then. It's perfect, loads of lifeguards around which is good. There is a smoking area near the food court up the stairs! You can buy a case for your phone which is waterproof it's about \u00a320. Also if you want towels ask at the shop and you have to show your receipt !

Don't you think someone might get dehydrated and sick? That's very cheap behavior and definitely needs to be punished with one less star. ;)- Expensive fee for lockers.- Very expensive food at restaurants (2x more expensive than the city)."

But what infuriates me about this place is that they charge 275 EAD for the entrance and then an additional 55 for renting a locker. 55!!! And they know you have to rent one. Yes, there are cheaper lockers, but they are overpriced as well. And I wasn't informed until after I was ripped off. I walked right in to the men's locker room, chose the first available locker and BOOM.... Was charged 55 dirhams. Even though the cheapest locker has a price of 35 that's still ridiculous when you pay 275 to get in. Use of lockers should be free in a place like this. Shame on you, Wild Wadi, for using such cheap tourist trap tricks. But then again, you don't really make your money on regulars, do you?"

It was truly a great day full of fun. lots of games for adults and kids. Ques were not long and boring, though we went on a weekend (Saturday). Life Guards are very cooperative and doing a job that they love. they interact with people on every minute of the day and boost more fun. I never felt that those guys are on duty or just doing a 9 to 5 boring job.It is worth to mention that it is a very safe place. we have place valuable stuff on table, and kept going back and forth to check and it was never touched. I noticed that other visitors have left their valuables around, and it seemed that everyone is comfortable and there no one worried to be stolen or something.I have to say, that my only concern is only prices are bit high. It could be affordable for single person or a bachelor to go, but for a family man like me with kids, prices are very high. and meals provided are very expensive for no reason. Yet, you can't buy food from outside."

Even the most popular ride was less than a 5 minute wait. it is great if you are staying in the Jumeirah hotels, as you get free access. The only real issue was with walking to some of the slides, as the pavement and stairs got very hot! We discovered the trick is to take the \"water roller coaster\" that drops you off close to the entrance! Good fun for all ages."

Recommend renting a locker to keep everything safe. Take an underwater camera with you as they give you some great pictures...Enjoy"

My youngest enjoyed this the bestComplimentary life jackets are available FOC for the kids and are readily available, also loads of life guards everywhere  The main ride involves sitting on a single/double inflatable and better being jetted around the park. Overall, I highly recommend this water park, it's very clean and very well maintained , staff are very polite and helpful. My eldest really enjoyed all the rides including the lazy river and due to the location we had great views whilst on all the ridesI think if you have older kids, I would recommend Atlantis as the rides are more scary , but this is a great day out.I've been coming to this park many times over the last 10yrs and its still Highly recommended!"

Limited number of 'rides' so am not sure if you'd get bored after a couple of days, but worth a visit. Costs 275-300AED admission \u00a350/\u20ac70/$75, lockers 35AED per day, but you can at least lock away all your valuables. They also allow wrist bands that you can use to buy things, so no need for cash. Fast food is about \u00a38/\u20ac11/$12 for usual meal deals. Good day out."

Go early to avoid the queues and avoid Friday and Saturday as this is the weekend in Dubai."

The food / beverage cost also almost doubled !!If you have a choice, avoid this place and choose Yas Waterworld in Abu Dhabi, much better rides, greater variety, rides for all ages and good value for money (240 AED including entry and lockers). If you are stuck in Dubai, don't have time to travel to Abu Dhabi, try the Aquaventure in Atlantis.Tips: Book through Travel Agencies in advance, you will get some discounts. If you book any Jumeirah Group of hotels, you will get free entry to this place."

There are 3 rides which are thrilling and other rides are quite decent and suitable for anyone. even the thrilling ones are not extreme and my 5 yr old daughter managed quite comfortably . We chose saturday to avoid maximum rush on fridays. The idea worked and the queues were quite thin and the waiting periods were reasonable and short for a saturday. Various food options are available inside .Using Entertainer coupon helped us get 1+1 offer. We spent the whole day and repeated almost all the rides. Comparing to other waterparks in uae, Wild Wadi is as good as aquaventure waterpark but a little bit smaller . The lazy river was better in aquaventure . The parking is quite near in Wild wadi whereas aquaventure needs you to park quite far from the actual entrance. This is quite painful while returning back as the buses will be full and we will be too tired to walk the whole distance ( almost 10-15min walk ) back to the cars."

In Friday evenings they have ladies night, where it is only women allowed and we have the whole park to ourselves! It may not make sense to many people, but believe me if you wear a hijab and you want to enjoy the pool, this makes a HUGE difference. The scene in the evening is more clubby with great music blasting everywhere, giving you a great start to the weekend, and allowed me to really let my hair down...get it ;) But the only down side to that is that we were not allowed to take pictures to preserve the modesty of the other customers. The shop is great but as with most things in Dubai, it is pricey."

Me and my hotelier friends visitedth waterpark midday sun last May 19,2015.The over all experience is impeccable and be nicely reccommended.It was my third time visiting Wild Wadi until then ,I realized that it got something better and consistent on its services.My friends were impressed too.The first moment I swum to the cold water ,my knee got bruised .But the fun i enjoyed while riding all the rides took over the pain.This time ,I did not try the Jumeirah Sceirah.I only waited downside to took videos of my friends challenging the scary fall.The waterpark is so clean with great ambiance of happy people .You can hear the buzz of excitement and laughters.I must say ,out of 10 employees only one cared to worry about my bruise .He suggested I must go to the FA station.I forgot his name (sri Lankan) ,I met him at the master blaster.The huge waterpark has only 1 first aid station (near the main entrance) so I ignored heading up to go there since the floor is very sun-heated.There should be one more station on the other side of the park.Prices of drinks are expensive ,not a good value.My friend asked for iced drink without cream on top ,but the staff charged her 5 dirhams. I double checked the condition of locker rooms compared to the last time I visited.All suggestions I raised were implemented ,that includes plastic bags for wet clothes and shower gels .Now ,there are drying stations as well.Before ,there were none.Nicely done! Water sprayer fans across pathways would be appreciated to beat the summer heat. At the end ,hoteliers or residential rates should have f&b and other retail discount as well.We did not bother to bring home our souvenir picture unlike in Yas WW ,they offered us 120 aed (1 a4 +2 wallet size prints and 2 key chains or 2 key fridge magnets).Congratulations to all staff for your hardwork and dedication ,well definitely be back."

The cost as you can imagine is not that cheap - probably circa \u00a3100 for 2 adults.... once in you have to spend 5 minutes orientating yourself with where everything is....As you can imagine there is 10 minutes worth of faff as you decide what to do with your \"stuff\".... a couple of options.... take out a locker (located at the front) - they come in small, medium and large... you then can go backwards and forwards from it all day - the only thing is its a bit of a pain having to go back there throughout the day... we decided to leave valuables in the locker and find a suitable chair/bed to dump our stuff for the day (we left it for hours and no-one touched it)... I would only leave stuff that I wouldn't be 100% bothered if it was nicked (just in case)... That said many people were doing that!!.The second question is phones - Western problems!! I decided to leave it in the locker but you can buy these waterproof phone holders and take all the selfies and videos you want... my experience of waterproof and water is not great so I decided against it - that said many people were using them...The park itself has 2 \"scary ish\" rides 1) The Jumeriah Sceirah (screamer)2) Tantrum AlleyThe screamer was good - they build the tension up nicely and when you get into the pod at the top you are convinced you are on a one way ride to see Beelzebub... when the trapdoor goes and you drop the rush is immense... you fly down the slide at some speed and you may very well get a perfectly formed wedgy!!! Excellent fun!Tantrum Alley you are on a raft (up to 4 people) and the buzz goes from the height with which you climb and drop on the ascent - all good again....There are a couple of good flow rider things and lots of flying around on big tubes... Lunch time we expected to pay the equivalent of Afriaca's foreign debt for a sarnie but we were pleasantly surprised that it came to less than a tenner for both of us... imbetween rides we had some down time reading books and chilling... 7pm came along all too soon.... All in all well worth the money - would be just as good with kids - just remember they can only go on certain rides if they are of a certain height!!!"

Given the heat in Dubai it is also a good thing that a lot of the park is covered and yet there are plenty of areas for sun. The food available is also really good - my favorite is the pizza and the burger combo."

For variety we have been to Yas Water World(YWW), Atlantis Aquaventure(AA) and of course Wild Wadi (WW). Wild Wadi is smaller than Aquaventure but not too small. It is slightly older than the other two but this is pretty much where the cons end.The pros are many. 1st the car park is right next to the water park. No buses, no standing around in the heat with overtired children at the end of the day, you just walk out, get in your car and drive home. At YWW you have to carry the rubber rings for the rides up the stairs for every ride, at WW you just go up the stairs and they are waiting at the top for you. For me, great, free exercise, with young children this is a huge difference. The changing rooms could do with being a bit bigger and need an update but the lockers work and are plentiful enough. The queues are never too long even in peak season. WW has an excellent wristband system allowing you to put money and locker in one safe, waterproof place on your wrist meaning that you do not have to worry about wallets or money all day with it safe in your locker. As for the staff, well the WW staff deserve their own paragraph, they are awesome. Every single member from the supervisors to the managers to the attendants on every ride makes the children smile, laugh and goes out of their way to be helpful. They represent the group very well and help make a great day out greater. Every question is answered with a smile and directions and the little problems you have on any day out are solved quickly with thier help.My little girl just grew over the 1.1m petres for the first time this year and was so very excited as now she could go on every ride. Last year she got turned away at most rides and spent a lot of tie crying becuase her big brother got to do everything including going on the Jumeriah Scarer aged 4. However this time at each station she was measured until 1 hr before the end one lifeguard said we can give you a ristband to show you have been measured. WHY ON EARTH DIDN'T they do that at the entrance! All day the poor littel girl thought she would get denied. She got on every ride but each one seemed a close call, these things are huge to young children so please WW take note just give children close to the height limit a wristband on entry and save a lot of tears!The food is a touch on the expensive side for what you get but we were all full. It would be nice to be able to eat somewhere a little more cool, perhaps some outside ac units or fans wouldnt go amiss.Overall though, good rides, nice variety of excitement, enough room things to do but small enough to not be exhausting with young children. All in all a very nice family day out. I would firmly recommend it for family or friends, colleagues days out and will definitely be back with and without visitors to Dubai."

Its working time is up to sunset, so you should get there at the morning to have enough time for enjoying all sorts of entertainments.The park provides many water rides for both children and adults. The most exciting ride to me was the \"Burj Surj\" which I strongly recommend it.For eating you have to buy from local shops inside the park and you are not allowed to bring foods with you. There are 3 or 4 fast food restaurants inside the park but their prices are so expensive.Towel, shampoo, and all other necessaries could be found in local shop there but relative expensive. So its better to take all these with you."

Also there's a lifeguard at every corner which is a very comforting idea, especially if you're with children.The slides that go upwards are brilliant, especcially the part where you oversee the city as you fall down!Another thing this park has going for it is that children must be 1.10 m to be able to use all the slides. At the aquavertura park it's 1.20. For us (traveling with a 4 year old) this made all the difference in the world;)It's not cheap but its a guaranteed day full of fun!"

Wild Wadi is a must visit if you got Dubai, if you love water parks you would love this.The rides are extraordinary, nothing you have every seen before, 1 step in the park you could see water flowing and dancing around. The rides were very high quality and extremely phenomenal. Also if you are tired and need to rest you could lay down for a while with no-one disturbing you.The only thing I disliked about the park was the very expensive fast food shop, although the food was mouth watering and out of this world it was extremely expensive.

For adults, really only 4 rides are of interest. Staff are very pushy for up sales too. Photographers on most rides, snapping and sticking tags on your wrist. We handed up with half a dozen.

There are 3 what we would call big slides and then one that has over 11 interconnecting slides of varying degrees of speed as well as other more peaceful rides. It was really quiet when we visited in May (hot season apparently) but that was great for us we only queued for 10minutes for 1 ride the rest we were straight on.There are lifeguards everywhere as well as staff and they were all so friendly and helpful. You can take cameras/go pro on most of the slides just not the jumeriah scarah.If you are staying in a jumeriah hotel and get entry tickets included in your rate this includes a towel so no need to take your own. Lockers are chargeable and come in 3 sizes. Middle was fine for us for 2 rucksacks and was 50dirhams. The changing rooms are really clean, with plenty of lockers, changing rooms, showers and toilets. We stayed for around 3.5 hours and this was plenty of time to get on everything 2/3 times (albeit we didn't need to queue and we didn't stop for food).It really is a must do and if you need to pay for tickets they are well worth the price. Also there is a great view over Dubai especially the burj al Arab. "

We spent most of the day on and off the White Water Wadi and the Lazy River, to be honest.

There are two massive water parks in Dubai; Atlantis, which is situated in the grounds of the Atlantis Hotel over on the Palm which is quite a way out of the main areas of Dubai, and Wild Wadi, which is situated at the side of the Jumeriah Beach Hotel. Wild Wadi is the better park if you want crazy rides, more to do, and you are visiting with families. Be sure to contact the park in advance if you need to reserve a cabana or beach space.There are restrictions to what you can take into any of the parks in Dubai, specifically to avoid people taking in bags and bags of food. There are rules for a reason and much of this is to avoid rats and other unwanted guests which in this heat is unavoidable. They do everything they can however to keep things very clean, but some have failed respect the rules in the past and larger families taking in huge cold boxes of food and drink (including alcohol which is strictly prohibited in the park) have now been denied entry. There are places to get food there, but as with everything the park opens at 10am and starts to get really busy about 11am and manic around lunchtime so to ensure you aren't queuing and wasting time, make sure you get there early.You can understand when you see the dynamic at the park and the no alcohol thing is entirely practical and isn't simply because of restrictions in Dubai itself but rather because you really don't want to be consuming booze and then getting on these rides! Also, it is hot, and while you think you are safe because you're spending your time in the water, the sun is brutal. Drink plenty of water. Take a hat. You do dehydrate while you're at the park for sure. Between March and the end of May temperatures start to soar and you will get burned so take your sunscreen. There are lockers in the changing rooms in the park and close to the rides so safety of personal items aren't an issue.June through July is Ramadan, and whilst the park is open, the working hours are reduced. Also, June and July is extremely busy with vacationers from local areas like Saudi, Qatar, Pakistan etc taking their annual vacations through the Ramadan and Eid period (June / July this year) and the locals are much more used to the temperatures but even they know to take the proper precautions so they don't get burned.Open all year around (even Christmas Day!) and well worth a visit if you want to have fun, and you like water of course! Yes, its warm enough even at Christmas.... its actually very pleasant at that time of year - about 22-24 degrees usually.I prefer this park to Atlantis in that there is more to do, and the wave beach is a great place for the whole family, rather than the rides which are great if there are two of you. It isn't cheap, but then nothing is in Dubai, but they sure do ensure it is spotlessly clean and safe. TAKE YOUR FLIP-FLOPS if you are visiting in the Spring / summer months.... the floors get unbelievably hot and your feet will burn!Children under 3.5 feet aren't allowed on all the rides, so be sure to check when you book tickets to the park. There is a special area for the kids though with their own rides which is great for little ones under 3.5 feet tall! Don forget that sunscreen though!Great fun though for all the family!"

We went as a family with small children, and even our 5 year old was allowed on many rides as she was just above 1.1m tall. Before I get into the rides, the park is right next to Burj Al Arab, and Hotel Jumeirah on the other side. So you get lots of opportunities and angles to photograph those two beautiful buildings that normally you can't get close to(esp Burj Al Arab).There's a big wave pool and 13 different slides. Most of the slides, except for the tallest ones allow for at least 2 and sometimes 4 people to sit together in a tube, so the little ones won't be scared. There's a water playground for children smaller than 5. For anyone looking for an adrenaline rush, the Jumeiah Seirah is sure to satisfy. Not only is it a long fast ride down, but you get to sit in a capsule where the floor is pulled out from under you!The food is mostly fast food and you pay extra for towels if you don't bring them yourself, but that's about the only negatives I could come up with."

It feels very safe with lifeguards on every corner and they really seem to take their job seriously which gives a nice secure atmosphere. Beware of the waiting time for taxi's outside at the end of your trip and also don't be talked into a private taxi, which is a general rule for Dubai anyway.

My teen aged kids and I had a great 4 hours here mid week when the crowds were small, the heat was not too bad and the lines were virtually non existent. The electronic cash wrist bands work well, and lockers are available for storing clothes and valuables. The place is very clean and very well supervised. No hoons here. The rides are great fun. Favourites were the Jumeirah Sceirah & the Wipeout Flowrider (aptly named...). The surfaces are well padded and are non slip when walking, though can get quite hot so keep some footwear with you. Towels can be hired and there are plenty of fast food options. My main gripe was around our 3 towels being inundated by a 'flood' which occurs periodically just by the waiting area for Wipeout Flowrider. We did not know this was coming. Luckily my camera was off the ground at the time. We took our soaked towels back to get them replaced but were told we would have to hire 3 new ones. That was a bit rich, especially when it is no cheap exercise to take a family along at around 280 Dirham's each (about AUD$90 per person) before hiring towels & lockers."

I must say its continuosly improving after their renovation. One thing to keep in mind though is not to come too early nor in the middle of the day, especially now that summer is almost here, we arrive there at 3pm til 7pm and its more than enough time to cover all rides & we even did few rounds with some we like the best. If u want to save a few dirhams u could also bring your own towel, instead of renting, and if u want to avoid long que come on weekdays or even Saturday afternoon. They allow you to bring a small bottle of water only, but food is not so expensive and have lots of options as well like burgers, hotdogs, fruits and complete snack bar. Though its always advisable to eat before entering as with all the fun rides, you will not have much of an appetite with all the twists and turns. Great place for all ages, especially during the hot weather!!"

Queues can be long depending on time of day as well but so far we have not had to wait more than a few minutes. Make sure you have cover like a rash vest as it can get very hot.

Bit of a faff actually getting in and takes a while to pay and get the wrist band sorted, but once in it is easy to get around. The best rides are Burj Surge and Tantrum Alley, both inflatable rides but really cool. Jumeirah Screamer was also great, standing in the pod and listening to the count down is nerve wracking and when the floor goes, woof, you bomb down the tube and it feels like you're going down a giant loo. Kids area is great, and wave pool really good too. Food is usual junk and overpriced, why can't places like this offer healthier, more varied cuisine which is less about making money and more about being good for you?Fisho is a great side line and worth it for the experience, our 5 yr old loved it.So, if you're looking for a good day out (but not the best food) with some cool slides and a lot of fun, Wild Wadi is worth a shot.UAE residents get in for 195 dirhams if you show your card so make sure you ask for this if you are a resident. But you can't do this in conjunction with an entertainer two for one voucher."

They of course loved it. There are signs that mark intensity levels.I thought the place was clean, a ton of lifeguards, pizza was good, and overall is was a fun day.

The rides were great fun, although the park felt much smaller and more compact compare to the Atlantis waterpark which we also visited a couple of days earlier. The staff were really friendly and there were plenty of lifeguards who seemed to take their job seriously which is always reassuring. The food was great - we had chicken kebabs for lunch and everything was really reasonably priced and great quality for an attraction like this. Take advantage of the cashless system - it is well worth it for hassle free eating. The rides were great fun but if you are on your own there is less to do as a solo rider than Atlantis waterpark (I wanted to sunbathe but my boyfriend needed a play mate on most of the rides), the lazy river isn't as good as Atlantis, but zooming uphill on your rubber ring on their rapids was brilliant. Overall, would recommend but if you have to choose just one waterpark I would go to Atlantis."

Also see https://www.theentertainerme.com/Dubai-N-Emirates/products/print/Entertainer-Dubai-2015The park has lots of rides of different intensities. The 'lazy' river is great fun and is more like a ride combined with a lazy river. Plenty of seats and beds. When we were there in October there was a lot of sun beds. However in the Easter holidays these seem to have been replaced with lounger seats (probably due to more people in the park). There was still loads of seats/beds to go around - just have a good walk round the whole park and not just at the main wave pool area.Food is standard waterpark fast food. Not the cheapest but does the job. Lockers can be rented there. You can fit a normal sized backpack in the small locker. Towels can be rented at a cost so bring your own if you can."

(If considering a visit to Dubai with kids, that is a real plus to staying at one of the Madinat hotels, particularly when they will transport you over by golf cart.)The water slides were great and interestingly enough when compared to waterparks in the US, it's nice to see a crowd where everyone over the age of 17 doesn't have a tattoo!If this was a waterpark in the US, I would feel completely robbed by the 24 USD cost for three orders of fires and three sodas. But, it is Dubai and well, it's part of the deal.We stayed in Dubai for a few day stay before heading off to another part of Asia. For our kids, this was a great way to enjoy the sun after a long winter in the US."

We got on almost every ride approximately 3-4 times each within the first 2hrs before it got really packed!!!! Grab a seat by the wave pool and your pretty much in the middle of the park. They have a system there for your locker and food on a wrist band and any money you don't spend they refund it back to you which is super cool. They also accept American express card so save your AED money.. The park food well jus like any other amusement park its just basic food lol. Bring you own towel from the hotel and save yourself money for renting. Have a good time we would go back in a heartbeat!"

The toilets and changing rooms were clean as they were constantly serviced by attendants. According to my little ones, this was the highlight of their vacation in Dubai. The entrance fee of AED 275 ( approx \u00a350 ) for anyone over 1.1m (which was all of us) was a tad steep. There was also a charge of either AED 55 or 65 ( between \u00a310 - \u00a312) for a medium-sized locker. Food outlets were conveniently darted around the park and guests are not allowed to bring in food from outside. We settled for the beef pizza and drink combo, which was so divine and had a price tag of AED 60 each ( approx \u00a312). Children and young-at-heart adults would definitely have a memorable time at this water park!"

We were in residence at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel and entry to the park was free. So my advice if you are staying in any of the Jumeirah properties and are able to gain complimentary access you would be crazy to waste this opportunity. The prices for the park are quite expensive.We arrived just after opening time and set our towels down on a nice location and hit the rides! The park was not crazy busy to begin with and we rode everything we could.If you are first time visitor to the park this is not like Disney World in Orlando where you are worried that you will miss something if you don't keep moving. This park is relatively small compared to what we are used to back in the USA. A good 3 or 4 hours visit you will be able to get to ride all the rides and several of them more than once!When we broke for lunch we found reasonably priced and a great variety of food available in several different locations.We rested some in the mild afternoon sun and found the whole day to be very enjoyable. One of the party was in their late 60's and in delicate health and was still able to ride some of the rides which we found safe and secure for them!One of the nice things about this park is that you don't need to bring money with you, on entry you are given a wrist band and you add money to this wristband by charging to your hotel room (or credit card if you are not staying at a Jumeirah property) which allows you to purchase food and items from the gift store by having the wristband scanned! Makes visiting the park easier because you don't need to bring valuables with you.Overall a great experience and worth a visit."

We were originally planning to go to Aquaventure at Atlantis but decided on Wild Wadi instead because kids over 1.1m are allowed on all the rides (lower height restriction than at Atlantis). We all had a great time and the kids had a blast! The kids' play area was amazing and suitable for kids of any ages - the adults had a lot of fun here too! The wave pool was also a big hit with the kids and we had a lovely day out.The wristband which functions as your ticket can be pre-loaded with money which can be redeemed at the restaurants around the park, which means you don't have to carry any money around with you while you are there. Any money leftover at the end of the day can be refunded in full at the gift shop. I've been to Aquaventure as well and while I would say that is a better option for adults and bigger kids, I would definitely recommend Wild Wadi for families with young children."

            "review": "Absolute madness and poorly run facility. Wild Wadi used to be the uber attraction in Dubai. Now its unfortunately old, and poorly managed waterpark with hordes of people that its a let down.It all begins from the ticket line. One immediately witness the chaos with all the tourist buses pulling up. The attendants ushering people into lines do their best, however the process of getting tickets for one family can take as much as 10 minutes per family. So imagine if you have 3 families ahead of you. They should have more counters and have better options such as ticket kiosks etc for single people or just adults so they can whiz by. Trust me this adds such frustration before even entering the park and let me remind you that you are waiting outside an unshaded pavement with a few fans blowing hot air and being Dubai it can get sweltering hot during the summer.Then once you clear the lines you get into the locker and changing rooms and besides a couple of cleaners there was no attendant to guide or help people figure out how to use the lockers. The poor cleaners who i will add early on were the best behaved a d friendliest staff in the entire park. I guess WW management do not study their demographic, im sure 80% of the people are either tourists or first timers. So they should have a few attendants. Only a couple of posters which didn't do a good job explaining. Then quickly moving along..qe went to the kids splash area. It was a weekday and early afternoon and there were no sun loungers available. No one manages them. So people throw their belongings or leave a say plastic bag and assumption is that the chair is taken. Some even hijack more chairs than needed. No one is managing this, no towel boys hence no one knows which chair is occupied and which is not. This was the worst part of the park. Besides life guards i did not see any management personnel on the grounds to run the show. Utter chaos and horribly democraticly run establishment. Lo and behold then we wanted to get pizza from the pizza restaurant. And after waiting 25 minutes just to place the order the lady informed us that it would take another 30 minutes to get the food. People were irate as food was taking long. I mean are you kidding me. They shoulf know better and prep and staff accordingly as they probably go through this daily. Lastly the water was horribly salty and warm that you dont enjoy it at all. By the time u are out of the water my eyes were burning and itching due to the salt content in the water and it was dirty. I saw bandages and ice cream sticks floating in the water.And the last straw was that when i went to retrieve my contents from my locker the wrist thing was not working. I informed 2 cleaners, as again there were no attendants and they went to get security. I waited for 15 minutes and still no one showed up. Then a gentleman named Mubeen who looked like management happened to walk in to use the facility and i stopped him and he left to get security. Before he could return my wrist band worked and unlocked the locker and by this time Mubeen showed up with security. I was grateful for that ut imagine waiting 15 minutes for just somebody to come and help you open the locker.Overall a beautiful park with great rides, great views and location, however it is poorly run and can be extremely frustrating that the joy soon turns to anger. Good for 1 time but will never ever go there again. Yas water park is 10 times better in Abu Dhabi or Aquaventure in Atlantis. Less rides at aquaventure but ur spoiled by the attentive staff there. Wild wadi had seen better days. What a shame."

Our group consisted of children and adults, who all found pools and rides to enjoy. There are many lifeguards on duty and they ensure safety at all times. The resort map also clearly shows which rides are suitable for children and for the adults how 'intense' the rides are. On the day we visited there was a sandstorm which I assume stopped some people visiting because the park never felt very busy all day. There were plenty of sunbeds and chairs available but on a nicer day I would recommend arriving when it first opens at 10am. We only queued for 5 minutes at 10.30am and the staff were helpful and well organised. We also paid extra for the Cabana, which is expensive but provided a great private area for our group. Each cabana has a shaded area with 4 sun loungers plus a table with 4 chairs. The price also included our own fridge stocked with a large variety of soft drinks and water. We also had a food menu so we could order our food and have it delivered to our cabana (food at an extra cost). Only 1 ride was closed in the afternoon due to the sand so we managed to experience all of the rides and we didn't get burn't from too much sun! I would suggest wearing high factor sun protection when you are in the water park. Overall a great family day out."

It's not as big as Atlantis but imo has a better selection of activities for those with young children, as we do. Wild Wadi is located in between the Jumeirah Beach hotel and the Burj Al Arab. Best to travel there by taxi if you don't have other means of transportation. If you're a large family I'd advise getting hold of the Entertainer vouchers as you'll save yourself quite a bit of money. Remember you have to pay for all extras like towels, lockers. There are 3 different locker sizes. We had a pushchair and the big locker was able to fit that plus a small bag. There are several food outlets dotted around the park, each serving something slightly different. The food is pricey though, and if like my kids they don't have much of an appetite I'd recommend getting a pizza to share. We went on a Monday and got there for about 12. The queues weren't particularly long and you should be able to get through all the rides at least once in 4 hours. On the whole the staff were pleasant although there was one that gave us the run around trying to find the entrance to the lazy river ride."

Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice parc, but slides are not as long and extreme as somewhere else.

In my view Wild Wadi wins. It is the complete package ........... and much easier to access. Go early to get the best locations/seating and it is usually better to book online (and if you are a large party consider paying the bit extra for the limited availability pagoda stations). Also there are many ways to reduce the entry costs (vouchers at hotels, Entertainer guide voucher, Sirius membership etc) so you never have to pay the full cost. Also bring things like towels with you and some food .... to reduce costs further. I am sure you will have a marvelous dayIf you are a guest of one of the Jumeirah hotel, this experience is free."

Good value day out if you use Entertainer vouchers, food on site is good but a bit pricey. Get a medium locker if you are more than a couple. There are also lockers around the site, which you don't realise until you are in. Some on the rides don't link well, so you end up walking a longer distance to where you want to go.

It was adjacent to the Al Qasr and a free buggy ride took us to the Park - no problem getting in, apart from the check on our bags for foodstuffs (bottled water was allowed) so do not try to bring in your picnic! The Water Park is not huge, but offers a very large swimming pool and water attractions for the children (they looked extremely popular). With no children there is still plenty to do, we took several rides on the water slides - great fun and not too frightening for a couple of cowards. The food was standard stuff and not too expensive, but it could add to the cost of the day out for large families. Definitely worth a visit, but do not go there expecting the best Water Park in the world - it's good but not great. An enjoyable day out is enhanced by the wonderful weather - not really to be missed, but do not underestimate the cost if you are a large family (entrance, food, drinks and lockers)."

Me and my partner visited Wild Wadi on one of our days in Dubai and it was a great experience.I wasn't expecting the park to be as big as it was but it was a very good size park with great facilities. As we visited on a Thursday I think that's the reason it was quieter but if possible visit on a weekday as you won't have to queue for rides. We never queued once for any ride!The prices were very reasonable for all extras and the place was extremely clean!TIP: Load your wristband up to save you time and hassle as you will get a refund on any money you don't spend.Take towels and/or a beach bag with a change of clothes in. You will want to keep everything in a locker as you have your wristband to pay for items and you can enjoy the whole day without worrying about your stuff."

But definitely aim to visit both.Wild Wadi has fewer group rides, but does have two amazing features. The vertical drop ride will max-out your adrenaline levels, and the waterslides that push you up hill make for a memorable experience.Advice: Aquaventure, for me, is the better park but I recommend both and personally alternate between them both."

We had a really good day - it was really quiet so we didn't have to que for the rides! Bonus! It was quite expensive for two people plus the cost of a locker I think it was \u00a393 but we enjoyed the day. Our favourite ride was the Tantrum alley, you can have up to 4 people but we only had 2 and it was so fast/fun! My boyfriend went on the jumeirah sceirah and said it was scary!! You basically drop down through a trap door onto the slide. Overall a good place to go for the day, I probably wouldn't return but only because we've now done it. :-)"

Our 4 year old daughter loved the wave pool and the slides aimed at juniors / inexperienced swimmers. However my 23 year old niece and I also had lots of fun on the faster white knuckle type rides aimed at older children and adults.The place was spotlessly clean with lots of staff on hand to answer any questions etc. Granred, the souvenirs and photographs and refreshments are not cheap - but hey, with free admission, we cannot moan.Great fun, completely worn our little girl out, as soon as we got back to the room her head hit the pillow, but just before she went to sleep, she asked me........ \"Can we go back to the Water Park again tomorrow Daddy\"........Anyone on holiday with kids give this place a try, you'll have a great time."

There are really only two slides that are exceptionally intriguing - the high paced Jumeira Sceira, and a fast and wild one next to the Burj Surge whose name eludes me. There are some innovative rides on site (the aforementioned Sceira and the reverse 'slides' that get you around the park) and the staff are very friendly. It's worth it to entertain the kids, but there aren't really enough thrilling attractions to make it worth the price for adults."

Their water slides went up and down and I ended up getting really nauseous from getting turned around backwards. The lazy river was also not so lazy, but filled with men tipping over each others' tubes. I do have to say that once I got some water and took a break, the rest of the afternoon was awesome. We went on the Jumeirah Sceriah and Tantrum Alley multiple times. We both enjoyed ourselves overall, and had a good time cooling off from the Dubai heat.

For Americans, like me, who are used to mega-amusement parks, this one may not have as large a variety of rides and concessions as we're used to. However, I found the lines to be shorter than in the US. There was an unexpected glitch in our schedule: On the day of our visit, the park closed surprisingly early and our hotel shuttle wasn't aware of that. A ladies' night was being held, and we were barely tolerated by the staff at the entrance as we waited a long time for our bus (I can understand that a bunch of men hanging around the entrance was not what management hoped for on ladies night).. An unexpected treat was the view of the Burj Al Arab next door. We saw helicopters land on the heliport near its summit. The views of the beach, sea and Burj Al Arab are very nice and there is a deck where you can relax and enjoy it."

Not many slides,just 3! When we went out it was a long line waiting for taxi and no taxi!Won't go again,even free. It was 65$ while in iran very better than it with more slides is 4$!"

If you have kids this is a great place for them. They will be entertained. The theme to the park will be a hit with them as well.Like Disney and other places in the world, the food inside the park can be expensive and the water park is pricey overall. However, you get a real good value for what you pay. The park is clean, the water feels fresh, and the view can be good too. I was staying at Jumeirah so access to the waterpark was easy. Jumeriah Sceirah was my favorite 'fast slide' but the younger ones loved the Breaker's wave pool. This place is worth your visit."

We spent a day at Wild Wadi during February half term with our 3 children aged 14, 11 and 11 and another family who we had met at our hotel who had been before who had a 12 year old. We had an amazing day, the kids were occupied from 10-4 and to be honest we could've stayed longer. The queues for the rides do get longer as the day goes on so it is a good idea to get there early. The park is kept immaculately clean and the food and beverages are good value. Even if you don't like fast rides the lazy river is so relaxing and there were plenty of sunloungers so you could just spend the day soaking up the sun with your feet splashing in the lagoon. Our hotel was on the palm so the Atlantis waterpark was our closest option but I'm so glad we choose Wild Wadi, we would definitely return."

There was a long queue, but it was worth the wait. Basically, you stand inside what looks like an air-lock from a space ship, the floor beneath you drops and you go shooting down at supersonic speed! I only downside is that as you go down, water goes into your eyes and mouth, so you can't see or breath, but it doesn't last that long so (hopefully) you'll survive.Me and my family had a great time at this water park and I would be delighted to go again."

Having had an awful experience on the old Jumeirah Sceirah I was not convinced I wanted to try this time, however having been co-coerced by a 12 year old I gave it a go. Not for the claustrophobic as they shut you in a tube and then the floor comes out beneath you! A must for an adrenalin junkie but not for the faint hearted. The food prices are extortionate but its a captured market! A great day out for kids and big kids alike!"

But lots of lazy rides available, and if you like wake boarding there is several wake boarding areas there.The restaurants tends to get very busy so be prepared to wait, and be sure not to for get your sun screen.Advisable to go later in the day or at the opening time, mid day sun tends to drain you out, and the place can get very humid around the mid afternoon time.Before summer, up to april to mid May is maybe the best time to go.A lovely family day out to have if planned right."

We opted to go here rather than the Atlantis water park after seeing the negative reviews about waiting 1hr for a cab from the park to their hotel. The park itself is very clean and the rides they had were fun, the master blaster which is like a lazy river yet has \"master blasters\" which jet water underneath your inflatable ring and propel you upwards so it's great fun and lasts about 10min as it is 12 separate blasters connected. They had three other good rides in my opinion and that was it, the wave rider was shut and the wave pool was not good at all. I was disappointed that you were not allowed onto the beach so we ended up leaving at 3pm as we had done all the good rides to death. When leaving there was a queue of 50 people waiting to get a cab (which is normal at Dubai mall etc) yet at this water park they have not arranged for any taxis to pick up so we waited in line for 20min and only 3 taxi's arrived at the rank. I asked a staff member if there was a station nearby and he said there was one 10min walk away so we opted for that yet it actually took 30min to get there (3km distance I later worked out). The staff were very friendly yet next time I shall be going to the Atlantis hotel water park instead and take the monorail back to the city."

This worked out well because my daughter was only 3 months old, and we had a shaded place for her. The cabana also came with a fridge of complimentary drinks. We also had our own entrance to. The lazy river. We were escorted to the cabana from the front entrance. The Waterpark itself is very nice. A good section for young kids as well as all the big, thrill slides. Although it was an expensive day, it was quite enjoyable. We would definitely come back to Wild Wadi. "

However, there was one slide very different to anything I'd experienced called the White Water Wadi ride. It is split into several sections (so make sure you get on it at the beginning) and you can either go in your own tube or with someone else in a double tube and it is like being on a roller coaster as it propels you up the slide before whizzing you round the chutes. I couldn't stop laughing the whole way round.Entrance, locker, food and photos are all expensive but having said that, the food was cooked fresh (we had a BBQ) and there were plenty of lifeguards about. More showers need to be installed (a school trip happened to be leaving the same time and took up the whole changing area)."

If you are touring Dubai with friends, then this should be a must do activity.Great fun not so crowded, wait time was maximum 15 min for some rides... staff were friendly.All the rides and slides were great, especially Jumeirah Sceirah & burj surj. Heavy discount if you have people with UAE resident cards in your group. Their wave pool is one of the best i've visited. Overall a best place to spend half a day with friends.General Tip:1. Carry your own swim wear, they do sell but at very high price.2. Also get water proof pouches for your phones from outside if you are going to snap pictures, i had to pay 120 AED just for the cover in the park."

It is as good if not better, than Aquaventure and this was perhaps because it was less busy. The parks are very similar, with Lazy River rides through to white knuckle rides, but Wild Wadi felt more compact and the maximum queue time for the \"top\" rides was only 15 mins. The food courts and gift shops were reasonably priced and we got the daily deal on ticket prices which included a towel, locker and shower gel etc. All in all a really great day. The one issue was the lack of taxis when the park closed. We were waiting an hour and a half before the staff tried to sort it out. No taxis were available so Wild Wadi provided a coach to take people to the Mall of the Emirates where there were taxis available. Made the journey home very long and tedious."

It also acts as the key for the locker.Definitely worth a visit."

The queues are relatively short and the lifeguards are friendly with a sense of humour. I did't get a chance to have a go at the surfing wave but I appreciated the variety of rides Wild Wadi has to offer and the rapids travel almost the whole perimeter of the park. One of the rides makes your heart miss a beat when it swivels out over the main road where the cars are passing by, but great fun all the same. Its definitely worth spending one of your days here to keep cool while having great fun at the same time. Well recommended!"

And we were staying closer.My boy did every ride he was allowed to ride on (and one he wasn't allowed on lol) and had a ball. We got there at 11am and got in quick, we got a locker, and 10 minutes later we were in the first of many fun moments of the day. I could see why it wouldn't be so great for older children/Tweens/teens, but at this age there was enough variety to create some great memories. We chose a couple of digital photos as well, not cheap, but I expected to pay.We only has two downsides; the wait for a taxi was 45 minutes at 4pm, even though there was an option for a free bus to MOE, which cut the taxi queue a little. Second was the hot food available. A disgrace. 15 minutes to queue to order and a 25 minute wait for crap, but it was kind of expected.Apart from those two downsides a great day for me and my son, which he is still talking about.

I am super impressed with the lifeguards around the park, they are vigilant and friendly. On two occasions. I saw two lifeguards jump in to help children. In one instance, the parents were too busy taking photos and were not watching their children. A small infant toppled over the life guard did not hesitate to jump in from afar and help the baby. They talked to this same couple several times to watch their infant and pleaded with them to keep a close eye on the infant. The only reason I am not giving this park a 5 out of 5 is the lack of bathrooms. We had to walk a long way from the wave pool to use the rest room and I also saw several people wearing inappropriate swimwear for the pool. 10 year old in street clothes and adults in jeans. This could be a great facility if they sharpened up on attire."

It is also true that there are lifeguards everywhere so it is pretty safe. Although the guy we saw with a giant bruise on his chest and chin plus bleeding from the mouth would probably disagree. We don't know what happened but parks always have some danger to them. When you get out of the water you get really cold quickly and there are like 5 changing rooms for a zillion people. There is a dryer cabin which would have been fantastic if it wouldn't have been out of order. A locker will set you back 35 AED and it's 250 AED per person to get in. We got in for free as we stayed in the Dar Al Masyaf but still had to pay for the locker. My wife said only one toilet was working so a long wait to finally have some relief. The rides are great but the experience on a whole was pretty simular to other parks, expensive, long waits, numb staff and no comfort."

When we arrived we walked up to the counter and asked for a discount as we are UAE residents (show your Emirates ID) and we were promptly given a cheaper rate as well as tickets for lunch. Great start.This really is somewhere that you can go and have fun with friends, family or even a couple looking to do something different. On the day that I went the lines were short and we could keep going until we were tired. This ended up being a whole day visit.To make the most of Wild Wadi, I really suggest having a Go-Pro/Underwater case for your smart phone because there is lots of fun to be had having this too.Great fun and remember - locals get a discount."

But because this is a complimentary to the hotel stay, otherwise the entrance fees may be a bit towards the steep side.The park provides a watch like band as an entry proof where you could pre-stored money value for locker and food/drinks. The locker was small, so travel light or without valuables unless you have someone seated there to look after. The food was simple comfort food. However it was disappointing to know that when my 8-year old asked for an extra serving of the sauce for his food, he was told that he needed to pay extra 2 dirham, though not much but this was unexpected.A few life guards were unfriendly. But there were helpful ones too, eg at the surfing of wave station and the scary twin slides. Other than these this park is a must go when you go visit Dubai."

We went as soon as it was open so there were not many people at all. I booked the private cabana for AED 1500. Not sure if it was money well spent though. We enjoyed just being able to hop up from the river directly to our cabana for a rest between rides. However the park was relatively quiet throughout the day so we didn't really benefit from the fast pass to the White Water Wadi rides which was one of the main reason we paid for the cabana. Apparently the soft drinks in the fridge were also included which we only found out when we checked out of the cabana. As to the rides, all are fun and as expected in a water park. What I found most amusing was that Burj Al Arab often popped into my view while I was twisted and turned in the water rides. A very funny way to \"enjoy\" the view of the landmark!I was also very touched when a passing by staff asked if I was alright when I was feeling sick after doing so many rides (after a big breakfast). It was nice to see caring staff in the park.The river connecting the rides were flowing rather slowly (a bit boring) so most of the people got off the tube and just walked or swam.The good thing is there are so many tubes available at the beginning points of the rides so you don't have to carry the tube yourself, unlike Aquaventure at Atlantis where you have to carry the tube with you to do most of the rides."

As the park map propagated the staff consisted of some 34 nationalities, and every one of them that we encountered were polite and helpful. We got stuck during the ride on Master Blasters and the lifeguard was very comforting and nice in helping us out from the slide. Jumeirah Sceirah was the star ride and there was a queue going up five floors, but the wait was well worth it. Food was average with not much choice but that\u2019s how it is in most parks.

I imagine that if the place is packed getting on a ride would be chaos as in fact there are only 3/4 rides which are really any good. There are two pointless surf based rides, which were awful and then the main pool area which apart from a wave machine had no other attraction. The Jumeriah Scarer (excuse the spelling) was great but will not be to everyone's liking and the water ring based rides were ok but not brilliant. As I say after some of the feedback I had before visiting, I was very underwhelmed for the price and I won't be visiting again."

The band can be topped up throughout the day and if you have a balance left by the time you are done the outstanding money is returned to you, this makes the day nice and easy as you arent running back to your locker all the time. They also sell a water proof casing in their shop for mobile phones. This item was fantastic, it allows you to record your park adventure. I was a little nervous of this but it didnt leak. We even went on ro use the case in the sea while snorkling! The staff were very friendly offering to take pictures at the top of rides etc.The rides here were great I would suggest a visit to the park if anyone gets the chance.My husband and I used a 2-4-1 voucher from the Dubai entertainment book, so the cost of the day was more than reasonable.

It's a clean park, food is quite pricey, it's a nice outing and if you have kids, they'll love it!"

I would recommend going earlier in the week, as it gets very busy the nearer the weekend gets.

My husband and I bought the entertainer voucher book in Dubai and used the voucher to buy one entrance get one free, allowing for a break on the price which was a great start. We went later in the afternoon, leaving ourselves about 4 hours to hit all the rides. This was the second best decision we made that day! Many people had already left for the day, leaving very minimal lines. We were able to ride every ride, some twice! The park is well organized, and labeled. We loved the idea of the bracelets so you don't have to carry money around with you or a key to the lcoker. We experienced the Dr. Fish treatment on our feet and loved it! The rides were great, a really good variety of comfortable to a little scary.. like being enclosed in a tube where the floor drops out and you go straight down a huge slide. Crazy, but fun.. even for people in their late 20s!"

We took a 6 year old, 8 year old and a 12 year old and although we accompanied to two younger one most rides they still were able to go on the scary rides tantrum alley or something like that.

My Wife, Daughter and I visited the Wild Wadi Water park in October.The park claims to have over 40 rides but in reality it's only around 10 or 11, with some rides having a number of options...such as the water slides, which is in one big area with about 5-6 different slides. This is more for kids. There are 4-5 different rides for kids under 1.10 meter tall and 11 or so in total.Kids will have a great time and our daughter who is not 1.10meters tall stayed on the slides most of the time. We also went on the 2 lazy rivers and their is a wave pool which generates waves every 30 minutes of so for about 15 mins. The adult rides are faster and good fun, such as the water ski boards, and the faster rides down the lager shoot and slopes. The queues we not very long and we didn't have to wait more than 10 mins for any ride. This was a Tuesday, however as long as you don't go on a Friday or Saturday(The weekend in UAE), it shouldn't be too busy.The price for the park however is 295 Dhirams for adults and 235 for children which is roughly \u00a350 for adults and \u00a340 for children. Note children is classes as anyone under 1.10 meters tall..after that you pay the full price, however they can then go on all the rides. The admission prices as you see are fairly steep, however we had Entertainer vouchers and got a 2 for 1 for adults and managed to find someone to do the same for my daughter, which meant it cost us \u00a370 for the 3 of us as opposed to \u00a3140.The park is well laid out and you can do as much or as little as you want. There are lockers available to store your belongings, bags etc, and they vary in price depending on the size of the locker.I would recommend this park if you want a day to just have fun and relax at the same time. There are lots of deck chairs, but you may have to search for one if you come in late as they get snapped up quickly. Their are ample eating places however service is slow, and the food is not great, burgers, chips, wraps, pastas, and such are made to order but it takes 20 mins for anything to be ready for you. This is not table service, just fast food outlets..but none are very fast, and they don't all sell what they say on their boards. If you can, your better off bringing your own picnic.Overall a great day out for both us and our daughter and definitely worth doing with an entertainer 2 for 1 voucher, and probably worth bringing a Picnic. One thing to note when we left the park at around 6pm their was not a single taxi in sight, and a large queue waiting for one. If you don't have your own transport your best bet is to walk out and take a right turn, walking towards the Burj Al Arab...probably 8-10 min walk, where you will find ample taxis to get you back home."

Locker rooms, toilets and showers are dated like the all area. Just keep your flip flops all the time - there are places where you can leave them while you have a ride, as you can't were any shoes (except swimming shoes) when riding. The area needs refurbishment and in my understanding it's going to be closed from January 2015 for a couple of months for maintenance. We took the capsule ride Jumeirah Sceirah at first, so after that everything was easy. This park is more for the children than adults. If you are family with children and have only one option, I'd suggest the Atlantis, as there is everything for everybody."

The entrance is very expensive (295 dirhams/person) and not worth it! Good that we had the Entertainer voucher. I was there with my boyfriend and if we were there for a whole day we would deffinitely get bored. Btw not all the tobogans were working and neither the bathrooms were maintained. I have visited much better water parks in Greece and Spain, Wild wadi was nothing in comparison. The only nice thing was that you are pushing up by the water on some attractions, that was something new for me."

My wife and i especially enjoyed the 2 surfing rides and the rollercoasters sending you to the top of the slides. The staff are very attentive in their coaching (on the surfing rides) and the communal pool was superior to Aqua's too. The only downside was the amount of pictures the staff insisted taking off you and the vastly inflated prices of the photographs. To day out!"

And this alone speaks for itself. The 48,000 sqm water parks offers 30 different rides and attractions. Despite having opened in 1999, the management very efficiently maintains and re-introduces new attractions to the park so that after 15 years of operation it still looks brand new. The park offers something for all age groups and all bravery stages, from \"scared sea turtle\" to \"bring it on I'm a shark\". One highlight of this park is its proximity to the Burj Al Arab hotel, which visitors can see from various areas. The lazy river is intelligently planned into the development, allowing guests to use its water streams to be carried form attraction to attraction, which makes for a lazy alternative than walking. F&B at the park is sufficient, however lacks healthy options - fast food it is for the day (as you are not allowed to bring in your own drinks or eatery - bag check at entrance!).Tip: if you are staying in either the Burj Al Arab, Jumeirah Beach Hotel or in either of the Madinat Jumeirah properties, your entry fee is waved (even with only one night stay). Something that is worth considering as the entry for 2 people ramps up to about AED 550 / USD 150."

The Entertainer vouchers made this a good value for money day out at around \u00a3100 for 4 (I probably wouldn't feel the same paying full price). Lunch was the typical burger and chip type Fayre but it was very well done and considering the large portion size and inclusive ice cream and fanta I thought around \u00a310 was an OK price to pay. (Smaller children could share 1 between 2.). Getting a return taxi was a bit of a nightmare so the complimentary bus to the Mall of the Emirates was really welcomed.

Entrance and lockers expensive enough but there is no limit on how long you can stay inside. The water park is set below the Burj Al Arab 7 star Hotel on one side and the Jumeirah Hotel on the other so a nice backdrop all round. The rides are varied and some tame but others not for the faint hearted. The Jumeirah Sceirah was well worth the long walk up the stairs when your stood in a coffin shaped enclosure and dropped vertically. Its over quickly but still worth it. Remember not to bring your footwear to any rides with you as you cannot wear them on the rides. It can be a long walk back up for them.My other favourite was the Tantrum Alley. It was not too short and had a lot of changes and different parts to it so well worth it. Best place to lie down in is the raised platform on the Burj Al Arab side of the park as it is away from the stream of people walking around and has a perfect view of the hotel and beach in front.It wouldn't be something I would go to twice if on holidays but it is well worth experiencing."

Not a major issue as it was good to have a rest but it was getting a little heated with a few complaints from guests.There was a bit of a queue to get into the park at about 10.15 so I'd recommend ordering online before setting off as these people walked straight through.There are loads of photographers around the park taking official photos. These cost 100dhs or around \u00a315 each at the end of the day. However, they offered us every picture for 325dhs on a memory stick so we stored the ones we had taken so far and went back around the park until we had about 40 pictures. They then worked out at less than \u00a31.50 each. We got a 10% discount and 3 free prints thrown in to make the deal even sweeter.The staff around the park were superb, really friendly and helpful.We got sunbeds no problem and we didn't hear anyone complaining.The rides were all good with the longest queue about 20mins for the main drop slide.

However the food is very reasonable within which is a surprise for a water park especially within Dubai, a large pizza with a salad, ice cream and large drink was 70dirham. There so plenty of food variety, a good day for all. Lots of fun"

However, if you don't like riding the very same slides over and over again you might get bored. It's way smaller than you might think it is, for the way it is marketed. Also the entrance fee is really high and the food is expensive and not the best. However, they have a few rides that make the experience worth, especially the super-tall slide and the four-people slide - at least for me personally. Also the surf-machine is a nice feature. Besides these, there are also some slides for kids and a wave pool. The haunting house is pretty good, yet I wouldn't go there twice."

Kids were happy by hotel pool BUT our hotel Emirates towers inc a free day pass to Wild Wadi so we persuaded our 8,10,12 & 14 year old to go for the day..... Little did they know how much fun they would have! We arrived just before opening and had rang ahead to book a cabana 1500dhs which is about \u00a3250 but because we saved 300dhs per person on the entrance it was well worth it. The cabana inc a fidge filled with soft drinks and a small platter of water melon later in the day. We also got queue busting to some of the slides.The park itself is big appeared extremely well run and had over kill on life guards both in and out of the water. This I liked and because my children are all confident swimmers and I felt the park was well supervised I sat and read a book whilst the kids had a wonderful time trying out all the slides, popping back intermittently for food or water.The food menu was basic, burger chip style, but was relatively cheap for an attraction such as this.It's definately worth taking a sun uv protection top as it did get hot around mid day. We had a great day overall and will definately visit again and would definately recommend for all ages."

Masses of lifeguards so you feel safe and sound and all the staff were friendly and cheeful with the exception of the female at the turnstyle on the hotel side, who was rude, brusque and gave us zero eye contact, no excuses of a long hard day as we were the first customers of the morning, I did make a note of her name but I don't think it's fair to name and shame, sad that one individual can let her whole team down.

As we were guests at a Jumeirah hotel our access was free and I can appreciate the comments that it is overpriced for those that have paid. I expect that there are discounts about like we have in the UK for Alton Towers, no one goes without a half price voucher.There is plenty of room and lots of places for snacks albeit they are not the greatest of quality and pretty standard fast food junk.We enjoyed a couple of hours as it was very quiet and no queues- it was also extremely hot so beware !"

On our visit the systems crashed and it took a long time and a lot of complaining to get our money back and leave.That apart, we had a great day but I must say that the park was not very busy so I don't know what the queues would be like on a busy,(avoid weekends).

Whilst the rides at both Aquaventure and Wild Wadi are similarly good, the layout of Wild Wadi is miles ahead. For almost all of the tube rides at Wild Wadi, you only have to queue up once and then you are transported around the entire park as one ride automatically leads to another. This is great as it saves time having to climb up towers and queuing again and again. The surf rides are a nice touch and all of the staff appear extremely friendly and helpful.As expected, exrras such as lockers, towels and food is not cheap but the park itself is amazing. If you have to choose one between Wild Wadi and Aquaventure then in my opinion, Wild Wadi trumps it by far."

Before entering we charge 300AED for 3 people as extra charges and chrged the fees of towels and lockers. they deduct those fees from our extra charges infact we had paid while buying tickets. When we went for lunch the stuff told there is no any $ inside of watches but we checked them on balance system it showed 2 of them have 120 AED. Only its finance made me confused."

I don't mean those full body swim suits, they were in jeans, saris, cargo pants,belts, leggings and what have you and decided to \"launder\" their clothes in the children's pool, only one of them was a child. Four different lifeguards and other attendants asked them to leave the pool and to go change their clothes, but as the father decided to pretend to be deeply offended by this and argued with the personnel, the rest of the family sat in the pool soaking their dirty outer wear. None of the staff managed to get them out to get changed and an hour later they were still there. Looking around we started noticing more and more people in the pool in their outdoor clothes, even a baby buggy found its way in the pool. For an extortionate entrance fee , you would expect hygiene to be high on the list of things in WW, it's not. Won't be going there again. Yuk!"

The rides were generally good with guide signs indicating the level of excitement, which on the whole were pretty accurate.After having spent a day at Atlantis water park we were a little surprised to find the water to be salt water and unheated. As with the other water parks in Dubai you have to pay extra for a locker and towels, which is a bit much bearing in mind the cost of entry. There were various food outlets that several different foods, pizza, BQ etc. the ones we tried were good and reasonably priced.Plus Points: The weather, the ridesNegatives: Price, could get cramped when busy, extra cost for lockers and towels"

It was my first visit to Wild Wadi after I have been to another famous water park in Dubai a couple of times before.Let's start with the entry and pricing... we arrived by car and although it was public holiday and crowded I found the parking experience rather pleasant. The spots are pretty tight though and I have seen some bigger SUVs struggling to get in (one of the huge advantages when you are driving a small rental...). Pricing is steep with only one price for full day access (295 AED), other options would be a good idea (e.g. 4 hour ticket, reduced entry for early birds, online booking offers,...). The prices for 'add-ons' leave a bitter taste though...the base price is giving you entry only: you want to rent a towel? That's 35 AED (no, you cannot keep it afterwards). You want to lock your valuables? That's another 35 AED. Prices of food and drinks within the park are similarly high, a photo of you on the rides will set you back a whopping 150 AED (so if you are planning on having some pictures better bring your own GoPro or other cam).The park is relatively small and offers not as many rides as I expected based on my experiences with competitors' parks. Also the 'connected rides' are not as extensive as in the other park.Overall I had a nice day out but will probably look for an alternative next time in Dubai."

Not only was this an unpleasant experience, I was also thoroughly interrogated by the staff why I had fallen off and they didn't believe me when I said I hadn't done it on purpose.

The speed slide is not for the faint hearted,was a long way walking up and the grounds are very very hot so take some pool shoes for children(must) and adults if you can. We tried the Tuntrum Alley and may oh may was it fun, i would highly suggest to the management to take pictures just before taking of and customers can buy them like all the rest. The Juhar family area is wonderful for small kids. There was a good restaurant with plenty to eat and choose from. There is also a shop where you can buy just about any pool stuff you need including children. Family pictures are all available but at an affordable price. Overall it was very pricey, we paid for 1 medium locker, food for two adults and 1child. 2 pictures as souvenirs and 1 fish pedicure which was 40dhm, 1 small bottle of water, and 3 slashes total 1800dhm equivalent to \u00a3300. Yes its expensive but worth the fun. I wouldn't bother getting a locker as we ended up taking our stuff out and putting everything close to us,everyone around us did the same and all was safe. I will highly state that the customer service was absolutely spot on, they were all very nice and kind. Very helpful and kept an eye on everyone,helped kids and adults wear there safety jackets on the Breaker Bay area where the pool has waves. Everyone smiled and seemed to enjoy doing there job,i talked in length to a few girls at the restaurant and they seemed happy to work there.

More suited for those with older children or at least over 1.1 metres in order to benefit from the more exciting rides.It is difficult to highlight which was the best \"ride\", but in my opinion the Jumeirah Sceira was the best. Although my children voted for other rides. All in all the experience was well worth it and very popular. During the holiday periods and weekends it could be a slower experience, but weekday afternoons seem to be the best times to go. One point to note is that speedos for men are not advisable, in fact they might not even be permitted. Best to wear shorts."

My expectations were that of a larger and more varied park but once being there I realised it is more compact (and therefore manageable!) than I thought. In just over 2 hours I managed all the fun. So i guess it was a fantastic opportunity and worth the visit even if entry and facility prices are on the high side of things. A must when in Dubai."

We are both in our thirties but had a nightmare stay at our hotel in Dubai so needed some cheering up! When you stay at a Jumeirah hotel you get free entry to the water park (which is really welcome as it would have cost about \u00a380 for 2 adults) The park is incredible - we went on all the rides including the super scary Jumeirah sceirah - a vertical drop, travelling at about 80km/h - which takes about 10 seconds if that! The park is really well maintained and organised and if I had children I wouldn't hesitate in taking them. The changing rooms are clean and you are given a wristband you load money onto so you don't have to carry any money around with you.The rides are all awesome! There are the intense thrill rides like the sceirah and tantrum alley, the thrill rides like the Burj Surj and the incredible 'Master Blaster' that blasts you in a rubber ring on up and down around 11 slides that go around the entire park - we were like big kids all day and all the rides have the stunning Burj Al Arab looming in the background so its quite scenic too! The food is okay too - nothing gastronomically amazing - just burgers and chips, nuggets etc - but it isn't too expensive.A great day out - I would definitely visit again."

Also a bit pricey but worth it if your there for a good part if the day and use all the rides. Key tip. The main ride starts at the bottom so you can't just pick up a tube and walk to the top you should therefore do the main ride before 12 to avoid the ques. And don't take any hats glasses or shoes to the scary tunnel ride at the top because you will have to walk back up to pick them up."

The big problem tho is the rides that push you along when in a 2 man or 1 man ring. There wasn't enough power to push me and my friend up and the ride had to be stopped as we came back down highly embarrassing when people start laughing as we where stuck. And at 12 stone each I expected it to have worked no people at the other parks. All in its an ok day but the price compared to Yas water world it's not great at all."

Count down from 3 and the trap door opens and you fall vertically down for about 25m before you finally start feeling the slide under your back. Adrenaline pumping so hard your hands shake for minutes afterwards. The second is tantrum ally. A raft ride down chutes where at some points the raft lifts so high up the tunnel you think you going to fall over. Great fun but the rest of the park is more for kids."

Great for the kids as they can toddle off for ice cream,drinks etc with no worries. Make sure you have a go and the water shoot ride that sends you around the edge of the park. Best laugh we have had in years. Lifeguards are everywhere and there is a large wave pool with hundreds of life vests for the kids of every size so they can enjoy the waves. Make sure you do the rides etc early on as we found around 3pm it got very busy with the locals. We visited this and the Atlantis and we all preferred wild wadi but maybe that may be the ages of the kids as most reports said the Atlantis was better but ages of kids were a little older. Worth noting that keep applying sun lotion as it gets rubbed off with all the rides. either that or buy the swim tops as they are factor 30/50 resistant."

We had a great time although we did not visit on a daily basis (the first visit took two days to get the lactic acid out of my system - I am finally realising that I am getting a little old for vertical slides, although the lazy river is wonderful). You can get a fabulous tan here, but always remember to be careful, especially with little ones.

The most we waited was probably about 10 minutes. Buy your tickets online for quicker park entry. Some tips: don't wear a necklace if you're going on the speed slide (it has to be removed). The ground gets quite hot if your feet aren't wet - be warned. Some people wear sunglasses and flip-flops. Put some credit on your wristband if you think you might want lunch/drink - it's SO much more convenient that going back to the locker rooms. There aren't a lot of maps around. The taxi drop-off can get a bit congested so get dropped off at the souq or nearby and just walk up. Such a fun time."

What a disappointment especially after visiting Aquaventure at Atlantis.I visited with my husband and 2 small toddlers. The wait for a couple of double doughnuts with a child seat in each took over 15 minutes. That's 15 minutes of standing waiting & watching the spare doughnuts go round looking for what we needed. There just aren't enough.The water is cold. This may be a good thing if you're boiling in the Dubai heat but its almost too cold. The concrete walls & base of the channels tear your feet apart. Its jam packed & the queues take forever & those queues are not pleasant. We'd just spent 4 days at Atlantis where entry to Aquaventure is complementary and what a difference. If WW is the only water park you visit you may be impressed but do yourself a favour & visit Aquaventure for a truly amazing experience.There was one particular event that wrote WW off completely for us. A child defecated in the childrens play area in Wild Wadi. The staff on patrol evacuated the area & turned the water off in the area. The life gaurds told us 'safety test'. I felt it was well handled at the scene although a child was allowed to wander around not wearing any pants in the lead up to the event. If the child, or childs parents, had been told that the child cannot enter the area without wearing pants then the situation may have been minimised.My family left the park straight afterwards as were not keen to enter the water again & a staff member at the exit asked if we had enjoyed our time. I replied 'no because a child had defecated in the pool'. The staff member laughed at me and joked about 'poo in the pool'. I was very serious with her & said that its disgusting & we are leaving because its unsanitary now. Once again she laughed and didn't understand my concern. She should have taken my complaint seriously. We had 3 days to access WW and did not go back. Instead enjoyed the pool at Jumierah Beach hotel."

Previously all staff seemed really fit, sporty and very people-oriented - whereas now some seemed disinterested in both what they were doing and the customers, which affects the experience.Another thing is the price-gouging. You pay a lot to get into this park, and food, drink (including water) and other things like sun screen are EXTREMELY expensive. Just plain nasty to pay $40 for a small bottle of sunscreen for example. Finally, the pavements and walkways used to be always damp and this helped reduce the heat on your feet. This time many of the walkways were dry and it was easy to burn your feet. Having whinged though, I still had a great time and would go back again"

Getting a chance in Jumeirah Sceirah is time taking but experience is great! Burj Surj and Tantrum alley are really pumped the adrenaline but also great fun if you are a group! Wipeout and riptide is for veteran surfers but nice to experiences the power of water.Entire park is well maintained and enormously landscaped."

However the surf wave attraction wasn't working due to some maintenance which was not mentioned at the entrance.I woudl highly recommend a visit during the week since the park is to crowded on weekends. Also avoid regional public holidays otherwise you might end up waiting one hour for a single ride.Food offers could be more healthy and is basically limited to pizza and burgers.Have a splashy day"

I must say it is a very expensive day out and couldn't believe we had to pay extra for a locker when we got there!It's not an easy park to find your way around, we got a bit lost and couldn't locate where we left our shoes! I would recommend wearing flip flops which you can take off and leave on a shoe rack by each ride otherwise you will burn your feet.We had a really great time and laughed till our sides hurt.One thing I will mention is I would think twice about going on the Jumeirah Sceirah which is one of the scariest rides there. I managed to rip a big hole in my bikini bottoms on the ride, luckily I had bought a spare pair. I was also left with a very painful friction burn at the bottom of my back which is still sore and weeping. It is agony to sit down. I saw really small children going on this ride so for this reason I would think twice about going on this one. But there are plenty of others!Overall we are glad we went and it is a great way to get out of the August heat."

The weather in March was about 26 Celsius so we wore short sleeved wet suits.... and we were the ONLY ones in the park with them! But we were very comfortable in temperature. We arrived about 11am and left about 5pm. We bought tickets at the gate. If you stay at Jumeriah properties you get free entry. There are lockers for rent. You must buy food there. There are lots of slides and rides , including surf rider type wave rides where you lie on a boogie board and try to ride a 'wave'. These are all included in the price. There is a large wave pool where most people had on flotation devices! Coming from an island, we take it for granted that everyone knows how to swim......The best part was the 11 slides that are connected by jets that push you uphill up each slide so you can sit on the tube the whole time. It was fabulous. We also went on the speed slide that went straight down.... I think most of the men were amazed to see two young girls (7 and 9 yrs) on this ride but they loved it. They were able to go on every ride. Can't wait to go back next time... hopefully in hotter weather!"

Access was complimentary as part of our stay and my girls (aged 12 and 10) were in there every day without fail. We have visited Dubai before and done The Atlantis waterpark too but both my girls say The Wild Wadi is far better. In Atlantis there is a lot of dragging your tube to go on rides which you don't have to do at Wild Wadi and the lazy river is a great way to relax for adults too. Definitely in the hot temperatures a visit to the waterpark is a must and a great way to cool down. The park opens at 10am and if you go first thing you can get on all the rides straight away. Being August and local school holidays it did get very busy from lunchtime onwards. Food is very expensive (but always the way with any theme park). At roughly just under \u00a3200 for a family of four it is not a cheap day out but as we had it complimentary could not complain. Great fun and worth a visit."

Take your own camera, use it for your own snaps and then store it in your locker; do take small locker for your own comfort and avoid their photographers by politely refusing their services as one snap would cost you 125 AED. Snacks and drinks are available but again on very expansive side. Visit in the morning around 10 am as the weather is bearable and due to less people you can take and enjoy many rides in less time; after 1130 the place get hot and packed with people and you may have to wait upto 30 minutes for a particular ride.

I sugest visitors should enquire about the locker situation before you put your clothes in, your wristband allows one access, however you can pay to have unlimited access for a small locker throughout the day, approx uae 35"

You go down or along the water slides and end up on a travel after belt or water jet that pushes you to the next ride. You do have to que up for the wave machine attractions, but they push you through quite fast. The place is nice and clean and the food is a typical theme park. You put money on a wrist watch type gizmo which allows you to hire a locker and buy food. You get the balance back at the end of the day.

They simply cant get bored as there are a number of water based activities to do to keep them busy for hours! In fact even my wife and me loved the experience - particularly watching the kids enjoying themselves so much. There are slides going upwards by water jets, than more daring rides like Jumeirah Sceirah and Tantrum Alley which my 6 year old went on. There is a place within the park called FISHO - where you dip your feet in water full of fish who nibble at your dead skin on your feet. 20 mins = 55dhms which is just under \u00a310.For those observing the islamic faith, you will feel extremely comfortable here as many of the park visitors wear islamic dress (mainly women) so you will not feel out of place.Wild wadi has lots of fast food restaurants, that actually make the food fresh, so waiting times are 10-15mins upon an order of food. A meal on average is about 52Dhms or \u00a39. This includes a large drink, large fries, and chicken kebab or chiken tikka or burger etc... My 3 kids could easily share the chicken tikka meal.Also a few shops on site selling Wild Wadi merchandise like swim suits, burkini's for islamic women, shorts, sunglasses, hats, sun cream, swim shoes, keyrings, toys, fridge magnets etc,Would recommend if you have kids as it is fantastic day out."

If you go there in the summer I would recommend you wear some form of water shoes as the floor (concrete and wooden) gets extremely hot and burns your feet as you walk (our as in our case) run between rides.Try to get the two for one voucher before you visit as that will save a good few pennies. The only thing that disappointed me a little was that on one of the rides my other half twisted her ankle, whilst they were prompt in looking at problem, they basically left us to our own devices after they had given her an ice pack, they didn\u2019t even advise us where the first aid area was on site, we only found it by luck, they also asked her to signed a disclaimer before we left the first aider.

When anyone asks me we have only two days in Dubai, I tell them, make sure you visit Dubai mall, wild wadi and Desert Safari by Arabian Adventures."

There's enough rides to keep you busy for a few hours and longer if you have children. So many great views of the city from various rides. The tandem ride is hair raising, I only did it once. My hubby did the big drop and enjoyed it. It all looked very clean. The only negative comment I'd add is there was an unpleasant smell to the place at times. Definitely worth a trip."

            "review": "Exciting and Fun. This is based on a resident review..being brought up in dubai I feel like I need to put my review out there for Wild wadi. Now this is a fantastic water park and also voted the best one in UAE.At the moment its about 295 dirhams per Adult however after my visit a few days ago I would highly suggest to purchase tickets online if possible as the queues tend to be longer. Another suggestion would also to go on weekdays between Sunday-wednesday as the days like Thursday-Saturday are peak weekend days and the park is packed up and you may have to wait for an avg of 15-20 Min just to get on a ride and that can be quite annoying. A small issue I had at the locker room which i feel needs to be shared is that the water park has 3 different types of locker form small to medium and large. Now if you buy the medium locker for example but by mistake use you wrist band watch and swipe over the small locker instead then the funds are deducted immediately and you can't use the medium locker then in case you wanted to change after you realised it was the wrong locker!. I had this issue whereby I mistakenly used the small locker even thou I paid for the medium locker and I had to wait for almost 30 minutes! just so the security guard can take my wrist band and go back to the cashier counter or wherever it was he went to sort it out. This could be quite frustrating having to wait there just because you used the wrong locker. Other then this the water park is great and has lots of rides. The Jumeirah Sceirah is a MUST try and is the best ride that they have. A Burger meal with fries and a drink will cost you 49 AED and you have to pay 2 dirhams extra just for a slice of cheese as it doesn't come with it! so I suggest you put some extra money on to your wrist band for meals and also they have a store in the park where you can get some really cool Wild Wadi merchandises. I bought a water proof case which can be used for any phone and its really cool if you want to have some under water pics for memories you can take away with you. It will cost you 120 dirhams and its better then paying for the pictures which the wild wadi staff take of you during different slides as one pic may cost around a 100 dirhams! If you have any money left on your wrist band you can get it back later on when you leave and it will be refunded to you as cash even if you had used a credit card to pay for it. They won't refund it back to the credit card they will just give you cash instead. I hope this review may help people out there. Do also check out other exciting water parks like Aquaventure at Atlantis and also Ice land!"

Located on Jumeriah Beach, near the base of the distinctive Burj Al Arab, Wild Wadi Water Park is a water theme park housing around 10 different rides, slides and pools suited for people of all ages. From the pleasantly relaxing Juha's Journey river ride to the 32m tall exhilarating Jumeirah Sceirah tower slide, Wild Wadi will keep you entertained for the better part of a day, or until you can't handle the Dubai sun anymore. With that said, the abundance of refreshing pools and rivers keeps you cool for longer than you would expect. I particularly enjoyed the Tantrum Alley ride which seats up to four people and shoots you down into three tube like structures at which point you are buffeted from side to side and drenched from head to toe. I was fortunate enough to go during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan which meant the park was a lot less crowded than normal. Wait times for rides was virtually non-existent which allowed me to make multiple use of all the rides. This probably enhanced the experience somewhat, but even if the park was at capacity, wait times according to the signage littered around the park was no more than 30 minutes. Basic food and beverages can be purchased at various vendors around the park and there are ample locker facilities to store clothes and valuables. Whether you are an adult travelling with friends, or a young family with kids, I highly recommend Wild Wadi to firstly escape some of the Dubai heat, and secondly to feel that sense of wild fun an excitement that is usually only reserved for children."

We missed a perfect opportunity for some photos with amazing views .That said you can opt to buy any of the photos they take of you on the rides etc. You get a locker when going in for a small fee. You can put money on your wrist band to save from carrying cash / cards around and if you buy one of the novelty cups you get free refills of water throughout the day. You can also hire towels. There are a good selection of eateries & places to get drinks which were also reasonably priced. Seemed to be adequate sun loungers and seats. W.C & changing facilities were good standard , well maintained & clean. Great for all ages you can opt to make a full day of it : or like us spend a morning there.

Its a good watermark, the two big raft rides are good for thrill seekers but also good for wimps like me as you feel quite safe. The jet slides that take you round the park are good fun, you can go in these as a two or solo, however later in the day they get really busy and you have to wait in the pools in between the jets. I was quite disappointed in the lazy river as it really was lazy! It was better to walk than float through it. Its also quite layered so you don't have the space that you do in Atlantis nor do you have a beach which is a shame although you do get an excellent view of the Burj al Arab. I would visit this again if there was a 241 promotion but wouldn't pay full price for it."

The majority are horizontal water jet type slides which take you around the park. They are fun but probably only need to be done once. The largest slide is definitely more intense than the rest of the park by far and worth a go if you like fast slides. The thing to be considered most about this place is the entry price. It is 305 Dirham (about $100 US/AUD) each. which in my opinion is not worth it. Located all around the park are photographers who take pictures throughout your visit and are available for purchase at the end of your visit. Common practice for most tourist attractions. Not a very common price though. We had 9 pictures taken of us in our visit and were offered to us at a 'sale' price of 325 Dirham (little more than $100 US/AUD) for digital copies only!!! 9 pictures for more than the the actual entry price! Maybe visit this park if you have young kids and are prepared to pay but don't expect too much."

On a short break in a Dubai with two of my friends we decided , with a certain apprehension to visit , the Wild Wadi Waterpark . It came with free admission , as part of our stay at the Dar al Masyaf . Wild and Wadi it is , just great fun from start to finish . There is a lovely sea side feel with the sea effect pool . Great seating and sun beds , and to top it all fantastic water adventure rides . We took to our big rubber rings to meander down the lazy river , having great fun trying not to get soaked from the waterfalls . There is no limit to how often you wish to go round , it us peaceful , fun and relaxing . Our next trip , this time just two of us , one very sensible friend decided the fast water rides were not for her and she would stay gracefully floating . Myself and my other friend took to a double ring and shot off down the rapids screaming , whirring in a Bob sleigh like fashion down a waters Shute . Next came a very wet long dark tunnel , (why did I close my eyes ) . We screamed , we laughed . This can be a place for adventure , or to relax , try it , you will want to return . A little tip , wear full swim suit , your bikini bottoms can ride down a little when facing the rapids !  ."

Temperatures were in the high 40's which did make walking on the concrete with bare feet painful. Some good food deals available for around 50AED. The wristbands area great idea for loading on money which you can use for pay for food, drinks or souvenirs. Any money not spent is refunded at the end of the visit. Love the new rides particularly the one where you are locked in a capsule and after the countdown the floor vanishes beneath you! The life guards are plentiful and very friendly and great fun too.

Wild Wadi had a Ramadan offer whereby you could exchange three items of clothing for an entry ticket.Very excited at the prospect of a free activity in the massively expensive summer holidays, I went there with my son (aged 5) and his friends (both aged 8).As you can imagine it was insanely busy and the queues were long. They did have a fast track queue for paying guests though and the queue moved as quickly as can be expected. I could see management were out in force ensuring that everything went smoothly and then we were in. Despite the high traffic, the park was well maintained and clean.The life guards were as consciences as usual and managers were available to point out that although my sons friends met the height requirements, they were too slim to sit comfortably in the tubes and it was unsafe.We had three hours of water fun, before heading home, when, as you can imagine with three kids in tow, I realised on driving home that I had forgotten to remove the credit from my wristband.I called them immediately, they took my details and I went back two days later to collect the money, no problem, thank goodness I had kept the receipt.My only observation for the day would be that I would not return on a busy day in a pick up truck as the car park is not very generous if you have to go up to the next level.

I recommend anyone who's in town for awhile to come down to Jumeirah to visit this park and have a great day. Two thumbs up for Wild Wadi!"

We were WRONG!We got free tickets from our hotel and decided to give Wild Wadi a try.That was brilliant experience and great fun for both of us , even in our age group - 30-40 years old :)We spent a whole day here, enjoyed the rides and have absolutely lovely day!Our personal favourite was \"Tantrum Alley\" - very nice!Only one downside - as we are both a healthy eaters we couldn't find any healthy food here. Only pizzas, burgers, etc, we have not children yet but I think that little ones deserve real food, not a junk."

We spent a day here in June when it was 40+ degrees outside and we were wondering how to keep our four year old cool. We were in Dubai three days at the end of our main holiday in Mauritius. So we spent the Saturday at Wild Wadi - a great choice. There is something for everyone, and our son loved the family dhow and lagoon area in the middle of the park and the slow floating river where huge water showers rain down on you at the beginning and end. We got there early and with free tickets form our hotel were ushered to the front of the queue and got free towel hire. Towel hire was 35 dirhams each otherwise and then you have to pay for locker hire too 35-65 dirhams, so with the entrance fee at 275 dirhams per person it all adds up.Saturdays are very busy, being the last day of the weekend, so get there early to find seats/sunbeds with shade. We were lucky and found three right by Leila's oasis. Our little boy enjoyed it so much as did we, that we ended up staying there all day and we had a great time. We ate pizza for lunch as all choices are fast-food, not ideal for us healthy eaters, but for a large pizza and a big drink it was about \u00a310, so not too bad at all and it was cooked to order.One big issue for us was the lack of toilets for ladies in the main part of the park. Men have the luxury of toilets in the changing rooms at the entrance and in the middle of the park - us ladies have to go back to the entrance every time. This proved a problem for us with a four year old wanting the loo and finding it hard to hold on, while I sprinted, carrying him (as the ground was scorching in places where it wasn't cooled by water) from the dhow/lagoon area to the entrance ladies toilets.I read reviews before going about the maintenance, but the only thing we had issues with were the cargo nets on the dhow/lagoon area. Our son fell and grazed himself and medics appeared from nowhere and cleaned the graze and put a big plaster on.All in all a great day out, but not a cheap one if you have to pay your own entrance fees."

Try and get the early and get a lounged at the front of the main pool. No shoes are allowed on the rides so you need to make a run for it from your lounger to the slides as your feet will burn on the ground. Will be returning next year and will definitely visit again."

Since it was kind of low season the queues weren't bad at all and we had a great time. Just a few things can be better.Firstly, the water in most of the rides is freezing cold. Coming out of the scorching sun into freezing water isn't a very pleasant experience and your body doesn't ever get accustomed to the temperature of the water.Secondly, it seems there is only 1 toilet in the entire park. The main changing rooms are signposted for toilets but there are no toilets there. The only toilets I found were behind the children's play area.Finally, the food is decent but the variety of the food can be a little better.Also, please have some sort of indication posted as to when the waves will begin in the pool. It's no fun waiting in the hot sun for the waves to start."

Entrance fee to the Wild Wadi is a bit steep but we had a very good time. You cannot take food and drink inside. We were offered at time of purchase of entrance tickets, meal vouchers at a discount which we refused. With hindsight we should have bought these meal vouchers as it was a good bargain. The place was packed for a midweek visit by us and it was a normal school and work day for the people of Dubai. Also pay a deposit for locker to store your personal belongings at time of purchasing your entrance tickets. There are several rides but we went on a few rides we enjoyed a few times.

The floating river could have been better if tubes were removed to avoid clog up of inflatables- also potentially dangerous as small children can get lost in the mass of these. While staff are generally friendly and helpful, there was a lady at the gate who was not so helpful/ customer friendly when we inquired about free meal for holders of Emirates ID cardholders. She not so politely told us that we should know about this promotion and ask upon ticket purchase- is it really a customer's job to 'know' about promotions and ask rather than staff being proactive and sharing information? Other than that- great experience and will return."

It appears to be geared the same as Florida because it has the waves like at the Blue Lagoon and the lazy river. We visited for 3 consecutive days as we were staying next door at Jermeriah Beach Hotel. The rides are colour coded from easy to hard so you can choose which ones to go on. It is a well organised place. Make sure that you apply plenty of sun screen and drink plenty of water which you are allowed to take in with you. However, you are not allowed to take in food as there are plenty of eateries once there. I would definitely recommend going here."

Adults & kids alike can enjoy a great day at this park, in particular as the Dubai heat soars from May onwards.Ok the 'meal deal' on offer is nothing special & it's basically fast food. It's not overpriced given the quality of the park, it's what you'd expect at a venue like this.If you're visiting Dubai with your family, with friends or as a couple go to Wild Wadi & have some fun.

Though there had been some confusion regarding our booking confirmations that took a bit of effort to solve, it was a memorable experience from start till end. The day was not busy at all, and we had many chances on all rides, without any queues. The atmosphere was very friendly with staff all cheery, smiling and even joking with us. The rides were fantastic, especially the fast river ride #1, Torrent Alley and Sceriah. The showering water in one of the shallow pools was like being under a water fall. The body boarding was very cool, and we both enjoyed having a go at it, though I couldn't last more than a few seconds. We took several photos in between and some of those were not available by the end of the day, which was a bit disappointing. Also, it would have been great if the fast rides had allowed us to carry a head mounted camera. Hope you can make the experience better by adding some faster and longer rides. We found the lazy river to be a bit too long for its pace. It would have been excellent fun if it were a slow down-hill ride from a height allowing views of Dubai city and the ocean in a lazy way. I usually had to get off the tube and push her forwards for the entire tract of the lazy river, as it just was a bit too lazy. Also, it would have been great to experience a longer faster river ride leading up to the lazy river. Similarly, something that is 3 times the length of Torrent Alley or Burj Surge will make them an even more exciting experience. All in all, a very awesome water park, probably the best in Dubai and we are sure to return."

No need to shlep a wallet or purse as you do this when you enter the park, put your stuff in a small locker and enjoy your day.Whatsmore, any funds you put on the card you dont use is refunded when you leave. We stayed at the Burj Al Arab and were pleased to find there was no fee for entrance as it was a Jumeriah property and all guests staying at any of their 5 properties get free admittance.

It's definately worth going, it has beautiful views too. Just go with a lot of people so it's more fun. Also**** u can get free admission if you stay at burj al Arab. Idk about Jumeirah beach but check!"

            "review": "Great for big kids too!. This was our first visit to Wild Wadi and as a group of four adults we thoroughly enjoyed our day being big kids!Wild Wadi has a range of rides from siting on big rubber single or two person rings on White Water to four person rings on Burj Surj and Tantrum Alley, surfing or lazing on the beach.The White Water Wadi ride was our favourite, the longest ride with uphill water jets to push you along rather having to get out a regular intervals to climb upstairs, the ride also has options at various locations, so you can chose a different chute and try a different experience. We took the advice of other reviewers and rented a cabana for the day. The cabanas are quite tucked away in a quiet corner, which was great for us as four adults, as you felt you were leaving the hustle and bustle of queues to lie on a lounger and enjoy a break. The cabana was provided with four loungers, table and four chairs, eight towels, fridge with complimentary water and soft drinks, waiter service for food and fast track access to White Water Wadi which was an advantage as the day got busier.The bathroom/shower/changing facilities are quite small, only a couple of each in the block nearest the cabanas, but are kept very clean throughout the day.Overall a great day out in Dubai!"

Wave pool, two water rides is just what we needed (+ some kids rides for parents). Rides were fine, lifeguards were omnipresents (I wonder whether it's because of tourists or locals). We didn't try surfin' rides as there was a huge queue in front of each one... But for a free entrance, it was worth it. Don't expect something huge, but for 2-3 hours to enjoy especially if it's included in your hotel stay, it's really worth it."

I would say for a family with younger children (8 and 11) Wild Wadi is slightly better as it has two rides that you can do as a family in a four person ring (Burj Surj and Tantrum Alley). The White Water Wadi ride is also great to do as a family and is quite a long ride so makes the wait in the queue feel worthwhile. We took the advice of other reviewers and rented a cabana for the day. The location was disappointing as the website says 'prime beach location' and I expected something close to Breakers Bay or Juha's Dhow and Lagoon area but the cabanas are quite tucked away and you cannot supervise younger children without leaving the cabana. It's convenient as you are guaranteed a lounger and have somewhere to leave your valuables but given the price, I would rent a locker next time. You do get fast track access to White Water Wadi which on busier days would be an advantage."

Also a good feature is you can put money on your wrist band so you can lock your valuables away and don't have to keep returning to the lockers. Any money left on the bands gets returned when you leave. The place is clean but a bit dated in parts. We had been to the Atlantis first so compared it to that which we thought was much better. There was lots of sunbeds and chairs but I'd recommend you get there early if you want one. Also a lot of the sunbed areas had sail like shades over you so not very good if you want to get a tan but good if you like to stay in the shade. The wave pool was good but a long wait for the waves to start. Lots of places to eat we had a pizza which was made to order and was very reasonably priced. My daughter & husband had a great time on all the slides although they did have to que for a while."

The bracelets can also have photos (taken by the Staff) saved to the bracelet so you can collect all your images at once. The rides were great, all in great condition. The location is perfect with the Burj Al Arab in the background of a lot of your photos.Food is reasonably priced and of decent quality.

You could borrow t shirts to avoid any embarrassing moments.It is expensive about \u00a350 per person but worth every pound. We got there at 10 and left at 6 only stopping for a 30 minute lunch.

So no value for money but extreme luxury. You get your own fridge with free refills, 3 beds, towels and a table with chairs including a parasol. Plus you get VIP access to a single but busiest ride. The package also comes with a butler that will take your order and bring your food. So no standing in line.The rides in the park are great for all ages. Ranging in scariness :-) The least scary is the pool for the very young and the most scary is a vertical drop from a very high tower.In the middle you have different rides, again ranging in scariness depending on speed and turns.There is only one issue which is that when one of the rides is closed, too much water pressure goes to the other rides and in that case it is really recommended to use a single tube for you and your kid.Security is fantastic. Very kind staff. Even if you come without swimwear you can buy everything you need in the store. You don't need to bring a camera because professional photographers take your pictures. Of course they're very expensive but then again they come in a nice frame.In the pool every now and then there are waves. The life guards are everywhere and very attentive.On-site there are life vests for guest who cannot swim but still want to enter the pool. There is music for all kinds. Popular, Arabic, European, etc.I recommend you go early, it opens at 10 and if you don't take a Cabana then quickly find a chair. There are not only chairs around the pool but also in higher areas so don't give up too quickly.Lockers are there. You can use an electronic wallet and pay using it for everything. No hassle."

Even though it was a weekend, it didn't feel too crowded and the queues for rides went down reasonably quickly. The rides are well attended with hundreds of lifeguard staff. We really enjoyed the lazy river rides!However, I would say it's showing it's age a little. It's not huge and there aren't really that many rides - the advertising saying 30 attractions is really quite misleading as there are 9 or so main attractions and a good looking kiddies section. They could do with one or two more big rides and after a while it's a bit samey. The layout of the park is also a bit confusing though once you get the hang of it you realise it's small! There is a bit of a funny damp smell around the park at points, but I suppose it's to be expected given its age. For the price of the ticket, we expected more rides. Also you have to pay for the use of a locker when you get in - an extra 35 dirhams for a small one. Given that everyone is going to need a locker, we thought this was a total rip off and should be included with the ticket price as standard. On a side note, we booked our tickets through Ticketmaster. When we arrived Wild Wadi said that these were not valid this year as their contract with Ticketmaster was for 2013 only (despite us having called Wild Wadi before booking to check that they accepted Ticketmaster tickets). It was annoying and wasted some of our time when we got there but they did sort it out in the end. The main thing to note is don't buy your tickets through Ticketmaster - just go direct through the Wild Wadi site, even though it's more expensive - it will be worth it."

Staff are everywhere and very responsive. Queues for some popular rides were up to 20 minutes but got much shorter nearer to closing time. Some of the rides are truly take-your-breath-away thrilling so even though they were short we waited to do them multiple times (Jumeriah Sceriah is 11 seconds, and Tantrum Alley is 55 seconds). Wristband system for lockers and stored money is nice."

There are less rides and a mixture of extreme, thrilling and family. Take towels as hire charge is expensive at about \u00a35 each, when you get your ticket you are offered food vouchers which are probably worth getting and you can put money on your wrist band which is worth doing, any unused is refunded at the shop before you leave. Locker hire is available, but you would probably be ok to leave your bags on a lounger. We want during the week, and the queues were ok. A good day out."

My young children really enjoyed the kids area and swimming pool with waves. They did not want to leave and had to be dragged away. Happy kids = Happy Parents. One small complaint was the locker facilities which are controlled by wrist tags which can be topped up with monetary funds and can be used to purchase food, gifts and hire lockers in the changing rooms. My tag did not recognise my locker when I went to get something out of it for a second time. The problem was resolved by the locker room attendant. ....but it almost took 45 minutes and I missed out on quality time in the water park with my wife and children. On a sour note.....a very rude member of staff named Lydia refused me and my family entrance to the adjoining Jumeriah beach hotel via the side / beach entrance. We had planned to eat at one of their restaurants with our half board vouchers which can be used at selected places in any Jumeriah restaurant. I explained that I was staying at the JZS and showed her my vouchers which clearly stated that I could eat there. She dismissed them and said they were not valid. I gave her my hotel room number to do a security check, which she refused. What was worse was a security guard next her said we were ok to go in. They were arguing between themselves. She insisted we had to leave the Wild Wadi park from the main entrance and walk on the main road to get inside the Jumeriah beach hotel. This is a 10 minute walk with 2 very young children who are tired and hungry. I made an official complaint to the duty manager Ralph Fernandez. Ralph was fantastic and very understanding. He arranged a table at the pizza restaurant on the beach and escorted us in person via the side entrance."

We arrived at approximately 4.00 pm with about two hours until closing, the entrance fee unfortunately remained full price and once we added two towels and a small locker it was quite expensive\u2026. However, we went into the changing rooms which were very clean, spacious, had toilets, showers, hair dryers, etc and changing cubicles. The lockers (and any spending money) are loaded onto and operated using a wrist-band which is all easy to use. We went and found a lounger to leave our towels and sandals and headed straight for a tube and the river. The river was so much fun (when my husband and I shared a double-tube, I\u2019ve never laughed so much), it enables you to stay in your tube and pushes you up (!) where you can get off for other rides or eventually go back down as a ride itself (or simply float around like a real river). There is a kiddy area, wave pool, \u2018flow-riding\u2019 wave and various rides with different \u2018thrill\u2019 rates (we rode most and my husband did the scary Jumeirah Sceirah twice and both times was anxious but completely exhilarated).The park was slightly confusing getting around and finding rides (when we weren\u2019t on the river), we referred to the various maps quite a lot. It\u2019s done nicely though, is really clean and tidy, with a pretty waterfall, rope bridges, loads of loungers/seating, little shops and great views from the top of some rides. There were also a large number of lifeguards and staff at various points on the river and at each ride.I\u2019m slightly self-conscious and together with being blonde and not all visitors being entirely \u2018westernised\u2019 was nervous about walking around and being in swimwear, however took a sarong with me and found that people were generally ok anyway (other people were wearing sarongs, t-shirts and some ladies were obviously covered up).We had such a brilliant and fun couple of hours, it was reasonably quiet so only had to queue once for about 10 minutes and the experience was all helped by the lovely warm weather. We could have done with a little longer than two hours to do some of the rides again, however we\u2019re not the kind of people to sit on a lounger so wouldn\u2019t have lasted all day and found that it just about right for us anyway. We would recommend a trip to Wild Wadi if you have a spare day in Dubai, or love with waterparks."

We have not come across this type of nonsense in any of the other waterparks. The deal comes with a nicely filled fridge/drinks. The rides are good fun.Still after spending 2 days at Wild Wadi we decided to get a taxi to Yas Waterworld which is still our all time favourite waterpark.Wild Wadi is still better than Aquaventure waterpark. Saying that, if you wanted to use all the other facilities at Atlantis like the dolphin bay it may still be worth a visit."

First thing I noticed my footwear (frivolous) and glasses were totally unnecessary they would not be allowed on the most of the rides so I had to drop them in the locker allotted to us. Call me chicken but my favourite rides were the more sedate ones, there were many for the more adventurous all of which I tried once at least.I have to admit it was fun I enjoyed my self ( when I stopped screaming) :)) Tip- go there early in the day to beat the queues on the rides as they can be long and tedious.

Choice of pizza / chicken or beef burger or hot dog with salad, fries and either a ice cream or watermelon plus a soft drink eg coke. When we got the food we paid another 2dhs to supersize the fries and coke. Plenty of food for 2 people. They even allowed us to go back and get the ice cream once we had finished eating! We got there at 1030. No need for a locker as we had no valuables. Dump you bag, sun lotion and towel on a sun lounger and head to the rides. There are several to choose from but do the big 3 first when there are no queues. You easily warm up / dry off so we only went back to towels twice. You can't take food and drink in - they check bags. Try the single surf wave machine first as usually a shorter queue. On leaving walk around the corner to the Jumeriah Beach Hotel to get a taxi home as the queue can be long, there were buses to Mall of the Emirates but not sure if free. Go and have fun and enjoy the wave machine. We were big kids again and it was brilliant!! 2 people in early 30s from London!"

Once you are finished with the water park you can walk across the road to the Madinat shops. The Burj Al Arab hotel is located outside the water park. You will not be able to walk into the Buri without being a guest or have a prior booking."

Immense Water park it has everything you could think of. even a wake boarding machine as well.There are plenty of lockers for you to put your stuff in take a pair of flip flops with you as you have to move around the park and it is hot on foot at timesthe que at the different rides can get log but it is worth it. my only down side is once you are in the food prices and drink prices are very expensive so b warned on that. you can defo spent the whole day there as lots to do.not just rides but also see sum of the sea creatures etc they have there and feed them"

Good things: Fantastic views of Burj Al Arab, Friendly staff, Not so busy between 10-12 so got on all rides within minuits, Plenty of Sunbeds, Cashless wrist thing works great and u get a refund if any credit left on at end of visit, First aid first class, Lifeguards plentiful and very professional.Not so good: Wife was thrown off Tantrum Alley ride at first vertical point az the dingy practically flipped over she and had to slide basically from the top to the bottom of the ride a very scary experience, The staff at the bottom appeared horrified she wasnt on the dingy, So my advice is hold on tight and go on in a group of 3 or 4 persons....It needs looked at safety wise in my opinion but hey other than tht was a great day, Oh one more thing guys if your heavier than 120kg they wont allow you on some rides....check the maximum weight on the rides as a solo rider and a couple b4 you grab a rubber ring...it will save you the embarrasment of the ride stopping halfway and having to be rescued lol....believe me it happens on that ride that shoots you uphill, if your too heavy the water stops flowing and you get stuck lol....seriously,,,but have a nice day.Ps....food priced reasonable, never tried the gift shops they always expensive."

Positives - One giant up hill water slide that circumnavigated the whole park and took you to every ride to save you walking. There was a lot of walking up and down stairs etc to get to the slides didn't mind the walking. - The staff are friendly and came up to us to offer assistance in directing us to slides and explaining how the park operated, there are lifeguards on all features, the body boarding was excellent to watch show boaters showed how it should be done and lifeguards helped to get the most out of the boards. - There are plenty of sun loungers and chairs to put towels, t-shirts - There were good amount of rides I thought I tried them all but actually only managed four: tantrum alley went on TA three or four times, jumeirah sceirah, master blasters all were briliant. - Discount voucher we got from the hotel leaflet corner gave us 35aed (approx \u00a36) off entrance fee - Life jackets for all ages - clean and well manned - Food was good we paid \u00a38 each for set meal - included a boxed salad, drink, beef burger, fries and ice-cream filling and god sized portions. There is a lot of food options and there is an option to load up a wrist band so as not to carry money around or pay up front from lunch menu.Negatives - Price 255 aed \u00a340 per person - Paying for locker and getting no refund the locker was 20-35aed (approx \u00a34-6) for a small locker adequate to get 2pairs of trainers a bag and valuables into with space. - 6 toilets in the womens changing rooms for the whole site?! We spent nearly \u00a3100 for the pair of us, not including journey there and back, I have never been before and enjoyed my day but having been to water parks in Turkey that might not have the same views but have similar slides the prices are more like \u00a312 per person I can't see why or how Wild wadi justifies the price really and much as I would like to go again I'm not sure I would because of the cost."

A couple of the rides were being maintained so were out of action, which was a bit disappointing, but the rides that were open had no queues, so we definitely made the most of our time there. Try and get there as soon as the park opens, it's a bit hard to find a sun lounger but as we spent all of our time in the water, we only really needed one to leave towels, shoes, sun creams etc. Entry price is quite steep, 245AED per person. However, if you are staying in Dubai for a few days, I would definitely recommend you buy a book called The Entertainer Dubai, 395AED, it is full of two for one vouchers (including Wild Wadi, the Atlantis Water Park, desert safaris, numerous restaurants and other attractions), so it paid for itself just by using two vouchers for our entrance to Wild Wadi. You can buy the book in most newsagents and book shops. Would go again as the children loved it!"

Wave pool was fun, kids area was a good size plus there were areas for surfing which was fun to watch. Not sure how it compares to other water parks in Dubai. With that said the grounds were very clean as was the water. Workers were very friendly and lots of lifeguards on the lookout. Decent amount of food choices (rather pricey though of course). If you're used to vast water parks you might be a bit bored, but do your research ahead of time to see if this place is right for you!"

We travelled to Dubai in December 2013 for one reason - my son wanted to see three things in Dubai; the Burj al Arab, the Burj Khalifa and the Wild Wadi Water Park.We had a nice day out at the water park. However the attractions were nothing exceptional. If you have been to other water park attractions around the world (as I write this I am thinking of the major water theme parks on the Gold Coast Queensland Australia), I would suggest you not put those into comparison with Wild Wadi, otherwise you're bound for disappointment. Also make sure you go prepared for the weather/sunburn as there is very little cover from the sun anywhere in this water park. A nice day out, but nowhere near what I expected from Dubai that likes to pride itself on being the biggest and best at everything engineered and man made."

On the negative side, it comes across as a public resort eg the smell of fast food, and chlorine can be over powering. However we had the luxury of dropping in, charging down some rides and then returning to our sun beds and thoroughly enjoyed the resort. The negative reviews seem to focus on the entrance fee which wasn't an issue for us.

It was perfect for us as we could come and go as we pleased, and we where in twice a day, avoiding the hot hot sun of July.There's a limited amount of rides, but there was enough to keep us all entertained whilst we were in the park. Enough so that the boys are raring for another trip back to Dubai to go here."

Don't go for only a few hours as there's the water slides/rides, a beach and lounge chairs etc to ensure you get plenty of value. I read some reviews complaining about the cost: it cost us about 1,400AED for 4 which included locker rental, towels, lunch, ice creams, drinks and park entry. It doesn't matter where you go to a fun park across the world - that's not too bad. Yes you can save 35AED per towel if you take your own, but as a traveler - who wants to pack a beach towel each?I've been there in Summer and now in Winter. I think summer was better but it was still great in winter (although cold later in the day).Just go be a kid again for a day! you will laugh and have fun."

With interconnected rides following a theme about an Arabian adventurer named Juha and his friend Sinbad the sailor, who get shipwrecked together,Wild Wadi, an attractive, compact Water Park is one of the major tourist attractions in Dubai. The location is brilliant, with views of the giant sail-shaped Burj Al Arab hotel and the Arabian Gulf when you ride your tube on the unending water slide. High-pressure pumps, which shoot you back up from ground level to the top of the slides let you do the same . The 33m-high Jumeirah Sceirah slide that drops you at a scary speed of 80km/h is said to be the fastest and steepest slide outside North America and the new slide tower featuring 'Tantrum Alley' and 'Burj Surj' is great fun, You will find gentle rides for young ones, a big-wave pool, a white-water rapids river. You can alsotry out your body boarding skills on Wipeout, a permanent wave machine. Though not cheap,Wild Wadi with its very friendly staff and beautiful setting it's a must-visit on your Dubai itinerairy."

This is definatley worth doing as I do not really do the water slides, and have been to water parks in the US and end up trying to find a chair. With the cabanna you get towels, fridge full of drinks, comfy beds and much needed shade. Also if you want anything from the food places they get it for you so you dont have to queue, plus you get 'fast pass' to the busy rides, which my teenage kids thought was great as they got to walk past everyone 'like they were famous or something'! plus I got a quiet place to chill out and read and the lazy river flow past in front of you, so I could take a dip in there to cool off.The rides I was informed my family were brilliant. They went on just about all of them more than once and voted it a much better park than the Atlantis one.Only complaint is the toilets are busy and not too good (should have own block for the cabannas!).Also we left when park was closing (around 5pm) as gets dark and there is a REALLY long queue for taxis and we waited for over an hour, plus then traffic bad so took nearly 2 hours to get back to hotel.Good day out for all the family , get there early for full day and if you can get a cabanna."

I laughed for the 4 hours we were there. Again the queues were lengthy but worth the wait. You can hire towels & lockers for a small fee. approx $7 Australian for a towel & a bit more for the locker. The food is fresh although most of it deep fried. You can't take any food or water of your own into the park. Everything available but at prices that you expect from a theme park. A good idea is the bracelet they give you which is your locker key, entry pass, & can be your bank roll as well so you don't have to take your wallet around with you. You can also hire a private kabana which looked cool. The down side was waiting for a taxi back to our accomadation. we learnt that often it's easier to get a taxi out in the street rather than wait in the organised queues."

Pro- the ride we did as a family was great... it was like riding rapids upwards! I lived that it led from one ride to another. It is one if the coolest watermark rides I've ever been on. There were plenty of food outlets with a decent variety of food for sale. Their prices were reasonable too. I guess we are spoilt in South Africa as we have amazing concept water parks (ironically developed by the same hotelier that developed Atlantis) and with this being Dubai I was expecting something over the top. We paid for Over the top and got okay. Fortunately, we are all 'water babies' and still had fun though."

Truly brillaint and amazing place.We are in dubai for 3 weeks with 2 young children, my son 3 years old and my daughter 10 months old, we have been looking forward to wild wadi from the moment we had been saving up for our dubai holiday over a year ago. It truly lived upto all the expectations and great reviews.Absolute amazing staff and level of customer service especially for those with young families and children.It was my wifes first time ever in a swimming enviroment and water park, the life jackets for all sizes from babies to large adults are great. As soon as you pay on entrance you are given a digital style watch/strap that you wear on your wristband, this can be loaded with money so you dont have to carry cash around and it used for payment for all types of things around the park, remaining balance is refunded at the end of the day.large lockers are 45 dhirams, small lockers are 35 dhirams, although we didnt actually use them as it was very safe and easy to leave your stuff on your loungers.Best thing to do is get there early as in winter months now it closes at 6pm, so to get the best loungers arrive early, we got there around 11 as my driving was a bit slow....lol but we still got good place to settle down.No food or drink allowed at all, yes you will be checked at security so please dont embarras yourself or the park staff, if you do have stuff they will keep it in special security areas, baby stuff was no problem.Towels can be hired but recommended to bring your own. You can easily spend whole day here as we did with the kids, there is something for everyone, the rides are amazing, lazy river nice and relaxed,jumeirah sceirah must be tried and absolute thrill.Some amazing views of the burj al arab, and if your a photo lover than there is hundreds of great places to take photos here.There are so many food places and drinks and juice bars all around the water park, just be prepared for that it is a bit expensive as is expected with any theme park attraction park like this so take this into account when budgeting your day, food is approx 45 dhirams to 60 dhirams per person around \u00a310 max for a very good sized deal or combo meal and everything else a lot less, ice creams around 10 dhirams so about \u00a31.80 which is a good price on average.We had such an amazing time here with some very unique memories that will last a lifetime and I just wish we could go back again, as im staying here for 3 weeks on self catering basis in an apartment and with the cost of a rental car and food shopping etc unfortunately our budget would not allow us to go again. The people who stay in any of the Jumeirah group hotels must be so lucky, as they get access to the park for free by staying in those hotels, unfortunately even those hotels are very much out our price range. It is our 4th wedding anniversary on december 13th and i had considered booking a jumeirah hotel for the night for my wife so we could get access to the park again but the prices are crazy, so if you are one of the lucky ones to be staying there please please do go and definitely enjoy this place.Thank you to all the staff, and thank you Wild Wadi, our best part of the holiday."

The two master-blaster slides [both very long it has to be said] are great fun - did them a lot of times. The lazy river that they all drop you into is very lazy, i.e. slow - just about everyone was jumping out of the donut rings and walking through the water. Do like the RFID wristbands that Wild Wadi use for admission / lockers / in park purchases. (If Aquaventure had this, it would be perfect). Just a word of warning - if you are male & go on the surfing rides, make sure your swim shorts are done up tight. Female guests are made to wear a cover-up top to avoid the risk of the surf wave whipping off their bikini / swimsuit top, rendering them topless, which would obviously offend in the UAE. We say a guy who was relieved of his swim shorts as his body was a bit too low below the surf board (yes, everyone watching did laugh)."

It is very conveniently located but this makes it very busy! The price is a little to high for me. There wasn't any where to sit. But it does have some good slides. If you are single or a couple you will have fun, just make sure to get there early. For families, I would say make the journey to RAK Iceland."

Only criticism is that after each slide down you end up in the slow paced lazy river style trench pool that most water parks have. Takes atleast 5 mins to get to a point where you can get out and go back to another ride."

We were not that interested in the slides/rides/etc. Spent most of the time with the kids in the wave pool, lazy rivers and water play area. Entry was BOGOF with Entertainer vouchers which gave us a healthy saving. We stayed there for approx 4 hours, arriving at 1 pm and leaving at 5 pm. Fed the kids before we arrived and therefore they only really needed snacks while we were there. Admission ticket and cash is uploaded to an electronic wristband which can be used to pay for any purchase in the park. Remaining money can be refunded at the end of the day. Prices of food and drinks seemed on a par with Western theme parks. Lots of staff, particularly lifeguards, etc. who were very helpful. There seem to be a lot of rides/slides/etc. for older guests but younger children are well catered for. Various photographers will take your photos but the prices of photos was exorbitant. Prayer room available in both male and female changing rooms.This place seemed more \"intimate\" than Aquaventure which we visited earlier in the year."

Firstly I would recommend that you purchase a Dubai Family Entertainer, in that you get two for one tickets for Wild Wadi so you nearly make your money back instantaneously and get vouchers for lots of other attractions and restaurants. I love Wild Wadi, its nicer if there are a few of you though, then you get to go on the 4 person rides and scream away together. :) The new ride, sceirah, is amazing when we started to queue I didn't know what we were getting on. As we reached the top 10 minutes or so later I saw we were queuing to step into a chamber where the floor below gives way. After nearly having a heart attack all ended in smiles at the bottom. Get to Wild Wadi as close to opening time as you can, it gets extremely busy in the afternoon so queue times go up. Food is excellent, though not cheap for what you get. You are given a band to wear around your wrist which you can put money on at the entrance, this is then scanned at all outlets and you are given a new balance. You then get a refund when leaving the park of the remaining balance. The fish foot eating experience is also a lot of fun, if you can tolerate the tickling sensation."

When buying your ticket it's very well explained what your buying, I.e electronic wrist band you can put money on so you don't have to carry cash around & what you don't spend gets returned to you once you've finished.Initially didn't think the signs for where the rides where very good, but then I realised that when you go on a ride it will lead onto the others! This was on the \"White water wadi (Master blaster)\", which connects to 11 other slides, so you can get off& join the other slides without going far. There was plenty of lounges around & the staff where all very pleasant & cheerful. The views where amazing from the higher points & the snacks etc where healthy with a wide range of fresh fruit & water. I did see a drinking water fountain near the entrance to the park, but that was the only one, which I thought was a shame, but maybe I wasn't being observant enough! Defenatly a 10/10 for this park, no queues, excellent staff & rides where excellent!"

I was really excited to do the rides after trying the one in Yas Waterworld now i want to see which one is better. The place was clean and organize. we started taking pictures. i tried slide number 1 and 4. it was perfect. however number 3 the so called Jumeriah Sceirah was breathtaking (yet fun). it was a nice experience but when my friends and I decided to try the Fisho massage i was really disappointed to see this one man (i dont know if what's his nationality) but he seems like Arabic. while my friends were freaking out and screaming because of those nibbling fish i couldnt take my eyes off from this guy standing infront of me. He was hell full of hickies/kiss mark on his leg and it look so annoying. I don't think Wild Wadi should tolerate this kind of staff, its not good to be seen by the guests. (especially kids).

We preferred Aquaventure but Wild Wadi had some fun rides. Pros - loved the Tantrum Alley and the big slide. The master blaster type slides were just okay for me but daughter enjoyed them. My husband really liked the flow rider. Cons - the park felt cramped compared to Aquaventure. Also the crowds were terrible. We got there a little after 10am and waited in line about 15 minutes. Almost all the chairs were taken. We changed and went to the flowrider first where my husband waited 10-15 minutes for a ride which lasted about 30 seconds. He wanted to do it again but later the lines were even longer. Next we went to the \"master blaster\" which has 11 slides (forget its name) and waited 30 minutes. The lines got longer after that - usually 45 minutes. So we spent a lot more time in lines than in the water. While there are towels to rent I think $10pp is pretty steep and would take towels the next time. Locker however is a must. If we were to return to Dubai we probably would not go back to Wild Wadi. It was fun but we did about everything there and as far as the ambiance of the park we preferred Aquaventure."

Wild Wadi just feels outdated and as if it has not adjusted to the growing number of tourists in Dubai. It is small, the water corridors are quite narrow resulting in major crowds in the water where you can never properly relax even in the \"lazy river\" because there are tons of people around you who push you aside, splash water, etc.There is a huge wait line for nearly every ride which sort of removes half of the fun.The changing rooms are quite spacious but I still can't believe there are just 4 toilets!The food is nothing exceptional and is quite expensive but at least the watermelon that you can get as a dessert is delicious.It was really quite a disappointing trip and it seems like the crowd is mostly of young guys who are quite disrespectful of personal space....I did not see many women and not even too many kids.As an overall, I think it is too expensive (275 DH) for what the water park is offering. If you have the choice - go to Aquaventure!"

The lifeguards are very alert and friendly, particularly on the ride where you get blasted up by powerful water jets. I would echo comments about safety that other posters have mentioned. I was on a double slide behind my son's and we came off the top of one slide at high speed. His float had not moved out of the way and we hit his with some force. The lifeguards looked a little overwhelmed as though too many people were on the ride. My tip would be to ask them to hold you back a bit and put more space between floats. It wasn't major enough for us to report it. I liked the cashless system and the changing rooms are okay. We'd come back and I'd recommend it as somewhere to go in Dubai. Bring plenty of sunscreen though!"

Good service, food was ok, better than at some other parks we've been too. The day we were there the park wasn't that crowded, but on a busy day we would have appreciated this even more. Well stocked shop.Many women dress conservatively here, so I would recommend women wear a rash shirt and board shorts rather than a bikini (also good for avoiding sunburn!)."

You are blasted up the hill by water jet, which makes for an exciting if not very comfortable experience. Highlight for us was the Flowrider - worth the relatively short wait and was great fun.Other top tips - take a towel (will cost you \u00a36 each to hire) and an empty water bottle - otherwise you will be in for a big cost hit.If you have done one of the USA waterparks then you will find that you can get round this in a couple of hours.

It's not a huge park, nor does it have quite as many rides as some water parks I have been to in the U.S., which is one reason why I can't give it five stars. The other reason is that it's pretty pricey considering that they only have a few slides that would be impressive to adults. Still, if you enjoy water parks like I do, you will have fun here. We arrived around 10 (when it opens to the public) and were able to walk right in with our printed voucher. There was no line to load money on to your wristband, and stashing our stuff in a locker took only a minute or two. Then it was on to the rides. The park wasn't busy in the morning so we were able to go on the Jumeirah Sceirah and the two other big water slides several times with not much wait, which was really nice. Take advantage of this while you can, because it definitely got busier as the day went on, and we ended up waiting 30 minutes or more for the best rides in the afternoon. They have a wave pool and a lazy river that were nice, but the lazy river was a bit TOO lazy. People kept abandoning their tubes so you would find the river clogged with tubes. It would be nice if the lifeguards cleared these out more efficiently. I do recommend going on the Jumeirah Sceirah. I've never seen a water slide with a trap door like that, and it was awesome, if a bit scary the first time. Definitely an adrenaline rush as the door latches shut behind you, you hear a voice counting down \"Three...Two...One...\" and then the trap door beneath your feet falls out from under you and you are hurtling down a water slide. It's not the absolute scariest water slide out there, but it is fun if you like tall water slides. I do wish there were more food options in the park, but we survived just fine. You load money onto your plastic wristband, which is very convenient since you don't want to be running back and forth to your locker to get your wallet all day long. I appreciated that the dress code was not strict at this park--plenty of bikinis and speedos right alongside women in abayas and Islamic swimwear. Anything goes, I guess! The staff were very friendly and, all in all, we had a great day. I just wish they would expand and add even more big water slides!"

If you stay in any jumeirah hotel it's free. It's perfect for families albeit the best rides are not for children. We braved the jumeirah scheirah! All I will say is don't expect to still have your trunks on at the end! The majority of rides are excellent, life guards everywhere and safety buoys for kids are plentiful. It's not cheap to eat and drink, but neither are hotels! It's a great day out, and if you go to Dubai in 35 degree heat, it's the best way to get a tan and stay relatively cool as your soaked all the time! Locker at \u00a35 is a rip off but necessary.

The only problem is during holiday season when it gets too crowded that you waste precious time queuing. The pool is cooled during summer, but the number of swimmers is relatively large. Recommended except in GCC countries school holidays. For ladies wearing Hijab Thursday night is ladies only. Also fare is expensive."

All the rides are signed to show how scary they are, and scariest of all is the Jumeirah Sceirah. By the time you get to the top of the tower to get into the pods to commence the ride, the tension is evident in the air. The staff prepare you very well for the ride - but it is very scary!!!! On the day we visited queues were very long which was a little frustrating, but we still managed to try out all the rides we wanted to. Allow at least half a day to try them all out.The staff were very proficient and life guards were evident on all the rides and patrolling around the park. They were very strict in enforcing park rules which was very reassuring. Sunglasses have to be removed for most of the rides, but are otherwise useful. I would recommend bringing your own towels, and flip flops for walking around in when you are not on a ride. We didn't eat at the park as we were staying at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel (thoroughly recommended), but there were plenty of food outlets, if a little expensive.The park and the rides are not very suitable for those using a wheelchair, and could be difficult for those pushing children around in a buggy. Overall for a middle aged couple we consider it an excellent experience."

With AED 205 each, I and my wife purchased an all day pass (till 1800 hrs since it was ladies night) to a wonderful aqua adventure experience. The park is cashless so you have to load whatever you might spend on a rubber wristband given at the entrance; the process is quite straight forward and unspent funds can be redeemed afterwards. Things are relatively expensive inside the park so come with your towel and swim suits else you rent a towel for AED 30. There are 11 rides & attractions, the scariest of these is the Jumeirah Sceirah (seriously, don't try this if you think you don't have the heart), the Juha's dhow & lagoon is exclusively for kids.Flowriders and flood rivers are fun. Lifeguards are always around to ensure safety. Wonderful experience"

From death defying drops to lazy pools to relax, I had a brilliant time exploring the park with family and friends.The water was extremely clean in all the pools/slides and a lot of lifeguards are stationed around the place. A few eating establishments around the place in case you get hungry which you can pay for with a wristband you are given at the start which you topped up with money. This is very handy so you don't need to bring your wallet out with you and keep it locked in your locker.The wave pool which is designed after a beach is very enjoyable, even for those who find it hard to swim as they provide life jackets for you to float around in. This water is warmer than the rest of the water around the park so you could just sun bathe on the shore.Please visit this park!"

Dubai is handsdown the hottest country I've visited and i'm African so I know hot.My inner child came out to play as I went trying all the rides one after the other. The Jumeirah sceirah ride was the scariest but it had the best rush ever-if u are into that kind of thing. The view of the Burj al Arab, Jumeirah beach n it's hotel are also mega pluses. However I'd advise you take your own flip flops,towels,sunscreens everything - you'd need them and they cost ridiculously. Pictures taken also cost a fortune so I'd advise group pictures so you can split the bill. Other than that I'd say it was totally AMAZEBALLS and I'd def do it again... and again.... and again!"

Lots of slides and choices for those that like action and speed and those that simply want to laze around a pool. We found the entry price very reasonable as were the food prices inside (sadly its mostly fast food based but it was ok). We caught a taxi here and back to our hotel (taxis are cheap, clean and you never have any issue). It did get rather crowded as we went on a Saturday. You can hire lockers to store your things and they use a system where you charge money to a wrist band. We hired a cabana for the day (which was expensive but worth it in our view). And you can get 8 in them so great to split with a couple of families or a larger group. They have covered sun beds, a fridge with cold towels and water and pool towels, and the staff will order and bring your food and other drinks from a menu (extra). It's in a secure location with easy access to the pools/slides. Best thing is, the most popular slide (slide 1) which links 11 slides around the park in one long ride you get priority access to it and skip any queues. As I say, worth every cent and didn't have to search for vacant spaces or sun lounges to relax and eat. We also went out onto the beach (had a pass if you stay with a Jumeirah Hotel) and a swim in the ocean was nice. Good to spend a day. Open every day and times vary depending on time of the year but about 10am to 7pm. Oh and you get great views of the Burj al Arab and Jumeriah Beach Hotel so bring a camera."

The rides are graded by how scary they are and then there is also the \"beach\" area where you can lounge or swim in the water, and the \"river\" which flows gently round the park. The waves in the river and the beach use to be quite vigorous and exciting but sadly they have toned them down in recent times. Probably the most spectacular and impressive water park I have ever been to (going to give Atlantis a visit next time though so this might change), partly because you don't just go down but on some of the rides you are carried uphill in the water too. However, it is really expensive- both to get in and to spend any money there. I would recommend timing your visit between meals because the food isn't even any good- standard fast food fare. Sometimes have to queue for 30mins for some of the rides but a really fun day out nonetheless. They are very efficient at the entrance so despite going on a very busy day we didn't have to queue to enter.Overall it is worth the cash because if you are reading this then it is probably not something you get to do every day."

Although we initially planned to arrive at opening, we had a slow start and after the drive from Al Ain arrived about two hours after opening. I expected to find a long line at entrance, difficulty finding available loungers and long lines at the rides as well. The first two did NOT happen and the lines for the rides were long, but not unbearable. Our only complaint was the number of older, hairy and potbellied men wearing Speedos. Of course, the park has no control over that, but it was uncomfortable for us with my 6yr old daughter constantly pointing and commenting. Surprisingly, though, there were not as many bikini-clad women to the dismay of my teen son, the birthday boy."

Wet n Wild on the Gold Coast is so much bigger and the waterslides so much better....They have two identical speedslides, with a trapdoor. Thats kinda fun. But the ride is not as high as others I have been on. There is two raft slides. One slightly more adventurous than the other. They were both good. Apart from that, there was just the slide river thingo that went around the outkirts of the park. It was OK, but not thrilling. I found the place boring, and left after 2 hours. Not enough variety. The park was very small. And I think the entry fee converted to about $70-$80 AUD - so its definately not cheap."

Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout which is an abiding memory of our trip and the rides were all very exciting. Felt it was relatively expensive for what it was worth, would expect it could get busy which would put a downer on a day and felt there was potential for a few more rides.

Great variety of rides, didn't go on the Jumeirah Sceirah but a member of my family did and said it was excellent. My favourite ride had to be Master Blasters - where jets propel you up a serious of different slides - a really different and exciting ride, I went on it three times! The longest we had to wait for a ride was 10 minutes, as the park was quiet (we arrvied at 10am), but as midday approached, the park understandably got busier. We paid 25AED for a refillable bottle for soft drinks, and you have to pay a further 5AED each time you want to refill it. Good selection of food outlets, although we only tried the snow cones (10AED each). Everything is paid for via a \"watch\" that is loaded with money and is scanned when you purchase something. Plenty of photographers throughout the park taking photos aswell but pricey.One problem we encountered on our day at Wild Wadi was a hydrant-type sprinkler which was on the high footpath just behind our sun loungers. It burst and water sprayed about 10 feet into the air, which soaked all of our towels and belongings. However, security came over instantly and we very helpful and reassuring, giving us new towels from the Jumeirah Beach hotel.We didn't go to Aquaventure in Atlantis, so I couldn't comment as to which waterpark is better - but Wild Wadi seems to be the better choice based on other reviews and what the locals say!"

We loved Atlantis but after going to Wild Wadi this year, there's no competition. Wild Wadi wins hands down. On the Monday we went to Wild Wadi, and on the Thursday we went to Atlantis. Me and my dad arrived at Wild Wadi at about 10am and was greeted by a very happy and friendly member of staff who explained to us how the lockers worked, where to get towels, how the wrist bands work etc. We then went straight for the rides. I absolutely loved all of them, particularly the water jets that send you uphill which was quite a strange sensation. I appogise that I don't know the names, but I loved the two large waterslides where 2-4 people can ride at once. The best ride, though, was the Jumeirah Sceirah. World class. Before coming to the waterpark, my father and I were concerned about burning our feet on the floor considering the heat outside in the summer (46C). Our fears were soon relieved as the management have obviously taken the heat into consideration which is more than what can be said for Atlantis. At Wild Wadi, they had a sprinkler system which kept the floor wet and therefore cool on your feet. At Atlantis, I have never felt so much pain in my life. They didn't bother to do anything.Thank you Wild Wadi!"

            "review": "Excellent fun, You cant miss this!. Let me start off by saying that this water park is just the best! Much better than the Atlantis (dont get me wrong Atlantis is still nice but thats another review Wild Wadi is like 100x more fun with more rides!!!). I went to Wild Wadi in August and I went on a friday as the park was open from 10am to 10pm but I think those times are for the summer only double check on their website before going because honestly you need at least a day to proper enjoy yourself here. The price is AED265 which is around \u00a350 and then a small locker is AED60 which is around \u00a310. Expensive yes. The food was lovely you can see from my pics what we had, I can't remember how much food was again but water was always between AED10-13 which is expensive, just be ready cause nothing inside is cheap. I remember reading reviews about no cash is allowed when paying for things inside the park thats a lie, you can bring cash with you but they also offer an option where they give you a wristband which can be loaded with money at the entrance so you can spend around the park each to their own really. No food or drinks are allowed to be brought inside the water park they will search your bags and remove those items so be warned.Where the photoshop is on the right hand side there are these stairs that will take you to the top where you will get an amazing view of the Burj Al Arab and take some great pics, there are sun beds up there so you can relax and enjoy the Dubai atmosphere. (amazing)There are rides for all age groups no doubt from thrilling rides to relaxing chilled ones. I found the water park very clean the staff was 5 stars so helpful one guy even went around the park with us all over to take pics for us that we then purchased in the photoshop with a cute Wild Wadi Frame. The staff really make this place so much fun. The Queuing up system is well done, it goes really fast just talk with family have a conversation and before you know it you'll be going on the ride. And for me I found that I couldn't walk around the park barefooted its just so hot the concrete floor next to the restaurants so have your flip flops at hand :) Its an amazing water park, go because honestly you wont be disappointed ! :)"

We love the big rings, at the back, you can fit 4-6 people on, and you really think you will go over the edge. The rings are fabulous, you jump on at the lazy river and catapulted up by a jet, then whirl up and down around the rides. So no climbing with rings up the stairs the jets do it all for you. We have been several times, the no thing hi need to queue for is the surfing, but ou are on holiday, so it's to a big deal."

Have been at Wild Wadi towards the end of school holidays with family and friends of my kids.Personally think that Wild Wadi is the best aqua park in the UAE, if you have younger children. Good location, attraction for every age, no long queues and enough space.Wild Wadi offers a variety from really thrilling rides to gentle streams and a great children water play area. With this Wild Wadi has the perfect balance. The wave rides are also very nice and exciting.There is no VIP access to the rides in Wild Wadi. I like this. Hence there is only one queue and not a queue for normal tickets and a queue for fast access / VIP ticket holders. Even normal tickets are expensive enough. Using vouchers from the Entertainer book is key if you do not go alone to Wild Wadi.I also like some other smaller points like covered free parking area, no long walk from parking to Wild Wadi, no long queues to get tickets or for the rides and a convenient drop-off zone for the family to name a few.There are only two downsides.- Hygiene is decreasing. One can see more people wearing street clothes in the pool. Should not happen but there are more and more people enjoying swimming in Wild Wadi in shorts and t-shirts or long skirts. Even worse there are babies with normal diapers splashing around in the child area. Pool attendants / life guards do not care.- Food as always: double price and half the quality of McDonalds with long waiting times."

Have just spent the day here at Wild Wadi Waterpark and it was great fun!Entry cost was around \u00a350 (AED265) which is a little pricey but considering what you get for your money, the location and the service it's well worth it my book.The park is very cleverly designed with a series of uphill slides which you can ride on up towards the bigger slides or just enjoy the ride as they're pretty rapid themselves with very powerful water jets sending you shooting up the slides on tubes or dinghies. There are also some bigger slide attractions which are AWESOME in comparison to waterparks in Europe!For cooling down there is a large chilled swimming/paddling/wave pool with lots of sunbeds etc and life vests everywhere for those who are not confident in water. It slopes in from a beach style entry to around 2m deep.Lots of stalls are dotted around which serve drinks, slushies, ice cream and such like.... Don't worry about cash getting wet, you are given a smart wristband which can be loaded with digital money at the entrance or one of the main shops! Very handy as you just swipe your wristband and voila :-)Overall, I'd have to say it's 9/10!"

            "review": "My top pick for UAE waterparks: a comparative review of all six. Which of the UAE waterparks is best? This is my opinion:1. Wild Wadi: has the best selection of rides in my opinion: the fastest, biggest thrill rides. Very compact park with a definite focus on the rides as opposed to general \u2018just being in water\u2019 experience. Enjoy sitting in your rubber ring and being shot up & down along the fun \u2018routes\u2019 as well as some great individual and group \u2018high thrill\u2019 rides. Must be older kids/adults to fully appreciate. 2. Aquaventure: a more beautiful park than Wild Wadi with a good selection of rides though a little tamer. Massive fish/shark tank with some rides based around this. Access to beach with gorgeous views is a bonus. Can easily spend the whole day here as there\u2019s enough to do. Suitable for all ages. We\u2019ve taken parents, pregnant friends and kids along to Aquaventure as there are gentler rides for them to enjoy. 3. Yas Waterworld: Yas has a cheesy theme running throughout the park (\u2018the legend of the lost pearl\u2019) but at least that keeps you entertained when queuing to get in. I'd say the rides are better than Wild Wadi and there is incredible attention to detail but what lets this park down are the enormous queues. You can supposedly jump these with a rather expensive VIP pass though I gather even then you will be queuing for some time. It's only been open since December 2012 so perhaps when the novelty wears off and it becomes a little quieter will it supersede Wild Wadi as top waterpark experience. A friend went on ladies\u2019 night which sounded chaotic: women with iPads arguing because attendants would not allow them on the flumes with them!4. Dreamland Aqua Park: if you have kids under 6 years old, this is your top pick with lots of child-friendly water play areas and water-based entertainment. No particularly innovative or thrill-seeking rides, but great for a young-family visit especially if a couple of the adults can escape every now again to explore the bigger rides. Head to one of the above parks if you have older kids/adults.5. Iceland: got a fun penguin theme running throughout the park. Some enjoyable and original rides but go with an even number of people as all the fun rides are geared to pairs. Park is a little hard to get around, especially in the summer heat when the water is also a bit too warm for comfort. Lots of boisterous lads splashing around. The park is strangely set around football pitches which remain full of lads all day. There was a weight limit of 80kg on one of the big rides and stewards were actively weighing people and turning them away. A minimum height 1.2m is enforced on a number of the rides so if you have daring but shorter kids, go elsewhere as they may be disappointed (a couple of cute girls were turned away but at least able to skip the queue to the ride next door)6. Wadi Adventure (Al Ain): great (but expensive!) for surfing, kayaking, water rafting. Has an \u2018air park\u2019 too. Need to specifically want to do these watersports as opposed to spend a fun family/friends day out. See my July 2012 review on this waterpark. We\u2019ve had a fun time at each waterpark for different reasons, but ultimately this is how I\u2019d rank them even though there\u2019s not much in it with the top 3. Expect queues at the top three parks on the weekends. Quieter during the weeks (Sunday - Thursdays) and during ramadan.Tip 1: Food is similar at all: deep fat fried cuisine. Make sure you credit your wristband at the entrance to save you from carrying around wet cash. Any unspent monies will be reimbursed at the kiosks or shops by the exits.Tip 2: SAVE CASH: With the Family Entertainer (395AED from supermarkets and book stores), you will get \u2018buy one get one free\u2019 vouchers for Aquaventure, Yas Waterworld, Wild Wadi and Dreamland. Considering entry is 225AED+ per adult, this is totally worth the investment, even if you are just visiting on holiday. Remember that the Entertainer itself will save you 100aed\u2019s on so many other attractions/restaurants/snacketarias.Tip 3: Take flip flops! The ground can get very hot especially in the summer months. All the rides have storage spaces for your footwear and even though you may need to detour a little to reunite yourself with your shoes, it will save your feet in the long run.Hope this helps you make a decision on which one(s) to go to!"

We stayed at Jumeirah Beach so had free access, one of the few plus points was the entry from the hotel via their private entrance - very short queues. However that was about it, we found the park small, sunbed areas cramped and dirty, queues were very long (over an hour for some rides), loud music causing a lot of UAE youngsters to be even louder and the park just felt shabby compared to Aquaventure. The lazy river was very poor and although there are advertised 30 rides, a lot of those are a number of rides chained together."

We went with our 7 year old son and he thought the whole day was 'awesome'!!We paid to get in and they gave you a wrist band which worked the lockers. You could also load money onto another wrist band which was a great idea as this meant that you didn't need to carry cash around with you or keep going back to the lockers for cash. If you had money left on it at the end of your trip it was refunded to you.It had a very good selection of rides and lots of lifeguards all over the place. There is a bit of refurbishment and building work going on which is not disruptive but sometimes the signage is a bit lacking!The height restriction is only 1.1m so our son could go on all the rides. Some of them were quite scary and I felt that they could be a bit much for some young children, despite being tall enough. However, our little boy loved them. We didn't go on the biggest ride, which he was tall enough for, as we found out that he would have to go on it on his own in a single 'ring' and thought perhaps that would be too much. Just a personal choice.There is not as much seating as at Atlantis but we still found somewhere to put our things.There are also plenty of places to get something to eat and drink.They have a lazy river for the unadventurous and a wave pool. There are life jackets of all sizes hanging up in various places so you can just help yourself.There are photographers all over the place and they take lots of photos and then attach white strips to your wrists. The photos are worth having a look at as some of them are quite good. One guy was in the wave pool and got our little boy to go under the water and he took lots of shots which came out really well. In the end we took all the photos that were taken of all of us and put them on a cd. It was \u00a350 which isn't cheap but if you get enough photos taken then it could be worth the money. We had a great day out and if we went back to Dubai we would definitely go back to Wild Wadi."

            "review": "Probably Timing. Hubby, I and 2 girls 18 and 19 staying in the Mina A Salam had free access to Wild Wadi, this being one of the reasons we decided to stay at Mina, we stayed right after Ramadam, from 11th August. Eid was in full force and the hotels were full, which meant the waterpark was very busy, it was also full of locals and residents outside of UAE who had extended holidays, it seemed like everyone was at this waterpark, it was full, you couldnt move in the very small lazy river, it was full of people and empty rings, not a very relaxing experience. There are 2 slides which you walk up a small incline to get there then you have to leave your sunglasses on a shelve, climb loads of steps to come down the slides, which were great fun, but as my glasses are prescription sunglasses I found it a bit of a hassle getting out at the end of the slide, cant see much and then going all the way back up the incline to pick up my glasses. I tried both slides and then avoided these slides. The other slides, pushed you up the slide first, great fun, but almost an hour queue, with no shade, I was dying by the time I got on the slide, did this once. The wave pool was the only clean part of the park, but the waves took forever to be turned on. To be honest we only visited twice because it was just not that interesting, not clean in places and packed. It was too small for the amount of people in there, a little old fashioned and in need of a refurb, we couldnt even find an empty sunbed. We did get free towels but had nowhere to put them, we ended up putting them on a wall and hey ho when we returned they had gone! it's a good job the hotels dont record how many towels you take in. This waterpark is no way in league with the Atlantis waterpark. Perhaps, if we were to visit at another time of year outside of school holidays and Eid it would be more attractive and pleasant experience. My girls said it was ok but too small and too much waiting in queues."

Apon arrival i bought my tickets from the counter outside (i had 2 for1 ticket from Entertainer book) was given a wrist band which also had money loaded on for food, drinks and locker rental. The wrist band is good as you dont need to carry money with you. Arriving early is a benefit as there are less waiting for rides. It was very hot when i went so regular sun cream application was essential. Food is more fast food with pizza, burgers and sandwiches available. Food bought as meal deals work out cheaper and each person can eat for \u00a36-\u00a37. Free water fountain are available around the park. The views from the waterpark are amazing as you can see a closeup of Jumeriah Beach, Jumeriah Beach Hotel and Burj Al Arab. Be sure to take a waterproof camera as pictures are expensive to buy. Also food and drink from outside is not allowed. Taxis are plentiful outside the park. A bus stop is also outside on the main road.Overall a good day out for children and adults. Arrive early when it is quiet and cooler."

For over 30 minutes while we went on rides and nothing went missing and we didn't even feel like it would go missing .great day out with the kids go and enjoy"

Best to go when it opens at 10am ti get to the rides without having to queue up for long.U can take the metro to mall of the emirates n then take a taxi frm there....abt 10dirhams thereabts taxi fare.Loved the \"rollercoaster\" series of waterslides where u r propelled by powerful water jets along a long series of slides around the park while u sit on a single tube.Had fun in the family rides, where 3-5 people can sit in a big float n slide down a series of water tubes.The wave pool was very cooling n we had fun soaking in the cold water on tht very hot afternoon.U can rent towels there too.Was told tht we cld get access to private beach nearby at a cost of 150dirhams! Looks like a great beach, very clean n clear waters.Foodwise a tad expensive but servings were generous. Tried their burger meals n nacho chips. Quite filling.Kids lived the mango sorbet! Really authentic n fresh!Changing room n toilets were clean.Lockers aplenty for rent.Even though it was a blistering hot day, the pathways were 'sprinkled' with water periodically by staff carrying huge bottled water containers. V thoughtful.After 12 noon, park got very crowded n long queues were common in all the rides.As we already had our fair share of the rides in the opening hour of the park, we just spent the day lazing ard by the wave pool n kids water playground."

Stayed at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel so had free access - this review is based upon not having to pay for entry.Best integrated water park I have been to - the rapids were mightily impressive allowing to travel almost the whole length of the park on elevated sections.Couple of 4 person rides, one of which was particularly scary - funnel type that is tilted so that it appears you are going to fall out onto the main road some 30m below (you have been warned !).The drop tunes had to be tried - quite extreme so I only had one go on those. You stand in a cylinder & the staff lock you in, then a 3-2-1 countdown & a trap door flies open & you go into freefall. Tube is completely enclosed so no danger of falling out.Kids loved the place, must have spent 3 half days & one full day here. On the full day paid for a Cabana - expensive but worth it in my view - very relaxing, waiter service & private entry / exit to the lazy river (which the rapid rides exit onto).Would definitely recommend - if having to pay entry would suggest early arrival & get a Cabana.Note/ Fri & Sat are late night - great fun to whiz around in the dark/reduced lighting on the rides...."

The park has a prime view of the Burj Arab, which set the scene beautifully. All slides end back in the lazy river, which was nice as you can go from one slide to the next without a queue. Loads of food available including fresh fruit and snow cones as well as more substantial food! The park has its own was of dealing with currency. Load all your cash on to a magnetic wrist band that you use to pay for things. This means your cash cant be stolen from your sunbeds when you go swimming nor do you have to fumble for cash whilst sopping wet. No charge for this and you can get back every penny you don't spend at the end. Great park, a trip to Dubai wouldn't be the same without it."

It's not as new as Aquaventure, but it's an excellent waterpark with a greater variety of slides. The pools are cooler (much needed on a July day) and the walkways are regularly watered down so you don't burn your feet. Plus, both admission and food at Wild Wadi is cheaper than Aquaventure.The payment system is better than Aquaventure. You are issued a wristband which serves as your locker key (if you rent one). You can also load it with money to use for food throughout the day. It's nice not to have to carry (and potentially lose) wet money.Finally, bring your camera! You can lock it in the locker when you're not using it. You can get the best photos of the Burj al Arab from the rear of the park.

I heard that there was one in Atlantis that was similarly priced but bigger. We kind of felt hard done by in terms of price and of course, the extra bit for the locker.However, the day itself ends up being fun if you spend half in the pool, a few on rides and get something to eat. Food isn't expensive at all and is tasty! My favourite ride was the family slide which makes you feel like you're about to fall off the edge into the streets of Dubai. Such a good ride and I also liked every other ride in the park as well. My company were too scared to go on the Sceira ride but it looked awesome and I regret not going. Not recommended for those with back pain, I hear. The swimming pool is a great relief from the hot floors and tiring queue lines. The day we went, the queues moved super fast and it was busy as well! I'd recommend WW as a good day out but you might be better off spending your day at another waterpark if you want to get more for your money. I just wanted to say a huge thanks to one of the team members (whose name I cannot remember, oriental male) who made the effort to somehow find us half way through our day just to tell us that we forgot to take our change when paying for tickets. It was around 100DHS which we had forgotten about! However, it was so kind of him to find us and give the money back. Applaud the service.Shame about the price, but good day out for families and friends."

On arrival, we loaded money onto our wristbands (fab idea) and purchased a small locker for 30 dirhams, non-refundable but well worth the money.The layout of the park is really good and it's great that you can come off the majority of the slides and can stay in your rubber ring and join the lazy river!We decided to do the fish foot spa, it was 50 dirhams per person and a really fun experience.There was a good choice of rides for everyone, we are both in our early 20s and found the rides great fun, especially the ones labelled \"intense thrill\"!When we return to Dubai next year we will definitely spend another day here and have already recommended it to others."

The park's set up is good and the slides are great. Love the wrist band idea where you don't need cash as long as you have pre-loaded your wrist band on entry. They is not many rides/slides but what they have will not disappoint. All staff that we came in to contact with were polite and most helpful. The only negative comment I would make is regarding the walk from each ride. Be prepared to have the soles of your feet burnt. The walkways are not well covered and are not adequately cooled."

We climbed to the top to do the Jumeirah sceira twice but didn't quite have the courage to follow through but next time !!! Tantrum Alley is awesome with lots of O M G moments. It's hot and there r queues but that's life and everyone is having a great time. One thing take in wet shoes if you have them as the concrete gets hot.

We met a couple on a tour who gave us their vouchers from the Dubai entertainment book (get if spending a week in Dubai) so got a buy one get one in for free deal. You can also rent lockers and towels for a cost. We did not eat at the park so not sure on the prices. Maybe take your own water as we did.When you rent a locker (at entrance/ticket gate) you get plastic armband, much better than Australian ones (also used for photos in gift shop). However the lockers are located in male and female change rooms not in a neutral area. You can get big or small lockers also.There are 3 thrill rides with tubes that you do not have to bring with you up stairs like other parks. There is also a tube ride that goes for about 30min. This ride takes you around half the park up and down water jet slides, hills and eventually to their slow lagoon ride. Best ride of park. There is also a kids area, wave pool (nice and cold) and a wave ride (Pay for).You can not wear thongs on rides but there are unsecured places to place them if you want (the ground can burn your feet). You can not wear sunglasses on rides (even though the sun is blinding). There are allot of signs about line cutting so be aware it is a general practice of the locals. Note the park is open till 12 midnight some nightsSo if you dont like the heat of the day maybe go then. However im sure that is when most of the locals go. Also Fridays are ladies night. So check they might not let men in."

It is so well organized, super clean and so easy to navigate.You can put your things in a locker which are dotted around the park. You can then buy a bracelet where you can electronically out cash onto via any of the kiosks. This way you don't have to carry anything with you for the day and can buy drinks, foods, souvenirs as you go. If you don't spend all your money, you just get it refunded at the end of the day. Brilliant!The water park is fun for all ages. My husband spent the day going down the \"vertical\" slides and tried his hand at surfing. My son and I stayed in the wave pool, went on a tube along the river and played in the enormous water playground. We arrived at 10am and only left at 230pm because we had another tour booked. Otherwise we could have stayed there for hours more. Also, if you stay in one of the Jumeirah chain hotels, you get free entry and transfers to the park. We stayed at Jumeirah Creekside ( see my separate review) and had free entry, mini bus transfer and towels included. A great day out for all ages."

Tip No. 1, perhaps leave your towells at the hotel and do WW in bursts to avoid paying for a locker (not that it was overly expensive). It takes a while to get the hang of the park's geography. There are really only 4 or 5 rides/ride entrances and the rest is pools, kids water area, snack bars etc. Tip 2. If you do the tube rides as a double you avoid going backwards which can be slightly disconcerting. It was lots of fun and although nowhere near as big as the waterparks we have back home, we all enjoyed it immensely."

He wave pool is a good attraction for them also. Feels like the distance between each slide takes forever to walk and remember the whole time you are not covered by the shade, so burning is more possible here - remember your sun cream. I think for older children its great but if you have under 4's or under 1.1m in height, I think it's limited. Didn't eat here but certainly there was a vast election of eateries. "

Food and drink (including icy slices of watermelon) are easily accessible and there are many shady spots. There are many lifeguards and service staff scattered all over the theme park to monitor the safety of guests and oversee the various rides and activities. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. My 6-year old loved the kids play area and there are slides suitable for kids aged 3 to 12. Parents/guardians can enter and enjoy the slides together with the younger kids, and there are lifeguards stationed at the entrances to the play area of and at every slide to oversee safe play so I felt comfortable leaving her to play by herself.

Based on my experience I'd recommend:1. Set aside at least half a day, preferably pre lunch hours. 2. Put some credit (around 50 AED per person in your party) into the wrist strap for later use on food and drinks. 3. Pay extra for the large locker. 4. Begin your rides with the Burj Surj if you are a family with kids and try Tantrum Alley later. "

We had free passes as we were staying at one of the jumeirah chain hotels and were fast tracked through the queue which was great as it was very hot, although the queue seemed to be short and moving along quickly at 11am when we arrived. The park is big, but not so big you get lost. The rides are great, the lazy rivers and the interconnecting slides are good, the craziest of the rides has got to be the jumeirah scheirah! Absolutely nuts! There are plenty of sun loungers with plenty of umbrellas to get you out of the sun. The flooring gets very hot as your walking round the park to the rides, the yellowy orange surface gets super hot, whereas the light coloured rough surface is OK. We stayed from 11 till about 4 and managed to deal with the heat and sun, both of which were plentiful! Drinks from the catering outlets were reasonable, we didn't buy food so don't know on that score."

We had a fun day although I enjoyed water parks elsewhere a little better (Atlantis in the Bahamas and Waterbom park in Bali). I am not sure what the aquaventure park is like at the Atlantis in Dubai but I would like o see that next time. Wild wadi was definitely a fun day out, there are a lot of canal type lagoons around the park which you get on to at various points which were not working throughout the day, apparently when larger people get on it it sometimes gets stuck, so we spent a bit of time waiting for these. There are two slides where you go on with 4 people and they are really fun, also two slides with a scary drop which are also fun (you get put into a glass box and the floor drops out from underneath you). The surf machines were also fun to watch. The park is easy to get around as it is not that big and is a fun thing to do in Dubai as it is just so hot. Price wasn't too bad, around 220 dirhams which is around $60 Australian dollars."

However, if you have time to go to both, do it. Although Atlantis is a nicer park and the experience of going out over the man-made islands out to the resort is very cool too, Wild Wadi had a better assortment of rides. Based on rides alone, WW is better (and although the entry fees are about the same, WW is cheaper once you factor in food etc and the cost to ride the monorail out to Atlantis)."

This was the first time I had taken my family so had to pay entry for 4, we had two vouchers to gain entry for the price of 2 which brought the admission down and we credited 200 dhms to our account for food and drink. This got us 4 drinks and 4 basic meals just. Your not allowed to take and of your own food and drink into the facility but there are water fountains to get access to drinking water. Get there early before opening to ensure a good sun lounger location. Overall the kids loved it I still love it but be aware of the costs. We stayed there happily from 10 am till closing at 7. Still a great place and a must do when in dubai. Free parking at the entrance is also a great advantage."

We've had a great day at wild wadi!The entry isn't cheap, so I'd recommend using the entertainer vouchers you can buy in most supermarkets here and benefit from their two for one entry offer. At close on \u00a340 per person it's not cheap, and you'll get little change for \u00a310 for lunch per person.That said, it's brilliant fun and well worth it. The rides are all great and quite unique, in that they force you up hill with water jets that are so strong you'll need to make sure you've got you swimming shots tied on tightly!!They cater for all ages and the staff couldn't be more helpful if they tried.There's a life guard at every corner and parents with young children should feel safe in the knowledge that kids are in very safe hands.There's lots of shaded areas to find cover form the sun in the summer months and cabanas for those that want to splash out.I'd highly recommend it for a family day out. Brilliant fun!!"

It surpasses all of the Florida waterparks by a long shot and whilst small, is packed full of attractions.The White Water Wadi Master Blaster slides are excellent and have a fast moving line due to their high capacity, and propel you all over the park, even working as transport if you wish to get around. The new raft slides are fantastic and well worth the climb up the stairs.Staff are excellent and the range of food options is great for the size of the park, providing healthy options in the form of fruit smoothies and mixed fruit boxes/salads. We did not pay for entry as a Jumeirah hotel guest, so I cannot comment on the pricing, but the park is a must see in Dubai, even if you are staying at Atlantis which has its own waterpark."

She was not allowed on Aquadventure in Atlantis!!! They give you the float at the beginning of the ride and you do not need to lug it around like at Aquadventure. The children's play area was lovely for small kids. It gets very busy so go early. Be careful as some nights it closes early."

Hint: only hire one locker to leave valuables in and take your own towels to save money. Walked straight in, helpful guy advised us where to go for good sun beds by wave pool and how to navigate round the park. As a family with a 13 year old not very brave girl and 10 year ' I'll try anything' boy this was the park for us. Started off on the 2 raft rides - burj surj and tantrum alley, great fun as all together in one raft and full of surprises. Then onto the master blasters which shoot you up and down all around the park and connect with different slides. This can be done in double rafts or singles. We went all the way round in both and advise single for the adrenalin rush. Time for the Jumeirah Sceirah which was braved by the 10 yr old. Stand in a pod, floor drops away and off you go. SCREAM! Our aim was to hit it and by 12.15 we had done the raft rides 3x each and been all around the park 3 times without queuing for more than a couple of minutes for anything. Stopped for lunch Hint: we had 2 supersize meals at 49 aed each which was sufficient for us to share as a family. Then fun in the wave pool and a play in the kiddies area and left by 2pm. By lunchtime the queues were starting for everything but we had done it all. This water park does not have the widest variety of rides but for family fun I prefer it over the Atlantis. The views over Dubai are amazing too - an added bonus."

There is a good variety of rides, but the main reason is the layout of the park with the children's play area very central makes it easy to have a base camp there and the larger children can roam free around the park and they always pass by now and then. The park is also very well run and over the years they have ironed out most of the things we find annoying in the some of the other parks, for example stupid queue systems. Even on days with lots of people, most things run relatively smooth. It is also well maintained and clean. Even the fast food is ok, although some people will find it a bit pricey.Our children (age 3,7 and 10) will pick Wild Wadi every time if they are given a choice. It's simply an excellent day out, but watch out for the crowds on big weekends or arrive early so you can beat them to the main attractions."

We would have thought that cost could have been included in the entry fee.Notwithstanding that it is important to get there early during hot weather because it does fill up later in the day which can mean waiting for some of the slides. Try to avoid the weekend days of Thursday - Saturday when all locals have time off.For smaller children smaller than 1.0m there is only one dedicated slide area, as well as \"beach type\" area, for everyone else it is simply a matter of how courageous you want to be.The Jumeirah Sceirah is probably the highlight but it is all over very quickly.Hint for those who have difficulty climbing, or perhaps afraid of heights, the 3 best rides all require substantial stair climbing."

We have been to many water parks in Europe and this was by far and away the best water park we have ever been to. We loved the experience of the white water rapid type slides. The water park is very well organised and there was no excessive queueing. The cashless system made the experience even better. If you are looking for a great way to spend a day while in Dubai we highly recommend going here and we will definately be back. Suzanne and Kieran"

After speaking to many people, we were advised to go to Wild Wadi as opposed to the other water park near the Atlantis.It was a really fun day (2 adults and 2 children). Glad we went on a Sunday - try and avoid Fri/Sat which is the weekend in Dubai - its a lot more crowded. We didn't have to line up long for any rides. Also turned out a perfect weather day to go - not too hot.Tips: Get some money loaded onto yr wristband - min AED30.00 each person for some lunch. Get a large locker - the small ones fit hardly anything. Make sure you are completely dry before trying to catch a taxi back to hotel - our driver wasn't going to let us in unless we were!"

Gets overcrowded in peak times, with insufficient sunbeds but this is the only major disadvantage. Food selection in food courts is fast food style, but this is acceptable in this type of venue.

The food is ok and reasonably priced and cheaper than at Yas Waterworld and Atlantis. We went on a cloudy but warm day so the park was not over crowded. The entry was quick and we got sunbeds in a nice area. The only downside was that the water was not heated anymore and was rather cold as sompared to the other two parks we visited during our trip to Dubai. There is also no possibility to purchase tickets for a follow up day with lower price. I also have to note that I tried buying tickets online from home in order to get the advertised discount but unfortunatelly it did not work for some reason. Anyway I would return again when in Dubai next time but I hope the water will be warm then."

Having been going to this park for the past 11 years, the value and the experience never diminishes ... even though the Atlantis park (its closest competitor) may seem more glamorous, this is the best park when it comes to thrills and that is for all ages!"

We purchased the Dubai entertainment book for $40 AUD and this park alone saved us $120 AUD, and the book has hundreds of eating outlets and things to do while in Dubai. If you are a daredevil (like me) then go on the Jumerai sceirah which is a 30 metre high water ride where you are dropped into the ride and slide on your back at high speed.

A pizza and pepsi is round 50 dirhams. They operate on a cashless system whereby cash is loaded onto a watch and all payments are deducted accordingly.

This is the second time I have visited Wild Wadi (the first being nearly 2 years ago, my husband has been 6 times), we visited here but this time with our 2 teenage girls on Good Friday, the day before we had gone to the Atlantis Waterpark. This waterpark is so much better than the Atlantis, we arrived and went straight through. Bearing in mind our previous visit (we had stayed at the jumeirah beach hotel which was free access to the waterpark so we didn't take towels as we were given them last time as part of the access), this time though they weren't included so I dont know if thats because we were residents or not, anyway, we had to either hire them or buy them. For AED30 you could hire them or for AED45 you could buy them... we bought them. The cashier asked us about the meal deal which was something like 40% cheaper if you bought it on entrance so we did but in hindsight we shouldn't have because this entitled you to only certain meals (this consisted of a burger, chips, side salad, melon and drink - a bit too much food when you are in a waterpark to be honest). Also once you had purchased your meal deal/locker/towels you are given a plastic watch which is credited with the money so you dont have the trouble of having to carry cash around with you, which is not good when you are in a waterpark (certain parts of the Atlantis food/drinks kiosks you have to pay in cash). There is also free water fountains here at Wild Wadi which is a nice touch.This place just seemed so better organised that it made it throughly more enjoyed. Even the queues for the rides seemed quicker. You generally got to a sign that said 15 minutes wait from here and it was no where near that.Since we went nearly 2 years ago the Jumeirah Scerah has changed, it is now enclosed and you climb into a box and there is a countdown until the \"trap door\" opens. There are so many photographers scattered around the place but unfortunately they are very very expensive (3 photos and a USB for I think it was around AED650 or if you didnt want the Wild Wadi picture frame you paid about AED120 for one). If they made the pictures cheaper it would be a whole lot better.Its not the newest water park in Dubai but in my opinion its the best and I will definitely be back."

There were four-person max. rides that were very child-friendly, while at the same time thrill-inducing for everyone else. You are eligible to ride every single water ride at the park, as long as you're 1.1m tall! ;) Don't worry, there's a measuring station for the little ones at the entrance. I enjoyed the rides, and there were frequent little ice cream stands, and several places to dine - but no one comes to water parks for the food! One thing I found helpful which I hadn't seen at a water park before was hot chocolate! Hot chocolate is the perfect thing to warm you up after another swim/water ride at around 5pm, which was sold at all of the kiosks at the park. There were a total of 11 rides - not too many to get lost in, but not too little to get bored of, which I appreciated. Although if you have older kids that want more, wilder rides, the Atlantis would likely be the better option, Wild Wadi is definitely a good deal smaller, easier to navigate, less overwhelming, and better for younger children!"

If you can cope with being pushed out of the way by Russians continuously then you will probably enjoy it. However, manners of many take a lot to be desired! The lazy ride round the entire park is not as good as the Atlantis. I would say in all the rides are better than the Atlantis. Security and safety seemed to be going pretty well I would say on average there are more lifeguards than there are at the Atlantis. However, there are far too many empty rings going around and around which get in the way. The food is pretty bad but if you like hot dogs then you will love it. All in all, it's a great family day out but with some simple and straightforward improvements from the management, things could be improved considerably. I love Dubai and I've lived there for many years previously. For me if I were to go back to a waterpark I would go the extra mile or two and go to The Atlantis."

The double rafts are supposed to have a closed bottom for kids to fit in safely. Unfortunately they are all broken. I was holding my daughter with my knees, a lifeguard forced me to keep my daughter sitting on my feet instead, this was apparently the decision of the \"safety commission\" of the park, rather than buying proper rafts.The raft was poorly inflated and on the tallest corner my daughter bounced off. There are no protective nets and she skid along the edge of the 60 ft fall on the verge of falling off. I could not stop the raft and was about to run her over when finally I managed to get off it and head first had some level of control. The water jets propelling the rafts upstream were not switched off and the little girl tumbled helplessly up the slide among shouts of terror. When she finally reached one of the intermediate pools the lifeguard did not notice. I was right behind and brought her up. She is a good swimmer, but paralysed by panic could not get out of the water. I am young and fit, my girl is a good swimmer. I was cautious on the ride and followed the WRONG safety instructions I was given. . I practice extreme sports and I am not easily scared. This time I was petrified and can only thank god to have my little girl peacefully sleeping here with me. The park management will respond and blame the lifeguard, mind you other guards and the supervisor told me that as a remedy to the broken double rafts the \"sit on dad's feet\" safety position had to be adopted. They will present their outstanding safety record, but are you willing to risk your kid's life for a slide?I have been to the park before and know for a fact that the kid's rafts used to be there, few in numbers, many broken, but some used to be available. I looked long for the kids rafts, asked the life guards but none exist anymore.I got lucky once I won't try again. In short: don't do it to your kids!"

I also floated along the lazy river and went on an intense waterslide on a raft. The other things I liked about the water park were the wave pool that was pleasant enough to swim in; the sun lounger area where we got incredible views of the Burj Al Arab, the wave pool and Jumeirah Beach Hotel; the wristbands where money could be added and used to buy anything around the water park from souvenirs to generous servings of watermelon; and the cleanliness and the privacy of the changing room. Some of the slides were hard to find initially, but I got there in the end. Overall, Wild Wadi is a decent place to have fun whilst staying in Dubai. 4/5."

Well except for e mega high one which still, to my disbelief I went down. It was scarey and exhilarating.....and one I won't do again!It's an all day thing for the whole family, there's lots of places to lay on sunbeds if you just want to watch, food is available and good changing areas and showers. Definately an all day funday that I would highly recommend."

My only complaint is that at the end of some slides, you arrive too fast and end up slamming your feet into the walls - some walls aren't padded and I did get a few scratches on my legs and feet. Another thing that could definitely be improved are the locker rooms - they're grotty, look dirty and smell. Other than that Wild Wadi is great fun for all ages. I've been on both my visits to Dubai."

One hour in to our long awaited trip to the water park the visit came to a grinding halt when my daughters 10 & 8 were suspended halfway up a water powered flume because the water had been turned off as a young boy above them had fallen out of his rubber ring. I was still waiting in the holding pool at the bottom of the slide.The resulting action by the \u201cLife Guard\u201d was to deploy a piece of wood across the entrance to the slide preventing the queuing people behind (which included me) from accessing the entrance. Next the life guard walked up the slide to escort my daughters to the bottom. She then started to panic and asked the resident photographer what she should do. She then asked my eldest daughter to climb over the partition which involved climbing over the now installed piece of wood which we were to subsequently find was raged along its edge. As my 10 year old tried to climb over the obstruction I realised there was a height difference between the level of the bottom of the slide and the floor of the holding pool - but by then it was too late. She slipped coming down hard onto the edge of the wood. I helped her over as she was by now in floods of tears and shaking uncontrollably. A French guest waiting in the holding pool next to me informed me \u201cshe has blood coming from her bikini.\u201d The guard by now seemed even more disorganised and bewildered than before not knowing what to do as the whole catalogue of events unfolded. We received no attention from this or any other members of staff. I then escorted my daughter now in shock back to our sun beds to meet my husband and collect our belongings, I now realised my daughter was bleeding internally. We organised our own return to the Al Qasr. The nature of the injury meant for the following few days my daughter could not swim or walk any distance as the wound was open and she sustained bruising around her crouch. Although the number of guards at Wild Wadi seemed adequate this incident can only ask if the training and strategies employed to deal with such incidents are adequate. This will not deter us from holidaying again in Jumeriah but next time we will not be visiting Wild Wadi"

But, my husband and I took our two kids (aged 4 and 5 and a half and learning to swim) and we had a blast!We stuck to the attractions that were suitable for their ages - we started out at Juha's Journey. The staff were professional, if a bit brisk and my butt was numb from being in the somewhat cool water but it was a nice float around the \"river\" in our large doughnut floaters. Juha's Dhow and Lagoon was a hit with me and my kids - we spent hours on the slides, being water-dumped and screaming like banshees each time!A piece of advice: rent extra towels for the kids - it tends to get chilly and their teeth start to chatter from the cold!I would have rated Wild Wadi excellent but for the fact that the toilets are in one location only - at the entrance. I had to make the long trip to the toilets twice, scurrying along with my toddler doing a skip, hop and dance all the way and with both of us yelling \"hold it! hold it\" all the way!"

Wild Wadi is a smaller version of the same kind of water park theme. It is definitely more small children friendly with lots of rides and activities geared towards the younger children too. The surfing looks super fun. The only negative that I have for the place is the use of wristwatch type of bands when entering the water park. They are not the most cleverest of designs. My son went on one of the slides and the wristband got stuck to something on the way down scraping his wrist. Not a big injury but still for a child its a huge issue. My word of warning...once in, take the wristbands out and keep them safe till you have to hand it back to the staff before leaving the waterpark."

Very small and tighly-packed territory - you're constantly risking to run into someone but struggling to find a start point for slides3. The park claims to have over 20 slides however they are not separate attractions but just a few sequences of slides - means there are only a couple of entrances to the slides - you can easily wait for 40 minutes for just ONE RIDE (long one but still - only 1 ride!)4. After your long ride you finish on a completely different side of the park and you have to go long way to find you slippers (walking barefoot is not comfortable)5. Very few sun-loungers/chairs - hard to find a spare one6. Overall - very, very crowded even outside of weekendA few things which were good:1. Bracelet cash system (but it becomes industry standard already)2. Personnel is extremely polite and helpfulHowever - again - I would not recommend this waterpark. I've visited waterparks in 5 countries - Czech, Egypt, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia - but Wild Wadi was the worst of all."

By the way, when are 5 star venues going to realize that spaghetti with tomato sauce does not constitute the \"healthy\" kids option? But as with all similar theme parks you are stuck with this, because you are not allowed to bring in any of your own food or drink.

The lines start at the ticket booth and continue from ride to ride. I think in 7h we only got 7 rides in (and then 1h for lunch). While the park claims to have over 30 rides, it is actually much less, but i.e. ride #1 is described to combine 11 rides (it has 11 rapids, each has its own name, hence they get to over 30) ... but nothing much to complain about it. This way you only line up once. In the end I would say the most fun ride was the Jumeirah Sceirah (nearly free-fall), but you line up 30 minutes for a 45 second slide. I was positively surprised that the lunch options were not a total rip off (other theme parks take note, I am especially looking at you Disney). The cashless payment system is also nice. They ask you at the entrance how much you want to put on that, before you have any clue how much things are. But worry not, what is left on your wristband can later be refunded.Highly recommended!"

It is very small by comparison to others we have visited and it is heaving with people. We attempted to visit twice at different times before actually going in at different times but sheer numbers of visitors seems pretty constant and there appears to be no better time to go than another. There seems to be little control over numbers allowed in and there are long queues for the few rides there are and for example, you are not allowed to spend longer than one minute on the flow rider. It is very expensive too at 225 Dirhams per person (approx. \u00a340 each). Staff were helpful and plentiful though."

Plenty of opportunities there, from soft and lazy floating in channels, towards the Jumeirah Sceirah where you almost vertically fall when the ground under your feet opens, and you reach dizzying speeds. In between you have long rides around the park in a system of boosters pushing you up, before coming down further. Also possibility to practice surf simulator, or some other more thrilling rides, unless you prefer to go to the wave pool. Having a chair close to it is almost impossible, but there are many other places, and overall you can stay quite protected from the sun if you want. Once inside some of the food comes at quite inflated prices, and the pictures definitely are priced outrageously high. But the kids enjoyed every minute of it, day after day..."

A compact venue compared with Atlantis water park but more fun. Great the way you start some of the rides at the bottom where their poweful water jets fire you on your ring to the various stages and eventually to the top. There are then several choices on the way down as you wind through tunnels and round tight turns. The larger more exciting 2 - 4 man rides are well worth the climb up the stairs and once done, you will be wanting to go again. Only downside is that these rides can get busy by late morning onwards so well worth doing early. Plenty of sun loungers so you should always have a place to park yourself, lockers are available if you need one and they have a clever system by which you can have money added to your wrist band that you can then pay for drinks and food; saves carrying money. The food choice is also good and the various eating places have different choices all of which are good value for money given you are a captive audience (no food or drink allowed to be brought in, even your water will be taken off you on arrival so be warned). My friends and family always want to go to Wild Wadi every time they return; they always comment just how friendly the staff are, they do make you welcome and have an excellent attitude."

The flumes are impossible to count, and each one more fun than the next. My favourite was Wild Wadi's take on the classic rubber ring flume - except this onw has jets of water to fire you UP the flume instead of down! Genius! There is something for everyone; from those just looking to sunbathe to the wary and the most adventurous! An absolute must for any Dubai tourist"

The place is spotlessly clean, the staff and life guards are very helpful, friendly and smiling and the rides are great and in some cases (Jemeriah Scarer) scary! There are also additional attractions such as the Flowriders which were superb. On entry you are given a watch like tag which you can also load with cash to buy food etc (worth doing this and you can also get any money not used back at the end of the day). It is also used for tagging you when they take photos of you so that on exit your photos are readily available. We paid a ludicrous price for entry (dhs900!!!!) for family of 4 but TOP TIP if not with hotel or tour group you can use Groupon vouchers and get 45% off - so book this in advance - which makes it a very good price !!"

The tubes are good but they seem to have no limits on guest numbers at this place - they just keep letting them in and taking the money - to hell with the queue lengths you have to wait in to use the rides, you're not coming back anyway and we've got your money - keep letting more in !"

Yes, make sure you have 2 for 1 vouchers (assuming there is 2 of you) or this will set you back about \u00a355 (when time of visit). This is NOT a big water park. You will not need more than about 2 hours here to do all the rides that appeal to you - because not all rides will appeal to everybody. Very pleasant to walk around, and like just about all Dubai, spotless and litter free. Actually the changing area was a little on the dingy side. But there is one thing you MUST be aware of. The park is NOT very near a metro station and if you leave near closing time, as a lot of people do, you could wait in a long queue for a long time (up to an hour) for a taxi. So pleasant enough for a few hours, not near closing time, but very expensive if you don't have 2 for 1 vouchers. Oh, and Tripadvisor asks you to categorise who was on this visit, so I got as close as I could, but daughter left her teenage years a few years ago."

The force tipped me over a couple of times.My son and I enjoyed the new Tantrum Alley & Burj Surj slides. Tantrum Alley is a \"extreme thrill\" slide with a combination of 3 tornados, tackled in a cross shapped ring; while the slightly gentler Burj Surj has 2 bowls in a circular raft.All in all a nice day out.

If you want to get out and about in Dubai but are afraid of the heat but want to please the kids (and also yourself), go to Wild Wadi Water Park. This water park, which is extremely compact and navigable, is on the Jumeirah property, right outside the gate of the Burj al Arab and next to the Jumeirah Beach Resort. If you are a guest at the Burj, admission is free, but in any event, it is probably not that expensive and is sure worth it. On the premises there is a snack bar and they also sell sunscreen, flip flops and all of the essentials to have a good time. There are a couple of inner tube water slides, a kid's water complex with smaller slides, wading pools and water which falls out of pails and shoots from water guns. I find that it is best to go after 4:00 pm when the heat is more manageable and will be the perfect way to refresh yourself and cap off a hot day in Dubai."

The single/couple tubes would go all round the park through tunnels and bridges and end in a ring shaped pool covering the entire length of the park where you can swim around. The good thing about the tubes was you didn't have to climb a million stairs for a few seconds of adventure.The huge and adventurous drop ride was a joy but i couldn't bare climbing the stairts again but definitely worth a try atleast once.The park has a good locker/storage facility and separate changing areas for men and women.ps. If you search around enough online before going to the park, you might find a few good deals. i found myself a good 25% discount :)"

Thumbs up to the food and drink available and it's a nice waterpark. But the rides are limited making the queues large and waiting around in the Dubai heat is not tons of fun. The wave pool is the tamest wave pool I have ever been in. The thing is, a lot of the locals can't swim and so they have to make the waves milder than they would in Europe or the USA. Most local adults wore safety vests in the wave pool. It's water you can stand up in and when the waves hit, they all scream 'whoooooo, whoooooooo'. Crazy times.We had a nice relaxing day. The place needs more rides. It's ok. Go to Disney. Even Centerparcs in the UK is on a par with this."

There are life guards in the water strategically placed so if you do come into difficulty helo is at hand. There were shoot up slides which were fantastic and lifeguards at the top, also there was a 6 person rubber ring ride which was great fun! The wave pool is rough so unless you are a confident strong swimmer dont venture into the deep water. Queuing for the slides doesnt take too long and is always shaded which is a bonus, also they have sprinklers which are activated periodically so you never overheat when you are out of the water. There are free lockers available for items of clothing and plenty of food outlets. Would highly recommend, fun day out for all ages!"

In addition, there are several snack stands as well, from where the guests can pick up items for their munching."

Pluses: Fun for every one, variety, plenty of space, well organised, lots of life guards at every stageMinuses: Over pricedWhile planing we took care of the following- AND this made our visit very memorable.(a) Arrived at the park right at the opening time- 10 AM, found very little crowd, almost no queues.(b) Choose day other than Friday, Saturday or public holidays- to avoid crowd.(b) Carry small plastic/ waterproof bag for towels and double water proof pack for your camera. This you can carry as you enjoy the rides. Keep rest in AED 25 or 35 lockers in the changing rooms. Towels are available for purchase or hire but are very expensive.(c) Rubber slips-on or flip flops.(d) Get your water park wrist bands charged for min. AED 200 to take care of snacks/ lunch for 2 adults + 2 children after rides. Any balance is refundable at the gate. AS SUCH ITS VERY EXPENSIVE!!(e) YES you can carry your own water/ energy drink. But NO food items!(f) About 3 hours are sufficient, although children were insisting for a longer stay, may consider as per your itinerary. We were out at the lunch time."

At 40 years old this definately brought out the kid in me. The Jameira Sceirah ride should not be missed, being dropped through a trap door into a vertical drop had the adrenaline flowing.I also had a go at the \"Fisho\" stand. 50Dhr to have small fish nibble at your feet. Once you get over the tickling, it is very relaxing. Dont know how much good it did for my feet, but enjoyed it none the less.For a day out highly reccommended."

You can also get discounted tickets at the supermarket but beware the date on the ticket is for when you want to go. You can also get discounts in the Entertiner magazine.

Much cheaper than the aquaventure at Atlantis, and more compact so less walking between slides and if you're on the doughnuts water jets will blast you to the next slide. The slides are more \"thrilling\" than those at Atlantis (and there are more of them) so not all suitable for young children, although they do have a childrens area with plenty for kids to do.Other reviews have complained of long queues, however on the day I went in early December, I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a slide, even the big ones at any point in the day.Staff are all very friendly and entertaining and I wasn't made to feel uncomfortable at any point by the locals when walking around in a bikini.It's even safe enough to leave your valuables on a sun lounger all day unattended, although there are lockers available. You also have an electronic wristband that you can charge with money for lunch and drinks etc, which is very handy so you don't have to carry cash. The wristband are also used to collect digital photos from the photographers around the park and on the slides. My only negative point about my experience and that is when we went to view our digital photos at the end of the day using our wristbands, only about 3 of the 8 or 9 pictures had been saved and some photos of strangers had made their may into our file, which was shame as I think there would have been some good ones in there. It's a shame also because the exact same thing happened at Aquaventure."

The park has a good selection of different rides, despite being squeezed into a relatively small area. We also visited Aquaventure whilst in Dubai and were rather disappointed as we felt that although it's a large park the rides are all similar, preferring Wild Wadi. The wave pool was nice for little children but the waves were more like ripples than proper waves! It was quiet whilst we were there so the longest we queued for a ride was 10 mins and that only happened once, however it looked like the queues could be long at peak times.

The ride on the big float around the park is great fun as is the frighteningly high main slide that feels like you're about to fly off on the way down! Definitely worth a visit but i'd recommend wearing swimming shoes/rubber socks as in the summer your feet will scorch on the pavements between rides. visited mid 2006"

I came here for the day with my boyfriend (we are both in early 20s) and whilst waiting to get our tickets a very kind couple in front gave us a buy one get one free coupon so this saved us LOTS of money, was quite thrilled! The park has a really good money system which lets you put cash on a wristband so you don't need to carry wallets with you (something that many other water parks in the world should really get in my opinion!). The jumeirah scairah is a MUST DO for any adrenaline seekers!! Love this ride!!! The park was generally nice and clean, typical fast good available all around. There are fantastic places to get a photo with \"professional\" photographers both underwater and around the park, although the prices were a bit steep for my liking. I preferred the photos I took on my own camera in the end. Lots of places to get your snap of the Burj Al Arab from inside the park too. Chose this park over the Atlantic because of the distance it was from our hotel and the price. Overally I really enjoyed my day here!!! :)"

There are only 3 real slides in whole the park and the rest are not exciting at all. The good thing for lazy people is, there is a mechanism for push you up by water, so you don't need to walk up the stairs. But I'm sure if they replaced these with some exciting slides, it would be much better and amusing."

There are slides, going upwards - amazing.There are two thrilling slides; you have to use rubber-rings for 4 people; even if you are only two of you. Thrilling!!! :) Try it! :)You can have fish-spa, which is extremely funny.You can by a plastic glass, which you can refill with Pepsi anytime for a few AED."

It's located beautifully next to the Jumeirah hotel, the beach and the Burj al Arab, so views from higher points are great. So are the slides, and the large pool. Tubes don't need to be carried 'up', the have a very inventive system of pushing you up in upward waterslides, great! Everything very clean and lots of staff to keep you safe in the water.

He said that I was not allowed to leave my clothes there(what are the clothes hooks for then?).He said thet I might accuse the park for lost belongings (anyone wants to steal an old T shirt and used cargoes?). When I said that I assume responsibility for them if they were lost, I was told that it was against the rules. But apparently you can leave shoes behind in the open(so someone can nick your new \u00a3120 Nikes).

You can spend all day looking at the sheer magic of the building and it's architecture.2 x adults and 2 children (5+7) was around \u00a3150 GBP - no food allowed in and lockers and food cost - put on credit watches which you take with you around the park and refunded credit, in cash on exit.

Amazing rides (water slides that go up the hill, so no climbing up the stairs), pools filled with sea water ( no chlorine which is a bonus) and all the kids must wear life jackets when playing in the pool area. There is heaps of life guards, more than I've seen at any other water park. Even parents with small kids are able to take a bit of a break here. Yes, expect the food and entrance to be more than usual, but it's totally worth it.The water park staff is very friendly and when it comes to food expect the usual Fast foods you would have at any other amusement park. There are so many rides and so many things to do, that you can easily spend the whole day there.

But I would recommend Wild Wadi as it is more cost effective and once in the park the costs such as food, locker hire etc are alot more reasonable then some of the others.Wild Wadi is clean and well kept. The staff are very friendly and on hand to help. They have a great children's area for those little ones that aren't tall enough to use the rides. Recently new riders have been opened and they are alot of fun (or so Im told).Queues for the surf machines can be long, but they generally let you have a good turn even when you fall off after the first few seconds !!!One of the best places to get a fantastic photograph of the Burj Al Arab as well if you are interested. Walk to the back of the park which is closest the beach. There is a gift shop and food place which has decking on the roof. Best place for a piccy!!If you want to save some money you need to go to the book shop in the mall and get a family entertainer book as they have buy one get one free tickets. It might seem pricey but if you are planning to do alot in Dubai this will save you ALOT of money."

A few useful notes, they will check your bags for drinks or food as you go in. They want you to buy their food and drinks. The food options are basically fastfood, and a bit pricey. I wouldn't say the food is good value for money at all. Although the weather is hot and sunny most year round, during the summer it is abnormally hot, this means you'll be making sure your head isn't in the direct sun all day. Running from one activity to other as the floor can be real hot.Having said all that, it is definitely a must visit while in Dubai. The highlight is the air doughnut that you sit in and it floats you to and from lots of the activities.p.s. warning for the ladies, the vertical drop is great, but there is a reason lots of young lads are standing at the end of the water slide, biki tops amlost always come off!"

What a disappointment, though. We queued for 30 minutes just to get in, then very long queues for all the rides - not that there is that much choice of rides.However, in case queuing to get on the rides isn't miserable enough, the rides themselves then jam up due to the number of riders, so you end up going around the course in a series of stop-start phases, which totally ruins the flow and any excitement of the ride.In 5 hours on site we only managed to get 5 rides.The solution to this problem is so simple - just limit the number of people entering the park! Unfortunately the operators don't seem to care whether their customers actually get value for money, instead cramming the place with as many unsuspecting punters as they can.We are not a family of whingers and we certainly expect to queue at any theme park, but this was the worst example of profiteering at the cost of quality and value that we've ever experienced.Think VERY carefully before parting with your \u00a340+ per head!"

The location is convenient, although I have to admit a bit awkward as I am not used to having views of a bustling street while I am waltzing around in a water park in my bikini. However, the other side of the park offers beautiful views of the Burj Al Arab and the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, which make it an ideal tanning spot. Spent 7 hours with my friend and her little sister, which just flew by! Staff were friendly and generally had a good attitude. The rides were fun and exciting and it was thankfully not too crowded. Would be best to go in a big group of friends to thoroughly enjoy and as I had been there in 2011, I hope they have added more options for attractions and rides since then. Also, look out for the various offers and promos that they have on offer with regards to the entrance fees!"

We went on a Monday and it was busy but the queues were by no means very long... so it was fun all the way. The views of Burj Al Arab and the Jumeirah Hotel add to the environment... All the lifeguards and staff around the park are extremely helpful. One tip for the photographs - make sure you ask for deals when they push you to buy - 130 AED per picture was very expensive... and you can get a USB with all your pictures for 250 AED (most of us will put them on iPads and the such like anyway)."

            "review": "Best Water Park in Dubai. Closely overlooked by the world\u2019s most luxurious hotel in the world, The Burj Al Arab, you are guaranteed a great day of fun for all the family at the Wild Wadi Water Park in Dubai. Packed with daring and fantastic water slides, waves of fun, kid friendly slides & water play areas and a big lazy river for those who prefer relaxing, you will not be disappointed!\u2022 Entrance at Wild Wadi is AED220, I would put a minimum visit time of at least 5 hours probably go for all day really. It clearly does get busy at times because there is evidence of queuing systems for some rides and so it would presumably be best to avoid weekends (Fri and Sat) when the locals will be using it. \u2022 You get given a wristband on entry and you pay a small fee (AED20 for small) to use a locker access for which is put on the wristband (they will ask you if you want a small, medium or large locker) a small locker only really good enough for 1 person.\u2022 They have a cashless payment system - you load cash on to a wristband which you can use for food, drinks etc, which is good. It's mostly junk food, just so you know. If you don't spend credit you get it refunded in cash when you exit. \u2022 They will take away any food or drink when you go through security but will keep it in a fridge for you to collect on exit.\u2022 There is free water available inside (small drinking fountain) to the right hand side of ladies changing rooms.\u2022 The rides are brilliant something for everyone from lazing around in giant rubber rings on a lazy river to the new Sceirah ride which is a brilliant ride for the adrenalin junkies!\u2022 A tip - unless you're bagging some loungers and leaving your things there, put everything in your locker - flip flops, sunglasses, sunscreen etc, as you can't carry it with you. The walkways get very hot in the sun so you have to walk quickly, or find puddles! I imagine you would need to keep little ones' sandals on to walk as it would be too hot for them in the summertime - they do have racks by the rides where you can store your shoes. Wear lots of sunscreen and make sure you go back to your locker to put more on. Bring towels - you can hire them but you have to pay."

I went today October 11 2012 it opened at 8pm and closed midnight. This is for the local women so they can remove their traditional clothing as men and children over 8 are not permitted, nor is photography. What this means is there are zero queues I waited for nothing and I highly recommend the tantrum alley and the jumeriah sceirah.

The \"wristband credit system\" is an innovative aspect, where you don't need to carry Dirham around to pay for any extras, just load up the band and you can check your credit on the many scanners around the park. The rides are fantastic and certainly had the adrenalin pumping. Change room is clean, with lockers provided as an extra fee, but well worth paying for. Shoes are a must as the concrete paving is scorching when walking around. The gift shop is in need of improvement, as in better stock. Signage is somewhat lacking as to where and how to get to some of the rides. Taxis are plentiful when your day is over.All in all, we had an awesome time."

They've got you over a barrel there, unless someone wants to sit beside the bags all day you need to get one. Or two, or three, as they are tiny. They have the cheek to ask 35 AED ( nearly \u00a36.00, $9.50 ) for a so called large locker which is a stupid L shaped affair ( so that they can fit in more ) and little use to anybody. I have to say that the whole place was pretty tired and tatty looking; especially the changing rooms which were dark and dingy. So dark in fact that we almost left a good pair of sunglasses behind as we couldn't see into the locker properly. At the start of the day when it was quieter, the rides were all properly managed; i.e. the next person was not allowed to go until either the green light came on, or the last person was well out of sight. As it got busier however, these rules seem to fall by the wayside as the queues mounted up. We watched a few instances on parts of the river rides where the staff were very lucky that they didn't have anything more serious than cuts and grazes to deal with. There were quite a few walking wounded being treated along the way. The big rides stuck to procedure though and they are quite spectacular and worth a visit.Food and drink stalls are everywhere; usual run of the mill fast food stuff and expensive. All in all it was quite disappointing, and I doubt very much if we will ever be back. My advice would be to save your money and go to the Atlantis waterpark instead. Far nicer!!"

My husband and I were in Dubai for our twentieth wedding anniversary.We had the most awesome day at Wild Wadi.This is a great place for everyone,even old folks like us.Water, water everywhere.The Master Blaster tube rides were great fun and everyone we saw was laughing or smiling.Staff everywhere were extremely friendly and helpful.It was a joy to be there.The food is suprisingly good, lots of fruits and healthy options.Put your money on a waterproof wristwatch and you don't have to worry about carrying cash.There are some lovely views of the Burj Al Arab, so it's a good place to take your photos at the end of the day.My husband loved the waved rider and the Jumeirah Sceirah.It is such an attractive and well designed place.We didn't wait too long for anything.The ground was never too hot for bare feet, thanks to sprinklers on the paths.You don't even have to walk up stairs if you don't want to as water jets will push you uphill.We also went to Aquaventure but I think Wild Wadi was my favorite.We really had the best fun day in years and can't wait to return with our kids."

This is the 2nd time I had visited and still enjoyed it as much as the first.Look for the entertainer voucher books in places like Carrefour (A5 telephone directory style book!) which is full of 2 for 1 vouchers including several vouvhers for Wild Wadi. Although the book costs AED350 you will likely recoup this and more (PS voucher book also has vouchers for Ski Dubai and loads of other places). Entrance at Wild Wadi is AED220, I would put a minimum visit time of at least 5 hours probably go for all day really. It clearly does get busy at times becasue therie is evience of queuing systems for some rides and so it would presumably be best to avoid weekends (Fri and Sat) when the locals weill be using it. We went on a Wednesday and found it was relatively quiet with only 10 minute queues for the 2 bigger adrenalin rides.You get given a wristband on entry and you pay a small fee (AED20 for small) to use a locker access for which is put on the wristband (they will ask you if you want a small, medium or large locker) a small locker only really good enough for 1 person. You also can charge your wristband with credit to enable you to buy food and drinks without needing cash. If you don't spend it you get it refunded in cash when you exit.They will take away any food or drink when you fo through security but wil keep it in a fridge for you to collect on exit.There is free water available inside (small drinking fountain) to the right hand side of ladies changing rooms.The rides are brilliant something for everyone from lazing around in giant rubber rings on a lazy triver to the new Sceirah ride (check out YouTube before you go so you know what you are letting yourself in for) which is a brilliant ride for the adrenalin junkies!Would definitely goagaineven though it is quite expensive"

There isn't too much for smaller children other than a wave pool and one play area but the kids who were there seemed to enjoy it.The only negative is that it is a little on the expensive side for entry. We had a by one get one free voucher from The Entertainer which I would highly recommed buying if you are going. This saved us a fortune.

How wrong I was - it was all that AND more! Visiting this place actually made me feel like a kid again - it was great! There is SO much to do - so many water slides and so many pools, it would be easy to spend a day here. As it was, we only had a few hours, but made the most out of it.There are lots of positives to Wild Wadi, but in brief: * There are lifeguards everywhere - you never need to worry. * Sun-lounges have little covers over them to help protect you from the scorching sun. * Each slide gives you a brief description, so you know if you're heading down some hard core rapids or something a little more low-key. * There are pools and slides to suit everyone, and a great area just for kids. * The staff were all really friendly and helpful.One of my friends took the 'Leap of Faith' slide and when she stepped out of the pool said that she was \"shaking, laughing, crying, terrified and elated all at once\" - I'd say that's a pretty good review! :)"

The Jumeirah Sceirah ride is not even a mildly thrilling ride, the danger factor makes it something to be afraid of. I was lucky to come out alive with some scratches and grazing to my back. I followed all instructions closely, but it seems that the 900 test-runs just weren't enough. On my previous visit to Wild Wadi, it had a pleasant experience. Even though the temperatures were searingly hot and there were sweltering conditions, the park did take measures to keep customers cool. This was perhaps the only positive of the day."

My family and I visited Wild Wadi water park in Dubai in August .We have experienced plenty of water parks around the World and we enjoyed this one.There were some unusual rides, which my family enjoyed. The park is not huge, but there is plenty to do. It opened at 10.00 and after the initial push and shove, it calmed down and there were lots of places to sit in the shade or sun.As you come into the park there are security people checking bags. No drinks are allowed in or food. We had brought a bottle of water with us. It was taken away and the guard gave us a card which we used at the end of the visit to reclaim the water back. It had been stored in the fridge, so it was rather nice to have a cold drink , while we waited for a taxi outside. We paid for a locker which was located in the changing rooms as you come in. There is a system whereby you and your family wear a band , looks a bit like a watch. You put money onto one band or as many as you want, depending on the ages of your family. This means you don't need money around the park. You buy food, drinks , ice-cream , they zap your wrist band and as long as you have enough funds available it pays for your refreshments. Bands can be topped up. We thought this was a good idea. The park became noticeably busier after lunch. From 10.00 to 12.00 there were very short queues, after that it took longer to access the rides. We were there during Eid which meant that it was a public holiday so lots more locals were there too. The hotel next door also has free access to the park and its own entrance , this also meant people came in later on during the day.We really enjoyed our day at Wild Wadi, it made a lovely break from the hotel pool and beach.A tip, there was a small magazine in our room at the hotel . It is produced monthly. At the back there are discount vouchers and we used them for our Wild Wadi trip.We really enjoyed our Wild Wadi visit"

Small tip- get there early! we arrived at about 10.30am and were able to go on each ride once without having to queue for long. After lunch time, the big water slides had between a 15 and 30 min wait. The tantrum alley was really fun, you have to have a minimum of 2 people, max of 4 to partake and it takes you really high up from side to side. Im quite a scaredy cat but i really enjoyed it. My fianc\u00e9e had a fab time. The new capsule slide is TERRIFYING!!!! you get placed in an upright clear coffin type contraption with a floor, then once they have taken your picture, the floor disappears and you go shooting down almost vertical. I was too scared to go on it, but my fianc\u00e9e said it was fantastic!!!! It's over in 7 seconds.The staff were all really friendly and just want to ensure you have a great time. They do take your photo a lot and give you a million wrist bands so you can view them all at the shop. We did buy a couple but only because we were able to haggle a good price for the 2. the ground can get quite hot here, so wear sandals. They do have a waterfall which comes on at intervals to flood the ground within the park, which is nice and its lovely also to just relax in the wave pool, which was quite fun. The waves aren't very big though. I can imagine that kids would love itThe views are great, you can see the Burj al Arab from the park, so our photos looked really good. Worth a visit, though costly."

They loved itLifeguards are amazing, we actually witnessed one guard dragging a lady from the deep end of the wave pool - excellent.Fridays & saturdays are very busy with gangs of young men shouting & screaming at every ride - so choose another day if you can.The only thing that shocked me was seeing a young woman in a g string bikini I a strict Muslim country. Really think she should have been told to cover up & show a little more respect"

The great thing about the ride is that it comfortably seats four people in a \"dinghy\". Master Blasters is also a \"must do\". It's a journey made up of 11 water slides, some taking you up-hill just like a roller coaster. The family play area is safe & great fun for kids (even big kids over 40). It's a great place to cool off, especially during the HOT month of October!The Fisho, foot pedicure, was also a fun feature. Be warned, if you're ticklish, you'll squeal!!Word of advice: get there early! The first time we visited, we got there at 2pm & couldn't get in because of the crowds. We were advised to arrive at 9:30 the following day and got in easily. It does get quite busy, so it's best to get all the rides you'll probably queue up for, out of the way as soon as possible. Other than that, it's well worth the visit."

On entry to the water park we would go straight to the Surf Rider before the queues formed. We found the park to be quite busy by 11.30 so we would do the main rides first - surf rider, tantrum alley, Burj surj. Then we would leave the park and return to the pools in the hotel. By midday, the queues were just to long for it to be an enjoyable experience. It was particularly busy as it was Eid (a holiday following Ramadan)."

The 'lazy river' type loop was very varied, with tunnels and greenery all along.The food was slightly disappointing, but we were just happy to have the option to eat as it was Ramadan and most other places didn't serve anything.

We enjoyed a lot, especially with the daring rides. The place felt safe as there were lifeguards all over the area. I recommend staying at least 4 hours to fully enjoy the park. We went there on a Friday (during Ramadan) at around 1:30 PM. There were a lot of people, but not too crowded. Waiting time for each ride was about 5-10 minutes. I commend their retail shops, specifically the one near the entrance (forgot the name). They had a wide selection of swimsuits (though it wouldn't hurt to add more!) at reasonable prices. Staff were friendly and helpful so we didn't have a hard time picking out stuff. Restaurants were okay. Quite overpriced though. Too bad you couldn't bring food in. But, totally understandable. Just hoped we could bring in beverages, at least. (For those visiting during Ramadan, food and drinks are sold inside the park - just FYI.) Changing rooms/facilities were nice and clean. They have free plastic bags for your wet clothes. Shampoo/soap was available (and smelled good!). The lighting could use a bit of improvement though (It was a bit dark in the ladies' room). Also, the \"big lockers\" were not THAT big and it was hard to store some stuff because of the locker's shape (kind of L-shaped). So, better not to bring too much stuff. My other comment would be regarding their signage. Although they provide maps at the entrance, it's not like I'd bring it with me all the time. It would help if there were posts/directions to where the rides were. Or maybe they could just increase the number of signage around the park. Just a suggestion. :)But overall, we had a fun experience at the Wild Wadi Water Park and would love to visit again once the new rides open."

And i every time i go i get just as exited as the first time i went. its just so fantastic, and so safe!Life guards everywhere. and the slides are all well put together and full of excitement and mystery. There are so many rides, however its not that big that you get lost, thats a good thing!.. and the food is also nice, its all little snacks and a bit of unhealthy but its lovely, and simple. Wild wadi is for adults, teens and kids! love it, wish i could go there everyday."

My favourite one however, is Tantrum Alley. As you shoot down the slide it tips you up and you genuinely think you are about to fall onto the road. Quite a feat of engineering! I've been here about five times now and intend to go back soon. I love it!"

Admission was included in our hotel price. I recommend watershoes if you go in summer as the pavement is SO HOT! Loved all the slides and wavepool.

Our younger kid was happy to rest next to it while we went out on rides with restrictions for young children.While Master Blaster and the one where you can surf are good, the best ride undoubtedly is Jumeirah Sceirah. Though I always look forward to fastest and tallest rides and roller coasters, still it made my heart pump faster when I stood at the top this ride getting ready to lie down for sliding down. And, was amazed that my son did not think twice before going down this ride. We both enjoyed this ride most.Juha's Dhow is another one which kids will love.Overall a great place to spend a day in Dubai."

If you were going to select one water park in Dubai to visit, make it Aquaventure at Atlantis The Palm, and not Wild Wadi. Although Wild Wadi boasts stunning views of the Burj Al Arab and the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, unfortunately the slides lack luster. Most of the park's tube slides are upwards propulsion ones, meaning they push you up and around the back, instead of you walking up stairs and then riding a slide down on your tube. While these upward propulsion slides are great for lazy people, they just aren't as fun. The two big tube slides at the top of the tower at Wild Wadi are great and new, but they require two-four people to ride them. Families don't seem to like singles being added to their group, so make sure to bring a friend to ride with. The average age at Wild Wadi was definitely trending younger, as they really just don't have many super-exciting rides."

After 10 minutes of showing our group how smart he was, he decided we only deserved tickets for another day.

It was really inconsistent regulation and it made me really upset with their regulation and procedure. There should be consistent for their procedure/regulation. finally i bought one from their shop and i went there and no guard or even the guard supervisor gave me opportunity to join the game without making long queue as he promised to me before. i was really really upset, and i should wait for ten minutes for only one game. I think the management has to train them to be hospitable and know about hospitality service and consistent. and one more thing to think: never give promise if you can't guarantee to your customer/guest, before the customer/guest get mad that you can't do it at all."

Wave pool nice to relax in, not so crowded when we went but can imagine not much fun if too crowded as Wild Wadi more compact than Aqua Adventure."

Just returned from wild wadi today excellent family day out!We have visited this water park once before and complimentary entrance with free towel hire for jumeirah guests- absolute bargain! We are staying at jumeirah zabeel saray and you need to collect you entrance tickets at the hotel prior to visiting. The tantrum alley was the best ride for us, not for the faint hearted, the inflated family rings powere you high up the walls of the slide as it plummets down hill, the lazy river is always a hit and no need to walk for miles to go on the rides, off shoots from the lazy rivers powers you uphill on rubber rings - great fun. The are ample rings both single, double and junior rings for use in lazy river, all in good condition. The wave pool and kids zone is fantastic and funnily enough lost my hubby in the kids zone for some time! Food is as you would expect fast food things like, hot dogs, chicken burgers, tika, fies plus drink for around 41 AED. But a wild wadi water bottle 30AED for small or 35AED for large including free sunglasses cord and all refills are 5AED wrth it. We added money to a wrist band on arrival whic is a great idea as you do not need to carry any money, staff just scan your wrist band and money deducted. At the end of you visit the balance is returned in cash. Might pay another visit before we return to the uk - jumeirah pulls it off again thank you!"

            "review": "Very disappointing. I was very much looking forward to this water park but ended up being very disappointed. The smell whilst lining up for some of e rides is truly revolting. I started off by going on the big extreme thrill tube ride but waiting in line was a disaster because the ride was stopped for at least forty minutes for reasons unknown. This ads up to a long time waiting in the que when it is a Hal an hour waiting time anyway. The next ride I went on was the tube that goes all around the park. Unfortunately whilst I was standing in line this ride had maintenance problems TWICE because of what I can only assume we're too many majorly overweight people attempting to go up the first tube. Surely the life guards can realise when a person is CLEARLY not suitable for a ride. I went to the park on a Friday and despite the closing time being 6pm, the rides get shut off at five thirty. This is not good when you arrive at 3:30 and only end up being able to go on two rides. Two proper rides does not to justice to the extremely expensive fee paid to get in. The admission prices are far too high, to put it simply. Even discounted tickets towards the end are not worth it because you have no guarantee on doing even two of the rides. Because of some of the massive que's after my first two rides I decided to have a go at some of the children's slides where there were next to no lines. I was not allowed on. I am sixteen so that is understandable. However not when there is practically no line at all and two of the major rides have major lines and the rides themselves go in and out of maintenance. The best part of my time at the park was sitting down near the big pool at 6pm with the Reston my family as the lifeguards attempted to get everyone out of the pool. No one is ready to leave at that early time and it was a bit of a laugh seeing everyone joke around for about an hour refusing to get out. I can see how on maybe another day I would enjoy myself more but upon my first visit I found the experience extremely disappointing (maybe due to extremely expensive prices) and wouldn't recommend the park to anyone unless they got there as soon as the place opens."

There was plenty for each of the girls to do, compared with other theme parks that can offer very little for a 15 month old! There were plenty of life jackets everywhere that the little one could wear. You could use your own floatation devices too - not like the stupid Oasis Beach Tower where we are staying (see my other review).We rented one of the cabanas which was completely worth it as our baby had a sleep in the middle of the day in peace and shade whilst the older two continued having fun (normally we would have to leave by 2pm to take the little one home for a nap, much to the other kid's displeasure!)The service in the cabana is amazing - someone greeted us at the front gate to organise all the tickets, credit on our wristbands etc! We had someone personally usher us to our cabana and take care of our stroller as my husband purchased some shorts. Upon arrival at our cabana at a very peaceful but convenient location, we were given ice cold towels and an esky full of ice cold bottled water - heaven in 40 degree heat. We had a host take care of us all day who, bringing us food and drinks at our request. He even brought complimentary ice lollys each of the many times the girls asked. Even at the time of settling the bill, there is no waiting in queues as the host takes care of that too.There is nothing better than to lie on your own sunbed with ice cold water waiting each time you need a break from all the water fun. Then when ready for your next visit, you have fast pass entry back onto White Water Wadi which means no waiting at all.On this our 2nd visit (our 1st was 10 years ago before kids), Wild Wadi lived up to our previous fantastic fun visit. The weather, the vibe, the eager to please staff (from management, lifeguards, etc), the rides, the music were all fun, fun, fun. My only gripe was the hot walkways, but I'll remember to bring a pair of crocs or similar next time that I can wear on the rides!!I look forward to a 3rd visit someday."

What ISN'T there to do here?My favorite part of the visit was to the water slides. They had multiple slides and they all took you zooming through the park, uphill and downhill, through tubes and tunnels, open air and past views of the rest of the park. It was insane!I'm a big guy, but these things shot me around like it was no big deal.Another thing I love is a good lazy river ride. I love to just kick back and relax while being pushed around with the other sheep. Forget all that - Wild Wadi has a Tsunami \"Lazy River\" that regularly pummels the river with a flood of fresh H2O! Your gentle teetering float gets a hefty push and you cruise the last half of the ride... and do you get off? Heck no! You stay on, because although you didn't expect it the first time, now you plan your Laziness to be int he right spots at the right times and take full advantage of the Tsunami madness!The food at the park was nothing to write home about. Literally. But after hours of lounging and rocketing through the park, eventually you need to refuel your water throttling carriage... and it does that just fine. Of course you are very close to a lot of great dining around the area, so once you leave the park, you are not far from some good eats.Is that all there is to the park? Heaven sakes no. But I spent all my time on the stuff that amused me. If you want to stand in line a bit, you can climb the tower (which I did) and send yourself jettisoning down practically from orbit and keeping cool int he water slide as you re-inter the earth's atmosphere. This tower ride (I can't remember the name of it) could be wedgie inducing if you don't cross your legs. It's a fast few seconds to the bottom, and I only rode it once, since the climb and wait took about 20 minutes. But it was still fun. Worth doing at least once.I can't recommend this park enough. The ticket price was acceptable, and you get free tickets if you stay at the neighboring hotels. FUN FUN FUN!!!"

Temperatures were in the upper 120s, so we were trying to cool off somehow, We have been to the malls the previosu three days, so we needed to do something different. We hit Wild Wadi right in the middle of the day and it ws probably the best choice. Lines were short, water was cold, sun was nice and bright... perfect day for water slides. Even though most of the rides are guided towards kids and preteens, the two rides we were able to go on, the two big tobogans, were SO MUCH FUN!!!! line was not that bad, it is to be expected. a 15 minute wait at the most.The bracelet system is always convenient. You get an electronic bracelet with you reload with money and it works as an atm card, with everytime you want to buy something, they wave the watch on the register and it makes the charge, eliminating the need to carry a wallet or cashwhile getting wet. At the end, whatever money you don't spend, you will get it back, no fees or hidden charges. Facilities were clean, locker rooms were well kept... overall a good plaec to spend a hot and sunny morning-afternoon."

(cheaters discouraged!) there are discounts voucher in big hotels, so you make get in for little less. do not go on public holidays or weekend in the summer, however, or you will spend your day in a queue..splash!"

There is a pool with wave machine (waves about every 20 minutes for 10 minutes or so) with pumping music (a bit like being on a dance floor in the water) and there are some huge rapid-style water slides, running into a river that flows around the park and enables you to get off at various points. There are also lots of sunbeds bordering the pool. For kids, the water shoots are expertly manned with attendants at the top and bottom of all the slides and dotted around the area. It is really so safe that you could leave them, depending on age, if you needed to for a few minutes. It can get very busy and manic, but is a fun day out, or if you are staying at Jumeirah Beach hotel, nice couple of hours every day to cool off and have a laugh. There are shops there selling everything from hats to rash vests, etc and a cafe. There are also life jackets provided for none swimmers."

Really fun rides, and we went early in the day (it opens at 10am) and there was very little queuing. It's very lazy river based, so relaxing. There are also lots of sun beds but i'm not sure i would want to leave my bags out. They have a cashless payment system - you load cash on to a wristband which you can use for food, drinks etc, which is good. It's mostly junk food, just so you know. A tip - unless you're bagging some loungers and leaving your things there, put everything in your locker - flip flops, sunglasses, suncream etc, as you can't carry it with you. The walkways get very hot in the sun so you have to walk quickly, or find puddles! I imagine you would need to keep little ones' sandals on to walk as it would be too hot for them in the summertime - they do have racks by the rides where you can store your shoes. Would also recommend (for women) a sturdy swimsuit - this is not the place for a strapless bikini, as you're likely to have a wardrobe malfunction. Also recommend wearing a t-shirt over your swimsuit as the sun is very strong and you catch the sun more easily as you're in the water all day (I got worse - strap marks for the rest of my holiday!). Wear lots of suncream and make sure you go back to your locker to put more on. Bring towels - you can hire them but you have to pay. I have to say it is expensive, by the time we'd paid for entrance fees, locker fees and a few drinks we spent nearly \u00a3100. But - definitely good fun!"

The park itself although not huge and the new ride not yet open was clean and well organised. The staff are helpful and courteous and there are lifeguards everywhere. Good fun for young and old, no more expensive than a day out to a uk theme park. Having initially dreading it after serious nagging from my 13 year old son I loved it as much as he did! Great day out."

Making your way around all of them in this method saves your feet, and is also quite relaxing as parts of it are just a gentle flow.Wallets aren't needed as you can charge up a wristband on entry that will then give you access to your locker and enable you to buy food and sourvenirs, and any money left on it when you leave is refunded in full.Great way to spend a day or even just an afternoon."

LOVE the fact you aren't climbing stairs all the while - the slides shoot you up before they shoot you down. The 'big' ride is closed and the other big two had horrible wet drippy stairs and the queue was much longer than indicated (clearly not 15 EARTH minutes from this point) - I don't understand why they weren't sending people down quicker, since it only lasted 20 seconds anyway. But I could spend all day flooming round the other shoots and lazy river. Ace :)"

The rides are a lot of fun except for the Jumeirah Scairah (that ride hurts your back a lot!), but I believe they've closed that ride down now. We are residents of the UAE and we were expecting to avail the special AED150 entrance fee, however, we didn't know that the special fee is not during holidays, and the day we went it was the Islamic New Year, so we had to pay the normal ticket price which was annoying because we were 5 people, so we basically paid AED250 extra but other than that, I didn't have any problems. The rides are a lot of fun, even though most of the slides haven't changed since the last time I visited in June 2006. The two new rides that opened last year are also a lot of fun. I noticed that one of the main rides/ slide didn't have a proper entrance. When we first arrived, we were trying our best to find where the ride's entrance was on the map because its always been my favorite, but we couldn't find it. So, then we asked the people that worked there, but they didn't really help. After a little while, we realized that there was no proper entrance to that slide (which was the most fun IMO). We then saw some people walking across the river, and we decided to see where they were going, and to our luck, we finally found the entrance of the ride! The park hasn't properly given directions to the ride BUT the good about this, was that there was no line up's even on a Friday for the ride, since hardly anyone knew where it was so we went 4 or 5 times on it, without having to wait. Food has always been a little expensive at the park, like almost every amusement park, so we didn't eat there this time. Most of the staff were friendly, but some of them were a little rude, so that put me off a little. Also, our locker key had a little bit of a problem in it; We didn't load any money on it, but, when we were leaving the park, it said we had a AED100 balance, and so we were confused. When we told the staff at the exit that we didn't add AED100, he checked the computer again, and said it must have been an error; they should be grateful that we were honest, since anyone else would have just taken the money. Overall, it was a great day out and still my favourite water park in Dubai. Even better than Atlantis. Atlantis is good, but I find Wild Wadi more fun and thrilling, and the most annoying thing about Atlantis is that, you have to climb up the stairs on this pyramid shaped thing every time you want to go on a ride which gets tiring. And, also, I don't think this water park is more suited for children, cause my teenage children loved it and they love thrilling rides. However, if I had to choose my favorite water park in the UAE, I'd recommend Dreamland Aquapark in Um Al Quwain. Although its in the middle of nowhere, its the cheapest park in the UAE, and it has the most rides."

First time at this park - typical sort of entrance fee - thankfully we had Dubai coupons to get discount - one grumble is you cannot even take in your own water or snacks. Otherwise a very clean park with wide range of rides. Not overly busy midweek but could imagine weekends seeing lengthy lines. Super view of Burj from top of family raft. For some rides you need to be really good swimmer but they cater for all safety wise. American influence very apparent with such as wavepool. Plenty of lounges for relaxation & as you would expect in Dubai no real risk of items being stolen unlike the Florida parks"

We went to see the park because we'd never previously visited a water park, our hotel was nearby and we were offered free access; the park is much as one would expect and, although rather small, supplies most of the amenities necessary for a kids day out.The park appears to be clean and safe however many of the staff are rather surly and unhelpful. The queues were comparatively short on the Saturday on which we visited.Just as one would expect there's deafening music playing all the time, extremely exited children running in all directions, junk food, lots of water and a general air of well-supervised hyper-activity. It looked to be perfect for the requirements of the younger visitors, many of whom appeared to be in a condition somewhere between hysteria and ecstasy.We rode all the major rides, could find no food to our liking and so we left to eat in our hotel. The park was OK and I'm sure that children enjoy it but it was a mere shadow of the amusement parks in the US."

It certainly lived up to the hype and was a real blast!We splurged and rented one of the cabana's which I cannot recommend enough!!! The service is fantastic, you can leave your stuff, have wait staff bring you food, and best of all, walk right up to the start of the 'blaster' water slides (highlight signature attraction) without having to queue! It also includes towels, bottled water, and more.The park is pretty compact but packs a ton in. You can choose different paths on the blaster slides each time you ride which makes it very re-rideable. The two new slides can take up to four people at once which makes them great for going with family or friends. The kids play area was busy and could probably use a couple more slides but was easy to watch and fun to enjoy. The lazy river and wave pool were great, and the photographers around the whole park took awesome pictures.The park also has two of the 'Flowrider' surf simulator rides. These are just fantastic. Again, I've done quite a few of these around the world, but the staff working here were so helpful and taught me new tricks and techniques that I had never been told about before.We will definitely visit again next time we're in town!"

This place is now quite a few years old and it starts to show its age because the heat , sun, humidity and dust are not kind to plastic things. Our son liked it but I found that one of the attraction (\"lazy\" river) was too fast in some part and , while sitting on one of this ring, he banged himself quite strong. The main attraction, a big slide almost overhanging the beach road, scared me and I didn't let him do it. We didn't stay very long there and went back to the beach and swimming pools of the hotel wich are beautiful. The restaurant on the beach, \"Beachcomber\" is very nice, beautiful view of the beach, sea and Burj al Arab, nice bbq buffet in the evening. We wouldn't have done a special trip for Wild wadi, it was ok as an extension of Jumeira beach."

It is a small park compared to many in the U.S. The rides are fun, but there aren't that many of them and some are showing their age. There were very long lines the day we went, but we had no trouble getting on every ride, often multiple times. We decided to pick this park over Atlantis since we had been to the Atlantis propert in the Bahamas. We probably should have gone there anyway."

Its very rarely you will see me on the rides at a water park.. usually i leave my son to run around and entertain himself, but this time i joined in to, it was loads of fun, going from ride to ride on the rubber dingy thing. The only thing i did not like was the massive tall water slide ride they had, this thing nearly gave me a heart attack, i felt like i was going to come off of it as i was going down, and i did come off a little whilst in the middle and bang back on which was not comfortable.It is a tad to expensive also.. never have i paid around \u00a350 sterling for 1 person entry to a water park for 1 day before.. i think if the price was made more realistic then i would visit with my son more often as he is always asking to go back there."

Rules are not enforced by the workers. People smoked everywhere. Some of e workers would tell them couldn't smoke but did not enforce the rule and the smokers contnued to walk away laughing.A group of four young people, aged 16-17, cut the line on the Burj Surj ride, pushed their way to the top. Everyone was angry with them and reported them to the staff. The staff made them wait five minutes then let them go on the ride. When I asked the main worker, Hassim, why he would not kick them off the ride or out of the park and he asked, \"What was my problem?\" He seemed to be encouraging kids to cut the lines.Bottom line, if you can only go to one water park in Dubai - go to Atlantis. If you want to go to two water Parks in Dubai and have a good time - go to Atlantis twice."

I was then directed through into the park to where i got my towel and locker for a small fee. All the staff where very helpful and very friendly.I arrived at about 10:30am which was perfect as there was not a large crowd until it picked up at about 11:15am, so i had plenty of time to get a sunbed in a nice cosy position. But don't worry, there are plenty of sunbeds to go around.Wild Wadi has plenty of things to keep you amused. The park has a great selection of Waterslides, Rapids and Wavepools. There also never much of a wait as rides are running at a fast past so you never seam to be waiting in a line.Wild Wadi also has some great views of the Burj al arab and the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, so don't forget your camera.If your after a day in the sun with some fun.

We had a fantastic time at Wild Water Park, we went straight there immediately after checking in, not minding the jet lag and time difference, and the layover in Quatar. We have unlimited entry into the park because we stayed at Jumeirah Beach Hotel which is right next door. Tips you need to go on all the rides!!! We did and when we are tired we relax in the wave pool which was really cooling from the heat. Lovely place my son cannot wait to go back."

During the summer months when it is warm all through the night, Wild Wadi keep the doors open until midnight once a week for a Ladies Night! This means it's not only for female visitors, but that all the staff working there are female too (perhaps not that important for some, but for Muslim women this might mean the difference between really being able to let their hair down or not). It's a fantastic venue for the whole family in the day, but we decided to give it a go at night and go without the kids - and we had an absolute blast! The views from round the park at night are amazing - the only downside in fact was that no cameras are allowed on Ladies Nights, so I wasn't able to get any shots of the neighbouring Burj al Arab. It does get chilly waiting in line for the rides though, despite the high evening temperatures, so don't be afraid to do this right in the middle of summer! I am definitely going back there again once summer is here again - the thrill of the rides in the dark is so much greater than during the day!! It's a real shame there are no couples nights when you could go and relive your youth with your husband/partner and leave the kids at home... but if you can get a girlfriend or two together, this is a night not to be missed!"

Also loved the fact that we could walk along the beach to get entry from the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. Weather was a tad on the chilly side but at least then we didn't have to queue much. Can imagine it being quite exposed in the heat. Having grown up going to the Disney waterparks I have quite high standards so didn't know what to expect. Decor-wise it doesn't compare but I thoroughly enjoyed the rides, especially the interconnecting uphill slides that mean you don't have to carry rubber rings upstairs like with most waterparks. Tantrum Alley was terrifying though, even for someone who loves rollarcoasters so would not recommend unless you are very brave. The lazy river is pleasant and the wave pool was very good: warm water and views of the Burj Al Arab. A great way to spend a day in Dubai."

We had done all the rides within about 2hours! Not complaining though as had a good time, & stayed from about 11-4 in the end. When you go in you pay for a locker & get a electronic wristband which you also load cash onto to spend inside. ( Good idea as means you don't have to keep going to locker) No food or drink is allowed inside, not even bottles of water. Anything you have is confiscated when you go in but stored & given back to you when you leave. I would recommend taking in an empty bottle as there are water fountains around the park if you want to fill up.  Good, clean changing & shower areas. I imagine they would get very busy on a popular day as there isn't that many.There are rides to suit everyone. Lots of comfy sunbeds. We found some overlooking the beach & Burj AlArab.

They check your room number on a computer, and you're in. They provide towels but not lockers free, so leave valuables back at the room. As with many water parks, it's quite hard to get your bearings, so make a base somewhere so kids can meet you back there if you get separated! In feb there were hardly any queues at all, and we got to do all the rides we wanted v quickly. We took a water bottle in our bag but that's frowned on, I think you're supposed to buy all food and drink there. They take pictures of you as you go around, and give you a wristband to check them later. Enjoy!"

So I would recommend those with kids, should stay at jumeirah hotel, which offer direct access and free admission, apart from the room charges, the total cost would save a lot. Speaking of the waterpark itself, it's only about 3 or 4 major slides, which is quite less than I expect, a wave pool, and some kids mini slide. A big plus would be , since no food and beverage allow from outside, the food and drink inside the park charge in a reasonable level. Also the slide itself do joy and excitement indeed. Wish someday a bigger waterpark will be available, since Dubai always love to break the records of greatest size."

As the main ride is being renovated the two remaining \"thrill\" rides were busy, but worth a 15-30 mintue wait - we splashed down with smiles on our faces every time. The flowriders are super with patient staff who took time to give instruction to beginners. I was amazed by the large number of lifeguards on duty, all of whom were smiling all day, and cleanliness of the park.The bracelet money system is great and avoids the worry of cash in the park. The changing rooms were a little busy and claustrophobic. Free parking."

Queues can be smelly - I don't know why, and I don't want to think why - I just know to take Velcro sandals with me! It would be so easy for them to employ people to clean litter - you don't want to be swimming with tissues in the water. Same old rides, exciting if you've not done a wet theme park before. 2 new rides - great for when you are on them, but not worth waiting nearly an hour. Expensive day out and you feel hard done by when you have been on less than half of the rides. Put enough credit on the wrist watch to buy food, drinks, lollies. You can get a refund of unused credit. Take sandals - ground can get hot. UV Wet shirts worth it if you burn easily and even if you dont. Change of clothes can be left in a pay for locker. Free access if you stay in any Jumeirah hotel."

We were staying at Alqaser Hotel and entering the water park was complimentary for the hotel residence. I remember the price was a bit expensive so for a family with a young kid they will save a lot by staying in the hotel. There was a gold car that took us from the hotel to the park which was also part of the enjoyment."

We actually preferred this water park to Aquaventure. The slides are so much fun, with shoots that send you up the slides rather than down!! Wild Wadi BASHER was possibly our favourite slide!! There is also a surf pool which has the amazing Burj Al Arab overlooking it.If you are staying at the Jumeriah beach resort then I am pretty sure that you get free entrance to this water park!!We spent the whole day hear until about 7pm at night!!! It has lots of facilities including towel and locker rental, food facilities and amazing views!!! Back in 2008 it was relevently cheap to enter the park and we found it good value, however when visiting back in Oct 2010 (i know my date of visit wont let me go back that far!) it appeared to be shut for a refurbishment!! Looks like they were building plenty of new slides!!!Definatly would recommend this to all the family as it is a great day out!!! Definatly take plenty of sun cream as it gets extremely hot when walking around!!!"

You only have to climb stairs for 3 rides in the entire park: The Jumeirah Sciera, Burj Surge and Tantrum Alley. You sit in inner-tube like floats, like inner-tubing downriver, but then at intervals along the course, you get blasted upriver or upwards by these water jets up chutes that lead to the different slides and rides.We actually rode this system up most of the way to The Jumeirah Scierah which is a long climb otherwise.Tantrum Alley and the Burj Surge are rides that where you ride in a dinghy with other riders. Definitely give Tantrum Alley a try.Comparing the Leap of Faith at Aquaventure Water Park and the Jumeirah Scierah at Wild Wadi, the Leap of Faith is the more spectacular ride.Worth a visit."

There is a decent amount of food options - not particularly great or cheap but decent when compared to other amusement parks.I went during the \"winter\" so the park wasn't packed and maybe that is why I found the park a bit repetitive - during peak times I would imagine that the queues would be crazy.Overall this was a good experience and it would be really fun if you had kids. I wouldn't go back and do it again - once is enough but I did enjoy it."

I just couldn't pluck up the courage for the Jumeirah Sceirah!There are 3/4 places to eat, all serving the same style of 'fast food' - burgers, chicken nuggets, pizzas, salads and pastas etc. It's very handy to have the wrist strap loaded with money so you needn't worry about your purse.Changing rooms and lockers were adequate, nothing fancy but were being constantly mopped and cleaned whilst we were using them.

Wild Wadi is brilliantly situated between the Burj Al Arab and Jumeriah Beach hotels so there are some fantastic photo opportunities before you even get in. We decided to spend time there on our last day in Dubai after we had checked out from the hotel.You're given a wristband when you get there which gives you access to your locker but you can also load money onto it which you can then use for food and drink in the day.There were about 8 rides so not that many but they are really good fun. you sit in rubber rings for most of the rides. I really liked Tantrum Alley and the Burj Surj and probably went on them about four or five times. The view of the Burj Al Arab is fantastic at the top of those rides. The queues weren't so bad on the day we went and that was also on the weekend.I personally skipped the Jumeirah Sceirah but my boyfriend did it - it looked terrifying! it is apparently the tallest slide outside of North America. It is actually quite entertaining just watching at the bottom of the slide just to see people's reactions when they get to the bottom - can be very funny.There are plenty of sunbeds if you fancy just taking it easy. there's also a wave pool and they provide life jackets for kids.We spent about four hours at the park and that was probably enough - having said that we didn't eat. It's a great place to take kids (we didn't) or if you need to pass the time in the day after checking out and going off to your flight."

The whole place is clean, spacious, pleasant to look at, there are enough comfortable sun loungers for everyone, free drinking water, and the food is pretty good compared to the usual theme park fare.Staff are very friendly and helpful and seem to be having a good time which adds to the atmosphere. I especially enjoyed trying the flowrider surf ride where you get a mini surf lesson from staff every time you ride, even volunteering to try the stand up version, and entering the inflatable hoop race on the wave pool.The rides are very good and safe too. There is plenty to keep everyone amused and many of the rides are very re-rideable. The capacity of the rides, especially the masterblasters is quite high, so the queues are never too long."

Also the sights and people are amazing, though one can mostly find either westerners or the locals. Regardless it is a fun place to be and you can easily cover 3-4 hours going round. Many opportunities are there for taking photographs esp. with Burj Al Arab as a backdrop.In addition there is a fish spa, ice cream corners and other dineries.Please take note of these points to make your trip more enjoyable:1) Buy a Suntan lotion, if you purchase it from inside it is relatively more expensive.2) Do not carry any food or drink; its not allowed inside and they check in the entry gates3)Keep spare set of clothes and towels4)In the entry gate or even inside, you can convert your paperback currency into magnetic credits stored in your arm band; this can be useful as you won't have to carry around your money and risk getting it wet. Keep atleast around AED 100-150, to help you move around. Rest of your wallet or money can be kept in the lockers.5)If you are allergic to the sun, or don't like water in your eyes...make sure you are adequately covered with a swim suit and googles. Only get good quality slippery swim suit as other relatively dry fabrics can impede you during water slides and are usually not safe. In most rides you won't even be allowed in such cases.6)Goes without saying, but do not let go of children. It is still a place with lot of pools and it may not be safe although they have an impressive amount of safety protocols in place and more than enough professional life guards.7)Try to rent a large locker instead of a small one, though it will mainly depend on the amount of things you need to store.8)If you are a heart patient or prone to vertigo...please get a clearance from your doctor. Try to avoid most free fall rides9) Keep your loose things tied with your wrist (I lost a very expensive pair of polarised sunglasses while swimming). If you lose anything make sure you immediately report it to the lost and found.10) Keep 4 hours in hand, to have a total and complete fun"

All the slides (except the really big one) use inflatable tubes to go on (provided). Expected some rides to not use tubes but that's okay. Expected a larger variety of rides. There are really only about 7 different rides just a couple of them are a long series of connecting slides. Overall had a good day. Check your hotel for a coupon as we go 30 dirhams off from our hotel."

I would suggest looking online for discounts as it can be expensive. Food inside the park is passable but not special. Better to go in the November to March time frame as it is a bit cold for the locals! It is a big park though so even a good place to go as the weather gets warmer. Arrive early if you want a nice spot and a lounger. Don't forget your sunscreen and hats for everyone. The number of absolutely roasted tourists I have seen at this place is frightening! Kids will burn like crazy getting in and out of the water."

Unfortunately a bit packed even though it was Wednesday but prior to public holiday weekend. So even vacation and long weekend. Queuing went smoothly anyway and then you can also watch other people which can be fun too. The best is Tantum Alley...real kick and so much fun. We went a few times in row because it was so much fun. the river is nice...a bit of bruises afterwards but great. lifeguards in pools are very nice, friendly and polite. around 5pm the speed/power of the river increased, probably as kids have left. Closing is around 6pm, when the sun goes down. could be open longer as it would be fun at night too...changing rooms are way too cold, not many showers and very crowded especially when closing is near. you can charge money to your bracelet, which makes it easy to leave your valuables locked in the changing rooms. food is average fast food, but the pizza we had was actually quite nice. chairs were occupied but if you know that there are few corners which are less crowded you are fine. few on the burj al arab is cool. i would recommend it, but not for first dubai visitors. and would always prefer wild wadi to the aquaventure, as i am not sure if the aquaventure is really good for the animals and fish in the tanks."

The first day we went it was crazy busy, the rides we wanted to go on had a very long wait so we spent most of the time in the wave pool, that was fairly full too but we still had lots of fun. As we were leaving the resort the staff at the exit gates/towel drop asked us if we were residents & seeing as we were, they suggested we arrive the next morning at 9:30 as the park is open to guests of the nearby hotels solely until it opens to the general public at 10:00.We followed their advice & had a relatively deserted water park for almost an hour, we got to do loads of rides with no queues. The staff even cared for my younger daughter while we went on a twin doughnut ride. Great fun, great staff, loads of laughs! Guaranteed!"

Before going I called them up to see if I could use the Entertainer. A lovely lady by the name of Margery assured me that even though it was a public holiday we could use the voucher. Since it was our first time we never knew what to expect. We arrived around 11.50am and saw people everywhere! But rather quickly a South African gentleman showed us where to queue. The queue was LONG! However it moved relatively quickly. The cashier was very kind and helpful and welcomed us to Wild Wadi with a smile. After we got inside my locker wouldn't work and again right by our side was someone to help. I got my locker sorted and almost in a flash my old locker had a sticker on it saying \"out of order\". Let me start with the negatives. The locker rooms are freezing! Maybe turn the AC off during the winter? The park is very confusing when you arrive, but once you get used to it you're on your way. And lastly there was a man by the name of Prashad by the exit of the Tantrum and the Burj Surge around 13.40pm who was very rude with us. Even though we had these small problems, which I am sure do not happen often our experience was amazing! A very special thank you to Esther who was at the kitchen( the one as you walk in by the souq) during lunch and helped me out with some vinegar. And to all the team working on the section of blaster rides that afternoon. YOU ARE AMAZING! And because of you we will definitely be coming back for more!! P.s We have video's of you which are coming soon! Thank you!!!!! :)"

We decided to visit Wild Wadi as opposed to Aquaventure at Atlantis, and I think we made the right decision.Wild Wadi is visually VERY impressive with prehistoric-style landscape and flanked by the Jumeriah Beach Hotel and The Burj. The resort is scrupulously clean and all ALL staff were friendly, attentive and professional - such a welcome change from the \"grunts\" that staff in many UK attractions communicate with! There were plenty of options for food with a few more healthy options as well, although a few more fresh food/fruit options would have been great. Food wasn't badly priced and the melon from Sinbad's was delicious.We went with our 3yr old and did feel that there could be a more for the very little ones (who still have to pay to get in so should be catered for). The river rides were good (as long as you avoided the waterfall) as was the wave pool but the pirate ship was deceiving. At first glance it seems very child friendly...but every few minutes an enormous deluge of water engulfs the entire structure and is really quite terrifying for a little one. It would be nice to see a small area dedicated to younger children who love the water but have not yet got the confidence to be dunked/drenched/soaked!We felt it was a bit pricey (partic when you add on the cost of hiring towels and lockers) although maybe it would be better value for adults/older children able to enjoy the more intense rides. Overall, don't be put off - it was a great experience and I'm sure we will go again when we are next in Dubai."

I also find Wild Wadi offers slightly more as it has a wave pool and an area for body boarding.One more thing Wild Wadi has is an area where fish nibble on your toes - a strangely lovely experience.The new rides are a great addition to an already superior water park!Well done and we will be back!"

By 1pm queues were about 15 minutes and there were holdups due the stuck people.The central setup of a bunch of slides connected by uphill water jets and rivers is good. Some jets are great - pull your feet up to the tube to spin around. Many slides were ho-hum though. At the end of the sequence, you're dumped in the lazy river and it can take 5 minutes just to get to the first opportunity to get out (even if you go all the way around the river, you have to get out to rejoin the queue anyway). The big multiperson rides are tamer than similar ones elsewhere but last longer. The big jumeirah sceirah is also tamer than big slides elsewhere. Wave pool also tame. There are a couple of free flowriders though but queues can be long.There were plenty of footpath misters and shade so I got around without thongs or a shirt no problem (note that you can wear a shirt on all but the biggest ride). Extras were expensive but I hardly got anything. Note that there are always discount around that you should look for - I got one with my ticket to the aquarium in Dubai Mall.I can compare it to others in the UAE or in America but compared to Australian waterparks, it's slightly inferior - better in some ways but seriously deficient in thrill rides - despite costing the same. Worth doing in the heat of a Dubai weekday though."

The rides are ok but a bit over rated the main problem with wild wadi is it's demographics- 90% men at least which means as a women you are constantly stared at by the local men. We deliberAtely did not go on Friday as apparently it's even worse with the men although I find that hard to imagine after my experience today. I decided to go in the lazy river while my husband lay in the sun- big mistake! I was targeted by a group of about 8 local men on a stretch where there are no life guards who thought it appropriate to surround me and touch me I jumped off the ring and tried to get out the river but they were all groping me and laughing. I shouted at them to stop but they didn't and lucky for me an American visitor came to my rescue and safely escorted me out of the river. When I got back to my husband I burst into tears I was so upset that this had happened. I get that they may stare at you even though I still don't think that appropriate but groping you is stepping way over the line. if you are male go I am sure you will have fun but if you are a decent female- forget it. Such a shame as JBH is lovely and I have enjoyed a few dinners there but not sure I will even go back to the hotel after this. I have been to Atlantis several times and never had any problems. Overall Atlantis is better suited to a mixed crowd"

We had already tried Aquaventure at Atlantis Dubai a few months back, so on our next getaway to Dubai we thought we'd try out Wild Wadi. Overall it was a fun experience and we stayed 7 hours. But compared to Aquaventure it doesnt measure up. Hands-down Aquaventure is more family-friendly for people with young children than Wild Wadi is. If you have small children that are shorter than 1.1 metres, I would highly recommend you go to Aquaventure than WW because it has more rides that are family-friendly. At Wild Wadi the only spots/rides we could use was Juha\u2019s Dhow and Lagoon, Juha's Journey (like a lazy ride, not very exciting) and the Flood River (which was kinda boring coz it wasnt very long indeed). At Aquaventure you have a kids water play area and lagoon area like in WW, but there are numerous other floating rides you can take including some similiar to white water rafting (mild) that the children could go on. I would recommend that if you have children taller than 1.1 metres, teens etc, Wild Wadi is the place to go because compared to Aquaventure it definitely has more rides and stuff. But if your kids are still very little, I would recommend Aquaventure because there are more things to do for the family.On a side note - Aquaventure also has more seats and chairs available than WW. Things are also more spaced out in WW, so you gotta walk a lot. The water is 'cleaner' at Aquaventure with blue tiles throughout (including the floating rides) so it looks nicer. The tiles in the floating rides at WW were black so it makes the water looking dirty and murky.Tips: DONT go during a public holiday (like we did) coz the place is PACKED!!!! It almost ruined the experience because you have hoardes of stupid people doing stupid things, like running around the sides when your little ones are sitting their innocently splashing about. My son almost got ran into by a stupid hoon chasing his friend who didnt see my sun sitting there :(Overall a great experience but because my kids are still little, I wouldnt go again until they were much older. Aquaventure is more suited to our tastes and needs :)"

You are given a plastic watch to wear which you can put money onto which saves you carrying money around and this gets swiped at the eateries if you wanted drinks or a meal. I would recommend if you have a rip vest that you wear it for the jumeirah scairah as the speed you go down will protect you.

There are a selection of \"adventure slides\" and a quite small area for younger chidren to play in. The food outlets are average and expensive. Wild Wadi DO NOT allow guests to take in their own food or drinks including water. It will be taken from you on entry if seen. Additional charges for lockers and towels are levied. TAKE YOUR OWN TOWELS. The wave maker is quite good though again not up to US standards. Because it is the major park in Dubai it is heavily used and long lines can develop for several of the slides. Avoid Friday & Saturday(UAE Weekend) . If you have your own car the hours drive to ICELAND in Ras Al Kahmai is worth it. Keep an eye on the on line discount coupon websites IE Cabone.ae for 50% off offers. Makes ICELAND an even better bet."

We are avid fans of thrill seeking rides and this experience did not disappoint. The Master Blaster ring ride was a great surprise as you twist and turn and then promptly plunge into a huge pool that carries you off to the next Master Blaster adventure! Although, I was too scared to try the Jumeriah Scierah, my mom was keen - her only complaint was that it was too short of a ride ;) After catching her breath, we hit the Tantrum Alley ride...our absolute favorite ride at the park. What a blast! My mom and I haven't laughed and screamed so loudly in years...it was great night keeping cool and enjoying the beautiful park and view of Jumeriah Beach Hotel and the Burj."

The jets are easily the best ride and the only other relatively good ride is the jumeirah scarah which is terrible compared to the leap of faith at the atlantas' aquaventure but the good things are there are some stunning views of the burj al Arab hotel looking over the waterpark because it is insanely close to the waterpark and finally if you stay in the burj al Arab, jumeirah beach hotel or in the madinat jumeirah I think you get free access which is great."

HOWEVER this was my first time with my four year old daughter and it was one of the most nerve-wrecking, heart wrenching experiences I ever had. I took my daughter to play on the child slides which vary in height. To my surprise I was not allowed to go down with my daughter in front of me, but rather had to let her go down first and then follow her or vice versa. I asked the life guards whether the slides were suitable for her age and each time they all said yes. Against my better judgement I let her try. As we moved on to try another slide (the blue one to be exact), I let my daughter go ahead as her cousin was already at the end of the slide waiting for her. As she slid down she got stuck half the way and she stood up and started to walk in the opposite direction. The lifeguard started to whistle and ask me to tell her to sit and go in the opposite direction. I started shouting at the top of my lungs but the water was so loud that all she could hear where mumbled screams. As she continued to walk in the opposite direction my heart was skipping beats and I was screaming at the top of my lungs but to no avail. Then the thing I dreaded most happend. She burst into tears and started shouting \"Im scared, I'm scared\" and then she started to look over the edge. Yes! my average sized four year old was able to look over the edge of the slide. I started to feel myself going faint. Now you must think that the lifeguard was taking some kind of action. GUESS WHAT?! she didnt do a single thing. She refused to let me go down, understandably saying that the force of the water can push my daughter down. But then again, why didnt the lifeguard at the end of slide climb up? why wasn't there any emergency protocol followed? why wasn't the water stopped? You must be wondering how the dilema eventually ended. Luckly for me and my four year old who continued to walk in the opposite direction, she reached an area of the slide which was close to the ledge on the floor beneath me where some ladies who had witnessed the horror reached over and pulled her. I hate to think what wouldve happened if they didnt act fast or if, god forbid, they dropped her as they were pulling her over.Beside the complete lack of action or apparent emergency protocol, I would like to post a few questions:1. Why am I not allowed to go down the slide with my child?2. Why arent these slides covered by some kind of arched net so they can be safe and such situations can be avoided.It was only by the grace of God that this passed. However, it reflected complete and utter negligence by the lifeguard and ultimately the park and unfortunately compeltely ruined and otherwise enjoyable experience."

My family were here on holiday for a couple of weeks and although perhaps not a fair comparsion, as we went to Atlantis Aquaventure on a week day, the two experiences were completely different, Wild Wadi did not quite live up to its advertising as several slides were out of action for at least part of the day. The crowds were unbelieveable and to top it all my partner had his Birkenstock sandals stolen, We reported it to security and within five minutes also witnessed another two people who had also had their flipflops and or sandals taken. If it had been a genuine mistake and they had been taken in error I would have expected a pair to have been found at the end of the day but sadly this was not the case and despite phone calls to security for a couple of days they never turned up. Moral of this little tale, dont wear shoes that you cannot afford to lose so wear the cheapest possible pair. We did have a locker but needed to wear something on our feet to walk between slides as the floor gets so hot even with the little sprays here and there. I would love to know how many pairs of shoes go missing on a daily basis particularly on busy weekend days. Perhaps a bag check on the way out would be worthwhile, I knew of three pairs of missing mens sandals in five minutes, maybe somewhere there is a roaring trade in secondhand foot wear. Final disappointment we were not allowed to take in our cool box containing bottles of water and were then charged 9AED for a small bottle which we were told we could refill with very warm water from the couple of fountains near the shop. Yuk, I had just spent days telling my grandchildren they needed to drink lots of water because of the heat, so come on Wild Wadi management, allow water in, they do at Atlantis. Final whinge, I couldnt find 30 slides, had they gone missing along with the sandals!!!"

I suggest to visit the wildwadi park during weekdays, not on weekends and holidays if you are going with your family. Also note that the food prices are high.. a chicken burger, fries & large cola will cost US$ 11. I think the best place to go is dreamland aqua park ."

It is still a hefty outlay for what is no more than a half day attraction.The core ride of interconnecting slides is still the same and there seemed to have been plenty of hold ups at the time of my visit and there was a breakdown as well for a few minutes.The new replacement rides were fun but so were the previous rides. The park was busy, initially we had trouble getting a spare lounger as many people were hoarding them. As the afternoon wore on their were less queues but waiting times were not that long.The kids enjoyed it. Our youngest liked the kids section of the park. Having been to both this and the Atlantis waterpark, there is little to choose between them. Fun but expensive."

The park offers multiple water rides that will meet everyone\u2019s needs. There are rides suitable for all ages and for families and also features a large wave pool. Especially fun was \u201cFlood River\u201d, \u201cMaster Blaster\u201d, and \u201cRing Rides\u201d - a combination of thrilling \u201crides\u201d and splashes. Jumeirah Sceirah was really exhilarating. It\u2019s best described as a VERY long, sliding board on which you travel super-fast. (The website claims that you travel upwards of 80km per hour.) The wait was kind of long, about an hour; however it was worth it for the opportunity to slide down it once. On most rides you have the option of riding on a single tube or with a partner on a double tube. A few of the rides offer quad tubes as well.For those that are not confident swimmers, life jackets are available all over the park. Additionally, there appear to be lifeguards and attendants around every corner. The park is very well staffed.While at Wild Wadi, I also tried FISHO. The fish spa uses garra ruffa fish (aka \u201cDoctor Fish\u201d) to gently nibble away dead skin from your feet and lower legs. The fish were quite ticklish at the beginning and the sensation was a bit odd. It\u2019s very odd to look down and see multiple fish feasting away at your feet. After my 30 minute session, my feet were definitely smoother. (The treatment was 50AED.)If you plan on spending the day at Wild Wadi, I would suggest that you arrive close to the opening time and choose loungers in a great location. I arrived mid-afternoon and it was difficult to find two loungers together.Lockers are available free of charge. You may also rent towels from customer service. All guests are issued a wrist band upon entrance. When you enter the park, you \u201cload\u201d money onto your wrist band and then you use this to pay for your incidentals throughout the day (i.e. refreshments, souvenirs, etc.) What a great way to avoid soggy money!Overall, Wild Wadi offers great fun for tourists and residents.Additional interesting information: If you stay at the local Jumeirah properties, you will have free access to Wild Wadi. Saturday mornings offer a few hours of \u201cfamily only\u201d time at the park. Thursday evenings are ladies only."

My husband and I are in our forties and went with two teens (12 yo girl and 14 yo boy).We didn't get to the park until about 1pm due to other commitments and expected that we'd be bored within a couple of hours.Thanks to the glorious weather and the interesting set up, particularly the slides which you ride uphill, we were still there at closing time at 7pm.If there was one part that was a bit disappointing it was the food. We saw a BBQ operating when we got there at 1pm, and decided to go back and BBQ chicken kebab and burgers for lunch when hungry. Unfortunately when we were ready to eat it was nearly 3.30pm and the BBQ shop was closed and we ended up stuck with pizza and chicken nuggets instead. The food was ok, but not what we had intended to eat.We weren't allowed to bring any of our own food in, even water bottles. There were a couple of bubblers around to have a drink of water if needed.The really cool thing I liked was the wristbands used for entry. These could be loaded up with a cash value to purchase items in the park like towel and locker hire, food and drinks. This meant we didn't have to carry money around with us all day. The amount put on the wristband which was left over at the end of the day was fully refunded at the shop.All in all a fun experience with good facilities which would satisfy for at least a few hours. Probably most suitable for adults or families with older kids, although there appeared to be areas suitable for water play for younger kids too."

Food seemed to be well over priced compared to what food normally costs in Dubai but when I converted to Australian dollars, it worked out quite cheap.Same deal with the photos they take of you. A tip for the company, DigiPhoto, I know you're in this to make money, it's a business, I get it but please come into the 21st century! I could not get a digital copy of my photo. The only option they offered for this was something like 22 pics and a video on DVD for 600 AED. Dreaming!More options for different sized photos as well. Tourists do not want to always cart around 8x10s with them.The rides were all great and the staff were very friendly.Some warning for the Jumeirah Sceirah: if you are a big fellow, weight or height, you will have some big momentum going on, the last dip will feel like you're airborne. If you're wearing a rashie, tuck it in to protect you're backside. Not much you can do to lose your pants up you're crack though!"

Due to its multiple branches, this is marketed as being 11(?) rides which is a little misleading. But it is good fun and lasts 15 minutes or so. There is also a tall speed slide which is fast but not the best I've been on...prepare for a long queue! There is also a double slide that you go down in big 4 person dinghies...again good fun and there is an \"extreme\" slide that we didn't try. On top of these there is a wave pool, surfing simulators and a lazy river.Overall I would recommend it. The rides are fun and innovative and the place is pretty well run. On the negative side it is expensive (almost 100 GBP for 2 people with locker hire, towels and lunch) and there are only really 3 different rides."

Sure, they will claim that there is more but the tube ride just has a few different options when you go through it. I think you can take all options if you get on it 3 times. We got there at 10am and had done every ride by 10:30am thanks to no queues early on. The place filled up and by 1pm, there was a 30 minute wait to get on any of the rides after this point. We pretty much just paid for an expensive sunbake for the rest of the time.We were going to go to Aquaventure the next day but people actually rate this place similarly in quality to Aquaventure so we decided to give it a miss. I would implore people who rate this park highly to visit pretty much any other water park in any other country to gain perspective."

Not been to many other water parks so difficult to compare but chose WW over the alternative at Atlantis as you can use your Entertainer vouchers here to get 2 for 1 entry. Some of the rides were closed as a new family part is being built and due to open any day now. As other reviewers have said, I would have expected a slight reduction in the entry fee as a result. We both enjoyed the roller coasters and wave pool and found that it wasn't too busy despite some parts being closed. Lunch in the park was reasonable and OK quality providing you're not expecting haut cuisine!Longest queue was for a taxi back to our hotel and stupidly the line goes straight past a big waterfall so we were getting soaked with the spray as we waited. Maybe that is ok in the height of summer when you need something to keep you cool but not in December when the temperature was only about 22 degrees!"

No waits on any rides all morning. It was a warm and breezy day, but the staff at our hotel told us it probably wouldn't be crowded because \"it is too cold today.\" :-)There were two major slide rides closed. Yes, this information is on the website, but there was no discount on the admission price. For big kids and adults, there was one big slide, one tube ride, two stationary waves, and one floating river ride. Not a lot of variety. There was a wave pool and a small kids' play structure too. But those two big slides that were closed would have made a BIG difference in the quality of play all day.The Jumeirah Sceirah was fun, but five days later, I still have big dark bruises on my hips and shoulder blades (I rode five times). Good and fun bruises, but still, plan your visit so you're not flying out right after your Wild Wadi visit, and squirming uncomfortably in your airplane seat.The park cleverly uses a plastic wristband as its payment system. You \"load\" money on the wristband, then when you buy things, you just wave your wrist to pay. It's a nice psychological effect: if you had to hand over cash for your fast food lunch, you might be shocked at the price, but if you just wave your wrist, you don't even notice how much you're spending. It was a pretty expensive day overall, and we didn't even buy any of the many photos that park staff took of us.If we ever return to Dubai, I'll probably take the family again...as long as the other slides are open. So I'll give Wild Wadi a \"recommend,\" but check the website to make sure the slides are working before you act on my recommendation!"

So here are my reasons for not enjoying the park : -Comapred to water parks visited in Malaysia, South Africa this does come close to them at all. Less rides for one. Over Priced as well. Also i understood from the advertising on the webiste that 2 rides were closed. Which severly impacted point 2 even more. For adults all you now have is 1 slide, 1 tube ride and 2 board activities.But what annoyed me more is the fact that Management at the park refuse to use logic and reduce the entry fee as a result of closing down 2 rides. Visting Ferrari world today you see a company that values customer Service. One ride in the THeme Park was not working and the Entry price was reduced by 30 AED. A fair gesture by the Park Mangement. Maybe Wild Wadi Management can comment on why they insist on ripping of customers. I would like to see some sort of gesture of Good faith from Wild Wadi to compensate visitors to the park."

I explained that I wanted to only go to FISHO and not on any rides with my 70 year old mother. That's ok - just pay AED 50/- admission and then the AED 50/- for the treatment I was informed. My mother had read about this and was very much looking forward to it. After a 1/2 hr taxi ride we got to the information counter and were advised that we would have to pay the AED 200/- admission fee to the part plus the AED 50/- EACH for the 20 minute treatment. I explained that this was not what I was told over the phone so the assistant checked with the manager. We were then advised that we would be escorted to the area by a member of staff and would only need to pay the AED 50/-. Happy that this was sorted we waited to be escorted through only to be told that the management of FISHO were not happy with us not paying the admission and we couldn't go through. This was so narrow minded of the management, not to mention a complete waste of my time and ruined what was a lovely day. Come on Wild Wadi/FISHO get real. More people (residents included) would love to only go to FISHO but stop being so greedy and think outside of the box!"

One of the rides was closed when we visited so only felt like we had a small number of rides to go on. Whilst we were there though my husband did get his flip flops stolen. We left them at the beginning of the rides where everyone else leaves them and when we came back they had gone. When we mentioned this to the staff they just said that someone probably took them as the floor was hot and they'd probably turn up later?? So if the floor is hot and you have no flip flops you just take someone else's?? I appreciate that they're not responsible if items go missing but they could have been more helpful instead of saying that it happens all the time. If you visit Wild Wadi make sure you have rubbish flip flops in case they go walk about!!"

The flumes were great, lazy river relaxing and pool areas spotless.Another clever thing was the memory chip you can buy when you ourchase your admissio. It is built into what looks like a dodgy 1980s watch but was so clever! This little device opens and closes your locker (no more cumbersome keys!) but more importantly, you can load cash on it to save leaving money unattended in the park or having to traipse back and forward to said locker every time you want to buy a snack or drink-brilliant!!

The Jumeirah Sceirah was a long wait as was probably the most popular ride. Women especially need to be aware that you can lose your costume on this ride bikini's not advised. While we were there they were doing some improvements to part of the park so not all rides were available but that didn't affect our enjoyment. Food was ok, reasonably priced and in our view a good sized portion. Fresh fruit drinks like the watermelon was delicious a must have! Great idea to have wristbands that you top up with money to pay for food and drink all day, saved us having to carry wet money around. All round great fun with wonderful views of the Gulf, the Burj al arab and the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. Would definitely return."

We bring our own towels and little that requires a locker (we add money on admission to the wrist band). The food is the usual theme park food (nothing special) and the usual cost. We have been in Ramadan and that makes it slightly more difficult to eat and drink by the pool, but the children cope well. Yes, there are the usual Digiphoto shots but there is no great onus to buy them at the end of the day.The park is clean, well organised and well supervised.

The surfing rides are fun if difficult while the tube rides provide enough interest to keep kids amused for hours. The big ride is fast and scary. Once seemed enough. I would get there early as it seemed to become much busier in the afternoon, wait times rise and all the loungers are taken. Main concerns are the cost of entry (~\u00a335/person) and price of food (\u00a35-6 for a buger). If you can get hold of 2 for 1 vouchers (available in a booklet) the day becomes much more cost effective. You also do not have access to beach area. Overall a good waterpark."

There is however, a lack of actual rides to go on. I went on 2 all day. The queues were crazy because I went during the Eid break, which I suppose is my own fault. However the park operators should consider a limit to the number of guests allowed in at any one time - the wave pool is not so much fun when there's about a square-metre each of space to \"swim\" in!! The queues are amazingly long and the locals will chance their luck to get in front of you - do not let them in!!!If you have time, try the water park in Ras-Al- Kaimah instead, it's much better and much cheaper. Wild Wadi rate themselves like the amazing water parks of North America and they simple are notalso, the 'restaurant' is horrendously overpriced and the food (which i had) was below-par"

There are far too few rides but the ones available are good fun on the first go. However given the lack of rides, you will tend to revisit the previous rides only to be met by boredom really.The communal wave pool was nice though and would be especially good for children. In all I would recommend it for a day out in water, but would not recommend it if you're looking for thrills.Point to note: You will most probably walk bare foot through the park as its too much hassle to carry flip flops around...however your feet WILL burn in Summer!! Despite their attempts to cool the floors with sprinklers, there are areas which do not have water and will make the walk to your next ride a painful experience."

This park does not compare to those I mentioned but it is good in its own right. My favorite part about it is where it is located in between the 2 stunning hotels. The rides and attractions are decent. Theres always something to keep you wet. My favorite would be the lazy river and the surfing one. The value for a one time trip is not too bad, but for people who live there it can get expensive. With my entrance fee, locker and food I paid approximately $85. Outrageous in Canadian standards, but then again its Dubai, so why not?"

At that time I heard that the guests of Jumeirah Beach Hotel were free to use the park. I always keep this in my mind and on my next trip to Dubai, I am considering to stay in this hotel and using the facility everyday. The food is good and the prices were okay that time. Good souvenir shop, nice landscape and nice scenery of Jumeriah Beach Hotel and Burj Al Arab. However Dubai has a new aquapark within the Atlantis Hotel, I still think Wild Wadi will remain as a good place for enjoying splashes in a cheaper way with all quality!.The most I liked about Wild Wadi was, yes I admit not much variety of slides but; you do not have to climb up hundreds of steps to reach the start of the slides. It was not tiring to enjoy it. There is a continious slide which takes you all around the park with all excitement. Secondly surfing pools. Thirdly the atmosphere is really matching the concept.Please be reminded that the park becomes so crowded in the afternoon. Go early!"

The rides funnily push you upwards first in most cases. I had done ATlantis the day before which is all downhill. This was different. But a good variety none the less. They had water fountains! (unlike Atlantis) so you can refill your bottle of water rather than buying it at huge markups. Food is expensive, but we have learnt that ALL FOOD is expensive ANYWHERE in Dubai. So....A great outing for the family. Highly reccomended."

For parents safety is of utmost importance, and Wild Wadi looks safe enough. Experienced staff and lifeguards guide tourists every step of the way.Must try the water slides. Kids and adults alike, find the thrill of the ride irresistible. These rides are on tube rings and both up water and down water rides are thrilling. The breakers bay wave pool is also advised for those who want to take it easy, laze the day away in a lounging chair while getting a little wet.Take everything you would take to the beach. Towels, sunbloc, kiddie toys, when coming with children. Food stalls within the water park are rather limited. Eat somewhere else or don't expect a big meal available at the stalls all the time.If you want to learn surfing, Wild Wadi is also the best place to practice. The attendants at flow rider (surf wave simulator) can give you tips."

The electronic wrist band is a brilliant idea, you can choos an amount you want to put on it and use it throughout the day rather than takin money around all day or having to keep going back to the locker, whatever money is left they give back to you when you leave.Depending on what your looking for i would not recommed this attraction, the atlanits palm hotel seems better and says its the best water park there and thats costing around 114 GBP for 2 adults."

The rides are fun until you tired of the very very limited choices; the main launch station was not working proberly and had to be repaired several times which ended up at us looking at this time-consuming event unedr water sprinklers which smelt more like urin than clean & fresh water. Disgusting! Bottom line we lost another good 2 hours being limited to one secondary option and the little kids playground. Forget about taking showers as the water is boiling hot and the staff close by seems to have fun watching people experience this unique 'refreshment\". As for the Staff in general we did find some life guards which did enjoy what theyw ere doing but the majority was obviously fed-up with their daily routine of pushing those tubes around the corners and pushing all sorts of people down the pipes.

She absolutely loved it even though being under 1100mm she could only go on about four of the attractions. One of these, Juha's Dhow actually has five slides, water guns and a deluge bucket. There was no queing for any of these slides. The other ride she enjoyed was the family raft ride called Summit Surge and Rushdown Ravine and we did sometimes have to queue for about ten minutes for this. The first part blasts your raft up a slide and the second part slides you back down a chute. The first part's a bit hard on the bum when you go over the water cannon and the second part is quite boring as I didn't find it extreme enough (plus the raft keeps nipping your skin as it goes up and down the sides of the chute).Most of the sunbed areas were busy and the sunbeds are really shoehorned in. We found the best spot for us was a decking area on the roof of Sinbad's Galley snack bar which wasn't packed with sunbeds and was really quiet. It has the advantage of being close to the toilets and snack bar and connects directly to the family raft ride and the Juha's Dhow attraction. It's also a good photo spot with the Burj al Arab in the background.I didn't find the cost of food to be too bad and it was of reasonable quality.I didn't like the lazy river \"Juha's Journey\". Instead of taking out rings that people had abandoned they were left to float around so there were log jams all over the place where you had to push them aside. There were also a few groups of twenty something local lads mucking about flipping the rings in the air and behaving like ten year olds. I had to grab one of the rings to stop it from clobbering my daughter. Not a relaxing lazy river at all then.It wouldn't be top of my list of places to go but it was my daughters favourite part of our week in Dubai."

But I don't think that very many people who come here first time want go back. The hole place was so crowded, we been here on thursday afternoon which is popular time, but still! We must stay in line about one hour to get any slides. Restaurants was so full of people and around the pools there wasn't enough deckchairs. Yeah, I admit that the waterpark located in spectacular place: Burj al Arab and Jumeirah beach-hotel on the background were unforgettable. The ride called Masterblaster was very nice too, but it was just like the Family ride, I couldn't notice any difference. Jumeirah Sceirah was too scary so we didn't even try it. Flowriders should have been fun - but it's not if you can't surf. Breakers bay was so crowded that we couldn't enjoy about the waves at all. Flood river was ridiculous: the \"creating waves\" were so slow that we almost fall asleep. And Juha's Journey: the hell of the waterpark! Every slides end up with those terrible lazy river! When you have sailed it throught once, you don't want do it again - but you should. So that's why the most of people just climbed up the walls and tried to get away from here as soon as they can. So that's the other problem besides the crowded: every slides are either too easy or too scary. That's why I won't go to the Wild Wadi if I come back to Dubai someday."

We've visited water parks around the world and never encountered this before!The security 'guards' made absolutely no attempt to check through belongings for anything threatening as far as we could see, the only aim appeared to be to take all items of food and drink away from visitors. These were then confiscated until departure time: a whole room inc fridges were devoted to this 'contraband'!I objected to this and was told they are a profit making organisation!! As I said that my children had allergies, I was allowed to keep our sandwiches - I also hid a litre of water and as they weren't doing proper security checks, got away with it! At 36degrees, expensive to buy drinks and food on top of their hefty entrance fees.The park itself was ok but unremarkable and apart from one ride, mild, but staff inside park helpful and friendly. Desert safari definitely worth a go, though touristy as you would expect, we found Funtours way cheaper than Arabian Adventures for what appeared to be same trip and was fun for all the family.Big Bus Tour very good value and a good start to holiday.Beware of the Dubai traffic - a nighmare and don't let a Dubai taxi driver take you to other than a major hotel in Sharjah- they are prone to get lost and charge you for it!!"

However if you are an adrenalin seeker, it's probably not for you.The Park is a good size as it is not too big but has plenty to see and do with lots of variety. The queues move quickly so you are not constantly waiting and spend more time doing.We loved that there weren't many stairs. Kids on waterslides can be quite tiring after a while if you are climbing steps all day so at WIld Wadi you can have family fun but it's relaxing too. At the bottom, you get on a tube and the water and conveyer take you to the top and the water slides. Therefore it is also great for those who are not so mobile.The park is very well presented with great views of the Burj Al Arab and surrounding area from the highest point."

I like the waterpark, cause the line moved along speedily, all rides took an average of less than 5 minutes. And we went on Friday and Saturday, where it is supposedly the most crowded. There is a big complex for toddlers and kids with its own slides. There's the body boarding for more skilled attendants. My favorite ride was the individual tubing slide, where they shoot you up a few times, and once you're up there, you go tubing down the slides, with a total of 11 slides including a completely dark tunnel.It was amazing, fun for all ages, safe and clean."

I found admission to be too high for what it has to offer.

The wild wadi needs more water slides.

We (Couple late twenties) took our 10 year old child to Wild Wadi and were highly disappointed with the whole experience.The rides did not in any way live up to the hype and publicity that promotes the park. In reality there were very few rides (as someone said the interconnected rollercoaster is one big ride) and they were all of yawn inducing quality. On the day of our vist the 'Screamer' (whatever) was inexplicably closed and the 'surfing style' attractions were mobbed by local teenage boys and men which didn't make for a 'family atmosphere' and although my daughter and I would have liked to have tried these rides - we felt too uncomfortable (even with a male) to approach these crowds. Nothing overt but there was defintiely a palpable mood of 'men only need apply' surrounding these areas. Other westerners were obviously also steering clear for this reason. I was also very uncomfortable that my daughter (dressed from neck to knee mind you in a sun suit/wet suit) was actually ogled in a perverse manner by some of the local guests. The showers have no hot water which due to the extreme chill of the air conditioned change rooms is actually desirable (yes even in the dessert in peak summer times). In short, stay away from here - the park is very expensive and doesn't deliver much entertainment value. If you want water park action head instead to Australia's Gold Coast for better fun at WetnWild or Whitewater world (haven't tried the latter but intend to). A visit to wild wadi was supposed to be one of the highlights of our trip but was deemed by each of us to be an all time low. If you are looking for something to do in Dubai consider taking a dessert safari (we had a blast).On a positive note the staff at wild wadi (who seem to be recruited from every corner of the globe) were all outstandingly friendly, helpful and courteous - lovely people. A big thumbs down to those visitors we saw berating the poor staff for the lack of features at the park. As if they are responsible for delivering such a lame product."

Otherwise, you will still enjoy it, but don't expect too much.Adult rides (above 110cm) are:1. Flowriders: 2 surf machines. Take a lot of practice and not worth the effort unless the lines are short and you can keep cycling through quickly to improve technique.2. Master Blaster: tube ride that takes you around most of the park using a series of water jets to go uphill and slides to go down. This is advertised as 13 separate rides, but is best done as one ride from start to finish.3. Jumeirah Sceirah: \"a speed slide that hurtles you at speeds of up to 80 kms per hour! It's the tallest and fastest free-fall speed slide outside North America\". Best ride in park and queues to match.Children's (& big children) rides are:1. Family ride: group tube ride, similar to master blaster but relatively short.2. Juha's Dhow: standard water slides for children.Tips:1. Bring lunch. Food is quite expensive.2. Get there ealry (11am opening time).3. You will be given an electronic wrist band. Don't bother with credit on the wrist band (for food) unless you don't have cash handy.5. If no one can mind your gear, get a locker.6. Grab a sun lounge/s near wave pool asap (You might be the first person in the water park, but somehow most of the lounges will already have towels on them... sound familiar).7. Go straight to Jumeirah Sceirah first before the queues get too long. After that do the master blaster.Once you have done these 2 rides at least once, go on the family ride together. You can then spend the rest of the day wandering around the park at leisure and taking turns to look after the kids etc.Hot Tip: If you buy \"The Entertainer\" book [-] for about 100AED you can use several of the 2-4-1 vouchers, including wild wadi, inside it during your holiday."

They may advertise 20-something rides, but what they don't tell you is that most of them are the interconnected parts of one ride. So, there really isn't a lot of variety.Also, although I hear this is to change, if your children are under 1m10cm, they aren't allowed on many of the rides, being pretty restricted to wet slippery dips coming off a boat. Cute, but not much for over 100 dirhams.Honestly, the propaganda is good, but the park itself is pretty average. I found the staff very pleasant, though, and there is a high safety record thanks to the many life guards. And, surprisingly, the park employs international paramedics in its clinics in case of emergencies, and to look after the Wild Wadi staff. They were very nice to me when I went in to see them after my daughter twisted her ankle. An Australian paramedic was particularly nice, and had us all in stitches with her accent and humour."

We were staying at the Al Qasr on Jumereih beach, so it was literally next door for us. Unfortunately, I think we've been spoiled by the Disney waterparks in Florida - Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon - which the Wild Wadi doesn't match up to. Why? Well, it's quite small for a start, which means you will have to be quick to grab somewhere to sit and put your stuff (although there is an efficient locker system). Although we were in early, we had no chance of grabbing a sun lounger. Secondly, the rides. What makes the Wild Wadi unusual is that on most of the rides, you sit on your inflated doughnut and are then blasted UP hills by jetted torrents of water before coming down the slides themselves. It's quite fun, but can be sore on your backside if you're not careful. You can actually do a full circuit of the nearly all the rides in the park this way without ever (voluntarily) leaving your doughnut, but be prepared to queue for half an hour at the start to do this. Also be prepared for queue jumpers. This isn't Britain, where queuing is a religion, and here people will happily barge there way up the line to stand with someone they vaguely know - unless you stop them. The kids supervising the rides weren't willing to do it.You complete the circuit in about twenty minutes. That leaves two other good thrill rides, the family doughnut and the big tower slide. The former was fun, the latter the queue was too big for so we didn't bother. Plus I have a bad back which was straining after three circuits of being blasted around all the other slides. We had some lunch in the park - again, everywhere was mobbed - and watched the people queing for the surf rides. It looked like fun once you mastered the technique, but how long would that take? After about four hours, we returned to the Al Qasr, and had to fight with taxi drivers to take us the short hop back. It was too long to walk in the hot sun, we hadn't arranged for the shuttle bus to pick us up and we eventually had to ask a security official to demand that one of the taxis take us back. The driver was fuming about it too and it was a pretty unpleasant ride - but at least it was short! In summary, it's worth visiting the Wild Wadi, but don't expect too much from it."
