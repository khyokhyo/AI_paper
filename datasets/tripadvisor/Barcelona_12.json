Practical tip: when you are walking around, keep yourself in reference to the old cathedral. In that way, it is less likely that you will get lost. Many of the avenues have names that can be difficult to ascertain or which change names after you cross an intersection. Any of the locals will be happy to assist you as they generally have good knowledge of the street names."

The cathedral is free in the morning and is certainly worth a visit. Narrow winding streets in the Old Jewish Quarter house many interesting stores. Don't miss the small synagogue, which was just recently excavated."

The Gothic Quarter is full of life (and people) because is near Ramblas, so you must be patient if you don't like very crowdy places. There are a lot of monuments to be seen, including La Catedral (Catedral Basilica de Barcelona), wich is a must see. Also, if you get there, you must see Basilica de Santa Maria del Pi in the Placa del Pi. You can stay in Barri Gotic for hours and not be borred. Everywhere are stores with souvenirs (most of them related to FC Barcelona football team) and cofe shops or little restaurants (but the prices are big). If you go in Gothic Quarter you must go in Placa del Reial and eat at one of the restaurants here (is expensive but is good and the view is extraordinary).The night is not the same thing. The street are empty and looks like from a zombi movie. If you cross the Barri Gotic at night you will see drunk and junky people, not a very nice view. For this I not recomand that you stay at a hotel in Barri Gotic, or if you realy want to stay here, chose one just near Ramblas."

Prime tourist location, can be explored through the Barcelona free walking tour that starts in Placa Catalunya (11am and 2pm), although you will most likely want to come back for the bars, sweet shops and art galleries. Remember that a lot of the smaller places close after lunch and re-open in the late afternoon. The streets are full of charm and history - be in the look out for hidden murals and drawings. Worth walking away from La Rambla and venturing here for food and drinks as the prices will be more affordable, and the quality and service will be better. We found the best turon, churros, ice cream and tapas here during our visit, and most of the places we just stumbled upon. There is also a lot of history to be explored here, with notable buildings, squares and churches - a walking tour would be best to explore these, if not make sure to check out a guide ahead of your visit so you don't miss out.

Around most corners, there are lovely little restaurants with patios, interesting shops and quiet...in parts of Barcelona, quiet can be hard to find but wandering the streets of the Gothic Quarter, you can easily find solace."

Very interesting history tied to Barcelona beginnings. Our guide gave us an informative presentation on the high points of the history of this area. We had planned to continue visiting this area but sadly a monsoon rain started and we had to take refuge in our hotel room to dry off our squelching shoes and clothing. Would love to go back"

I read up on the original village of Barcino, and checked out all the places that still exist from this era and we spent a couple of hours wandering about the Barri Gotic. We saw the remains of the old cemetery, the place where the aqueducts entered the old Barcino, the cathedral, the steps leading to where Columbus asked the Queen for money for his explorations, and many more historical gems. Along the way we enjoyed the efforts of many different street performers. Take your time and go for a stroll, but do your homework first so you know what you are looking at!"

There are hundreds of small, interesting shops on the side streets in the area north of the Catedral, and there is a whole vibrant neighborhood, filled with outdoor cafes, bakeries and even more shops in the area south of Carre Ferran and the fabulous Placa Reial, including at least 3 other placas brimming with outdoor eating options.

The old quarter certainly offers a lot of sights as well as a variety of places to eat from eating a baguette on the run to patio cafes (note: there is an extra charge for eating on the outdoor patio). Ice cream shops abound as do tourist souvenir shops. The cobbled lanes and plazas, packed with people, are, fortunately, pedestrian. Just a fast walk through Gotic's main street was enough for us to feel the atmosphere of this old town as we headed towards the grand bouvelard, Rambla.

We stayed on Via Laietana, the main and busiest thoroughfare through the quarter, that runs to the sea.It's exciting, fun, ideal for a wander, day or night, but it's very busy, especially in the evening. It's the historic centre, so lots of note to see, including the cathedral, the Roman walls, the Viceroy's Palau, the Palau deal Musica Catalana which is a knockout, and the Mercat de la Santa Caterina which we much preferred to the biggest market, la Boqueria, off Las Ramblas, both are tourist traps. We didn't enjoy Las Ramblas at all. There's little of note to enjoy. There are far more lovely places, especially if time is limited.The place is absolutely teeming with life: ice cream parlours, cafes, restaurants, bars abound. Many of the best ones are down the side streets and lanes, so it's worth being a little curious. Lovely art and craft shops, much is Gaudi-inspired but lots of variety is available.We found a great ice cream shop on Carrer de la Princesa that's nene there s hundred years, and a great restaurant on Carrer Comtal, both a little hidden away.We were very lucky to visit during the weekend of the Feria de la Merc\u00e8, the annual city festival in memory of our Lady of Mercy. It's fun. And completely nuts.The place can be teeming, so be prepared for the crowds, chill and go with the flow, and it will be huge fun."

At 5 foot 2 inches I feel like a giant in some of the doorways!"

Didn't get to the church, but well worth the visit."

The local food is good, cheap and amazingly tasty! Playa Barceloneta is nearby and you can go there without using the Metro, just grab a bottle of water and take a walk! Make sure to get some Paella at any restaurant!! Amazing!! Also, know how to get to La Rambla, there the nightlife is always fun and easy-going. Getting to know the Metro system will help you get around easier around Barcelona, just download the metro app and you are good to go!!"

The buildings and streets are a work of art themselves.

Full of atmosphere yet we didn't feel uneasy. The little stores and restaurants are full of friendly people and very inviting. Start from Placa de Catalunya and wander down Avinguda del Portal de L'Angel and just wander off into the side streets. Great place to while away your time. We stopped in Placa Reial and there were a group of young men who were performing acrobatics - incredible performance on the spur of the moment!

It is a lively quarter, with many winding narrow streets crisscrossing crazily (orienting is not easy) and few large avenues (the Ramblas foremost). Lots of highlights to see, with some Gaudi' masterpieces (G\u00fcell's palace) and churches and cathedrals and museums; thousands of bars and restaurants catering to a very lively crowd, theatres, shops and what not! Not far by metro from anything of interest in Barcelona, when you are tired of crowd and want to get some beach time just take a train from the Lyceum metro station in the middle of the Ramblas. Same for visiting other Gaudi's masterpieces, few stops from Lyceum and you are there. But the feel of the place is too nice by itself. There are many hotels too, and at reasonable prices."

I don't know if it's the heat, or bc scent rises, but all of a sudden during a self guided walking tour I would get a whiff of sewer stench or a body B.O. Then I would smell fried calamari (This is true in entire Barcelona ) Smells of the town aside, it's a chuck full of things to see. Must see the Cat4 restaurant where Picasso used to hang out. Gave me goose pumps thinking I'm standing where Picasso stood. I couldn't get into the church bc I had on shorts n tank top. The church was pretty good from outside though. Surprised it was free to get in the church. I couldn't get into Picasso museum also tkts must be bought online in advance if I want to go in. so I went to the souvenir store n got some nice Picasso reprints. It takes about 2 hours to walk through all the areas. I was touring w a slow walker so I finished the tour w nice tapas n ros\u00e9."

There are various beautiful old buildings with ancient spanish architecture. The cathedral is also located in the gothic quarter which is worth a visit. There are many narrow lanes which can only be reached by foot or on the cycle. Placa reil is one of the many squares filled with cafes and restaurants. I did a cycle tour with my son and really enjoyed it. In the nights you can hop from one bar to another because they all are so good and lively. Its a little touristy but then even you are one. Please have a burger at BACAO after you finish with the bars. This place is opened till 2 am and believe me there are queues even at that hour for grabbing a burger. Overall a great district for shopping, entertainment and its gothic feel."

It's a rabbit warren of history, where every corner promises new surprises. Little boutiques cafes, restaurants down little side alleys with centuries of history looming above and around you.

So quiet, peaceful and the lighting is amazing. The bakeries are just opening and the smells of fresh breads and pastries are enough to send your senses into a tailspin. Also, head to Santa Caterina Market to watch then setting up the produce/meat stalls - it's not as crowded as La Boqueria, more mom & pop. The shopping is incredible too.

However one of the main attractions, right in the heart of the district is the huge Cathedral which has a stunning courtyard full of plants and oddly, geese!"

The Quarter hides many bars and cafes, some with amazingly low prices; you'll also find handmade fashion shops and other artisans plying their wares, but you'll need to spent some time looking. My advide: wear comfortable shoes. A really nice part of the city."

The Cathedral is magnificent but take note, they are very strict around Mass times and the dress code is quite strict - no hats/vests for men and no shorts/short skirts/bare shoulders for ladies (they are happy enough with patrons buying a 3Euro scarf to drape over themselves from the vendors outside). Depending on the day you may find a market or traditional dancers/performers or such like in the square.The Municipal Art Exhibition is very good - displaying items from local contemporary artists.Lots of lovely boutique shops and designer chains to be found. There's literally nothing you can't buy here and there is a vast array of bars and restaurants to choose from to suit every taste.The Spanish seem to have upped security in the country generally - which is understandable, since the last time I visited which was 5 years ago - I noticed that there were fewer hawkers of fake/copy goods along the seafront, back streets or close to visitor attractions. In some ways this is good as it feels a lot safer walking around the city. Especially so for those travelling by yacht or custom car (which I wasn't but clearly in this area quite a few people do).Just go and see and enjoy every aspect of Barcelona - I have been 6 times now and would go back tomorrow. I just love it, I'm not bored yet and I haven't exhausted the place. I hope you love it too."

It is full of shops, restaurants, historic sites and the most magnificent Cathedral. A very different environment from the Gaudi architecture seen all over Barcelona. This is much more old Europe style.The Cathedral costs 7e to enter. The admission fee includes access to the roof top observation area. Well worth the cost. The Cathedral alone could take 2 hours to visit.the Gothic Bridge is next to the Cathedral as well. Very unique. The shops and restaurants are full of character. Some chain stores but many local stores as well.Plan to spend a few hours in this area exploring all the little gems in the Gothic Quarter then head to the Boqueria for lunch and then have gelato in La Rambla's main avenue."

Enter from right side, for free, to see the garden first, and then proceed to inside. Also, by that entrance is a small plaza with best free wireless (the unlocked one). You can take a book with yourself and spend a lazily afternoon here. Note that you have to be dressed properly to enter the garden and the church. Best take a shawl with yourself just to be sure. Of course, there is always someone to sell you one. The church is best to capture from outside around 16h-18h. There is a tourist office nearby, but don't go there! The tickets they sell are double price than when bought online or at place and they are very incompetent to help you with anything else (The good tourist office is at Palau Robert). There is also a lot of shopping stores and Happy pills is my favorite (next to that tourist office). For 6,5\u20ac buy yourself as many candy as you can put in a medium bottle. It will last you for days and it's very yummy. Also, the mini bottles (2,5\u20ac) make best gifts. Be sure to visit Picasso museum, also."

Visit the Cathedral and then go around it to the left and enter the Museu d`Hist\u00f2ria de Catalunya where you will find a wonderful museum that showcases the original Roman town. The museum has many informative displays about the history of Barcelona and then you go down in an elevator to the remains of the Roman city. The site is very extensive. Well worth a visit."

It runs to the side of the main tourist spine of La Rambla and offers plenty of small 'boutique' shops and pista, pasta/ paella restaurants. Weird shops, parlours, you name it. Slight seedy feel in places but everyone just a on with it. We stayed in Plasa D'agla and was close to La Rambla and the sea."

Little taverns, we tried so many small eating places, wish I had their names.... all great! Larger places where the food platters are outside to choose from, you MUST try the seafood platter with the razor clams, WOW! We found neighbourhoods where the children have only asphalt squares to play in, but others where there was a large sandy area with playgrounds, dogs barking in top floor apartments, we really saw Spanish life. We also stumbled on some of Gaudis more hidden masterpieces and were delighted. Well worth a walk, souvenir places with gorgeous things, shops selling amazing things, window frontages that are so spectacular you take a photo...it doesn't end. Small clothing shops that sell just what you wanted for 10 euros! Then neighbourhood shops which have to be seen to be believed, more of a homes front room, they invite you in.... The archways overhead, the buildings themselves, the feel of this gothic place, the depth of it is something I will always remember....if you get a chance come here and just wander...."

The place is generally heaving with hordes of tourist so it can be very difficult to really get a feel for the place. However visit early morning and you can walk about without the crowds - the only people you meet are locals going about their business.As you might expect there are restaurants and cafes everywhere.

There is so much variety in a relatively small area that easily bored children will always have something to amuse them, wether it be quirky shops dedicated to selling only rubber ducks or quality ice cream sellers.Just hop off the metro and roam around is my advice. Be mindful that if you enter the cathedral, which is relatively good value, ladies in particular, you will be expected to cover your shoulders and upper legs if wearing short shorts.

Unfortunately, the place is also covered with graffiti which litters the place. I wish the city would find the way to fight it somehow. Highly recommend going into the shops to look around. Many of them are much bigger than they look from the outside and host art exhibits or museum arts. Also, many shops carry their own design hand made items like clothing, shoes or jewelry. A fine example is La Veintinueve boutique selling shoes designed by its owner and hand made in Barcelona."

Barcelona is a place that is not preoccupied with perfection, but obsessed with living life in the now and you can tell this from a visit to the Barri Gotic. There is a lot of graffiti, some quite good, a lot of it average, almost all of it deliberate, a lot of empty buildings but it never feels edgy, just funky. The range of eating places, clothes shops, butchers/bakers/candlestick makers is amazing. I basically spent two days there and didn't get bored, neither did my teenage kids."

The Gothic Quarter\u2019s buildings pays homage to the Catalonian capital\u2019s (Barcelona) medieval heritage. Beside the grand Cathedral there is a 2,000 year old Roman temple. A notable story relates to the plague where apparently the Christians blamed the Jews for causing it. The theory is that the Jews washed more frequently than the Christians (who bathed once a year!) and that the Jews traded in silk, whereas the Christians dealt in wool and the plague was spread by fleas off rats. As more fleas in wool, they were never eradicated so the plague kept reappearing. Many Jews were slaughtered by the Christians. An odd story but there are many others relating to this area of tiny streets/laneways where it is only possible to walk. There are some amazing places of interest and you have to walk it but do so only during daylight as it can be dangerous at night. Having said that, I did go to a Flamenco Show in the Old Quarter, did feel some trepidation walking thru the narrow streets with one other, with groups of young men staring at us. We made it out safely but I would not do this on my own. There are many bars and restaurants also to explore in this area. You can\u2019t go to Barcelona and not spend time in the Gothic Quarter."

The streets are narrow in places, and it's easy to stumble across unexpected things, whether it's a shop, Roman ruins, a cathedral, etc. I would agree with what others have said that it wasn't as Gothic as I had initially expected. Some of the small side streets are quite dirty, but we've visited places that are significantly worse, so it didn't bug us too much, especially since most of the areas are quite clean. We spent the better portion of two days exploring the area. We took a walking tour our first day with Runner Bean, which was awesome. It was a great introduction to the Gothic Quarter, and we actually went back and explored more of the areas we didn't have time to check out on the tour the following day. We got lost a few times, but that was when we came across the biggest surprises! It's worth spending a few days exploring here, because there is more to see and do than initially meets the eye."

A meander through the Gothic quarter of Barcelona, accompanied by a guide, guidebook, app-filled smartphone or a knowledgable friend will yield an afternoon's delight (no, romantic couples, not that kind!).Religion plays a central role in Barcelona's history, as protagonist and instigator; so unsurprisingly it is much in evidence in the quartier Gotico: churches, relics, streets named for a vast variety of consecrated or nominal saints. Narrow pedestrian paths with sharp angles seem suitable only for walking but one encounters the occasional vehicle trying to navigate the alleys, containing either a harried and nervous tourist or a small delivery van driven by a relaxed local, or occasionally a bicycle rickshaw. If not for the cobbled streets, it would be ideal for roller skates.Besides being an opportunity to hear colorful and imaginative stories, make sure you stay hydrated, taking a bottle of water with you, along with a capacious bladder. Restaurants and bars or toilets are not as much in evidence as in the rest of the city."

This tour company far exceeded the 2 tours I took with Julia Travel. Turisme provided a map of all the sites we saw. Each person was provided with a headset so that we could hear our guide. The guide added some suggestions on what to do for fun in the square later in the day. This was a great tour."

The name definitely suits the feel and design of the buildings in the area and walking through it in the evening can be romantic and at night, well thats when all the freaks come out and play, early morning(before the street cleaning crew) you can smell the urine and the after effects of the previous drunken night activities."

Take a look at the tragic past of the Spanish Inquisition when visiting the one of Europe's oldest synagogues. Don't miss the church Gaudi attended, often filled with playing children."

Although there is some controversy about the \"authenticity\" of the Gothic part of Barcelona there is enough mediaeval quarter left to enjoy. Remains of the Roman temple of Augustus are apparently present but not being an archaeologist I cannot confirm. However there are enough alleyways and many small streets opening out into squares. Most of the quarter is pedestrian only which means you can wander around with some freedom and examine the buildings at close quarters. Some of the buildings have undergone reconstruction at some stage but they still fit into the overall Roman city. You are likely to find the City Hall, the Palau de la Generalitat, the Cathedral and other Gothic buildings, such as Santa Maria del Pi and Sants Just i Pastor churches. In the Gothic Barcelona one can also find the old Jewish Quarter, and the remnants of the old synagogue. Although it is still very touristy, and close to La Rambla this part is more attractive part of Barcelona."

The Gothic Quarter has been named after the fact that it once used to be a Roman village which has since been fully absorbed into the city of Barcelona, and if you know what to look for, there are still signs of this fact all around you. Be prepared to get neck ache, as you need to spend time looking up, not just along or down, otherwise you will miss all sorts of interesting architectural features that make this part of the city so special. It is the mix of the old and the new that brings people from all over the world to stay in the Gothic Quarter. The Gothic Quarter is full of placas (courtyards) where you can relax, take a breather, grab some food and drink and enjoy the scenery, but to get to them you have to wander through the narrow streets and admire the architecture above your head, or perhaps if that is not your thing, window shop, peeking into the vast array of wares and goods on display. Many visit the Gothic Quarter at night, as it is vibrant and alive, with all sorts of bars and restaurants, competing for your attention. The night-life in the Gothic Quarter is lively to say the least and you will always find somewhere to have a drink or a dance. Expect to get stopped or be handed a flyer, as you wander around. Some even go so far as to almost drag you into their venue, but don't allow this to happen unless you wish to go inside, as they work on a commission. The narrow streets are stuffed with shops, and you will quickly max your credit card if you enter some of the more up market venues, because this is just one of the places in Barcelona where you will be able to purchase designer goods, or unique one offs that have been hand made. It is a great place to visit day or night, so enjoy yourself, get lost in the wonder of it all and most important of all, thank whichever god you happen to believe in, that you are in Barcelona."

Could hear people still going strong (well as strong as they had left in them) at 0600 when we got up for tour. It's loud. It's obnoxious. It's exciting. Love it!!!! Tapas till you tap out"

I admit that during my first visit to Barcelona, I was afraid to navigate these streets as a solo female traveler, so I took an inexpensive walking tour that was offered by the local tourist office. However, since that initial introduction, I feel that the streets were all-along tourist-friendly. So, if you want to visit the area on your own, without a guide, I would recommend that you access it off of Las Ramblas and enter through Carrer de Ferran. Ferran will eventually open into the Plaza de Sant Jaume, where the tourist office is\u2014in case you need help or a map. If you continue past the plaza, Ferran turns into Carrer Jaume and then it is called Carrer de la Princessa, which leads you to the Picasso museum\u2014if that is your interest. Otherwise, I would recommend using the Plaza de Sant Jaume as your reference point in navigating the gothic streets in that area (left of the plaza if you entered via Ramblas and Ferran). Look for the beautiful gothic bridge between two buildings off of the plaza, and that street (Carrer Bisbe) will take you to the Barcelona cathedral. If you want to meander prior to going to the cathedral, you might take the street right of the bridge street. It will soon bend right and straight ahead of you will be a building, in which is the Temple of Augustus. The Roman temple has been enclosed by medieval apartments\u2014a fascinating sight. The temple is free but well-maintained, so don\u2019t be afraid to enter it even if it\u2019s a little neglected by the main tourist crowd that tends to take Carrer Bisbe instead of this tiny (nameless?) neighboring side street. Once you leave the temple, you can continue along this small street which will wind to the back of the cathedral. Once you see the massive structure, you will know that you are not lost, so just enjoy the surrounding architecture and follow along the edges of the cathedral. You will also pass the cathedral\u2019s cloister gardens on this route, so you might head inside and then access the cathedral through the garden entrance. Once you build your confidence in exploring these dark, narrow streets, adventure through the rest of the gothic quarter. There are so many gems to be found here! Shoppers will especially be pleased by the unique stores. My favorite is the Basilica Galeria, a jewelry-lovers haven (off Carrer Bisbe at Carrer Sant Sever)!"

It gives a good idea of how Barcelona was before much of the old city was knocked down to make way for the Olympic construction. It is a good contrast to the new Barcelona. There are lots of little shops, and near the Cathedral there were some beautiful modern sculptures. The cathedral is worth a visit for the art and architecture and it only costs a few euros. Look out for the amazing shoe shop, a huge range of leather shoes and they are reasonably priced."

For adults, the architecture, the history and some of the local hip shops are really fun.A must do if stay more than one day in Barcelona.When eating or ordering a glass - copa - of good wine always go one or two streets away from the tourist venues and listen if some of the customers are speaking catalan or Spanish. The wine will be better and cheaper. And the locals are very, very, very friendly with children especially if you try to say two or three words in Catalan."

As we wonder along, we arrived at the Basilica de Santa Maria del Pi. Signed up for the 11.00am guided tour that includes visit to the bell tower.Its a true example of Catalan Gothic architecture. Were impressed by the massive stained glass rose window. The highlight is the climb up the narrow stairs to the top of the bell tower....here we were rewarded by a good aerial view of the surrounding Gothic Quarters and enthralled by the hourly ringing of the church bells.

This is a very important place to visit if you are in the City, Barcelona has a wealth of amazing buildings thanks to the likes of Gaudi, but Gothic Medieval churches are often over looked which is a shame. Okay i love in yorkshire and we have quite a few of these floating around but this is a great example, plus if you are brave they do a rooftop tour, when i visited health and safety was optional and tourist had an argument with security, but it was an experience. i cant really find fault with the church itself, it was a stunning example of a gothic architecture filled with loads of relics and murals and a few tombs etc, but was annoying was how little it was valued by the city, in the UK places of worship like this tend to have some grounds surrounding them , greenery and trees , where as here houses were bulit almost up to the walls of the church which i felt was quite sad."

This neighborhood is stunning but check this out with out the credit card in hand - spot the great places to find treasures and bargains and go back again I a focused mode. Otherwise it can and will be costly ;O)So many rare places to see and a million of shopping opportunities, but as said save them to a more focused mode - and just cherries the architecture and the environment during your walk through this magnificent area of Barcelona.Take time to se the Cathedral (beware of the \"small skirt\" declaration - women need to cover their legs!! - men don't ;O)At the tourist info you can see scaled models of the Nou Camp Nou + the history behind this - quite interesting - and the staff here are kind helpers to find way to explore Gotic even further."

But you find find this in many European cities. Many historical city centers in Italy are far more interesting. If you have limited time, I advice to visit other unique things in Barcelona, such as Sagrada Familia, Palau de la musica and the Modernist houses in the Eixamples (Casa Battl\u00f2, casa Mila, etc). Otherwise, go for an half day in Barri Gotic, and you will not regret. Visit the Cathedral."

There is impressive architecture from the old city as well as preserved ruins. There are historical landmarks of the city, for those of you that are into History.

It is exciting, but beware of purse snatchers and other surprises. In all, any traveler would know how cautious we must be, but this is such a fascinating area of Barcelona that you have to experience it in fully awareness in order to truly enjoy it.

Coming from a cruise ship, we checked into the Tryp Apolo and decided to walk to the Cathedral of St. Eulalia in the Gothic Quarter to attend Mass. While the main avenues are wide and easy to travel, the side streets are narrow, stop and start at angles in small plazas and make finding your way somewhat difficult. It took us longer to find the cathedral than planned and we arrived half way through Mass. The cathedral is beautiful but because Mass was in progress, we could not view the entire church. There is no charge to visit the cathedral. Next door was the Museo Diosesano with a permanent exhibit of Antonio Gaudi. The museum has an entrance fee. We spent an enjoyable hour viewing the history, influences and examples of his work. Walking around the area we saw the remnants of Roman walls and other museums we did not choose to visit. This is a very interesting part of the city and worth taking time to visit. Walking tours are available (for a fee) if you are interested."

It is well worth the tour's 2-plus hours, some steady walking, and a nice tip at the end for one of Sandeman's excellent free guides.

Ok it's touristy but who cares. The Barcelona Cathedral is a great example of where more works - more gold, more stain-glass windows, more intricate details. Don't forget to take the lift to the top which gives a great view of all of Barcelona - only 3 Euros. Been to Barcelona 3 times & the magic of this area always surprises me."

The Gothic quarter of Barcelona ( Barri Gotic) is a centuries old, atmospheric area with beautiful architecture and mysterious laneways mixed with bars, restaurants and boutique shops selling ceramics, prints, art materials, shoes, chocolates and clothing.Leading off Las Ramblas, the medieval Gothic Quarter has the Barcelona Cathedral as the main focus point (if you get lost within the narrow streets, you can usually see the spires to reorientate yourself). Highlights of the Barri G\u00f3tic include Barcelona's cathedral, the political hub of Placa Sant Jaume, the medieval Placa del Rei (Royal Palace), the Temple d'August and the city's Roman remnants, the Palatine chapel of Santa Agata, Picasso Museum and the Museum for the history of the Catalan. The area is worthy of at least a day's exploration-and even then you will not necessarily see all that can be discovered. Be prepared for a lot of walking: start early in the morning when the area has a quiet about it (and the tourist throngs have not yet arrived). Because the roads are narrow and cobbled, most are closed to regular traffic and are more or less pedestrian walkways- which makes for pleasant walking. And don't worry about rest stops throughout the day- you will find many small, inviting Cafes for coffee and pastries or bars and restaurants for sampling a glass of Vermouth and and plates of tasty tapas!"

Used the \"Walk Roman Remains\" in the \"Time Out\" Barcelona guide book and was amazed at what was still remaining. You must visit the Roman Remains Museum which was the highlight of the trip. The Gothic Quarter also a fantastic place for eating and shopping and just wandering around and digesting the surroundings. What also should not be missed, and it's very hard to do so, is the Cathedral. The cathedral is free to visit but the Roman museum entry charge was 6 Euros but it also includes free access to many other areas of historical interest."

There are heaps of restaurants offering tapas mostly, we located one off the main straights and found it excellent. It was still a touristy street but much quieter than most, I would avoid the streets where you see no tourists! Most streets look the same but worth wandering around without a route plan as it was easy to find our way out of."

So I find myself one morning at its birth, the Barri G\u00f2tic, or in English, the Gothic Quarter. I am lost, and I love it. The medieval city of Barcelona, the Gothic Quarter is a sprawling city ripe to explore. The only way to explore it by getting lost in it.I find immersing into the history of Barcelona particularly challenging, especially within the Gothic Quarter. Being the largest medieval city that remains today, it's confusing to navigate for the first time and to discover the sheer wealth of history. Half the time I am lost in this city, and the other half trying to remember what I've seen.The streets are so narrow, the buildings are so close together that catching a glimpse of anything but what is in front of you was difficult. Perhaps this is the reason I find myself lost all the time here, there isn\u2019t a visible marker that i can get my bearings from. But I felt this adds to the charm of the city. I talk a lot of being lost here, but I find that being lost here was the best part of my experience."

We were able to walk to every museum and site we wanted to see, eat at many wonderful restaurants like El Melic Del Gotic, a delightful off the beaten path restaurant and MILK a nice place to grab an early breakfast and coffee before sightseeing. I have nothing against McDonalds, Starbucks, or Hard Rock but do yourself a favor. Unless you have kids pleading with you, don't go to the same places you can visit at home.

Look into the air and you will see balconies so close across the narrow street that neighbours could shake hands. To the north is the cathedral and the south the prominade. The streets are full of small shops bars and tapas eateries. My personal preference was to keep going east to La Ribera and El Born. The cultural centre at El Born gives a great insight to the port and its changes through the ages. This facinating former market building is a free attraction."

Totally car free and cobblestoned narrow 4 to 5 story buildings press up against neighboring houses and suddenly you turn a quick corner and you could be standing in front of the open square where the Cathedral is ( started in the late 1200's) or by the Piacsso museum.

Much of Barcelona was torn down and rebuilt in the mould of modern industrial trends in the late 19th & early 20th century (evidenced in the 2016 exhibition at Palau de la Virreina). The Gothic Quarter is the exception, combining the delights of an older Barcelona metropolis with the detritus of modern tourism. Quaint narrow streets are as thronged now with visitors as they would have been with traders in the past, and the aim of parting visitors from their cash remains as strong. If you look beneath the usual souvenir tat, the smaller cafes are great and the sights worth visiting. Be prepared to queue for timed tickets to venues & wander round just looking in between."

The streets are winding, narrow and confusing but there are shops, restaurants and museums galore. Fabulous place to wander if you have a day to spare. If not, try to see some of it anyway. There Is a church with easy access not through the quarter and there is an ancient synagogue near the church since this was the old Jewish Quarter. Access is easy from La Rambles and you will find better food deals here than right on the main street. You can save a few Euros for a tapas and beverage and enjoy some plaza time since there are plazas all throughout the quarter."

Take in mind it was early week in March so quite cool (maybe 8- 10 degrees ... mid 50's ). and raining one day. The buskers, musicians and human statues were not out. I imagine from what I've seen and heard the summers are active, crazy and downright amazing.

Loved the whole experience. But be careful many of the small alleys were a little intimidating with groups of youths and some beggars. The strong smell of urine in some of these also stopped the whole area being 5 star. But I still felt safer than any American, British or German city."

As one of my favorite things to do in Europe, wandering around the narrow alleys and local neighborhoods, the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona did not disappoint. It is so easy to loose yourself in these meandering mazes and discover some treasure around each corner, without getting totally lost. The Jewish Quarter, the Picasso museum (the building itself is worth seeing) the different pla\u00e7as and mercats, churches and cathedrals. You can have Las Ramblas, I'll take the Gothic Quarter. Just in case you are worried about getting lost, which is hard to do, just walk in one direction for several blocks to get your bearings. But pull up the map on your phone when on WiFi in your hotel. Then use the GPS when out wandering around. In some spots you will loose GPS accuracy, but just walk to a more open area to regain the accuracy. We used this method to locate a hard to find gem of a restaurant called La Vinateria del Call. Make reservations and give yourself time to find it."

Everywhere you look is a remarkable building with gargoyles. Everywhere you step, you realize that thousands of years worth of people have come before you. Christopher Columbus came here to try to drum up money for his trip! Street artists, walking tours, bike tours, it's incredible. BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS.

As the main Catalan Gothic building in the city, the cathedral is spectacular both outside and inside. Its many chapels all dedicated to particular saints are all remarkable works of wholly crafts. Many visitors come to pray.The Gothic vault above the Carrer del BisbeThe cloister is also home to 13 geese that symbolize each a year in the life of Sainte-Eulalie, to which the cathedral is dedicated.

It goes back to the Roman times and once in a while you see some churches or buildings with foundations exposed and it shows how this neighborhood was built literally over thousands of years. Since it's been lived and developed all that time, it's not a \"no touching\" exhibition. The streets are still narrow but people do live here, so you can easily imagine how it was back in the days. Frankly, I don't think I need to say more. If they idea of walking the narrow streets lived for a couple thousands years sounds attractive to you, you'll love this place. If not - give it a try, and if it's not your cup of teat - Las Ramblas are just a couple minutes away, so you can't lose."

It is remarkable how interesting and exciting it is to explore the seemingly chaotic virvar of small streets, usually ending up in charming, cosy and peaceful plazas or squares. You have to take care not to stumble when exploring the Gothic Quarter as you tend to always look up to admire fine architectural details of old building facades, the spires of a small church or a basilica or cathedral or the many public sculptures placed in strategic places. When your neck is tired of looking up you can instead look inside the many special shops , bars, cafes and restaurants which are in abundance in the area. Do not forget to admire Julio Nieto's sculptures in Pla\u00e7a Nova, in a shady corner, just outside the Villa del Arte, or enjoy the ambience of Plaza Sta. Maria del Pi, where the basilica of Sta. Maria del Pi is also located. Remember to give this visit more time, as there are so many things to see and do here."

My best friend lives here as she is studying medicine and I always visit whenever I can. The city is fantastic but 'El Barrio Gotico', where she resides, is a whole other city compared to the rest of Barcelona. Being the old historic center of Barcelona you can tell and feel the history of the place simply by walking through its tight alleyways filled with small shops and restaurants. The variety of foods is absurd and I have had some of my all time favourite dishes here, along with a great variety in prices if you look well enough. Situated next to La Rambla, one of Barcelona's most well known areas which is always buzzing with life even until early hours of the morning, it is extremely easy to access using Barcelona's metro. Although it has never happened to me in many times I've been, Las Ramblas and the Barrio Gotico are notorious for its pick pockets. Just be alert and you'll be fine. The lovely beach of La Barcelonetta is a few minutes away walking down by the port and towards the iconic 'La Vela', as it is commonly known, hotel which sits on the coast. If you visit Barcelona, you must come down to this area, as for myself at least, it is easily the best part of an absolutely amazing city."

The 15th century buildings surround you, the sounds of the past whispering thru the winding lanes. The presence of the handsome, busy construction workers scurrying between the ten inch walls, half hidden by sheer drapes, testify to the constant loving care these ancient structures receive as upgrading and renovation occur even as they keep the appearance of the past. It does not matter if you lose your way, all roads lead eventually back to a large plaza where the protesters, the tourists and the Barcelonans deal with life today."

Plenty of interesting, historical features which you could fail to spot if you don't look in the right places. Could spend hours here, was beautiful to stumble across many buskers in this area late one evening, all remarkably talented which was just perfect to stand and admire in such a beautiful area and city. 2 hours felt like 2 minutes!"

Full of character and colour. One word of warning.. sound really travels, so if you want a quiet nights sleep choose your hotel carefully. Ours was stunning but we chose a balconied room overlooking the street so I could watch the world go by.. however the flip side was the street carried on til 4 in the morning on friday and saturday. It would have been fine with the double glazed french doors shut, but I like fresh air so ended up stuffing loo paper in my ears because of the street noise!!"

This is Barcelona's gritty, exciting and hugely interesting Gothic Quarter, puts you in close proximity to the Boquieria, Las Ramblas and much else that is well worth seeing. I will be returning there this month. This is an excellent base for exploring the city and has lots of great eateries, some wonderful architectural gems and is jam packed with Barcelona's great history and Catalan culture. Can't recommend it highly enough.Barcelona's Gaudi attractions are really worth seeing especially La Sagrda Familia also worth looking into the Travel Bar Free Walking tours where the guides are veritable fonts of knowledge who will get you under the skin of Barcelona.If pinxtos, tapas and great seafood and steaks float your boat then you'll be more than pleased with Barcelona."

This afternoon I went for a stroll with my partner into the Gothic district.The Cathedral was amazing with huge pillars at the front keeping up the main spire.I don't think that I have ever seen so many side altars in a cathedral. The Cloisters provided quite a unique touch with yet more side chapels, but a nice quiet area for the monks in the past, with live geese to give it an authentic air.We went up the lift onto the roof. It was nice to see another high profile view of the city and it certainly highlights what a miss-mash the architecture is.We then went for a stroll through the tall, narrow streets which seem unaltered in centuries. We found a nice cafe for a drink and snack in 'George Orwell Sq' We then took a stroll along a st which seemed to specialise in pizzas, before emerging at the tail end of 'The rambles'"

When I first lived in Barcelona in the mid 80s the Barrio G\u00f3tico was a rather scary place, old, rundown, overtaken by the seediness of a big city that was already at a low point. Fast forward 30 years and I don't let a visit go without wandering at least a half day if not a full through the tiny streets that make up the now alive areas of Barr\u00ed Got\u00edc and El Born.At every turn there are new and interesting shops and restaurants, and as long as you are far away from Plaza Catalunya they are almost all one off shops, with little connection to big retailers. On our last trip we found a wonderful little toy store with carved wooden letter puzzles from a Bulgarian toy maker, on the trip before that an olive oil decanter with a Picasso theme (ok, that shop was more touristy than I usually like, but I'd been looking for one for a while and really liked the one I found). Shop owners are worried about the gentrification of the area and the fact that the personality of the Barri\u00ed is getting priced out of the area. That would be sad, and it is something to watch for, but at the moment I relish those hours during every visit there."

It's an easy walk from La Rambla (where my hotel was located) and has several points of interest.The Catedral de Barcelona is a beautiful Gothic church, full of history. I followed along reading my guide book about all the chapels, and learned why the choir is placed in what seemed to be an unusual location (not so unusual in Spain, though). Nearby is the Gaudi Exhibition Center, a small but very well-designed museum about Barcelona's most famous architect. I definitely recommend this if you have any interest at all in art, mathematics, architecture, urban design, or Gaudi.The Muesum of the History of Barcelona (MUHBA) was also excellent! You get to walk down through the archaeological remains of Barcino, the original Roman city. The Picasso Museum is also nearby, and I'm sure it's a good museum (one of the few in the world dedicated to Picasso) but the layout was a little confusing.It's easy to lose your sense of direction as you walk through the narrow streets and alleyways. Watch for the brown signs pointing the way to various points of interest. Also, Barcino was built on a hilltop, so if you notice a slope, going uphill will take you back in the direction of MUHBA and the Cathedral (which I used as a center point for exploration)."

Any time is fun for strolling the incredible medieval Gothic Quarter, but the break of dawn is my favorite. It's quiet with just the early morning workers hosing off the streets and alleys. The bakers are preparing their croissants and there are very few people around. No tourists that I ran into. The architecture is awesome in this old Roman village and the streets are intimate. There are restaurants, cafe's, bars and shops. Look for the Cathedral in the heart of the district."

Great little walk where you will be fascinated and amazed at the architecture on the buildings which line both sides of the street. I was so captivated by this splendor that the majority of all the pictures that l took, while in Barcelona, were of the buildings and the monuments. I would strongly recommend that you join many of the walking tours that are available as the locals are very well informed on the history of the buildings, churches, monuments and area."

The following day, I took a two hour walking tour of the Quarter through the Barcelona tourist office. While the tour was primarily in the area right around Plaza Sant Jaume, the tour guide provided a lot of historical information on this section of the city and highlighted its importance since the Roman era. We also visited the Christmas market and received a good (though graphic) explanation of the Christmas log and other Catalan Christmas customs. All-in-all, the Quarter was an excellent place to visit for at least half a day and I would recommend the walking tour. Although you can visit without a guide, it increased my enjoyment to have the additional information."

You can explore narrow little streets where you will find shops, restaurants and tapa bars. Sometimes the streets will open up into a square with a church or food market. It is just fun to walk around and enjoy this area. It is safe and less expensive than some of the more touristy areas like Las Ramblas . There are some good hotels in and near the Gothic Quarter."

The first time I would go without any guide, even completely alone, and get lost there and see where it leads me. Almost everybody speaks English so you can always ask for your way. The second/third time I would take a tour. I never took a walking tour, I took a Segway tour. The good thing about it was that you get to be MORE a parrt of everything. If you\"re riding something, you are one of those who have to negotiate their way not only in the narrow streets but also between all cyclists, vans, skaters, dogs, bikers, motorbikes etc. And they have to negotiate their way with you. A perfect example oh human cooperation. And nobody gets angry with each other, except for some tourists :)I felt completely safe all the time. I walked around late at night, alone, nobody bothered me. Nothing got stolen although I am not particularly careful with my things and guides and waiters constantly lectured me about it. Some people ask for money but if you say no, they leave you alone immediately. All the small alleys are also perfectly safe, at least for me.The place is full of dogs, many of them run free. I love the pet-friendlyness of Spain.The crowds on Saturday nights can be a bit overwhelming though."

Take a day to just roam the area. It is filled with the magic of Barcelona. The creativity and the history will inspire you to dig deeper and appreciate the storied past and the spirit that keeps this place humming. I would recommend a tour but be aware of your space. It is crowded with tours and some large groups seemed to take over the street. We had a small group and our guide was super conscious of common courtesies to others. We stopped in at some beautiful churches and were able to admire the relics. The shops are artsy and contemporary. Sadly, not crazy about tapas but we were able to find some lovely spots to eat and then tasted our way through many delicious bakery shops lining the streets."

El Barri G\u00f2tic (Gothic Quarter) is located in the center of Ciutat Vella (Old City), in the area between La Rambla and Via Laietana, and from the seafront up until Ronda Sant Pere. It is one of the most famous landmarks in Barcelona. This District is made up by a fusion of buildings, from Roman settlements to 20th century structures, and the overall atmosphere is gothic-like. The Gothic Quarter is easily recognized by the antique aspect of the buildings, its narrow streets and the near absence of traffic. Many of the streets are for pedestrians only and are built like a well-organized labyrinth, many of them leading to small squares.Main places to see in the Gothic Quarter:Cathedral of Santa Eul\u00e0lia. Barcelona\u2019s main Gothic Cathedral is located in the heart of the City, between V\u00eda Laietana and La Rambla.Bisbe Irurita Street. This gorgeous pathway leads from the Cathedral to the Sant Jaume Square, and has one of the most photographed bridges in Barcelona.Sant Jaume Square. The administrative heart of Barcelona. Here are located both the Palace of the Generalitat (Government) and the City Hall.Church of Santa Maria del Pi. The 14th Century Gothic Church, along with its 54 meter high tower, which can be viewed from La Rambla, is one of the most incredible structures on the District.Pla\u00e7a Reial (Royal Square). One of the biggest tourist attractions in the Gothic Quarter. Is an animated square, just off La Rambla boulevard. Lined with palm trees, bars, restaurants, outdoor cafes and street lamps designed by Antoni Gaudi, it is a popular meeting point and one of its liveliest nightlife spots.Pla\u00e7a del Rei (King\u2019s Square). One of the most beautiful corners of old Barcelona, the 14th Century square houses the Museum of History of Barcelona."

Its typically Spanish, or Catalan rather and is full of Christmas decorations and relics for nativity scenes, very traditional. It runs from early December until Christmas Eve and is certainly worth a visit when you are in Barcelona in December, you can visit the xmas market and have a walk around and through the Cathedral. You'll find plenty of Ti\u00f3 de Nadal known simply as Ti\u00f3 (a big piece of cut wood) is a character in Catalan mythology relating to a Christmas tradition widespread in Catalonia. Another charming Catalan tradition is to add a funny character called 'caganer' to traditional nativity scene \u2014 you know, the usual suspects of Mary, Joseph and the shepherds gathered around the baby Jesus in his manger \u2014 There\u2019s no delicate way of putting this so the most polite translation is \u201cthe defecator\u201d as, despite an innocuous-looking appearance from the front, its buttocks are bare with each one containing a small, brown deposit beneath."

Some Roman walls are found here as well as medieval buildings and narrow alleyways from a history that includes the Phoenicians, Visigoths, Romans, Turks, Moors and French amongst other civilizations influencing Barcelona. The politics of Catalonia are evident in their flags everywhere. The art of Gaudi is seen in the lampposts he designed for the Pla\u00e7a Reial, or in Picasso's museum or in the Castellers sculpture at the Pla\u00e7a de Sant Miquel. There is the historic and dominant Cathedral of Santa Eul\u00e0lia and 3 basilicas in this area, the most inspiring of which is the Basilica of La Merc\u00e8. The elegant city hall is here topped with the 2 flags, the wax museum close to Columbus statue and of course the Grand Royal Palace. Catalan traditions include the sardana dance usually seen in front of the cathedral or the many statues of St. George, the dragonslayer whose day is April 23, celebrated with roses for women and books for men. Of course, no mention is complete without talk of tapas, had everywhere in side streets but best away from Las Ramblas. Two famous places are El Gran Cafe and Les Quatre Gats. Two other gems are the Jewish quarter and the Palau de Musica but my favourite place was Museu de'Historia de la Ciutat a subterranean exhibit of Roman ruins - free on Sunday afternoons after 3. This area is accessible from the Liceu or Jaime Metro stations. Be careful about your possessions. This place is renowned for pickpockets...."

It is a \"must see\" for every tourist from Boise to Bavaria and for every pickpocket from Bucharest to Burgas. The latter come here for the crowds of easy marks, narrow streets, and ineffective laws. Purse snatching is a petty crime that will get you hauled off the street for a while, but rarely long enough to interfere with your work schedule. So pickpockets are everywhere. The best defense is to keep your purse over your shoulder or your wallet in an inside pocket. Don't dare put backpacks down to tie your shoe and when in an outdoor cafe, anchor one strap under the leg of your chair. When someone bumps you, immediately bump back and go on the defensive. Pickpockets usually work in teams with one to distract you and the other to rob you--then both disappear before you know it. Barcelona is a very civilized and friendly city except for this plague of locusts; and until the laws make purse snatching a major crime, you had best beware when in the Gothic Quarter."

The labyrinth of the Gothic Quarter spreads over some 2 square miles from the central park to, beyond its western side, the chaotic Rambla. This whole area consists mostly of narrow pedestrian streets and alleyways. Some are dimly lit at night and directions come be confusing so, if you are going to wander around like a tourist in the evenings, a map would be useful. There are tapas bars and restaurants in abundance, many of which have excellent ambience and are generally very good value. A lot of these have outside heating, so it is nice to sit and watch the world go by as you enjoy being served by the generally very pleasant waiters. Visit the Born Cultural Centre near the park - a restoration project of the old market building, the central area has been excavated to show 300 year old remains of old Barcelonian houses - the centre has an interesting bookshop an excellent cafe for an evening stop for hot chocolate and local nougat, a speciality of Barcelona."

Tourist shops may be regrettable, but the small, narrow, crooked streets contain so much more. It's a real neighborhood, for one, and there's nothing thousands of tourists can do, really, to change that. There are real buildings, some of them from hundreds of years ago; there are real shops where real neighbors shop. It's littered with gothic architecture, in a way that used to be true for Paris, but which is now extremely difficult to find in that post-Haussmann city. In the Barri Gotic, you can get the flavor of 12th or 13th century (or 14th) Europe over an impressively large area.Well, if you're a tourist, and you're in Barcelona, you're inevitably going to go to the Barri Gotic no matter what. What you might not do is really get down and walk down every single street and go into every single church or every single other architectural delight in this neighborhood. Believe me, this area is crammed with so many interesting things, you could spend your whole time here and not even get close to exporing the whole place. But I highly recommend giving it a good try. And, what's more, the Born is as interesting and various a neighborhood as Gotic, and it's right next door. Good choice you made to come to Barcelona!"

The Gothic quarter is near so much that can be walked to, or are just a short cab or metro ride away. The old Jewish quarter, the cathedral, (and great market next to it weekends), the Palau de Musica which is so awesomely exquisite, La Boqueria (fabulous food market), Barri de Gracia, El Born, Las Ramblas, places like Casa Batllo, La Pedrera are within walking distance if you have the stamina to do so. My husband and I are in our sixties and found it no problem to walk with a couple of cab rides. Also don't miss the Basilica de Santa Maria del Pi which had a Catalan Market and art market next to it, and the oldest street in Barcelona."

The Gothic Quarter was a perfect change. The winding narrow streets, where some can easily be lost, end up in charming sunny plazas.My favourite place was the Viceroy\u2019s Palace. The graceful arches, the noble staircase surmounted by a fantastic coffered ceiling, the St George door recently made but quoting history, all of them made the visit enjoyable.The Gothic Cathedral of Barcelona dominates its area, and that is the place where I managed to lose myself. Even to be lost was fun.Of course we went to see all of the must-see places, the Carrer del Bisbe, which isn\u2019t old, but so iconic, that everyone take a picture of it (including me). Visiting the Placa Reial was just by accident, but we fell in love with it right away We strolled on the decorative narrow lane the Carrer de Petritxol to arrive to Basilica Santa Maria del Pi. It is situated on the Pla\u00e7a del Pi, a delightful plaza in the \u201cBarri G\u00f2tic\u201d of the city. On thePla\u00e7a de Sant Jaumein in the amid of the Gothic Quarter.

These to impressive palaces are full of history, The Gothic District is the heart of the city,and just as beautiful and important part of Barcelona as the Gaudi buildings.Just don't forget to visit the Picasso Museum.."

Incidentally, the subways are easy to negotiate. If you're going to be in the city for a few days, I recommend that you buy the 10 ride ticket for about 10 euro.

The secret is not to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of tourists rushing from one sight to the other. Just \"pull over to the side\" and look at the shops, door knobs, detailed entrances and meander from street to street!"

Bring a map, but get the most out of it by booking a tour through any of the tourist information offices. Fun places to see (old roman city gate, Picasso museum, Museum of the History of Barcelona...all awesome!) Great places to eat whatever you like, and.....chocolate! Churros and chocolate-just do it and diet later. Trust me on this. Oh, and Brunell's, next door to the Picasso museum, has fantastic traditional Catalan pastries and chocolate, too.Many of the streets actually end up at a major street, such as Via Laetana or Las Ramblas so it's not like you won't be able to find your way out again."

Despite other reviews we did not witness any pickpockets or crime and felt quite safe (obviously taking great care of our bags etc). The Placa Reial was a lovely lively square with restaurants all around where we enjoyed a good meal. We were warned by our Segway tour guide not to be in the area too late at night though as it gets quite rowdy when all the bars open."

I grew up in a city and thus was forced to develop \"street smarts\". Every city, regardless of where it is, has warts. For Barcelona, those warts come in the form of pick pockets. These folks are world class, I mean really really slick. I was tested several times. It is like a sport to these folks. Do yourself a favor and leave the big purses at home. Wear an inside wallet or other apparatus and you'll be fine. Keep your eyes up and be aware of your surroundings just like in every other city.Oh man!! The wine, the cheese, the tapas, particularly the octopus.......was fantastic! They KNOW how to make this stuff in Barcelona. The whole vibe of the place was nice, oozing with character and charm, and locals were super friendly. Just about everyone there spoke english, but take a little time to learn the basic dialect in Catalunya and the locals open up even more. Respect the culture and the velvet ropes will part!

I and my wife got lost here several times -- and enjoyed every moment - looking for the Synagogue, and then the Shoe Museum, then a place to eat. Unlike centros in other cities, this old city is relatively clean and the shops unique with goods not found elsewhere. We stopped for wine and snack, for espresso and a pastry, looked at things to buy that we did not and found this a wonderful place to be busy and chill out at the same time. That said, if you are not a walker, and want to take a peek, you can cut over from one of the larger avenues and spend but a few minutes seeing what this part of Barcelona looks like."

I can't think of any where such a small area packs in so many attractions. Athens comes to mind, but really things of interest are spread over a larger area as they are in Amsterdam, Lisbon, London and Paris to name a few. If you are spending more than one whole day in Barcelona then allow at least one day here and you won't run out of things to see,You'll need either a good large scale map (say 10,000:1) or have a data connection for Google Maps or similar. I was here every day for five days and I found I could still get totally turned around by the labyrinth of tiny alleys and squares. That's part of the fun but of course if you do get lost then often you can't see the sun to get your bearings so it can be frustrating.One way to start is with the Barcelona Historical Museum which gives you a (mostly) underground tour of the original Roman town and some of the early churches. The Barcelona Cathedral with its geese and the columns that remind you of the Sagre Familia would be a must-see. At meal times be sure to shop around as prices vary greatly and the quality of the food is generally good so comparing a few places can easily save you ten euros per person (or more).The Picasso Museum is just to the north of the Jaume I metro station so while technically not in the Gothic Quarter its only a few steps away."

This is the old neighborhood were all the working class, guilds, and general population use to live within the city walls. The city was built as a Roman colony back in the beginning and developed inside these walls during the Middle Ages until times changed and it was forced to expand beyond the walls. The Gothic quarter is full of specialty craft stores, small restaurants (the good ones), and small squares close to Sta. Maria del Mar and other important gathering points. I guarantee that you will be coming back to it during your walks hoping to find something new. You have not visited Barcelona unless you spend some time here."

Although the buildings seem large and the traffic busy there is a lot to see here. The top end around the square is good for designer shopping. You can walk all the way to the sea front on the Ramblas. Lots of side streets and alleyways can be explored. There are rooftop restaurants and even aroad where all the Irish bars are. At night the streets light up. There are market stalls and a feeling of good holiday atmosphere.It is the area to look at the old Architecture. Just off Catalunya square you can get a bus to the seaside resort of Sitges. This cost 4 euros each way and is about 40 mins. ride. Well worth a day out. I repeat, a street map helps to point out the landmarks. You could just stroll up and down the Ramblas and enjoy what you find."

The Picasso Museum is free on the first Monday of the month.The streets are narrow and extremely charming , filled with tiny shops and great restaurants. Visit the Barcelona Arc D' Triumph on a broad boulevard lined with period street lights. Don't forget the Rambla a very wide street with a boulevard in the center , it becomes teeming with people all day long. We had the best Vietnamese food in the Gothic and fabulous Local food at reasonable prices. People are very friendly . I look forward to another visit. BUT beware Barcelona has a huge pickpocket criminal element , my traveling companion was a victim at the subway station. These are professional thieves who prey on tourists."

This is probably my favourite area of Barcelona, but admittedly it's hard to choose.I think this area is best discovered late afternoon after seeing some of the 'big hitters' or in summer after a day at the beach. Full of character and charm it has many independent boutiques, ice-cream parlours and interesting cafes, bars and restaurants.The El Born area of the district was once a little down-trodden but it's now a cool area to spend the night amongst the trendy bars and clubs. It's like the Olympic Port but without the pretension and price. It gets busy from 11pm - 3pm and it's friendly and safe and my favourite place to spend the night."

In the evening the place comes alive with music, performances and bars and restaurants. Lots of places to eat and drink. Little shops to visit offering similar tourist goodies and some unique ones. During the day you can appreciate the beauty of the architecture. Worth a visit!"

Starting at Placa Catalunya in the center of town we walked down to the waterfront visiting shops, cafes, & bistros.

We took the Fat Tire Bike Tour which starts in this section of town which is a good way to see the sights in this area."

This neighborhood is very easy to find, safe to walk and centrally located area close to the center of Barcelona - Place Catalunya - as well as the Cathedral. I was a little dismayed to see the commercialization of the area to the many different stores and cafes and restaurants, but the area still has the original charm due to the very narrow and organic street system. Until about 9 pm many of the streets are wall to wall people. It is close to Las Ramblas, another of Barcelona \"musts\" and also close to the Place Catalunya. We went through the area many times during this stay (we have been in Barcelona a couple of times before) since we chose a hotel in this area for this reason and ate/drank at tapas places several times in this area."

Going down La Rambla there was all sorts of life going on, people queueing to get on buses, people feeding pidgeons in the square, musicians playing outside department stores, stalls selling all sorts of food and tourist gifts.

The streets in the area are a little confusing, you think you might be lost, but if you walk a little further you will end up on a main road because the area is so small.

IF you want souvenirs you can get plenty at the gothic area.on the weekends they have a market right in the middle of the souare. there are many good hotels in this area. everything is accessible from here. you can taxi to the beach or see the other important sites. The only thing to be cautios of are the gypsies who come around i packs and could pick your wallet or bag easily.don,t wear a lot of jewellery that would draw attention to you. on the whole a wonderful experience to go or stay in the gothic area .We have stayed there about six times, and would gladly return again anytime."

My sister and I went in to the Cathedral, tickets were \u20ac7, very beautiful to look at and so magical to experience. There are some stunning paintings and frescos if you enjoy art and a separate area to sit and pray. The architecture of the quarter is beautiful and for a history buff like me its a wonderful spectacle to actually see, the magic of it doesn't translate in photos and pictures. I felt that although the quarter is sandwiched by shops and restaurants it was able to stand apart and not be diminished by this, unlike my experience of the Trevi fountain in Rome. I would definitely make this a must see during your stay in Barcelona."

Stop in some of the neat little shops and maybe stop for a snack or drink at one of the little patio cafes in one of the quaint little squares you stumble across. It will be interesting and likely disorienting, but it will be an unforgettable experience. I was lucky enough to be staying in the neighborhood on my recent trip to Barcelona, so the husband and I wandered through the neighborhood daily. I loved every minute of it! Something to keep in mind: If you're traveling alone, be cautious about walking around here after dark. There are many dark corners and alleys where ill-intentioned people could lurk. I didn't see anything or anyone that made me worry, but it's always best to be extra mindful of your surroundings."

I suggest u sit in a pew and soak up the atmosphere in order to get the full experience of the expanse of the interior of the church. unlike a French gothic which has high windows, Spanish gothic windows r smaller because of the heat of the Spanish sun. like all gothic cathedrals, however, there r 12 side chapels well worth a visit. some hold medieval reliquaries. be sure to visit the cloisters (gift shop) and the 12 swans of st. eualia for whom the church is named. the gargoles on the church r human; the gargoles on the civic buildings outside the church r animals because a cathedral cannot have animals on their roof. there is a roman museum worth a visit nearby. it will introduce u to the underground world of the original 3rd century cathedral and the roman city surrounding it. st james square is renaissance and if u peek past the guards on the city hall there is a lovely view of the interior garden. therer tourist shops and cafes around the square so after u have pic I suggest u pick any land off the square and wander the labyrinth of streets where it is easy to imagine knights on horseback and folk visiting inn keepers lining the lanesif u r adventurous walk towards the water and visit the small medieval church where the sailors and peasants attended services and see the statue of Christopher Columbus. u can easily spend a day or two in the middles ages here."

It has really great access to the beach, las rambas, markets and some incredible historical sites. The little streets in this neighborhood are also just great to wander around and get lost in.I would suggest finding an apt. to rent if you really want to feel immersed in the area. It can get loud at night and I don't know if the hotel windows combat this issue but I really liked opening all the balcony doors and feeling the pulse of city. Also, the architecture and decor of our flat was incredible and certainly added to the experience. Well worth the value too.I always felt safe in the area although I was super aware of my purse and belongings at all times. That's a must in Barcelona and especially in the busy markets and tourist attractions. Ladies, do not leave your purse on the back of your chairs, ever!The rickshaws are a fun way to great around in this area. We always found one near the boat docks or las rambas.I read some great views before going and wasn't disappointed in this charming neighborhood."

As you consider touring through Barri Gotic, and other tourist areas, just a short note to be mindful of your belongings.Thursday, 20 Aug, I was shopping in Padevi, a shoe store in the region, and my purse was stolen. The staff were unhelpful, and no cameras in the store for evidence. I also heard stories where the thieves walk alongside you in busy areas, repeatedly dipping their hands into your bag. Barcelona lacks the infrastructure to support you getting your items returned. Be sure to have your passport ready if you want to report to the police. And if you're foreign, they take the reports only when a translator is present - costing you multiple trips. The city's Lost&Found is equally unequipped for supporting. They require the serial number of your ID card or other cards. That is, they can't file your missing cards/ID, etc... they'll need the serial numbers for these in order to input in the systems.As with any tourist attraction, it makes sense to be aware. I noticed over my few trips to Barcelona that the topic of thieving has grown, with more police force present, yet no true solution yet found."

They hang their washing out, show their national and football allegiances with flags, grow plants, drink coffee and talk to neighbours all above your head as you wander about. Some little alley ways have no shops. The beauty of the Barri Gotic is how it contains so many different facets but they all blend. Cycles and scooters glide past pedestrians, sometimes you walk past a car park unexpectedly and a car appears as from nowhere, and you marvel that there is enough room for it to pass through the narrow streets.We spent 3 days here and got to know just about all of the streets. Many of the shops just sell tourist stuff, but there are some very stylish shops, antique shops etc, as well.

Lovely narrow histories streets lots of lovely shop /boutiques selling usual gifts a bit pricy for the tourists not as busy as la ram las which was nice to get away from the crowds we went to a tapas bar it was disappointing for not great the staff were miserable could be bother the waiter was rude pity we could speak Spanish then we would have understood what he was muttering as he walked away from the table !!! It was a shame as inside the Resturant was decorated in the old style very gothic which is why we choose to eat there thinking it was more authentic .another day in the gothic area opposite the caters we had drinks at another tapas bar which was very good friendly staff it was morgen inside white furniture tapas bar with stools good price too"

The Tourist map doesn't name individual streets so best to download one. If you take in the water front, it makes for a full day out with lots of little squares, quirky streets, shops and restaurants but without a map you will get lost!. We didn't mind but you may have other plans. The cathedral is well worth a look inside. Considering it was August, there was a good atmosphere."

When I first arrived in Barcelona I saw this classic Spanish architecture and thought wow amazing out with the camera like many others. I wandered round the maze of streets a few times night and day and did not experience even the slightest hint of the danger which travellers are advised to be aware of in The Gothic Quarter. In fact the atmosphere was quite pious with quite a few nice churches build into the area. Barcelona Cathedral is also splendid, free to view and worth calling in at. Towards the end of my stay my perceptions of the area changed somewhat as I mused whether I would or should feel the same way whilst strolling around the back alleys of old terraced housing in England. The large amount of graffiti also lowers the quality of the experience as does the desperate litter situation but the Spanish authorities cannot really be held accountable for that because with the huge volume of tourists walking and cycling the area they cannot possibly keep up and constantly maintain a clean zone. There is also a few open squares and many shops selling food, a superb range of souvenirs and really delicious ice-cream which goes down a treat during a hot days sightseeing."

No short-shorts, tank tops or hats. We saw many people turned away. There are women selling scarves right outside the Cathedral to cover shoulders which is one of my favorite things brought home.

I strongly suggest you wander down the small streets and soak in the atmosphere and the amazing architecture."

The streets are beautiful and kept so clean that the public can reminiscence in Barcelona's history and view how Barcelona has changed today. Every night the streets are being washed down. During the day the streets can sometimes become a little busy, at least during June/July when we visited though still far quieter than a trip down La Rambla. Nearly everyday we went through the Gothic Quarter and was by far the best walking experiences we did. We also took a couple of free walking tours to experience the Old City through a company named RunnerBean which took us through many of these small streets too.

The reviews I had read about the Gothic Quarter did not give it the credit it deserves, I found the quarter a totally magic place with endless narrow streets and alleyways, each leading to new finds, shops, bars. When the Cathedral appeared in front of me at the end of one alleyway, I was amazed I had only walked a few minutes from the Hotel (EL JARDI), Then next alleyway took me a shopping street with which led onto the PLACA CATALUNYA. Going in the opposite direction and in 10 minutes I was on the sea front after just following the narrow alleyways. Explore the Quarter and be excited and amazed at what you find ? I spent 3 day exploring the quarter and LA RAMBLA and cannot wait to go back ?"

They are full of little surprises: inlaid tile images on the walls, tapas restaurants, medieval and Roman buildings. The Cathedral is definitely worth a visit, but women must have their shoulders and chests covered. The plaza in front of the cathedral is an endless source of entertainment."

These are the real deal. We ate in several of the spots in this neighborhood and didn't have a single bad dish. Tapas everywhere.Wandering around, pay attention to what's up in the air. We saw Picasso's original studio in a building that is locked shut with a chain and looks like it could fall over. The carving in the fa\u00e7ade of the buildings is ornate and interesting. This was a very Bohemian area in the day and looks to continue the tradition for the most part today.Barri Gotic was one of the best walks we took, and don't worry... If you walk long enough, and are totally confused as to your location, you will eventually find your way to a main road where there are plenty of cabs to get you back to where you want to go."

Every time I discover more interesting buildings, more quaint corners, more attractive little shops, more appealing eateries and bars. Layer upon layer, the more you walk, the more you learn to distinguish the various stages of the city --Roman, medieval, modern... On one building, today a museum, you suddenly notice the sign of the Inquisition; on another, you can spot tombstones from the old Jewish cemetery that were recycled for construction. Full of surprises, the Barri G\u00f2tic has much to offer --the impressive Cathedral complex, the Jewish Quarter, Government Square, the various buildings of the Museum of the History of Barcelona, and so much more!"

Don't forget the Quatre Gats (Els 4 Gats), in the north part of Barri Gottic (just off Ave. Portal de l'Angel) for a drink, coffee, snack or tapas. This is where Picasso and his friends hung out in their younger days."

There are small shops which sell tapas, some boutiques, chachka stores, many restaurants, and divine architecture.

The public bus will take you to its walls from the sites such as the Olympic village or Gaudi's Sa Grada familila cathedral. The Old town is the universe of its own - charming, mysterious and stimulates our imagination. One feels the centuries that passed by within its walls... On the outskirt stands Cathedral de Barcelona, one of the most beautiful gothic architecture in the world. The square in front of it fills with the Spandiars on Sundays who engage in square dancing. Worth watching how serious they take the tradition! The cobble stoned, crooked and narrow streets offer a lot of coffee shops and boutigues, in case you do not care waiting for the last minute souvenir shopping at the airport."

Tours are very thorough, so I highly recommend getting on one, through the Office of Tourism, which is right at Plaza Saint Jaume. A walking tour, that will explain the history of Barcelona. It is worth your while to learn of this history, and we bought our tickets on-line, like so many of the activities that we did, and walked in to meet our tour guide. Always best to book ahead.

Three good things to be aware of:1) The cathedral requires covered shoulders!! Girls, guys, keep that in mind, or they won't let you in.2) The bottom's of the terraces - they are sometimes with coloured tiles. The more colour and tiles, the richer were the inhabitants! So watch for bottom's of terraces with more or less colour, this was an interesting way that the residents showed off :)3) There's an area right around the corner from the Cathedral, called the \"Centre Excursionista of Cavalunya\" - It's a great little hidden doorway. Inside, there are 2,000 year old Roman columns, mixed with Gothic arches, and a ~1900's building - it's a free duck-in, and it is exactly what the Barcelonian's prided themselves on - Modernism, the mix of different styles in one building!"

There are many little bars, restaurants ( which by the way many offer great ore fix lunch menus) at great prices. Walking through the gothic quarter allows you to experience Barcelona through the eyes of a local. In this neighborhood,myosin will,find the cathedral, ( wonderful in appearance), the Picasso museum, el Palau de la M\u00fasica (music palace)... I experienced what it would have felt like many many years ago in barcelona. I frequently have visited Barcelona and this neighborhood is by far one of my favorites. The only negative thing I would say is the tourism during high season, but if you visit during months of January through March or even April, you have the opportunity to stroll at your leisure and cover the entire gothic quarter. For those who enjoy night life, nearby you have The neighborhood, El Born, which attracts club goers as well as a varietyof pubs and lounges. All,of this to enjoy at a reasonable budget!"

You'll also find Museu Picasso, the Cathedral and many other museums.There are many restaurants and stores to occupy your time in addition to the wonderful history. Many buskers hang out here and provide a nice soundtrack to your wandering. We heard a couple of arias coming out of an alley behind the Cathedral, which was really cool.It doesn't have to be a destination by itself, but if you're around the area, drop in, you won't be disappointed in this great neighborhood. Great architecture, great sights, great sounds. Don't miss it."

Most of restaurants are acceptable and with reasonable prices. Be very carefull with the pickpockets they are like ninjas. \"do not leave your baggage unattended\" should be clealry posted there. A good place for cheap shopping, drinking and eating tapas and this kind of stuff. Flats are very small and with small or inexistant windows. Weekend noise can make people living there crazy. I dont recommend the flats there if your are concerned about noise and drunk people. Check water pressure, kitchen appliances, and electriciy before renting there, remember that most of the buildings have more than 200 years."

There is no defined Gothic Quarter at street-level, it is more a defined area on the map, so unless you go on a tour or have a good guide book it is easy to wander off piste and end up in some seedier streets between Las Ramblas and Parallel. Not that they are particularly threatening - I think the risk of pick-pockets in the city has probably been over stated - it is just that they are not that interesting, one street seems to be one mobile phone shop after another. But around the Cathedral there is a warren of narrow medieval streets and squares with nice, interesting shops, restaurants and cafes. Keep looking up - a lot of the best architecture is above the shop-front level - but this can be difficult with the crush of tourists oblivious to everything but what is in the lens of their camera. To do real justice to this area - including plenty of sampling of the cafe culture and people watching - allow a full day at the minimum."

Across the street from the museum is the massive Mercado Boqueria where you can find almost any kind of food, flowers & such.We headed over to the main Cathedral, then to theold Jewish section, had some tapas along the waythen over to the Picasso Museum for a visit. Along our path were several sites of Roman Ruins, churches,small Placas and a few small museums. A spontaneoussong & dance group started performing in a pedestrianstreet while playing guitars! Near the Picasso Museum is the awesome Palace of Catalan Music-a must see. We ended up back at the Placa de Catalunya where we picked up some wine, meats, cheeses, and bread for our room at the wonderful deli in the basement of El Corte Ingles department store.The main tourist office is under street level of the Placa de Catalunya . Here you can find tours, Barcelona Cards, Metro passes & such.During the evening hours the Ramblas is very popularfor walking & several clubs for music & dancing arescattered throughout the area."

The beautiful cathedral is here too, and although I'm not a religious person, I did make me feel a little spiritual. There is a lovely bridge in the style of the Venetian Bridge of Sighs, I never found out what it was for but certainly worth looking out for."

There is so much to see in Barcelona's Jewish and Gothic Quarter that we were very glad we had hired a private guide through Emily Mathews, owner and manager of South O'le Spain Tours who also provided private guides for Segovia, Toledo, Seville, Cordoba, Granada, Ubeda and Baeza and three days in Barcelona. In addition to seeing the 15th c Palau de la Generalita and 14th c Town Hall, the 12c Roman Baths and 1st c B.C. Temple d Augustus, we spent most of our time in the El Call (Jewish Quarter) comprised of very narrow streets. At it's height, there were about 3500 Jews and 5 synagogues in this section prior to the Jews expulsion. The Call de Barcelona was founded in 1997 to educate about the Jewish history of Barcelona. It manages the 1267 medieval Mayor Synagogue (the oldest in Spain) which has two small rooms, one of which can be used for services. When we were visiting, there were numerous tour groups so there is limited space or time to look around. Nearby is the MUHB El Call (Museum of History) which opened in March 2015 in the former home of a Jewish weaver. The museum has two floors of excellent displays of Jewish life in el Call and a glass floor over roman ruins. There was good signage in English. This is one of the best Jewish museums we saw in Spain."

There are tours daily but they might not be open on a Saturday or holiday. Call first. The street that the synagogue is on is not on any map. Tell the cab driver to drop you in the square where the city hall is. Walk to the far side and go to the street on the right. Take the first right and go 1 block and make a left and it is right there. It is charming and has an interesting history and your contribution helps continue the restoration."

Explore the small streets off to the sides. The Cathedral is a \"must see\" according to most guides - although it is not that different from a lot of other large cities and there is scant information available. The history museum is the find of the area. Amazingly extensive Roman remains under the city. Stunning and hardly anyone seems to know that they are there."

This section of the city is chocked full of historical and cultural buildings all back lit by the small shafts of Barcelona sunlight that slice through the alleyways. You will want to visit this area to get a feel for what it was like to live in a city in medieval Catalonia. One way into the Barri is off the Ramblas. Once inside, you can wander for a long time through the narrow streets that open up into open air squares with cafes. At night, these places are lively establishments, with concerts and flamenco dancing. They are lit up by open fires that beckon the traveller to sit and stay a while. The beautiful medieval Church Santa Maria del Pi has nightly guitar concerts for a fee of $10 and is located off the Placa del Pi in the Barri Gotic. The architecture of this quarter dates back to the early Roman days of Barcelona. There is an intact wall at the Roman entrance of the Barri. The Jewish section or, el Calle, is the most fascinating part of the Barri, with its very narrow streets where the rooftops almost touch. Europe's oldest synagogue, Sinagoga Major de Barcelona was rediscovered during an excavation and has been open since 2002 as a museum. Worth a visit. Around the streets of the Barri Gothic, you will see a story of the city, from the Roman founding to the coat of arms of the Inquisition, which is still intact on the walls of buildings and a reminder of the brutality of medieval life. The bricks stolen from Jewish cemeteries embedded in the walls for Churches are another reminder of the brutality of the middle ages and the massacre of Jews in Barcelona is 1390 and their eventual expulsion in 1492. Moving forward in time, the Royal Palace where Isobel and Ferdinand received Columbus after his journey to the new world is found within in a central square of the quarter. The painting of their meeting and the palace was made famous by Euguene Delacroix. There are also some nouveau creative gems to behold in the Barri Gothic, as a touch of Barcelona's love for modern art can be viewed on doors and windows. Even the famous graffiti artist, Abraham Clet has left his mark in the district. There are many tours available to help guide you through the labyrinth of streets. I strongly advise that you choose one that will take you to the parts you want to see and also to take the time to wander at will."

We used a walking tour described in Rick Steves' book on Spain.If you are in town on a Sunday, visit the *other* cathedral in Barcelona, located in the Gothic Quarter, between 1100 and 1300 hours to view a live band and hundreds of dancers performing the Sardana, a traditional local dance.We stayed in the quarter at Hesperia Barri Gotic, and ate all but one of our meals in the many little plazas in the quarter.Picasso's museum is also a must-see in the quarter.Charming small streets, well lit and felt safe to walk through at any time of night."

Our intent was to see the Cathedral, but that didn't happen that day. We stumbled through streets and lanes and nooks and crannies. We saw things, like the Temple of August and the museums we would return to but this was about adventure and discovery. To have this treasure in the heart of Barcelona with so many portions intact is remarkable. I was surprised how busy but not packed it was that day. When we did La Rambla it was more of a forced march for all the people. This was busy in a good way. people could get by and there was space to stop and look at things, ornamentation work, shops, etc without causing a roadblock. We probably went back through there three more times on missions but what a great place."

Fortunately, it was. It is. Getting lost in Barri Gotic is an important part of every visit. It leads to one fantastic discovery after another, from great bars that don't open until most of us are in bed to secluded restaurants that open just as late and where you're the only visitor. It can happen. It's an ancient part of the city, and that makes it a neighborhood worth getting to know."

It was hidden, as the streets were built on top of old buildings, until the 1990's when workmen realized they were excavating on top of a building. They stopped immediately and found the synagogue. It was then that a donor gave enough money to rebuild what was left. You walk steps to get inside, no ramp for the disabled, and there a lovely girl, Carmen, gave us a tour, very short as not too much is left. She then took us inside of what remained of the actual sanctuary (where the men prayed) and gave the most interesting talk. The women's sanctuary is behind a wall where a restaurant now stands. Even of you are not of the Jewish faith, I heartily recommend this stop on El Call St, as it is a very interesting part of history. Keep yours eyes open as you walk down the street as you can easily miss it. It is near the cathedral, which, is a must stop also."

I have been several times and loved it, but I was apprehensive at first, wondering just how to look out for thieves, given that we were a family group with children. Robbery this time was in the crowded metro though, entirely the fault of my son-in-law trusting his back pocket. The Barri Gotic robbery was an earlier visit when my husband making a phone call in a square at night (back pocket again - will these men never learn?) had his purse taken. There was a most entertaining pursuit, me after the thief but husband standing there. I kne I couldn't catch him, but my voice could. I would run about 20 steps then let out an operatic scream. I was enjoying myself enormously though If I had thought I could catch him, I would have stayed put,. We raced into the side streets, then he sped off. When I finally got back I asked my husband why he had done nothing. He said that it was irritating because he liked the purse, but there was only the equivalent of 30 p in it. I'm telling this because other travellers may find a moral in it, or probably not."

I highly recommend the small Roman cementery just of Las Ramblas, the much larger Roman archeology underneath the history museum, and the museum for the early years of Picasso.

Barely enough room to walk four abreast in many places. Watch out for the occasional motorbike navigating the corridors.

Try to research the restaurant if you wish to dine in the Gothic Quarter because many are tourist traps.

There is almost no car traffic within the quarter which made it that much more enjoyable. We stopped here after visiting La Boqueria, and had a great time walking throughout the quarter.

You could wander for hours around the small streets, taking hundreds of fantastic photos (I know I did!) Lots of graffiti on the shutter doors of shops when they are closed, I thought they were fantastic myself! Being right in the middle means you can always pop back to the hotel to refresh and then off you go again. Very close to Las Ramblas which is a bonus. Also only a stones throw from the main bus route to the airport. We didn't feel threatened or scared in this area, it seemed so safe. Lots of police presence which helped too. So glad we stayed in the Gothic Quarter, if you choose here, you wont be disappointed!"

Great shopping, from Tourist Shops to Chocolate Shops, Clothing to Antiques. In the evening the winding and narrow streets come alive with troves of locals mixing with tourists.

A lot of it is closed on Sunday, so other days might be better. Several museums to visit as well, but we did not have time to stop at them. Walked down to the port area and returned along the Ramblas. The Barri Gothic is definitely less touristy than the Ramblas.

Barri Gotic offered charming little narrow streets with old, medieval houses and passages leading to surprising squares, churches, domes and administrative buildings.Given the houses were somewhat tall and the streets narrow, sun could barely get in and this provided a lot of shade - which is especially enjoyable in hotter months.Not only is the Gothic Quarter enchanting by itself, its location is very convenient, too- 5 min from the port, 10-15 to the beaches and 5-10 min walk to Las Ramblas and around 15-20 min to the bus station. Loved the mix or locals and few tourists, which might have been due to the season we visited (March), thus maintaning the genuine medieval feel."

Many other squares had works of art.The Barri Gotica is about a 15 minute walk to the beach, but the two areas are separated by centuries."

Pla\u00e7a Sant Jaume is another place (you can be lucky to see the Castell sometimes during festivals).But a favorite pastime is just strolling the streets, try to get a glimpse inside some of the fantastic courtyards and cloisters hidden there and enjoy some of the more expensive shops in Barcelona.Barri Gotic is not only for tourists, actually you'll find many local in the narrow streets and squares in the quarter.Unfortunately, due to it's popularity it's also a place where you can be subjected to pickpocketing and petty theft - but if you follow some simple guidelines for not parading open bags, wallets in back pockets, and the like it is no problem at all.An enjoyable place, which you shouldn't miss."

You'll be amazed by how gorgeous the balconies and adjoining stonework are. Each building seems to be different, and that's because unlike what you would easily assume, they have mostly been built between 1600 and 1930, and thus each have their own time's style. Not surprisingly, the narrow alleys sometimes are home to the most surprising buildings, and you'll often run into hard-to-find-again bars and restaurants where you'll mostly encounter locals. It's a different side of Barcekona, just steps away from the paths all tourists take. Explore and enjoy!"

Of course the smoothness means there are lots of bikers and skateboarders but it is all good. There are many many small shops and restaurants to find. We found good chocolate and good food and good wine. Lots of people are walking by so it is also great for people watching. There is also still areas where the Roman aqueducts are visible, just incredible. The area felt safe to wander with plenty of police and other security."

Yes, it does draw tourists, and retailers are happy to oblige. However, the narrow streets with surprise openings onto charming squares with a cafe, the pulse of history and the joy of just following your nose to wander is part of a great vacation to me. We were there in early March, before the big tourist season, so I'm sure there are more crowded experiences. We walked to our hotel from dinner one night when all the stores had closed. The people who lived there came out, their dogs ran around the empty streets and greeted friends, and we saw that the area also housed residents who called it home. The streets are closed to cars during the day, but on off hours the stores and restaurants need supplies and all the deliveries begin.I'm glad our hotel was near the quarter and we enjoyed cozy little cafes for dinner, easy stops for gelato or a mid-day snack, there's a cake cafe for a leisurely dessert with tea or coffee -- cafes are set up for you to just grab something very small and then linger and enjoy."

Tall buildings, narrow streets and lots of shops to explore. There are also plenty of eating places to stop and rest and replenish your batteries! There are lots of people about so be prepared for crowds of other people moving about within this area as well as yourself. The old cathedral is well worth a visit and to see the cathedral's guard geese and their pond! Be prepared to encounter public demonstrations in the main square of the Gothic Quarter. These are peaceful and well policed. People appear frequently to demonstrate in this area but these gatherings do not last long. The people gather, make their protest in front of the main public building and then quite quickly disperse while life goes on in the Gothic quarter. It is just part of the local tradition within this area of Barcelona. The Gothic Quarter is easy to navigate around with the aid of a basic tourist map. As previously highlighted this is a must see area if you visit Barcelona."

The Picasso Museum is in the Barri Gothic located in 3 old buildings. They have an impressive and comprehensive collection of his work donated by his wife Jacqueline and his best friend and private secretary Jaume. You should try to take a walking tour around the Gothic quarter just to orient yourself otherwise it's a tad confusing. I love the atmosphere which is bohemian and arty at the same time historic and cultural. You can see lots of beautifully executed graffiti on the walls, a testament to the artistic inclinations of the Catalans."

As you would expect, all the large department stores plus hundreds more small ones for something different at excellent prices in the gothic area. Loads of narrow alleyways to explore as you soak up the history of the area. Stayed at the Petit Palace Garden Hotel excelent rates for a couple and friendly accomodating staff. Special diet breakfasts served with no fuss, with a good selection. Being placed just a few metres from the spectacular Les Ramblas you have easy access to bars and restaurants galore. Here are just a few places we tried and very much liked :- Workers Restaurant on wherelse than Workers Street, find it by walking up the Ramblas on the left, look out for a narrow street running diagonally of the Ramblas almost at the top, the restaurant is on the right approx 30 metres along the street. Amazing value - menu del dia, 4 courses, choice of 3 selections per course incl. wine or beer or soft drinks, water for a grand total of 11.50 euros, this is where the ordinary people of Barcelona eat. Get there when they open, 1 o clock in the afternoon, it fills up fast! Next try the tapas bar opposite the Theater Oprea House on the Ramblas. Look carefully for this one, you can easily walk past, its just a single glass door with a window on both sides, old in appearence. Step inside and go back to the early 1900s, excellent selection of food and beers at reasonable prices. And finally, KINO a small bar run by 2 of the most soft spoken Irish lads from Cork serving wholesome food and beers at good prices. Find KINO at Carrer Feslandia 23 up near the Unniversity.

The city has a reputation for pickpockets and crime so i thought i would share my thoughts. If you are victim of crime it will most likely be non violent, ie it will be some while before you realise that your pocket has been picked. Whilst walking back to the flat at 1am a man walked towards me asked me the time, i told him and then he raised his had towards mine to shake my hand and as i went to respond i realised that the situation was going to develop into something i couldn't control so i simply ignored the handshake and walked the opposite way. I had gone a few feet and there was a second man waiting in the shadow of some bushes. I carried on walking and looked back and waited for them both to move on. Before i had gone out for the night i made sure all my cards and most cash were not on me. I was going to the Harlem Jazz Club and there had been some thefts there so i just had cash for the night. Sometimes i would stow certain things in the hood of my coat, thieves will normally go for back pockets of trousers and inside jacket pockets.So travel light, leave bling at home, head down and keep walking, stop for no one and avoid distractions. Have a great time, we did."

We spent many hours walking around the area, down narrow alleys, into small shops, dining at small restaurants tucked into old, old buildings. We never knew what we would come across when we went down another street or alley. Early mornings and evenings were very special with the lighting and fewer people on the streets. The architecture is spectacular whether you wanted to just observe or take hundreds of photos. I think I took about 300 photos!! The larger squares by churches were full of people (spring time brings many high school spanish class tour groups!!!!!) sitting, wandering, eating. We felt safe wandering up and down streets. We were warned about pick pockets so we took note and wandered around with money zipped into pockets or in safe places."

They are filled with souvenir shops peddling little swords and shields, or post cards, or other things dedicated to the past. The Barrio Gotico is different. It is a legitimate city, alive and vibrant, with markets that sell real produce to real residents who do normal things, like go to school, work as plumbers or taxi drivers... All in buildings that date back centuries. As you walk through the crowded streets, you get a sense of the thousands of residents who have passed before, and unlike Rome, or Rothenburg om de Tauber, or Carcasonne, or other cities with a cumbersome presence of history, the Bario Gotico has a sense of future as well, fueled with Catal\u00e1n pride and demonstrated in the myriad hip and fresh little shops, bars, caf\u00e9s, and restaurants."

Dating back to Roman times , the original settlement of Barcelona was situated here. Most of the buildings date back to the late Middle Ages and later centuries. The area is full of restaurants, bistros and shops as well as homes.  The streets are narrow and winding so it's easy to get lost. Bus tours can not negotiate these small streets so you have to do it on foot. I would suggest that you start at La Ramblas and head north or start in the north at Pla\u00e7a Sant Jaume Metro stop and head south. There is a midieval church and a few museums to see near Placa Sant Juame as well as a wax museum just off of La Ramba.  The shops are small and interesting. There are some cars and motorcycles so you do have to be aware of what's going on around you . The food offered here is different from what you find in tourist areas like La Rambla. There is more choice and often the prices are better.  I picked up a pastry and a banana for my breakfast one evening here. . It's cheaper than a hotel breakfast and just as nice.  There are bars and nightclubs but we did not go into any of them so I can't say what they are like. I would suggest spending 2 or 3 hours wandering around in the late afternoon and having supper there before it gets dark. After dark it's harder to figure your way out of the area.  I would say that the Gothic Quarter is well worth the visit."

Easily accessible through La Rambla, the medieval streets and small squares can take you back in time. These old streets remind me a bit of the \"calle\" of Venice, they just pull you in deeper and deeper and invite you to wander aimlessly in them. From Placa Sant Josep Oriol to the streets surrounding the Cathedral, you can continue on to Santa Maria del Mar and Passeig del Born, which belongs to another quarter (Born). The point is to lose yourself in these charming streets, there will be many interesting shops, cafes, and sights for you to explore along the way. It will also be a nice surprise to see some local and \"avant-garde\" designs shops against a backdrop of Roman and medieval Barcelona."

The pictures doesn't do justice to how beautiful this place is.There were many attractions within Gothic Quarter, museums, churches, plazas and the city hall.We went to Museu Frederic Mares, where it housed hundreds of sculptures and collections. I was truly impressed.

There's fresh fruit sold everywhere, and you get to see the old churches, tiny homes and a labyrinth of streets that never surprise as you turn each corner. This place provided the perfect excuse to get lost in a bit of history and truly immerse yourself in an unknown world."

            "review": "The Gothic Quarter - Then & Now. The \u201cBarri G\u00f2tic\u201d? Despite the name, you should not expect to find it full of pasty-faced loons, all dressed in black and sporting enough metal to make a knackers-yard boss slaver. It refers to an architectural style in vogue between the XII and XV centuries. The area includes the Cathedral and surroundings that stretch down to the sea-front which, until 1990, was part of the commercial quays and port of Barcelona, the other side of Via Laietana (the wide road was built starting in 1908 and involved demolishing great numbers of buildings) encompassing the Santa Caterina Market over to the Arc de Triomph and, again, down to the sea-front after skirting the Parc de la Ciudadella which houses the zoo, a hot-house and the Catalan Parliament, and the Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a.Although you may think the Cathedral is the place to visit, OK, it's alright. THE church to visit is Santa Maria del Mar. In the early seventies I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing here and that was a very moving experience. The acoustics are fantastic. And, talking of singing, for the Christmas Midnight Mass (called la Misa del Gall - Cock's Mass - in Catalan) they sing a choral version of The Song of Sybil (Cant de la Sibil\u00b7la) a Gregorian Chant from the 10th Century which foretells the end of the world. That will really make your bring out the goose bumps. A moving experience in an outstanding setting, even for those, like myself, who are not believers.This was an area of Barcelona for the rich and noble; evidence of which still exists today. Leaving aside the obvious indications of the Cathedral, Palau de la Generalitat (seat of the Catalan executive and the Prime Minister's Offices), the Town Hall building across the Square of Sant Jaume from the Generalitat, and many other official buildings and museums that have been installed in the mansions of the nobility, the whole quarter is dotted with \u201cpalaus\u201d. The lazy translation of \u201cpalau\u201d would simply be \u201cpalace\u201d; however, at least in my mind, the word \u201cpalace\u201d conjurers up images of a splendid building housed in vast estates in the country. Whilst these edifices were certainly splendid in their day, they were (and are) far from isolated. In general the landed nobles and gentry lived next door to each other in the city and visited their domains infrequently. A better translation would be town-house or mansion.The Picasso Museum (Carrer de Moncada) occupies 5 of these mansions which can, almost, be described as \u201cterraced\u201d in the old British industrial town sense of the word. Many of these \u201cpalaus\u201d are now museums, libraries and art galleries. One notable example of which I am especially enamoured in the Palau Savassona which now houses the Ateneu Barcelon\u00e8s (The Barcelona Art & Cultural Association) which dates from 1860. Their private library is nothing short of spectacular, and the garden bar is a calm wooded oasis just 100 metres from the hurly-burly of The Rambles. Unfortunately, most of the building is not open to the public and you will need to find a local cicerone who is a member of the Association to visit.Very close to the Generalitat and City Hall, you will find the Pla\u00e7a del Rei (King's Square) which houses the Palau Reial Major. It is said that the Kings of Castille received Christopher Columbus on the steps of this Palace on his return from his first voyage to the Americas. There are myriad other marvels to be discovered by walking the area with your eyes well open and ready to explore hidden corners.Perhaps my favourite square in Barcelona, Sant Felip Neri, is to be found here. During the day it is the playground of a local school, but after 5 pm it is a very pleasant place to have a coffee or whatever other poison may take your fancy at the terrace attached to the Hotel Neri, a \u201cboutique\u201d hotel which will delight even the most jaded of tastes. By the way, the rooftop terrace-bar/restaurant of the hotel is well worth a visit too.During the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939) the square of Sant Felip Neri was bombed by the Francoist air force at a time calculated to catch he biggest number of children possible in the \u201cpatio\u201d. The walls of the church and school are still deeply pock-marked from the shrapnel.I first visited the quarter in the late Sixties and was, at the least, a weekly visitor up until the mid Seventies. For many reasons, although living a short metro-ride away, it was not until the early XXI century that I have rediscovered the pleasures and drawbacks of the area.When I first ventured into the area, \u201cventure\u201d being a very apt verb in this case, it was very different place from that which you will find today. Better? In many aspects, it probably is, but, for me, it has lost a lot of its attraction. I was going to say charm, but that is something I have certainly never known in connection with the Barri G\u00f2tic.At that time, the neighbourhood was, broadly speaking, inhabited by two classes: on the one hand were the owners of small shops and the shop-assistants. Owners of bars and restaurants and the waiting and cooking staff, small craft workshops and the occasional micro-industry. Then there were the creatures of the night, myself included.The whole area, with very few exceptions, was dark and dingy, dirty and (detectably) dangerous. The streets were dispiriting, permanently shadowy, even at midday in July. This is what appealed to a twenty-year old clean-cut kid. The fauna that made up this twilight world were drabs, doxies and demi-mondes far past their best, gays, drag-queens and lesbians who found refuge here from a generally intolerant world outside and a penal system that could make their lives very unpleasant. You have to remember that the decadent, disreputable, disgusting, diabolical and detestable dictator, Franco, was still fully in the driving seat and dispensing death penalties right left and centre.Densely dotted with myriad dank dives dispensing drinks and their daily-bread to debauchees, dilettantes, drunks and other diverse depraved devils. Restaurants that were cheap, even by the standards of the Seventies in Barcelona. Casa Jos\u00e9, right beside the church of Santa Maria del Pi, served two daily \u201ccubiertos\u201d (set meals) for 12 and 14 pessetes respectively (\u20ac 0'072 and \u20ac 0'084). The latter included a small salad or fresh orange juice before the two plates, dessert and wine; coffee was extra.As you can well imagine, this was paradise.Then the eighties crept upon us. The new, democratically-elected mayors and city councils needed to be seen to be \u201cdoing things\u201d. A previous \u201cpimping\u201d operation for the 1929 Great Universal Exhibition was, by this time, totally overwhelmed.The main thrust of the reforms was to \u201copen things up to the light\u201d. This meant the demolition of a large number of buildings to form squares and mini-parks. And, thus, stones which hadn't see a ray of sunshine for 300 or 400 years suddenly found out what had been attracting so many tourists to Catalonia since the sixties: the sun!The quarter started its \u201cgentrification\u201d much to the chagrin of people like myself who enjoyed the decadence of yore. All of a sudden the area was dotted with mini-workshops hand-making soaps and perfumes. Second-hand clothes stores specialising in twenties outfits complete with feather boas. Hand-carved thingamabobs rivalled baubles and hippy necklaces for the passing tourists' Dollar, Pound, Mark or Franc.The dominant language changed from being Catalan during the day and Castilian at night to the Spanish of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, etc. In their turn, these started mixing with the languages of North Africa, Pakistan and India. Restaurants began catering for the visitor. Our \"magdalenes\" have become cupcakes (though they are exactly the same) and granny's cooking has been replaced by kebabs. One is regularly assaulted in the street by hawkers extolling the virtues of their particular restaurant without speaking a word of the language of the country. Something which pisses me off in the extreme, but them I'm just a cantankerous old sod nostalgic for the \u201cgood old days\u201d.As an occasional visitor, you will, no doubt, wonder what I am complaining about. It is, after all, a vibrant place full of fun, small boutique bars and restaurants and places to queue up at: The Picasso museum, for example.All in all, I would thoroughly recommend a visit by taking a long slow walk around accompanied by a guide, if possible, a local or, if push comes to shove, just a good guide book."

Every time you turn a corner the street laid out ahead runs for what seems miles. An absolute must when visiting Barcelona. This was the highlight of my weekend.

If you enjoy shopping for something a bit different to the norm, this is where you'll probably find it. Make this area a must on you places to visit in Barcelona."

It is easy to spend a day roaming this part of Barcelona. In the evening, I would feel much less safe, as the streets are dark and there are sections that would make you a target for pickpockets."

We thoroughly enjoyed wandering through these ancient streets with no particular agenda but to see what we would find. Since Peter is an architect, we easily identified the various periods, from the Roman walls to the Medieval buildings, but a friend found the organized tour (that she thought would be cheesy) to be very informative and enjoyable. While some of the streets are clogged with tourists, others are almost empty or used primarily by locals, making it easy to avoid crowds if you wish. I highly recommend trekking through the Gothic Quarter just for its beauty, history or surprises, to shop (not my thing) or dine, to stay (we waited until the last minute to book otherwise we would have stayed in this area) or simply to get from one place to another."

Apart from the inconvenience of the crowds, afternoon and evening, it meant that most of the shops and restaurants were geared to providing for this trade Consequently, you do not see the sort of place that the locals favour. Also you are always paying tourist prices, and at eating tourist quality food. There was no shortage of restaurants, but we found none that delivered a knock out meal you would want to return to.

There is no charge to enter the Cathedral and its sheer size and beauty closely rivals the Sagrada Familia."

A friend recommended El Jardi Hotel in the Barri Gotic and this neighborhood is perfect for exploring Barcelona! First of all, there are many little streets where you can enjoy strolling up and down at a leisurely pace, stopping at many interesting shops along the way.Secondly, outdoor cafes and restaurants are everywhere and let you have a nice little snack on tapas in between your shopping.This neighborhood provides easy access to La Rambla and thusly to La Boqueria, both highlights for many visitors. I personally found the Rambla to be highly overrated but the Boqueria was lively, colorful, fun, and delicious!Metro stations are easy to find in the Barri Gotic. Our hotel was a 3 minute walk to the Liceu metro station and allowed us to visit the other Barcelona highlights, such as Casa Mila, Casa Batllo, and La Sagrada Familia, easily and inexpensively. The T-10 metro ticket gives you 10 rides for 10 euros.I would definitely stay in the Barri Gotic again. Not only was it picturesque, it was easy walking distance to all the places we wanted to see."

It'll be kind of difficult to follow a map in these tight streets, but, if you don't carry one, don't bother, let yourself be at the mood of your own walk. The Gothic Quartier is not so big after all, and sure you won't get lost forever! There are lots of tourists too, unless you walk early in the morning. The architecture is beautiful in this place. Pay attention, the shops aren't open before 10am and almost all of them are closed from 2pm to 4pm or 4.30pm. At night, most of the shops are closed between 8pm and 8.30pm, just a few may close a bit later. But, of course, restaurants are open at night. If you don't want to walk in a \"ghost town\", try to be there when shops are open. Have a coffee/cappuccino and a homemade cake at Caelum, they have conventual recipes!!! It's in Carrer de la Palla, 8 and they have also packaged pastry to take away. If you're looking for trendy shops, look for these streets: Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 and Carrer dels Banys Nous. The most cosy place in Gothic Quartier, for me, is this square: Pla\u00e7a de Sant Felip Neri. It's not so easy to find, but ask someone, you won't regret. You'll see the vestiges of the Civil War in the exterior walls of the church. This amazing little square served also as a setting for videoclips and movies."

This is the area that was originally called Baroni by the Roman's. One can stand on and touch Roman history that is still a part of Barcelona's day-to-day life. At my wife's suggestion, we decided to walk the area at night and I'm glad we did. Using one of Rick Steve's excellent guidebooks, my wife narrated our self-guided tour. The evening hours added a dimension to the walk that one would not get during the day. Besides, the narrow streets were easy to stroll down after dark. We walked through the area on our way to another part of the city during one morning and could barely move at times.There are small restaurants and food vendors throughout the quarter, as well as shopping (but many stores were closed at the time we were there...but then again, that wasn't our reason for strolling the Barri Gotic). This is walk to be savored. Soak up the history and take in the atmosphere. We stopped periodically to listen to street musicians and even came across a concert in an old church courtyard about 10pm...taking time to sit on the church steps and listen to the music with the locals. We never felt that our safety was an issue. Then again, we're from a big city. While walking the Barri Gotic be sure to see: Cathedral of Barcelona, Martyrs Statute, Church of Sant Felip Neri (in a small courtyard that's used as a playground for school kids during the day) where Gaudi worshipped and which is still pockmarked by shrapnel from the revolution, El Call (Jewish Quarter) & the entrance to Barcelona's oldest synagogue dating to the Middle Ages (marked by a very small door on Carrer de Marlet), the Roman Temple of Augustus...where you can stand on a millstone outside the door at #10 Carrer del Paradis)."

Took a taxi and asked him to drop us off at the Church. Beautiful old Church with many Statues of various Saints, each with candles that you could light to honour them. We had wanted to go to mass, and had checked the times, but we somehow missed it. Once outside, we saw where there was a memorial for the many who had been killed in on of the Spanish wars. We then wandered some of the narrow streets and old buildings looking for the Museu d'Historia de la Ciutat. Anne, Karren and Damien wanted to go through it, but I have never liked going down into creepy basements with Roman ruins and hidden passages, and narrow shafts, etc. Karren told me to just go around to the right and she would find me after they finished touring the place. The building had been the Royal Palace built in 1370. he told me they had seen parts of the heating systems, mosaic floors, parts of the surrounding walls, water and drainage systems, and from the cellars you could enter a narrow shaft set vertically in the town wall, where you could view old Roman hidden passages that had been blocked up in the middle ages. They saw many other things of interest and it is said that Christopher Columbus was received by His Royal Majesties on his return from his first voyage to America. However, I found the courtyard where they had probably come out on the balcony to welcome him back, and sat at a table with an umbrella and had a beer. After about an hour, I heard Damien cry out 'Nan! we thought you might have got lost.' We then wandered around and found the Gothic Cathedral, another beautiful Church. They had a fenced in area that had a pond, and there were geese, at least 20. Each time the bells rang, the geese would start to gabble (if that's what geese do). Wandering a little more in the Gothic area, we asked someone how to get to la Ramblas, and we were almost there. We stopped for some wonderful coffee and Damien had a hot chocolate (made with real chocolate) and said he would never be able to drink the kind at home again. We walked up the Ramblas and found the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, where Anne left us as she had to get back to the hotel to receive her temp Credit Card. Damien loved the Hard Rock, and we ate so much we just went back to the hotel also, as soon as we finished our supper."

The shops are small and some are very touristy but there are others that do have some amazing pieces that really reflect the Barcelona vibe.

In addition, we discovered a great wine shop and cheese store that had some of the best jamon and cheese selections.

The best part about the Gothic Quarter was just wondering around and 'getting lost', there's so much interesting architecture around the area, including Placa Real and Barcelona Cathedral and there's no limit to restaurants and bars. There's an astounding amount small speciality shops on some of the side streets including perfumeries, speciality tea shops and hand crafted shops. A must do of any visit to Barcelona."

There is something different and interesting to see around every corner. But my suggestion would be to take or follow a walking tour in the area to get some sense of the historical context: the walls, the Roman aqueducts, the Jewish quarter, etc. We followed a path from a Rick Steeve's tour book which helped to explain what you are seeing. I recommend it. Either way, it is a beautiful place to spend an afternoon."

One stone with hebrew writing can transform an event back to life and we had many experiences such as that. We toured the small ancient synagogue which was amazing. Nice Judaica for purchase. We did tour the Gothic Cathedral of Barcelona which was amazing. The small narrow streets of the walled city was fascinating and there are many beautiful shops to explore.

My wife and I stayed in the Gothic Quarter last week and wanted to make the most of our short two days there by taking a guided tour. After our great experience at the Dali museum in Figueres with guiding.es we decided to use them for our tour of the Gothic Quarter as well. We were incredibly satisfied with our decision.To start with the tour consisted of the two of us and our guide, a 12 year resident of Barcelona who came to Spain from Bulgaria to study tourism. It was apparent that she was in love with the city and had dedicated herself to learning all there was to know about the city, the culture and history of Barcelona. Half of the tour took us to areas of the Gothic Quarter that the other massive group tours saw (places where we ran into groups of 25 or more -- groups so large that headsets were required to hear the guide). The other half of the tour was far more personal sharing century old specialty shops, taking us places to show us answers to questions we asked and showing us historic restaurants and businesses. The gothic quarter feels large but it isn't. It seems like it should be a place that can be self-explored. However, after doing that on our first day in Barcelona and then taking the guiding.es tour on the second day we realized exactly how dense the history of the small ancient city is. Only with a guide as passionate and knowledgable as ours were we able to truly understand the history of such an important part of Catalan history. I highly recommend the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona. I also feel that if you are going to visit it and want to truly understand the place you have to use guiding.es for your tour. They are excellent at what they do and we feel incredibly fortunate to have been able to spend a few hours with our guide."

Barri Gotic was the centre of medieval Barcelona, a labyrinth of old streets interspersed with small squares, pavement cafes, shops and gothic churches. 14th Century Basilica Santa Maria Del Pi with its shrines, cloister and medieval stained glass is particularly worth a visit. Make sure that you allocate enough time to wander, explore, relax, listen to the buskers (some of them are really excellent musicians) and take in the atmosphere. Two practical points: a street map may help you find your way around \u2013 it is a bit of a maze; and as in many city centres popular with tourists (Paris, Rome, London, etc) take extra care to keep your bags, cameras etc safe.

For some, it might feel unsafe (although I never felt so). I love the Barri Gotic and everything about it. The small winding passagways, the suprising twists and turns. The little stores. The little garden squares. Just like Venice, everytime you start to think you know the place, you make a turn and find out that you're lost. To me, no trip to Barcelona would be complete without several hours of aimlessly wandering the Barri Gotic."

Barcelona is complex...surprisingly big....so I used a personal guide from Vayable.com which employs college aged people and other locals to walk with you and tell you their experiences. This worked great here and in Paris...not that expensive as each guide has their own advertisement and they do not get paid until after you are happy....about $15 to $20 per hour is what we spent...and got that back by finding the best happy hour and meal deals I am sure.There are scary stories of this section that will curl your hair....from saints to houses empty for centuries....the deep history of Barcelona lies nearby...we saw very small places where Picasso studied and a courtyard of a school where bullet holes remain in the surrounding walls...I can only say that my wife a history buff learned new facts...so walk these streets and eat lunch in this area and you really feel connected to the past."

A coffee + croissant is 2 euro at the many cafes set in stone courtyards. For the super budget traveler (like myself) make a cuppa at you accommodation to take with you, buy a croissant at a local bakers for 0.50 euro, and you'll be grinning from ear to ear as you listen to Barcelona come to life as it has for hundreds of years.

One night, after an excellent dinner in a small restaurant recommended by my hotel, the location of which they drew on a map, I got lost trying to retrace my steps to a hotel. Wandering far afield (or so I thought) through dark, deserted streets, I remained calm and collected for the city seems very safe.

Based on my experience I'd recommend a slightly structured approach to exploration. Depending on how much time you have, on a tourist map, divide the are into cells and explore one or more cells in a session, punctuated by frequent drinks and snacks in the bars you'll discover.

The stories and events that happened here are fascinating. Beyond any guide book. My husband and I found a great group here on Trip Advisor. It started and finished at Travel Bar. It was free, but you are highly encouraged to pay in the form of a tip. I am not complaining, just informing, It was worth every penny. The guide was a college professor, and a great storyteller. In the Barri Gotic you will find museums, cathedrals, Roman ruins, shopping, bars, and restaurants. If you can stay anywhere n Barcelona, stay here. Hotels are reasonably priced. It's the heart and soul of Barcelona. I wish I could live here. How long until I retire?"

I think it has a lot of magic in it. You can go just for the afternoon to grab an ice-cream or at night and find great restaurants and cool bars. The only reason my review is not excellent, is for the amount of people, bikes and rolling skater that make the place really crowded sometimes. But I think the charm of the place its hard to beat."

The buildings are stunning and you can see where Isabella seduced Christopher Columbus, where the Saints were buried in the cathedral and enjoy people watching in the various courtyard caf\u00e9s and bars.

You cant help but find parts of this area fascinating. It feels a bit like a warren of small, narrow lanes that occasionally open up on to a larger square or gathering place.Each lane has a variety of interesting, quirky small shops. Some of which are a bit touristy, but others are much more attractive and feel more authentic. Some of the larger historic buildings you can go in to for free, including their inner courtyard areas. Others you have to pay to enter, but you may find worthwhile if its your thing e.g. art museums, etc.One small square near the beautiful old church had puppet shows in the middle with puppets playing the pipe and dancing. This was great and free, but people were throwing coins in to a hat. In another much larger central market square type of area in front of the church, there were lots of activities going on. Art displays, folk dancing, including some unexplained ritual of old folk dancing around their \"handbags and hats\". Each to their own!! But it was all fun and entertaining and free.There are lots of cafes in and around these squares and market areas, but we found them to be touristy, expensive and staff not to attentive. A short walk away from these communal open areas we found better, more cosy and cheaper small cafes in the small lanes.It was worth the time and some of the more memorable architecture and scenery that we experienced in Barcelona."

Perhaps it was worse than usual because the shops were mainly shut for 2 of the days we were staying, and the majority of the graffiti was on the steel shop roller blinds. Also the hotel we were staying in was in amongst the back streets so we had to walk past it all the time. It is also a shame that there is so much bag/phone/wallet snatching going on."

The older Cathedral is here, but you had to buy tickets to get in, plus there was a dress code so we couldn't get in anyway. There was a couple of old women beggars with hands outstretched on the steps too. Surprised to find the Picasso museum hidden away down a side street here with a huge queue.

As a solo traveler, I was uncertain if I would feel safe here. The area was always crowded with people and I felt perfectly safe.

On one level, the Barcelona Gothic Quarter is what you might expect - lovely, windy narrow streets, medieval stone work, layers of history in the building themselves. On the other hand, it was not quite as enjoyable as other medieval cities I have been in. It was more trendy in spots, and more graffitied in spots than I would like. Still, if you can find them, there are great bits, like a wonderful fiddle/marrionette show I stumbled into in a small courtyard, and very off-the-beaten-path attractions like the oldest synagoge in Spain. Worth a wander, but nothing that was really spectacular, either."

If you want a historic quarter that has everything, then the Barri Gotic may very well be the most eclectic, entertaining, and well positioned in all of Europe. Squares and ambling streets are reminiscent of Rome and Venice. Ancient Cathedrals, the Picasso Museum, and tapas bars share side streets in a harmonically chaotic existence. Locals and tourists mix in a vibrant melange of bustle that is interrupted daily and nightly by parades, fireworks, impromptu street shows, concerts, and stage acting. The food scene in the Barri Gotic is eclectic, exquisite and hugely affordable (think tapas heaven).But if anything, it's perhaps the location of the Barri Gotic that sets is apart. Rome has Trastavere, Paris has Montmarte, but there's no beach, major shopping area, port, world class park, and zoo within a 10 minute wall. The Barri Gotic has all of them. Barcelona's city beaches, constructed after the '92 Olympics, rival anything Southern California has to offer, with chic restaurants, wide sandy beaches, and runners/bikers/rollerbladers/palm trees galore. Plaza Espanya and Las Ramblas are minutes in one directions and Park Cituadella and the Zoo minutes in the other, and the port runs just south of the Barri Gotic with countless options for seafood and Paella.The Barri Gotic is lively, loud, historic, local, touristy, and hip all at the same time. It's everything you could want a major world city to provide!"

For the younger crowd it's to partake in the party scene while also having access to beaches. For most other people, the Gothic Quarter represents the draw of Barcelona. The unique architecture of the quarter is well representative of how distinctive the city is to see, while also having some fabulous restaurants and cafes, and shopping boutiques to spend your money. You would almost have to put effort forth to find bad food here, and you don't feel as though you are paying an premium simply because of the location (Las Ramblas, on the other hand, seems to understand it can get away with over charging). Most people would probably get more of an an appreciation of the quarter if they were to visit it as part of a walking tour, which my girlfriend and I didn't do and I slightly regret. My girlfriend and I along with another couple had a great dinner at Bilbao Berria (http://bilbaoberria.es/) and then strolled the quarter and grabbed wine at various locations nearby as part of a \"quiet\" evening that ended at four in the morning or so. You can easily plan either a date night or group gathering in the quarter without worrying about it being a party scene. It's probably a better place to end a day than make a lunch destination."

My husband and I are on our second visit to Barcelona - in 2012, we stayed in the el Born neighborhood, but this time, we rented a VRBO in Barri Gotic, the oldest part of the city. Our building is many centuries old, and I'd always wanted to \"see what was behind those doors.\"The Barri Gotic has buildings nearly 2 millenia old, and it is easy to imagine these apartments when there was no running water. The buildings are so close together, you could jump from balcony to balcony (without being Spiderman!) and since these aren't air conditioned, everyone's windows and doors are wide open all the time. As a result, when you stay here, you get to hear the murmur of conversations in hundreds of households; children laughing and play in the street, and (when there is a festival), firecrackers all around. As I look up from my computer at this instant, I can see hundreds of balconies draped with laundry from as many families, and I can smell the aromas of cooking meals and the laughter of families together. Oh, let me mention the graffiti: Graffiti in Barcelona is an art form, not only tolerated but encouraged. It is never painted over. If you have the idea that graffiti means a part of town is somehow unsafe, etc., you don't know Barcelona. Certainly it is nothing to be concerned about and if you pay attention you will see that much of the graffiti is very well done, and preserved with pride (some shops commission graffiti for their rolled-down shop doors; when the shops are open, you don't get to see this art form much). All my experiences in Barcelona, including Barri Gotic, have demonstrated it is safe; keep your purse closely at hand and your wallet deep in your pocket, because some pickpockets might take advantage of your attention being elsewhere. But harsh crime is almost unheard of.In the USA, we live in single family homes with lawns to tend to; rarely do we hear neighbors. (This is where we get it wrong.) Here, the city is dense with people going abut their lives, doing business, having families.... and it feels like the heartbeat of Gaia.Spend a day getting lost in the Barri Gotic and you will stumble across charming shops the size of a closet, tapas bars not much larger than a living room, and so much more.Fabulous! This week, I am privileged to call it home."

There are so many restaurants in the squares just off La Rambla. The food is excellent and the prices are reasonable. Even the buskers that entertained us were talented. Just be aware that if you chose to eat at one of the restaurants on the main thoroughfare you will pay considerably more for everything. If in doubt, ask to see the menu before you are seated.

Wandering around is great fun and a fantastic way to discover restaurants and wine bars. Wile there are a number of groups of young guys selling drugs (note the red beer cans!), they seem harmless enough as it is a busy area with many tourists. The charm of the narrow streets and countless small bars and restaurants is definitely worth a visit. We stumbled on one bar with great live music (jazz) and and an incredible arabic / tapas restaurant neither of which we will forget!"

I had been hearing for years about the fabled Barri Gotik of Barcelona as being a most fantastic area to visit. Oh of course it's lovely to walk in all those streets (and it must be nice to be in the shade in the summer), but at the end of the day, except for a few historic buildings (mostly churches, most with an entrance fee), it's rather disappointing as far as history goes.Don't expect much. The cathedral is fantastic (and free in the mornings, but mobbed), the old roman aquaduct and gate is impressive and there's some nice churches... Oh and if you can find it, there's also the ruins of a Roman temple inside a modern atrium... But other than that, at the end of the day, the fabled Barri Gotik is just a labyrinth of streets full of restaurants, cafes, souvenir shops and Desigual shops.Pla\u00e7a Reial is a nice square, but I would avoid eating there and the Rambla, near it, only holds interest for the many pickpockets who are waiting for the unsuspecting tourists.Don't get me wrong, it's a very nice area to stroll if you're visiting Barcelona, and it certainly qualifies as something to see.It's just not what they're trying to sell you in tourist guides."

We were lucky enough to do a free (donation accepted at end of tour) walking tour of Barcelona's gothic quarter early on our first day in Barcelona which was a fantastic introduction to the city. Getting a first hand look at the medieval city as well as remnants of the ancient Roman city was truly fascinating. It's a 1.5 hr walk so put on some comfortable shoes and be ready for a fascinating historical perspective on Barcelona. Most central hotels close to placa Catalu\u00f1a will have information on walking tours around the gothic quarter. Don't miss a visit to La Boqueria market and look for the artisan shops and caf\u00e9s that have plaques installed on the pavement in front of the front door. This is recognition by the city of Barcelona that the store has been carrying out the same use for a very long time, in some cases over 100 years"

Life pulsates in this picturesque because young occupants have moved within its venerable walls.

The little, cobbled stoned alleys lined by beautiful old buildings, decorated with brightly painted windows and doors, and sometimes elaborate patterns on the exterior facades; ornate balconies gushing with the fresh bloom of spring flowers; narrow passageways that surprisingly open into charming little squares populated with tiny outdoor bars & cafes and terraces\u2026the Gothic Quarter is literally a world of its own. It is true what they say about Barcelona - the sunlight makes everything look so much happier and alive\u2026. all the oranges, yellows, corals, pinks and turquoises blend harmoniously to create a multi-coloured visual treat that is every photographer's paradise! Don't miss the little chapels and churches that dot this area. if you can manage a walking tour guide, it's recommended so that you can learn about the history of this place. In the night, the Gothic Quarter takes on an eery, mysterious aura - nothing to be afraid of as such. If you're lucky, you might even have a Spanish Guitar encounter! If you're on your own, I would say ditch the map you're carrying around, and just wander around. There is much to see, do, shop, eat and drink along the way - or sometimes, to just sit and watch the world pass by."

After visit a lot of old city centers in Europe (Florence, Nice, Stavanger, Bergen, Rome, etc.) I can definitely say that I didn't get what the hype was about this Barri Gotic neighborhood. We did the Gotic walk that's described in most tourist guides and even if we saw three or four interesting landmarks, 75% of the walk took place in shabby alleys smelling of urine and flanked by boarded up shop fronts and graffiti. There is indeed a few beautiful little squares in the mix, but that's not really worth the entire visit, especially when half these squares are overrun by shady looking homeless people."

One hit her in back, then the other grabbed her bag and ran off in crowd. Another lady we met was almost robbed coming out of phamacia. Evidently thieves looking for meds to steal.

I chose to stay in this area because I love history and old buildings.However, don't think of 'York', which is a wonderfully preserved and quaint town- this is dirty and cramped.The streets are so, so narrow that they act like echo chambers and it is very noisy. Despite the streets being narrow, cars run up and down them, meaning your diving into doorways to avoid being hit.The tall buildings on these streets are shops at ground floor, with mostly apartments above.The rubbish generated in these buildings is simply put outside the door at ground level, i.e. on the street. So, during the day the rubbish builds as well as the dog dirt from the myriad of people walking their pets.While there are trucks that clean this rubbish up every morning, the fact is, that as each day drags on, so the rubbish builds.There are simply tonnes and tonnes of restaurants however, most of them sell paella and/or tapas, which is a bit tiresome. It would be like visiting England and only being able to eat fish and chips in every restaurant!However, while this place clearly hasn't gone down very well with me, I can see it is a place full of amazing history with a lot to offer tourists. The cathedral was really lovely (however, go dressed appropriately or they won't let you in because, though God created us naked, He gets offended by bare shoulders)."

Just before leaving our hotel, we read in one person's tripadvisor account about the pickpocket ploy of having someone spray paint the back of your jacket, then another \"helpful\" person calling the event to your attention. As we walked into a beautiful little square a man asked \"Do you speak English?\" and then said \"Look at your jacket.\" We looked about and realized there were at least a couple of other men watching closely, perhaps ready to close in on us, so we hurried away and then waited in a pharmacy until they moved on. Thankfully, the spray paint or whatever it was came off of my wife's favorite sweater with cold water. This happened on our last day in Barcelona and could have put a sour note on our impression of this beautiful city, but we had 2 p.m. reservations to visit Sagrada Familia and that place is so incredible that we went away with glowing opinions of Barcelona. But if a stranger comes up to you saying \"Do you speak English?\" or \"Look at your jacket,\" it's best not to respond and to leave quickly. We consider ourselves pretty streetwise and were being vigilant and still could have fallen for this if we hadn't read the warnings that morning.We never felt unsafe while in Barcelona, but pickpockets are always a concern in places where there are lots of tourists."

The passageways were very narrow at some point but it was fun navigating thru there. You can get a little lost but it was fun exploring the little passage ways. I wouldn't wonder on my own especially at night. Great place to do some shopping, take pictures, and sight seeing."

The narrow ,winding streets open up into placas or squares creating an interesting labyrinth full of pieces of architecture! While we were walking through a narrow street we started to anticipate a piece of art at every corner and you bet we were not disappointed at all.I would advise you to look up and around or you may miss some nice bits!Right in the heart of the quarter is a huge Cathedral which is equally superb form the inside. Placa Reial is good to relax and to be spoilt for eating choices from Tapas to Paellas. Placa St. Jaum is famous for its government buildings which are open for public on Sunday mornings. There are some good shops too which are an exception from the regular souvenir shops. Beware of the pick pockets and try not to roam about late at night though.To get to Barri Gotic or gothic quarter there are three metro stops on La Rambla , Liceu is one of the stations and Jaum 1 is on the side of Via Latinae.A perfect place for an afternoon stroll!"

After a quick breakfast on La Rambla, head down towards the harbor and dive into the Middle Ages. Stop at the Cathedral and take in the exterior and the performers in the square. Make sure you visit the Museum of the History of the City. You can walk into and over excavated Roman ruins to really get a feel for the foundation of Barcelona. There are plenty of little streets and alleys to explore within the old Jewish Section. Signage is good, and we found the shop owners to be very helpful and friendly.

If you turn off La Rambla anywhere, and walk in a block or so, you can save a considerable amount of money on food and drinks. There's everything from Falafels to Paella, popsicles, liquor stores and all kinds of shopping. The architecture is amazing, and there was so much to see. We loved the inner courtyards all over, where we could stop for a glass of wine and feel like we'd stepped back in time. There were several very affordable liquor stores / grocery stores where we grabbed snacks and wine to take back to the hotel with us. This area was my favorite in Barcelona."

We even had our own violinist under our window. I'm wondering after our last visit if they were having a festival at the time. On this recent visit, there were huge crowds everywhere. The little shops had been replaced by international chains. And not a single street performance. The worst is that I attempted to find the old apartment area on a Friday evening. I finally found the right street, and it was roped off for an auto rally. This further condensed the crowds, plus the noisy smelly cars running the home stretch. The most worst is that at the end, in front of the cathedral, they had a huge loud speaker announcing the results in stentorian tones. Fortunately, this ended after 5 minutes, and my friends had kept me from running away. I found the apartment. My true goal was to find the lovely wine bar across the street in the basement of a 14th century convent. I found it. It's a ticky-tacky clothing and junk store. Disappointment!!!There are many good things about Barcelona (concerts, museums), but it's dropped off my list of favorite places."

The further north / west you go, the better it gets. Though it presents like a maze, kind of like Venice, it is manageable. Go to the old Cathedral (600 years to build). Cross Laitanea (sp?) and then walk towards the water in El Born. Nice boutiques and restaurants and watering holes. A family could spend days in the Gothic Quarter. South of La Rambla, while it has cleaned up in recent years, is still sketchy, street walkers, etc., not family oriented. Ladies, watch your purses in the Gothic Quarter, men watch your wallets. Safe but notorious for pickpockets. Don't ever consider using an ATM in this area which is not within a bank, i.e.., no ATMs which face the sidewalks."

We rented an apartment (we brought our Chihuahua with us) in this old section of Barcelona and find it all an amazingly delightful experience. Everyone in Barcelona has been so friendly that even tho it is a big city, I feel like I am in a small village. The apt. is two levels and some of the interior stone walls brought to make this part of the building date to the Middle Ages! (It was renovated 10 years ago by the owner, a fairly young woman who is an architect.) It is on one of the very windy narrow teensy little streets a car can hardly fit down and right across from a sweet little restaurant whose manager has been a wonderful help. When my sister-in-law came to visit and broke her ankle, the manager carried her in his arms all the way down the street to our apartment when he saw us getting out of a large cab that wouldn't fit down at the end of the street. My husband and I bought each other rings hand-crafted by two jewelsmiths who had just opened a tiny shoppe kitty-corner across from our apartment. They had to be resized and when we went back to get them, Roberto invited us to the \"neighborhood Christmas Dinner\" \"because you are our neighbors now\"! I couldn't believe it. There were about a dozen others who were all artists...one world-famous artist who later invited us to his studio 3 doors down, several jewelsmiths, a woman journalist who covers the art scene here, two women art school students who work in the jewelers' studio and thrown in, the guy who runs the Segway Tours biz around the corner. We had such a grand time and I was in heaven as Friday here is \"duck day\" and I got another leg of duck! The Barri Gotic is the best place to stay if you don't mind the occasional street sound (someone singing at 2am when the bars close, people gleefully laughing occasionally). We walk to everything including our favorite Caf\u00e9 de l'Opera on La Rambla where we have our nightly espresso and Napoleon (milles-feuilles in France, mille-ojas in Spanish), an exquisite phyllo-layered pastry filled with a divine custard between all the layers. I was in Barcelona 52 years ago (hitchhiking down from Grenoble, France where I studied) and all I did was slurp down cheap brandy and play chess with one of Spain's most famous retired bullfighters! This time, I am getting to know the real Barcelona! What a joy!"

Although the lanes are tiny and very easy to get lost in, you can walk around and find something beautiful, i specially loved the murals and paintings on buildings!"

Be prepared for whatever the weather may bring so please check the forecast prior. Time: typically starts at 9 AM, you can buy tickets at any local tourist office or even your hotel lobby. Loved our tour guide during both tours, extremely knowledgeable people with a great attitude. Highly recommend and feel this is a must have since Barcelona has so much history to share.

Usually some of the tourists miss this part due to the outer lanes but if you go to the Gothic Cathederal then this part of the city and its magic draws you in. The cathedral is in a big open space and then like a octupus arms a lot of small lanes join into this open space. Take any one and start walking. Each street is unique, shops are exquisite, from clothes , souvenirs, eateries, herbal stuff or fresh fruits everything is there. Each of these streets joins a big open space which could have anything from a police station in a historic building, church or even theater. The alleys are just so filled with history that you can feel the ghosts of old travellers moving with you. Buildings and architecture is enough on its own. If a group of friends is going there with you then more the fun. Also we had the pleasure of seeing a dance performance and a individual musician on a flute, you may get lucky and see something even better. Every city retains its core heart over the ages which gives out its true flavor, this would be for me the Integral part of Barcelona.Unfortunately this happened on last day of our visit from 3.00 pm onwards, Could have easily spent another whole evening discovering this one ......................... look forward to another oppurtunity"

This area of Barcelona is unique and you feel like you are going back in history as you explore the many alleys, odd/hidden streets, and interesting buildings. If you are in Barcelona, you have to visit this area. Check out Rick Steve's Barcelona book as it will help you find many of the hard-to-find gems in this community."

Wandering rather than a planned route leads to surprise encounters. Despite all the warnings about pick pockets etc, it felt quite safe. Lots of beggars. The cathedral was astounding, we went back for a mass. Market outside in the square was interesting. Great cafe on corner. Busy with queues for toilets. Completely confused as what is street versus footpath as the streets are so narrow. Don't forget to look up when walking. Beautiful decorations on building roofs. Catedral spire acts as great reference point."

We visited this beautiful cathedral, then wended our way through the narrow medieval streets of the Gothic Quarter all the way to Plaza Catalunya. Along the way we came upon surprising little plazas, some large, some small, and all with tables and chairs set up for diners. We ate lunch inside at Taller Tapas, taking a break from the heat and from our sightseeing. The lunch was tasty and reasonably priced, a nice break in our day. We then headed to the Cathedral of Barcelona, the ancient church, and the large plaza outside. While in Barcelona, we were staying in the El Raval section, just across La Rambla from the Gothic Quarter. We enjoyed our first exploration so much that we made two more ventures into this section. One was to go to dinner at Babia, not far from the main cathedral. That was a wonderful nighttime adventure walking the ancient streets trying to find our way. With help from a shopkeeper we found our restaurant, had a great meal and then headed back to our hotel. On the way back we turned a corner to find a wonderful gelato shop. There were many others on the streets as we headed to our hotel around 10:30pm. On our last day we walked through the impressive Plaza Reial and made our way through the streets to the water. I would recommend spending time in this old section of the city because it is unique in Barcelona and a treat to explore. It is filled with plazas, shops, and dining venues, and the people we encountered were genuinely hospitable."

Every time we turned a corner, there was a new architectural wonder- from ancient Gothic buildings to quaint squares and parks, and newer buildings from many eras - their architecure and facades amazed and delighted us. We found streets that were specifically devoted to certain trades - some of them for tourists - but not all. This was the real Barcelona - away from the \"tourista\" version of Barcelona on Las Ramblas. We were away from the crowds, and able to take our time to enjoy the buildings, the people, and the ambiance."

Obviously with the Cathedral and several other highlighted places to see here, the Barri Gotic is a must-see part of any trip to Barcelona.

You'll never stay lost for long, and the warren of tiny streets features one surprise after another. Good places to eat, to shop, to relax, and then of course there is Cathedral Square -- I had the great good luck to come upon it just as the sardana was being danced -- this slow, circular dance (a bit Zorba-the-greek-ish) is something tourists love to see, and for some, to participate in, but it's a dance of, by and for the Catalan people. It has a social aspect as it brings them together, and a political one, as it unites them in deeper ways. Yes, there are more than a fair share of tourist shops, but it remains one of my favorite parts of a great city! Oh, and don't be afraid to get a bit lost...it's the best way to get to know a new city."

It was an excellent introduction to this beautiful area of Barcelona. The tour guide was entertaining and knowledgeable and provided historical, political and social commentary on the buildings in the area and Catalonia generally. The area is remarkable in its diverse architecture and its place in Catalan history. The tour was money well spent and provided a framework for further exploration."

Although we loved what mystery was found behind every corner and narrow alley, we would never have found the Roman Columns without latching on to a tour group and following them. Although in another language, it still got us to hidden places. Most we did manage to find on our own. We did the Taste of Barcelona Tapas tour which also was great for a guided tour, making our way back to some of the same places to eat the next day. Do not miss the stunning Catedral de Barcelona in the center square of the Gothis quarter. It is free and not to be missed. Your shoulders and knees need to be covered but it is amazing inside and the side cathedral houses the 13 geese. The Gotic quarter is alive and easy to reach. This is where to find great food, not on Las Ramblas. There are many museums and sights to behold. We wandered upon a great square at night on the way to the metro station and had no idea what it was but realized a hotel was surrounding the square. We had no problems, but be aware of your belongings at all time."

Last night we were having trouble finding a guidebook restaurant, and the first place we stopped to ask directions we waited while a man ahead of us told the hotel clerk that he'd just been robbed. Then we stopped to ask a shopkeeper directions, and after he told us where to head, he added, \"Don't go in that direction! It's dangerous there!\" Looking around us, he was right. Most areas are fine, but watch where you are. And just because there's a restaurant in a guidebook, it doesn't mean that walking to get there is safe. Also, you can't take a cab into this neighborhood because the streets are pedestrian only. Daytime here seems great, highly recommended."

My friend is vegan and she discovered several places that catered to her needs and was pleased with the options offered. I went on the FREE BArri Gotic tours and enjoyed both of them. I took two tours since I really wanted to see and learn lots. The host of the rental apartment was in charge of one of the tours and he showed us places to eat and the several Gaudi properties. The free tours can be found on line or by asking at the hotel/airbnb hosts, etc. It was great to wander all the little side streets, get lost and get found again, have a delicious pastry....do try their melted chocolate hot chocolate...lots of little cafes offer it and it is amazing!

I have seen large and small cities in France and Italy, and even Madrid in Spain, but still enjoyed very much the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona, couldn't help taking pictures of architectural landmarks, or just quaint shops and crowded plaza. Besides La Rambla and the tourist sites dedicated to Gaudi, Picasso and Joan Miro, the Gothic Quarter is a must see destination if you are in Barcelona the first time. Barcelona couldn't be Barcelona without it. We were there in September when the weather was still absolutely pleasant, having a small meal at a restaurant in open air and soaking in the atmosphere was one of the highlight of the trip. Enjoy!"

I found this place simply amazing and I'm writing this review in my orrible english just to make every tourist know that he/she can't miss the old city (or the Gothic District, as you please).I think it's magical. Maybe it's because it reminds me my own city (Catania, but it's veeery far from this beauty), but all the small streets, with ther \"dangerous\" charm (i guess they're not really confortable during nightime) and peculiar shops; and after a lot of incredibly narrow and intricate streets, you found out a square, more than one to be honest, like Plaza Real (really elegant: remind me of Rome and a waiter told me i'm beautiful...thank you!) or Plaza del Rei, where i wanted to go to the historical museum, but it was closed, so insted i had tapas in the square, where you can meet a very interesting waiter who speaks one million languages and made us pay a very lower price (thank you!).Of course you have to visit the cattedral, and remember to wear somenthing \"covering\" or they won't let you in. The most fascinating thing was about the ducks who \"defend\" the church and make a lot of funny noise.What else? Have very very fun and if you find some mistake please tell me, i'm a languages student and i like travelling and learning.Love everyone"

If you have ever travelled to historic mediteranean ports with castellations and narrow streets full with character then be amazed by an area as large as all those others added together. Unlike the rest of Barcelona, the grid pattern does not exists as naroe alleys criss cross and intersect and many differing angles. the buildings are to tall as to obscure your view of the position of the sun and I found myslf using a compas in order to work our our direction of travel. The many shops, boutiques, cafes, and hidden churches make this a wonderfull place to stroll through at any time of day. At night time most are very well lit but I would always be prepared and caryy a small flashlight."

If you like to look at old buildings and like small streets this is for you. We were there in the evening so I can't comment on daytime activities in the area but in the evening there are restaurants and bars. There is a lot of foot traffic. A good place to walk and if you go there you don't have much choice: the streets aren't designed for cars."

The old centre of Barcelona is one of the most delightful places to visit, for the narrow pedestrian streets, the enormous number of shops, restaurants and bars, super food, outstanding value for money, and the history of the place. The Barri Gotic extends from the Ramblas to the Via Leitana and contains the main Cathedral, but one must also include the Ribera (Born) district to the NE of the Via Leitana, for the Church of Sta Maria del Mar and the Picasso Museum. Either before or after your visit, read the trilogy by Carlos Ruiz Zafon (Spain's most popular author), comprising Shadow of the Wind, The Angel's Game, and Prisoner of Heaven, plus Ildefonso Falcone's Cathedral of the Sea. These stories will bring so much of what you see to life, as they are set in this part of Barcelona. There is not space to do justice to Barcelona as a city to visit, but it is certainly the best city I have ever visited."

It\u2019s newer, cleaner, not as crowded, and offers the same experience, if not better.

I have lots of friends who travel just so they can experience something different from the techno-modern world they live in and I am one of those people too. When I was planning this trip, I was told that the Gothic Quarter was similar to Paris before Hausmann so of course, I had to make my way there.If I had to point to a single 'must see' thing, I probably couldn't do that - it is experiencing the area as a whole that makes it special. Of course, visiting a place as opposed to a single destination requires taking some time, so do take the time to wander down the many cobblestone streets. You will find quiet by-ways, busy squares and lots of locals going about the business of their day. We found a great tapas bar, a beautiful cathedral, some incredible architecture and street performers to enjoy. We were wending our way through one of the passages when the high, clear sound of an opera aria drifted around us; we followed the notes to their source, a woman whose talent would be hard to match even on the most venerable of performing stages. It was simply magical."

Take the time to look up - some of the apartments have lovely plants hanging from the balconies, and the whole area has a very romantic and almost mystic feel."

If you go in the winter months you might still get a whiff of the old days. But nowadays you'd better brace yourself for a bit of North African globalization. Like all urban areas, as the other reviewers remark, there are plenty of places to drink here. If you want more of the Barcelona lifestyle, though, maybe you'd better head for the Eixample area.

It just takes you to an entirely different place and time.In the Summer, it stays light out until 10pm there. If you were there after dark, very late at night, I can see where it might be a little scary getting lost in some of the alleyways. If that is a concern, my suggestion would be to confine your visit to the late afternoon, early evening. It is not far from La Rambla, however, so you are never too far away from the crowds."

Of course, everyone knows you should visit the gothic quarter while in Barcelona, but I have an extra tip for you: Visit the place, walk all around the various streets, from top to bottom--- do this both by day and night. You'll get different feels throughout the day, depending on the crowd at the time, the sun's direction and the goings-on. Also, spend some time stopping by the enclaves or placas you see along the way, they either have offices, shops or restaurants that are quite interesting. These places get exciting towards the evening. The architecture here is magnificent. Take a lot of photos. You'll regret not doing so later. Go into the beautiful buildings, most of it is free. Talk to the locals and just explore."

It left from the beginning of Las Ramblas near the Hard Rock Cafe. The walk turned out to be extremely interesting. Besides the cobblestone streets, cafes, and shops, there is much history here. You wouldn't know about any of it without the tour. We went by some graves from Roman times, and the story behind that was awesome. Holes were left in the tombs so relatives could put food inside! We also saw a courtyard that had been refurbished except for one building which still had damage from the Spanish Civil War. The battered building stands in commemoration of that event. Later we went back to walk some of the area again. The tour took a little over 2 hrs, and we loved it. Definitely recommend."

There are lots of amazing hidden gems that we would never have found alone and more interesting because of the guide's info (which was in very clear English). Note - many of the locations such as Temple d'August can be visited at no cost and are listed in guidebooks however some we would never have known to go and look at such the entrance ways and courtyards of several public-access buildings including the Palau de Lloctinent.

We walked home through the winding alleys and charming streets. We also went for our final night and ate at Sensi (recommended for Asian-fusion tapas!). After Sensi, we decided to check out the bar-hopping scene and wandered through more alleyways - it somewhat got sketchy and the crowd was going crazy (this was closer to Las Ramblas).I was recommended to visit this part of the city with the disclaimer that it was so charming and quaint, but after seeing the crowd on a Friday night (we're only talking about midnight), I would advise going during the day."

The Gothic Cathedral is just beautiful. Go to the ancient Roman temple of Augustus and you'll see 4 Roman columns in this 2000 year old building. People are not really opening their shops and stores until about 9 or 10. Some will also close for siesta from around 1:30 - 4:30. Most shops in the Quarter will close around 8. The restaurants will be open much later and until early hours of the morning. I highly recommend a walking tour and Orange Donut Tours is the one we took.

A sunny day is best for the ramble. The Barri Gotic and Las Ramblas are among the most pickpocket rich areas in the world. To avoid having the miserable experience of being among the victims, take these simple precautions: Do not bring all of your important stuff--passport, credit cards, big money, etc. while you are walking around. What you will need is one credit card, enough money for the day out, and your camera. If you can, leave the rest in the hotel safe in your room. If you don't have an in-room safe, next best option is using an under-the-clothing money belt. Wear it so it doesn't show--some models hang from your belt, some have waist belts (i wear mine against the small of my back, tucked inside my pants). Second, be sensible about not being a target--assume that commotions are a smoke-screen for a team pickpocketing effort. If somebody tries to thrust something into your hands--a petition, some bit of tat for sale, etc, refuse to take it and walk on. Be discrete about using your camera--leaning back for a couple of minutes looking through the viewfinder waiting for the perfect shot is an invitation to pickpockets to bump into you and relieve you of the contents of your pockets. I don't want to discourage you from visiting the Barri Goitic, but only to take reasonable steps to keep from having a cultural experience that in retrospect you would be happy to skip."

Gotic and El Born just next door is full of an eclectic mix of dreadlocks, funky fashion labels and skateboards along with couples walking around with the Time Out guide in a spare hand during the day, easily turning into an area where you barely have to step out of your apartment to find an interesting bar or restaurant that will keep you wined and dined until the early hours. Keep an eye out for the odd innocuous shop front later on as some of the small take away places are well worth it and you can grab amazing Schawarma or falafel wraps.Our apartment was on Carrer De La Merce near the post office and would highly recommend the wait to grab an amazing sandwich for lunch at \u2018Bo de\u2019 which is on the corner of the street. It usually takes 20mins but is well worth it. \u2018Sensi\u2019 on C.Ample was our favourite place to eat during a week\u2019s stay and eating all around the city so I would highly recommend booking for a meal. The staff all speak English so booking from the UK is easily done. To sum up, if you want to experience Barcelona away from the ridiculously busy main attractions and still have access to everything you need, I couldn\u2019t think of a better area. "

When you think \"gothic\", does gloomy weather over stone walled passage ways not come to mind? Also, the rain probably scared off a lot of the crowds, which meant more room for us! So, not only is the architecture worth a visit in it's own right, there are so many different cute/cool little shops, pubs and restaurants hidden inside. I'm a person who prefers to sit inside with hot tea and movies when it rains. But, we walked there twice (from our not so close hotel) in the rain over the course of our poorly weathered, three day weekend visit to Barcelona. I will definitely visit again."

It was a lovely area with narrow streets and tall buildings with pretty balconies. There were lots of great shops that were not expensive at all and the cathedral was there too. We stopped at a nice cafe in a courtyard for some drinks and snacks. We decided to go back on another day as we loved the area there."

There was hardly anyone up there as we wandered around on the scaffolding path. I dont think we would have been able to do that in the UK. The views were exceptional and we took some amazing photos of all the sights we had seen during the two previous days. We were lucky because the sun had burnt off the haze which had been around earlier in the day."

The \"Barrio Gotico\" (Gothic Quarter) is one of the oldest Quarters in Barcelona.It is a quite big area running from plaza Catalunya down to the sea, and from la Rambla to Via Laietana.***LIKESA lot of history of Barcelona is found in this Quarter, with special attention to be drawn on the big Gothic Cathedral, very tipical, FREE to visit and very striking to visit.Also a lot of narrow little streets that intersect one another several times inside the same Quarter, at times making you feel lost but always bringing you to some nice and populated area where some people are most probably having a beer by the street and talking (or SHOUTING) to each other!Last but not least there are a lot of bars where you can have nice tapas, beers, cocktails of very nice quality for a usually relatively cheap price.***DISLIKESSometimes the streets are too much polulated, and for this reason, specially at night, a lot of foreigns tendo to pee and vomit in the streets like if they were not in the street.Although the Barcelona road cleaning service is very efficient, you can easily find yourself in the middle of a horrible smell, and you don't know how long will it still last for.As well this Quarter can be very dangerous when it comes to pickpockets.It is a fantastic place for them to rob people. My advise is not to apporach and embrace or have physical contact with Moroccan or similar race people, as 99% of pickpokets are from those areas.Obviously I am not saying that all of them are, but just be carefull with those you don't really know.As well in this Quarter there is not a proper market like in other Barcelona quarters, as well as the supermarkets are not always very close to your location. There are many Pakishops, a bit more expensive than a normal supermarket but still enough supplied to find what you need.***You can take with you everything that you want and dress as you like, the beautiful thing about this city is that people don't judge you.You can happen to be there in the morning with normal dress, in the afternoon with your swimming suite and in the evening with your nice party dress and it is always very nice to be walking in this very attractive quarter.You can plan to walk there just for an hour or so, otherwise you can spend there the all day just visiting this quarter, its streets, museums, churches and Cathedral.Enjoy it!!"

The Roman remains of Barcino under the modern city were very impressive. The Barcelona Cathedral is beautiful and the Roman temple near modern dwellings just fascinated me. We stayed in this area as it was easy to walk to restaurants, shops and of course the historic area. The Barcelona Marathon came right through on one of our days here."

And the Barcelona Cathedral is not to be missed...simply stunning. I was amused that instead of lighting candles though, they had modernized it with electric candles...there is a slot to drop in your coins and any number of candles light up depending on how much money you deposited!"

The major attractions are the Cathedral, Palau Reial, some old houses and palaces,museums, other churches (e.g. S. Maria del Pi) and squares (some of them require ticets/ are upon fee). A must see when in Barcelona.There are also lots of shops, bars, cake shops, even a demonstration at Placa S. Jaume in front of Palau Generalitat if you are lucky ;-)"

So I guess for the lads \u2013 best time to visit this area is either on a Sunday or Monday! Worth a wander taking in the Cathedral, but don\u2019t make it a priority if you\u2019ve done \u2018back streets\u2019 before and/or you\u2019re short on time.

The cathedral, huge and impressive, is typical of European, medieval cathedrals and is open to the public most times. Nearby are 4th century remains of the Roman city, Barcino, that preceded Barcelona. And if Roman archeology interests you, don't miss the City History Museum which includes extensive Roman ruins that have been excavated beneath the present street level. This museum also includes gothic remains and exhibits on Barcelona in the early Industrial Age, giving a very complete history of this old and interesting city.There is much more to this area of the city that I didn't have time to see--don't miss it!"

It is a maze of winding streets going up and down little hills, with buildings that span centuries towering on either side. There are so many different architectural styles and points of interest to see around every corner that you can entertain yourself for ages just walking around without ever going in anywhere. To be sure, there are plenty of tourist trap-type places, but that shouldn't detract from the overall feel of the place. We thought the Museum of the History of Barcelona (MUHBA) is a must-see, as is the cathedral, and just a general stroll around."

Given that it was Christmas Day we decided to spend some time inside the Cathedral which was a great spiritual experience. We then explored the area strolling along those little streets and alleyways until we reach Arc de Triomf , an access gate to a wide promenade connecting with the Park of the Ciutadella.

The walls enfold you and around every corner is history and incredible little shops with fascinating and interesting products and curios. The real history of Barcelona is in these walls and this area of the city and on a hot, sultry, day it is so cool and inviting. You can see the locals living their lives as they always have done in the tiny squares and narrow streets. The buildings tell you their own story and the atmosphere seems unchanged for hundreds of years. We spent several afternoons wandering around and had the best food and lunchtime tapas on our entire trip inside these walls."

If you're lucky you'll stumble upon some small neighborhood play happening in one of the corners on a small street. They had a Christmas play happening in the middle of a small street that didn't have a lot of tourist traffic....it was in Spanish but not a ton of people watching which gave us the impression that it was more for the locals."

You need at least a whole day to explore the area so we did not see all that it has to offer. I can imagine that some parts of this area are very 'seedy' especially at night. Some cleaning of certain buildings would certainly enhance the areas appearance which overall is charming. However, the City Authorities really need to clean up the graffiti which is a real eyesore and spoils the fa\u00e7ades of many buildings. Well worth a visit though. The restaurants and bars on the Carrer Ferran are numerous and inviting."

The only thing I would say is that the small alleys can actually be quite dangerous at night with junkies and be careful to keep your wallets/purses safe as there are lots of pick-pockets - common problem in many big cities and just requires a little street smarts. I wouldnt go solo into these areas at night, but if you do, stick to the main streets."

Stop for a wine or a beer, enjoy some bakery and simply forget your time for a while. Of course it is touristy but there are also places where the Catalans go which offer a good value for money. This place (like so many in the world) is bty best enjoyed before are after the big masses form the cruise ships are in.

They have a couple of tables at the back where you can sample some of the hams and have a drink of local wine. What a great way.

The cathedral is quite magnificent (although on our last trip everyone had to leave - perhaps because of a very noisy, and at times a little unsettling, protest march which passed the cathedral on the way to Palau de la Generalitat. Still in the current economic climate in Spain, protests and demonstrations appear to be relatively common). As well as wonderful architecture, There are several Playas which provide peaceful places to sit during the day and are lively meeting places in the evening. There are plenty of places to have a meal or a drink or just sit and people-watch. There is generally something going on to entertain you when you have had enough of wandering through the many narrow streets and alleys.The Flamenco at Tarantos in Placa Reial is a low cost opportuntiy to see traditional, intimate Flamenco shows at a fraction of the cost of some of some of the bigger venues (book online and you can buy tickets at 8 euros instead of 10 on the door). As in most other cities it is important to keep your wits about you. While the area is full of honest, friendly and charming people there are a few less savoury characters to be found so keep an eye on your possessions and be aware of what is going on around you."

What I like most about the narrow, winding alleys is that you can approach a plaza or an intersection from a different lane and it WILL look completely different from that angle. You got to spend at least 3 to 4 hours wandering in this atmospheric district."

There are numerous squares, some small, some large and most will have one or more cafes or restaurants which are generally much better value than those found on the Ramblas and a lot quieter too!"

Things are always changing, but my favorite bar/cafe haunts for now are those around Plaza Traginers - Babel, Can Fly, Tres Flores and Andu. On Saturdays artists have permission to paint and display their paintings in the plaza, which sits in front of the old Roman Wall; it's a super lively and fun place to hang out, away from traffic. Babel and Can Fly and the fine restaurant El Salon all have seating in the plaza and there are usually some very good buskers around, too. Very near is the excellent restaurant L'Antic Bocoi del Gotic (reservations may be necessary). The only way to see the barrio is to walk - so forget a bicycle or a Segway. The beauty of the medieval buidlings is in the detail and you must walk to take it all in. Find a good guidebook and you're on your way. And if you're an art collector or simply appreciate local art, by all means don't miss the Sat. art fair at Traginers."

There are Gaudi sights in many of the squares. Look up to the sky to see his chimneys. Look out for the Secret Square. Cant tell you where this as we feel across it by chance. It is the site where many children were killed by a bomb. You can still see the damage on the walls. George Orwell Square is a great watering hole. We much prefered the narrow roads to the Rambla.

For us, this is part of the whole experience.....just don't do it while you are hungry and tired.There are many Placa's in the Gothic quarter and some you will find their own style and options of food and bars to relax at.Yes, at times you will feel like it is a dodgy part of town but it is the character of the Gothic Quarter so take it all in.I would say you need to look out more for pick pocketers on busy Las Ramblas more than anything.Enjoy and take it all in!"

The area around the Cathedral is a must do. If visiting the cathedral, make sure you dress appropriately. Also, check the hours for mass because visitation will be limited."

The rest of the quarter has English signs and tons of atmosphere as well as excellent musician buskers to entertain you. Consider taking the elevator up to the top of the cathedral (about 2.5 Euros beyond the admission price to the cathedral). The view of the old town and some Barcelona towers is very good.

Beware that shops dont start opening until around 10am, but most do stay open until 9pm. However, i wouldnt advise to go wandering around them after 9 as they do get very dark once the sun goes down. However, its very nice to stroll around them in the afernoon. Some of the shops are amazing and you get all sorts of weird and wonderful things. If you go farther in, you will end up walking into a part of town called el bourne or something and thats also very nice with nice shops and restaurants. Dont be afraid to explore the gothic area or get lost down it streets, No matter where we wondered we always seemed to come back out onto Las Ramblas eventually or stumble upon one of the many metro stations."

These districts are a maze of narrow (often pedestrianised) streets buzzing with shoppers and tourists taking in the atmosphere created by both the architectural delights and the myriad of small and unique shops. Squares filled with dining tables will suddenly appear, and performance artists can usually be found entertaining the crowds in front of the large cathedral. In terms of pure interest and atmosphere it puts the more famous Ramblas to shame. However (and this probably applies everywhere in Barcelona) it is very easy to become a victim of petty crime in these streets, either because you are caught up in throng and can get pickpocketed or (as in our case) you find yourself in a quiet sidestreet and fall victim to a snatch and run merchant. Don't let this put you off - but if possible do not wear jewellery or expensive watches or carry a handbag. Coming from the UK this seems over cautious - but it is a sad truth (in our experience, and having joined a queue of other \"victims\" the next day at the police station) that Barcelona's reputation for crime is valid."

I had been told by someone in my home town about a restaurant in the Gothic Quarter that was frequented by Salvador Dali, but I had no idea how to locate it. I found it my last full day in Barcelona by accident (but just after I had eaten lunch), so I would have needed another day to sample it--IF I could have repeated whatever route I had taken.But that's no big deal. It's fairly simple to locate the large cathedral in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, but everything else you find is a pleasant bonus."

Pick a street, take a walk, turn left, turn right, have a bite here, stop there for a drink, check out that shop. We really loved just wandering, and we spent several days doing just that. The area is not packed with tourists, nor is it so off-the-main-beat as to be seem vacant. Without exception, the shop-keepers, bartenders, and waiters (not many waitresses in those older places) were exceptionally friendly."

I am definitely a believer in global warming now. I was in Spain 30 years ago and cannot remember it being as hot and uncomfortable as it was on this visit. There is simply no way anyone of any age can go outside during the afternoon without dire health consequences. It is as though you are stepping into a sauna and it just drains all of the energy from your body. I am a regular at the gym, doing an hour of cardio each day, and I was exhausted after five minutes in the heat of the afternoon. We tried exploring this area again in the evening and it was a totally different experience. It is a quaint and fun to explore section of Barcelona, but it too is filled with tourist trap restaurants and souvenir shops. I could not find many sights or shops worth spending money in. I found this true of much of Barcelona. The town seems to be a hangout for young people and not much else. It reminds me of the Jersey Shore here at home. Snooki would fit right in."

I've been living in Europe for almost 2 years, and out of all the places I've visited, walking through Barri Gotic finally made me feel like I'm now in \"Europe.\" It's hard to explain. I've been to Venice, Paris, Amsterdam, London, all over Germany, Austria, Switzerland, etc. I think it's the ambiance, architecture, and the fact that locals take residence in all the apartments and hang their laundry. Even with a bunch of tourists walking around, the corridors just didn't have that \"touristy\" feel to it at all. The place was not commercialized, and the restaurants and stores were authentic. If you come to Barcelona and miss walking through this place, you'll definitely miss out on what Barcelona is all about. The best way to experience this is to start walking from Ramblas street (The Touristy Street) and start walking along the Carrer de la Princessa (with a few detours here and there) towards the Citadel Park, where you can enjoy the beautiful fountains."

Many restaurants are located in these streets, some of them having many dried hams hanging from the ceiling, and in hot days \"gloomy\" appearance of the streets - as in some not much of the light comes from the skies - will provide you a good shelter from a strong sun.

I loved walking through all the small pedestrian streets and running into little cafes, street musicians, fountains, and courtyards. It really is a great place to walk. It is also right next to a busy shopping area and not too far distant from Las Ramblas. It's a little difficult if you have a car because a lot of the streets close off on the weekends and you might be stuck trying to get in, but that's the charm of this old quarter."

I think that some of the other reviewers did not know where they had visited when there are comments such as \u201cLike a big dirty old shopping mall\"! (The Barri Gotic is simply not like this.) But then again I overheard an American couple saying \"Gee, Mildred, just look at that wall with the tree growing out of it!\" - don't these folks know how to build a decent wall?) This was of course a reference to a two thousand plus year old Roman ruins of the city ramparts of the Barri in the wonderful city of Barcelona.

There is a refund office next to the tourist information at Placa de Catalunya, situated at the city end of la Rambla. It is not necessary to take the items to the refund office just passport and travel details. Beware that they charge a hefty fee for the service - about 25% of the refund, but the bright side is you get 75% in cash. They take you credit card as security so that you complete the airport inspection.You have to complete the paperwork at the airport police office far left back of the main terminal at the airport and take the items for inspection. You have to take a number and wait outside the police area until called - this can take 20 to 30 minutes, so leave extra time! At least they open 24 hours a day!El Corte Ingles is large enough to have their own refund system on the basement level of the main store and they process the transaction as a credit to credit card or cash with much lower percentage fees. Again you will have the card charged for the refund if you do not complete the airport documentation. This feature makes shopping for common items much more attractive at El Corte Ingles."

You can still have a pleasant enough afternoon wandering around it. BUT, short of padlocking your belongings to your torso, there's no way of keeping your bags safe here! Don't listen to guidebooks that say the Ramblas is the most dangerous area for pickpockets and bag-snatchers - it's also this area, and pretty much everywhere else in Barcelona too! I've traveled and lived in major cities for over a decade and have excellent street smarts. This is the only place I've EVER had anything stolen. My purse was literally snatched right out from under my feet at a quiet indoor restaurant with CCTV surveillance - even if you take all reasonable precautions, the professional bag-snatchers here can still get your things! Police were sympathetic but essentially have no hope of catching the person or retrieving any of my belongings at all. If you're even thinking of coming to Barcelona, don't bring anything you value at all, and make sure your insurance is up to date and covers theft while traveling (travel insurance won't do this, make sure your home or renters' insurace does)"

Probably the best way is to take one of the walking tours. I just like to go in the old cafes and bars and to see the old walls and wonder \"what did they use this for?\" It's quite good as occassionally they have plaques on the wall telling you about the history of what you have visited. The best way to visit the Gothic Quarter is simply to keep wandering down all the tiniest and narrowest streets. Don't worry - you cannot get lost. SImply ask for \"Las Ramblas\" and you will be there in 100 yards. We called in a 'locals cafe' three times eating the roast chicken, sausages and tapas. It was briliiant."

It is a must to walk here and admire the stones themselves with gargoyles and many architectural touches. During the warm weather there is a particular odor that reminds you of centuries of human habitation.Basically, you should spend an afternoon here to get a feel for the city before you move on to the more uptown venues and, of course the Gaudi buildings."

The maze of lanes and alleys seems almost endless and it feels like each step takes you further back in time. It is also so large that it is easy to find quiet areas where you can just let your imagination go. Cities and large areas like this are always very hard to review and describe simply because there is so much and each persons perception is different but I would heartily recommend going for a leisurely walk around here just exploring. It's hard to take it all in, there is so much going on above as well as below and at eye level. Just remember to look down now and then or you'll be tripping over the cobbles!"

You can get a tour by walking La Rambla street, we turned off right by the Macdonalds sign and within minutes were by the Tourist Info Office were we bought tickets for the tour that morning. Tour guide gave us headsets so we could always hear her explanations etc. It's a good way to see a part of Barcelona and learn a little about the history that you might otherwise miss on your own. You can even do the Cathedral after the tour as it is located in the area and it will be easy enough to find on your own. Lots of little shops to poke into and plenty of eating places, including a delicious Gellato ice cream after a hot day. If you have 3 or more days in Barcelona this is worth doing and let's you step back in time."

Although the Gothic Quarter is considered a 'must-see' site in all of the guidebooks, there really isn't much to see after you've wandered down one street after another. A few shops crop up here and there, along with the ubiquitous coffee/pastry shops (the staff were always very friendly at these shops, so feel free to drop in anywhere for a break). For a better idea of how the average Barcelonians live, head to the neighborhoods north of the Avenue Diaganol or closer to the university & museums."

This time though , we took a guided walking tour with Travel bar and we saw the Quarter with a different perspective .  Barri Gotic has so much history , so much architecture that it is impossible to fully see it on a single visit . There are many excellent bars and caf\u00e9s to take a break during day time and plentiful of restaurants to have dinner later on . We will surely go again on our next trip to Barcelona"

I loved the street performers... particularly the acrobatic group which is always there, often near the Roman wall or cathedral in an open area. They are chased off by the police but oh my goodness, they always put on a wonderful show. They simply pick up and move to another location. Shopping is good, eating is easy. Don't take photos of the people who are dressed up unless you're prepared to pay... that's a common mistake Americans make. Barri Gotic is a don't miss if you're in Barcelona."

You'll find shops, barbershops, restaurants and more walking through these alleys. And the buildings are just amazing, really old with so much history. I probably visited the barri gothic like 3 times while i was in Barcelona. The only thing i regret is not experiencing the night life and bar scene around here.

The narrow streets have no vehicular traffic as many of the buildings that had been there since Roman times are so close to each other. I enjoyed walking through those alleyways that are full of pretty shops & tapas bars. The labyrinth of these narrow streets take you to the old Jewish quarter and the majextic buildings fram medieval times. The streets end in squares or plazas that introduce you to more streets that tell stories of ancient Barcelona. I soaked all the beauty of the old buildings and walked in the Barri Gotic several times during my one week holiday in Barcelona."

Shoestores like Nine West and clothing stores like the Gap were hardly what I hoped to browse through in a European city's medieval heart. On the plus side, there are lots of street performers, but again, it was like being in the USA. We saw (amazing) break dancers who worked the crowd in English, an opera singer who was quite off-key, etc. Every musician performs next to a display of their CDs for you to buy. We nearly missed a pair of towers that were built by Romans, according to their sign (which happily included English). The sewer odor is noticeable, as others have said. The crowd is 100% tourist, not local at all, but everyone looked to be enjoying themselves. My husband liked the area because it reminded him of Sixth Street in Austin, Texas. That was exactly why I didn't care for it. Why cross the Atlantic Ocean to see what you can find in many cities in my own country?"

To re-energise, stop at a good tapas place - this is not meant to be discriminatory, but I found that restaurants ran by Spanish (rather than those of Indians or Middle Eastern origin) are more refined though more pricy, but I dined at a fine restaurant with 5 excellent tapas dishes, basket of bread, glass of Catalan wine, a creme catalan, coffee and a bottled mineral water for 33 Euro, as opposed to paying up to 20 Euro for the 2 tapas and a paella deals plus a drink which fills you up but doesn't really satisfy the inner gourmet ... :p"

YUM! Our second time through, we went back for churros and chocolate and shopping.

For those you like to stroll and let the streets surprise you rather than plan out your trips down to the minute, I recommending allocating a half-day or more to just walk the streets of the Gothic Quarter randomly. Let each block and turn you make surprise you with cafes, museums, history (roman ruins), Churches, shops, and potentially more risque things as well depending upon where/when you go. It was extremely safe and clean when I walked alone, although it was day-time when there were other walking around. Keep a map handy as the streets are not always in a grid pattern, so you can make a quick escape to a Metro stop or main street if needed. If you start at Placa Catalunya, it is all downhill through the quarter down to the water front where you can walk parallel to catch a subway ride back up to the Placa, hotels, etc."

            "review": "a place to trace the ancient heart of modernist Barcelona. The Gothic quarter is a compact precinct to walk around and seek out the ancient heart of Barcelona. Barcelona is best known for assertive modernism, but it is also an ancient city. It is actually pre-Gothic: the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Romans were here \u2013 although distinguishing old stones from new ones in this area is a matter of heated scholarly and aesthetic debate. Much that looks old here was built in the 20th century, but the area is genuinely very old.Look at downtown Barcelona in a street map, Google Maps or Google Earth, and you might notice something you've seen before in other old cities \u2013 a rounded lobe-shaped warren of narrow streets and tiny squares right in the heart of the city, adjoining the port. The approximate boundaries are the popular tourist promenade of Las Ramblas in the west; Carrer de Fontanella in the north; V\u00eda Laietana in the east; and the port in the south. These are \"tree rings\" marking the growth and outline of the oldest part of the city, the traces of long demolished ancient city walls and the layers of more than two thousand years of habitation, building and rebuilding.The area is only about 1.6km long and little more than 550m wide, so it is easy to walk around.What to do and see in the Gothic Quarter:\u2022 Barcelona Cathedral (a major sight in the Gothic tradition in its own right, with great views over the quarter from the roof);\u2022 The City History Museum of Barcelona in Palau Reial Mayor, former residence of the kings of Catalu\u00f1a and Aragon, in Pla\u00e7a del Rei (another significant sight in its own right);\u2022 Visit Pla\u00e7a Sant Jaume in the centre of the quarter, where Casa de la Cuitat (Town Hall) and the Palau de la Generalitat (regional government offices) are located; and\u2022 Just wander around the narrow streets, following your instincts and curiosity, enjoying the random happenings and discoveries of the day.\u2022 Link your visit in the Gothic Quarter with nearby sights, such as Palau G\u00fcell and the St Joseph's Market, off Las Ramblas on the western side; the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana, Museu Picasso and Church of Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar which are just a few blocks east of the quarter; or, to the south, the Museu D'Hist\u00f2ria De Catalunya and the old harbour and yacht basin area, with its many bars and seafood restaurants."

The 4cats still serves good food and a copy of their original menu designed by Picasso is on display.

I always got turned around, but that was half the fun. We found so many new places to shop and eat by simply meandering through the maze of streets. Love it!"

We fell in love with the Gothic Quarter, ended up spending time there almost every day while in Barcelona.You can just walk around, shop, relax, eat, have coffee, tappas, wine - whatever. We took a Wine and Tappas walking tour one of our first days - it was extremely helpful. Not only did we learn the history of the Gothic Quarter, the Las Ramblas and other important sites within - we learned how to order tappas!There are several museums (Picasso and others) in this section of Barcelona - and it's expectionally easy to get around - we never once felt crowded or hustled.Also took a Fat Tire bike tour from the center of the Gothic Quarter - one of our highlights!And don't miss the Food Market - amazing!Great memories from the Gothis Quarter.... :-)"

I loved exploring all the winding streets with the hope of getting lost......this is unlikely to happen though as we seemed to keep stumbling across shops we recognised! I loved seeing the little shops and cafes/restaurants. TripAdvisor have a great half day tour round the gothic quarter or if you fancy like we did, just take a wander round.On the first night, we ended up at a restaurant that looked very enchanting from the outside. The smell of incense hit you when you walked past, the dark red interior looked very mysterious and intriguing, almost Moroccan/Turkish inspired. I wish I knew the name of the place so I could recommend people NOT to go there for food!!! We went in, the only people in there but then it was early. We went for the set menu and as we were choosing, realised we could see the chef in the kitchen.....something we wished we couldn't see. He was coughing all over the place, the kitchen didn't look appealing at all and I saw him put something in the microwave. It was then I realised why the set menu had been so cheap compared to the other restaurants.... Our starter came out, fried potatoes with a spicy sauce, what turned out to be a common tapas dish in Barcelona. However, it was nothing more than chip oily scrappings we could've got from a kebab shop in the UK - complete with sauce out a squeasy bottle. We ate what we could, the wine and beer were awful so we decided to leave. To avoid arguments, we offered to pay for the menu (15 euros each) just so we could get out of there. The waitress was shocked at us leaving. I'm not a food snob at all but I do have a limit with what is edible! If you happen to pass a restaurant which smells of incense - avoid at all costs!!We took a walk down for a meal one night and came across a lovely restaurant, best meal of the trip. 3 course meal with wine set us back 80 euros but it really was a lovely little place"

Loved the Bocqueria market & pretty square to the side of it. Even managed to find a specialised shop (Ingenio) which I had read about in a magazine. It was really special to see it for real.

THis is an interesting place, especially I think for Americans/Australians.. people who are unused to medieval anything. The center, is extraordinarily crowded, and I come from New York. That should tell you something. I would definitely try to find out when OFF season is, and go then, but nevertheless, one does not go to a big city to escape people. Everyone wants to see the same things you do ! I liked the ancient streets, and stayed in apartments there. One of them had 90 steps to the apartment. ( who knew?) I was freaking out out one day when I had to do it three times.I liked that I could walk everywhere although it is easy to overdo...and I did not like that taxis couldn't come on those streets easily or private cars. If you have heavy suitcases, that's a consideration.I will say that some of them early morning are shockingly noisy if you have an apt facing the street, and late nights as well with rowdy tourists..so I would think carefully about staying there. Also, walking the isolated curly winding medieval ..almost alleys? If your instincts are telling you not to when it is ..say late, or early ? follow them. Dec 26 early morning (8:30) I took a short cut through them and saw what is probably a pretty typical theft in progress..it was jarring. The Gothic quarter has a very diff appeal from the others."

Gothic quarter in the evening had whole different atmosphere. It was very romantic. Day and night, you can hear live music and singing from every corner. One day we did self guided tour visiting Placa Nova(Christmas market in front of the Cathedral), Cathedral(many works were undergoing), Placa de sant Felipe Neri(you can still see some bomb damage on the wall from civil war), Casa de l'Ardiaca(Deacon's house, don't miss the post box with doves and turtles in front of the building. small courtyard and upstairs terrace are nice and quiet), Temple d'Augustus(you can see Roman pillars), Placa del Rei, Placa de Sant Just, Pati de Llimona, Roman walls. We had couple of nice cafe and sweets at Meson del Cafe on Carrer de la Liibreteria. It was a charming old cafe.

This is a great place to pocket your guide book and just let the intrigue of the narrow winding lanes beckon to your curiosity. The Romans were here and some of their walls and towers are still standing and incorporated into buildings. We thoroughly enjoyed walking about this area and \u201cdiscovering\u201d the remaining 2000 year old columns of the Temple of Augustus. And once you are exploring the Cathedral and its adjoining cloister courtyards, take time away from listening to the geese and the small fountain of St George to look down at your feet. You are walking on the tombstones of some of Barcelona\u2019s early leading families. Several days a week there is an outdoor market in front of the Cathedral and on Saturdays at 12 noon you can see the intricate footsteps of the Sardana dancers. As you walk about, you will hear musicians playing in various courtyards---stop, relax and enjoy. But make sure you toss in some euros for the entertainment. Finally, while walking about this delightful area, try to find Casa de l\u2019Ardiaca. If it is open, walk into the courtyard and up the stairs to the open second floor. And on you way out, look for the marble sculpture of swallows and a turtle designed by Lluis Montaner who conceived of the Music Palace."

There is a Cathedral Museum that is quite good, although you have to go up many steps because there are so many levels. Plenty of art work in this museum. There is a Neo-Gothic bridge on Bisbe Street that calls attention because it passes over the narrow street and yet the bridge is covered with a structure that looks like part of a Cathedral, with its pointed arch windows. There is a wonderful museum called the Frederic Mares Museum that has plenty of Gothic art. I saw so many large sculptures of Christ on the crucifix hanging on the walls of the museum. The Church of Santa Maria del Mar is a wonderful Gothic church. It is too bad that the retables of the chapels were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War.Another wonderful museum is the small Barbier-Mueller Museum of Precolumbian Art, showing art of the Inca Trail of South America. Opposite it is the famous Picasso Museum. The Gothic Quarter is filled with beautiful old buildings that have reached our time and are still in use. This is really amazing."

The atmosphere of the place just screams authenticity (whether this is true or not I don't really care!) and the roman temple ruins tucked away in a quiet corner of an inauspicious street are unreal! There are probably loads of guided walks avaible on the net and in other guide books but we followed the one in the Time Out guide and it prooved to be really good; handily enough it ends at the Piccaso Museum so if you haven't had enough culture for the day you can pop in there or (as we did) simply visit their fantastic restaurant/bar for a great glass of wine!"
