We are members and often go there on a weekly basis. It's well planned with ample space for kids and adults to enjoy themselves. Great family friendly facilities that is clean and well serviced. The service is truly on point, professional and very friendly. They have age- appropriate activities and projects according to the seasons. It's located at the V&A Waterfront so it's an ideal family place to hang-out. If you are finished at the Aquarium, you just walk out into the Waterfront which boasts hundreds of fun-filled activities and restaurants. I have a 3 years old so , who loves this place. We often enjoy the basement section for the small children. They have puppet shows, and a little play section for the little ones. They can easily play in this area for over an hour before continuing onto the different levels. Ideal place to meet up for a play date or host a private party. There are also adventures for older kids, like shark diving in their tank for kids 12 and over. They host sleep overs and penguin encounters but call to find out what would be the best activity for your child. It gets very very busy during peak holiday seasons and on weekends. So it's best to time your visit. If you enjoy large crowds, this is the place to go on a busy weekend or opt for a weekday for a quiet visit. It's big but not that big. After an hour or so it's time to move on. Pram friendly, baby changing facilities are great. So bring the whole family and don't forget the nanny so you can enjoy a cup of coffee while they run around or a shopping spree at the Waterfront"

You may have visited Cape Town, South Africa, and Africa to see nature (of all kinds) but you really are not going to see marine life up close unless you visit an aquarium, of which Cape Town has one. I havent been to Durban's one recently, and I am not sure if Port Elizabeth still has one, but I am confident in touting Cape Town's as probably the best in the country, by far.There are large tanks with viewing windows, containing many species including large sharks, as well as smaller tanks with other smaller species. Of particular interest is the penguin pool and the \"petting pond\" where even small children can touch rays. There is much more than this to see and I could go on for pages but go and see for yourself.Tip - Cape Town weather is notoriously fickle. At some time during your visit it might rain or be excessively windy. Pencil in a visit to the Aquarium, and keep it until you get one of those Cape Town days that makes normal outdoor activities impossible. Visit the Aquaruim on that day, enjoy the indoor activity, while you wait for the weather to improve, which it WILL."

My daughter (5) loves looking at the small stuff under a microscope, and dabbling in the touch pool, but her best is the kids area, where she gets to make a simple craft project and take it home, and to watch a puppet show. She also loves to see the jelly fish, spectacularly illuminated with UV light. From my perspective, the big tanks are great (predators in particular), but the penguins are also entertaining although very smelly.Unlike other top aquariums, there is no fancy moving walkway (underwater), but you can walk through a short tunnel in the predator tank, with sharks and rays and maybe a turtle swimming above you. The whole aquarium is well maintained and the staff are helpful but not overbearing.The emphasis is probably more on education than on entertainment - but we need to educate people so our oceans don't become barren!"

However, I came across advertising for diving at the aquarium, and gave it a try. It was more fun than I thought it would be - a different experience, for sure, than diving out in the ocean, but much more interesting than just being in a pool. The tank we were in had two sea turtles, both of which you could interact with, and one of which (bob) took quite an interest in the divers, and was rather fun to swim with. It was also pretty cool to make faces and wave at the aquarium visitors, especially the kids. If you are a licensed diver and have a few hours to spare in cape town, I'd recommend checking this out. One improvement that could be made is to the change room / showers - they are pretty small, and need more hooks!"

I remember loads of kelp, and just sitting there on the seats listening to the tranquil music and watching the kelp wave in the ocean. Now there is hardly any kelp there and there are so many fish in that tank. The glass passage under the ocean was closed - so no sharks. The Penguins were cute and was interesting to watch them feed. The Jelly fish area is OUTSTANDING! absolutely loved that. Its all dark and then the tank have these blue neon lights showing the jelly fish up in amazing light. Unfortunately - i personally thought that for the same price or really close to Ushaka has much more to offer. They have the seals, dolphins, sharks etc. However, my parent thought it was better then Ushaka. IF its a rainy day, then head to the aquarium....."

Viewing the fish is always a delight and there were quite a lot of people for a Friday afternoon. Since our last visit the new tunnel has been completed. The I & J Predator tanks are much smaller and lots of the big fish and sharks are gone. I like the rock formations especially the one that looks like a hole in the wall.The Kelp forest are still there for now but work on that and the original Predator tanks should hopefully be something to look forward to. There are (in my opinion) more and different fish. I love taking photos and maybe I have taken duplicates. My grandson would only touched the little orange starfish but not the Anemones - he said \"they moving\". He loves the turtle in the Predator tank - he says \"she can see me\". She is beautiful . We didn't view but the Microscope exhibit should be interesting."

This one is about small-mid sized and well laid out. What I liked about this aquarium is that they have done a great job with signage at each tank or enclosure to help you identify the species within. They have a great jellyfish section (lit up with eerie purple lighting to simulate underwater conditions). A section with penguins and a kelp forest tank. They have two daily feedings at the giant central fish tank: noon and 1400. The noon feeding is a diver feeding (as opposed to drop feeding at 1400). Their loggerhead turtle \"Yoshi\" is a hoot to watch and acts like she wants to play and interact with the dive staff - never thought turtles could connect this much with humans. The cool thing is that the diver feeding the fish is wired up to a microphone and you can hear his commentary live over the PA while he works with the fish. There is a staff member that facilitates things on the \"land animal\" side of the glass (actually it's acrylic but who's checking). And, yes, you can ask questions! The dive feeding demonstration was certainly the highlight of our visit and I highly recommend you time your visit to attend (take your positions about 15mins ahead of start time)."

A minor point perhaps, albeit annoying: at one of the exhibits, they had set up a camera which advertised on a big sign above it that you could get a free picture. You stand in front of the camera and await the countdown for the picture to be taken, and it appears on the screen with others' photos. But instead of printing the photo for you, they refer you to their website and tell you to \"follow the link\" -- only there is no link there to follow, at least not that I was able to find (which disappointed my children, who wanted to see the photos we had taken). All in all, it's a place you CAN visit, especially if you have children who like fish, but there's no need to set aside more than an hour for this activity."

I've never seen such a large group before in an aquarium, its very relaxing watching them move around the tank.The main shark tank is undergoing reconstruction at the moment so you do miss that but everything is well maintained.

Really loved the new jellyfish exhibit, it's beautiful. And the new predator tank is stunning as well.Just know that when you go you will have to deal with selfish parents (and adults themselves), taking up all the space at many of the windows so that no one else can see.Otherwise I'm excited to see the old predator tank when it has finished reconstruction! The aquarium still remains a great place for children and adults alike! Educational and beautiful."

It's got a rainy morning figured out for the kids, with snacks, numerous windows into local sealife, a couple of step-inside exibits (clownfish being a huge draw thanks to Pixar's Nemo) and even a touchpool and penguin colony.

Very few people get the opportunity to see underwater life first hand through diving, so the Two Oceans Aquarium is the ideal place to visit when at the Waterfront in Cape Town. Of special interest are the feeding times, so when you plan your visit make sure that you get to see either the feeding of the penquins or the fish in general. Another tip (especially in tourist season) is to book your tickets over the Internet at their website, saving you time as there can be a long line otherwise. Centrally located in the V&A Waterfront within walking distance of many other attractions, be sure to include a visit in your schedule when in Cape Town."

As soon as we walk through the turnstiles and into the first display everyone I know, adult or child, is captivated. Who can fail to be fascinated, awed, and delighted? On this visit my companions (age ranges from 14 months to 73 years old!) and I were lucky enough to see the penguins and the rays and turtle being fed, to have a chance to try out microscopes (who knew what is in the water!!) and to learn lots of new things. The staff is always informative, helpful, kind and rewards interest with information. The displays are undergoing renovation in some parts and I can't wait to go back and see what has been done, I can't think of ways the aquarium could improve but I am sure the dedicated team there will make it even better. Plus - a big thank you to the lovely staff in the cafe who let us spread out all over the place, made endless concessions for the kids and did everything to help"

We moved to the AfriSam kids area, touching pools and penguin areas which were better for them. Loved the kids puzzles against the walls and new murals along with educational information. The new passage with overhead water was ok - it's brand new and I'd love to see more species of fish inside.The Shoreline Cafe outside but attached to the aquarium was lovely. We sat outside and watched all the activities in the Marian and the nearby seals. Had some great coffees and kids enjoyed their meals. "

They have a touch and feel area which is interesting. There a few enclosures (like a shell) where one can stand and click photos which look like you are inside the water. For the predators, they have a huge huge tank with glass walls. This is spectacular. They also have a person go inside and give feeds to the predator species.

I have visited aquaria all over the world, and Two Oceans is one of my favorites. They have areas you can walk through, so you don't feel so far removed from the beasties. One walk through area contains penguins and various other birds. It's fun to see the penguins and other birds interact. They're quite territorial. Two Oceans is also one of the few places where you can get within inches of the colorful and deadly mantis shrimp. Admittedly, it was very thick glass and a small, young mantis shrimp - but they are one of the world's most deadly animals. There are so many varied things to do at the aquarium that you can easily spend two or three hours and not be bored. Two Oceans is not an aquarium where you merely walk around and look at things in tanks. It is especially enjoyable on a hot day in Cape Town, as the aquarium is nice and cool inside. Don't miss the shark feeding times. And if you get tired, sit down and have an ice cream at the ice cream shop near the exit. Trip was actually in November 2013, not 2015. It was my second visit to the aquarium - the first being in 2006. It was an excellent experience both times."

The penguins feeding session is the most fun, and the clown's fish bubble is also cute. Apart from that the shark tank is very dated and with tired fishes. Don't expect to see the white sharks here, for those there's only the ocean with the cages tour."

However, the main auditorium where the feeding takes place is jam packed full of kids. Most of them run up to the glass and press their faces against it. Even though the staff tell them not to, they do it anyway, which of course ruins the view for everybody else. We got there well ahead of feeding time, chose a good viewing position and waited patiently for the feeding to start. Literally 30 seconds before the scheduled time (and in many cases after), people with no concern for others, thought that having kids entitled them to plonk themselves and their rabble on the floor right at the front, parking their buggies and pushchairs anywhere they felt like it. It was more like a playground with kids full of E numbers!I would go back, but it would be in the day during term time because unfortunately, uncontrolled children ruined it for me"

My grandson loves Pingu and I told him we going to see them at the 11h45 feeding time. His father(my son) though, said there's lots of time and of course we missed that. My grandson and his mum took their photo at the Nemo exhibit and he was enthralled. All the exhibits are beautiful and my grandson made his mum and dad crawl into little passageways behind some of them. He kept dragging us to go see other one fish (the penguins). No matter how many times you go it is so beautiful to see the different species.The Yellowtails and some other fish in the I & J Predator tank are quite huge. The turtle is a real show off and swims close to the front of the tank. We also wanted to see the shark feeding time at 15h00( on a Sunday) so we took a pass out and had lunch in the cafe on the premises. We watched the sharks (ragged tooth), turtle and mantaray being fed. There is a touch tank and it is good for the little (and not so little) ones to touch the anemones and star fish. There is also a kiddies play area. It is a good excursion for schools and they sometimes have sleepovers"

The penguine pool always makes me a little aad but a good reminder of the impact himans have on our oceans leaving little creatures in need of rehabilitation spaces like this.

This aquarium has some really large tanks and you can spend all day looking at them. It's also very educational and interactive for kids. They have a touch and feel section, where kids can touch starfish and sea cucumbers and other animals. They also have a microscope area where they show you sea horses under a microscope. Upstairs is a cute penguin area where you can watch them playing. We had a very enjoyable afternoon here and I would definitely recommend a visit."

The kit was in good condition and the overall experience ran very smoothly. Once in the tank we had a good time to swim around and admire the sharks. Although you have to watch out for the big boss which is the turtle she owns that tank! The kelp dive was surprisingly more fun though as we got to feed the fish under the water which was amazing as they come straight at you - obviously an experience you cannot have in the sea so left me feeling very happy swimming in the beautiful forest of kelp!Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to explore the whole aquarium but from what I did see was very well designed and kept.

It appears to be more of something they came up with to fill the building rather than a planned aquarium.They have fish and sea life, many in small tank in the walls. A couple of large tanks as well, but seems confused as they basically throw a bunch of ocean fish in with no real \"draw\" to the exhibit. It looks like they are renovating, so maybe this is the thrown-together, \"got to open now\" version 1.0.Has potential, but I'd like to see them pull it together so you feel like you swam around the ocean gaining knowledge about the indigenous sea life in a logical progression rather than a shot-gun of fish tanks and exhibits."

We moved rather slowly because we were visiting with the kids but were done seeing all the exhibits in under two hours. I wouldn't say that the aquarium is a must-see when visiting Cape Town but if you find yourself at the V&A Waterfront with some extra time or if you're traveling with kids as I was, it is definitely worth a visit.Their focus is showcasing the marine life of the two oceans that border the Cape Peninsula, the Atlantic and Indian oceans. Among others they have penguins, turtles, sharks, rays and a kelp forest. Fun and educational for all ages. Some exhibits allow for the visitor to crawl inside - the clown fish aquarium for example - and they have a 'touch and feel' pool where kids can touch shells, sea stars, algae and the like.At the entrance they stamp your hand and that allows one to exit and enter as many times as they like during the day."

Some aquariums actually gave the visitor a space to crawl inside and there were touching exhibits, which excited the children..As an older, lone traveller, I was hoping to get some good photographs and see more large sharks. I did get some reasonable shots, but nothing too fantastic.I am no expert, but perhaps a guide to taking good shots and where to stand in such a dark environment, may have been idea. Some people were using direct flash photography, against the glass. They must have got some superb pictures of themselves.The larger tanks, had some amazing fish, possibly magnified by the glass. The combination of the tank glass and dark environment, made it difficult to get any astounding photographic results, even with a reasonable camera.The perspective was also impossible to gauge without involving some person in the picture. You can get some strange looks from people."

The staff stamp your wrist with invisible ink, which is then scanned at the entry turnstile under an ultra violet beam, and in you go. Quite the oddest admission procedure, but it works!As for the aquarium, it kept us interested for an hour and 15 minutes. Highlights are Africa's only kelp forest exhibit and the penguin beach. Most visitors are families with young children, so the whole place is a bit of a crazy zoo.Compared with other aquariums we have visited, it's quite small.

It was buzzing with School trips it was obvious all the children were enjoying their visit as we were. One of the tanks was laid out as a kelp farm from the roots to the tops that you see along the coast.The Aquarium was well laid out with clear descriptions and well kept.It was interesting to see and read about the penguins some had been rescued and others bred in the Aquarium. We had seen them in the wild at Betty's Bay and some of these had ended up in the Aquarium for one reason or another."

This one is small but has a very diverse population of species that come from both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. They had a great predator tank and we were able to take advantage of one of their programs that allowed us to learn how to scuba dive in the morning and then dive in the shark tank in the afternoon. For someone coming from the US (or for anyone coming from the Eurozone or UK)- this was a very cheap endeavor that we could have never done at home. We spent 30 minutes in the tank with two certified divers and got to experience the aquatic life close up. I would highly recommend, especially if you go shark cage diving and the water is too cloudy to make out the sharks."

I landed on the \"Predator Exhibit\" dive at Two Oceans.The whole experience moved like a well oiled machine and soon after arriving for my dive I was in the water swimming next to Ragged Toothed sharks, a turtle, yellow tail and others.Not scary at all, in fact it was quite relaxing to swim around with the sharks. Quite fun to also look back at tourists on the otherside of the aquarium glass and feel like a bit of an attraction yourself.For those skeptics about the conservation side of this, they catch and release these predators every 2-3 years (they can live for up to 30 years), so they don't spend their whole life in a cage. I'm sure there are arguments for keeping these predators in the wild, but this seems to present itself as a reasonably sustainable solution."

We took our 2 1/2 year old grandson to the aquarium the other afternoon and had a great time from the moment we arrived..... the nice man on the door was lovely towards this wide eyed little boy and spoke to him face to face and told him to 'have a good time'. I had not visited the aquarium for quite a few years and it has really developed. Our grandson loved the penguins, the neon jelly fish and was totally captivated by the kelp and fish in the tank - and fancy seeing divers in there too! He was also brave enough to venture into the display that makes you look like you are in the actual tank. Thank you to all the staff for making our trip most enjoyable."

If you go regularly I would advise to get annual membership for you and the family. Kids enjoy not only the memorable experience of 'swimming' with Nemo, but also enjoy the fantastical world of sharks, giant crabs and 'surfs up' with the penguins. Loads of playtime in sand pits and a puppet show (occasional) for alternative entertainment is also available. To round it off, be sure to capture the moment with the Facebook camera....and then go for ice-cream and enjoy the harbour activities."

It is said that the sharks' metabolism is very slow so they can go on for about a week without food, something I never knew!! So when you see them not attacking others you must know that they are really full. Another fascinating thing was seeing penguins when they are fed. We also saw a huge sea tattle in the same tank as other fishes and sharks. It is said that the tattle is 20 years old. We really had an interesting experience."

Sadly, with masses of people and thousands of somewhat unhappy children, the air conditioning could not cope with the crowds. It was hot and stuffy. Moreover, there truly are not many fish tanks. Admittedly, the fish, sea horses and coral are beautiful. And, the aquarium tries to make the place more \"child friendly\" by allowing children to crawl through tunnels and pop up in the middle of a fish tank for a parent photo op. However, the aquarium is tiny and, as mentioned in my title, the otter exhibit featured a skeleton of an otter hanging over the pool of water."

He took us through the aquarium up to the Rockhopper penguin area and we were introduced to the crew. We were given towels for our laps and the penguins immediately hopped onto our laps as soon as we sat down. They were very cute and it was a treat to spend some time with them. Vernon told us all about them for about 30 minutes, then it was time for their daily swim around the exhibit. Immediately after our penguin encounter was feeding time for the African penguins in their exhibit downstairs. We spent about another hour or so going around the rest of the aquarium. The aquarium itself has many impressive exhibits, but the penguin encounter was by far the highlight! The encounter price includes admission to the rest of the aquarium, so it's really a great deal."

The visit to the aquarium is really educative, with beautiful creatures. and also you get to have fun by taking goofy photos around the nemos!!!!! It is recommended to visit here on Sunday Afternoon, from 2pm onwards as thatz when you will see the penguins being fed, and also the sharks, and Yoshi too!!!!! :-)A must visit place!!!!!!

We got there at about ten in the morning and there was quite a few people but not to the point where it is unbearable. Inside there was a lively vibe and the animal-life was just amazing. I have not been to any other aquariums but I think it is safe to say that they have a rather big variety of animals. The reason why I say animals instead of sea-life is because they have special frog and penguin exhibits. They also had a lot of interactive facilities where you could for example hold a starfish or look at the development of octopus babies. My favourite part was the I&J Predator exhibit. It is a 2-million-litre exhibit which houses sharks, schools of fish, turtles and various other things. The best part about it is that you can completely walk around it and thus see everything from the fishes' point of view. For a day with friends or family I would definitely recommend it"

The aquarium is pushchair friendly and there are baby changing facilities. If going in term time beware the hordes of school trips.The tanks are clean and have lots of information about their contents. The explore ponds are great, where you can gently handle some inhabitants of rock pools. The Snack Shack is a great place for toddlers to run around but there are no healthy snacks to be had. The aquarium restaurant has a better selection. The kelp tank was fascinating and the shark tank has great visibility. The penguins are really cute and so close. Staff are really friendly and polite and the gift shop is great. You can easily spend most of a day inside."

I was volunteering at Marine Dynamics and on the last day they left early so we could go see the Two Oceans Aquarium and go diving in the tanks. We had a Great time. Everything ran smoothly, the Dive Masters were wonderful and took time to make sure you were fitted out correctly. We spent an hour diving in the Predator tank and I gotta tell ya, it was Great! They even had showers to use before changing once you were out of the water. The Penguin area is great but always crowded when they are feeding them. All in all a great experience and you should not miss this while you are in Cape Town!"

You might as well know that I've never visited an aquarium before so I may not be the best person to rate this place, but we all absolutely loved it. We were 3 adults and a baby of 10-months, and she was as mesmerised as we were by all the colour and movement. So many different species, heart-stoppingly close encounters with huge predators, little pop-up spaces in the middle of some tanks that you can crawl into and then stand up and feel as if you're in the water with the fish, a fabulous tank of Nemos, an interactive anenome display, lots of penguins, lots of happy visitors, plus its clean and well kept and has a good kids play area... it was a great way to spend a chilly afternoon."

A top class aquarium, The Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town, rates among some of the best in the world, and I am not just saying that because my late husband, Omar Cassim (who worked for Aquatek) installed the life support systems in the tanks. The most fascinating \"room\" for me in the aquarium in the giant kelp. Fish weave in out out among the tall swaying sea plants. Children especially love this room and I think it is the enormity of the tank rising more than 12 feet high. Another high light are the penguins. As everyone knows penguins are only found in the southern hemisphere and mostly at the south pole - Antarctica but in South Africa we are lucky to have them at Boulders Beach, another great tourist attraction. At this beach the inquisitive penguins will come up to you without fear of humans. Everyone loves penguins. Many people rave about the sharks but I am not a big fan. The aquarium is a must see and since it is right at the Cape Town Sight-seeing open air tour bus, multiple joys on your holiday can be combined: the aquarium, plus shopping in the Waterfront, plus dining in the Waterfront, plus a trip around the city on the tour bus to as far as Camps Bay on one route and Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens on a second route. For the children, you can also have them join the regular sleep-overs inside the aquarium. Kids bring along their sleeping bags and teddy bear / soft toy and voila! Camp out in the aquarium!"

Great for a wet day in Cape Town - the events in the aquarium are engaging and informative for all the family - especially interesting in terms of endangered species etc - my kids came away with lots of good insights and it has changed their behaviour in terms of what they choose to eat. The events are pretty diverse and aimed at a varied age group which is really nice to see (story telling through to feeding).Never a big fan of captive wildlife - even fish - but the enclosures and tanks seemed a good size and staff obviously care a lot about them all. My main issue was the penguin area - I guess it is for their rehabilitation but given you can pop down the coast and see them in the wild it seemed odd to house them here.Cafe is also pretty good and the route round the aquarium makes for a logical narrative and a fun visit."

It might have lesser exhibits, but definitely has the best ones of both the oceans and southern african waters. Each presenter was just willing to share as much information with each one of us, making the trip an amazing learning experience. We were also amazed by the conservation work the aquarium does. Will definitely be there again when we are in Cape town again!!"

Could do with replacing the tanks as obviously cleaning isn't helping. The staff are okay but mostly absent or having conversation amongst themselves.The penguin enclosure is an overpowering smell which is revolting. I understand penguins are the kind of animals that no matter how much upkeep they are given are bound to smell but this takes it to a whole new level. The place is worn unfortunately and looks tired. You can do the whole place in under an hour which isn't right. It's not a day trip. Screaming children and kids running around are constant. It's not outrageous to put up signs asking children to remain attended to at all times. The shark show is nice but the sharks unfortunately aren't very impressive and they are supposed to be the main attraction, and to have fish on display that are bleeding and shredded is not pleasant. The turtle is gorgeous but I believe they should have a separate section of more than one turtle and give them a beach area. The turtle has no choice to enjoy sand and air, she/he must swim around in circles all day with the fish. Very sad"

But when you get in and go through the first floor it's just great, amazing and WOW! The first floor is mostly about smaller fishes (Nemo, squid, ...) and then you get to the second floor with funny looking penguins. Those guys do not realize that, but they're better than those ones on Boulders beach."

We were meant to be heading to Robben Island but the weather meant all trips to the Island were cancelled, so we spent the morning at the Two Oceans Aquarium.We really enjoyed our visit although it's not a huge aquarium. All the tanks were clean and crystal clear with good information boards next to the tank. We loved the Nemo tank (who wouldn't!) and pleased to see that the aquarium pretty much focussed around the oceans around Southern Africa. The tank with the sea kelp was fab and helped you understand what was living in the sea around you. Our son loved the predator tank with the ragged tooth shark and was very impressed with the fish that was still alive having had two chunks taken out of him!!We had completed a circuit of the aquarium and decided to head back to watch the penguin feeding. There were also school visits taking place and if you sit quietly at the back, you get to learn more about the sealife than just reading the info - great questions from the school kids! One huge plus point to the aquarium was the \"photo booth\" camera before doing into the penguins ... all photos taken are uploaded to a website accessible FREE via facebook (you can download or have an email copy sent to you) - our son loved it as did everyone else. I wish the tourist places in the UK whould follow your lead rather than use photos as a pure money making exercise as only a small minority of people buy. This way I am sure everyone will download and share their \"Two Oceans Aquarium\" photos."

Modern aquariums in general, and the Two Oceans Aquarium in particular, has HUGE windows, and it is easy to imagine you are right in there with the fish or sharks. With SCUBA diving so prohibitively expensive, visiting this aquarium is still the cheapest and most satisfying way to see the fish-life that is found in our local seas. The kelp forest is my favourite by far, and it is so relaxing to sit there and watch the kelp sway to and fro and to and fro and.....oops, I just fell asleep!"

We needed a weather day option as we were visiting Cape Town in the winter so we booked a dive experience at the aquarium.The shark diving in the ocean is completely weather dependent and we wanted to have a guaranteed dive experience. We booked the dive experience with the aquarium and as some of us were not dive certified we did the Discover Scuba course with Iain who is associated with the aquarium.He gave a great and easy to do course. We traveled to a nearby military base to do the dive course and Iain guided us through the technicalities of diving. It was great to have all of the dive scenarios practiced in a pool first.We then returned for our dive at the aquarium. We first dived in the Predator tank. It was fantastic to be so close to Ragged Tooth sharks in complete safety. The dive was very easy and Iain was attentive and made sure we were all comfortable and safe at all times.The experienced divers then had the great opportunity to dive in the Kelp tank. This was really pretty and was like diving in the kelp in the ocean without the potential surprise of a predator. The fish were inquisitive and very pretty and the tank really pretty to dive in. One can see why only sufficiently qualified divers can dive there as it is moderately technical as well as the delicate kelp can't be damaged.The only way to experience sea life and what an honour to have done it."

It's not really big enough for parents to accompany :) We also liked the stadium seating around the huge aquarium, was a nice place to sit and rest and let our son climb up and down the steps. The penguins were great, more specious than you can see at Boulders, though obviously you go to boulders to see thousands of them in a natural habitat. It's very pricey, as these types of attractions seem to be. There's a little touch tank for kids to feel, and in general, we'd recommend it for families who have gone to aquariums before, it has enough nice things to offer. Of course, it can be very crowded and full of screaming kids. Duh. Still fun."

The Two Oceans Aquarium, in the V&A Waterfront complex, is well worth a visit.I found it interesting since it compares and contrasts the differences between the fish and plants found in the Atlantic (a turbulent and colder ocean) with those filling the same ecological niche in the Indian Ocean (a warmer and more placid ocean and thus in major aspects a different environment). The similarities are striking, but the differences can be amazing.It's not that large as aquariums go, and you can see pretty much what you want to in a morning or afternoon; indeed, a couple hours would give you most of the high points. There's something for everyone, even the kids - especially if they like sharks. And don't forget to check out the penguins (yes, they have penguins in South Africa)."

Cameras are allowed and don't forget to visit the 360 degree shark tank which is under the water and of course the penguins!"

We took our children to Cape Town as part of their Christmas gift, and Two Oceans Aquarium was absolutely the biggest highlight for them. The exhibits are beautifully done, and the layout is easy for all ages: steps up so little people can see into tanks, amazing \"bubble\" tanks children can climb into and watch fish up close, and great hands-on exhibits that allow kids to touch urchins and corals and more. There is also push-chair rental if you've got an infant or toddler who needs one, and the museum has ramps everywhere, making it friendly to wheelchairs as well.The aquarium's location on the Waterfront makes it a great day out, as you can get your hand stamped, go out for a stroll or to eat (if you don't plan to eat in the Two Oceans Cafe'), then return later to see more. Our only disappointment was that the old warship anchored in the harbor next to the aquarium isn't open for visitors. My little boys looked at it longingly as we walked past!"

Obviously the centre piece is the huge circular centre piece aquarium - I want one! Then by chance we actually visited on a Sunday so it was 'Shark Feeding Day' wow how exciting! We sat with the grandkids for about 30 minutes (you need to get sat down early because seating is limited) before the scheduled feeding time. Then the excitement mounted as divers appeared and then the presenter. Here we go fish carnage - how wrong. The sharks just wandered around with the divers almost having to force feed them. There was a bit of excitement however feeding the turtle was far more interesting. Perhaps the sharks were just having a quiet day.So the aquarium is brilliant seeing all sorts fish, and some are really big, swimming in a great environment but feeding time on a Sunday was a disappointment. My guess would be that if a shark is hungry then it will eat whatever and whenever it wants and in the tank there is plenty of options to have a different fish every day if it feels like it. On other days different feeding strategies are used so perhaps when they surface feed would be more interesting.One surprise was that the onsite caf\u00e9 was very good and so was the gift shop. Also if you take the open top bus ride (recommended by the way) like we did because it was too windy for the cable car to operate, then you do get a discount entering the aquarium."

I must mention that there was something unique about the whole attraction. Atmosphere was laid back and relaxed. In some areas there were some sofas placed to sit and enjoy aquarium. I was pleased with my visit. However I would suggest to improve penguin area.

It could be therapeutical and will definitely relax if you work a stressful job the rest of the year.I got an annual membership and went every few days while there for two months.

It contains fish which illustrate the variety found in the two oceans around South Africa, the Atlantic and Indian. My personal favourites were the Kelp Forest Tank of which there are only three in the world and the gigantic spiders crabs. And of course there are sharks and a tank full of 'nemos'. It is located in the V & A Waterfront by the City Sightseeing bus stop - easy to get to."

This Aquarium is educational in environmental sustainability, preserving nature and marine life.My favourite part of the Two Oceans Aquarium is the jelly fish, illuminated in such a way that you are awestruck by their movement and colours.Take along your family, friends, lover, or go solo.

She was completely engaged in the lavish exhibits and even I got caught up in the magic of underwater worlds. We sang soft lullabies to snoozing sea horses and laughed until our cheeks hurt as we stood inside the circular \"Nemo\" fish tank looking out at passing people through a dense shoal of lovely stripy fish. The interactive area was made more engaging by the staff who were sincerely interested in sharing the oceans with small children. The penguins were adorable too! The fact that here and there we came across a jungle gym or button to press or some other play activity made it easy to explore the entire aquarium over more than two hours. To complete the day, we had delicious milkshakes in the coffee shop and my goddaughter spent another happy hour playing with other children in a designated, equipped play area. The Two Oceans Aquarium was such a great place for quality bonding time that we now visit it regularly throughout the year - our first visit was in 2013."

Even if you have seen fish/aquatic life before, you will still be awestruck by the vast and diverse collection exhibited here. My kid really the enjoyed standing in the specially created area, in between the Clown Fish tank; it creates a cute illusion of being in the water with the fishes, from the outside. This may be one of the best aquariums in the world and easily the most child-friendly too.It was nice to witness the penguin feeding (happens daily at 11h45 and 14h30) and we also got a chance to see the shark feeding (only at 1500 on Sundays) with some interesting commentary. The interaction with the Starfish and Anemones at the Touch Pool, with the help of some friendly volunteers, was also pleasant.Once we finished our aquarium tour, we had some delicious snacks (mainly seafood) at the adjoining Shoreline Caf\u00e9.Must-see in Cape Town!"

Suddenly you realise you are being dwarfed by the size of an enormous tank with hundreds of fish from sharks and sting rays to small tropical fish and turtles. A crowd is gathering and suddenly you know why as four human legs appear in the water at the top of the tank, there follows a commentated feeding session by two divers one of who does most of the feeding while the other fends off the sharks with a long stick.You do not get a show like that at any aquarium we ever went to before."

The fish displays were well presented and the ocean life many and varied. We took time, unlike many other visitors, to stop at the microscope exhibition where the less glamorous and excedingly small sea life was on display. The presenter was well informed and interested in her subject; we would recommend a stop at this display.We enjoyed the penguins on the top floor and felt it was a couple of hours well spent"

Both are under 4 years old and they were captivated by just about everything! The teared around the ground floor looking at the various glass pools of manta ray, butterfly fish, moray eel etc and couldn't stop asking questions and showing us their new discoveries.They loved the touch/learning pool where patient staff let them touch various seaweeds, sea urchins and a hermit crab. They were super excited to see the 'talking frogs' which was a puppet show about the importance of frogs in our ecology (the content was a little lost on them and the show was a little silly- but I guess I am not its target demographic).The shark tank was a major highlight too. It was a wonderful, super stimulating outing for small children. As an adult who is deeply interested in the preservation of our oceans I also loved it. I thought it was really well maintained and laid out. There is a wide variety of beautiful and interesting marine life. The information is well curated and easily accessible.All in all, it was a really good morning out, I would recommend it to any tourist or local looking for something to do in Cape Town on an overcast day."

The Wharf warrants a visit on its own due to its multitude of activities including shopping, eating, and day tours. The Two Oceans Aquarium is a relatively small, but well done aquarium. You will see species from the two oceans (Atlantic and Indian) that South Africa's position offers. The exhibits are well done, clean, and well labeled with countless volunteers able to help you to both navigate and give you information on the animals (that range from Mantis Shrimp and Penguins, to small sharks and large predatory fish. There is a large tank near the center of the aquarium where you will find sharks, large fish, sting rays, and the like. Definitely worth the visit if you enjoy aquariums, and especially if you have children. If you want to get up close an personal, you can also dive with the sharks in the tank, however I would recommend you take the Great White tours that you can find on the Wharf. Entrance fee is relatively cheap and the gift store is well stocked."

Daniel has never tired of looking at the exhibitions which he has been going to since he was 2 years old. When i visited with them, he gave me a guided tour, pointing out the huge crabs, the frogs, the sharks, the sea-horses, the very poisonous Stone fish and the rays, who slide up the glass and smile at you! And we always end the excursion with a stop at the shop for a souvenir of another delightful, educational day out."

There is a great deal of building work underway at present to add bigger and better exhibits in the coming months.The adjoining Shoreline Cafe is a great stopover point afterwards for a light snack.Always a popular family favourite - the only thing about the Aquarium I am not so fond of is the pricey entrance fees."

I pointed out that the ink had run out, and was then informed by the man that it was invisible ink! My girlfriend also told me that most of the clubs in SA stamp your hand with invisible ink as well. But anyway, the aquarium...!First up we saw some children standing up inside a vertical tank full of 'Nemo' fish, next to another tank with a couple of massive eels. Further through, highlights included touching starfish and anenomes, seeing the penguins, the kelp tank, the carnivorous fish tank (including two sharks and a bunch of some of the ugliest fish around, a pitch black angler fish, giant spider crabs, and some beautiful drawings and posters about whales.At one point we turned a corner, fully expecting to be half way through the adventure, but instead coming across the little shop at the end. We saw that they're building a new tunnel so that will give people a bit extra to do, but it felt very small and we were expecting a bit more. However, what was there was very good, and the posters and information on the walls added to the experience."

The aquarium displays a wide variety of marine species from both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The aquarium is also homed to 23 African penguins, as well as 9 Rockhopper penguins, who are housed in a beach like exhibit on the upper level of the aquarium. Daily penguin-feed presentations happen at 11.45am and 2.30pm, these are filled with information about the species on exhibit and fun to watch! (attached a photo) The aquarium's I&J Predator exhibit is the largest exhibit and the most popular. Here you can find ragged toothed sharks, a variety of rays, a large school of yellowtail as well as a loggerhead turtle named Yoshi. Other large scale exhibit areas include the Ocean Basket Kelp forest, Indian Ocean Gallery and Atalntic Ocean gallery. Feeding times for the Predator tank is 3pm daily (with sharks being fed only on Sundays at 3pm).If you get hungry and feel like a quick bite! Pop-in to the Shoreline Cafe' located near the entrance of the aquarium. Their Menu caters for all, from adults to kids... and much more! The service is excellent and the prices rational! On a whole my family and I were blown away by the overall cleanliness of the aquarium, friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and fine detail of each exhibit space! Although some find the aquarium small compared to the likes of Ushaka Marine World and other Marine \"Parks\", The Two Oceans Aquarium is a unique experience on its own!Coming Soon! - The aquarium is also currently expanding its exhibit space and building a brand-new Predator Exhibit which should open in March this year! The new exhibit will have a 180degree-viewing tunnel and will display a larger variety of sharks, rays and fish found off the coast of Southern Africa!!"

I'm no nature scientist but I know for a fact that the exhibit was not suitable for the animals and they all stood looking miserable. The heat in there was absolutely rediculous too. Another is the shark tank. The tank was like a roundabout and the Sharks barely swam around, more like they floated as if they were doped. I don't think anyone should go there and invest in there terrible business."

It has set a strategy to provide serious scientific information AND to attract families with young children by ensuring that there are things for them to do. I learned much about minuscule sea life from an interactive station asking for guesses on what was in pots which were then put under a telescope and projected on a screen. Several tanks allow children to crawl underneath and rise in a central bubble making them appear as underwater swimmers. There is a staffed children's play area. Regular animal and fish feeding sessions are another attraction. The sharks and sea turtle are fed only on certain days but the penguins daily.Entrance is not cheap for South Africa but the ticket is a day pass allowing entry and exit as one chooses. There is constant updating of displays and one gets the impression that there is excellent management of the total environment. The cafe has terrace tables on the harbour front or interior seating. Kids are well catered for with a reasonable ice cream and slush drink selection.People say its great for a rainy day but I think it is equally as good when its too hot outside!"

If you buy the year membership a shark dive is about 50 USD, which is cheaper than diving many places in the world. It is a really fun experience to have sharks a few feet from you. Petting the aquarium turtle is also a good time. It is a totally different experience to dive in a fish tank than in the ocean, definitely worth a shot.Other than that the aquarium is OK. It is great for kids and families. We actually found the information on the fish and plants to be lacking, but there was lots to see and touch. Check the feeding times ahead of time and try to come and see penguin, shark, or other feedings. The penguin exhibit is good fun as well.

We saw creatures there that I have never seen before. There is a huge variety of marine life although the signage is not always accurate. Some of the exhibits stress the importance of how we need to change if we are to save the planet. We spent a very enjoyable 3 hours there"

The aquarium is really littered with interesting displays. The large tanks are really spectacular. Sharks so close i could start counting teeth! Although not cheap, I honestly believe it is value for money. The yearly tickets also seem to be a steal, and had I lived in Cape Town, I would definitely invest in them. The kiddies area is also entertaining with puppet shows and other activities on offer. You cannot fault this place."

We took our kids ah headed off to a birthday party hosted there which we didnt know you could do. From start to finish our kids enjoyed themselves immensely and were not bored at all. We then all went to the restuarant where a real treat was waiting for the kids. They had lots of fun and were completely exhausted by the time we went home. From the waitresses to the manager were superb in handeling the little ones."

Our visit on a Sunday afternoon coincided with the feeding of the penguins and we found the experience educational and the kids enjoyed it. We also witnessed the feeding of the sharks in the predator exhibition, this was a spectacle watched by a full house at the auditorium as it quite a popular attraction with the rugged tooth sharks, a turtle plus other predator fish species. There are colourful and interesting smaller species of marine life, some that one can never imagine ever existed, which were a revelation to us. The kids also loved the educational frogs puppet show. All in all it is a fun and mind stimulating environment. Awesome space every kid will love (it awakens the kid in everyone of us)"

At the end of every visit, we always end our stay at the craft tables, where we paint whatever canvasses are available. Parents are allowed to paint too! Winters in Cape Town are always a treat at the Aquarium. We like that they are constantly upgrading too. The annual membership also allows us discounted rates to really fun activities organised by the establishment like Halloween parties and breakfast picnics, etc. Definately value for money. For adults, the experience is awesome too. There is nothing like HUGE, majestic sea creatures to keep one in awe of life."

It was really nice for us to see the different aquariums but mostly the big one with the sharks.If you have the opportunity book a Shark Dive; it was an amazing experience though a little bit chilled towards the end; make sure you wear a long sleeve lycra underneath the neoprene if you are used to tropical waters and of course have someone on the other side who can take pictures of you with all the sharks/turtle/stingray around or bring your underwater camera with you during the dive."

It's been there for ages and each time I visit it there's something new. The place is designed to let you stroll around, beneath and into the displays of colourful creatures. I especially enjoyed the orange shrimp in the blue tank, the Nemo's you can pop your head into and the sharks in the whirlpool aquarium. A great extention to your visit would be to catch a sail boat from the Harbour and see South Africa's marine life from another unique angle."

The place was truly magical, so many different types of aquatic life to see & touch, a great experience for kids & grownups alike. Only part that scared me senseless was the shark tank, you see it from afar before getting too close, however to get past it you have to walk under a glass tunnel where they're all swimming by. Thankfully someone held my hand whilst i ran under it with my eyes closed (not a fan of sharks)Price was good for the amount you get to see & not far from the water & lots of good restaurants, certainly worth a visit. Only complaint was that a few of the 'Nemo' fish were dead at the top of the tank, which upset a few kids (poor things)"

They also have things for kids to do like coming up in a middle of a fish tank and it looks like the kids are with the fish. There is also a curio shop & one can swim with the sharks."

I knew it was in process of renovation and extension so expected displays to be a bit lacking. In practice, I ended up spending a wonderful three and a half hours inside. There's much to entertain youngsters, including a Finding Nemo tank with a glass dome in the centre where they can put their heads up and be right among the clown fish. There's also a smashing little automated puppet show on the subject of protecting the habitat of frogs. For adults, much to see; much to photograph. My one disappointment was that the seahorses were missing due to the extension works. A good reason to return when next I visit Cape Town.The Aquarium is also the easiest place to pick up the Tourist hop on-off bus from the waterfront, or there's a car park across the road."

Offering displays from both the Indian (warm) Ocean and the Atlantic (cold) Ocean makes this aquarium unique. Another strength is their child-friendly facility and services. There is a playspace built into the tour, as well as a children's classroom/party space. Very educational and beautiful!"

The predator tank feeding every day at 15:00, sharks are fed on a Sunday - love watching feeding time. The kelp forest is so peaceful you may just be hypnotized by the ocean sway. I love the touchy feely tank where you can hold a starfish, feel an anemone's prickles, see crabs up close and personal all under supervision to keep the animals safe. The microscopic display is fascinating and always gets my attention. The kiddy play area down by the seal tank has all sorts of art and craft activities and puppet shows at different times of the year. When my children were young we went every holiday and never got tired of it. If you become a member you get to have sleep overs in the aquarium with treasure hunts, and all sorts of fun activities. Sleeping by the kelp forest was a highlight for our whole family. Very educational and entertaining. The restaurant's food is nice but I feel strange eating fish after admiring them alive, so I stick to the sandwiches and salads when I eat there."

So instead of just walking around admiring the aquatic displays, you will frequently encounter areas to interact with staff manning a display with something really interesting to share. Whether it is looking into a microscope at plankton or touch and feel of sea cucumbers or watching the feeding of penguins or predators. Take note of feeding times and puppet shows when you enter and make an effort to attend ... you will enjoy."

If you are familiar with the Boston or Baltimore Aquariums, this one is maybe a third of the size. However, they have many fish that we haven't seen before so that was neat. For general viewing it took about an hour.The amazing thing was the penguin experience. 3 times a week, 2 people can spend about an hour with the rock hopper penguins - all for $35 (including Aquarium admission)! We booked this and loved it. My sons went to the roof, sat on the edge of the tank , covered in towels while the penguins jumped on their laps and demanded to be petted. The volunteers that were our guides (Tallia and Kristin) were informative, kind, and enthusiastic. We learned about the penguins while having a once in a life time experience. If you can this it completely worth it!"

Lively fun atmosphere, a lot of comparisons and \"'did you sees ?\" .... children simply got on with being children and the learning educative side aided by the helpful staff, was great. Also a lively puppet show, with entertainment value.Great variety of species endemic to the Cape's colder waters and our more temperate ones too. Then there were those for poisonous value and those simply kalaeidoscopeic colours, the weird, the odd, the beautiful. plenty of choice.I would say that penguins star of the shows, but quite a number of the colourful fish and starfish interesting ... suggest bring a camera and comfortable walking shoes. Allow 2 hours for the visit.Certain degree of nostalgia ... when I grew up a 74, no not the year 1974, but the fish species a 74 was around. sadly no longer, and more to go. Currently there is a myriad of fish, sharks, reptiles, penguins ... 1000's to keep us entranced.On a related note, the aquarium included a wonderful live exhibit including the dire educational elements - weapons of mass destruction - lethal plastic bags, nets, hooks, wires, bottles, to name but a few and the painful death /destruction our selfish behaviour inflicts....

The penguin exhibit is beautiful, but a bit disturbing to watch a couple of penguins trying to get through a barrier to another area. The added frog tanks were interesting. The only low point for me, as an adult, was the puppet show. However, it must be said that my six year old sat quietly through the whole thing, enchanted. And the touch pool needs work - they can certainly take some leads from uShaka on that one for a far more interactive and satisfying experience.

Sadly I couldn't volunteer as I left the country shortly afterwards, but it remains one of my favourite places in Cape Town. The aquarium may be relatively small, but it showcases a stunning variety of sea life from both coasts (West Coast and East Coast, each of which have very different sea life) and, as the name suggests, two different oceans (Atlantic and Indian). The aquarium is very interactive, with a touch pool and microscopes available for guests to explore marine life first-hand. I'd highly recommend buying tickets online in advance,as the lines can get very long in peak season. Check the feeding times if you'd like to see the creatures in action - the penguin feedings and shark feedings are the most popular. The Two Oceans aquarium is very child-friendly, with lots of activities for little ones. The staff are friendly and informative, and there is plenty of information about each exhibit. A great outing for the whole family, couples, or friends. It's also a great indoor visit for rainy/cloudy days!"

Of-course funding is an issue and the facility remains fairly \"static\" but there are new tanks from time to time. My daughter does not mind one little bit and regularly asks to return!

I think the negative reviews need to take into account the size and point of the aquarium. It is rather small, but it also serves a great purpose to educate kids about animals and the environment. South Africa is a special place and the more humans respect their environment the better. So yes, this aquarium is worth a visit. Have an open mind and learn about the local waters and animals!"

This aquarium showcases everything you can find in and near the waters surrounding the Cape.As soon as you enter, you are greeted with a tank of beautiful coloured fish, and a large eel at the bottom !!!! A small turtle seemed to follow me around the tank, and made for some great pictures (see below). Moving on further inside, there are loads of tanks with information placards alongside with information. A nice touch for kids (and big kids!!) is the tank full of clown fish (Nemo\u2019s!!!) where you can crawl under and stick your head up into a \u201cbubble\u201d at the bottom and be surrounded by the fish :-)Luckily, I was there for the penguin feeding (done daily - check times) and talk - very interesting to hear about the penguins from people who work with them on a daily basis, and be able to have a Q+A session during the feeding. Further on and you are confronted with a HUGE glass tank (over 2 storeys high) featuring bigger fish, an awesome turtle (see pics) and sharks!!! Very cool and again, an interesting talk from one of the staff at the aquarium. There is a nice walkway around the massive tank and you can really get up close to view everything - watch out for the porthole windows, as the sharks seem to suddenly appear eye-to eye with you !!!!All in all a very informative trip and I got some great pictures to add to my album :-)Keep up the good work!!!"

It was also very informative and I learnt a few things too. We were lucky enough to watch a real time feeding session where divers drop into the colossal tank and hand feed the mantas and the large turtle, I believe the sharks are fed on Sundays so shame we missed that. There is always plenty to do down at the waterfront but I'd recommend anyone with kids to go to the aquarium, photo opportunities are plentiful and just videoing what's in the the large tank will make for great viewing for years to come. The staff are friendly and welcoming so I'd say it's a given that any family visiting the waterfront should stop by the aquarium for a couple of hours."

I'm now 24 and enjoy it, but a lot of the tanks are very small or have minimal sea life inside. There are large kiddies entertaining areas, but nothing that caters to those who want to know more than the basic details. The exit goes through a gift shop, which is obviously good for sales, but makes the experience feel a bit cheap. As it is located at the Waterfront area, I expected a bit more. Nice to do on a rainy day, but nothing special."

There is ample parking in the parking lots adjacent to the aquarium and the access and facilities are family friendly. You can arrange a scuba dive with the sharks on location, generally needing to provide 24hr notice to secure a booking. You can slot in the aquarium visit during your walk around the waterfront with many other local attractions and shopping malls in close proximity. Very educational experience. Don't forget to take a short boat trip around the harbour to see some of the marine life you saw in the aquarium!"

A lot of tanks are made so that kids can interact with them in one way or another and offers a lot of fun for kids to play around in and look at the stunning fish that are kept here. It's nice to see an aquarium where they have animals that 'belong' in that country. Most animals are either from one of the oceans or are stranded there by accident, like the penguins that they have there. Truly an amazing aquarium, they even have a huge tank with turtles, galjoen and sharks, where you can swim in. We spent well over 2 hours walking there and enjoying the tanks."

            "review": "Diving in the Predator Exhibit. We went to the Aquarium for the sole purpose to dive in their predator exhibit since our blue & mako shark dive was cancelled due to weather. It was extremely inexpensive relative to the same experience opportunity in the States. You could use your own gear or you could rent their gear, which was very clean and well maintained. They had hot shower change rooms to use once you got out. The dive was too short, ~30minutes, as it was fun being so close to the creatures. Surprisingly I found it quite entertaining to wave at the kids and people looking into the aquarium from the outside. Was able to find and keep a few shark teeth from the bottom floor. Got to pet the resident turtle on her shell and back legs. The rays swam right to me and would swim above me right at the last second, making for very good video footage. Swimming with the ragged tooth sharks was pretty cool, but they stayed well above you so I never got a close encounter or even a head on picture of video. Was definitely something to do once in your lifetime if you are a diver. Not sure I'd do it again but glad I did it. I felt very safe and was never worried about anything. We toured the Aquarium after the dive and was very pleased. They had some very exotic critters that I had never seen anywhere before. The penguin exhibit was a bit small, the frog exhibit was a bit misleading as I could only see that they had 2 toads on display, but the variety and health of the underwater critters was good."

We have been to Cape Town with our young daughter 3 times now and have taken her to the Two Oceans Aquarium twice and as she gets older she enjoys it more and more. She is now nearly 5 and asked really intelligent questions and was really interested in the different fish and creatures that she saw in the amazing tanks. It is very child friendly with a petting area, clown fish tank that they can 'step inside' and we were even there for a puppet show in the childrens area. She enjoyed some of the craft activities in this area too. Unlike some aquariums it is never too busy and you can always get a good view of the tanks."

We started off with the restaurant and sat outside with a great view of some marvellous yachts in Cape Town. I had grilled hake and chips for R69.00 which was absolutely delicious. The service was excellent and the staff are well trained and cannot do enough to ensure satisfaction.The aquarium itself is well organised and has some wonderful effects. You can crawl into a tank and find yourself sitting in the middle (protected) of some cute Nimo fish and have a photograph taken by your family. Another interesting fact is viewing various subterranean life forms under a microscope which is projected on a screen and discussed by a very competent instructor. You can have your picture taken with family free and also watch a puppet show. You can watch the penguins being fed and feel and touch seaweed. You can also dive into the tanks with diving gear and swim around with the larger fish. It is a great delight and you can even hold a private event in the aquarium if you like! All in all an excellent venue !and most enjoyable!"

Being expensive it is not too crowded and plenty of things the young and older will be fascinated by. I have learnt a lot about underwater life that I never knew before. There is penguin feeding time and also a play room where kids can paint and draw and are given free materials as well as a large sandpit for the younger ones. Everything here is well supervised. Another more daring room has a steep twisty slide which boys will love and also many toys and leggo type things to model with. An excellent shop and snack bar mean you need not go hungry and the ticket is for the whole day so you can return later perhaps after lunch somewhere else at the waterfront for more viewing."

The passion for conservation is very honourable but risks loosing the attention of the patrons (mostly kids) who really just came to see the adorable penguins enjoy a meal. For sure, use the opportunity to get the conservation message out but short and sweet with a little repetiotion may get more traction.Good value for money. Definitely worth a visit.

I have been to the Two Oceans aquarium about 6 years ago, and although it is smaller than some of the more famous ones around the world, I thought it was a nice day out. This time I decided to do the scuba dive in the shark exhibit (I know you can go Great White cage diving from Cape Town, but I personally don't agree with that environmentally, so decided this would be a good laugh). I am a very experienced diver, but I still found this a very nice experience. Ian the Divemaster made the whole dive easy and fun, and it was great being so close to the Ragged Tooth Sharks, the massive Turtle, and variety of large fish. At times I actually forgot I was in a tank - until you see all the excited school children looking in with amazed grins on their faces!The experience only cost 655 rand, and that also included entry to the other exhibits. I thought this was a great experience (I even found a couple of sharks teeth on the bottom) and well worth a try if you are a certified diver visiting Cape Town."

Many of the exhibits are well-laid out so that you can see the animals from different angles, and the collection is quite interesting. E.g., they have the famous mantis shrimp.The penguin feeding is worth seeing, and one benefit to visiting on Sunday is that you see the shark feeding (it takes place only once a week since the sharks have slow metabolisms).If I recall, the price was about 6 or 8 USD, and it was just as good as aquariums in the US for which you might pay 25 or 30 USD."

It is also great to see how the aquarium is contributing to the environment by reducing carbon footprint, pollution awareness programs and reliance on natural energy sources. Staff were very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful and the restaurant and gift shop were well stocked and not horribly overpriced. Our only complaints with the aquarium were that for the price charged (R108, average national museum fee is R30-60) it was a bit small, we got through it in an hour. Also the layout of the museum itself was a bit counter intuitive for getting around. All in all this should definitely be a place to visit if you are in the cape."

We were there on Christmas Day and it will be a Christmas Day to remember.We are usually traveling on Christmas Day and I try and do something memorable for my kids (ages 12, 17) to remember where they were. The Two Oceans Aquarium had a number of activities that you can book and I organized it in advance of our trip. The one thing I noticed was the great emphasis on what is in the best interest of the animals. For both of the activities that I booked, there was in depth discussion as to whether it was better for us to go in as a family of four, or whether we should be broken down into two groups of two. At all times the staff were thinking of what was best for the animals. Which is the way that it should be!We began with a diving experience in the Predator's Tank. You need to be scuba certified to do this. It was especially fascinating as you go up to the roof of the Aquarium to enter the tank, thus allowing you a peek at the \"behind the scenes\" world of the Aquarium. The dive itself was great with the sharks and turtles. Our dive master gave us extensive briefing on how to conduct ourselves and we felt safe at all times. Afterwards we were given a towel and time to shower.After that we had booked a private session with the rockhopper penguins. Again, there had been extensive communication via email about how many people could be by the penguins, what they would feel comfortable with, etc. I was so impressed with the passion that the Aquarium staff feel towards their charges. The penguin experience was sooo amazing. I smile just thinking about it. The lovely lady who was their trainer was so impassioned about her job and she was excellent at it. She really loved each of those penguins, and so did I after the first 2 minutes. My kids were grinning ear to ear. We had a solid 30 minutes with the penguins and then it was time for the feeding of the other penguin exhibit so we were taken upstairs to view that first hand.While with the rockhoppers, we learnt so much information about the breed and how each penguin had come to be at the Aquarium. We got to touch a couple of the ones who were receptive to contact and were inches away as they got fed.After both our our private tours we took an hour to view the rest of the Aquarium and were very impressed. It is not a large Aquarium but is really well done. The staff are excellent at their jobs and very knowledgable. If I am back in Cape Town I will definitely visit it again - and dive and see the penguins!"

This is a great outing with kids, it is surprisingly small for a aquarium at the ocean , there are no dolphins or open water viewing areas or even seals? It seams the aquarium is the same size as the one at the Pretoria Zoo in the middle of town. There is so much more that can be done and shown to visitors with there direct access to the ocean. For the price per person you would think the aquarium is much bigger and would have more displays"

There is a really interesting exhibit - a tank full of Nemos.We did not have any children with us but it would be a great place for children. The displays and the lighting are really good and create a soothing atmosphere. A good feature of this aquarium is that you can make multiple visits on the same day. We thought the aquarium is a good size as we spent nearly three hours there."

We were there for a good 30-45 min waiting for them to feed the sharks and they only seem to feed the fishes and sea turtles. The Nemos exhibit was fun but due to the Christmastime, the lines were long each time we checked back so we didn't get in for a picture. There is a good playground outside the aquarium the children can burn off some energy after."

In the predator tank, the sharks tend to just circle the top and ignore you although occasionally they pass close by. (You swim along the bottom.) In the reef tank you can feed the fish which is fun. Both were reasonable value for a dive.Aside from that, you can also do a penguin enccounter which looked good. (Booking essential for all the above.)In general, the aquarium has great displays, including a touch pool for kids and a nemo display were you can pop up \"inside\" the tank for a different view. The cafe on the waterfront had good views and nice lunch too."

The displays and exhibits are very well presented and the entire design is well thought out. Many of the exhibits are presented like a picture gallery, except the artwork are glass tanks filled with exotic sea creatures. Many of the exhibits are tailored for children, so it's a must for the kids! If you plan and book ahead, there are close encounters available with the rockhopper penguins. They are very friendly and have loads of personality. The aquarium takes you on a journey through different marine habitats and exhibits an impressive diversity of marine life. As an added bonus, if you have lunch in the cafe outside the aquarium that backs on the harbour's docks, you may be lucky enough to see (an hear) the wild sea lions. The aquarium has built a floating pontoon for the sea lions and often they will bask in the sun and play on it. Me and my partner spend a good hour enjoying fish and chips and watching and listening to the sea lions... got some great pictures too!"

The Two Oceans Aquarium allow up to 3 certified divers per time slot (they have 3 slots in a day \u2013 09h00, 11h00 and 13h00) to dive in either the Predator Tank or the Kelp Forest Tank, and the dive itself lasts around 30 minutes. You can use your own diving kit or rent from the Dive School. You can do your bookings and payments through the Two Oceans Aquarium website.I have visited the Aquarium many times over the years and have always enjoyed the visits; but this is by far the high-point of those trips for me. We had a Loggerhead Turtle who seemed to take a liking to our fins and was very persistent \u2013 much to my delight and the amusement of the visitors watching us. The Ragged Tooth Sharks kept a wary eye on us the entire time \u2013 it was only afterwards that I found out that it was Shark feeding time a few minutes after we finished our dive, so I was somewhat relieved that they saved their appetites for their regular food !! The Rays were very inquisitive and the shoals of other fish were amazing to experience \u201cclose-at-hand\u201d. This is DEFINITELY an experience that I would encourage any certified divers to do."

It was one of the best places I have been in Cape Town. I have never thought I would see plankton or so many varieties of jellyfish! The aquariums are well kept and in some areas there are people explaining about the behavior of some very interesting creatures like microorganisms and sea anemones. You can feed them and touch them! I also really enjoyed the \"Nemo\" aquarium, where you are surrounded by fishes, the different crustaceous and the predator tank with sharks and stingrays. I will definitely go back!"

We visited the Aquarium during a wet morning in August, mainly to keep dry, but also because we've made a habit of visiting similar sites all over the world, from New Zealand to the US. A large number of the displays were familiar from those other visits, but there were some notable exceptions. The exhibit with literally hundreds of clown fish springs to mind, as does the penguin site. However, the major point I'd make is one that has been raised by other contributors - the staff. Every single member of the staff that we met, from the ticket kiosk to the touch pool, was clearly enthusiastic about the centre. Probably our most interesting fifteen minutes was spent in conversation with a charming lady at the micro marine life stand, where she showed us amazing items that were all but invisible to the naked eye. Her enthusiasm was a joy to see.The final point I'd make concerns the attached caf\u00e9. We were staying in the Waterfront Apartments and breakfasted extremely well each morning in the Aquarium's caf\u00e9, eating our fill at very good prices, far cheaper than any other establishments close at hand - and, again, with charming staff, who were eager to please. Thoroughly recommended."

The highlights for us: the predator exhibit (note: sharks are fed on Sundays at 3pm); the Rockhopper penguins (very unusual and great fun to watch); and the \"Nemo tank\", where you can scoot under the tank and take a picture with about a hundred small Nemo's. Very cute. If you get lucky and catch a trainer as we did, they are very friendly and informative.

With amazing precision, she zoomed the microscope in on tiny crustaceans, the smallest of which were reconstituted shrimp (amazing!) used to feed smaller species of fish, and barely visible starfish which were my top pick - no bigger than a match head but so perfectly intricate!

(He loves penguins) The aquarium seems very geared towards children so we didn't really visit many exhibits other than those we passed on the way to the penguins. It looked nice and well maintained with a lot of variety from what we could tell. I highly recommend booking the encounter and it includes admission to the aquarium. . We spent about 30 minutes inside the penguin enclosure and got to hold penguins and help them build their nests by handing them nesting materials. The keeper was with us and was very nice and informative. We had a great time and it was certainly a unique experience! It probably wouldn't be a good idea for young children as the penguins can nip/bite (it doesn't hurt). It is set up so that some family members could watch and others could go in the enclosure. I would say that older children and adults would enjoy this a lot!"

So me and my brother-in-law (both certified divers) jumped at the opportunity. You need to book the dive in advance, so make sure to call ahead or stop by reception in order to book your dive. The dive guide will also be checking your certification card so make sure to bring it on the day of your dive.Our dive at the aquarium began with us signing the usual liability waivers at the front desk. Our dive guide met us at reception and took us on a quick tour of the aquarium. He brought us to the huge tank we would be diving in and talked about the different creatures housed in the aquarium itself. After that, we were off to the staff-only zone! After changing into our bathing suits and gearing up, the dive guide brought us to the top of the aquarium where we would be carefully entering the water. After making sure all of our equipment was working, we entered the water one at a time and made our way to the bottom of the aquarium.The dive itself was about half an hour, but in that time we got the chance to circle the aquarium twice. We were instructed not to touch any of the animals, for obvious reasons, but we were allowed to wave at the other guests staring at us through the glass panes. It was a neat way of experiencing the Two Oceans Aquarium - as part of the exhibit!If you are a certified diver and are in Capetown, I really recommend that you consider diving the aquarium at Two Oceans. You'll get to see many interesting creatures up close and just the experience of looking at people from the other side of the aquarium is a joy on its own! The whole dive was conducted in a very safe and controlled manner so at no time did we ever feel threatened by the sharks or other animals swimming around the tank.This was one of my most memorable dives and I hope this review inspires you to give it a try if you ever get the chance!P.S. The cost of the dive also includes access to the rest of the aquarium after you've completed your dive."

From beginning to end we were entertained and educated. The displays are masterfully put together and some are truly astonishing ... those huge crabs ...The only thing that was a bit annoying was all the push prams. Of course it's to be expected that a place like this will be FULL of little children (be warned, if this is a problem for you!), but the prams take up a lot of space and sometimes you've got to squeeze through to a display area. Nothing aggressive though. Just a bit cramped, but again, to be expected on a Saturday morning. If you've got little children, this is THE place to take them. Many of the displays are geared toward children - they've even got a play/craft area and a puppet show, which was very cute. All in all, a fabulous, fascinating, entertaining morning - we got AMAZING photos here."

The huge circular tank in the center of the Aquarium is full of large white sharks, rays,big yellow fin tuna and some othernlarge fish.Kids and adults that we saw that day where having fun! They have a kids interactive zone that reminded me of the Monterey Bay Sea Aquarium in California.

I expected the place to be bigger, but still was not disappointed, and was able to back-track through the aquarium again to spend more time at the exhibits i enjoyed. I was particularly impressed with the predator exhibit, as well as the penguin floor, since there's no glass between you and the penguins. Some benefits of being at the aquarium so late was that I almost had the place to myself, which was great for taking photos.If you have kids, definitely allot more time here, but if you're alone, i'd say a minimum of 1.5 hrs would be sufficient."

The visitors give a crap about the signs to not touch the rays. Yet, I really liked the information about preservation and also what fish we \" can or should eat\".

It is on par with many med to large city aquariums in what they have on display. They do have many interactive exhibits/talks which is very nice. All the personnel were very well informed and obliging to answer many questions in a friendly and unhurried way. We strolled around for a few hours looking at all the tanks and just happened to stumble upon the ramp up to the PENGUINS! They were awesome, but the signage should be better. Wonder if the people who thought this was small and not so great got up there. We spent a long time looking, then broke away for a lunch in their restaurant. The food was very fresh, a lot of variety for a place like this. Unexpected and great. My daughter and I sat on the outdoor patio at the waterside enjoying our great meal,then re-entered (you get a hand stamp for the whole day) and looked again at our favorites as well as getting to see a couple of their feeding times. All in all a very nice place to be able to spend an afternoon."

This was particularly important, as my Mum used my wheelchair, and I used my electric scooter, whilst Dad and my carer walked!One floor consists entirely of fish (tropical) in tanks, and I spent a lot of time with my camera, There is also one attraction where you can climb up into the fish tank (and stay dry) so that one's head is in the centre of a fish tank!The staff are very knowledgeable and there is another section where one can use microscopes to look in detail at coral, seaside items, tiny planktons, rocks etc. it was obvious the staff really knew their job, and were perfectly willing to answer all sorts of questions.We then went down a ramp to the bottom, where we saw divers go into the tank to feed the various fish, which included Great Whites, tuna, snook, and various other types of fish. One of the divers told us that they feed certain fish on certain days. The fish didn't seem to bother about humans in the pool- they were more interested in the food!Later on, we went up to the penguin pool to watch the Rockhopper Penguins being fed Raw Fish by a female assistant. There were also some black oystercatchers, who live with the penguins quite happily! It is open every day of the year.Lastly, we went to a large trough where an assistant invited tourists to put their hands in water, and take out samples such as seaweed, coral, barnacles etc. She did this herself, and put items into our hands. She then told us about them, and again it was obvious she knew what she was talking about, and was willing to answer questions.One slight grumble, is that although the shop is well stocked, the prices were a bit on the high side, with 400 ZARs being asked for a book, and 140 ZAR's being asked for a set of postcards!However, we enjoyed the morning, and after we had been round the Aquarium, we had our sandwiches outside in the shade!"

As for the sharks they are much smaller than the ones at Usharka and not as menacing. Everything seemed sponsored- like the I and j shark tank. I really likes the work the the aquarium is doing regarding work with community involvement and upliftment, but I really do not see enough negative to convince kids of the harms of plastic killing dolphins, seals and shark. I liked the touch pool for the kids and the anemones that was well done and a good educational tool. I also liked the tongueless toad and the little frog house and show, doesn't have much to do with the sea. Being western cape we should focus on our galjoen ( stunning display) , seals, and sharks and the difference between Raggies and great whites. I am passionate about the sea and was disappointed.

One real benefit of the aquarium is the cafe. we had a terrific lunch there, sitting outside and watching the seals. The open sandwiches served on breadboards (not the pre-made take and go) were very fresh and it was nice to see vegetables in a land of meat. The gelato counter was also welcome on a hot day."

Not only will you see the local sea life (without freezing), but also showcased many of the fish species from the tropical regions. After visiting many aquariums across the world, I can say that this one is just as specatular. Although there is no whale sharks (like in Atlanta), you can come up close and personal with the fantastic raggies (or ragged tooth sharks) in the big sea tank (my personal favourite). The interactive section for the children is my son's favourite. So if you are really desperate to scuba, book a dive in the sea tank. I did this many years ago and still remember it as one of my highlight dives. Checking out people from under the water!!!!

We went there frequently to play in the splash pool, and watch the feeding of the sharks. The kids really enjoyed these trips, but as they got older, nothing changed or enticed them to go. My advice to the Two Oceans Aquarium is to keep the momentum going for the older kids by arranging more activities for the older age categories, or you will keep having to entice new families with young children. This also then makes life much easier for families with very small kids and tweens/ teens to still be part of the Two Oceans family."

Was a bit concerned that flash photography was allowed - it hurt our eyes let alone the fish's. Definitely recommend and don't miss the feeding times - fascinating. It was recommended to us by our super Tour Guides Lisa and Louise at African Trax. Everything they arranged for us was superb and I can't recommend them too highly. They are a two woman band and they deliver a friendly personal service. On our pick up they even took my Grandaughter over the road from the Aquarium to forage for 'precious' stones before driving us to the hotel to pick up our bags and thence onto the airport. Nothing was too much trouble."

Children and adults can learn a lot as also see wonderful sea animals. There is a show in which they feed big fish that is very informative. And they also feed penguins which is a very nice show for kids. And you can take nice pictures there.My only complain: people working there should be more kind to visitors. If you get there with the hip on-hip off bus, remember that you have a discount in your entrance ticket to the Aquarium."

I was lucky enough to have a behind the scene tour of the acquarium with Msa, which was amazing. Again, friendly and informative. Withought his insight, I would have had no idea how much conservation work they do and also how much research they are involved with too. I also had a \"penguin experience\", which was a dream come true, and included a penguin sitting on my lap!!!! They weren't African Penguins, but Rockhoppers, and I got to sit in the enclosure with them for about half an hour. As this was a present I have no idea how much it cost, but however much it was, I would pay for it and do it again. A lovely place to visit. Thank you to the team."

The events are listed on their homepage, around 2/3rds of the way down.  The large tank in the centre full of sharks, rays and the bigger fish (the predator exhibit!) was amazing, and very well designed with several viewing points around the tank, so you can look on the big fish from above, alongside and below. Another favourite was the Clown Fish tank where you could climb underneath and come up inside the tank.  The Two Oceans Aquarium was very well designed and a fun place to explore. There were plenty of interactive opportunities and a huge amount of fish and other aquatic animals. A must see in Cape Town!"

My boyfriend found out that on valentines day each year they have a sit down 3 course set menu dinner served to couples, with tables placed strategically around the aquarium. So, he booked a table for us (I think it was about R250 each), we got a lovely meal (had to buy drinks separately) as well as getting the opportunity to amble through the aquarium without the throngs of other tourists blocking our view. It was a lovely evening and much recommended way to get maximum value for money. <3"

Hilarious, particularly since one of the penguins is named Alan.My amateur photos of the penguins and the brightly-colored tropical fish are a great souvenir. And for those of you who load up on South African handicrafts, their gift shop sells a roomy burlap bag with strong bamboo handles.

Ordinarily to do this you should book prior, however we did not, but the very friendly and helpful staff secured us a spot on the dive with no problems at all. The dive master was really helpful (I didn't know a Scotsman could scuba dive) and made the experience more memorable. We were actually allowed to touch the turtles in the tank and as we went around on the bottom, we fossicked for Sharks teeth and found one!! It was great to SCUBA in South Africa with sharks without fear of being lunch. I guess we get them in Australia as well! The only prerequisite for this is that you must have a SCUBA licence to dive. The rest of the aquarium is fantastic and worth the trip when visiting Cape Town. The location is convenient and is on the waterfront.

We were quite delighted with our experience. There are fish seen within that are only seen off this coast. We happened to be there at feeding time and that was well worth the price of admission. The large crabs that can reach a height of a meter are amazing. The baby loggerhead turtle was a joy to watch being fed. The tanks are spotlessly clean and filled with interesting fish. It is certainly small by comparison to say a Monterey Bay Aquarium but seems to offer a lot of things to occupy small children and adults alike and we enjoyed it very much."

Cons: lack of information/eductation/edutainment for each exhibit, many of the exhibits poorly lit which made the reading of any provided materials difficult, many of the non south african species are a cliche, most disappoint there is a full section about frogs yet only two small frogs in the penguin section (I hope the frog exhibit is under construction!).Besides to photograph the penguins or some south african fish I wouldn't return."

High winds kept us off Table Mountain and high seas kept us from getting on a shark cage boat tour. With no firm plans, the last few days of our South African holiday were looking like a bust until we happened across the hidden gem of the Two Oceans aquarium.The aquarium is a half-day well spent for anyone with kids, but it's fun for adults too and a great opportunity for divers who are PADI Open Water or PADI Advanced Open Water certified. They offer closed-water dives lasting about 30 minutes into their main tank for Open Water certified divers and into their kelp tidal tank for Advanced divers. Even if not everyone in your party is qualified, interacting through the 12 inch thick polycarbonate with your friends is pretty fun. If you're not diving, you'll just need a simple day pass. As the diver, you'll need to call ahead and book a time in advance. As a non-member (you, the traveler) who isn't on a SCUBA holiday with your equipment, you're looking at about R595 for the dive. A bit pricey for 30 minutes of fun, but being up close and personal with the sinister looking (but otherwise harmless) ragged tooth sharks as well as large rays and sea turtles is a real treat. They offer full gear, rooms to change in, and showers for after the fact. Just make sure you bring your certification card or dive log or you won't be able to go!Just outside of the Aquarium is a lovely waterfront area with plenty of shops and restaurants to explore once you've dried off. For the family travelers to the divers to those with a penchant for sea life, Two Oceans Aquarium will not disappoint."

The displays on the ground floor are constantly being changed so that frequent visitors get to see something new every time. They are also very \"child-friendly\" with low viewing windows for them. There is also a \"touch pool\" for those that are more daring - both young and old. The \"kelp forest\" tank is amazing with its variety and almost hypnotic with the huge swaying kelp plants. The predator tank also has a stunning viewing area where one can sit and watch the many varieties of fishes (and somethimes turtles or sunfish) circling the huge rock. All-in-all it is well worth a visit - both for entertainment as well as education."

He had never been to an aquarium before and was totally mezmerized- there are giant aquariums inside where you can come face to face with sharks, turtles, even those fish from Finding Nemo. I brought my parents here, too, and we all enjoyed it- even after living in Boston for a number of years, which boasts an amazing aquarium itself. It's just a five minute walk from the Waterfront, where we were staying, and is especially ideal if you need a rainy-day activity, or anything with the family. And if you can't make it to Simon Town to see penguins, you can see them up close here!"

There are wonderful sections for children (of all ages!) and the \"frog\" area is a terrific interactive learning area. The penguins are wonderful, as usual, and it would be easy to imagine that they know their names and play for the crowd. That area is especially meaningful for those also visiting thenatural penguin colony at Boulders Beach, which is on most Cape tours. The signage is in English and I believe there are \"audio tours\" in several languages, but am not sure. The layout, lighting and information panels are well planned, and it is easy to get around on foot or by wheel chair. I'm sure we missed several aspects, and will be sure to visit again if we return to Cape Town. I can imagine sitting in the \"shark\" pool indoor amphitheatre and just \"being\" with the action among the many fish and others who share the large tank with easy viewing advantage from a number of angles.But we did not miss the wonderful selection of gelato in the cafe inside the entrance and enjoyed them with the view of the waterfront.

It showcases the diverse of marine life found in these two oceans.There are over 3000 living sea animals, including sharks, fishes, seals, turtles and penguins in this underwater nature reserve. It is an impressive place. On the higher floor you will see penguins, although they are better in Boulder's bay. The various sharks are a must see.There are demonstration for children, an activity area for kids and note the Aquarium had active volunteers who impart knowledge and take part in demonstrations.A highlight is the kelp forest, one of the longest surviving kelp forest exhibits. There is only one other which is based in California. We liked the fish that seemed to resemble Mick Jagger!"
