Some visitors may be disappointed by the number of 'replica' items on display, but it doesn't really detract from the purpose of a chronological history. Nicely laid out and perspectives are balanced enough that it doesn't feel like propaganda."

Probably do with a little less static display but that's no big issue.\nOverall, recommended."

Visited the Museum because the weather outside was awfully wet - it was a bit of a trek to get from the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR, but once in the Museum I easily spent 2 hours wandering! Entry on the Wednesday day was free and the exhibits are very interesting and I was glad I made the effort! A lack of time prevented me from viewing the Science Museum as well! "

Went to the HK Museum of History on a recent visit to HK, my intentions were to go for a walk and get out of the heat and humidity of the day. I ended up really enjoying the museum as it has excellent displays of HK's both natural and cultural history. I also happened to go there on a day when the admission was free, so an added bonus. Exhibits, short films and overviews are in English as well as Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) character."

This must be the 3rd time I visited this museum, which for a small town like Hong Kong is a good testament to a will to demonstrate the island city's determination to maintain a place of its unique history in modern China, as well as its special position as an ex-British colony.Upon entering the museum, one would be firstly given a glimpse of the pre-historic world when the earth was young. An introduction to basic geology & specifically how this tiny piece of land came into being, including variety of rocks & special geological formations found over the years since the British took over this piece of barren land from a declining Qing Empire in late 19th century and turned it into s crown jewel of it's own.With the background stage set, more detail lessons are presented in chronological order of how the small British enclave developed itself into one of the so-called \"4 small dragons\" in Asia (economically speaking), especially so after the 2nd World War which brought in capitals, merchants & skills like no other times in Chinese history.While the more recent history may be more subdued or even plain, especially so after the return of Hong Kong to China, this museum is still a good place to start if one is interested to know how such a tiny place could have such a big impact on China's history, if not the world."

Well lit and designed displays are on two floors plus a mezzanine, with excellent didactics in Chinese and English. Several short films are shown in small theaters throughout the exhibits.

Many wonderful, lively displays, covering the many facets of the island's history. How the British came and bullied the Qing government into the cessation of HK for over 150 years. Pre and post-war depictions of her people, the handover back to the Chinese in 1997, and much more. Great way to spend the day. Oh, and it's free :)Definitely recommend."

This is one of the best museums of its type that I have visited - and I've visited many! - covering the history of Hong Kong from prehistoric times through to the handback from Britain to China.There was no admission charge on the Thursday that I visited and although I paid the HKD 10 for an audio guide it wasn't really necessary as the English descriptions were so good. There are numerous short films to watch which are extremely informative - the showings in Cantonese have English sub-titles and vice versa, so no need to wait for the English versions.I learned so much, and the museum is thoughtfully laid out and easy to follow - and comparatively empty on the day I visited. I'd intended to pop in for an hour and ended up spending 3.5 hours there - I think this says it all!"

After attending Sunday mass at Rosary Church (Chatham Road), I decided to cross the street and visit the HK Museum of History.At exactly 10AM, the museum opened and there were already several people lining up. Inside the museum, there are several sections starting from how the Hong Kong Island were formed, the earlier settlers, dynasties,trade and commerce, culture, wars and revolution, etc. I've visited Hong Kong several times and this museum visit gave me a better perspective about the country.The admission is free, and it's best to allocate at least 3 hours to go through the museum. It can become confusing as you go through the different sections, but just follow the numbers and you should be good. They also allow free picture taking (which is what I did), and there are small cinemas per section which shows video documentaries.The museum is air conditioned, well maintained and there are even time slots where you can have a tour guide to go through the entire museum. It's absolutely a must visit place when travelling to Hong Kong. It's also beside the science museum, which I'm going to visit next time."

Wonderful mixture of genuine objets, videos, interactive VDUs and high-quality convincing models. This gave it something for visitors of ALL ages. The building itself was very functional. It's just the right size for a family to cover in its entirety within a day, with an easy and natural route around. There are plenty of rest areas and toilets conveniently placed - even the cafe is positioned for a timely break halfway through the exhibits. My only criticism, if I had to find one, was that the final exhibits covering the transition of HK from GB to China seemed a bit too 2-dimensional for young children to notice or appreciate (especially compared to the rest of the museum)."

Exhibits are super (a complete boat-dweller's boat - back- and font-stage of a Cantonese opera - a recostructed village house) and will appeal to older children as much as to parents. The whole visit needs at least two hours, but as it is free I recommend shorter visits on consecutive days. A really great experience."

You enter and then take stairs down to the exhibit and then leave on the ground floor, you don't have to go back up.In Honk Kong cars drive on the left side, so people walk on the left side and so entrances to exhibits are on the left side. I ended up going into them on the right hand side and worked my way backwards. I did not have orientation problem on the first exhibit, but once you get arrows pointing you to the different exhibits, don't go the wrong way!There is an exhibit covering the various Chinese dynasties, but of course I was disoriented about the narrative Nonetheless what I did absorb was pretty cool."

It is a short walk up Glanville street then R to arrive at museum. Next door is the Science Museum, but it is closed on Thursdays. There were several school groups there lining up, but this did not spoil our visit. I really learned a lot about the history of Hong Kong, especially in regards to trade and politics and war. There are short movies all around the museum which bring the history to life, and even if the English version is not running straight away you can read subtitles on the Chinese version if you don't want to wait.We ran out of steam to do justice to downstairs with its prehistory and folk culture- jjust whizzed through.We had lunch at the cafe of wonton soup, Chinese greens in hoisin sauce and drink for 45 HKD each. Good value, although I did not enjoy the flavour of the soup much.Really informative museum."

Everything about this museum is beautiful, smart, and genuinely interesting.

The second floor is devoted to the British side of history and after, which eventually leads to a wonderful exhibition about later 20th century HK. The museum is laid out perfectly, and signs are everywhere suggesting the best route to take to see everything. The artifacts/settings/pieces throughout the museum were thoughtfully picked out and beautifully displayed. They have entire settings on old British post offices, houses, tea shops, etc. which bring an abundance of life to this museum. Did I mention it was free?

Given this was our last day in HK, we traded our intended trip to Soho with longer stay here.We breezed through section 1 and 2, and focused our time on the Hong Kong history. Section 3 and 4 were wonderful, displaying the past HK culture. Section 5 to 8 mostly depicts the political evolutions from the past to the recent events. There were not many visitors, it was a change of pace from the crowd in TST and central. The information was presented in a chronological order, very easy to navigate and connecting the dots.

We (two adults, no children) spent an hour checking out different historical sections - watching some short films (6 - 8 mins long) and generally enjoying a vastly different 'museum' to what we are used to.There were plenty - lots - of children, but all under control, and not a distraction.People say that it should be your first stop - and perhaps that's true with children - but either way, if you are on the Kowloon side of town, absolutely stop for an hour or two and enjoy the Hong Kong history."

My personal favourite was a mock up of an old street, complete with a variety of period appropriate shops and buildings. Be warned that the exhibition space can, at times, be so vast that you can get slightly lost and miss out entire sections of the exhibition.There is another temporary exhibition space, when we visited it was hosting an exhibition on Pompeii.

As to the history of Hong Kong we start 400 million years in the past and follow an amazing history of flora, fauna, land and ultimately man. It was great fun, and left all questions about Hong Kong's place in history. Considering its relationship to China, the western traders, English ultimate sovereignty, the Japanese capture, back to England and its unique existence in China again today, I left finally understanding Hong Kong and its place in history. Yes, it's worth a visit. There's a great gift store and restaurants so you won't starve or be able to leave empty handed!"

Everything is presented in a very attractive way, not a boring museum, more like a story teller. My favorite part is the old Hong Kong culture and tradition, from a fisherman village to a modern city. You could definitely get to know more about Hong Kong after the visit.Nevertheless, the permanent exhibitions are opened to all free of charge starting from 1 Aug 2016.

For $10 (skip the current Pompeii exhibit if you've already been to one) you get to spend around two hours walking through Hong Kong's history from prehistoric to present. The exhibition follows a very clear path which sees you wind your way through lots of recreated scenes from Hong Kong's past - there's an old fishing boat to climb aboard, houses from the 1600s to peak into, and a particularly good recreation of a Hong Kong street in the 1800s under the British Empire. The information is there if you want to read it, but really it's fun to just see and experience.There is a caf\u00e9 and toilets at the halfway point should you need them, and the shop offers an interesting range of items for potential souvenirs. If you're interested, there are tours in English at various points throughout the day - check for times."

We made a huge circle around the whole building just trying to find the rather unassuming entrance. The lobby looks rather dreary, though it's bustling with activity. The ticket is a great deal, just HK$10 per person, including the temporary exhibition, which was about Pompeii. The permanent exhibition \"Story of Hong Kong\" was excellent. Though Hong Kong has perhaps not the most glamorous history in the world, they present their story very nicely, but at the same time not \"dumbing it down\", like some museums do. They began with talking about Hong Kong's geology and the natural environment. Especially impressive were large dioramas showing you the various plants and animals in Hong Kong: educational, yet engaging for all ages. Then they move on to the first prehistoric settlers, and then Hong Kong during Imperial Chinese rule. After that, you go up two floors on the escalator for more galleries, beginning with the Opium Wars and the start of British rule, and ending with a film of the 1997 handover ceremony. The museum is very well organized, with a numerical sequence to each of the galleries and clearly marked signs. While some places were very crowded (with school groups), towards the end of the exhibition there was hardly anyone to be seen, and was quite peaceful.The actual historic artifacts are not very impressive (just some pottery, weapons, functional items, etc.). But their reproduction displays immerse you in every time period, from inside an ancient tomb discovered in Hong Kong, to a reproduction merchant boat from early British rule, to nostalgic replicas of 1960s-era homes and businesses in Hong Kong. Rather than being a display area for historical items, everything's presented very much like a narrative. It's not the \"Gallery of Hong Kong\", but the \"Story of Hong Kong\". And while some \"living history museums\" may end up oversimplifying things or making things way too corny, this museum does it unpretentiously, with informative description placards and actual films from each time period playing in the galleries to retain authenticity.After going out for lunch, we returned to visit the special exhibit, which was about Pompeii and the Roman navy. Once again, the actual items on display were rather unimpressive, but it makes up for it through engaging films and reproduction displays to create an immersive atmosphere. An 8-minute 3D film showed a computer simulation of Pompeii's demise, hour by hour. There was no narration, which somehow just made it all the more frightening. We didn't expect to spend very long, but we stayed well into the afternoon. This museum is easily a whole day activity, and for just HK$10 per person, extremely worth it! A trip to Hong Kong is not worth it without visiting this museum."

After being disappointed by a number of subpar museums in Hong Kong, I was impressed by how great the musuem of history was!The Hong Kong Museum of History is one of my favorite places to go in Hong Kong! For a low admission price of $10 ($5 for seniors), you can easily kill a few hours seeing displays and reading the rich history of Hong Kong. You start off the museum by seeing the geological side of Hong Kong. Including animals that used to live here and how prehistoric people used to live. As you go through the museum, you pass by the eras such as the Kowloon Walled City, Hakka villages, wedding traditions, Cheung Chau bun festival, through when the British took over, as well as when the Japanese took over during World War 2. Finishing up with when China took back Hong Kong and how people used to live in the 70s, 80s and to date. I'm greatly impressed by how detailed this museum was. Not only do they have displays, but they actually have a replica old street you can walk through to live like the old days. Personally I think the most interesting part was when the Japanese took over. It's something you don't hear much of. Seeing how Hong Kong looked like back when the British was in charge was pretty cool too.Overall this is easily the best museum in Hong Kong locals and visitors can both enjoy! It's also conveniently located by east Tsim Sha Tsui. If heading there by MTR, the closest way is to Jordan station Austin road exit."

There is no need for the audio guide which costs HKD10 as the displays have clear information. The dioramas are beautifully executed and tell the story of HK from prehistoric times to early settlers to the Opium War and cession to UK through to the Japanese Occupation and return to China. In between are the folk traditions and shops and enterprises that constitute what is quintessentially HK. 8 galleries over 2 floors. Cafe is open with reasonably priced food."

It's about a 10 minute walk from the TST metro station.The museum is nice and seems well maintained. I got the audio guide since someone here recommended it, but honestly I think you're better off with just the signs. The audio guide basically says the same thing as them, along with some other mundane information about what you're looking at (this is a terracotta pot, 25 cm tall and 15 cm wide). Boring.I wish I'd left more time for the areas on the regions tribal ancestry and ceremonies, and WWII stuff upstairs.I learned a lot, which is the point of the museum so I would recommend this to others!"

The Museum also brought exhibits of the three main groups of indigineus people , their cultures etc. Sometimes the younger generation should learn rather than glued to their smart phones or tablets.

Maybe we were wrong for bringing a child with us to a history museum; but for the most part I thought she was well-behaved. The one time she started crying, I quickly removed myself from a video we were all watching. In the process, I was \"shooshed\" excessively by some of the workers even after we had retreated to the bathroom and stairway area. They actually followed me out there to continue reminding me that I had to quiet her down. Yes, yes, I am doing what I can to get my 19 month old to stop crying... But I can't exactly reason with her, can I? We were also reprimanded for putting her on my shoulders to carry her and told we had to take her down immediately, so heads up if you engage in this form of \"horseplay\".At the end of the day, the museum information was good, the AC was cold, and the communications network between the museum workers was on point.

You start at basement level in the prehistoric age and there are lots of bits of pottery and displays on fauna and flora which are interesting but I spent far too long here and therefore missed out on the upper floors of the museum which are far more interesting and include a reproduction of an old HK street with the shops you would expect to find plus a tea house on 2 storeys as well as lots about the Chinese Theatre and huge colourful procession floats. The modern history which is probably the most interesting in many ways is left till last. I had only 1.5 hours and could have done with 3 so next time I will work in reverse."

I really did not know much about the history of the area and am not deeply interested in history and so this colorful overview was perfect. It was also interesting seeing the history presented from a different viewpoint from the sympathetic to the English viewpoint I was given as a child. Other reviewers have said that it is a superficial point of view and that is probably fair, however I thought that it was well pitched towards families and visitors on holiday."

I missed some guidance on the timeline and some more detail. Same goes for The Dynasties section. I felt like the it is taken for granted that the visitors know their Chinese history. Some more guidance would be beneficial for the ignorant westerner, like myself. :)If you're limited on time, I would start in SECTION 4, from the folk culture.

Than you progress through many different eras - Chinese dynasties, the Japanese occupation, post WW2 boom and the \"one nation, two economies\" after the British turned HK over to mainland China. Some of the exhibits document a lifestyle that has passed by preserving the \"look of the room\", others have film clips. We learned a lot about HK, such as the strange opium wars, where the Brits attacked China to force open markets for opium!

This place is huge, with tons to see and many very large, detailed exhibits, taking you from the very first inhabitants of the Hong Kong area and it's geography, up to the present day, with major points in history being explained sch as the Japanese and British occupations. The museum is broken into 8 sections and there are signs that show you in which direction each portion lies, and also shows you a recommended starting point which is nice. Be sure to check out whatever specialty exhibit is on at the time as well. You'll spend at least a couple hours here, if not more, depending on how many of the movies you want to watch and how much information you choose to read. Even without reading much, certain areas are so detailed you'll catch yourself starting at exhibits for a long time taking it all in."

The second one was their special exhibit but living in mainland China, I had already seen many things relating to the Ming Dynasty and I was in Hong Kong and wanted to know more about it. This was a fun, interesting way of looking at it and only 10HKD which was BY FAR the cheapest thing I did my entire stay in Hong Kong. It took me over 3 hours to properly see everything. There were a total of 8 galleries in this exhibit and all had authentic items, replicas, and a video theater. Again, loved it."

The relationship to Europe, Britain, China. The different settlements. The links to second world war and the Japanese invasion and the role as a rising good producer in the mid 20th century and onwards and how it became a financial focal point. So, a visit to the History Museum seemed like the best bet. And it did\u00b4t let us down. Comprehensive and well illustrated. Nothing spectacular, really, as many history museums are good these days, but a good job by the curators and an appreciable amount of movies accompanying the different \"chapters\" to make getting through the exhibits easier. We came just as approx. 150 schoolchildren did a museum visit. They were so well behaved, though, so it was just a positive and enjoyable extra addition to the visit."

You will most definitely leave with a much greater understanding of Hong Kong historically, culturally and geographically. The main Hong Kong history exhibit covers two floors and has eight sections, so try not to get too bogged down in the prehistory (unless it's your thing). You may have museum burn out before you get to the really interesting periods. Finally, don't forget to check in on the rotating exhibits. They often have great collections of painting and photography borrowed from other museums."

They have an excellent display that shows the development of HK from pre-historic times to the present day with the various ages dealt with in separate galleries.Entrance was $5.00 each for age concessions (\u00a30.46) and another $10.00 for the audio tour (\u00a30.92). The galleries covering the 1700 to present day I found the most interesting and a bit of an eye opener with respect to the Opium Wars and the Japanese occupation. We whiled away a couple of hours here including a very reasonable cup of coffee. If you have some spare time this is an excellent attraction."

Of course, being an avid history geek, I really enjoyed how they broke down Hong Kong's history into periods and designed all the areas with a great attention to detail. You won't find museums that actually let you inside the displays and have life-size models of structures (Tip: Watch out for the 10-meter Bun Tower!). Take two to three hours in this amazing place.

It was free to get in, but I paid the $10HKD to get the audio tour headset. I spent over four hours walking and learning, going to all of the interactive exhibits I found. This is a great afternoon, especially in adverse weather conditions. I think it would be fun for a family as well."

My adult son and I thought we'd probably spend about 2 hours here but we found the exhibits so captivating that we ended up staying well over 3 hours.The museum traces the history of Hong Kong right from the prehistoric periods, through the various Chinese dynasties, then colonialisation, Opium Wars, Japanese occupation and right through to the 'hand over' to the PRC.The exhibits are delightfully constructed and always interesting especially those devoted to HK's modern history.Totally recommended if you have an interest in HK's evolution from humble fishing village to global center."

We were glad we did so since that made us check out alternative plans such as visiting the HK Museum of History. It was a coincidence that admission to all museums in HK is free for the whole of January.The HK Story exhibition is an excellent exhibition. There was so much information presented on how Hong Kong evolved from the prehistoric times until now, in various aspects such as geology, World War, entertainment, politics, people, and culture. It is clear that no expense or effort has been spared in putting together this exhibition. Many props and fittings have been painstakingly designed and put together to make it as interactive and easy to understand as possible. We could almost feel like we were transported back to those times.When we were hungry, there was an in-house HK style tea restaurant that served up bowls of very excellent wanton noodles. The toilets are very clean too. I was quite impressed with the cleanliness of the toilets.While we did not have time to check out the Science Museum, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Museum of History. We have learnt so much about the history of Hong Kong. This visit was the highlight of our trip to Hong Kong.Great job!"

If you have time, go back to see the prehistoric stuff and info on Chinese clans, but you may find you want to spend too long in the first floor fascinating areas. Highlights are reconstructed tea shops, film shows with 1930s British views on life in Hong Kong, a boat which was lived in year round by the boat people, a general store, an opera theatre, puppets ,wedding ceremonies etc etc. it is really well done- and best of all - it is FREE.

They've gone to a great deal of effort with the displays creating walk-through replicas of places rather than just items behind glass. The most interesting part for me was the (relatively) modern history...the opium wars and the cession of HK, Japanese occupation and the development of modern Hong Kong. There are several full size streetscapes and alley ways with traditional shops that you can walk through, and also one of the original Hong Kong trams (yes kids you can climb aboard!). For a child of the 1960s and 1970s it was also great to see some examples of Hong Kong's manufacturing from that period particularly the old tin and plastic toys and household wares, sold in their millions to the west. A great place to visit and very cheap admission. It's also right next door to the Hong Kong Science Museum so you could do both in one day."

This museum did an excellent job on all the photos and displays showing what Hong Kong was and the current time. The admission was $ 10 Hk dollar ( $1.25 US ),it is dirt cheap even you needs to pat to get in ( allow 2-3 hrs for the visit )."

Good use of the space and multi-media makes this an enjoyable experience too.

Lots of on hand exhibits also make this suitable for children, especially on a hot day, or rainy outside. And if they are not done yet, then the Science Museum is just across the walkway. In a place like HK when temperature can be over 30 degree and thousands of people milling around you, this makes for a good break without feeling you are not using your time in HK widely."

The main display here is \"The Hong Kong Story\" which covers the emergence of Hong Kong, through natural environment, folk culture and historical development. The display is executed with aplomb. Theatres have shows covering everything from how the land became as it is, to the deprivations suffered during the Japanese occupation. We relived the British departure from the area, but also see displays on tradition opera, puppetry, processions and bun-towers (you need to see the display to understand). A life-sized street of shops complete with tram further told the story. We learnt a lot across a three-hour visit and then retired to the cafe for a meal. Here, too, was a surprise: it is run by an organisation offering jobs to the disadvantaged. Highly recommended."

There are signs on the pedestrian street once or twice whilst walking towards the museum. We visited the museum on Sunday and it was not packed; surprisingly. On the other hand, the museum is very spacious and designed in a way that maybe you don't feel very packed even if the people flow is big.There is a small nominal entrance fee.Explains a wide variety of Honk Kong history starting from 400 millions years ago all the way up to transfer of Hong Kong from The UK to China."

The museum is very informative and well-laid out. The museum covered the history of Hong Kong from prehistoric times to 1997.There weren\u2019t too many hands-on displays for children but there were many life-sized models of various items. All the displays had signs in English. The museum is definitely worth a visit to learn about the history of Hong Kong.It\u2019s best to combine the visit to the Hong Kong Museum of History with the nearby Hong Kong Science Museum.

We visited, planning to spend an hour or so there, but were there for an entire afternoon.

We dropped into this place while we were walking on the Jordan path toward Hong Kong cultural center and the Avenue of Stars. On that day the museum offered free entry to every visitor. It took us few hours to explore thee floors of rich and intersting stories of Hong Kong from ancient to modern times. This is the place worth to explore before visiting other places, to appreciate Hong Kong people's culture, custom and ways of life. Staff are welcoming and all exhibitions are well organise. You will be amaze and surprise of your discovery and it may help your stay in Hong kong more enjoyable. There are many significant historical items on display and most of them include English narratives. If you are tired of browsing and moving around, drop into the well set up theatres which show a wide range of interesting short films. Must watch at least one of colourful traditional shows! After this visit you may want to refresh yourself by trying local famous snacks, noodle and drinks at 'Sam Gor Mixian' restaurant, located in front of the museum around 300m on the right. If you stay in Kowloon this place is easy access by subway and/or walking."

It must be an interesting challenge to be a museum curator in a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, but the challenge has been surmounted here. About the only sign of any 'corporate' issue was that the same information board can be seen in more than one museum.The museum covers several millenia; with only limited time at my disposal I jumped the pre-historic section and the Dynasties (I had been in the PRC earlier this year). What I was particularly interested in was the history of the development of Hong Kong and the last 170 years or so.This was well recounted, although to be honest not quite as comprehensively as the museum in the base of the Television Tower in Shanghai (but to be fair, that does have the advantage of only covering Shanghai's recent history and not trying to cover as much as this museum).Various rooms were re-created and political, commercial and social history explained, usually accurately. (That said, I do hope that they have taken note of my comments and replaced the Union Flag at the stern of a model harbour vessel with the red ensign shown in the picture on the wall behind the vessel).The potentially sensitive area of the creation of the SAR was well handled.With an entry fee of only $HK10 I thought this cheap enough, but the price is halved for anyone over the age of 60, so amounting to about 50 pence in UK money.A lot of 'buses run past the museum, although I was within walking distance from the United Services Recreation Club (which regrettably TripAdvisor declines to list)."

Particularly good for me are the replicas of the 1970s-style tea house and convenience stores. The attention to detail is very nice to see.Very much worth a look, you won't be disappointed."

Inside we walk across the wooden bridge above the 19th century lanes . It strats with the historical geography/geology of the area ,explaining through interactive display in several langages ...so it goes from the early human settlement to nowadays .houses,trades,fashions,documents....Worth a visit !"

Not much in the way of hands-on activities, so not a good museum for kids under 12 (there is a kids' science museum not even 50 meters away in the building just across from the front lobby, best to take them there). Once you exit the exhibits at the end, there are bathrooms and a small restaurant along with the gift shop closeby. Excellent museum overall, covers the history very well. Of note, usually on Wednesdays admission is free of charge. Check ahead to confirm. A perfect outing for rainy days."

It actually had mock streets with stores, banks etc set up. It touched on the education system and even showed more recent items from the 50-60's. I would offer a suggestion....start at the top floor and work your way down. We started at the bottom which was nice and informative but the top floors have more to see and we had to push to get through everything before they closed. The museum is extensive.Be prepared to spend 2-3 hours of time..it will pass quickly. It has clean restrooms and places to rest along the way and a wonderful store filled with great things about the history of the area."

I really enjoyed looking at pictures and detailed descriptions of Hong Kong's history, before and after becoming a British colony, during the Japanese occupation in WWII and its handover to China in 1997. The whole exhibition even starts from the ancient times before Hong Kong even existed. There were many exhibitions depicting the daily lives of Hong Kongers in the 1950s and 60s. Looking at images from history did not always feel distant--there were pictures that showed people lining up to fetch water during a water crisis \uff08\u5236\u6c34\uff09 in the 1960s--and my dad went through that phase in his childhood when he was asked by his mother to go get water. So going through these exhibitions felt really personal to me.There were also a lot of replica old ships, cars, trams, Chinese medicine shops, post offices and etc on display. There was also one section about the time when Hong Kong was opened up as a port after the Opium Wars. I even saw a copy (or original) of the Nanjing Treaty that was signed between China and the UK which conceded Hong Kong to the UK. It felt quite emotional to see these artifacts because I learned about the history during high school and finally got to see things related to this humiliating chapter of Chinese/Hong Kong history. There was also a part about the Japanese occupation and a board that indicated \"Japanese occupation of Hong Kong headquarters\" which was placed in front of a Japanese military office in Hong Kong during the occupation. Looking at these artifacts and descriptions of the hardships Hong Kong citizens suffered during the occupation was quite emotional as well. The most significant thing that I've always remembered about the war was that local citizens were confiscated all of their HK money and were forced to convert them into Japanese military money--which became useless after Japan's surrender in 1945. To this day, people in Hong Kong who held these military bank notes still have not gotten their money back. It's been 70 years since WWII and the Japanese have still not completely apologized for their wartime aggressions towards victims in Asia. One must not forget history if one does not want history repeated."

You don't just read about the British occupation of Hong Kong - you walk through the streets as they looked back then. Would definitely recommend this permanent exhibit to anyone who's wondering about Hong Kong's history, e.g. tourists with limited prior knowledge like myself.All descriptions and signage is in English, and the museum appeared to me to be wheelchair friendly. At 10 HKD for entry, it's basically free to enter. Expect to spend a good 2-4 hours in here, all depending on how much you decide to delve into or skim through. Also expect a somewhat onesided take on some historical events, but as long as you are aware that you are mainly hearing one side of the story, you will still learn a lot about those parts of the story."

However, from the folk culture, Opium Wars and the Japanese Occupation sections, this is where I was most interested and spent the bulk of my time. Extremely informative and the various video/theatre shows are a great way to soak in the information whilst sitting down (they have English, Cantonese and Mandarin screenings but if you can't wait for the English one, there are subtitles for the other shows). Modern Hong Kong (postwar) section was quite amusing seeing the various plastic products Hong Kong use to make.There was a separate special section which was at an additional cost - not sure how much but I was more than happy just to get the standard ticket for the bargain price of HKD 10 (around GBP 0.80!)Recommend to come early: I came on a Sunday morning around 11am and it was pretty empty (15-20 people max) - when I had finished which was almost 2pm, the queues were building up and tour groups were coming in (which I'm sure would have made for a noisy, crowded and unpleasant experience)."

One gets to see HK's history from prehistoric to modern times. They even have small replica of HK's famous junk and complete with the backdrop of the old HK in the 50s. The kids will enjoy all the collections of artifacts, dioramas, dinosaur bones, painting, replica of old chinese stores, opera, and many others. The place is clean and the rest rooms are immaculately maintained. You may want to bring thin jacket as the place is really cold. This is one place first-time or many-times visitors should go when they visit HK."

I don\u2019t know how the other reviewers got through this museum in two hours; I spent six hours there and had to go back the next day! (A week-long museum pass is only HK$30 and covers \"all museums of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.\" Totally worth it.) If you like museums, allot plenty of time for this one. It starts 400 million years ago and charts Hong Kong\u2019s development to the present. There are videos to watch; interactive multimedia screens that allow users to learn more; rooms set up to simulate traditional festivals and homes or even towns, so you can poke your head into everything from the traditional home of the boat people to a turn-of-the-century grocery store, dressmaker\u2019s shop, post office, and more; dioramas of natural environments and animals native to Hong Kong, along with interesting notes about how the animals have adapted to these environments and whether the animals can be found in HK today; and helpful explanations and fascinating tidbits throughout, in English. The museum also has a nice cafe that\u2019s perfect for an afternoon tea break or reasonably priced lunch, and the gift shop offers an excellent selection of English-language books as well as classier souvenirs than you\u2019ll find at the average market. My only complaints about the museum are that sometimes the intended order of exhibits isn\u2019t clear, and occasionally the museum presumes knowledge of Chinese history. For example, from the Bronze Age it suddenly jumps into the dynasties, with references to people and events that haven\u2019t previously been referenced in the museum. There were also a few places where I wasn\u2019t sure where I was supposed to go next, or where the chronology was muddled. The First and Second Opium Wars are mixed together, for example, and the events are displayed willy-nilly around the room, with references to people and events that might not be explained elsewhere. The introductory video in this room gives a good overview; but even so, it\u2019s difficult to figure out what happened in what order. (I think the outstanding Maritime Museum gives a better explanation of how the Opium Wars came about and what their impact was.) Overall, a great way to spend a day! Highly recommended."

If you can even find the poorly-marked entrance, you will find yourself wondering if the museumis actually open.For museum fans, this might be a disappointment. Although there are many interesting individual exhibits in the museum, it feels like a museum with inadequate funding. Go anywayfor an educational overview of HK history, but don't expect the staff to be responsive or even helpful. You have to leave the museum for a coffee or snack break, which is unfortunate given the sizeand number of the exhibits. It misses the opportunity to bea perfect indoor oasis on a hot day of travelling with family, so it falls short of being user-friendly.The museum shop might be the best part of the visit.

Many of the exhibits were of life-like manner (eg herbal tea shop, grocery shop, barber shop, old street scene, there is even a double-decker tram) You get too see, feel and touch the daily life of the Chinese during the olden days. The exhibitions showcase the natural environment, cultural heritage and historical development of hong kong. There are also small theatres that run short videos. You can easily spend 3 hours or more in here. Highly recommended to visit this museum, specially to the younger generation. Take note museum close on Tuesdays (except public holidays) . Free admission on Wednesdays to the history museum, space museum & Art museum. . Space Museum it's just opposite history museum.One of the way to get to History & Space museum take MTR to Tsim Sha Tsui station, before exiting the station look for the exit point to the history museum. About 10 mins easy walk."

With vivid display of exhibits, the Story of Hong Kong in the History Museum tells you a lot about the evolution of this city in 2-3 hours - from how it was ceded to Britain in the 19th century to its handover back to China. It has displays about many aspects of the traditional Chinese culture, and it also has presentation about how ordinary people lived in this mostly densely populated city in the world. Displays are in life-size models so that you may feel returning to the 60's. (Remember to bring your camera) It is not only for history lovers. It in fact offers a good introduction about the city to any tourist. It should be a good place to start your exploration in Hong Kong. A tip for those with little time - skip the first two galleries. If you are interested in history, start at the 3rd, otherwise, start from the 4th. Here is a link to the official website:http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/History/en_US/web/mh/index.htmlThe museum is located in Tsim Sha Tsui, within walking distance from the MTR stations. A similar display in UK can easily cost you 10 pounds but here the normal entrance is only HK$10. And it is free on Wednesdays!"

I generally avoid History Museums, but after reading the great Trip Adviser reviews for this museum, decided to visit during our recent one-month stay in Hong Kong, and we are so glad that we did. We took our two children with us (5yo and 2yo), and here are our thoughts based on our experiences:* It is a really informative, interesting and unique museum. We had set aside three hours to see the museum, but after two hours we had only seen half of the museum, and the kids were feral, so we decided to cut our loses and leave, which we were very disappointed about, as we (hubby and I) would have loved to have spent much more time there.* The tickets are so incredibly cheap! We went on a Sunday, and there was hardly anyone there. Apparently the Museum is free on Wednesday (please don't quote me on that though!), and gets extremely busy on that day ... I would rather pay such a relatively small amount and have the place to myself!* The Museum itself is very easy to get around with a pram, and all of the employees that we encountered spoke good English, and were incredibly friendly and helpful.* Our kids were too young for this Museum ... which is the case with almost all museums and young kids! The Melbourne Museum that we go to quite frequently has lots of things to engage young children (buttons to press, things to touch, etc), which the Hong Kong Museum doesn't have (not in the first half of the Museum anyway - which is the half that we visited), which meant that our kiddies weren't engaged on any level, hence our hasty departure. If you are travelling without young kids, please make the time to go - it would be particularly great on a rainy / super hot day. If you are travelling with young children, perhaps take some toys to keep them occupied while you take it all in and buy yourself some more time (which we unfortunately didn't think to do)."

The Hong Kong Museum of History is a big museum...not the biggest (the Louvre fills that bill) but the best at telling a compelling, cohesive story that takes one through history. The art, crafts, and cultural artifacts are well-chosen and displayed with care and for impact upon the viewer. The museum is divided into four sections that are seamlessly linked \u2013 prehistoric times, Neolithic times, Dynastic times, and recent times. A mixture of individual items, very well-done dioramas, videos, and articulate and in-depth descriptions does the job. We saw objects from Dynastic times, for example, that are unique among the museums we visited in China. The descriptions are in excellent English (and, I presume, excellent Chinese, be it Cantonese or Mandarin). The presentations on recent times include some impressively large displays from Chinese celebrations, such as the 10-meter-high bun mountain, 3-meter-high effigies of guardian figures, a traditional wedding ceremony, and lion dances. I have never spent as much time continuously marveling in a museum. In China, the Luoyang and Guangzhou museums are larger and interesting in their own right, but the Hong Kong Museum of History provided the most gratifying experience."

I guess the thing that most shocked me was some of the innovative ways in which the information was presented. This is truly a museum for the whole family. With detailed statues and recreations from all the key periods of HK history and theatres dotted around the museum that brings it all together. The videos go on a rotation between Mandarin, Canton and English languages.I have to say, that unlike a lot of museums in the Mainland, it is evident that the curator have utilised a native English speaker to write the descriptions, which makes a massive difference to the overall experience and quality. This is a must see, for anyone interested in more than just selfies of corporate buildings in Central."

So I decided to leave the group to wander on my own. The lighting was dim in some areas and the description of the pieces is placed far from the white borders on the floor, as I tried to lean over in order to read the writing (not stepping over the borders yet), a security guard was quick to tell me off, \"Stand Back!\" This happened 3 times during my 1 hour on my own. I am a frequent museum visitor and know the ettiquetts that one should respect the rules and I do. But these guards apparently they are out sourced to a private security company. These staff are not well trained and they don't even look like a security guard in their uniform. Anyway, I went to Customer Service at the end to lodge a written complain about the bad treatment.It's really too bad because HK needs more cultural activities and exhibitions. We need the people involved to be more friendly and professional without being condescending."

The Museum is spread over 3 floors with escalator and lift access. The exhibits are superbly done, especially the junk and the different living conditions in the Folk Culture Section, bringing history to life and making it easy to understand and enjoyable for all age groups from school kids to pensioners. There are also theatres on the G/F & 2/F Levels which regularly show educational audio visual presentations.I visited on a Wednesday which happened to be Free Entry day, but even on a paid entry day entrance cost is a very cheap HK$10 (that's less than GB\u00a31)!!

The Hong Kong Museum of History is an exceptionally well put together museum which covers the full range of geology, culture, natural history, modern history etc.There are two huge floors and we were running out of time when we made it to the second floor so didnt have enough to time to see the excellent displays of life in Hong Kong in the last centrury through British rule. The section on the Opium Wars, the Second World War and Japanese occupation.are also excellent. Give your self at least three hours here. It's modern, well set out for English speakers and very interesting."

There are different films using historical footage in the small cinemas along the way to reinforce the things happening in the timelines.

The level of detail for the WW2 piece was very good indeed.However I was really disappointed with the lack of content that was provided for the period 1945 - 1996 and made me wonder why?! It appeared that the growth of HK during this period was glossed over with only two or three panels detailing the modern history and development of HK into a major financial center. Then after the handover the level of detail was again very good. Reminds me that the \"owners\" write the history books."

Covers Hong Kong's ecological development, settlement of various groups of people, its relationship with Mainland China, British Colonisation, Japanese invasion, and finally the handover to the PRC in 1997. Although there were disappointingly few artifacts and a lot of photos generally, it was clean, well organised, quiet and good value for the price. However, a lot of the information there could have easily been accessed from the internet, such as the photos and details. Nothing too exciting in terms of seeing too many artifacts from the period's of time. If you are a beginner to Hong Kong's history then you should find this museum of great interest, but for advanced knowledge visitors, it may not be for you."

Although I previously lived in HK for more than 4 years, this was my first visit here with my girls whose Dad is from HK. the exhibits were interesting, colourful (in parts) and provided a good overview of the history of HK. Of interest was the video showing HK during WW2 and during the water rationing period in the 1950s. Its easy to get to (like most places in HK) on the MTR. The special exhibit (for which there is a separate charge) in December 2014 when we were there were the treasures of the Czars. It was a beautiful display of an ostentatious lifestyle and they even brought a real golden carriage there. All in all, if you have a few hours and can tear yourself away from shopping, its worth a visit. There is also an excellent cafe which is charitable in nature (cant remember the name but there are clear signs around the museum) where you can have snacks as well as a full meal."

It was also well equipped with a lot of little theatres, showing short documentary of relevant topics. It was the best HKD10 spend and honestly I am happy to pay more for the value.

There's a section about Hong Kong as a colonial city, donned with beautiful old Hong Kong posters and memorabilia, complete with actual sized shops. In a different section there's some older Hong Kong history pertaining to fishing life and boat people's dwellings. In another section, you'll see life-sized homes and models, displaying Hong Kong village life in the old days.

Near the end of the first floor is a nice exhibit on folklore, and early groups and how they lived. After that, one is directed up two floors and can learn more about the British arrival and occupation of Hong Kong, early days of the city, the Japanese invasion during WW II, postwar and modern Hong Kong of the 60s/70s. For us, as foreigners, the last part of the first floor, and the second floor were most interesting. Worth a visit; Wednesdays are free days."

As I am from Malaysia and we have similar Chinese tradition and culture, I find that most of the information that is gained there is nothing exceptionally new. So we spent less time than other visitors here. as many highlighted the place is big and very informative especially if you are not exposed to Chinese culture before. I enjoyed the short documentaries most.make sure you catch the show of the documentaries at each key sections. I was amazed on how rapidly hong kong has changed. The place is huge so make it your first visit of the day before you starts walking more in the city. It can be exhausting if you have walked in and out of the mtr before coming here.Suggestions to have tickets counter at the entrance instead of the level above. Also the arrangements of the exhibition is a bit confusing as it is not numbered (information cards) I was lost few times finding the right flow. Overall a good introduction to Hong Kong definitely!"

The museum taught me HK history from prehistoric to the present day. You couldn't tell from the outside, but it was quite large. One could really spend over 2-3 hours (or more if you looked at everything) at this museum. Across the way was the Science Museum. That one was equally good. A family could spend all day there. The only drawback was that there was no \"in house\" dining. If they offered old 60's HK style dining there, then this would be a place with \"6 stars\". There was a gift shop at the end of the museum walking tour. It was a well-stocked gift shop with many interesting items. The museums (both the science and this one) were well monitored with staffers to make sure everyone has a good experience. I believe that this museum and the Science Museum across the open space were \"must goes\" if one was in HK with kids. If you don't have kids, just stick with this museum."

We found the overall setting was fantastic. Each era was complimented with true to scale buildings, streetscapes, boats, temples, effigies and these helped create a truly immersive experience. We did gloss over some of the prehistoric sections as we were more interested in the specific Hong Kong history including the Opium Wars and their folk heritage. Given our limited knowledge on Hong Kong we learnt a great deal about it from this museum.The main entrance is located up a wide stairway behind the Hong Kong Science Museum and not from Chatham Road South where a lower level entrance is for disabled access. To visit the caf\u00e9 you have to get a pass from one of the staff members so they can let you back into the museum as the caf\u00e9 can be accessed externally."

This is what a history museum should be - a mix of all-encompassing views and little details presented in a way that allows people to see it all or pick and choose details to dwell on. All for 10 HKD. And with a well-stocked museum shop plus cafeteria (which I didn't try). It's a big museum - there are galleries starting from the geological formation of HK beginning 400 million years ago and going right up to 30 June 1997. The museum presents a history of the city in an interesting, varied and entertaining way. There are plenty of well made films (usually rotating between Mandarin, Cantonese and English, occasionally only single language + subtitles). Comfortable seats ! It's not a high-tech museum - but for history that isn't necessary. It's also reasonably objective - in the sense that it doesn't dwell on the excesses of the dynastic era or the British or Japanese or PRC but merely reports on the key occurrences in as much as they affected HK. (Nor does it directly confront visitors with questions about what they would have done if faced with the circumstances of the time - a style modern history museums in Europe are increasingly adopting). Biggest emphasis is on 20th century. The storyline I missed not having more detail shown was on how opium gradually morphed from the cause of a couple of trade wars (mid 19th century) to a product that could only be enjoyed in 'private premises' (1930s) to being illegal (now). When I visited there was also a temporary exhibit on a St Petersburg imperial palace - this is standard museum quality, OK but not exceptional stuff. Only go if you have a particular interest in Russia."

I spent a Wednesday visiting museums in Hong Kong (the day itself is important because the museums had free entry that day) and I called it the Great Museum Expedition. I visited the Flagstaff House Museum of Teaware, Hong Kong Science Museum, Hong Kong Museum of History, and the Hong Kong Space Museum.Easily one of my favorite museums in history is the Hong Kong Museum of History. Set up differently from most history museums, HK Museum of History starts pre-humanity. It brings you from the formation of the islands themselves, through the dinosaurs who lived in the area, and into the time of British colonialism. The museum's timeline ends in the 1990s, when England \"returned\" Hong Kong to China.My favorite part of the museum was the section about the Chinese minorities who lived in the region. Unlike other history museums I have been to in China, it not only highlights the fashion and differences in the way the minorities look(ed), it also talked about their different celebrations and the cultural differences.If you enjoy museums at all, definitely give this one a chance. I've gotten accustomed to the \"eh\" level of museums in my time in China, but this one definitely hit my Western standards."

There were a few movies to watch. One on geology was very interesting because later that week I saw some of the reference points of that movie and recognized the structures.There were many rooms depicting everything from Chinese opera, pearl divers, festivals, early peoples.

Immediately the atmosphere of the location is calmingly different from the hustle and bustle right across the road. The entrance fee at HK$10 alone is well worth the calm, but it is the story of Hong Kong that it tells that makes this a must-visit. Skip the archaeological bits if short of time and head straight to the colonial and subsequent galleries. It shows the fascinating insight of how HK developed into the frenetic place of commerce and capitalism that it is today. The historical background is, to me at least, fascinating as I often like to appreciate the back-story of the places I visit. The cultural and social anthropological sections captures the colourful nature of the Southern Chinese and their stoic resilience. We followed up with visits, on another day, to two heritage trails that shows the scenes captured in the museum. It was great to see the culture and tradition still alive in the outlying areas of HK away from the incessant shopping districts."

There is an audio tour, written descriptions (in Chinese and English) plus videos (in Putonghua, Cantonese and English). An incredible amount of work has also gone into explaining and experiencing Hong Kong from the fishing villages and salt makers of the past to the festivals of today.

The Museum of History traces HK's history through a series of separate exhibitions each detailing a different era in HK's history.As someone who doesn't like to read a huge amount of detailed information in one go - the way the information was portrayed - with both visual information and short wall panels was perfect for me and kept me interested throughout the exhibition as a whole."

It starts with the geology, animal life, then \"people history\". It is a great overview of the habitation of Hong Kong, with enough recreated streets, shops, waterfront, etc. to both inform and entertain. The cafe is charming and the menu is much more extensive than would normally be expected for a museum. We had a very nice dim sum lunch.

There was a pleasing variety of items to look at, from old pistols and dinnerware to clothing and paintings. A number of slide shows featuring photographs and paintings set the scene; I started to understand where in history each tsar fit. The captions struck the right balance by providing enough information to educate while being short to maintain my interest.The collection of personal items, while not extensive, was a good representation of how they lived. There were some interesting and unusual items such as a matched set of 4 flintlock pistols, in a carrying case with accessories. I'd never before seen the uniform dresses that female royalty wore, so I liked that.I would recommend this exhibit for teens and adults. We brought a 3-year-old and he was bored.

Starting from 400 million years ago until the transition back to China from the UK, the exhibit was very comprehensive. Personally, I enjoyed the later exhibits on the second floor the most.

However, the museum bills itself as showing Hong Kong's history from 400,000,000 years ago to it's re-unification with the rest of China... The last 100 years or so of history aren't referenced at all, perhaps understandably so."

You can easily spend the entire day here looking through it all properly. It is definitely worth a visit and I highly recommend it. We went in the late afternoon so it was quiet and there was a few tours going on.I learnt a lot about Hong Kong and all the cultures etc. My parents tried to explain things to me which were very interesting as they are 'hoklo' and 'hakka' descendants. We saw all the old agriculture tools and my parents were able to explain to me how they were used etc as they were growing up as children when all these farming tools were still in use and are still in use in parts of china.It can be quite confusing to get to, from the mtr station, we went around the long way and it took quite a while to find it, there is a much better shortcut that we found coming out of the museum to the station which only took 5-10minutes walk compared to our 30 minute wonder to find the entrance of the museum. Make sure to check where the entrance is, its on the south side of the museum and the museum is HUGE, it takes up the entire block so depending on which path you take, you can go long way around the entire block or short way around. Also we bought tickets upstairs before going downstairs to the museum itself which is also quite confusing, after we got told off by the security lady for not knowing you have to go upstairs to get a ticket before going inside the museum entrance!!!"

Plus, for the next five or six months, the museum is hosting a remarkable exhibition of portraits, objets d'art, furnishings, and even an imperial coach from Tsarskoye Selo, the Catherine Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia. I found the portraiture, the gowns, the regalia and menus from coronations, and the military uniforms to be remarkably evocative. Thank to the Hong Kong Jockey Club Foundation, which has supported various exhibitions and it the sole sponsor of this one, the objects are shown in a stunning physical installation that evokes the character of the palace. The checkered history of the Russian tsars and tsarinas is told obliquely and well, too, with riveting portraits and personal items of the last tsar and his family.The permanent installation on the ground level covers the history of Hong Kong and the different ethnicities. I concur with other reviews that found the pre-history and geology a bit dull, but the installations for the various ethnic groups are excellent. The afternoon I was there, the place was full of school groups having a great time. Of special interest to me was the exhibit about the Japanese conquest of Hong Kong, their efforts at \"Japonification\" (which assumed everlasting control), and the liberation, which came after more than three years of a brutal regime. This exhibit is very, very well done and merits lingering attention and reflection. By contrast, the Singapore National Museum's similar exhibit, is a bit diffuse and doesn't tell the story of liberation as well. All in all, this is a very fine museum that speaks to many different interests, even Chinese opera and folk festivals."

Though they may not have enough information in certain areas, it still does a good job at explaining how Hong Kong came to be. I recommend it early in your trip, so you can see the relevance and understand the background of the sites you'll see while you are in Hong Kong."

First thing you should know - it takes a long time to visit it properly - give yourself at least 4 hours - 6 or 7 if you are interested in the topic. The museum shows you the history of Hong Kong from the moment of the islands' creation to the modern times. You can see the rocks from which it was formed, the flora, fauna and the first stages of human civilisation. But the later part is the best - you enter the section about Hong Kong's culture and tradition and be ready to stay there for a while - you will see traditional bun towers from the festivals, costumes and items from the traditional opera and wedding ceremonies. But the best are the movies - you can watch all major cultural events - including their annual parades and wedding preparations. Another amazing thing is a replica of the Hong Kong's streets and shops during the British Empire rule, including shops, tea houses and even a healers house - all have props with very interesting descriptions. Sections about WWI and WWII are also very well made. All floors are well presented, information is very detailed and after you finish, you have an impression that you know almost everything about HK. Plus the tickets are dirty cheap. If you like history and museums - this place is a must."

Its a must see if you come to Hong Kong.... gives you such a sense of history of the place, spanning 4million years, but particularly about the last 200 years. In one afternoon, I got a sense of the indigenous peoples of the place, their traditions, the British takeover, the opium wars, and the 20th century history. And because Hong Kong is relatively small, i could relate what i was seeing, watching and reading about to the places I've been every day.Informative, interesting and well-presented.

The Museum of History is a good overview of all things Hong Kong, beginning with its pre-human natural environment and working its way to the present. At a cost of 10HKD (half-price for seniors) and a cool place to hang out, this is a great option during the heat of the day. This is an extensive museum that covers a lot of territory and time, so be aware and pace yourself according to your interests and time. There are dioramas with sound effects that bring the settings to life, and tons of artifacts that date through the ages. There are extended sections on various ethnic groups, including the boat dwellers and salt makers, with recreations and replicas of their ways of life, including a walk-on junk. There are recreations of various festivals, marriage and birth celebrations, the Cantonese opera, parades and lion dances. There are many other replicas of Hong Kong life through the decades, including a Chinese herbal medicine shop, grocery store, post office, bank, tram car, peasant houses, and many others. There are numerous (10) short films (running in English about every third running) that provide further detail, and some exhibits have taped interviews appropriate to the scene. The museum covers the opium wars, the cession from China to England, the world wars, the Japanese occupation, and the return to China. The museum is very interesting and quite well-done for the most part. In some cases, there are too many artifacts too strung out when they could be clustered and organized in time more efficiently. It is often difficult to work your way through in a chronological or logical sequence, but there is a lot of material to cover so you do the best you can. In some cases, the explanatory captions were in too small a print, badly placed at the bottom of an exhibit, or suffered from poor lighting \u2013 we particularly found this frustrating in the case of the ethnic costumes, which were very interesting. Pace yourself and enjoy this very all-encompassing museum."

Was tempted to re-visit just to finish but our time in Hong Kong was far too short to make this possible. I'm not normally into this type of tourist attraction but it had me captivated. Within the museum, they have recreated some of the old style Hong Kong villages which still exist to this day in the mountains and explained the traditions and beliefs that still hold true to this modern day. Extremely fascinating!All museums in Hong Kong are free to get in on Wednesdays but unfortunately we were unable to make it, so went on a Monday instead, only 10 HKD to get in! Blown away. Especially considering the fact that it cost 190 million HKD (if I remember correctly) to build and it's only 10 HKD for your entrance fee. How is this possible! Recommended for tourists and locals alike just to see how Hong Kong has been formed over the years into the insanely busy tourist hub it is today! Worth a visit. I think this is the quietest place in Hong Kong I have ever been, so it may be worth a visit just to see that! Albeit it was a weekday at around 3pm we arrived."

It was $10 HKD per person, which is like $1.25 per person. Exhibits are really well done and informative, but poorly laid out. However, the signs suggest the path you should walk throughout each exhibit. They give a very interesting view of historical events that you may have learned about in US history class, but with a broader perspective since this is the other side of the world. We just loved it and felt like we learned a lot about WWII and the Opium Wars, how Hong Kong came to be, and also other interesting things about Chinese culture and rice cultivating and harvesting.Since this is a government building, it offers free WiFi, which is a nice bonus if you're a tourist and don't have regular phone service here. I loved being able to check my Facebook and get emails.Facilities are nice and clean and overall we had a wonderful experience here. I would highly recommend it for tourists, as it gives you a lot of history and facts about Hong Kong, with beautiful exhibits you can walk through."

In the permanent collection, the museum is laid out in different sections to historically explain what has happened to Hong Kong over the years. \u201cAt first, Hong Kong became a British colony in 1841. Then in 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was signed, formally ending the First Opium War. In 1898, Britain was granted an additional 99 years of rule over Hong Kong under the Second Convention of Peking. In September 1984, after years of negotiations, the British and the Chinese signed a formal agreement approving the 1997 turnover of the island in exchange for a Chinese pledge to preserve Hong Kong's capitalist system. On July 1, 1997, Hong Kong was peaceably handed over to China in a ceremony attended by numerous Chinese and British dignitaries. The chief executive under the new Hong Kong government, Tung Chee Hwa, formulated a policy based upon the concept of \"one country, two systems,\" thus preserving Hong Kong's role as a principal capitalist center in Asia\u201d (reference History Channel). Our Hong Kong local guide told us his personally he would always stay in Hong Kong. It was his home though his brothers have moved out of the country. After the 1997 hand over back to China, there have been subtle changes -- a road that has bus transportation going directly to mainland China, b) cars that have dual license plates \u2013 Hong Kong & mainland China and c) a shift from Cantonese to Mandarin as being the main language. Personally, I know that before the handover those that had monies left Hong Kong to the United States and Canada. In southern California these wealthy Hong Kong residences purchased homes for cash which drastically drove up housing prices. So if you\u2019re into history or are curious about how Hong Kong has been impacted this museum has documented the various aspects and is well worth visiting."

We decided to visit this museum in light of the pouring rain and high temps that have characterized this week for us so far (hope springs eternal that tomorrow will be better!). We went for free (Wednesday) but would have been worth the admission any other day. The museum covers the history of the city from literally the dawn of time to the present day. The prehistoric/natural history stuff was a little hokey - but the legends (in that section and throughout) were still quite informative. The best areas were those that covered the local culture (4 very different settlement groups), day to day life during the British period (the pawn shop, post office, and tea trade exhibits were all great), and the japanese occupation. There was a clear effort to paint the reunification with mainland China as a very positive thing - even though this remains quite controversial outside the walls of the museum. Many of the exhibits are colorful and interspersed with movies depicting the various periods (in multiple languages and with subtitles). One negative was the other patrons seemed to have no space boundaries at all (constant bumping) and who took incessant pictures (lots of kids just snapping pics for the hell of it without even really looking at the exhibit or reading the legend). Still very good place to spend a day and get some longitudinal perspective on a city that is so manic in real time that it's easy to forget all that has come before."

It is worth the $10 HKD to buy the self-guided tour by earphones (this is in addition to the admission of $10 HKD). One problem with this however, is not all of the exhibits are marked with the number on the guide, so we had to look around for some of the items while listening to the guide. The first two sections on prehistoric and early times were not as interesting as section 4 through the end, when the focus was on folk culture. The exhibits on the culture are excellent, showing how they lived in real size and with great detail. It was interesting and flowed well. Lots of bathrooms along the way and helpful guides, and places to rest, to listen to the guide explain the details. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit, and the admission was very reasonable!"

Vast and complicated in its layout, I kept feeling like we were doing it wrong or missing bits. Got very confused by jumping from prehistory to Han dynasty in the space of a ramp and and an iron bowl. First galleries are a bit ubiquitous - geology flora/ fauna without cutting to the chase of what's distinctive about the archipelago. In fact that's the only and meagre criticism I have of this excellent museum throughout- it's a bit wordy and doesn't give you a succinct storyline. It's great to be in a Museum about Chinese peoples that acknowledges and accepts spiritual and cultulral traditions ( in utter contrast to the museum in Tianneman square Beijing. ), distinct tribal/ ethnic groupings within china. these bits were by far and away the best. Watch the video of the opium wars first before doing the exhibits - it's much better than trying to get the narrative from the exhibits. It's horribly even handed toward the British and Europeans ( I'd say this was one of the darkest deeds the Brits have done) especially when the museum dispenses with objectivity with the Japanese invasion 100 yrs later. So it's fascinating to see who is writing the history and who are the beneficiaries of the peculiar political situation that is Hong Kong. Great museum. More going on within it than it's creators intended."

Visitors are drawn into dwellings, places of business or worship and using the many photographs of HK as she has changed, has created one of the most enjoyable museum visits i have experience anywhere in the world. Those who complain that there are not enough original artefacts, perhaps have a point, but do not let that deter you - this museum is ABSOLUTELY worth a long visit.

It is hard to describe the pleasantness of the surprise.This museum is huge for a city history museum, displaying the history of Hong Kong from prehistoric to the present day. To a Westerner like myself, almost all of the information was new, so it was a pleasure to go around the exhibits and read the plaques. And this is where the museum truly shines: the plaques are highly informative and just the right length, with the exhibits they represent being perfect representations of the subject matter.In the museum you will learn about the early clans of Hong Kong, the Opium Wars period, the immigration to Hong Kong, the city in World War II and the development after it, including the massive projects undertaken to bring water and more land to the city.I ended up spending about 4 hours in the museum, instead of the ~1 hour initially planned. You should visit this place too, it's definitely worth it."

The exhibits were built extremely well, and it made you feel as if you were traveling back in time. The lessons in tradition certainly shed a lot of light as to why our families had certain requests and expectations on various special occasions and holidays.I would definitely recommend anyone to visit the museum, as it brings perspective to why Hong Kong is shaped the way it is presently.Note: Wednesdays is free!

Personally we had a few hours, and skipped quite a bit to get to the more recent history of the past 200 years, which was of more interest to us. Entry is incredibly cheap, just like most of the museums and galleries in HK. We both hired English audio guides as well, although the exhibits were so well presented with an abundance of English explanations that we didn't use the audio guides much at all. This really is a high quality museum, with some impressive and inventive displays. Walk through a life-sized century old village to peek into the tea shop, post office, general store ... walk onto the life-sized Chinese fishing boat and hear about the life of the fisher people, and see three-story towers of buns and carvings of gods and emperors used for local festivals. Highly recommended to anyone who's curiosity has been aroused."

Very informative and provides a great amount of detail and understanding of Hong Kong's history in multiple different aspects, from its natural history (rock formations) to ancient history (Chinese dynasties) to modern history (cessation to British rule, Japanese occupation, 1997 etc.), and culture. The museum is very organised and the various exhibits are numbered in a chronological order so it is very easy to follow the development of Hong Kong. There are plenty of things to read and look at and it took me about 3+ hours to finish the whole museum, longer than I expected. By the way, note that the museum is closed on Tuesdays and has free entry on Wednesdays."

If you want to take an hour out to get some food you can get a stamp from reception and return later in the day. It is especially great for people who speak English as a first language as there are plenty of detailed explanations written in English. There are sections such as Hong Kong folk culture, the opium wars, the cession of Hong Kong, the Japanese Occupation during world war two and a lot of information on the return of Hong Kong back to China in 1997 from Great Britain. Fascinating museum with fantastic exhibitions and a must see for anybody visiting Hong Kong but especially for UK citizens as it is very relevant to their history!"

This is a relatively new museum that sets out, in different sections, the history of Hong Kong, with separate areas for pre-history, the cultures of the different people who settled there, the impact of the West, the Japanese/WW2 period, etc. The descriptions in English of the different exhibits are quite good; one can also rent an audio guide, but it is really not necessary. There are also a lot of videos, which run continuously in different languages, including English; when the audio portion is not in English there are English subtitles.The only slight negative is that the museum is limited to the history of Hong Kong, so one learns about the history of the Chinese dynasties only as they had an impact on Hong Kong."

Located centrally in Tsim Sha Tsui, this museum covering the history of one of the world's great cities is an outstanding cultural experience that will be enjoyed by all, and at a minor admission cost. Somewhat overcompensating by starting at (virtually) the dawn of man, the exhibition comes into its own when it begins to cover the religious culture that has helped shape the city before detailing the incredible upheaval caused by the Opium Wars (truly food for thought on what lengths governments will do for power), the invasion of Japan and the post-war boom that made Hong Kong the city it is today. Featuring a great many unearthed treasures from the distant past, the visitor also walks through life-size recreations of various periods of history exhibiting and explaining festivals, maritime events, pre-war streetscapes & shopfronts, the Japanese invasion (including propaganda extolling the virtues of the occupation to locals!) and the dauntingly small spaces that residents were housed in during the 1950s. Short films in local languages (subtitled in English), as well as English language versions, screen on constant rotation further outlining the city's history and evolution. Of great interest is the final section featuring the post-war cultural boom that covers the rise and rise of local cinema, consumerism and manufacturing. The handover of Hong Kong from England to China is covered in detail, however it did feel like this final section had been drafted with the mainland's sensitivities and agenda in-mind.Only disappointment was the lack of a shop. It must be said that the city's souvenir trade has been overtaken by mobile phone covers and cheap sunglasses. What I would have given for a take-home recreation of some of the brilliant pieces displayed from the 50s, 60s or 70s! In fact, we headed straight to HMV music afterwards to find some of the great local pop music playing in the later part of the exhibit. It plays as I write this very review: a great keep-sake after discovering a new found respect for the city in this museum."

Everything is labeled in both Chinese and English. The English translations are impeccable with none of the grammatical errors and typos commonly seen in Asian museum. My one criticism of the museum is it's failure to openly discuss the extreme apprehension many HK residents felt over the 1997 handover to China. It glosses over the Tiananmen protests of June 4 and its subsequent effect on the people of HK as they wondered if they would suffer similar political repression with the approach of 1997.Bottom line, if you have even a remote desire to know a little of HK's colorful history, this is an absolute must-see."

We were happy to speed through some of the early sections, which dealt with the early geology and pre-history. We especially enjoyed the folk customs, recreation of a street in Old Hong Kong, and later history of the place. There are several short films and other things to watch and listen to. Don't be in a rush as the place is laid out superbly and it's really easy to view most of the exhibits. I'd advise doing this early on your trip but in any event, this is MUST see."

Decided to be a tourist in my home town, and visited the Museum of History this past weekend, mostly because of a temporary exhibition of photos depicting Hong Kong since the mid 1800s. It costs HK$10 to visit the permanent exhibition (Story of Hong Kong), and HK$20 for both the permanent exhibition and the temporary exhibition.The temporary exhibition included a lot of exhibits depicting life in the early colonial days of Hong Kong (up to WWII), what the architecture was back then, how people dressed, what they ate, businesses that were in Hong Kong at the time. It is interesting (and surreal) to see what the streets that I go past every day now looked like back then. You can imagine many corners of Hong Kong then would be similar to places like... Singapore, Kolkata, Mumbai, or even, Vancouver.There are a number of sections in the permanent exhibition, including prehistoric, pre-colonial rule, colonial rule, and post WWII. A bit amazed that we even have archeological finds in the city (a number of pottery items on display from a number of different Chinese dynasties, all discovered in Hong Kong). There is a section depicting the different types of Chinese population that have settled in Hong Kong throughout the years and how we evolved from a fishing village to become a metropolis. And then there are some exhibits that would remind me of stories as told by my grandparents and my parents on what life was like in Hong Kong when they grew up."

I can only say again how impressive it was. The exhibits also interested the kids.Visited on a Wednesday = free.

Everything you could image was covered and it was fascinating to see some of the artefacts on display. Ancient arrow heads, axes and fishing hooks to name a few items.

Seeing as HK is what feels like the world-leader in constant re-invention, construction and commerce, much (all?) of its famous historical past is no longer visible, on the streets that have been reclaimed and rebuilt some time ago. As a result the Museum of History is well worth a visit if you want to see some visuals to go with the material you may have read about Hong Kong. This museum is large, detailed, and a lot of work has gone into explaining how the very islands were formed (I had no idea but was fascinated by the insight into the geology and carious climates the area had seen), the people and the artifacts, through to the much more political recent history. As well as the areas dedicated to the geological past and cultural heritage, I liked the recreated streets and shops of the colonial era, and the explanation of the handover from British to Chinese rule. It was especially interesting to analyse and read between the lines on the text which covers the handover of power. I don't think you can properly experience a destination without trying to form an understanding of where it has come from, so because of the absence of original buildings this museum forms a pretty important part of that in my opinion."

The museum does offer quite a bit for everyday tourists.If you are short of time, skip the first 2 areas at the lower level - the prehistory era, and go directly to the 3rd area where they start showing the history for the last 100 years, the culture of the four main groups of people that starts Hong Kong, etc.Be prepare to spend more time on the second floor with news clippings on quite a few interesting topics that made Hong Kong nowadays.Tours are offered on a regular basis. Daily in Cantonese and Mandarin. But there are English guide tours available, check the schedule. The knowledge and the stories of a lively tour guide will definitely make your visit that much more enjoyable. The admission is only HK$10, check the discount for senior 60 and over, and full time student"

This is a very well curated museum and is very much worth visiting if you are interested in any of a variety of historical aspects of Hong Kong. \u00a0The opening exhibition explains how the Islands came about over hundreds of millions of years, before providing details of the indigenous animals and plants of the region. \u00a0A section of jungle has been built complete with a stuffed, tiger, black bear, monkeys, a wild boar and a massive python amongst other jungle animals. The museum then moves onto the evidence of early human existence before fascinating exhibits the various cultures that have contributed to the city. \u00a0Life size replicas of traditional houses, boats, weddings and other cultural festivals are on display. \u00a0The section on the Opium Wars and the development of Hong Kong through e 18 th, 19 th and 20th centuries is very well presented and informative. \u00a0I learned a lot about the city and you coukd soend all day here.

Originally I wasn't expecting much since HK has a rather short history but after looking at the many positive reviews here I decided to include it in my itinerary. We visited the Museum at 11am and the entrance fee was very cheap, only 10HKD per person. Ended up leaving the place only at 4pm, since there were simply too many things to see and understand that we were overwhelmed in a positive way. I was pleasantly surprised. The Museum includes portions of history ranging all the way from prehistoric times to modern Hong Kong. The history of Hong Kong is indeed rather short, but the positive thing is that they included many aspects of culture, politics and economy as well to make the whole experience much more detailed and in-depth. Many resurrections of buildings, infrastructure, models and items of various territories and local people from different provinces of China were available, small cinemas dispersed at various corners of the exhibition area provided tourists with an insight into early/colonial Hong Kong life, entertainment, food and street culture, which I found really interesting and informative. Before this visit I knew roughly the history outline of Hong Kong, but after the visit I gained more knowledge on what exactly happened in between and the certain minisule details that I would never have known. The Science Museum is located just right opposite of the History Museum which I'm sure is a place that kids will enjoy very much."

If these wise words from Winston Churchill meant anything, it's expressing to us that Hong Kong has a prosperous future ahead of her. This is also probably the closest thing to a time machine you can ever find in the 21st century.Greeted by the kind staff at the ticket counter who then proceeded to collect an entry fee of $10 per person, it is without doubt that the museum is suffering huge operational losses every year in the noble name of preserving the memorable yet, at the same time, arguably bitter records of the previous centuries of Hong Kong. This past colony of the British Empire has faced many ups and downs, with the latter occurring at a higher frequency; yet, it continues standing up high undauntedly.At the first level of the museum, you will walk down a pathway that brings you back to the Hong Kong of the Devonian Period (~approximately 400 million years ago). Admittedly, I am no fan of Geography, so I briskly walked past these rocks which meant no more than mere rubble to me. At the end of this path, there is a theater which plays a video to summarize everything you had just seen (the videos are first played in Cantonese, then English and finally Chinese). The duration of the video is about 10 minutes, and if you missed the English version of the video, fear not as there will be English subtitles for the Chinese and Cantonese versions. These 'mini theaters' can be found in almost every corner of the museum to explain the different exhibits you have enjoyed. The topics vary from the Opium war and Japanese Occupation that took place in the now established Special Administrative Region to the natural disasters and early entertainments of the widely acclaimed Pearl of the Orient.In conclusion, this was the best place I have visited during my trip to Hong Kong. If the ruler of time were merciful and the cacophonous rumble of my stomach would cease, I would have willingly spent more than the 4 hours I spent in the museum."

The Hong Kong Museum of History is one of those gems, hands down the best museum in Hong Kong, and among the best museums I've ever visited. Not only does it provide a cultural, historical context for what you see and experience in Hong Kong, it is also a fun and quite extraordinary place. You are transported to many time periods with the help of full-scale replicas of old pawn shops, HK cafes, and fishing boats, and very useful information and history lessons posted on walls. There were many photo opportunities within the exhibits even inside a full-scale tram. I have visited have the museum many times and with each visit, I learned more about the historical significance of this strategic city. For tourists, it is a very good way to start a trip, from the very beginning of the city's birth, as far back as the stone age surprisingly, all the way to modern civilization. And best of all, it's free admission once per week. Make sure you allocate at least a few hours here. I made the mistake of trying to see it all in 1 hour and ended up missing a lot, but came back and spent another 2 hours on my next visit."

From small fishing communities, through major shipping port, the British Empire and now Chinese nationalism, the museum is a living experience. The kids loved the dioramas and colorful clothing and I enjoyed the sense of optimism that was always present through a myriad of radical changes in HK over the past 100 years.

We joined an English speaking tour guide and spent a pleasant and informative hour and a half with Cheung Wai-fung who clearly and simply lead us through the phases of Hong Kong\u2019s history form ancient times, through colonial influence to the present time under China's leadership. He was informative, approachable, and could be easily understood. The exhibitions are clearly labelled (no need of the audio guide if you can see to read the panels) and presented in a visually stimulating way. Please note that there did not seem to be any form of cafe for refreshments. There was a minimal entrance cost"

The museum certainly provides that! Covering nearly 400 million years of HK history, it is a bold and comprehensive narrative of this fascinating city. Far too much to handle in detail in one visit, we moved quickly through some of the geological displays and focused more on the 'history' of the upper floors. We thought the information was presented really well. Many of the exhibits include full-size replicas of the places and things described which really add to the experience. Well worth a visit!"

An excellent display of Qing Dynasty Court Costumes was visiting when we toured and it added a truly special bonus. The entry fee is very low for the quality of the displays.

At HK$10 this has to be the best buy in HK (even better than the HK2.30 ~ 25c tram fare) but the sheer scale is daunting. If you are history buff then at least 2 visits will barely do justice. I have often wondered why museums (Las Vegas casinos?) don't pump oxygen into the public area to give tired museum feet a pick me up?Lots of content, but the presentation style is very wordy, with lots of videos and some not very convincing 'representations'. I was surprised at the relatively muted 'colonists-did-us-wrong' tone. In truth the British have a lot to answer, especially in the early years.This said, the sheer hardship of life in China does come across very clearly and reinforces the need for a good clan system.Some gaps ~ the Vietnamese boat people crisis and the economic shift (back) to trading and finance (the beginning) from consumption goods assembly, which has left less educated HKers stranded.Museum employees are amazing engaged and despite very limited English were 100% eager to help.Recommended for a hot summer's day or when sheltering from a typhoon, but not a must."

There are clear signs directing you to each section should you only want to see one in particular.There are large exhibitions in each section with lots of artifacts and includes very detailed signs in English. There are many historical building recreations and my favourite area was the reconstruction of an entire village with a bank, tea shop, sweet shop and much more. It brings history to life vividly and we were lucky to have a whole day free so we got to see all of the exhibitions.One of the best museums I've been to through all of my travels."

Unless you're a rock hound, skip past the initial geological displays and enter the story of the early trader contacts, the opium wars and then the colonial period. My top three display areas: (1) Explanations and displays of Chinese festivals. Amazing colors, sounds and life-like displays. HINT: go behind the opera scene to see a real backstage setup and read about unusual dressing-room traditions. (2) Films and displays on the lead-up to the Opium Wars. (3) A walk through colonial Hong Kong! Walk through the bank; visit the apothicary, go behind the teller window of a pawn shop, check out the shops. This is as close to 1900 as you can get in this city (until they finish the old government square restoration in 2014)!"

That one was excellent, with detailed description of each display, as well as other interesting facts. I didn't catch the regular guided tour, but listened in on the tour given to visitors from an old folks' home. Fascinating. Spent more than 2 hours in there and was too tired to visit the Hong Kong Story. No photography allowed though. Came back another day for the Hong Kong Story (separate stubs on the same ticket). The guided tour was very informative, interesting and engaging (though I might have been lucky). It lasted about 1.5 hours and the area to be covered was quite big (2 floors). The front part was covering stuff that was a little too far back in time. Dinosaurs and stone age, and the first humans in the area. It got more interesting after that, talking about the early settlers, how they lived, and later folk culture and traditions. These were on the first floor, which you should complete before going to the second floor since you can't get back to the first floor within the exhibition (unless I missed some elevator somewhere). The second floor is more on the history, how HK came to be in such a special position. I didn't have time to catch the movies though. I felt that the information for reading was very dry, unlike the substantially more interesting and informative things that our guide told us. So check the timings and make it for the guided tour. Tips: freezing cold in there, so bring a nice thick jacket. There are resting areas and washrooms, even inside the Hong Kong Story exhibition. Bring a camera as there are lots to take (allowed in HK Story). Eat before going because you may end up spending quite some time in there."

The first floor, for me, a tad boring covering the early history of Hong Kong. The 2nd floor covers the economic and trade development of Hong Kong and various impediments along the way.Overall it was a big surprise as to the quality of the exhibits, interesting narrative and audio/video cues.Is this a MUST SEE? Probably not but for those looking to escape summer heat, this is a nice pause to the day. Plenty of nearby restaurants to make a morning/lunch activity."

Usually we would walk quickly through the geological history but this time we spent a long while there, as well as our favourites -the Chinese ethnic groups, festivals and celebration, Japanese occupation and post-war Hong Kong. The cafe is simple but a treat as is the little shop. It is a really lovely way to spend an afternoon."

The displays are extremely well done. The museum is laid out chronologically and if you have limited time and energy, most will want to pass beyond the first exhibits which deal with the geological formation of Hong Kong. It is interesting to see the Neolithic tools that have been unearthed, but Hong Kong's more recent history from the arrival of the first Europeans through the Opium trade and colonial period, the Japanese occupation and more recent history, are all more interesting.As noted, the museum fee, even on days other than Wednesday when it is free, is very modest HK$5."

We learnt a great deal - the museum covers the geological development right through the history of Hong Kong to the time when the British handed over rule to China. There is even information on what will happen in the future. Some of the displays/diaromas included celebrations for minority groups, resettlement estates in the 60's, made in Hong Kong toys and electrical items, street scenes etc.On one day a week there is free entry to the museum - but the entry fee on other days is cheap.The museum is good for adults and children. The museum is also closed on one day during the week so check before you go.It is easy to walk to the museum from Tsim Sha Tsui station and the Art Gallery is also well worth visiting ( located on the waterfront)."

So bring your own lunch, skip drinking a lot of liquids before your visit, or plan to leave after a couple of hours and you will have a very interesting time, especially the permanent exhibition, \"The Hong Kong Story\" which gives a fascinating glimpse of what this area was like from ancient times, through prehistoric, to dynastic and folk cultures. Bravo for this! The visiting Mesopotamia exhibition was of high quality as was the earlier one on Terracotta Warriors."

We had one half of a morning to spend in this Museum so we decided to concentrate on the exhibit which concentrates of the history of HK, and we were delighted with the choice! The exhibition starts at the prehistoric stage and ends at the handover of HK to China in 1997. The story is told with the help of some wonderful displays. Those that we particularly enjoyed were the cases of opium and the super depiction of the harbour at the height of its trading importance. The illustrations of the governors seemed to end before Governor Patten which was curious since the handover was dealt with in some detail. We combined this visit with one to the Heritage Museum in New Territories and they complemented one another well, albeit with some inevitable overlap. A great way to learn about HK, and not just for those who are dedicated history enthusiasts."

Staff were welcoming, friendly and incredibly helpful. They had storage cubicles for backpacks, and a wheelchair for our tired child (with a broken foot in an aircast). The permanent exhibit \"Hong Kong\" was interactive and informative. We also purchased tickets to the \"Mesopotamia\" exhibit (a joint venture with the British Museum) and were impressed with the quality of the exhibit. It was great for kids and adults. And the cost of both exhibits for a family of 3? $55HKD. A steal for 4 hours entertainment! A visit we would holy recommend!"

In the end, it was exactly that. The best thing was that it was only a short walk from my hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui on Nathan Road so that made for extra convenience as well. Anyways, the museum was set up very well and you can learn alot about the past history of HK, traditions, like weddings and festivals, food, and even the natural environs that HK was surrounded in many many years ago.  The displays are very well presented and one can easily spend a bit of time learning and gazing at all that is withheld in this museum.  Best of all, entrance to this museum for a single adult is only $10HK."

The earlier parts, although informative, wern't as interesting as the latter parts (i.e. pre-Opium war).Considering that they allow free entry on certain days (check their website), I would highly recommend the Hong Kong Museum of History and their \"Hong Kong Story\" exhibit!

Our first plan was to visit the Science Museum because it is close to Hotel Benito where we stayed. Unfortunately it was closed during our visit so we opted for the Museum of History. At first we thought it as just so-so but when we explored the inside, we were fascinated by the vast collection of artifacts and displays. We learned the origin of HK and their culture plus their way of life during the old times. We didn't get to explore the whole place for we were not expecting it to be huge and we're already hungry come lunch time. Truly it was a wonderful way to learn more about Hong Kong."

There were a few school groups, but they mostly congregated towards the Museum of Science, on the other side of the complex. The main exhibition is called \"The Hong Kong Story\" and traces Hong Kong's history from prehistory all the way up to the transfer of Hong Kong from the British colonial rule to China. It's a well-curated experience that highlights a lot of the essential historial points, filling in the many holes a tourist or visitor might have in understanding the complex and colorful past that makes Hong Kong special."

I left, hours later, informed, entertained, delighted. The museum takes you from the geographic formation of Hong Kong through each of the settling and original peoples [replete with life size dioramic room settings] through the Opium Wars and on to current times, inclusive of how Western culture influenced the Chinese. The exhibits were detailed, absorbing and vibrant. My only negative comment has to be about the snack bar. The food paled [literally and figuratively] to the museum. Don't bother to have more than tea. Also, the gift store was very unorganized, staffed by rather unfriendly women."

It's built like a timeline, starting with prehistoric times and ending with the handover to China. The first few sections of the visit, complete with caveman exhibits have you worried about the quality of the experience. By the time your through these first sections, the quality picks up considerably and the experience is a good one. A great combination of traditional Chinese culture and an interesting look at the impact of the Opium Wars and the British occupation that followed. An enjoyable days rest from food and shopping!"

Not too big, not too small and a great bargain for $10. Through 8 galleries, it covers the story of HK from prehistoric times to the current post-handover era. Each gallery is really well presented, with a very good mix of real artefacts, models and movies. There is a theatre in most galleries showing short movies. What I really liked is the unbiased view of history. Unlike museums in China, there is no Chinese propaganda here. In fact they have a very honest assessment of the shortcomings of the Chinese Imperial forces and the Imperial policies leading up to the Opium wars and the subsequent British takeover of HK. It deals even-handedly with the Japanese occupation during 1941-1945, and also with the handover to China in 1997. The handover ceremony is still fresh in many minds, and the displays with various invitation cards, newspaper reports etc are particularly poignant. The only topic that is not delved into is HK\u2019s relationship with mainland China since the handover and the thorny political issues, but to be fair, these topics are perhaps current affairs rather than history. The shop has a useful collection of books, old HK postage stamps along with some of the usual tourist tat."

One was given the strong impression that the British had done virtually nothing good for this place. I suppose it's to be expected, given that this is now part of China again, but the anti-British mood was quite uncomfortable. Hard to point at something and say 'See, here? THIS is propaganda, THIS is wrong', but the whole exhibit from the British period gave no positive information. It was rather sad."

You can easily spend all day in the museum, and you might not see it all. On Wednesday's you can enter for free. If you will be in Hong Kong for more than 3 or 4 days, and wish to visit other museums, spend the HK$30 (US$3.75) for the week-long pass, good at most, but not all of the museums in Hong Kong.When I visited, July 2012, there was a separate, temporary exhibition featuring Terra Cotta Warriors, on loan from Xi'an in the PRC. In that exhibition, you got to participate in interactive displays, walk through a multimedia show that was spectacular, and view many different examples of the Terra Cotta Warriors.

Well documented photographs along with artifacts, recorded stories and short films all contribute towards an excellent museum.This museum is especially great for teaching young generations (especially those with Hong Kong ancestry, but born abroad), as I've noticed parents and grand parents take pride in telling their own stories to their children. I saw grandparents point at photographs, telling their children that's exactly what life was like, or some even recognized the street or store front!!This is probably one of the better museums in Hong Kong, and should not be missed for visitors or even locals who live in the area.This is suppose to be a 'sister' museum to the Heritage Museum located in Sha Tin (which documents the development of the New Territories). However, I found that museum quite lacking in the excitement and engagement. I would recommend this museum rather than the heritage museumThe museum is all in English and Chinese; and the films alternate between English, Cantonese and Mandarin, and is located in East Tsim Tsai Shui and next to the Science Museum."

            "review": "Excellent museum, shouldn't be missed. Having been to Hong Kong several times over the last 2 years, I was wondering if there was anything worth seeing in the city that I had not yet visited. This time, as one of the perks offered on a recent conference trip, I took up the offer of a free visit (courtesy of a coupon from the Hong Kong tourism office).My initial impression was that the museum tried to include too much information. The exhibits started with the earth's creation and geological history, then moving on to its ecosystem (huh?)and neolithic man. But it started to liven up when the exhibits detailed the Yue people of southern China before going more in depth into the various Chinese dynasties. But where the museum really came into its own were the descriptions of the arrival of western civilisations that led to the Opium Wars and the creation of 'proper' Hong Kong. There were very good displays on the people that settled in the area (Punti, Hakka, Hoklo & the boat dwellers), their lifestyles and traditions. There was a terrific section on life in Hong Kong from the 1920s (including the Japanese occupation) and its modernisation, ending with its unification to China in 1997. Exhibits were varied, ranging from static displays to dioramas and mock-ups, as well as interactive walk-throughs and regular video shows.For me, this museum was proof that Hong Kong has a very good cultural attraction that is different from its usual set of distractions (shopping, eating, nightlife). It was well worth my time (about 4 hours) - Hong Kong should be proud of this museum."

The museum doesn't have any new stuff (it is pretty much the same as the one in 2007), but it is well maintained and doesn't feel old or worn down at all. And for just $30 HKD ($4) you can visit 7 different museums in a week. Everything is available in Chinese and English. This one is certainly one of the best museum to visit."

Visiting this excellent museum in November certainly helped connect to HK's past, and gave a context for present and future developments. Our cruise-ship visit was on a Wednesday when admission charges were free to both this museum and the science museum. The 'Terracotta soldiers' exhibition was next door and cost about one UK pound and was brilliant. I also visited a heritage centre in converted army barracks in the centre of Kowloon Park which was good, emphasising the importance of preserving both western and chinese historic buildings. For me the History Museum was the pick, and many of the displays quite beautiful. Well done to all involved."

The weather was atrocious back in April, so we actually spent 5 hours split over 2 afternoons in this museum - but I'm sure you could do it in 2 hours if you rushed.The English language displays are written really well, there's lots to see, huge statues, realistic boats, costumes - plus there's a number of theatres showing short films about a variety of topics - well worth seeing.My favourite part was the mock traditional street, complete with shops that you can go inside and a tram at the far end. Don't miss the huge theatre at the end before you take the escalator down, which has a brilliant film about the 'handing back' of Hong Kong."

I lived in Hong Kong for many years and this was not my first visit to the museum but I still found it absorbing. The visit is low-key as you enter but picks up interest as you progress and, especially if you are a first-time visitor to China, you will love the highly visual and interactive nature of the many exhibits. You will become engrossed in examining what is on display as you wander into old shops, old houses, board a junk or stare at the Chinese use of colours, their architecture or costumes. It is not an overly large museum but is of high quality and highly recommended - my friend, a Kuwaiti, had not seen anything like it enjoyed it as well. Plenty for all ages to enjoy here and I would be happy to go back again."

The history museum is on the left of the science museum and entry is on ground floor. There is variety in the presentation of Hong Kong\u2019s history such as boats, statues and movies. There is plenty of themed seating for those with tired feet. Due to space limitations, the museum is two storeys and some would find this bothersome. Entry fee is extremely cheap."

We went on Wednesday to take advantage of the free admission to the permanent exhibits, which taught me a number of facts that I did not already know. The special exhibit (The Majesty of All Under Heaven: The Eternal Realm of China\u2019s First Emperor) was very busy that day, so we went back on another day. For HKD$10 it was definitely worth seeing the terracotta warriors! The exhibit is on until November 26th and I would highly recommend it."

A sophisticated exhibition, it showed pictures of the emperor's early life, his philosophy, love of art and pictures of family life. His name, taken when he was declared emperor, means 'lasting eminence'. There was a fascinating 3-D audio-visual display of his palace and garden that could be built up and deconstructed progressively through the use of various control buttons available for visitors. Also there were some very smart graphics that showed the emperor\u2019s face as a young man progressing as a continuous graphic to old age as various key points in his life were explained. There was a very interesting letter from the Director of the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City in Beijing, expressing good wishes to the people of Hong Kong and delight at being able to share this important history with the people of this part of China. The museum is modern, cool in the heat, inexpensive to attend and there is a nice caf\u00e9 that served a great lunch."

As if the Hong Kong Museum of History wasn't good enough already, until the 26th of November 2012, there is a special exhibition featuring the Qin Terra Cotta Warriors from Xi'an, China called - \"The Majesty of All Under Heaven: The Eternal Realm of China\u2019s First Emperor.\" By all accounts, we found this special exhibition to be sublime, one of the very best HK$10 (US$1.29) we have ever spend. Tickets need be booked in advance, which can be done online at URBTIX. We really enjoyed everything that we saw at this special exhibition, particularly the multi-media contributions and the actual artifacts themselves. We spent just over 1.5 hours at this exhibition but the best parts could have been seen in perhaps just 45-60 minutes if you are in a hurry. The exhibition area is well laid out and easy to navigate. Displayed information is not overly wordy and artifacts are spaced out are all quite special to view. In all the exhibition felt very well planned, organized and executed. By comparison, this was a much better effort than the 'Dead Sea Scrolls' exhibition (US$25 per person) that we visited at the Discovery Times Square in NYC last year. Overall, this is a fantastic exhibition available for the small fee of HK$10 per person. If you are traveling to Hong Kong between now and the 26th of November, we'd strongly recommend that you take the time to visit this special exhibition at the Hong Kong Museum of History, especially if you are not planning to travel into mainland China to see the Terra Cotta Warriors in Xi'an. We are planning our second visit now, hoping to see it again before exhibition is finished.Hint: In addition to this visit, you should plan to see the Hong Kong Museum of History as well. This is an excellent museum that is child-friendly, informative with generally considered our very best in Hong Kong. Entry price is also HK$10 per adult, making this an equally excellent value for money experience."

Those disabled can use the pedestrian crossing first then the ramp up to the Museum with pleasant grounds. Inexpensive fascinating view of the history of Hong Kong in a beautifully well set out spacious surrounds. It starts off from pre historic times throughout the ages until more modern day, but the \"time travel \" is a truly spectacular journey depicting visually and auditory overwhelming precision of the background of this fascinating country of Hong Kong, enthralling visitors at every turn. You are transported back in time to the Big Bang, the development of the land, the water on the land, the rivers and lakes, miriad of islands, the geology, the history of it's first land dwellers, animals, reptiles, fish , bird life and insects. It has a real WOW factor, as it is all depicted so well. We particularly enjoyed the depiction of the buildings of yesteryear, transport, sea craft, trading, life of the boat dwellers and raised houses inhabitants.And currency and banks were explained, rulers and conquerors of the land, the Occupation of the area by the Japanese during the 2nd W.W., shops , festival displays, so many and varied amounts of history, all so fascinating, you could take many hours wandering around and still see more on a subsequent visit. I particularly loved the Opera Stage , costumes displayed, background of Chinese Music and other intruiging information. Special displays are held throughout the year, so you won't be disappointed to visit the H.K. Museum of history."

The museum is very informative, inexpensive, and fun to visit for children and adults alike. Although I didn't use it a lot, the self guided audio tours were helpful and extremely inexpensive. Helpful and friendly staff. I think three hours is about the right time needed to see everything at a relaxed pace. The only downside was that the bookstore at the end did not have their souvenir books organized in any recognizable form or manner, so there was no use looking for anything that had inspired me in the previous three hours, other than trinkets and postcards."

You'll need over 4 hours to complete it. There are several video's playing in special rooms. They are certainly worth your time.The museum is unique for it's size and the way everything is built.

While there is much emphasis on China\u2019s influence on Hong Kong (which is true), there is too little mentioning of the British influence on Hong Kong once it was ceded to Britain (which is very important in terms of shaping modern Hong Kong) \u2013 it\u2019s as if the British rule was very minor in the whole course of its history. There also appears to be a lot of Chinese patriotism in this museum suggesting the great excitement of the return of Hong Kong to China\u2026exemplified by the fact that the final videoclip about \u2018the celebration of the return of Hong Kong to China\u2019 was played simultaneously with an old song called \u2018tomorrow will be better\u2019 (sang in Chinese) in the background\u2026and the museum information written ends with Chinese patriotism.Other than the slight personal disturbance descried above, I do think it is a great museum to visit especially for someone who doesn\u2019t\u2019 know much about Hong Kong history. The museum is cheap and definitely worth a look. You can spend a whole day here to look at everything properly; but if you don\u2019t have time, 3 hours there is definitely worth it. Many audio-film/clips (with English subtitles) and visual displays are available. For those on tight-budget, I recommend visiting on Wednesdays for free.The great thing about this museum is that it is spacious with lots of seats around for you to sit if you\u2019ve been standing and walking for too long \u2013 a good feet rest before getting up and moving onto the next area of displays. Like department stores, the air-conditioning inside also makes it a great place for heat-escape during summer with the additional benefit of getting some learning done.Walking to the museum isn\u2019t difficult (around 15 minutes\u2019 walk) especially when there are signs of direction once you leave Tsim Sha Tsui east station. If lost, ask the locals \u2013 they all know where the museum is.A visit to the museum does overall add to the fun of the whole Hong Kong trip."

It's always fascinating to go to museums in foreign countries, but the presentations on the Opium Wars and history of the relationship with Great Britain were especially interesting. The museum is very colorful and has fantastic exhibits for kids, interspersed with short film vignettes. The staff were especially helpful, knowing when the English version was going to start and pointing us to the movies. The gift shop also had some inexpensive and fun finds. We walked there from the Star Ferry and it was a good hike. Maps don't provide you with adequate information regarding the entrance so we ended up walking around the building (the entrance is on the south). But the walk through the park and neighborhoods were also fun on the way."

Grew up in HK and moved to the U.S. when I was 10, I have a limited knowledge of the city that I was born at. The museum gave me such a great snapshot of the city with emphasis on how the British acquired the colony and the war with Japan and finally the industrialization of the city. I was so impressed with the presentation of it all and it definitely meets right up there with museums in Europe and Washington D.C. and NYC in the U.S. I was so happy to finally learn so much about the city that I grew up in and love!

Many people wonder if there is nothing but Shopping in Hong Kong, but after a visit to Hong Kong Museum of History, it will forever change your understanding.Hong Kong has a solid historical background, starting from a small fishing village, transforming into a pirate bay during the Dynasty times. Then being a British Colony forever changed it role into a business hub and Major world city. Surviving through Japanese Occupation during the World Wars. And finally returning to China ruling under one party two system.Hong Kong Museum of History is a great place to learn about Hong Kong, you will learn amazing facts and history that even most locals have never heard about.Our last visit lasted 2-3 hour and we still haven't finished, hopefully you will enjoy as much as we have."

If you're genuinely interested in the history of Hong Kong, you could spend hours here. If you must do it in an hour or two, I suggest you review the galleries ahead of time and skip straight to what you want to see. You could spend an hour in just one gallery. If you happen to have been to the Royal BC Museum in Victoria, Canada, that will give you and idea of what to expect here. The more information-oriented galleries are contrasted with others that recreate aspects of the island's history, including a life-size recreation of a street in 1920s Hong Kong.As someone else said, the first couple of galleries are about the natural history and habitat of Hong Kong. Not terribly interesting unless you're really into that sort of thing, but there's a 10-minute movie that sums it all up if you have time to watch it. The environmental gallery is built around a life-size faux forest habitat with information on all the birds and mammals in Hong Kong trough out the ages. There's a short, but fairly interesting gallery on prehistoric Hong Kong, complete with a life-size model of what it might have looked like -- prehistoric men building rafts and so on. From there, you enter the gallery that takes you through Hong Kong under the various Chinese dynasties.I was a bit disappointed in this gallery,because it seemed a bit heavy on artifacts and archeological information but short on context. That is to say, I would've liked to have read or seen more interpretation about what life was like in Hong Kong under the different rulers. Instead you get a lot of \"we found pieces of this in this location, this location this location and this location,\" without much analysis. Also, even though I studied Chinese history in University, I found it hard to keep up with the references to the different dynasties, aside from the major ones (those ones where China is split into several kingdoms I can never remember). Unless you've got them all burned in your mind, you may need to consult Wikipedia on your smart phone as you're walking through. It would be nice if the museum had a nice big timeline or several maps of different eras to help visitors orient themselves a bit.On the other hand, the Folk traditions gallery is just lovely. It recreates aspects of the lives of different minorities who lived in Hong Kong.I rushed through most of the galleries concerning the British occupation, the Opium Wars and the Japanese occupation as I was running out of time, so I can't comment on those I'm afraid.But the modern Hong Kong gallery is just wonderful....I life-size recreation of a 1920s Hong Kong street. I just wish that there was more information about the squatter village and resettlement homes. I've been fascinated by my reading about them elsewhere and wanted to see more at the museum.All in all though, I thought this museum was very well-done and well worth a visit. If you want to learn more about Hong Kong, this is a must-see. And I suspect you could even keep the kids amused here for an hour or two."

You can probably rush through the geology and natural history sections, but you will really start to slow down from the ethnography section in gallery 4! The exhibit about folk culture in HK is worth is weight in 24ct solid gold. It's colourful, interesting, captivating, and attempts to show the culture and traditions of the various ethnic groups that HK is comprised of. The recreation of various processions, a Chinese temple and Chinese opera props will have you spellbound.Upstairs, the four sections on local history cover the Opium wars, birth and growth of the city, Japanese occupation and the modern city/ return to China. Recreations of a pawn shop, a post office, a bank (man, is that really what HSBC looked like?), a herbal tea shop and early tourist posters are priceless. And there is also a full sized tramcar preserved inside.Allow for at least three hours to do justice to the museum. There is a large cafe at the upper level if you fancy a coffee and snacks, but it is a little complicated to find.Don't miss the HK Museum of History if you are ever in HK."

Although not in depth, it made me curious to learn more and prompted me to do a little more research on my own to learn about different aspects of the history. I hadn't realized the incredible transformation Hong Kong has undergone in the past sixty years from a very rural to extremely modern society. Coming from San Francisco where museums are $12 - $20 a pop, it's amazing to me that this museum is so inexpensive. There's a small cafe and wifi.I'd recommend against taking the guided tour, however. Even though we were a small group, the guide seemed to have a set \"spiel\" which she didn't wish to vary from. I would have liked to have been able to have more dialogue with her, but she didn't seem to have a very extensive grasp of the information. We ended up rushing through the end of the exhibit, and because it was my first day I was too tired to go back through on my own. I think 2 - 2 1/2 hours would be a good amount of time to allot for a visit."

Interactive videos and films are available throughout the exhibit. English or Japanese speakers can avail the audio guide for just 10HKD though most of the panels and films do have English translations.I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation of artifacts from archaeological researches throughout the island. I also like the sense of continuity of the museum, giving you a feel that you are travelling through time. I spent more than 3 hours in this museum and I honestly didn't expect it to be that fun and informative. Tip: Best day to visit is Wednesday since admission is free."

It has been dwarfed by attractions such as the world renowned Peak Trams; the new Sky100 on the Kowloon side, the Landmark shopping mall...etc. Little did i realize this little museum had so much to offer.The museum display is based on a one directional self guided tour, which you start with walking through the geological composition of Hong Kong dated to tertiary and Jurassic periods which explain why there are so many little islands in Hong Kong, then followed by a path to archaeological findings in Hong Kong and Kowloon islands, which then outlines the history of some of the earlier settlers. Slowly, you walk through the path along with the history of time on the early HKG, how The British won the opium war that forced China to give up this region to The Empire which has made HKG what HKG is now, then you will see from the early light industry of making plastic flowers to the renaissance in the late 60's, 70's and 80's with a lot of photos and display of Made in Hong Kong industrial products which you can be very well familiar with. I recommend that you fit the museum visit in your itinerary and make it the first visit, after which you can relate a lot better to some of the places that you will visit---literally everywhere you see in HKG and its British overtone but with the populace primarily Cantonese is all explained in this museum. I deeply believe that a visit to this museum will make your trip more enjoyable. Cheers."

In my opinion, what they've done best is not focus only on politics or sociology, but also on geology, geography, culture, and even daily living as it was in the past. All this is organised in such a way that you walk through the museum following an actual timeline, from the earliest pre-habitation days up to the recent past. Many different reconstructions allow visitors to feel like they are in the middle of things. A good gift shop and coffee shop are there also, and the whole experience was really positive. It's not just for visitors to Hong Kong, but also for local and expatriate residents. Very highly recommended. Maybe go on a weekday, if possible, to avoid some of the crowds."

The sheer scale of the museum is staggering, with ceilings over three stories tall and entire buildings reconstructed inside. The interpretation is also interesting, particularly if one knows anything about Hong Kong history or public history. There is certainly a pro-Chinese take, and some anti-British and anti-Japanese interpretations. For instance, an eighth of the museum is dedicated to the little over three years of Japanese occupation. The section on the Japanese occupation is brilliantly done, with the entire architecture of the space changing from the rest of the museum to create a feeling of oppression. The museum costs only $10 HKD and is free on Wednesday. It would be easy to spend at least a couple of hours there. This is among the better history museums in the world."

It isn't just the recreated fishing boats, tea shops, streets, documentation, or the concise shows that draw you in, but just the grandness of the place that is so out of character for space-conscious Hong Kong. They have something to appeal to every kind of learner, from sensory perceptions to artwork to historical details to geology.

If I had it to do over, I would probably skip the pre-historic portions of the exhibit in order to spend more time on the later portions. The section that explains the four ethnic groups that settled in and around Hong Kong is simply amazing. The exhibit covers the history of Hong Kong well - examining colonial history, Japanese occupation, and the reversion to Chinese control. Oddly, the exhibit ends with the 1997 transfer from British to Chinese control. I would like to see some coverage of life since 1997. But a definite must-see for first time visitors.

This is highly ranked for good reason - it's an excellent all-weather way to learn everything you need to know about this fascinating place throughout the ages, including its geology, inhabitants, culture and much more besides. With its well laid out and clearly labelled exibits, many other museums throughout the world could learn much from the HKHM's example. And it's virtually free to get in (HK$10). Allow at least 3 hours to do it any justice at all.We were in HK for a 24-hour stopover and do not in any way regret spending many of our waking hours during that period at the museum. It opens at 10am and bear in mind that it's closed on Tuesdays."

My wife was brought up in Hong Kong and was amazed by what she learnt about a city she thought she knew well!We were there for almost four hours, if we had not been pretty tired after a 12 hour flight the previous day we would have stayed longer. I would not want to try to cover the whole place with children in tow. But it is so cheap (about 50 pence sterling, free some days) that you could easily take them a couple of times if necesary. It is so big that although there were a lot of people around it was never crowded.The cafe seemed to only cater for chinese style so we did not eat there so can not comment. It appeared rather disapointing in comparison to the rest of the museum.This museum is VERY well done and highly recommended."

TA doesn't give you a choice, so I have checked \"fee\" because more often than not, you do have to pay a tiny price to enter! \u00a0I also checked that you should allow for more than three hours in this venue. I come from a city, that I believe, \u00a0to have the best museums in the world: New York City. I was raised on going to museums and so I am a bit of a museum snob. The Museum of History in Hong Kong is wonderful. It doesn't try to do too much and it is clear that they offer an overview of the history of Hong Kong. I agree that you can probably skip the prehistoric level, but they have films for the major history parts, so I recommend at least viewing the film in the prehistoric section as watching the animation of the land forming is fascinating. I appreciate that the museum has these films available in four languages, running continuously throughout the day. For the Japanese Occupation section, I stayed and watched that film in English and with English subtitles. This section was particularly interesting and well done! \u00a0There are plenty of WC facilities and they are clean. There are four floors accessible via escalators and ramps. Some of the lighting is not camera friendly, but photos are perfectly fine and you will want to take them! If you are tired, just catch one of the movies. There are also places to rest in between exhibits. The souvenir shop was well stocked and the proprietors spoke English; they also accept credit cards. Hong Kong's history is long and varied and this museums helps to condense most of it into an easily digestible history \"lesson\" including the two devastating typhoons that destroyed homes and started deadly fires. I spent 4.5 hours here and only left because hunger called. I would go back and I would bring my attention-deficit husband with me, as I know he wouldn't get bored here! It is also a worthwhile stop if you have already hit the touristy high points already. It is child-friendly as well, especially if you go on a Wednesday! I am tough to impress and I really enjoyed this museum. Please note: I think you have to walk the two flights of stairs to the main entrance. When I went, all other street-level doors were locked, thus forcing me to walk around the entire building. Some German tourists I met later, said they encountered the same issue."

The ground floor talks about prehistoric history and the geology, which wasn't too interesting, but the 1st floor was eye-popping with a large number of carefully replicated traditional HK establishments (bank, shops, etc), a replica houseboat, replica houses, etc. If you're a photographer, you could probably spend all day snapping away (photos allowed but no tripods).

So coming back to Hong Kong, I really wanted to see this again! This time I had to drag my aunt with me, who really really is not a museum person because she thinks it's boring. For 10 HK Dollar, you can see how Hong Kong evolved into the current booming awesome city it is now! Even my aunt was excited and tucked me to go ahead. especially the part that reminded her of her own childhood was something she really enjoyed, like the cinema, the stores, ... All of the replica's there are so nicely put together. It really does make you feel like you made a journey through time. For all the non-Chinese people, this museum is a very nice one to get in touch with the Chinese culture. From wedding ceremonies to British occupation, etc... it's like getting a crash course. There's also a special exhibit every now and then. When I came there, it was about daily life during the Mao Zedong regime. Last time with my friend, they were talking about the Revolution in 1911. So definetly a must see! We spent 3 hours in that musuem!!! And I wouldn't get tired of it! Next time I go back with my family, I will take them there again!!!You can reach this museum by subway, but it's quite far away, so for those who don't wanna walk. Just take a cab. And for those who don't mind like me... Just follow the signs. It's REALLY obvious.Have fun!!!"

Hong Kong Museum is the wonderful tour I never had before, the location is just opposite of science museum and is free-of-charge every Wednesday. I was there on Wednesday, so no need to pay ....haha.I had spent about 2hrs in the Museum. Basically, If you really want to know about Hong Kong's history and other aspect, visitors should spend about 2-3 hours in the Museum. I left Museum after 2hrs as I was rushing to other places, by the way, I was not finished the everything in Museum.I really like the presentation here, they present very full picture of Hong Kong's development from ancientry to current. We can easily know the history clearly. Also, there are not only the things presented on the table, but they present films to attract the visitors, interesting films.However, you will feel boring if you are not interested on learning the history. All depend on your interest.Regards,Heroes19http://newzealand-paradise.blogspot.com/"

Ridiculously cheap, $10hk adult, and even free on Wednesdays.A good bad weather day thing to do, or if you're really sick of markets, but otherwise I would think there are more fun outside things to do.I found the museum clever in the way it was set out, via epochs and eras, and you start back in the primordial ooze of Hong Kong, and make your way forward in time to Modern Hong Kong. It covers 9 eras, ie 9 sections. I enjoyed the fossils, and geology, the stoneage and archaology the most. Probably the modern stuff the least. But maybe would have liked it more if kids were more interested. They liked it but didn't love it. It was enough after 2 hours. Expensive gift shop.Overall great museum, just the right kind of info, presented cleverly with great displays and 'real' landscapes etc. (real ancient street, 'real' bamboo jungle, etc.)"

This museum, however, is designed to be informative and entertaining. I had planned to only stay an hour, and ended up staying for at least 3. The layout of the exhibitions takes you through the history from the rocks of HK through the end of the departure of the British in 1997. All of the displays are interactive and there is a heavy emphasis on different types of media. I learned so much during my visit to this museum and loved the installations as they gave a genuine feel to every time period of HK. I highly recommend visiting this museum, especially if you aren't a museum person. Not only does it give context to so much of Hong Kong's culture, but it builds your understanding of what makes Hong Kong exceptional."

Rent the audio guide for 20 HKD which is well worth the cost. Be warned, that if you listen to all the stops, you will spend a lot of time at the museum. The museum goes through 4 major periods of Hong Kong. One of the more fascinating sections describes the 4 different groups that settled in Hong Kong - Boat Dewellers, Hoklo, Hakka, Punti.It is amazing to realize how far Hong Kong has progressed. From basically a 3rd world country after World War 2 to today's modern society's that is a hub for business/finance. I find it fascinating to learn why some countries/societies are able to develop so quickly, while other do not.I went on Wednesday, when all the \"major\" Hong Kong museum have free admission.

The building is huge with numerous exhibits--we only made it through the first floor before having to leave. Would have loved to stay, but we needed to eat lunch and the museum restaurant isn't very good.Best part: this museum is incredibly cheap! We got the student discount, so our total admission was the equivalent of about USD 1.25. Even w/o the discount, it's that much per person. Definitely worth a visit, and very easy on your wallet!"

At HK$10, there is an incredible amount on display at the HK Museum of History for you to see. The place is huge with 7 galleries full of interesting historical displays and information. Gallery 1 -The Natural Environment: This is ok, a bit like a natural science museum, showing how the geology of what is now called Hong Kong has changed over the life span of the Earth. Its interesting but not as great as later galleries. The reconstructed forests and jungles are ok. Gallery 2 - Prehistoric Hong Kong: This is a pretty good gallery showing the life of pre-historic humans and their lives in Hong Kong. Its interesting and helps build up context for the next Dynasty gallery. Gallery 3 - The Dynasties: This is where Chinese history starts to mingle with Hong Kong and there are some nice artifacts, antiquities and even a tomb display helping to build context around China, Hong Kong and how they fit together, historically. Gallery 4 - Folk Culture in Hong Kong:This is a FIVE STAR display section with a Sampan (junk boat), salt fields, fish salting, Hakka style house, Punti (ancient locals) house, temples, Opera House, Dragon Dance, Bun Festival, the list seems to go on and on. This is the highlight Gallery of the downstairs area. The displays are well presented and enjoyable. The kids running around are evidence that even they can find joy in this museum. Gallery 5 (upstairs) - The Opium Wars: This area is very interesting if you want to learn about western (European) powers becoming involved in China. There is a very good theatre show (10 minutes) about the period leading up to the first opium war. The miniature figure model of the destroying of opium by the Chinese is really nice. This is the second or third best gallery 4. Gallery 6 (upstairs): Birth and Early Growth of the City: There is a wonderful display of many early Hong Kong shops, it looks like a village as you walk in and out of an old HSBC bank, post office, tea dealer, pawn shop, Chinese medicine shop, upstairs teahouse. You get a real sense for Hong Kong's early 20th century modernization and development, pre-Japanese occupation. This is the second or third best Gallery in the museum, along with Gallery 5.Gallery 7(upstairs)- Japanese Occupation: This is a small section but quite interesting if you want to know more about the short period of time Hong Kong was under Japanese rule. Few displays, mostly information you can read. Gallery 8: Modern Metropolis and the Return of China This is the last Gallery and covers the periods of Hong Kong's explosive period of economic growth, through the British hand-over to China in 1997. The gallery sort of stops after the hand over in 1997 but that is fine as you're going to be quite tired from seeing 8 comprehensive galleries. Overall, we strongly recommend a visit to the Hong Kong Museum for visitors, unless you are here on a 1 day layover and prefer to see a theme park or HK island sights only. We'd advise you to make time for this museum, especially if you're here for a week or so. There will most likely be at least one bad weather day, perfect for spending a few hours indoors. For HK$10 per person, this is likely one of the best value for money museums you'll find anywhere."

We both expected to spend an hour and ended up spending over four hours touring the museum. The layout is clever--starting with prehistory and the geology of Hong Kong and then proceeding through time in different sections. I particularly enjoyed the mid-20th century street, complete with shops (apothecary, grocer, post office) that have been moved in their entirety into the museum. As expected for Hong Kong the English explanations were virtually perfect. Interestingly, the English and Chinese texts were not always word-for-word translations so if you read both it is entertaining to compare them. The differences were benign: in some case the Chinese text mentions historical figures or additional details that Hong Kongers would know about from school but that would simply be confusing detail for non-locals. Also, the videos, and in particular those dealing with the opium wars and with the British colonial period (I'm not a Brit) are factually correct and critical but thankfully lack the over-the-top anti-foreigner hagiography that is typical of museum exhibits on the mainland. I highly recommend this museum, and suggest you visit it early during your holiday in HK as it will inform the rest of your visit. Tip: the museum gets a lot of school groups (all ages), who are there from about 10-2. If you enjoy their enthusiasm (as I did) visit in the morning. If kids aren't your thing visit in the afternoon--the kids thin out after lunch and are all gone by 2 pm."

We visited the Hong Kong Museum of History hoping to get a good overview of the origins and history of how the city had developed..The museum is excellent, taking one back through to the geographic and anthropological origins then through the development of Hong Kong through early Chinese History, to the Opium Wars and the British 'occupation', World War 2 and the hand-over to China. Brilliant use of contemporary photography as part of the exhibitions."

            "review": "Probably my favourite part about Hong Kong. If you find yourself bored at the beginning of your tour, or if you don't have much time to spend there, you might want to skip the first 2 galleries, which centered on the geological evolution of the area (basically, lots of rocks), and prehistoric Hong Kong (a bit more interesting than the first, but I guess very similar to other exhibitions depicting the period) respectively, and move on to the rest. The exhibits were really detailed and provided lots of insight as to the locals' ways of life in the olden days and how Hong Kong progressed to the bustling city it is today. some of which you can still vaguely see around Hong Kong (especially in the Kowloon areas). There are artifacts on display as well as mock-ups of various \"scenes\" e.g. typical family home, sundry shop, school/classroom, caf\u00e9/tea room, holiday celebrations, and loads more. I spent roughly 3 hours walking around in the museum and it got very tiring (I am young and able-bodied, just to get it out there), and sadly had to speed up a bit towards the last gallery. If you are a genuine history buff and want to truly take in everything you see, consider making two trips down to the museum(or have a lunch break at the museum's caf\u00e9), although you probably won't be able to tear yourself away the first time round. There are guided tours and audio aids available but I found the write-ups accompanying each display to be sufficiently informative."

Our family (including 3 children aged 9, 8 and 6) all spent a few hours ot the HK Museum of History to see part of the Hong Kong Story exhibition - more time would have been needed to see all of it. It is an amazingly well designed exhibit covering HK from its geological background (the least interesting part), right through to the current day.Our children particularly liked the cultural parts of the exhibit eg. Cantonese Opera, Cheung Chau Bun Festival and the sections about the main groups of Chinese people that settled in Hong Kong (where you could see the clothes, farms, boats, etc).The size of the exhition - and the time we spent on the first half - meant that we saw very little of the second half. Our children were ready to go elsewhere after the 3 hours we spent in the first half. If we had realised how big it was we would have moved a little faster in the first half (and skipped the geological section) to enable us to see more about the British and Japanese in HK.The exhibition is one of the best we have been to - no expense has been spared in putting it together.It is well worth a visit - if no kids you could spend a full day there - with kids a half day (could do the full exhibition by spreading it out over two visits). At just $10 HK entry for an adult it is amazing value."

We have been back to Hong Kong on a further seven occasions and each time we have visited the museum when it has been possible, the most recent time was in March 2009 and each time we have found something to add to our knowledge of Hong Kong. It takes you back to a more gentle time before the 'money-hungry' touts that prey on the tourists.The staff at the museum are very helpful and well informed and open to questions about Hong Kong.It is a 'Must See' place which entails a pleasant walk through a great shopping area out of the main stream shopping in Kowloon."

Our guide enriched our experience by his enthusiasm and knowledge. We returned later that same day because we wanted to visit some of the exhibit again, but found that a third trip was necessary to take in all of the movies (either in English or with English subtitles) that animated the exhibit.I would highly recommend a visit to the Hong Kong Museum of History for anyone visiting Hong Kong - whether interested in history, or not. At the very least, it's an air-conditioned, colorful, well-designed space. At its best, it instills one with a sense of the fortitude of the people who lived through some wonderful and terribletimes.To adequately appreciate the Story of Hong Kong exhibit, allot at least four hours for your visit. Because of the depth and breadth of information, I would advise multiple short visits. If the HK$10 entrance fee is a deterrent, consider visiting the museum on Wednesday when it is free. The museum is closed on Tuesdays."

We were there when there was also a \"100 years of China\" exhibition, so allow another hour for that - the old news bulletins on crackly old cinefilm and the many information panels with copious pictures were fascinating. It reminded me how terrible my modern history was taught at school. If you can leave without shedding a tear at the final video of the handover in 1999 you are indeed a hard man!!

Make sure to see it in order because they arranged it in order from prehistoric times in the actual formation of the island, to the historic dynasties, to modern times covering Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during WWII, to the television revolution in the 70's, and finally to modern Hong Kong.You will learn many things you might not have already known about Hong Kong as well as a few things about the world from Hong Kong's eyes. Bring your camera, empty your memory card, and recharge your batteries. You will find yourself taking plenty of photos. There are movies in every section of the museum with a short 7-10 minute film relating to the section it is in. The films play in Cantonese, Mandarin, then in English. There is a clock on the wall by the auditoriums that tell you how long until the next showtime in the language you prefer.Make sure to go on Wednesday when it's free, but even if you can't make it on Wednesday, it is pretty cheap to get in. It's worth it, make sure you check it out."

It covers everything from archeology, anthropology, architecture, sociology, popular culture to animal and plant life! They have real artifacts from centuries and millenniums past, life-size mock stores and houses from decades ago, even a retired tram that you can walk in, and numerous movie rooms narrated in three languages elaborating on every aspects of the topics they cover.It was so well designed that all the life-sized models, the computer terminals, the displays, the short video rooms, and detail descriptions are always right there if you want them. Anywhere you stand there's a sight to behold.Yet you will not feel overwhelmed. You can just as happily spend a whole day there reading every fine print or briskly stroll through the main show pieces in 30 minutes -- but you will be impressed."

It starts at the very beginning when Hakka settlers from China came to Hong Kong on their live-aborad Junk boats. As you walk through the museum, there are various movie rooms, displays and recreations of old pawn shops or post offices which were typical in the colonial days. There are also many photos of old Hong Kong.Walking though this museum is truly an education in Hong Kong history. At the end of the tour, there was a film about the handover day back to China in 1997. I was in Hong Kong on this date partying in Lang Kwai Fong. The film about the handover day literally evoked so much emotion in me, that I almost cried.This is by far the most worthwhile museum to see while you are in Hong Kong. You will learn so much about the rich culture and history of this vibrant city."

We were especially interested in visiting the permanent exhibit \"The Story of Hong Kong\".

We returned later that same day because we wanted to visit some of the exhibit again, but found that a third trip was necessary to take in all of the movies (either in English or with English subtitles) that animated the exhibit. In \"The Story of Hong Kong\" entire streets are built into the museum to give a feeling of what it was like to live in pre-WWII Hong Kong. In the wing on Traditional Cultures a parade of statues recreates the Bun Festival on Cheung Chau Island. Cymbals, drums and Cantonese opera are heard in the hall.The Hong Kong Museum of History was impressive in the scale of its exhibits and in the depth of the information given. School groups of children were engaged by the interesting artifacts that they could touch and play on (like the sampan boat rebuilt in one gallery), and adults paused to read documents like the Treaty of Nanking. I would highly recommend a visit to the Hong Kong Museum of History for anyone visiting Hong Kong - whether interested in history, or not.
