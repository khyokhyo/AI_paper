            "review": "Pristine high-end fashion hub. Ginza was where we stayed the second time we visited Tokyo. In terms of location I can't fault it. You'll find it to be very central, and most locations in Tokyo are only one train away (rather than having to change lines).The area itself is very clean, and is home to all the major fashion labels from around the world. If you have the money I'm sure this would be a fantastic place to shop. I found that nearly every store in Ginza is fashion and/or makeup. You won't find any arcades or electronics stores.On the weekends they block off some roads to traffic and set up tables and chairs in the middle of the streets. That's how busy this area gets when people aren't working. It's actually amazing to see and feel the contrast between a weekday and the weekend.You'll also find a great many restaurants in and around Ginza. They range from very fancy and expensive (in the heart of Ginza) to fairly cheap, so it's worth having a look around for a decent place that fits your budget. A nice bowl of ramen can certainly hit the spot without hitting your wallet, and the portions are generous.Personally, I believe that had I stayed in Ginza on my first trip to Tokyo I would have been disappointed. It's really not the Tokyo you see in the movies. For a second visit however, the location is fantastic for getting around."

Very central and with some truly interesting architecture, it goes for several blocks and makes for an interesting stroll. Only downside is that the stores are predominantly the same brands you see in every major city, even though I'm advised that some of the clothes are different."

Went with Hubby and our 9 year old son so I couldn't do much real shopping. I am sure there are plenty of department stores and brand name shops in the area if you are into shopping. It was nice walking around the streets and seeing some unusual shops, e.g. the 6 or 7 storey Uniqlo shop in Ginza with pretty impressive window display. Also went to the Apple store in Ginza but was a bit disappointed. Not as a grand as I expected."

This is a very long and complicated stretched of road with lots of eateries ( under the major bridge ) or Restuarants within the shopping areas. It get confusing even when you use Google map to try to walk from the subway to other large department stores like Muji and Tokyo Hands. I have fun searching for my dinner place. Firstly within the submay station. Saw a beef/ steak store and when I sat down and they handed me the English menu, I realised it is a specialty store that sell every beef tongue dishes. I walked out apologetically and asked if there are any other eating area. The Young waiter directed me and accompanied me to the main road and with his Japanese pointed me to the streets parallel saying there are more sushi and beer drinking places. It was very nice and gracious of him to help me. I do ended up having a very pleasant sushi set dinner under the green metal bridge for dinner. After venturing through the alley that sell beer and local Japanese food in the open space, I decided to give it a miss since I am eating alone. Will come back with colleagues and friends next time. After dinner to walk around and trying to get to Muji store. But it was too late, the store closed at 9 pm and I turned back to The station to go back hotel. I will come back again."

Maybe when I first visited 12 years ago, it was awesome because you're still in college and all the glamour and glitter were eye candy and uplifting to the soul. Now, it's just another neighborhood that's mostly catered to well off tourists or those who have saved up to spend on a limited edition item. I'm not against any of those, but shopping for designer goods isn't cheapest in Japan so I don't understand why anyone would want to go crazy here. However, Japan is known for issuing certain colors or crossover items you can't get elsewhere so that would be a good reason then. I thought I would see more architecture design wonders but that wasn't the case. Skip...I'd rather visit a neighborhood with more character and grit that really serves the locals instead."

The Chanel building becomes a giant video screen showing a black and white montage. The Cartier building next door subtly changes colour. The window displays in Tiffanys and major labels are like art. Go a street or two off the main strip and you uncover more restaurants than you'll have time to try. And the bars!

This is an area nearer from Tokyo Station or Imperial Palace Hotel, always well lit in the night, very safe and one can find almost any high end shopping item from Electronics to Cosmetics to Stationary to Clothing. Ginza is a very enjoyable atmosphere. Very organized, wide sidewalks (pavements), and you will also find Office goers reminding you of San Francisco Union Square.

Unlike Shibuya, Shinjuku and Harajuku, Ginza is home to the young female shopper with a wallet full of credit cards. Tokyo is a very clean city. There are minimal garbage/trash bins around, yet no rubbish on the streets. There are limited seating availability in most places, and super markets are few and far between in Ginza. The Tokyo Metro train network is amazing and second to none in the world, Hong Kong would come a close second. There is no real city centre, with many 'centres' around the city. If I return to Tokyo I will be staying in Shibuya, Shinjuku or Harajuku. These places are more affordable middle of the road shopping and restaurants and take out. Restaurant consist of eels, Octopus, tofu, cold udon noodels, miso soup and of course sushi.Japanese people are very polite and courteous. Manners is something that Japanese people have embraced and it reflects in their culture and way of life. You always feel welcome and accommodated for here in Japan. Our hotel is fantasic and right next to Higashi-Ginza station. An elevator ride to the street and you are only steps away from the hotel entrance. Staff made us feel very welcome and have accommodated us with directions, suggestions for food and shopping. The hotel itself is only a few blocks away from the main highend shopping area, yet far enough away not to be caught up in the hustle and bustle of the crowded streets. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are wanting to stay in Ginza. Bring your credit cards though...you'll need them!"

When we decided to stay in Ginza, my wife's wanted to go shopping, but as we explored the shopping areas, we found so much more. We found many quiet neighborhoods with fabulous local food, and beautiful corporate buildings such as the Sony Building. We even saw a local parade walking down a main road.But the local food was not what I expected, it was a wonderful surprise. We had two days of eating local food for both lunch and dinner since we enjoyed the flavors of these small restaurants. We had delicious grilled beef and vegetables, flavorful soups (much different taste than just ramen), but our favorite was local fish grilled to perfection and the meat peeled right off the bones....sooo good! So when you go to Ginza, either ask your hotel concierge for directions to local food areas, or just go exploring!!"

Get off at Ginza station and you will come up to the busy cross \"dori\". Use certain stores as landmark on your Google map or any map to get your bearings. It is a good idea to plan ahead of time what places you want to stop while you are here. But if you don't have anything specific, don't forget to branch off into the side streets. Although Ginza is known for international high end brands, there are many unique stores and boutiques to browse and shop as well. The famous stationery store Itoya has a nice spot where you can sit and people watch from above. You can find fancy restaurants but there are still set meals for reasonable prices. Tea shops with tastings, Japanese sweets, fine department stores, Sony building, Shiseido flagship store, kabuki theatre, etc. Lots to see and do.You can easily spend the whole day here.

I found some of the surrounding areas much more worthwhile. If you're touring Tokyo, exit at the Ginza station and start exploring --you'll pass through relatively quickly on to your next discovery in the surrounding areas!"

Clerks in the shops were very friendly and helpful, and most spoke English which was very helpful, especially if you were looking for specific items. While we were there a sound truck, resplendent with the Imperial Japanese flag from days gone by, went by. We were told this was operated by a right wing group who want to re militarize Japan.

It is just a pleasure to walk around it. It is mainly visited by wealthy and elegant Japanese people. The service is impeccable. Of course, it is expensive. There are several places to see: the San\"ai building which is made of glass, the Mitsukoshi department store which is glamorous and sells beautiful kimonos, Wako, Mikimoto, and Printemps. Walking through Sotobori-Dori was quite relaxing and on this street we found a nice caf\u00e9 where we had a delicious ice cream.

We saw the beautiful Imperial Hotel, partly designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. This was a personal highlight for me. The shopping area is a hotbed of luxury, with many high-end department stores and boutiques. Not many tourists around, maybe just the serious shoppers. Don't expect street food or vending machines here either, I imagine Ginza shoppers would sit for their wine."

I did a little window shopping before quietly moving onto my next location. If you have the money, I would suggest visiting Ginza. It was unlike any other location I have seen in Asia with the high quantity of luxury shops there. If you do not have the money, it is best to visit other locations. Japan and Asia overall have many luxury shops, so it won't be hard to find many of the same items in a different and possibly cheaper location."

There was an excellent travel shop on the fifth floor of Itoya where I found some collapsible water bottles for 1200 yen, a wonderful tool for any traveler!Ginza's shopping isn't necessarily any better than other high-brand districts of the world, but it's an experience to see in Tokyo along with the Japanese who shop here; it's fairly ritzy.

Side streets also lovely with the architecturally amazing De Beers building. Even if you're no shopper, you can still enjoy a few hours here. Can be very busy"

I suspect the prices for luxury goods are higher than in the west than in Japan. Locals mentioned that discount stores are coming up as the economy is cooling. There are many upscale restaurants to experience too. My budget was too low for me to experience but Ginza is a great window shopping event and crime is non-existent as in most of Japan. There is no necessity to worry about touts, scamsters, pick pockets as in other parts of the world. Petty crime seemed rare here and very secure."

There are many places to eat but they're also high-end and pricey there are not any places quite suitable for the little ones. We did find a beer hall which the food was enjoyable, but oily. It was a historic beer hall though !We did take in a fantastic foot massage over at Queens day. That was right at the entrance of Ginza.That was wonderful considering our feet retired after a week of walking around Tokyo.Ginza is a thief he must visit but I would not make a day of it.

Before I go on:If you want to spend some major yen and you are a FOREIGNER, PLEASE BRING YOUR PASSPORT! YES, BRING YOUR PASSPORT! You will get TAX-FREE SHOPPING at most of the big stores listed below. So, HAPPY SHOPPING!!! As for restaurants, some are pricey, but the quality justifies the price. Nevertheless, don't go overboard. Spend within your means. Have a great time!TIP- Each Saturday and Sunday, from 12:00 noon until 5:00 pm, the main street through Ginza is closed traffic. This is called Hok\u014dsha Tengoku (\u6b69\u884c\u8005\u5929\u56fd?) or Hokoten for short, literally meaning \"pedestrian heaven\". I love this. NO cars. No people blocking your way. You can stop, enjoy the scenery and take pictures without blocking other people. VERY NICE!Here is a brief list of stores you can find in this district. You will recognize some names with international reputations and learn some names that are famous only in Japan. I recommend a sampling of each. I enjoy the Japanese department stores the most- you get a view into what Japanese people like and get a sampling of their very high expectations from clothing to household items to food items (vegetables, fruits, meats).

I stopped on the way back to the Vegas through L.A. after my brother in law's first memorial service. After checked out the hotel and left the bags till 8:20 pm or so, nearby went Tsukiji Fish market, and bought only in Japan products(we pay some of the daily use consumable products at approx. 4 time of Tokyo) at discount stores,I knew I will run into the crowd by the Chinese New Year, but it was bulls eye. Anywhere I went, the bus loads of them are. I wanted a bottle of supplement at the drug store but it turned out to be a 20 minutes challenge to find the store clerk. I grew up in Tokyo but this never happened till 5 years ago.Their habit of shopping is called \"Bakugai\" or impulsive shopping.It used to be a rice cooker, then the automatic toilet seat(wash and dry your bottom - used by many Hollywood celebs), shifted to cosmetics, meds. -many occasions their friends and relatives money to buy those bring back for them or pitch in and buy a lot then later sold them for profit, the proceeds are shared).It is Tokyo, so the cup of coffee at the Dotor Coffee ( inexpensive coffee house in Japan) costed some like US$4."

I find myself here every time I visit Tokyo, which is 4-5x a year, not only for the shopping, but also because it probably has the most agglomeration of top-quality Japanese restaurants, whether Michelin-starred or highly-rated on Tripadvisor. To be sure, check out Google map before heading to these restaurants as they are usually difficult to find and even the locals likely not be able to help you. I've found Google satellite to be very useful as it would show me landmark buildings that I am already familiar and I use those as starting points. I invariably check out sales of pre-loved luxury items on Komehyo and Brand Off. If you're into all sorts of inexpensive trinkets and gadgets, there's a huge Don Quijote store beside Mitsui Garden Ginza Premier. For dessert, I always stop by Manneken near the Giorgio Armani building or, if I have more time, I have coffee at Laduree in the Mitsukoshi building, watching people on the Ginza crossing. For more authentic and inexpensive sushi, you can walk two blocks to Tsukiji and from that corner, alone, there are probably at least three Sushizanmai stores, one of the most popular among Tokyoites."

Ginza is a east meets wests shopping hub where you will be able to find the European luxury brands Chanel, Prada, Gucci, MCM and many more. Go for Japanese international brands how about shiseido, Uniqlo there were a big store in Ginza. If you are into fashion and like to explore, learning 2016 Spring style, the colours, the trend, not difficult to find some designer products ONLY available in Japan. They may not necessary be expensive. My special recommendation this trip for Ginza. The Shiseido building. If you think shiseido only sell cosmetics that was wrong. Opposite to the big cosmetic shops. There was a beautiful shiseido pastry shop, there were biscuits, chocolates, take away coffee, Shiseido restaurant instant curry, princess jelly drinks for \u00a5375. Grabbed some souvenirs for my friends. Within Shiseido Parlour has 10 stories of restaurants. We try the Italian restaurant on the 10/F , Faro with elegant decorations and good food, a set lunch around USD30 with 4 courses meal great value. Will try other floors next time when we return. There were 2 department stores in Ginza Matsuya and Mitsukoshi. Where you can get tax refund straight away after shopping. With depreciation of \u00a5 Tokyo definitely a good place to shop and eat !!"

There are also 2 major department store along the strip namely Mastuya and Mitsukoshi and at the end of it is the Hakuhinkan Toy Park."

As a tourist, you can also avail of the tax free items if you spend at least 10000 yen.I found a cheap Japanese restaurant that serves very good udon and ground beef with rice. For 520 yen, you get all of those. I didn't get the chance to get the name of the restaurant but I can definitely identify it it again from the logo and the characters when I visit next time.Despite of Ginza having a reputation of a high-end, '5th ave'-ish shopping district, there are affordable items and reasonably priced stuff for everyone to enjoy."

Late-afternoon and into the evening, during the road closure, are the best times to enjoy Ginza. The main street \u2013 Chuo Dori \u2013 closes to vehicular traffic on weekend afternoons (12noon to 5pm) and up to 8pm on Sundays.Note: Refer recommendations below including spots to view passing Shinkansens.A caveat: Ginza is Tokyo\u2019s premier upmarket shopping and dining district, and we are hardly people who shop at the likes of Bvlgari and Cartier, or dine at Michelin restaurants.A warning: Be prepared for Ginza\u2019s infamous $10 cups of coffee.The best way to see Ginza is to first walk the length of the Chuo Dori road closure before winding into the other streets. This is an area which encompasses the world-famous Ginza Wako building. It was a tremendous experience just absorbing the delightful street lights, signage and watching shoppers. In fact, we only stepped into one retail store! It was quite a surreal experience walking in the middle of the street without vehicles.Highlights: Ginza Wako Building, Bvlgari building, street lights, cityscape.My recommendation is to arrive by way of Shimbashi (aka Shinbashi) Station \u2013 one of oldest train stations in Tokyo and a few leisurely minutes walk to the southern end of Chuo Dori. Then end your evening near the Yurakucho Station, which is the more economical area for your evening meal or supper.Recommendation 1: Great places to view Shinkansens are - (a) in the shopping centre outdoor plaza area east of Yurakucho Station - the first station out of Tokyo Central; and (b) on the Yurakucho Station Yamanote line platform. Shinkansens go by \u2013 literally - every 3 minutes. Recommendation 2: In combination with the above, visit the Shiodome and Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s \u2018NI-TELE Really Big Clock\u2019 at 2:50pm before starting up the Chuo Dori. The clock wind up hours are 10am, 12noon, 3pm, 6pm and 8pm. Important: Be there a few minutes before as the animated show starts about 4 minutes before the hour and ends on the hour!Enjoy Japan!Thanks for reading this review and my gratitude if you choose to rate it as helpful. No pressure though. Cheers!"

It was Autumn so it was comfortable and cool.The main shopping street is a pedestrian street until 5pm or so. This is basically where the high end shopping for Tokyo is located. There are a few things that really stands out for me:1) There are a LOT of good restaurants in or around Ginza. Head to the basement of the train station and you have several famous Michelin Star restaurants innocuously tucked in a corner, including what is Japan's most famous 3-star sushi restaurant, Sukiyabashi Jiro. If paying top dollar is not your thing, you can walk to a street of yakitori (bbq chicken on sticks) shops nearby. We couldn't get a reservation at Jiro's (we're not japanese) and so we had more fun at the Yakitori shops.2) They have 11 floors of Uniqlo! And they stock plus sizes for womens and menswear! You don't have to be stick thin to buy the good quality thermal wear at this branch.3) They have Shiseido.... Bakery. Most people, women in particular, know of Shiseido as a famous japanese cosmetics brand favored by many people in Asia. In Ginza, there is a Shiseido bakery / patisserie. It's worth a look."

Has Japanese specialties, has prepacked lunches. There are high end stores, but also a department store that had very practical clothing items at very cheap prices. Also could get tax-free if spent around $100. There are many restaurants and many people. All in all it's pleasant for walking and people watching."

I had been to Ginza before, but seeing the effervescence of this city at Christmastime through my son's eyes was amazing. GINZA glitters...apparently the name means \u2018place where silver is minted\u2019. Go at night! Its like no other spot on the planet\u2026crazy neon lights, videos blaring from giant screens on skyscrapers...add giant Christmas trees and displays to that and you\u2019ve got an iconic explosion of what one would expect from Tokyo.Ginza is filled with high-end stores from all over the world. I personally don\u2019t care about Tiffany and Shiseido and Mikimoto \u2013 BUT I do lust after Ito-ya. Ito-ya is floor after floor of handmade papers, and pens and stationary and art supplies. Ginza is also filled with Department Stores (known as DEPATO). Here\u2019s one major reason why the Tokyo DEPATO are cool: The food courts...basement mini-food-kingdoms I suggest going to the food court in the Mistukoshi department store...open since the 1600s!"

You've got department stores like Mitsukoshi, Matsuya and the grand dame of them all, Wako. Let's not forget all the brand shops lining Ginza dori. Personally, my favourite is the stationary shop, Ito-ya. If you're a fan of fountain pens, go through the main store to the back, across the street to the \"K\" building and then up to the 2nd floor to their pen showcase. Fantastic!Weekends are interesting because the main road is shut down to vehicle traffic and the street becomes one long area to people watch. Great for photography as you'll see a mix of real characters as well as people out dressed in their finest fashion. Oh, there's also free wi-fi all along Ginza dori so if you really need to get a text out, or you're updating your instagram, it's very convenient. Step away from the main drag and explore the streets running parallel to Ginza dori and you'll encounter some interesting little shops and eateries. The side toward the Imperial Palace is still pretty high-end until you reach Yurakucho but head the other direction, toward the water, and it becomes decidedly more middle-class; this isn't a bad thing. You'll see that the area of Ginza is far more than just high-end shops."

There is an hourly bus from Narita Airport and it will drop you at Sukiabashi corner, the entrance to the suburb and within walking distance to any hotel you choose. It is also home to Sukiabashi Jiro, known as the best Sushi restaurant in the world and the most difficult to get a dinner reservation. Historic Ginza has always been a major art, entertainment, commercial and restaurant centre for residents of Tokyo and was rebuilt after fires caused by the 1923 earthquake destroyed most of the then wooden shops and buildings.

There are some fantastic restaurants and the service and politeness of all staff no matter what type of business you enter is absolutely the best ,I would say in the world. Yes some places are expensive but the product is top shelf, sure there are some very expensive places to eat but we have found that comparing such with such it is no dearer than back home , in plenty of places cheaper and of course in this part of the world there are more Michellin Star Restaurant than any where else on the planet. I do believe it is the dearest real estate in Tokyo and probably the world.It is nice on the weekends, both days I think ,that at a certain time the main street is closed to all traffic. It is a real buzz then to see every one strolling about without a care in the world, very busy but that is normal in Japan. In some areas there are tables and chairs placed right in the middle of the road for people to do whatever they want.Ginza is not all new glitz and glamour, there are plenty of old historical places to find , some great parkland nearby and of course the Imperial Palace and it's magnificent gardens are only a few minutes walk away.I find it a great place to walk around, absolutely love it and I am not a good shopper.

As for restaurants, as my wife says \"in Ginza just add a zero to what other restaurants would charge\", but there are some good places nearby to fuel up, just a short walk away. Must visit, try for a Sunday when you don't have to battle with traffic and noise."

I only went to Matsuya & Mitsukoshi but could not believe that they were old and out-dated in decoration inside. An expensive place for food & shopping, hustle & bustle."

All the world's luxury brands can be found in Ginza and it's an excellent place to walk and browse, particularly when the main road gets closed on weekend afternoons - you get room to wander, instead of having to negotiate your way through crowds on the footpath. There are plenty of places to eat and drink - and many of them have long queues out the front. Not all the shopping is expensive - some side streets have the American chains such as Gap, which is a bonus for non Japanese shoppers because the cut of clothing is a bit more generous. One of the local food experiences is the sweets cafe Higashiya, in the Pola cosmetics building - a revelation for afternoon tea. Generally, it's a nice spot to walk although finding your way into some of the department stores can be tricky. If you get footsore, you can always head into the subway and escape."

If you're a Starbucks fan, the first Japanese Starbucks is located in Ginza. There is a nice selection of restaurants... but many of the decent ones close early leaving only the casual bar/restaurant types available to those folks suffering from jet lag (after an hour or so of looking we headed back to the hotel for room service)..

Well, every step you take will take you to different stores or different restaurants and overall it will be a nice visit. Before you come here, make sure to check the cafes inside of the shop ( most of high end brands have little cafe inside of their boutique ).

Third time in Tokyo and with friends Who are familiar I discover that Ginza is not just about the main boulevards full of upscale and branded shops. If you start to explore the areas behind the main boulevards you will discover there are a lot of eating places and nice small independent shops that sells and service with reasonable prices. I also discover nice reasonable and interesting eating places at Ginza Corridorlike midori which is one of the best sushi and Shashimi I had in Tokyo. There are many more interesting restaurants underneath the railway lines which I did not managed to try. But by the look of it very appetising and interesting. Less crowded area as compared to shinjuku or shibuya. Prices of items sold in Ginza actually the same when compared other areas in Tokyo. Love the Uniqlo flagship store there. Amazing selection and choises that you can't find anywhere else in the world. Love Ginza"

Many items may also be found online at seriously reduced prices in comparison to those found on the strip. However, if you really have qualms about spending your inheritance here, you obviously don't belong here.

Ginza is ideally based for the Tokyo Station (access to all Shinkasen/Subway & JR Lines) as well as attractions like Kabuki-Za, Tsjuki Fish Market, Imperial Palace and more.

We used the Kaisei bus going to Tokyo stn. On our return we take the Narita Access bus, using the Ginza bus stop which is very near the subway or a short taxi ride from our appartment (we used Airbnb). One of our main consideration in choosing Ginza area as our base is its proximity to Tokyo stn. From Narita airport you have 2 major option of reaching the city - subway or bus. Presently there is a promo for NEX, Y4000 two way. We did not consider this one because we anticipate the heavy luggage we'll be carrying going back not to mention we have our daughter with us. So our our only option is to take a bus, this eliminates a lot of hassles in taking the subway; 1. long queue at JR office to purchase the the NEX ticket. 2. Since Tokyo stn is so huge you'll be left with a lot of walking with your luggage in tow. Going to Tokyo stn takes 1 hr 30 mins, and upon return took us just an hour (7:30 am schedule), for only Y1000 adult, Y500 kids.Ginza area is walking distance to Tsukijji Fish market, few stops to other major tourist place around Tokyo."

You can get a pulse of the Japanese economy by strolling through Ginza as this part of Tokyo is where business, fashion and entertaiment intersect. If salarymen are out at night drinking in Ginza, then the economy is not doing too badly. When the bubble economy burst, Ginza was \"uncharacteristically deserted\" at night. Now, there is a sense of normalcy and vibe that is back.Ginza is not just all about drinking. You can walk its streets at night and marvel at the shopping windows of the big department stores like Mitsukoshi, Matzusakaya and Matsuya or the stores of fashion brands like Uniqlo. Japanese women are more fashionable in winter. They come in boots and winter wear. If you can brave the cold, sip coffee and watch them go by."

There's the Sony Centre, where you can find the latest products and gadgets, little stalls in the centre of the mall is for good quality items not so expensive, like the umbrellas (was raining whene we were there, our ponchos were no good) , stockings and hosiery, small items we were able to take back to Australia and not so heavy. There were also eateries near Ginza train station which were amazing! They look tiny but inside there is even room/baskets to put you bags, etc and coat/jacket holders! As usual, food is great and good value, service tops! Anywhere is really good- whether big or small dining places. We like to eat where locals eat and we found these eateries..just browse and it is a problem only as where to eat as most of the places are good value, just look around first.

A spin thru one of the massive Japanese department stores (e.g. Matsuya) is also fun and provides some interesting insights to Japanese culture. The icing on the cake? The same amazing Japanese politeness that you encounter everywhere is just as present in the uber-high-end stores like Gucci.

The stores reminded me of Harrods with 7-8 levels of shopping heaven!

You will get lost, but it can be a ton of fun to explore. You can go from Ginza shopping and cafe's to the movie theaters and electronics stores of Yurakucho, to the International Forum, and even the Yaesu underground shopping center and Tokyo station, without ever having to set foot out in the rain or cold!Additional interesting points from someone who used to live in Ginza:- If you want to see it crowded, head there on a weekend, where the roads are closed to traffic.- It is probably one of the worlds most pretentious areas. People will literally dress in their absolute best, and bring expensive brand bangs from home just to walk around the area for a day and look/feel rich.- Especially on a weekend, less than half the people you see walking the streets will be Japanese. Huge tourist spot (especially for visitors from China)- Chinese visitors are highly targeted by EVERY shop. I have countless Japanese friends working at shops in Ginza who all sing the same song: Our sales strategy is to get as much money as possible from rich Chinese tourists.- You can go to some of the best restaurants that Japan has to offer (if you have the cash)- The main street is interesting, but definitely hit up some of the side and back streets (there is a lot of interesting 'behind the scenes' Ginza going on there'Things to watch out for:-Unless you have the money with you, do not sit down to eat at any place that does not have prices on the menu. It can end up costing more than you would imagine.- Although uncommon, an area this crowded with many rich people tends to be an ideal spot for pickpocketing. Again; uncommon, but its always better to be safe."

I am a budget traveller and love to discover all discount items with good quality and I found out the Gotemba Premium Outlet is so much better than shopping here in Ginza. The brands is all about the same but the Gotemba offers better price especially for the Nike Brands, GAP and Coach NY. I just enjoy watching people in this area while sipping my Starbucks and I save most of my money by deciding not to buy anything.. It is just not worth to buy all this western Brands when you can buy it at your own country with the same price..save your luggage space and avoid regreting of over shopping.

We found it very interesting to visit this part of the Tokyo both during a daylight as well as in the evening when everything is even more shiny and glittering... So if you want to do some shopping well prepare a lot of money... but if you just want to take a walk and admire some architecture check your camera's batteries and go!"

However, if you want something that is distinctly Japanese like I did then look elsewhere.Having it's own subway stop - Ginza station - on the Tokyo Metro and only 2 stations away from Tokyo station, the area is centrally located and easy to get to. The streets are filled with the typical high-end brand name stores from across the world and everywhere you look restaurants, bars, and clubs providing a decent nightlife scene. Be sure to look up and down as every floor or basement can contain a store or club you might miss. It's a nice place to walk to kill some time, do some window shopping, and just see the night lights.Honestly though, there isn't anything here that you wouldn't see in a city like New York or the streets of Hong Kong. If you're making a trip from a different country to visit Japan, I would advise you to spend your time somewhere else to experience something uniquely Japanese.As an aside, if you do find yourself here and want food, check out Umegaoka Sushi no Midori Sohonten (do a Google search with that full name). It's a sushi restaurant with some pretty amazing set meals for great prices. It should be easy to spot, as it's under the train track and there always seems to be a line out the door - be ready to wait ~20-30 minutes to get inside. Just use the machine in front of the entrance to make a reservation and take your ticket. Sit, strike up a conversation with your neighbor, and prepare yourself for some awesome sushi."

Ginza (\u9280\u5ea7, \u304e\u3093\u3056) is one of the world\u2019s most famous shopping areas, like Fifth Avenue in New York and Avenue Montaigne in Paris. Ginza is a district located in the Chuo, Tokyo. Ginza was a swamp in the 16th century. During the Edo period, the government established the silver-coin mint (Ginza means \"silver mint\" in Japanese) in 1612. Since then, people have called the district Ginza. After a serious fire in 1872, the Meiji government had chosen Ginza as the \"model of modernization\u201d and started using brick instead of wood to make buildings fireproof. Because of that, Ginza was criticized to look more like western city rather than traditional Japanese, Edo style city. Today, most of the western style buildings were dismantled and only a few are left. The most famous is the Wak\u014d building with its Hattori Clock Tower. There is a well-supported policy in the Ginza area that set a building height limit for the Ginza commercial area at 56 meters in 1998. You can enjoy a comfortable atmosphere when you walk down the streets. Ginza is one of the most expensive real estate areas in Japan \u2013 1 m2 (11 ft2) of land can easily cost you over 10 million yen (US$ 93,200). We stayed at Hotel Monterey Lasoeur Ginza right in the center of Ginza. It takes only few minutes to walk to the Ginza main street (Chuo Dori Street). The Ginza main street covers from Ginza 1-chome to Ginza 8-chome (\u9280\u5ea71\u4e01\u76ee ~ \u9280\u5ea78\u4e01\u76ee). We were there on a Sunday afternoon, and we were surprised to find that the main street was closed to traffic and had become a large pedestrian zone. The street closure started from 12:00 to 17:00 on weekends. It was an unusual experience where we could walk on the usually busy traffic road. I certainly wasted no time in taking photos of those beautiful shops with ease. Ginza is Tokyo\u2019s most well-known upscale shopping, dining, and entertainment area. We saw many big-name department stores, world famous designer boutiques, unique stores, art galleries, clubs, and restaurants. We all know that Tokyo is one of the top 10 most expensive cities in the world. The price tag on most of the merchandise, even regular bread, is very expensive. Personally, I like the window shopping after the stores are closed. The window displays at each store are very creative, and I can take photos without the interruption of people passing by. If you are tired of eating food at restaurants, you can try the bento (food box) and readily cooked foods which you can take away with a very attractive discount on the basement of Ginza Mitsukoshi Department Store before they close at 8:00 pm.The best way to visit the Ginza is by taking the Hibiya, Marunouchi or Ginza Subway Lines to the Ginza Station."

The Ginza is Tokyo's most famous upmarket shopping, dining and entertainment district, featuring numerous department stores, boutiques, art galleries, restaurants, night clubs and cafes.One square meter of land in the district's center is worth over ten million yen, making it one of the most expensive real estate in Japan. It is where you can find the infamous $10 cups of coffee and where virtually every leading brand name in fashion and cosmetics has a presence.Most shops in the Ginza district are open every day of the week. A visit is most pleasant on weekend afternoons when the central Chuo Dori street is closed to automobile traffic and become a large pedestrian zone. The road closure takes place from 12:00 to 17:00 (until 18:00 from April through September).The most convenient stations for accessing the Ginza district are Ginza Station on the Hibiya, Marunouchi and Ginza Subway Lines and Yurakucho Station on the JR Yamanote Line, JR Keihin-Tohoku Line and Yurakucho Subway Line."

Ginza have all these name brand shops where it seems only the wealthy mainland Chinese can afford to shop but for a poor salaryman like me, there are two reasons to come to the Ginza!They're called Uniqlo and their cheaper cousin, GU! Only 100 metres from the A2 exit at the Ginza station and you'll find reasonably priced good clothing!This Ginza store is their largest in the world and is 11 stories! Just down the road back towards the subway is GU, recently opened with prices a little cheaper and I bought a pseudo green leather jacket for 5000 JPY here. Unless you're absolutely loaded, just make a bee-line for these two shops, you won't be able to push the Chinese shoppers with wallets full of cash out of the way in the other stores! Have fun and buy a lightweight down jacket at Uniqlo for 5000 JPY! I bought three as I can never make up my mind what colour I like best! Oh, saving the best for last, if you're a gaijin (foreigner), take your passport to GU as they'll give you 5% off! Happy shopping!"

Don't expect too many bargains, although I was surprised when my wife returned last weekend with bags full of bargain kid's clothes she bought at a H&M sale. The main strip, Chuo St, has some high-end eateries and tea houses where you can see well-heeled ladies cooling their heels and comparing their purchases. Don't be surprised if you see small groups of local girls or couples in traditional Japanese dress or elegant older folk strolling the boulevard. It has a less pretentious vibe than many of its' contemporaries in other countries, it seems the shoppers here haven't lost sight of the need to have fun.

Shopping at Ginza is not cheap but you can be assured the products have been tastefully edited-- so much temptations--simply cakes & cookies are presented in crafted packaging. We enjoy the food basement of the department stores at Ginza, from food gift treats to take outs (after 7pm watch out for 20-30% discounts on take out food items). Thee was a MOMA (museum of modern art) souvenir shop at the corner where there is Sony showroom -- I enjoy museum souvenir shop -sometimes more than the museum. You can acquire your Issey Miyake designer BaiBai shopping bag here. Tokyo is no longer the world's most expensive capital city- it now belongs to Singapore. $100 a nite hotels are now easily found throughout Agoda or Booking.com . Dining in Tokyo can be affordable --especially breakfast & lunch where the bento box (set lunch) are at promotional prices. You have great food and good shopping that awaits you in Japan :-)"

It's a vegetarian restaurant, which is hard to find in Tokyo, and it has a great atmosphere as well as delicious food! I'd highly recommend it to anyone going through the Ginza area."

There are fashion stores and department stores with various levels of shopping budgets in mind. A short stroll and you can also visit the Kabuki Theatre on the edge of Ginza, even if you are not attending a show the actual Kabuki Theatre is something to behold.Back in the main area of Ginza you can shop for just about anything, so take your time and enjoy. Yes, you can see high end designer stores at many places through Japan and indeed the rest of the world, but Ginza has an atmosphere all of it's own. If you are there end November, to Christmas make sure you take a walk through Ginza's main shopping area early evening/night to experience the magnificent lights that bring an amazing spirit of festivity to the area."

I can't remember which one, but one or two of the food departments were the biggest that I saw in Japan (I believe it was Matsuya), where there's endless row after row, stall after stall of food for sale, especially Japanese sweets. This included the grocery stores and take out food places There are also plenty of food options on the upper floors of the department stores as well.The bright lights and people present were an attraction as well. The most picturesque is the corner where Wako and Mitsukoshi department stores are located. Again, I wish I had more time to spend here."

Yes, there are a lot of high end stores and that is interesting.....but the really interesting part is how the Japanese present the stuff. Everything is beautiful - they must so much work into the presentation, it is basically art. Even the food looks like it is in museum display.Very cool area - highly recommend."

Most things were triple the price of what I would pay in the U.S. For example: $50 for a shirt at GAP that would be $15 in the states..However, there were a few stores that had decent prices. Ladies, for a quick lunch and desert I recommend a tea cafe called Darjeeling Room inside one of the plazas that I missed the name. For around 1,100 yen you can get a pretty nice meal and a great people-watching experience. All in all, if you don't have a limit, shop till you drop and enjoy. Absolutely loving Tokyo!"

I've been to Japan four times now and Japanese department stores never cease to amaze me. All of them are at least half a block/one block long which puts most U.S. department stores to shame! The only ones that I could compare are the Macys in NYC and SF but those are just the main branches. Outside of the major cities, Macys can be some little podunk outpost that wouldn't even fit in one floor of a Japanese department store. Also, Japanese stores are TRUE department stores with departments for electronics, toys, stationary, golf and other very, very specialized wares. For example, in Mitsukoshi they have a section in the men's department for cigars, lighters and other smoking paraphernalia. Toys in a U.S. department store? Golf? stationary? ha ha! Don't make me laugh! Stores in the U.S. don't even deserve to be called department stores anymore. When you go to a Japanese store, their sheer size inspires awe and grandeur - it's what shopping used to be in the major cities in the U.S. before the advent of the suburban malls. Another thing to experience is the Japanese focus on service, respect, and detail. When they open the store, UNIFORMED salesmen/ladies will greet and bow the first customers for the day. This may continue as you ascend each floor (as I experienced at Tobu Department store - they had personnel greet me on EVERY floor as I was going up the escalator). I will say that the prices are a little high but you can get bargains if you go during the sale season and even if you don't buy anything, you can always find bargains in the basement food court OR peruse the many restaurants that are usually in the top floors. I'm sure you'll find something within your budget."

It was a very hot September day so large umbrellas had been placed in the middle of the traffic-free street for people to sit under to catch their breath. People watching is good on Ginza. People on odd looking bicycles ..wearing outlandish clothes/hats ... with their pets all out for show rather than for the exercise etc. The Department store basement floors specialising in food were a delight to visit, even if only to try what is on offer. All in all, if you 'look' around you, you will find lots to see and experience in Ginza. Shopping isn't the end-all after all!

Locals and tourists take advantage of a traffic free shopping area and many cultural and entertaining activities take place.

The Department stores, especially Floors B1 and B2 (if you like your food) are amazing as are the window displays.

A while ago, I heard from a colleague of mine's that Ginza is \"the shopping mecca of the world.\" And to this day that statement remains true. I actually research the Ginza district of Tokyo before I made my first, and so far only, trip to Japan. Finally when I step foot in Ginza, this place is like none other place(s) I've ever seen before. Ginza is a very large shopping area. I think it would take an whole week just to shop at every shop for those who is obsess with shopping. I must admit even I was drawn into this mystical area. Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to shop because I went with a tour group, but let just me say, I was really amazed with what was offered in those shops. I saw many things, from souvenirs to antiques, that I didn't see in America or even Canada (my home country). On top of that, Ginza have many different restaurants that serves good food. I had great Chinese food one day and Brazilian BBQ the next day. I believe Ginza is home to the International Cuisine scene in Japan. But of course, on the downside, every thing in Japan is so expensive. It always makes me ponder how can people live in Japan with the cost of living so high? Anyways, to sum it all up, Ginza is a great place to visit, especially if it's your first time there. The prices may be high, but it is definitely worth a trip to see what is it like on the other side of the world."

They block off the main street through Ginza such that you can just walk down the middle of the street to easily go back and forth. They also place seats in the middle to rest and people watch.

You are better off in the small streets of shibuya or ebisu. Talking about food, go to the basements of some of these department stores where they have the myriad of food available.

Most buildings and shops are named Ginza ........something . I went in the morning , evening n night - same atmosphere - nothing special. If you want to buy a LV bag or a Prada shoes or a Dunhill Jacket , might as well buy it in London or Singapore or if I have the cash to spend , i will buy them in my hometown , Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.( maybe cheaper ) .BUT for Muslim travellers - good news , there is a halal restaurant ( after 6 days in Tokyo , this is the only halal restaurant I found ) Its called RASA MALAYSIA ( from my country ofcourse ) Both the cooks are from Wangsa Maju and Pandan , KL . The chinese lady waitress , Ms.Tin is also a Malaysian .They serve the normal Malaysian food .( of course 5 times the price compared to KL ) .Location - Look out for Masukaya and UNI Glo shopping centre , besides the trafic lights , a building called Ginza 5 Star ( but no signage ) ground floor is MIZUHO Bank , go to the side entrance , take the lift to the 9th floor ( 7th floor is an Indian restaurant ) the sign board is very very small .I think the Japanese do not encouraged ' outsiders ' to do business in their country."

Ginza is the premiere shopping street of Tokyo, a little of Fifth Avenue, a little suburban chain mall (Gap, Abercrombie and Fitch, Forever 21, Uniqlo), a little manga, a little kimono. We came on a Sunday when streets are blocked to traffic. There are picnic umbrellas and park benches set helpfully in the traffic median, for those like us who would gawk at leisure at the variety of humanity passing by. Not only the fashionista Japanese (honestly, there were grandmothers in 4 inch heels, leather pants, halter tops, hair dyed blonde), ladies with their Gucci and Chanel outfits and bags, but also kids dressed like manga characters, or in cosplay outfits with makeup and hair to match. It was all really fantastic. There were shops to delight the eye and empty the wallet. There was a spanking white Apple store for all the fangirls and fanboys. There was a two-story store devoted to all things Hello Kitty (Lunchbox? Check. Chopsticks? Check. Lip gloss? Check. Head to toe outfit? Check. Four-foot plush toy? Check). There are fancy bakeries selling mochi, the glutinous rice cakes with sweets inside, for $5 a pop. There are sushi and steak joints. There are department stores with beautiful girls greeting you at the door. The department stores, like many in Asia, have cavernous basements with gigantic food courts and sometimes even whole grocery stores, like a Stop and Shop under a Nordstrom, except all the food looks beautifully dressed and will be wrapped in two boxes before you get to eat it. At the Mitsukoshi department store, we saw a loaf of bread for 20,000 Y. This gives you an idea of the kind of prices at Ginza.We came to a Shabu Shabu restaurant for dinner and were not disappointed. All you can eat shabushabu with three different meats and tofu, vegetables. And a taro popsicle at the end. All that window shopping gives one an appetite."

Ginza, within walking distance from Tokyo Station, is one of the big three shopping and entertainment areas in Tokyo along with Shinjuku and Shibuya. Like the other two areas, Ginza comes alive at night with streets lined with neon and buildings competing with each other for the prize of 'most unique and most opulent architecture' award! My personal favourite is the Chanel building with its LED facade which encompasses the entire front side of the building and displays some very interesting video images at night. Of course being one of the world's foremost fashion addresses means you'll see all of the major international fashion brands housed here. There are plenty of shopping opportunities and many restaurants and cafes to choose from. The main street is closed off to traffic on Sunday afternoons."

I highly recommend visiting the Food Halls (usually found in the basement level), where you can see the most beautifully presented food you've ever seen, taste some samples and grab a delectable snack! Unfortunately not many of them actually have seating areas. Also, check out the store guides, and go to the floor selling homewares, 'gifts' and kimono - these three are usually grouped together, and it was a great insight into what people have in their homes, typical wedding gifts, traditional products such as ceramics and woodware (these items are set out as if on display in an art gallery - amazing!) and kimono and other traditional products. Even my partner enjoyed it (particularly the amazing Japanese kitchen knives). Some of the department stores have been in operation since the 1600s, and their level of service is out of this world!"

If you want to have a quick look, go to Mitsukoshi at the big junction, which has a great food hall. Divided into two floors, B2F has cake shops and delicatessens, and on B3F, quality fish and meat are found. Fish are particularly good, though very expensive, and so are poultry. If you are more into fashion, go to Matsuya Ginza where most brand boutiques are located. If you cannot find what you fancy, you could ask shop assistants who might direct you to another boutique in the area. There are lots of small traditional shops too.

No visit to Ginza is complete without stopping by Muji's flagship store, the largest in Tokyo, Apple's Japanese flagship store and the Sony showroom. Muji in Ginza is so large that in addition to the usual apparel, food items, furniture and other household products, it features an optical shop (with great spectacle designs) and a mobile house department (yes, you heard right, fancy buying a Muji home anyone?). The Apple and Sony stores are just as impressive, if you're a technophile. Fashionistas will also get to shop till they drop with the endless streets of branded shops and department stores housed in interesting buildings in Ginza. All in, Ginza makes for a fun half day out.

However, if you go on the weekend, it is a totally different experience. All day Saturday the main streets of the Ginza are closed to traffic and it becomes for pedestrians only. It really makes it a much easier experience. Try to be in front of Mitshukoshi department store (Ginza line stop 9) just before 10:00 am. They come out, and do a little \"store opening ceremony\" every day at 10:00 am. My favorite stores are Mitshukoshi (check out the housewares department for some good things to take home). Also go upstairs where you will find several restaurants that are great. If you enjoy the French cafe, Laduree, and their wonderful macaroons, there is one right in Mitshukoshi, over-looking the most famous intersection in the Ginza. Matsuya is another favorite department store. Check out the basement floors of each of these stores. They are food floors with amazing Japanese food to take to the park, or hotel to try. It is like walking through the food halls in Harrods in London ! Matsuya is just down the street from Mitshukoshi. Further down the street is an amazing stationary store, unlike any in the States, called Itoya. Across the street from Matsuya, is the Apple Store, which is a great place to visit if you need to check your email. After the Apple store, go 1 block further, and turn left. Cross 2 or 3 small blocks and on your left will another favorite department store. It is called Printemps and is from Paris. The Japanese love all things French. And as you can see from my notes, I do too. This store is great for up to date fashions and good prices. In the summer they even have the \"summer sale\" in July, just like the Paris store. I am actually not much of a shopper. But when friends come to town, this is where I take them. Enjoy !"

Otherwise, if you're looking for culture/nature in your trip, it's ok to give this place a miss.Duration-wise, plan at around 2 hours if you only intend to walk around and visit only a handful of boutiques. If you intend to visit every other shop, Ginza can easily take you up to an entire day.Good Points:- Central place for luxury shoppers- Easily accessible via multiple metro linesBad Points:- Not much to see other than luxury good stores, so don't bother if you're not into luxury shopping- Might burn a big hole in your pocket ;)"

Ginza is well-known for its expensive department stores and brand storefronts, but there's more to the neighborhood than over-priced shopping. When Japan opened up to the West, Ginza was designed to look like a Western boulevard, and so the main street through the neighborhood was substantially wider than normal Tokyo streets back when it was constructed. If you visit on a Sunday when the main drag is open to only foot traffic, you can appreciate how huge this would have felt back in the days before everyone drove cars.Today, you can find restaurants (both expensive and cheap) as well as some prefectural goods stores -- these are run by each of Japan's prefectures and sell famous foods and handicrafts from each region. Even if your trip doesn't take you out of Tokyo, prefectural stores are one way to get a flavor of Japan's other regions.There are also some Japanese brand showrooms, including Sony's multi-level electronic tower. If you find Shibuya and Shinjuku daunting (or find the crowds claustrophobic), Ginza is a more sedate area of downtown Tokyo. It doesn't have as much energy, perhaps, as the areas where more young people hang out... But you're also less likely to get squashed or trampled."

After seeing the cherry blossoms , the imperial palace , numerous shrines and temples , tall buidings and markets , we felt we had missed something of Tokyo so we went to Ginza after dark .  Boy , is this a different Tokyo ! We have been in Times Square , the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es , the Magnificent Mile in Chicago , and we think that Ginza is the best for window-shopping , neon publicity and advertising ! It is really worth spending 3 to 4 hours wandering around , getting the pulse of the crowds and stop by for a drink or food at one or more of the numerous restaurants available ! A different and still surprising Tokyo altogether !"

The main streets remain intact from the Edo era. After the Meiji Restoration, the Western-style buildings made of bricks and stones were constructed in 1873-1877, but they were destroyed by the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923. Many of the buildings are from the late 1920s and 1930s, when the \"MoBos\" and \"MoGas\" enjoyed shopping and frequented coffee shops and bars in the area. After WW2, Ginza retained the status of being the most prestigious district of consumerism, although new shopping districts in Shinjuku and Shibuya developed. The Japanese take much pride in having a store in Ginza, and you'll see why after your visit.Ginza is generally an upscale shopping/dining district, but it can be a family friendly place, with chains like Uniqlo and Tokyu Hands that co-exist with Prada and Louis Vuitton. The competition among department stores (Mitsukoshi, Matsuya, Matsuzakaya, etc) are fierce. Their basement floors begin sales after 19:00 to sell off all the food imaginable in this world. Very worth visiting if you like window-shopping in a neat and relaxing area.  ."

I got the train to Tokyo station, figuring if any action was happening it would be in the heart of the city. Coming out of the station there were Christmas trees and lights everywhere, a magical place. It was freezing cold with icy winds gusting down the streets, but there were forever little pockets of warmth inside shops, each of which had their own Christmas tree decorated to perfection.This stretches all the way from Tokyo station into Ginza. Such a beautiful neighbourhood with lights and excitement wherever you look. Best place to be on Christmas night - just don't forget your winter woolies!"

People go here to spend money, not save it. Eating can be expensive, but there are bargains to be had at any of the \"Ginza Lion\" beer halls which are foreigner friendly. So why go here? Well because all the beautiful people do. On Sundays they close down the street and tens of thousands walk up and down the street dressed in their best window shopping and having $10 cups of coffee. The back streets are interesting to take a look at. Lots of oddball shops and 1000's of bars and clubs. I actually go here often. It's more of the \"adult\" place to go, and not really for the kids.

More luxury stores per square mile than most anywhere in the world. On the other hand, the prices are higher than most anywhere in the world, especially for US travelers with the current yen dollar exchange rate.Great selection of restaurants also.I love to just walk around this area and take in the sights- window shopping, stopping to eat, watching the beautiful people (including some women wearing kimonos on weekends) walking down the street, seeing the beautiful cars driving by.... Other than eating, I tend to keep my wallet in my pocket though. Most of the luxury goods are available in US cities at lower prices."

There are many other things such as department stores which appeal to the everyday person. PROS************************************************************** A good place for western brands (if you fit)* Friendliest staff I encountered in Tokyo* Toy Park is a great place for gifts for all ages* Many department stores* Great for walking* Sapporo beer brewery* Window displays are a work of art themselves*Great train line which is close to everythingCONS************************************************************** Expensive* Many department stores* It is easy to get lost - Japanese people have no sense of direction and the rule of thumb is usually * Hard to find a map unless you get one from department stores* English speaking of some staff is so-so - you need to know basic Japanese if you want something specific like I did."

You would find any day, both Japanese Traditional Riches and Asian New Rich are strolling to the 'Extravagant ' Shops. However, Ginza also home for younger people with more of heart than riches, to offer from its back road mazes with resturants, shops from around the world. What I personally recomend to spend an afternoon of Saturday or Sunday (or any holiday) of Autumn/winter or Spirnt to stroll at the main roads of Ginza. The main road is closed for vehicles and reserved for Lazy Padestrians. I often de-stress with my camera, and discover Japan each time a new way.Do try it, either with your family, friends or just alone, you are sure to hit some treasure.."

Although I was not there to shop, this is perfect for anyone looking to do some serious shopping, with the Apple store, Tiffany, Bulgari and many more designer shops lining the streets.We really enjoyed seeing this side of Ginza during the day, and still managed to find a small, trendy cafe/bar to eat ramen for lunch at a low price.If you want to escape the bustle of the city, it is easy to visit the Imperial Palace Gardens, just a short walk from the train station.By night, we often sat at the street cafes under the railway arches (with the occasional Shinkansen passing by), amazing Japanases food - Yaketori, Sashimi, Gyozas - at a good price perfect if you are looking to enjoy the \"street\" side of Tokyo.From here you can go on to enjoy cocktail bars or traditional sake bars.Ginza is easy to get to from Tokyo station and you will love it whether you want to shop, sightsee, enjoy cocktails in one of the many high rises or have a beer or sake with the locals in a traditional bar, all under the amazing lights."

Very busy but in a crammed, western way and not the exciting, tokyo way like the Shinjuku. Actually, if you want to do some shopping and have fun, I recommend going to Shinjuku instead. One thing to do if you are in Ginza - go to Mikimoto. No Harrods, Selfridges, Saks can ever come close to the way they treat you in Mikimoto. And if you have some cash to spare, those pearls are close to the best thing money can buy. I recommend this attraction only if you have loads of time and patience and definitely not after a long day."

I tend to visit Tokyo for business, and stay at the Dai Ichi hotel or Dai Ichi Annex, so for me Ginza is a great place to wander around between meetings or in the evenings.Yes, the designer goods are expensive, but there are a few other places worth going...- Uniqlo for good value basics, sometimes with a quirky Japanese edge.- Muji for Japanese household goods and snacks.- Bic Camera by Yurakucho station for travel adapters if you forget yours.- Apple Mac store (top floor) for free internet access if, like me, your work laptop won't let you get to hotmail and facebook.- Printemps or Matsuya department stores for little designer hankies and flannels. (And for the loos...)- Rag Tag for second hand designer clothes - Hermes scarves for \u00a340 or so.- Cafe Doutour at the Ginza crossing to sit on the first floor and watch the world go by.So not really a destination in its own right (unless you're very rich), but a nice place to kill some time if you're travelling on business and don't want to go too far from your hotel."

I was a bit nervous about jumping right into lodging in Tokyo, a place neither of us have been to and where everything would have been an unknown and so took what I thought would be a more familiar introduction to Asia...An airport hotel, the Holiday Inn for our layover nights.This decision results in our having to take the hotel bus back to the Airport, then catch the express train to Tokyo, an expensive $100 round trip. Another weak research moment...what to do when we get to Tokyo? We fumble trying to figure out the subway, got off at Ginza station and walked around and around, each of us in hurting shoes. Neither of us are shoppers, so this may not have been the best section to explore, but we did have some interesting views, enjoyed a park, found that almost no one spoke English (at least where we were) there is no such thing as an internet cafe and we had a fantastic lunch.In our rambling about Ginza we came across a little alley way that we returned to for lunch. The restaurant had about 24 seats at 6 tables and you were sat with other folks. We watched one group of three come in and they were sat at 3 different tables. WOW!This was a locals restaurant, mostly business men. I was the only woman there. The nice thing about menus here is that almost all of them have pictures so it doesn't matter if you can't read it...just point and cross your fingers that you didn't just order something too wacky! We both chose what would have been a Binto styled meal here, but it didn't come in a box. Miso soup, rice, pork & vegetables, potstickers, and a beer for less than $20 very reasonable!We found a wine shop and picked up a good bottle and headed back to Narita. Our summary is that Tokyo was not too easy for those who don't know the language. At least the Ginza area was not trying very hard with most street signs sans-subtitles. We wish we had done more research on Tokyo to maximize our time here. A tour might have been the way to go.So on our first day we figured we had a $120 lunch. Sort of like pilots and the $100 hamburger."
