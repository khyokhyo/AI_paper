We visited the lovely Rua Garret for shopping and espresso/pastries. We also visited the Convento do Carmo which is so incredibly beautiful. From the convent you can access the Elevador de Santa Justa without waiting in the incredibly long line at the bottom. You can access Rua Augusta which runs from Parco Commercio to Parco Rossio and all the restaurants and shopping in between. Also, you can easily access Liberdade Avenue. In my opinion Chiado is the best place to stay in Lisbon. You can walk everywhere from here!"

Also, there are a lot of activities at week-end (markets, etc) and shops are open everyday of the week (only big shopping malls on Sunday)."

We rented an apartment in Chiado through an online service and it was a perfect location from which to base our stay. We were able to walk throughout the city given the central location of Chiado, From our rental we were a 10 minute walk from the Time Out Market, 10 minutes from Castelo S Jorge, 5 minutes or so from Barrio Alto and about 10 minutes from the river. In addition, there are many, many wonderful restaurants and bars and places to shop in Chiado. We hope to return and would most definitely view Chiado as the place to stay next time."

Attractions we enjoyed include the architecturally interesting Elevador de Santa Justa, the ruins of Igreja do Carmo, Museo Nacional de Arte Contemporanea do Chiado, Teatro de Sao Carlos. Interesting squares include Praca Luis de Camoes and the lovely but small Largo do Chiado where you can see delightful cal\u00e7ada portuguesa (mosaic cobblestone pavement). Largo do Carmo, which is just in front of the entrance to Igreja do Carmo and the Archeology Museum, is also a nice square in the Chiado district and good spot for a quite break from sightseeing in the area.

Otherwise, what's the point in visiting these places anymore?"

Besides that you can either go West down to the Parliament in Sao Bento or climb North and enjoy new perspectives of Lisbon.Of course I go there a lot and I know Lisbon so don't care with the dates I put here."

If you head west from Baixa, you'll enter this shopping district which is probably the most centrally located district in Lisbon.. From its perch on a hill, it's traversed by Rua Garrett (where our apartment was located), named for the noted romantic writer Jo\u00e3o Batista de Almeida Garrett (1799-1854). Many of the finest shops in the city, such as the Vista Alegre, a china and porcelain house, are here. One coffeehouse in particular, A Brasileira, has been a traditional gathering spot for the Portuguese literati. The food was nto great but the place is worth visiting. It is beautiful (see photos).at night is is one of the nciest neighborhoods to walk through. There is also a famous Santini Ice Cream shop right next tot he Chiado shopping Center. See the neighborhood photos. If you can rent an apartment or find a hotel in Chiado, I would stay there for sure."

It is an important place to go during the day and also at night.In what regards monuments, do not miss the ruins of Carmo Covent, the elevator of Rua Augusta (same construction style as the Tour Eiffel, in Paris), and the churches, particularly the ones on top of Rua Garret, and S. Carlos (theatre). You have an underground stop called Chiado. Thus, it is easy to go there."

It's a lively place during the day or by night.There's the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Pharmacy Museum and up the street Natural History Museum. You have two theaters, an Opera House. You can lounge at excellent coffee shops and esplanades, or have a gourmet experience in some of the best restaurants in town. Also have really nice vintage shops along with the trendy fashion shops. Christmas is a beautiful season with all the lights and street concerts. I recommend staying here at Chiado, either being a budget accommodation ( there are several brand new hostels) or in a boutique hotel. It's the perfect location in Lisbon!"

Love the Chiado area of old central Lisbon.Located in the mid to north end area of the wonderful, old world, central historic old Lisbon, the Chiado area offers a truly amazing mix of shopping, dining, cultural and historic elements and within a terrific exploration area of hilly street, hidden alley ways and secret gardens, parks and square - all of which make the area magical!!!The cross section of shops and shopping is wonderfully diverse - from very high end to common mid range chain stores (who's exterior and interior appearances look to aspire to their high end neighbours but maintain the consumer conscious pricing. There are the best of the best fashion and accessory retailers, decor and design shops, wonderful restaurants, cafe's, walk-in take out eateries, gelato cafes (a favourite), and many other that make the neighbourhood so fun to explore and experience.At one corner off the main shopping avenue, we discovered the alley of all the bookstores and book antiquariums - all of whom were having a massive sidewalk sale that afternoon. Around the next corner and down the street past some amazing cafes and a hidden open square we found the opera house and went in to do some quick gift shop shopping and see if we could get tickets for than nights performance - sold ot weeks ago unfortunately.The back to the main street, around a corner and up a steep alley past some wonderful art galleries, we found the absolutely amazing Carmo convent, a mediaeval convent that was ruined in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, but it's architectural remnants and wonderful small museum are a true hidden gem of the area.TIP: Visit the Carmo Convent in the late afternoon going into dusk. The lighting and sunset colours on the open arches and pillars are amazing, and then when dust hits the spotlighting / uplighting turns on - making the ancient stone architecture and the ambiance... over the top magical again!Then back to the main shopping street - and at one end (for those in your group that want more shopping) where the street dips down to it's lowest elevation, there is a very nice indoor shopping mall with a great collection of unique stores - again another hidden surprise.Luckily, for the 3 days that we stayed in the old historic core, our apartment was within a few short blocks walk of the Chiado area. Needless to say we returned more than a few times to explore, shop, sit / relax and people watch.Make the Chiado area a MUST if you get the chance to visit old central Lisbon. Well worth the time and effort to find this WONDERFUL Neighbourhood. Enjoy!"

Chiado is often described as a more upper class area and it certainly lives up to that reputation.It has a beautiful square, a metro that connects you to several places within Lisbon.The shops range from mid range to hih end designers. My favourite shop was 1shop which is a local shop but the clothes were of great quality and very cheap.There are plenty of places to eat and the pattiseries were amazing. You have to try the custard nata they are very yummy.The area is also close to Restores and Rossio both of which have great places to see and eat and all 3 are definitely worth a visit when in Lisbon.There is also the famous Santa Justa lift which is based around this area and gives great viewpoints for photos of the whole city.There is also a nice little shopping center which I unfortunately did not get an opportunity to visit but looked nice.The best way to travel is the metro but I have to admit the taxis are not that expensive at all."

At night the Chiado has a vibrant night life. About 1 block from the custard shop is a Fado bar that was featured in Anthony Bourdain's Lisbon episode. I went there and had an amazing great time!

Chiado is one of the principal shopping precincts of Lisbon and to me it seemed to be in two distinct sections: a multi-storey mall that links to the Baixa downtown area via escalators (or the Elevador de Santa Justa) and the Rua Garrett, which leads you to Barrio Alto. Both were popular with shoppers and strollers when we visited but for my mind - and with other tourists in mind - Rue Garrett is where it's at. The shopping mall is so anonymous it could be anyway. Rua Garrett on the other hand is full of character, pedestrian friendly, and lined with elegant, attractive buildings. Two stores that we especially liked were 'Bertrand' and 'Paris em Lisbon'. The former is said to be the oldest bookshop in the world, has lots of books in English, and browsing here was a much more pleasurable experience than doing so at Portugal's other famous bookshop, Livraria Lello & Irmao in Porto. The latter is a very classy fabric shop selling materials, linen etc of the highest quality.  There are no shortage of cafes and restaurants, though we were disappointed with our experience at the well-known Cafe Brasiliera."

Lots of high end shops in this district.When staying in Lisbon you should go to Cascais as well. Only a trip on the train separates you from Cais do Sodr\u00e9 in Lisbon and Cascais.

Weather was really warm in April so locals and tourists were out and about creating a good buzz. So many eateries, in particular pastry cafes. it was nice to visit some of the more traditional cafes, they can be a bit touristy but I am a tourist so when in Rome...a couple of things to note that may be useful. Chiado and much of inner Lisbon is sited on steep hills. I think this would be difficult for people with wheelchairs or large prams or people with any mobility issues. What makes this situation even more tricky is that all of the pavements are made of small square cobbles which are really slippy unless you are wearing rubber soles. After falling over twice, i bought a pair of converse type shoes which were ideal. Would highly recommend but think about your footwear."

Much of it was burnt down quite some years ago and rebuilt in the original style of architecture with some new modern buildings tucked away in the side streets. It is worth spending half a day walking around, visiting cafes or a restaurant, through the many squares that border it and connecting streets. There are expensive brand name shops in this district, which borders on theatre land, plus a modern art museum. We were there on a Sunday when an excellent street band entertained visitors. Approaching Baixa-Chiado on foot from Rossio or Placa da Figueira requires walking up steep narrow roads through rundown parts that might be considered characterful. There is much to see in this area generally. Recommend visiting on a weekend when not too hot."

There, you can also see a lot of historical buildings like churches. You can also find plenty of museums.Visit it! You won't regret.Bonus: when staying in Lisbon you can't not go to Cascais. Only a trip of train separates you from Cais do Sodr\u00e9 and Cascais. (Approximately 30 minutes). The village, right by the train stop is full of shops, cafes, little hidden beaches (such as Praia da Rainha-beach of the Queen in Portuguese), McDonald's, a mall, museums (Cidadela de Cascais, Condes de Castro Guimar\u00e3es...).

In this area are wondrous sites like the Eden theater which boasts full tropical palms under glass--overlooking the street--you can SEE these palms though the glass and they are full size!! There are also many museums and this area is where the red and blue line buses stop to let passengers on or off. (we got off of the hop on , hop off bus here) around the corner are gorgeous churches and squares we even saw a commercial being made in one square with a giant teddy bear. Be aware that there are gypsies in this area so guard your purses and belonging well as there are pick pockets--in fact it is best to have a money belt (IMO) and to keep it tucked in underneath your clothing--pickpockets like things that swing free or are in pockets-the closer you carry your valuables the less of a target you will be, avoid crowded areas where people can brush up against you and do not allow strangers to hug or tug on you or your clothing.That said, look around, there are mumerous museums and even city buildings are gorgeous and wonderfully carved. I did not shop at any of these stores as I had a destination--instead I people watched and admired all of the buildings--perhaps another time when both my pocketbook and my feet did not have other plans!!"

Wear comfortable footwear as there are lots of hills and cobble streets. There are queues for popular attractions but be patient. There are many outdoor restaurants, in the evening it is very pleasant to dine outside as there may be street entertainment. Try to fit in a night to hear Fado.Side streets are interesting as there may be little shops selling antiques, jewellery, unique items, nice to visit. Of course the architecture is beautiful."

We didn't want to shop although she would have helped us with that. We wanted to see a lot and have information about Lisbon, the people and the history. She was exceptional, pointed out tricks pickpockets use on the trams like asking you to open the window, showed us how to use the Metro and gave us local information that isn't in the guide books.

Small streets with the most amazing colors and tiled patterns on the buildings line the block and the larger avenues littered with restaurants, bars and all the shopping a woman could ask for pepper the beautiful streets. I went up to Ascensor da Bica - Bica Funicular - to ride one of the famous trolley (this one considered to be the most picturesque in the city, the others are Ascensor do Lavra - Lavra Funicular & Ascensor da Gloria - Gloria Funicular) and it was great. Although a short ride up/down the hill, for 3 euro it is something you need to do. In addition, a must if the Elevador de Santa Justa - the Santa Justa Lift. The only vertical lift in Lisbon, you have to get a view from the top, AMAZING! All in all, I had a great stay in Lisbon and I can't wait until I have the time to go back."

Just make sure you check reviews before going. Locals can be seen hanging in the neighborhood too. Overall, as far as what it has to offer, it is a great area to explore and it will probably leave you wanting to go back again and again.Tips: don't miss out on Gelado Santini (it's worth it even if there's a line, which is common during summer) and for dining try Sacramento, which also has a good lunch buffet."

Note it's not particulary interesting for young children, and for people, who aren't in to shopping, also there's no shopping opportunities if you like to buy something for your young ones (e.g. toy cars), in which case you'll have to go to El Corte Ingl\u00e9s.

The shopping around the streets is great and the coffee shops around Hotel Borges are very charming and reminiscent of the old days of Lisbon. There is usually music in the air in the streets during the day while the bars in the area can have fado at night. Tram 28 will get to this area as well as the metro has a stop that will pop you right into the middle of all the happenings."

Visit the oldest bookshop in Lisbon (Bertrand), Have wonderful cakes in some of the cafes (not A Brasileira, becuase it is overpriced) and sit down on Largo do Carmo with a book about the Portuguese flower revolution. This is where the Portuguese defeated the dicatorship and it happened just 35 years ago! Most of all, it happened in a non-violent way, that I believe the Portuguese can be very proud of.

And most of the areas mentioned in our guide as 'shopping-areas' are dull, and there are better zones for that in most other cities. Basically our view was, the magazines over-sell Lisbon.

Baixa-Chiado metro station has an entrance/exit in the heart of Chiado, very close to the historic \"A Brasileira\" cafe. Be vigiliant for pickpockets, but Lisbon is certainly no worse for crime than other major European cities. I entirely disagree with the review dated 25th April 2012; there is a lot to see and do in Chiado. Have a coffee at A Brasileira or one of the other cafes, visit the shops in Rua Garrett (such as \"Paris em Lisboa\") and soak up the atmosphere of this special part of the city, which has recovered so well from the disastrous fire of 1988."

Metro station adjacent to area, trams run through but try exploring the surrounding streets and the waterfront.The downside is there are a lot of not very good buskers and sunglass sellers although none were threatening. Beware pick pockets and thieves. Our friend had her wallet stolen"

We were in escalators on our way down the Metro in Baxia-Chiado station. Two guys came in between my busband and I and a girl came in front of me blocking my view. My husband noticed that my bag was opened and he pointed at one of the guy and I demanded him to get my wallet back but this guy pointed at the other guy who was on his way back up to outside again. We chased after him but he ran away too fast. In hindsight, we realised that they were all involved and highly organised and professional. Up until this point, we loved Lisbon and wanted to come back but I would never go back there again. A guy who works at the Lisbon airport said 'Welcome to Lisbon' when we mentioned about what happened. Is Lisbon that bad? I've been to many other countries famous for their crimes like Colombia but never been mugged."
