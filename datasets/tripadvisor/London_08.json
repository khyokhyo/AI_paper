It's simply one of the best parks in the city, and allows tourists a break from the lines and the crowds and the noise, without spending a cent if they so choose.I intend on returning, again and again, but even before this trip of mine ends."

Last year, I visited the Park several times - including when I attended Frieze London. Frieze is an *event*. It\u2019s not your typical visit to a museum or art gallery. When you arrive, you are surrounded by beautiful people and wannabe beautiful people. I felt a bit out of place as I observed all of the beautiful people interactions around me. I preferred the beauty on the walls to that in the corridors. Personally, I liked strolling through Regents Park instead of being in the Frieze tent. The outdoor Frieze exhibits were incredible and worked well in the peaceful, manicured grounds of Regents Park. Accordingly, my rating is for Regents Park as a whole and not for Frieze London."

            "review": "Great boating experience. I have visited Regent's Park on many occasions over the years and it is possibly my no. 1 park in London, but today, for the first time, my 10-year old son and I hired a pedalo for an hour and went round the lake. It was a very pleasant way of experiencing the park and the wildlife. The weather was beautiful and we got there around noon, before it got too crowded. Unfortunately we had just missed the early bird offer which applies before noon, but at least we didn't have to queue.I'd certainly recommend the experience and opting for one hour instead of half an hour, gives you enough time to leisurely go round the small island a couple of times. There is a small kids only pedalo in a pond next to the boat hire as well as a good playground with sand and climbing frames. To find the larger playground you need to walk across St Mary's Gardens and out the other side and then head south. It lies in the South-East corner of Regents Park and has sand, climbing frames, slides, swings and water feature. The park got uncomfortably crowded in the afternoon and we chose to leave. Next time we pay Regent's Park a visit we'll try to get there earlier in the day and catch the early bird rate and maybe we'll even be brave enough to try the rowboat."

You really feel London life here and are reminded of what a great place it is to live. It does get busy but there it feels very cultural, walking past the markets, we stopped off at a little cafe right by St Mark's Church which was very peaceful and pretty. The dogs loved the walk and when we reached Regent's Park they were even happier. I'd only ever been to Regent's Park once before so had forgotten just how big it is. There is lots of open space for dogs to run around it. There was a cricket match on and lots of people playing football - a lovely sunny day and a good chance of experience North London. Only downside is it is obviously very touristy and we went on a Saturday so it was heaving with people along the canal spilling out from Camden."

When you walk round Regent's Park you forget everything, your mind becomes clear and you are so memorised by the views that you wouldn't realise you were walking round a park in the UK. This is a cut through to London Zoo which is much nicer way then taking the bus, it is about a 20 minute walk to the zoo from the south entrance so it isn't in fact too far. The park is so well maintained and you can tell that people really take pride in their work there. There are benches all around so if you want to just sit down and take it all in you can, there are also cafes and restaurant on the way so if you get peckish you can stop off for a bit to eat and there are loos which is also important, although you do have to have to pay 20p. All together this is a very magical park and you really need to walk round it when in London as it is breathtakingly beautiful."

If you have a spare 4-6 hours then you can start at Canary Wharf and walk all the way to Little Venice and what a walk it is!!The earlier that you start the better because the walk is flooded with cyclists and runners. But there is room for all.From Canary Wharf to Kings Cross it's a fascinating look at the old and the re-developed sitting side-by-side. But if you don't want to walk the whole thing then you must pick the canal up at Kings Cross and head north. Some sensational new developments to marvel at and dream about living in. Then you hit Camden Lock. Not my favourite but an incredible array of stalls and eating places. Continuing on, you walk through beautiful houses up to Regents Park and then you reach London Zoo (you can't miss the Aviary). At this point you can continue on to Little Venice but I would suggest that you dive off right onto Primrose Hill for the best free view of London landmarks. From there it's a short walk to Hampstead Heath and another sensational London attraction.You've got to do it. You will learn more about London in a day than you will get from any book or organised trip.And it's free!!!"

The paths provide an overview of the park: water features, boating options, children's activities, and people watching. We ran 2 trails and the only downside is that you have to follow the maps in the park - there's no app for your phone.

            "review": "Beautiful Park - Runners Paradise !. I stayed in Regents park area recently for a work trip to London. Being a keen runner I set about on the Monday evening to check my surroundings for running routes. I took a stroll through regents park on a late evening after work as it was getting dusky. It was one of the hottest days of the year and even though it was late there were still lots of people about on the grass enjoying a champagne picnic, runners taking advantage of the slighter cooler temperature or people taking a stroll. It's such a pretty park. Very flat. Big wide paths so no problem for pedestrians, runners & cyclists. Very very clean. No litter anywhere. A very quaint little coffee shop & there are a few snack stops and cafes dotted along the way. It's very close to London Zoo. Beautiful gardens there. It's a huge park and I didn't get the opportunity to go around all of it but so much there and gorgeous green open space. In my 1 overnight stay in London I visited regents park 3 times! So that speaks volumes in how much I loved it. I went back the very following morning to run through it & up to Primrose Hill. (Just the other side of regents park) I highly recommend you take the stroll (or run/bike) up there it's only about a mile and you get stunning views across the whole of London. I was in awe at sunrise and it definitely made the run to the top very worth while. I then returned again to steal 30 mins in the sunshine on my lunch break the same day as it was just a 5 minute walk from Triton Street & found I was joining 100s of other commuters and city workers with the same thought - but it was lovely. Still very easy to find a spot on the grass to enjoy my lunch, the park & the sunshine. It's an affluent area of London. Big houses, posh cars - nice to drift off into a dream world for a few minutes whilst there.I must say I felt very safe. As a female on my own I was cautious of course as you should be where ever you are, but there was always lots of people about, plenty of runners & bikes.If you are in fitzrovia district or near regents park - give it a go. You won't be disappointed. "

If you are looking for a little space in London I suggest you head out to the beautiful large Royal Park of Regent's Park, one of my favourites. The park is also the home of the London Zoo, there are many large sporting fields, tree lined avenues to explore and discover, but do not miss the Inner Circle where you will find the Queen Mary's Garden, the largest rose garden in all of London. The north-west side of the park borders onto the Regent's Canal Towpath a great place to take a stroll and not to be missed if you love walking as we do."

I used to drive through the perimeter of the park as a short cut and had no idea that the park itself was such a nice place to explore until I was invited to the sunset safari. It starts at 6.00pm on a Friday at the Zoo and there are many performers, food stalls, merry-go-round and ofcourse, the animals. The nicest thing about the whole experience is seeing all the different cultures having a great time. I like watching all the different faces from far flung places, converge in London and have a great time. It is truly amazing."

The nearest underground station to get to the park is Regents Park on the Bakerloo line.I went with my family and spent almost an entire day in this beautiful park. We went for a picnic. We also went for a walk to Primrose Hill from where we got some nice views of London. It opens every day of the year at 5am. Closing times vary according to the months. In summer, it closes as late as 9.30pm. The Jubilee Gates mark the entry to Queen Mary's Gardens, on the Inner Circle in Regent\u2019s Park and were donated by an artist Goetze who lived near Regents Park. The Jubilee Gates are made of iron and look awesome in black and gold. They were installed to mark the Silver Jubilee of King George V and the official opening of Queen Mary's Gardens.Regents Park has some nice fountains and statues.There is a large drinking fountain called the Ready Money Drinking Fountain. It is made of granite and marble and is located in the centre of Broad Walk. Ready Money was the nickname of a Parsee industrialist, Sir Cowasjee Jehangir, who donated this fountain as a thank you to the British for the protection they gave to him and his fellow Parsees during the days of the British Raj in India. There is the Triton Fountain which has bronze sculptures of two mermaids and a sea God. It is located opposite the Jubilee Gates at the end of the central walk which runs through the middle of Queen Mary's Gardens. It was given by the wife of the artist Goetze.There is a Lion Vase which is a stone bowl that is held up by four stone lions that have wings on them - hence the proper name \u201cGriffin Tazza\u201d. It is located in the centre of Avenue Gardens.There is another statue of note \u2013 The Boy and Frog Statue. This is located in the beautiful Queen Mary Garden. It is made of bronze and shows a boy and a frog sitting on a granite pedestal.In St. John\u2019s Lodge Garden in the north east of the Inner Circle is the statue of Hylas and the nymph. It is a bronze statue mounted on a stone pedestal. From what I can remember of my Greek history lessons, Hylas was one of the Argonauts, who went with Jason in the quest for the Golden Fleece. Unfortunately, Hylas was kidnapped by the nymph of Spring - never to be seen again.If have time, you should visit the bandstand in The Regent's Park is located between the boating lake and the Inner Circle. The IRA bombed it in the early eighties. Seven soldiers died and many were injured when they were performing a concert.We also saw \u201cThe Hub\u201d which is an outdoor sports area. There were people playing football and cricket. If I were living in London near Regent Park, I would be visiting this park every day. "

I don't have a garden with my flat so I decided I was going to take my book to a London park and relax in the sun. I got there and it was pretty busy already. The park is huge so I wandered deeper into the park. There's some really pretty gardens and benches to sit on. I sat against a tree near the open theatre. It was a great atmosphere and people were having picnics with prosecco and takeaway pizza express pizzas. All the dogs were on leads too.I could have put 4 stars as there aren't any peaceful areas (when it's good weather) as it gets heaving with tourists. I'd recommend for a picnic, pug watching & reading a book."

I was lucky enough to work near Regent's Park and saw its beauty through all of the seasons - my favourite was Spring when the blossom was in full bloom and summer when the flowers and foliage are glorious. It's great for strolling around, picnics and ice cream. The gardens, boating lake and the open air theatre are some of the highlights. It is, overall, a lovely oasis of greenness in central London."

Its a large green park with plenty of space but an annoying amount of school kids playing games which I imagine are part of the school day. It was a Monday at around 11 am and there where kids everywhere. Another disappointment was the dog mess. We saw one dog owner totally ignore the fact their dog had fouled in the park,they just walked away but there were no dog wardens anywhere in the park which is strange for a big park with lots of kids and lots of dogs,council cutbacks I guess. It is the dog owners responsibility but some just dont care and spoil it for others. If you go then watch out for it."

Absolutely beautiful Park in the center of London, great for all the family, perfect for leisurely/romantic strolls, or picnics or even a game of Frisbee! The flower gardens are beautiful, especially the rose garden, but my absolute favourite are the cherry blossom along Chester Road, check them out around April time! There are also a few cafes for a rest and a spot of tea when you want a break."

The mansions that curve around the park a reminder for those lucky people who live there how lucky they are to have such a park on there footstep. We strolled around the park going past the boathouse, the caf\u00e9 was open , however the boat rides that I was hoping to surprise the kids with were not happening until winter season was over , these will begin from March onwards. To go the park cost nothing, take a hamper choose a nice day and relax, cant wait till the weather warms up to do this."

On our visit we saw Egyptian,Canada,Greylag and Red Breasted Geese.Also Mandarin,Mallard,Coots,Moorhen,Smew,Pochard,Tufted Duck and also Black swans aswell as Mute and Whooper. A wildlife paradise for us...the pond also has more rare varietys of duck which must be part of a collection within the park as they are not species generally found in the UK.

You can walk, sit, run and play here, something for everyone and apart from the occasional plane and very muted traffic noise(completely absent in most areas) this is a very tranquil place to spend some quality time away from the city. Foot paths crisscross the park so you can cover as much of the park as you wish with plenty of seating for a break when required. An oasis in the middle of London it's great."

Consequently, it was necessary for us to take a long but very enjoyable stroll through Regent\u2019s Park to access the underground station.The park varies from areas of large open grassland environments, through tree lined avenues to formal garden beds with fountains, surrounded by masses of flowers.The formal gardens were a favourite of ours. They were full of colour and beautifully manicured.We walked through them as we headed south along the Broad Walk towards the Outer Circle.Regent\u2019s Park is recommended a great park to visit and thereby escape the hustle and bustle of inner London.

            "review": "Always in bloom. London has many, wonderful green spaces--Hyde Park, Green Park, even the small squares like Lincoln's Inn Fields. However, London has relatively few places you can go to enjoy the flowers. Regent's Park meets that need. Queen Mary's Garden in the middle always has lovely displays, the English Garden walk is impressive, and the flowers around the perimeter set this park apart. After a busy day, whether sightseeing, shopping, entertaining children, or working, it is so relaxing to immerse oneself in nature, especially the colorful nature of flowers. The gardeners of Regent's Park keep it in prime condition, and there is always something of interest, even in the dreary days of winter. But of course spring through autumn are its peak times."

Long time since I had been to Regent's Park but my wife came here in the summer, so we popped back there on a visit to Harley Street nearby. Despite being autumn, the gardeners were lifting old plants that were over and planting up new things to give autumn interest. Nice to see that care and money is being spent to maintain the feel and tranquillity of the park. Well worth a visit if you are in the west end at any time. Take a few hours to wander round, take in the beds, water features, paths, etc and relax."

It houses everything from local faves (boating lake, extensive playing fields) as well as world-reknowned places (Queen Mary's Rose Garden, London Zoo, the open air theatre). And it also regularly hosts large events. There's plenty of different 'zones' to explore: v formal English gardens, many fountains, easy walking paths. And the planting is always lovely. My only complaint? The food venues aren't v good. And there's not much else close by, that doesn't take a good amount of walking to get to. So take your own, or eat before you arrive. Things to note: This is a Royal Park, which means that there are different rules and regulations which are not only different to un-Royal parks, but are also enforced. Have a look on the Royal Parks website before you go. And if you don't have time for that, then take heed of the signs... And most of all, enjoy! :)"

There is a lake with boats, lots of birds, a beautiful rose garden and very interesting architecture. It's also home to London zoo and a vast variety of trees."

My partner was dubious as the entrance was somewhat unassuming, with unkempt grass and nothing much else. However, on rounding a corner we came to the Queen Mary Rose Garden. This was spectacular and all the roses were in bloom, impressive itself at this time of year.We spent quite a bit of time in the formal and ornamental gardens as they were beautiful. Not that peaceful as everyone else in London seemed to have the same idea, including several wedding parties! But lovely nonetheless.We then just wandered around past the (huge) boating lake and children's play area, enjoying the surroundings and the sunshine.We then walked to Primrose Hill but that's for another review!"

The interior gardens are ornate and seem to be aimed for the royal family originally. The English gardens to the south side are worth walking due to the size of the gardens and the good set up of the beds and statues.

It was literally in the middle of the park, and it was so symbolic and I have read the book, and I think the acting was superb, it's like walking into a jungle!!!Pigeons and butterflies flew around you! It was perfect, I had a burger as well, as you can get vouchers. It was really like you were in the middle of the island, because the set was so amazing!!!It has definitely been one of the best productions I have seen, I would really go again!! It is quite hard to find. If you go through the golden gates, and then turn left and go straight on, you should find the reception area. I think the production would not really be suitable for 7-9 year olds because of the savages and killing people, but 10 upwards it should be ok, and they should understand the storyline and the symbolism. I'm eleven, and am nearly twelve, I've read the book and know the storyline. It was a brilliant production, it's a great experience!!!!"

There's a lovely roses garden inside the park, a lake, sports fields, lovely paths to discover and several places to eat and drink. The London zoo is also locaten in the park (but you have to pay entry to go there).The area in which Regent's Park is located is lovely, quieter than the center of London and with lots of lovely buildings around.

Excellent seating in the theatre and plenty of room to take a picnic outside the theatre also. Only 10 minutes walk from Marylebone Road. We had a fantastic night here and despite the rain (they stopped the show and we stood in the covered bar for 5 minutes before the show restarted) this is a real gem so close to the centre of London.P.S.

I didn't realise how big the park was until we looked at the map & it even has a boating lake but we didn't get that far.The gardens are so beautiful & immaculate with lots of bright stunning flowers with water fountains.It was a lovely hot day & while you sit & relax you forget you are in the middle of London.Its a very peaceful space & as you walk more into the parkland you see lots of joggers & dog walkers.We saw families enjoying picnics & people playing footie & cricket.The locals are very lucky to have this place to relax in & enjoy.I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting London & considering it's free you can't go wrong.I would say though it's a place to go in the summer & not the winter.Also you can visit another garden called the queens Mary but we didn't go in & you have to pay to go in.Also you can get to the zoo through Regent's Park if you follow the signs.We really enjoyed the park & as the sun was shining we could sit on a bench & relax.A good place to visit if you are a people watcher."

You can get there by getting the tube to Regents Park station, or if you are in the area sightseeing at Madam Tussauds or the Sherlock Holmes Museum, you can walk there from Baker Street. It has a number of beautiful Rose Gardens and the park is also home to the London Zoo. It is large, covering around 395 acres, so there is plenty of space to relax and unwind away from the London traffic."

As soon as you walk through the gates from Bakers Street station the noise and craziness of London just melts away. There were copious benches all along the lake with views of the bird life. It's a place to watch the world go by, although you can be more active hiring pedalos! (\u00a328 for a family) We took a stroll up to the playground which was excellent for maybe under 13's although my 16 year olds had fun! The toilets were immaculate that were nearby, unfortunately not having 20p to pay to get in them we didn't get to actually sit on them at all! So bring your change unlike me. We only explored a tiny part of this huge park, you could definitely spend a day when the weather is kinder, even just to clear your head from the city sounds."

Always wanted to visit Regent's Park ever aince watching 101 Dalmatians as a kid.Spent a lazy afternoon at Regent's Park with my other half and had absolutely no regrets!Enjoyed the beautiful scenery and even played with the pigeons and squirrels.Skipped the London Zoo since my home country's zoo probably already one of the best."

            "review": "Wide Open Spaces,Gardens & Lakes.. Regent's Park is probably less frequented than the other ' big two' ( Hyde Park & St. James's Park ) Very easy to access from numerous tube & main line stations & buses & also quite easy to park a car- if you can face getting in & out of London! For a day out why not walk/take a canal boat trip from Little Venice along the Regent's Canal to the Park? As most people realise, London Zoo sits in one corner of the Park but it's probably too much of a stretch to visit that & still have time to do justice to the Park. The bulk of the park is contained by the Outer Circle Rd. with the smaller area contained within the Inner Circle Rd. The Inner Circle contains the lovely Queen Mary Rose Garden plus a water garden surrounded by shrubs & Herbaceous beds. I don't think the Rose Garden etc is kept to such a high standard as it was in my younger days but I really do think it is still well worth visiting. There is a very large lake within the Outer Circle with a great range of birdlife to admire & feed including on my recent visit, no less than 9 Grey Herons in one spot snapping up carrot strips kindly provided by a visitor. Pedalos can be hired here & also on a smaller circular lake nearby, these for smaller children. Also many flower beds & I must say they are very imaginatively planted with great combinations of colour & shape. Wide open grass areas, statuary, sports pitches & a good few eateries & snack bars. Altogether a great place to pass a whole day, especially with children & you don't have to spend a fortune."

It is the first time I encountered two camels looking at me during a run (there is a zoo in the park). I loved the gardens, the water features, and be warned that it is a big park, you may wish to rent a pedalo if visiting with family. Highly recommended."

We enjoyed watching a swan family swim around the lake, accompanied by several ducks, geese and other types of waterfowl. After many days of chasing around London, and taking a few day trips beyond, the afternoon at Regent's Park was relaxing and time well spent, and a good way to get away from the crowds. There are several places to grab a snack, and you can also rent small paddle-boats to pedal around the pond if you feel so inclined. We did not tour the zoo at Regent's Park, so cannot comment on that particular attraction."

Breakfast menus on table, decided went to queue to order while in queue menus were changed for lunchtime and we advised couldn't order from breakfast menu. Fine, can live with that, chose something from new menu, when at counter told that until 12 only pizza and soup available. Either put times on menu or make things available when menu out.

This park is literally amazing, depending on what entrance you arrive you wont be disappointed in what this park has to offer.The park has a variety of facilities and amenities including gardens, a lake, waterfowl and a boasting area, sports pitches and of course not forgetting the little ones- the children's playground! They also have a open air theatre too!The northern side of the park is home to LONDON ZOO!!, they also have amazing flower gardens which is just lush in the blossom season. Primrose hill is also located in this side of the park and the views from this is just stunning!The western section of the park is home to the infamous London Central Mosque better known as regents park mosque. A highly visible landmark!Overall- this park is just what every park should be like!. when the weather is lovely and hot, this park sure does get busy but if you find a very cool spot - you wont be disappointed in spending the whole day there!"

Walking around in the city and finding a park is like finding an oasis in the desert (although I admit, I have not experienced the desert thing yet but I have a vivid imagination). I like Regents Park because it is big. You can walk around for quite a while and just let the city stress drain away. There are some tennis courts that you can rent at reasonable prices. You can either just show up and play (wait if there are too many people) but the easiest thing is to book online. Cost is between \u00a38-12 per hour. If tennis doesn't float your boat, but boats do, then you can also rent boats for some easy paddling on the pond or head over to the Zoo or the next-door Primrose Hill for more leisurely activities. I like Regents Park."

Was originally not planning on visiting it, however after an expedition to Abbey Road, we decided to walk around a bit while heading back to our hotel. This took us right through regent park from the late afternoon-sunset. We spent some time taking in the view of the canal, with a couple of unique canal boats passing us. Then darted through the middle of the park where amature soccer was being played all around us.However the real magical part came when the sun had set and we came to the Inner Circle road. It was all lit up and very beautiful. We walked past a wedding, most certainly taking their wedding photos of this stock photo like setting. Once we exited the park we found a random Italian restaurant a few blocks away and had a truly wonderful meal.Overall i couldn't believe how quite and peaceful this park was the whole time we were there. I wish we had gone earlier to explore more and maybe see the zoo."

The twists are the Monkey, Butterfly and Bird houses where you walk through areas where the animals are within touching distance, but touching is \"verboten\" and quite rightly so. You can spend a day there. We took the tube to Camden Town and took a taxi to the zoo entrance. The Zoo only takes up a part of Regent's Park so watch how you try to get there. On entrance, follow the path and start with the penguins. These come from south America and appreciate heat. The Bugs house is worth a visit as you can see the insects etc at close range, even using a digital microscope. The Meercats are there so you can compare the \"meercat\"! It;s a great day out. may I suggest taking a picnic as some of the prices inside can be a tad high. If you get a sunny day, sunscreen etc will be needed as well. You might think admission expensive, but it is a \"Grand Day Out\"!"

The seats at the theatre afford excellent views for everyone and with the sun blazing down it was a perfect afternoon. The set was perfect, the orchestra just hidden behind the stage. The sound equipment was first class and we settled down to await the start of the production. I should add that there were plenty of places to purchase drinks etc prior and during the interval which lasted for 45 minutes which left enough time in hand to regain your seat. The singing, dancing and acting was truly brilliant. The songs so well known and loved. The costumes so colourful it was a joy to be part of the audience and a standing ovation at the end of the performance was very well deserved. A perfect Saturday afternoon, we all left humming our favourite song"

Those who wish to be a little more active will walk, run, jog, or wheeze their ways along the miles of pathways. Some people seem to organise games of cricket, football, baseball, frisbee, and such like. There is clearly enough space on the grassed areas for them all. Then there are those who clearly enjoy doing nothing more than sitting on one of the many benches and watching the world passing by. The Park seems able to accommodate all the hundreds and thousands of people who come here each day, and they all seem to have the space they need. All in all, it makes for a very happy international atmosphere, and the world always seems a better place when we are in Regents Park."

For several years, I lived near Regents Park and I became well acquainted with its amazing assets. The park is huge, with an outer and inner circle that make the interior park sections more accessible if you have a car (tons of parking). The well-laid out walking paths, the boating pond, Regent's canal, the rose garden, the outdoor theatre, the running track and sports fields appeal to a wide variety of visitors (not to mention the London Zoo at the North end). But London residents relish the park's elegant serenity and ever-changing activity level. Wildlife is abundant: ducks and water fowl thrive in protected waterways, green parrots crisscross the trees in summer, and herons live in a reserve at the Southeast corner (over the foot bridge). The only disruptive elements are the swift-moving bike riders who race around the outer circle. On any day, you'll see varieties of dogs and dog owners, as well as visitors of every description quietly taking in the beauty of this lovely London refuge."

It is one of the 'must-see' attractions in London if you are coming from abroad or even from the UK, you won't be disappointed. The present season included a re-run of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' which was simply wonderful when we saw it last year. Parking is fairly easy if you arrive early and park on the road. Food is good before the show and the facilities are always being improved. Sight lines are perfect and one year a fox even wandered onto the side of the stage!!! If it rains, who cares?

There is so much dignity about certain parts of our capital and this is definitely in the top 5.Any time of the year you will find interest here, from the snow covered trees to the blooming summer petals...this park holds its own, it can be proud, quirky, majestic, cosy, interactive, solitary...it has it all with the tree and birds and retreat from the traffic nd bustle of nearby major streets nd paces of interest o tourist swell a practical offices nd eturants nd shopping areas.A real retreat, always always a pleasure to be within this park."

I have been to most of the other parks here which are all lovely in different ways but Regents Park is by far the best Park. I thought unspoilt and close to natural Richmond Park would be hard to beat having spent my birthday there in May but this Park did it. I highly recommend it - especially Queen Mary's Gardens."

Follow the path until you are opposite the waterfall. The best photos are taken from there. Explore that area as you can also go to the top of the waterfall. Beautiful weeping willow trees, lovely roses. This area changes with the seasons. The outdoor theatre is here, along with a very reasonable cafe that sells picnics. Walk through the hidden pathways to the big fountain. In the outer area, you can go to the lake and rent boats.This area is great for jogging, running. There are so many varieties of birds here, including ducks, geese, more-hens and swans. Near to the Regents Park Mosque is a children's playground with toilets. you can walk to London Zoo from here.To get there, take a tube train to Baker Street and walk to the park 5-8 mins. There is a shop by the station selling sandwiches and drinks and an ice-cream shop. The Sherlock Holmes museum and Madame Tussauds and planetarium are all nearby."

The lake with ducks, swans and other birds is picturesque and there are plenty of open spaces to enjoy. That's the good news.The bad news is that in places it is like a maze. There are several directional maps but these are nowhere near as clear or helpful as the normal maps that are visible in many of the streets of the West End.My wife and I walked from Primrose Hill through the Park to Baker Street. The first thing to note is that the Inner Ring Road and Outer Ring Road are actually 'outside' the Park. The exit from the park to the road does not coincide directly with the entrance to the Park. This means it is easy to end up going round in circles. There were no signposts back towards Primrose Hill. Indeed we met a lovely couple walking and he was getting so frustrated that he was beginning audibly to speak loudly in very strong language. I think they were native English speakers; for anyone who is not a native English speaker or who does not know the layout of the Park, it can be very difficult to find one's way around.Better and more accurate signposts please !"

London has a number of famous parks, but most of them are not famous for their merits as parks, rather because they belong to the royalty, or something important happened there, etc.Regent's Park, however, deserves a visit as just a park. It's fairly large and not crowded, good for jogging or relaxing, and the central part (Queen Mary's Gardens) is really beautiful and IMO mandatory on a first London trip. It doesn't hurt that it's between two major attractions\u2014the Sherlock Holmes Museum and the London Zoo."

This is an amazing resource in the heart of London.It would be so much better if the Royal Pavings Commission (who run the roads) restricted the motor traffic. Why a park has to have through traffic is a mystery. Local surveys show the vast majority of this traffic is not visiting the park, it is taking a short-cut through it. Speeds of over 80 mph have been recorded on the Outer Circle.Unfortunately traffic noise is dominant from almost every part of the park. Such a shame.Highlights are the flower gardens in the Inner Circle and the beautiful broadwalk down the middle."

Be thankful that we live in the 21st century and that we have the freedom to go and travel to places that our ancestors did not have the chance to see in their lives.The English are known for their love of gardening, and the this love is very apparent in the landscapes that are found in many areas of the park. Be sure to walk and take pictures. During my visit, the tulips were in bloom and the roses were just about to open their buds.Regent's Park is also a great location for people watching. It is here where you can truly find Londoners enjoying their time away from the hustle of the city. I visited during a weekday and it was fun to watch as different local schools came to the park to play different athletic events. It was amusing to watch PE classes where the students were playing cricket, lawn bowling, and croquet among other games. As an American, I was also surprised to see a group with ball gloves playing catch with a softball.As is the case in many public areas in Europe, the toilets cost money, so be prepared if you plan to spend a good amount of time in the park.If it is a nice day, Regent's Park is an excellent location to eat a picnic lunch. There were a couple of food stands, but some of them appeared seasonal. If you plan to eat in the park, check to see what is available and open before you go."

Best of all, a comfortable jog around the Outer Circle, which circumscribes the whole park, takes about 20-25 minutes. I did it every other day for years, till I retired. Or if you prefer to jog on grass, you can choose almost any distance you like, inside the park. Downsides: not enough seating, watch out for the duck-crap near the lake-water's edge, plus rather too many antisocial (sometimes aggressive) cyclists, weaving though the walkers."

Regent's has it all, traditional flower gardens, large rose beds, two water features with pedal or rowboats available on the large lake, hidden Japanese garden, lawns, restaurants. Lovely to walk around, very relaxing, good for families, the most peaceful of any other park we,ve found in London."

I remember how large London Zoo seemed, when I last visited many years ago; it occupies just a small corner of the park.If you love roses and time it right you are in for a treat; there are said to be over 12,000 plants (we must go back in June/July to see them in flower). Away from the roads that circle the park, all you will hear is the birdlife. Car parking \"on site\" is chargeable seven days a week. On a Sunday, we easily found free car parking only a 15 minute walk away (near the University College Hospital). There are a nuimber of London Underground stations next to the park.Overlooking the park are the elegant terraces of large houses/mansions.

I always have been a nature lover, and when I moved to London, Regent's Park has been my first green spot where to hide from the city's chaos.At that time, I used to live at Camden Town, which I hated, and every morning I was running at the Park. Surrounded by ducks, swans, different smells, beautiful gardens, and colors. I loved watch the dawn at Regent's Park it was poetry. Maybe I might be too syrupy, but so far, it is the most romantic and idyllic Park I ever visited. When you walk in, you feel as if you are miles away from the London's madness. If you are having a bad day, run there, after, everything will have a better perspective.It is ideal to practice sports, watch someone doing sports, relax, meditate, have a picnic or just have a nice walk.Everyone should visit Regent's Park once in a lifetime."

Regent's Park is a real gem, a quiet oasis for the bustle of Central London, close to many tourist destinations such as Madame Tussauds, Sherlock Holmes Museum, Marylebone High Street, the Mosque and the Zoo, it is a quiet and safe place to stop, relax and unwind. Many traffic free walks of various lengths, especially round the boating lake, good cafe near the Tennis Centre and places to eat your own picnic, either on one of the many benches or one the well tended grass. Copious amounts of (nearly) wild life including water birds of many kinds, pigeons and doves, hundreds of squirrels, to watch whilst you rest.Best park in London."

I have studied near Regent's Park for years, and it is a wonderful place to take a short trip when you are in London. It was almost everything that you'd want in a park. It has the wonderful Inner and Outer Circle configuration, with inter-crossing paths all over the park, and it's wonderful lfor all - walking, running, cycling, sun-tanning or picnicking. Many just sit and read, sleep, snack, kick a football or walk the dog. There's the ducks and swans to feed, the youthful enjoyment of London Zoo, or the culture of the outside Theatre. Then there are the magnificent scented rose blooms in summer in Inner Circle. What better free rest and relaxation is there for all, including friends and the family?"

The layout is very clever, and spots which require extra attention to the childrens' welfare are relatively well guarded, and guardians have time for the 'save the lemmings' life'-run!It was set aside initially by Henry Viii and recognised for its' potential contribution to regal leisure-filled moments by succeeding monarchs. The lawns are always well-tended, with seasonal, and sometimes out of season species of bulbs, shrubs, and resident trees, which have witnessed its' continued contributions to Central London life over time and many a colourful picnic/or gatherings of like-minded compatriots, and fun-filled moments. London zoo is also located here, with its' world renowned inhabitants, as well as the summer open air theatre. A magnificent and continuing staple of London living.

Very pleasant walk around the boating lake with lots of birds to see, including a number of peacefully dozing herons, who weren't in the least bit phased by all the humans around.

We travel to London in late April mainly for the beautiful flower display which we think are better than the Chelsea flower show in late May. The London Zoo is here; nice but small. In summer, Queen Mary's Rose Garden is a must see."

The ducks, squirrels, and other animals running about were so interesting. There is also interesting tours that start here and allow you to see the city. Even though it is the center of the city near Buckingham Palace it is very peaceful and relaxing."

Regent's Park is one of London's many great parks and it is certainly very scenic and pleasant to visit and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.The Inner Circle and the lake are amongst the picturesque highlights, and of course there is London Zoo here as well, though we think the many playing fields and the Hub detract somewhat from the simple beauty of the park.Definitely a good place to visit whatever the season."

I, after three years of staying locally, have yet to get to the zoo but I have walked by it a dozen times. Lots of roads, paths, diversions to keep a girl happy and walking. Local neighborhoods are filled with interesting shops and more diversions. I love the window boxes on display around the park. This to me, is my Central Park in London. Next time, I think I will ride a bike."

This is definitely one of London's loveliest parks and a breath of fresh air after all the city trekking and tube riding. I heard from a local that the zoo is not worth the price of admission as most of the larger animals have been relocated. I entered by the mosque after exiting the tube at St. John's Wood and walking down Wellington Road."

This one I feel is often very underrated by comparison with some of the other ones in Central London.This is probably due to the fact that it's slightly more out of the way being that it seems to link the central part of London with the north west part of London.Although it is situated next to some of the most interesting parts of the city centre. With the world famous Madam Tussauds & Sherlock Holmes Museum just nearby. As well as the delightful London Zoo (which is also worth a visit) just at the top corner.Of course it doesn't seem to be quite as big as Hyde Park, but never the less you'll certainly enjoy spending some of your vacation time enjoy the lush and colourful gardens here. With people playing sports in the summer months, the various species of wildlife running around and the pretty colourful but crisper scenes of the autumn leaves falling. Giving rise to some very spectacular views. With most of the time feeling certainly less crowded that the other parks.Quite frankly just like Hyde Park. It's pretty much a much a Central London Park for just about all seasons. So make sure you pay this one a visit and I certainly don't think you'll be dissapointed."

I have often come here with friends to go to the open air theatre, but this time I decided to explore it a little more. The south of the park (which you go through on the way to the theatre) has a boating lake and is good for a walk or a picnic in warmer weather. Further to the east in the south of the park the English and Avenue Gardens make a very pleasant walk. But as of today my favourite part is in the south east corner of Queen Mary's Gardens within the Inner Circle. Here you will find a small lake and garden with water features, where the noise of London is drowned out by the sound of water. The North of the park is more open, like a common, and contains sports pitches and long paths which are good for walking dogs. I enjoyed it, but if you are visiting London you may want to spend your time elsewhere, though it does make a pleasant walk if you are on your way to London Zoo or Primrose Hill."

            "review": "One of the best free outdoor attractions in London. This is not the best known or most accessible of London Parks but I have been coming here for 40 years and always love coming even in the cooler weather. The best time of year is Spring into early Summer although there is also plenty to see even now.Firstly allow at least an hour to walk around although you can easily spend half a day here without going to the Zoo or open air theatre or playing tennis or hiring a row boat...Secondly print a PDF map off if you want to make the most of your time here.Thirdly best to come on a nice or at least dry day - if it is raining you can get very wet here as it is a very exposed site.If you want a nice walk here start at the entrance North of Baker Street Station. Walk around the boating lake - there are some beautiful flower borders near the wooden bridge at the Southern end. In the Summer on a Sunday there may be a band playing on the Victorian Bandstand. From the West side of the lake you can view 'The Holme' which must be one of the most magnificent locations for any private dwelling in Central London.Do not miss the smaller lake and rose gardens to the South as well as the Avenue Gardens near the South East corner of the park (they have only been planted some 20 years but look much more established). During the Summer the most spectacular gaden is the small round garden right at the centre of Queen Mary's Garden - this is surrounded on 3 'sides' by hedging and is sealed off by chains but a few inconsiderate people insist on climbing onto the pristine grass for a photo - please do not!Do not miss the fountain or the borders to the North and West of the toilets nearby and opposite the open air theatre.Another place not to miss is the 'Secret Garden' which is properly called St John's Lodge Garden - located on the Inner Circle just North of the junction with Chester road. It is beauftiful and secluded and not visited by many people.If you have more time walk around the Outer Circle to see the unrivalled Regency houses, especially at the Southern end (both East and West). Also look out for the mosque with the gold dome further West and North.Don't bother walking across the sports fields unless you are heading to Camden or the Zoo (or wish to play football or baseball) as there is not much to see. If you do need to walk across the park keep to either the East or West edge as it is more interesting.There are lots of toilets in the park as well as cafes and kiosks and plenty of benches. Bringing your own food to have a picnic is a great idea. If you wish to buy food the cafe in centre of the park (Benugo - The Garden Cafe) is pretty good but expensive. For those die-hard visitors that want to see a bit more head North towards the Zoo and get down onto the Regents Canal. Walking West towards little Venice is very interesting for the superb mansions overlooking the canal with their terraced gardens including the American Ambassadors residence on the North side - look out for the serious railings, the canal boats and the short canal tunnel which you can walk around easily. If you walk East you will soon get to Camden Lock market via a very interesting walk showing how London can change its character within a few hundred metres.Consider walking a little further North from the Zoo area to Primrose Hill and St John's Wood. Great views, lots of shops a restaurants and beautiful houses and people - and not may tourists.Lots of wildlife here - look out for Herons who live on the islands in the boating lake on massive nests - Herons are huge, grey and tame with wings, squirrels - small grey and tame (no wings but sharp teeth) and tame robins and tits. The really tame birds are located within Queen Mary's Gardens and with patience will come to your hand for nuts. The squirrels will climb up your clothing to take nuts from your hands but they can bite so be careful and probably not a good idea for small children who may panic and get bitten. If you are really keen to do this then my tip is to buy peanuts still in their shells - keep your fingers at one end and the squirrel at the other end - this is relatively safe and I have never been bitten. Lots of geese and swans as well."

And you might see one of the many grey squirrels that seem to abound.Lots of people visit but because of the size it never seems too busy."

But even in winter, when the sky was steely and grey and the trees were stripped and bare, the park had something to offer - from Her Majesty's collection of birds around the frozen ponds, to the white fields strewn with sleet.And if that isn't enough, the Zoo and Lord's Cricket ground are located within the perimeter of the park, so a dull day here is hard to come by!"

Regent's Park was close to our hotel so it was very convenient for a quick visit to see the rose beds and other plantings on a Sunday morning before taking the Tube to visit tourist sights in London. I had been to this Park many years ago and was absolutely astounded then with the many rose beds, the healthy rose bushes, and the abundance of blooms. I remember even the flower beds were awash with color - gaudy orange, orange-reds, yellows, reds with the silver white of artemisia. This year in mid-June I was really disappointed in the flower display, especially the rose gardens. Have the number of rose beds been reduced? Have different, smaller growing varieties been planted to replace the 4 footer rose bushes? Some of the plants were either newly planted or just not bushy. There was not an overwhelming color explosion here in the rose garden nor in amongst the other beds. The Grand Avenue, with its twin plantings on either side of the sidewalk, was rather boring to walk along....all green with minimal interest in either good plant combinations or flower color. The one area that did look interesting was the walk around the pond area. From this visit, I don't think I will be so eager in the future to put Regent's Park with its Queen Mary Rose Garden on my \"Must See\" list when in London."

I seen all kinds of sports being played here over the years, and the gardens, Boating lake and bandstand are always well maintained. My only complaint is that there's no tube station close by the North end."

Quiet, peaceful, you can be totally immersed in its wondrous beauty.We spent a full day here with kids, picnicking, boating, playing and strolling among the very well laid out avenue garden (in precisely that order).We reached there around 12 noon on a warm, fortunately clouded day and made our way in from the Lords cricket ground side (where the final day of the India-England match was being played). India won it. Hurrah!!Our first stop was the boat jetty. While walking to it, passed a acrobat training display. Situated next to a nice sit out, we first picnicked with some food brought from home and ice creams bought from the cafe. Thereafter took a 1 hour family ride meant for 2 adults and three children. As we were a party of 3 adults and 3 children with one infant (below 2 years), we had to swap places. Surprisingly the infant was also counted as a child. So, at a time, two adults and three children pedaled their boat under the weeping willows, around the island, where we found the nesting fowls and swarms of geese. Two boats tied to a buoy had been given over to the gulls who had made it their floating home. What an interesting sight? The kids quite enjoyed boating around it.Made our way then to the kids playground, which the youngsters enjoyed hugely, rollicking along the wooden platforms, swinging in the hammock, sliding down the twisting slide.Thereafter, strolled our way to the Avenue garden. Extremely well laid out, with all flowers in full bloom, the gardeners had done a good job, in the variety with a well thought out colored scheme.Finally, a tired party made its way home, passing the Harley Street, Madam Tussaud and Sherlock Holmes Baker street (but more of that some other time).All in all, there is something for everybody. Play grounds for kids, adventure sports for teens, boating for all age groups and stroll in the gardens for the elderly."

The pedalos were great fun but very poor customer service! There were queues to hire them out which I do not understand as it doesn't take long to process the transaction, so I'm not sure why the attendant was being so slow. He was obviously a bit flustered as we had to keep repeating what we wanted as he wasn't listening properly. After, we had to queue up to get our \u00a35 deposit back. The attendant actually left the till point and disappeared for a good 5 mins with no explanation whatsoever. Very odd! But the pedalos itself were very enjoyable."

Not that we have any problem with the winter when you can find more solitude at this Royal Park, but Regent's Park really comes alive and shows its best stuff during the warmer months. During the summer, the lake is full of waterfowl, young chicks and paddle-boaters casually enjoying their time on the water. Another benefit to summer visits is that the Open Air Theatre is in session so you can enjoy outdoor performances in the evening. Further, if you visit during early June, you can see the excellent Queen Mary Rose Garden in full bloom. This is a treat in an of itself and something that we greatly miss when passing through Regent's park during winter visits. Overall, we highly rate Regent's Park during the summer when the Open Air Theatre and Queen Mary Rose Garden able to be seen and enjoyed. This is one of the Royal Parks that is well worth spending time during summer visits to London."

The first is the lake. Here you can see waterfowl of all kinds including tame herons and between Easter and October hire a rowing boat or pedal boat. The second is the Queen Mary's Gardens , which has wonderful roses from May to February when the roses are pruned. This also has a small lake and waterfall, a cafe and the famous open air theatre, Thirdly there is the area with the English gardens, there are walks here with poplar trees, fountains and flowerbeds . Fourthly there is the sports field , with a good dog walking area nearby.Finally there is Primrose Hill adjacent to the park, from which you can command great views of London after a healthy walk uphill. Here when it snows you can see people with sleds, sliding down. There are various events in Regents Park throughout the year, for instance the sculptures which are free, byond the Frieze art exhibition whuch costs. There are also fairs and other events. The park is suitable for all ages, including good children's playgrounds and easy walks and benches for 90 year olds."

After visiting the Wallace Collection at Manchester Square I walked up Baker Street towards Marylebone Rd. A couple blocks north beyond the huge Baker Street Station (Circle Line-yellow, Hammersmith and City Line-pink, Jubilee Line-grey, Bakerloo Line-brown, and Metropolitan Line-violet) after you've strolled by the Beatles Store and the Sherlock Holmes Museum you can enter Clarence Gate into Regent's Park. This is the southwest corner of Regent's Park. I have to say that so far Regent's Park has the most impressive blooms (both trees and flowers) of any park I've seen so far in London. The boating lake also has a wide variety of ducks and geese. If you walk past Regents University to Queen Mary's Gardens (there was a lot of work going on but not many flowers visible) there is a caf\u00e9 with good and reasonably priced food. I ducked out of a springtime shower and enjoyed a pear salad at the caf\u00e9. The caf\u00e9 is also a great place for a restroom break although there are public restrooms on Chester Road heading towards the eastern entrance/exit of the park. Rather than exit the east side of the park I diverted south through an impressive mall of flower plantings towards the south east exit. There I found the Regents Park Station (Bakerloo-brown line). At the north end of the park is the London Zoo but I did not visit. Regents Park is a nice place to get away from the urban frenetic activity and noise. It is a credit to Westminster and I recommend a visit."

Regent's Park is located just north of Marylebone and is one of London's largest public spaces, covering 395 acres of green space. Locally renowned for its high quality sporting facilities, gardens and Open-Air theatre, this makes one of the best park visits in the city during the Summer months. Probably one of the most popular attractions at Regent's Park is Queen Mary's Gardens, which are vibrant with colour during the warmer months of Summer. At this time, you can see thousands upon thousands of roses in bloom. A visit during June can be particularly rewarding for rose lovers. During winter months, the gardens are expectedly bare. There is also a nice lake in the park, providing boating recreation and place to see birdlife. Many varieties of waterfowl make use of the lake and they are quite active here during the summer, might be due to the number of people trying to feed them at these times. Another enjoyable activity at Regent's Park during the Summer months is the Open-Air Theatre found here. Between mid-May to mid-September, you can watch theatre performances under the evening sky and stars. This is just great fun and a nice way to spend time outside. Lastly, the London City Zoo can be found on the north side of Regent's Park along with a nice water canal and running track. Overall, there is quite a bit to see and do at Regent's Park but we feel it lends itself better to Summer visits compared to visiting during the colder periods of the year. The Gardens and Open-Air Theatre are two major reasons for visiting and they can't be enjoyed during the winter. As such, we sort of feel that Regent's Park is a hit during the summer but a miss during the winter time. Hint: Regent's Park can be accessed easily by the Regent's Park or Baker Street Tube Stations and there is a Garden Cafe near Queen Mary's Gardens. Hint: Fun activities in the area beyond the park include the Sherlock Holmes Museum, Beetles Shop and Madame Tussaud Museum."

Regent's Park is a stunning venue for picnicking, as a Londoner it is a fantastic after work destination as it is easy to reach from most areas of the city.The gardens, statues and fountains are worth seeking out, as well as a variety of food shops and kiosks.One of my favourite spots in the city, my only wish being that the park was kept open after dusk in the summer as London can remain quite hot. However, Primrose Hill is just a short walk away for night-time picnicking under pretty street lamps."

En route to London Zoo we took a taxi from Baker St Station, a really worthwhile \"scenic tour\" of this carefully conserved area..Exiting the Zoo, we sat for a while to enjoy the views from a seat by the path, then crossed the inner ring and went over the bridge on the Canal, observing tourist barges and the Chinese restaurant..Experience was made even nicer by the bus driver who waited for us to catch up with him, the passenger who offered me a seat, and the further scenic journey back to Baker St Station, where the bus pulled up conveniently right outside the station door!.I would say that for anyone spending more than a few days in London, at least half a day could be usefully spent on buses or on foot, ambling around the area and refreshing the lungs, not to mention enjoying the beauty of the Park..Now I am wondering about a canal trip?"

We only went into regents park in all honesty because we were going to the zoo and due to them working on the nothern line on the underground we came from baker street tube instead of campden town. However Im glad we did this is really nice green space in the middle of London. there is a nice boating pond which also has ducks and swans. Just one tip if you stop and go in your bag for something watch out for the local wild life I stopped to get my camera out my bag and was surrounded by the local duck population who clearly thought I had food for them. This park is well used by the locals and tourist alike but is still quiet and relaxing."

Whilst the fair charges to see the exhibits, it is totally free to see the Sculpture Park with some really amazing artworks this year - see my pics - especially Jaume Plensa's 'Chloe' huge bronzed sculpture, whose face is perhaps the most photographed sculpture in the park.

There are a few very nice cafe's, like the healthfood cafetaria The Honest Sausage and plenty of public toilets.

It's a chance to taste small tapas sized plates of food served up by Michelin starred chefs, as well as buy artisanal produce. It's a foodie's dream. Stalls are dotted around the park, each with taster plates from dishes each chef serves in their respective restaurants. Le Gavroch (the famous Michelin restaurant started by the culinary royalty that are the Rouxs) were there serving up some of their classics like Pork Belly with Black Pudding and Tomato spiced Jus. The festival works on the principal that no money exchanges hands. Instead you buy crowns. The value of a single crown is 50p. Dishes vary between 6 and 16 crowns so you need a good amount of crowns to get the most out of the experience. I'd say around 30 per person could work. So effectively each dish averages at around \u00a36. It's not cheap, so it's fair to say that you have to be very food orientated to part with \u00a36 for 4 spoons of food.We had a variety of things but we didn't go crazy. My husband loved the White Chocolate Pannacotta from Alyn Williams restaurant The Westbury. He also liked Alyd's Braised Beef Cheek, which was very rich but tender as hell. We did think the fact they said it lay on a bed of Baked Potato Foam was a little pretentious (it was just mash), however what do you expect when eating dishes from some of the worlds best restaurants?Other things we enjoyed were the seared Scallops from Theo Randall and the Monkfish Kebab from The Savoy.The weather was typical. It started off relatively warm and towards the end was a little windy and cold. Nonetheless it's a real experience and a joy if you want to taste food from restaurants you may otherwise not have the chance to go to.Taste of London10/10Regents ParkLondonhttp://london.tastefestivals.com/london/default.aspx"

This is my favourite of the royal parks in central London, and like the others, is large enough for you to forget you are in the middle of a bustling city. I used to come here often when I was a student in London and lived nearby. The park is beautifully maintained all year round and has a variety of scenery all within fairly close walking distance; lush grassy areas, a rose garden in summer, lakes with little scenic bridges going over them, an open air theatre in summer (book in advance as tickets are hot!), a boating lake, a separate (and very large) area for people who want to play football and other sports. Perfect for picnics, lazing around reading a book, playing football/frisbee/rounders etc with friends, romantic (or other) walks, walking your dog, jogging, cycling around the rounds that run around the park.Regents Park Zoo is also nearby. (A paid attraction. Also recommended for a family day out.) Primrose Hill is within walking distance (allow 15-25 minutes) for a great view of London from the top of the hill.In terms of access and amenities, there are two tube stations fairly nearby (Baker Street and Regents Park stations) and there are shops near those stations where you can pick up snacks on the way. The park also has public toilets and a cafe, and maps near each entrance in case you get disorientated. Note: As I recall, the cafe is small, so if you want a proper meal and havent brought a picnic with you, you will have to venture outside of the park to a restaurant or supermarket.On hot sunny days the park can get incredibly busy with sunbathers out en masse. But this is the same for all London Parks and Squares and you may need to go out to Greenwich or beyond if you want a bit of space to yourself. I prefer the park when it is less busy in misty Spring when the buds are opening and the ducklings are out or in golden, crunchy-leafed Autumn when the squirrel are gathering their nuts. The park is particularly beautiful when the seasons are changing. You forget you're in the middle of the city and can enjoy a miniature taste of the glorious English countryside."

There was also a beautiful lake upon entering the York gate, to the left, with many different birdlife, benches to rest on, and beautiful landscape, We walked across the park to get to the exit at Gloucester gate, this part of the park is an empty green space, where many groups of people were playing football/volleyball/rugby, taking their dog for a walk or jogging or just lazing around- it was a Saturday, so there were many locals out and about.

The park as a whole is fantastic - however the information on the website is not up to date.We had planned a visit to Regent's Park in order to go boating (rowing boats) as part of a birthday celebration. Having located the boating lake and boat hire area we tried to hire a rowing boat only to be told that they only have pedalos. When I commented that the website listed rowing boats (checked only the day before), I got a rather unexpected sarcastic response 'well the website says a lot of things'. Not helpful! Next time we will fork out the higher price and go to Hyde Park instead."

There is a separate garden devoted solely to roses - of breathtaking colors and varieties. I was lucky enough that my cousin, Florrie, her husband, Danny and their two beautiful daughters, Esse and Bekka, live not far away from this park. I not only enjoyed this very lovely park, I also had so much fun with the girls feeding the birds at the pond!"

But today we visited Regent's Park, Regent's Canal, the open air theatre and Camden Lock. Absolutely loved them all and would highly recommend. On the canal we used the London waterways bus (note, no commentary, whereas I think Jason's Trip services do have a commentary). Took this from Maida Vale to Camden Lock. Lovely scenic, very peaceful, journey. A shame that the graffiti along the way isn't cleaned off, as this could be such a beautiful trip. A very easy walk too away from the crowds and the roads. Camden Lock - well worth a visit, very eccentric. Every sort of food to be sampled! Lots of craft stalls. Regent's Park was the highlight for us though - lots of different areas, beautifully planted borders, huge open spaces with people playing sport or picnicking. Lovely boating late, the rose gardens were so fragrant and beautiful - and almost the entire time if you did a full 360 you could not see a road, or a building - you could be in the country side! Lovely to watch the world go by. We went to the theatre in the evening - our first time - and it was magical. Stunning setting (we saw the Sound of Music, which was amazing), beautiful evening, delightful. I'd go back in a heartbeat. If it's rained the night before though, take a plastic bag to sit on as the chairs have cushions and they are wet! All round, a really beautiful and interesting part of London."

There is a lake that meanders through the west and southwest of the park, filled with ducks, geese, swan and herons. Part of the lake also has boating for couples and families.

Wide open spaces to wander, play and picnic; the Serpentine for the energetic; the wonderful performances at the Open Air Theatre which are an absolute MUST - every year is different, every performance is enthralling and the sets are brilliantly professionally innovative! We saw \"Ragtime\" last summer and were moved by the moving performance. The rose gardens ... on a warm summer day the fragrance is heady and the roses wonderful ... a sea of glorious blooms - heaven! Of course, there are play areas and lots, lots more ... you'll just have to go yourself - it's free and there's always something different to see ... and there's so much more (the Zoo for a start)!"

Regents Park is also a quiet and pleasant place to take a long walk and spend the day. Easy to reach: 10 minutes walk from Baker Street tube station. I heartily recommend to those who like spending time in the open."

The parking for the meter was \u00a32.40 per hour (August 2012 prices) so expensive if you want to stay in the park for more than a couple of hours.The park has plenty of space to roam in & it is great for walking dogs or for children to run around in. There is quite a big lake in the park with loads of ducks on, so a lovely pastime for small children. Watch out for the herons, they are as tame as the ducks & we couldn't get over how close to them you could actually get.We walked along the back of the zoo & could see a couple of meerkats in their enclosure.........a great free way to compare the meerkat!"

It's a stone's throw from Baker Street tube station, and you quickly become detached from the hustle and bustle of London and enter leafy green surroundings. We did more or less a full circuit of the place, taking in the boating lake (nice little caf\u00e9 there by the water's edge), and Primrose Hill, which is well worth the climb to the top, where there are superb views of Central London with the usual landmarks. There are plenty of places to stop off, have a drink and watch the world go by. The Zoo is also very handy if this is your thing. We liked it so much we came back a week later and made a slight variation by walking along the Regent's Canal which skirts the northern edge of the Park. This area is highly recommended on a fine sunny day, especially if you're staying in the West End and want to \"get away from it all\" for an hour or two."

I most enjoy coming in the early mornings when I feel I'm a part of a secret runners society -- puffs of breath can be seen beckoning each fellow runner's anticipated step, and it seems that the park was built just for us. Perfect for a 6 or 8k jog, there is something amusing to stare at around every turn which makes the time fly. Just be aware of this running euphoria or before you know it, it will backfire with a nasty stress fracture from all that pavement pounding. Nothing romantic about that, now is there?"

At least one recent production has transferred to the West End -these are great productions which use the setting and gathering darkness to great effect. I've seen both Ragtime and Midsummer Night's Dream this season and they were both terrific. Take a jumper, a blanket for your knees and a raincoat, just in case. If the play is totally rained off, you get a ticket for another night. There is a hog roast and a bar. You will never forget seeing a show here.

There's a zoo, fields for sports and so on, but I like the top of the park, where you can walk along the canals. In fact, you can go for quite a while. Just above, and connecting to the park is Primrose Hill, where you can get beautiful views. Right off Primrose Hill, you'll get to a 4 or 5 block crescent street with small, casual, but very nice cafes and shops."

I saw on the television this week that there will be open-air performances of Shakespeare's 'A Mid-Summer Night's Dream' on at Regent's Park, London during the Olympic Games season. In the summer of 1946 (that's right), my parents took me to see the same open-air production at Regent's Park. It was unforgettable and I strongly recommend parents visiting London to take their children for an experience they will remember throughout their life. Needless to say, the adults will enjoy themselves too. When we went we were accommodated on chairs placed on the ground. I think seating arrangements are such these days that more people are provided for. Interestingly, unknown to us a photograph of us had been sent to a newspaper in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) which had published it with the caption 'Indian family at open-air play in Regent's Park'. (I am marking that our visit was in August 2011 since 1946 is not provided for!)"

One of the real delights about Regent's is that if you keep exploring you will find a new little treat around the each corner, from gardens, to ponds, to fountains, to sculptures. The key features to see would be the Hub, Queen Mary's Rose Gardens, the Inner Circle and the Avenue Gardens. The park is a runner's paradise with constantly changing scenery and easy ways to navagate. Sportsman abound everywhere. The gardens are well manicured and there are multiple features to see throughout the park. The cafes are nice, and I especially liked the one at the Hub and the Honest Sausage. You can catch a play at the open theater if your timing is good. Don't miss the chance to see neighboring Primrose Hill for the best natural view of London in the city, by my opinion. There are two institutions that are located on the grounds, Regent's College (a private college) and the LZS Zoo for a look at some wildlife. Not quite the scale of New York's Central Park (Hyde would be closer), but well worth a Sat. afternoon stoll."

The Rose Garden, in the Inner Circle, is especially beautiful & restful - it is exceptionally well maintained. As well as the famous Rose Garden, with a wide variety of Roses, the rest of the Inner Circle has been beautifully landscaped with many species of flower beds, waterfall and fountain. There are lots of lovely spots to have picnics. The Cafeteria and restaurant are okay - not great, but handy for a soft drinks / ice cream for the kids, sandwiches etc. Queen Mary's Garden is also lovely, it is in the OUTER circle, there are lots of benches to sit on, rest and relax. There are areas in the outer circle to play football, frisbee etc. ( no ball games allowed in the Inner Circle). During the summer the bandstand plays music most afternoons and there is a boating lake. The Outdoor Theatre is virtually all Shakespeare plays, when the weather is good it gets completely sold out - so always best to book in advance. The Theatre is lovely, nice food and a great buzz... albeit a bit too busy for my liking. It's nice to take your own picnic. It's best to get there using public transport - there isn't a lot of parking, however if you must go by car - then make sure you 'pay & display' as the wardens are pretty vigilant and parking is expensive."

London Zoo is there, and if you walk north you will be on Regents Canal in no time, and you can walk for miles along the tow path.Spend the day here! Wonderful!"

There's also lovely bird life here, the lakes and streams are very pretty, and very pleasant to walk around or sit and picnic by in the summer. Try going mid week as it gets busy on a sunny weekend.It's also home to the open air theatre (though its prime location doesn't always mean it has great productions!), the zoo is there and you can see a few of the less exotic animals from part of the park, and you also have some stunning houses around the park perimeter.It's a massive park though, so if your time is limited maybe enter near Baker St or Hyde Park tube stations and stick to the bit with the lake and stuff."

This is one of the Royal Parks that is beautifully maintained. 400 acres of greenery in Central London is a bonus and it is divided up into many factions so that visitors dont just have one flat green space. The Rose Garden is beloved by the middle easterners; the Secret Garden (next door to the Sultan of Brunei's summer palace) is sensational. There is a wonderful vegetable and herb garden that can be visited; Queen Mary's Gardens is full of unusual plants; the Open Air Theatre regularly puts on wonderful plays and musicals. We saw \"Crazy for You\" there before it transferred to the West End. The lake is great for hiring a skiff and rowing up and down. It is full of migratory birds that spend their summers and winters here. Some of the varieties of ducks and geese on the lake are stunning. There is a Heronry and a tree that is a bedroom to 58 Cormorants (where do they go to during the day?) The country walk is full of wild flowers and fruits and Cricket corner is home to an apiary that produces Regent's Park honey. Only downside are the two cafes - The Honest Sausage and The Hub - both places have dreadful service and very grumpy staff. Someone please tell them that service with a smile brings in revenue. London Zoo is nearby and if you stand on the north corner pathway from the small monument, you can watch some of the animals that are roaming in their pens. You can hear lions roaring and the lemurs making their plaintive calls to one another. Its a magic place to have a picnic, stroll and enjoy some fresh air."

It is so relaxing and time takes on a different quality as you row gently around in the water, close to the ducks and swans. They generously admit you to their world which might be just as stressful to them as our world is to us, but they serve as a wonderful metaphor for how life could be lived and enjoyed (when in doubt, stick your bottom in the air and come back upright having caught a tasty morsel, or spend time preening and grooming until you look sleek and gorgeous!)  There is an outdoor swimming lake reserved for women, and one for men. Plenty of food on offer, or space to have your own picnics. Many years ago, I did the Race for Life in Hampstead Heath and in the 90 degree heat it felt like every part of the path/track was uphill. Since then, I have switched allegiance to the Regents Park track and this is far more civilised, seemingly all on the flat. Still work up a healthy appetite for the picnic our men have prepared, though!This is a beautiful Park, with manicured expanses of lawns and carefully tended flower beds, in which it is a pleasure to spend one's leisure."

My wife and I spent 8 days in London between crossings on the QM2 and decided to see Regent's Park for the first time in many visits to the city on a sunny Sunday outing. It is convenient to get to from a couple of buslines and the Baker Street tube station. Unlike Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, it is away from the noise and relatively uncrowded. It's a great place to unwind. Just stay away from nearby Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, particularly on a weekend. The crowd out front was huge. In the park there are numerous areas to stroll or just sit on comfortable benches and watch the people go by. There was an outdoor Hindu wedding going on when we were there with singing and colorful costumes. The Garden Restaurant was an unexpected high point - the prices were typical London - you know, same numerals but in pounds instead of dollars. That said, my wife and I had probably our best meal of the trip there. I had a ribeye steak dinner that was fantastic and she loved the sticky toffee pudding. Don't miss the park or the restaurant."

It never ceases to amaze me that there are 410 acres of beautiful tranquil gardens right in the heart of London. The Park is situated in the middle of St Pancras, Marylebone, Paddington and Primrose Hill. So it\u2019s an ideal place to visit if you are spending time near Baker Street, Madame Tussauds, London Zoo, Camden etc.I would highly recommend viewing the website before you visit, as I find this quite informative and you will be able to plan your trip to suit your preferences. Personally I like the south side of the park, which you can easily access from Regents Park Station or Great Portland Street Station. On the South west side of the gardens you have the boating lakes, on the south side of the garden there are Queen Mary\u2019s gardens, which are lovely and on the south east side of the gardens you have the Avenue Gardens and the English Gardens. All of these areas are extremely pretty and you could easily spend a few hours just in these places.For me one of the best ways to spend time in the park, is to wonder down Marylebone high street first, pick up some food from one of the lovely deli\u2019s and go and have a picnic in the park. If you sit around the more popular areas e.g. the boating lakes, then it can get quite busy. However if you find some of the quieter tucked away gardens, you can end up without seeing other people for ages, which is lovely and tranquil.Regents Park is a lovely place for everyone to visit, whether you are exercising, walking, relaxing, looking for garden inspiration or even specialising in photography, there is something for everyone."

The attractions in the park include London Zoo, but the main attraction is the park itself. It is a very popular picnic spot for the locals and on summer weekends there are usually a few wedding couples having their pictures taken among the roses in Queen Mary's Gardens.The roses are in bloom during the warmer months (normally May-July) and it is wondrous to walk among them, noticing the smells of all the different varieties represented. In the norht part of the park, there are sporting areas where local football leagues will have their matches on Sundays.If you are keen on aquatic activities, you can also rent rowing or pedal boats and go around the boating lake.There are also a couple of hot dog stand-type places to eat and the Garden Caf\u00e9, which is a proper sit-down caf\u00e9 and restaurant.All in all, a marvellous place to spend a sunny summer afternoon."

London is really a great town if for anything then because if you get tired of all the life bustling and boiling in it you can move away from it for a hour or a two and in the same time not leave it. To do so you just have to visit a park, and a good choice would be Regent's Park and especially the Primrose Hill just next to it (or you can take it as a part of it).Regent's park is a great green peace of land to take a stroll, have a drink in the cafe, play sports and so on. But the best experience for me was when we climbed the Primrose Hill (don't let this CLIMB word scare you, there is just about minute or two climbing), the hill provides a view on the whole town, you can explore the panorama of a huge town in one peace, and for a town as big as London this sure is a spectacular view.Primrose hill is a great place for a picnic or just sit on the grass (or on a bench) and relax... and enjoy the view over London."

The most beautiful park in London, and, probably in the world.Offers many activities - several kid's playgrounds, boating lake, botanical garden, tennis courts, rugby and soccer pitches.Zoo is right within the park bounds, but it's a subject of it's own review. Also in the summer London open air theater, also located inside the park, is an absolute must. Enjoy a Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde play preceded by a champagne picnic. Does not get any better than that.A few Boris bike stations are scattered around the park, which is nice, although there is no cycling on the park paths.If you're into running - a run around the park is about 5k, a very enjoyable run.I had lived in London for 3.5 years with kids, and now I come here 10-20 times a year. Not having grown up here, we had built our experience by trial and error, so I consider myself a bit of an expert on London, and Regent's park is at the top of the list of London parks."

Regent's Park is one of several Royal Parks that unleashes new beauty as the seasons progress. Regent's offers paddle boating (fee based service), an excellent place for photography and a great place to sit and relax (fee based service). Regent's is a large park. There is a rose garden, an entire university, an open air theatre and a cafe within its limits. It is a very peaceful place and is always full of people. Like the rest of London the feel is very safe!"

This place is so peaceful and relaxing, it's hard to imagine that it is in the middle of London. The garden was filled with roses of every color and shape that you could imagine. My wife said that you could just float on the smell of the flowers. I can't imagine what the garden must look like in the middle of the summer with it being still this grand this late in the year. We made our way to a little tea shop in the garden and although it was cold and cloudy we sat outside and enjoyed a hot cup of English Tea. This was my wife's favorite spot during our trip to London."

The Park itself is an excellent place to wander around and have a lazy afternoon. This year the programme seems interesting with A Mid Summers Nights Dream and Alice in Wonderland being part of the session. Don't forget there is London Zoo close by, as are Madame Tausauds and the Planetarium. And not very far is the Wallace Colletion towards Oxford Street, which has recently been renovated including a fine cafe and restaurant. I've been converted to the place over the last three years and have always had a brilliant time. But, take a brolly just in case !"

I have been to this park twice this year, both times on sunny summer days, once in the evening and once in the afternoon. On both occasions the park was beautifully maintained and well used. We witnessed several small groups of people playing games and people relaxing on both visits too and there was a really great atmosphere. On my second visit we walked up Primrose Hill, which I would highly recommend for the views of the City. You could sit in certain locations in this park and not believe you were in the centre of London. I would recommend this park for the views and for relaxation."

I admit it was on a perfect Autumn day that my husband and I strolled around the park, but to see the trees in their Autumn colours, the delightful and well-tended gardens, it was a sheer delight. The walk along part of Regents canal was so peaceful and at one stretch of the canal, there was only the 2 of us walking along! I found that unreal on a sunny Saturday afternoon, and in London too!Just to sit and people watch was fun - joggers, strollers, dog-walkers, volley-ball players and a rugby game, was just the perfect way to relax and unwind before getting ready to hit the chaos of the rest London."

Different parts of the park look different and have their own particular charm, which is something that draws me back to it again and again. The Avenue Gardens with the rows of pretty flowers and fountains are brilliant to stroll through, and Queen Mary's Gardens with the roses and ducks are really pretty as well. Do bring some bread if you would like to feed the ducks, geese, swans etc that are to be found in the ponds/ lake here! It's lots of fun, especially if you have kids (though that's really an activity for all ages!) You can go on a paddle boat or row boat on the boating lake. Going on the boat before noon will give you about one pound discount (they count the fees per head on the boat, so you could make some substantial savings). There is an open-air theatre in the park, which i haven't been to, but from all accounts it's pretty good (stages Shakespeare stuff etc). The London Zoo is also located in the park, which could also make for a very nice day out (it really is a good zoo!), combined with general park strolling. Near the London Zoo at the north end of the park is Regent's Canal. Following the canal, you will be able to walk to either Camden Town (for Camden Lock Market- quirky market stalls and great atmosphere!) or Little Venice (this is near Paddington, it's rather nice but i didn't find it overly impressive), depending on which direction you take. The Canal Route is clearly marked. At the north end of the park, across a tiny road is Primrose Hill, and there is a brilliant panoromic view over London from the summit. It's not a very tall hill, really, and it's an easy climb to the top! Rather worth the (little) effort. All in all, there's good reason why I love this park! Do make time to visit it, especially if you happen to be in London longer than the time it takes to cover the basics (big ben, london eye etc). I ought to let you know that at the moment there is a little project called the Treehouse Gallery up near the boating lake at the park. This consists of a creative little space where volunteers host events such as puppet workshops and poetry readings. There are also 2 treehouses up there at the moment, and a number of swings/ net rope thingies. Great for kids and for adults as well! At the moment the Treehouse Gallery is due to be dismantled in September 2009, so do swing by there if you get the chance! it's something really different and fresh, and a brilliant idea and initiative. helped a man make his twig puppet for a puppet show to be held there in a couple of weeks. really enjoyed myself. :)"

The park team must be dedicated souls, tending to some formal gardens while resisting the urge to cut down wild plant reas, thus encouraging insects for the benefit of the park's huge range of bird life. I have never seen so many heron anywhere, a bird you normally associate with wild spaces in the UK.Definitely worth a visit: take in the Honest sausage for lunch or a late breakfast, organic fayre is served."
