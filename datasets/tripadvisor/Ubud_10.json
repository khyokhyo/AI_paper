I loved this place and went for a walk there most days, Its so green and nice, Also on the left when you enter there is a guy selling coconuts and he goes and picks them fresh for you and sometimes sells coconut oil and its the best i have bought in Bali. `i went to a warung to the left but it was nothing special and double the price of the local Warungs, But its not very big but good to see it take about 20 mins from central Ubud so its not far.Also bought a few things on my way up there some presents and clothes from the women on the left side they give you good prices and do not make much money as most people shop in the market, but i got very good prices from them better than the market and they are so nice. They all have families and children and sometimes i sat with them for a couple hours and ask them about family life in Ubud and they work very hard indeed. B=They are also very beautiful ladies. its the the first lot of stalls just before lotus meditation Centre. Jalan Kajeng is a very nice street and some cool places to stay and central ubud but very quiet. My favourite place to stay as i stayed here for 5 months.:)))"

We had a scooter, so walked from our villa, but saw a lot of people walking up the slope out of breathe. The walk is lovely, great spot to take photos, don't forget your insect repellant, lots of bugs about, you come across plenty of Warungs for a drink, and also along the walk is located the number one rated restaurant in ubud Lux Cafe."

The road is a subscription road, with every square meter having been purchased by individual families or local businesses at the time the cement was done. The road curves left at the top. Go up the hill and park your motorcycle and continue on foot out into the ricefields. If you are lucky with the clouds, you can see Gunung Agung on the NorthEast direction, or at least part of it. Along the way, local sharecropper farmers will be happy to climb a coconut treat to bring you a coconut. In about 40 minutes walk, if you bear left, you will find yourself coming down in the Campuhan neighborhood. Or you can of course retrace and retreat down Jalan Kajeng. Cold drinks at Starbucks where Jalan Kajeng meets Jalan Raya, or ice cream and cold drinks at the Lotus Restaurant next to Starbucks."

It can get busy in parts where motorbikes share the pathway but further along the path narrows and you will only pass other walkers as you meander around the rice fields."

The inclined pathway leading to the rice fields is very narrow, and because it had rained heavily 2 days earlier, the pathway was still very wet and muddy in some areas. Unfortunately, my teenage daughter did slip and fall in the sloped, slippery mud. The pathway later, while still only a few feet wide, had a very steep drop off on one side, so considerable care is needed while walking.Once reaching the rice fields, the walkway is very level and safe. We walked a loop through the rice fields and exited on Jl Kajeng road, which we walked on to get back to Jl Raya Ubud by Starbucks.The rice fields are very expansive. We went in the late afternoon, and saw the sunset over the trees in the distance. The temperature was cool at the time. At dusk, I was bitten by at least one mosquito, so wearing repellent is also advised."

It is quite amazing that such a beautiful place exists literally 10 minutes from the busy streets of Ubud. The farmers are working in the fields, and there are ducks and birds everywhere. And along the way there is a fabulous Caf\u00e9, the Sweet Orange Caf\u00e9 (Warung). Time your visit to stop here for something to eat or drink. The food is awesome and it is so serene and quiet. To go on this walk, walk down the road between Starbucks and the Temple (Jalan Kajeng). It is a nice walk of itself. Keep following it until you walk up a small hill, and then you will be in the rice fields. After a while you come to a path that goes off to the left (and has a Sweet Orange sign). Follow this around and you end up back on the main road, about 80m down the hill from where you started. DONT miss this walk when in Ubud. It is well worthwhile."

It's a lovely view of rice fields with friendly farmers working the fields then a bit of jungle (keep going, you haven't taken a wrong turn!). Just make sure you walk carefully as there are a few steep drops. Highly recommend stopping at Sari Organik for a drink/meal towards the end.

I ended up walking it 1.5 times because I didn't understand how it is laid out. If you walk up Jl Kajeng (very easy to find, street is labelled, the street has concrete pavers with messages written on the whole way) then you are already on the walk. You don't turn down any alley. You just keep walking all the way to the end of the street (a decent distance). When you get to my photo, go up where it says no car and the walk begins for real. Unfortunately I thought it was a dead end and turned around here and went all the way back and started from the other end, opposite Casa Luna restaurant. This entrance is clearly labelled rice fields and has about 150m of small paths before you get out to the rice fields"

After getting through that bit however, it becomes much different, MUCH better.You amble along a decent path through verdant rice fields (hence the name!) and the occasional dwelling or warung (cafe), the latter providing a stop for refreshment or seated viewing of your surrounds. (\"Sweet Orange Warung\" looked particularly inviting.) The circuit isn't long and the whole thing took maybe 40 minutes or so, plus stops.

It's kinda amazing.From the lively streets of Ubud you walk into a small alley, around a wall and Poff!You're traveled back 30 years and are walking among rice fields, not on a large road, but a little pathway.After a while one or two cafes or restaurants pops up in the middle of the rice fields where you can enjoy a fresh juice of almost any fruit there is for as low as 15k and take a rest in the shadow while you enjoy the scenery and stillness."

I would suggest that you would need to be fairly fit, because when you get down and take it all in, you have no way but to start the trek up. It looks like hard work, and not for the faint hearted. When you are about to go down, keep an eye out for the old man where you can get your photo take for about 2000 ruppies and you can wear his hat and hold the pole and 2 baskets. Not a bad look. Otherwise it is very beautiful and great for photos."

You walk Kajeng street, round the bend, go over a bridge and walk up a hill to the ridge. There you go right along a small gang lined by coconut palms, you get the feeling of how Bali use to be. That is until you get to the new hotel that's been built. But even with that it's a beautiful walk where you can see reflections of village life. Roosters and hens, along with chicks roam freely. The occasional snake. The local Balinese tending the rice fields, the rice always at a different stage, so the feel is changing with the cycle of the season. There's a local selling fresh coconuts so do partake. The juice is delicious and best of all, nutritious. Others selling paintings or other things to earn some money.On a clear day you can see Mt. Agung (the navel of the world for the Balinese) on the right and on the left the mountain range that starts with Batu Karu and runs northwest through the National Park.Bali is even more wonderful when you get off the beaten track and it doesn't take much to do just that. Enjoy!"

Some nice views of the rice paddy fields can be seen on this easy walk. 10 minutes in and I felt as if I was transported to a different world - a world that is the contrast to the crowded and noisy streets of Ubud. However having stayed in Sidemen (a small village about 1.5 hours drive away) before arriving in Ubud, I must say this walk was only a small sample of what quiet and peaceful can be. Highly recommend visiting Sidemen if you appreciate these scenery and want to have a real experience of the peaceful Balinese countryside."

Peering down the alleyway you think this must be a mistake, trust me, it's not. This walk takes you into a dimension of peace and solitude. I completed the full walk which is easily indicated on one of the local tourist maps. It is marked with the dotted line and the full trek probably took about 4 hours with a bit of a break for lunch at Luxe Cafe. I encourage anyone to take this walk if you like nature. It will change soon, as they are already building more villas in the middle of this walk. Take this opportunity now before it changes too much."

Total about 8k walk. Great walking early in the morning before tourist traffic steps up. There is nothing really open at this time but a lovely time to get a sense of villagers waking up and going about their daily lives. Fabulous escape from Ubud traffic at this time in the morning, only a couple of scooters going past until you get closer to town.

This walk pretty much joins all three into a single experience that allows you to see first hand the hardship life farmers have, the beautify of the scenery and the art these people can create. Truly inspiring walk; well worth your time before sunset.I highly recommend to do it close to sunset as you will get to see the rice fields with proper day light but also its beautiful transition into the golden hour to then the pink colours filling the sky. There is also lots of talented painters using traditional techniques to recreate the rice fields or their protector Ganesh (an elephant headed deity) reproduced with intricate details. You will also find some restaurants/cafe's were to take a seat to enjoy the view.Take with you plenty of water (about half to one litre per person), sunscreen (depending on the hour) and lots of mozzie repellent. Oh, and a flash light would be good as well as the road get irregular at times.Longer story:After walking up and down (or east to west) of Ubud at 4:00 - 4:30pm we decided to go for a short walk around the nearby rice fields in preparation for the \"Campuhan Ridge Walk\". One of the good things of staying in \u201cAbangan Bungalow\u201d is its close proximity to the entrance of the rice fields/terraces, so we took water with us, a little bit of insect repellent and off we went.The entrance does not look like much and you got to pay good attention to motorbike\u2019s horn as locals will be travelling from/to the rice fields, but if you continue moving forwards eventually you will find yourself surrounded by some beautiful landscape, lots of rice, farmers working pretty hard to get their crops going (don\u2019t take picture of them unless you are ready to pay some money), artists painting and some truly beautiful sunsets.If you go in December sunset will happen at some point between 6pm to 6:45pm, meaning you need to start walking around 4 to take a good look, find a spot where to look the sunset and grab a bite. I love photography, which made this walk even more enjoyable, the golden hour starts 15 minutes before sunset, giving you a different perspective of the landscape.Some restaurants/caf\u00e9 around will provide mozzie repellent, but don\u2019t count on it as there are plenty of people walking around and it goes quickly when it rained a few days before.Finally but not least, this walk gave us perspective\u2026 You (and lots of other tourists) are walking around right next to farmers, when done at the right time you see them wrapping up their day, meaning they get to get their shower/bath for the day right on the stream irrigating the rice fields, they do not have comfortable lives, water at home or money as the matter of fact, the rice fields are their source of income, food, water and enjoyment; yet they are happy when you walk next to them. Smile at them once and they will immediately smile back, say hi (they know few English words: hi, thanks, sorry, please and no-money are the common ones) and tilt their heads in a friendly way. We got to talk to some artists and farmers, really good people. If you want to get the human side of Ubud (and you should) talk to them, try to help them as tourists are their way of getting a life a bit easier."

You can go from Jalan Kajeng or follow Rice Paddy sign near the Lotus Cafe and temple along Jalan Raya, or further up towards Sari Organik and they can all be loops.

In the morning you see single file lines of tourists being led. It boggles my mind. Why pay for something that is both free and super easy to access, and who wants the distraction of being caught in a group? Okay I'm elitist, but that kind of tourism is a disease."

Follow the directions as stated by a prior reviewer - right at Abangan Bungalows turn off west along Jl Rayan Ubud, then second left after the bungalows. A beautiful tranquil walk through beautiful rice terraces. Having done a number of walks around Ubud this is for me the top for an experience of being in the rice fields away from the hustle and bustle of Ubud. Highly recommended. My advice is to walk to the end and return the same way as the road walk back is pretty uninspiring. Enjoy."

We normally start in Jl Kajeng which is a delightful small road leading north from the busy Jl Raya. This road is a delightful start to the walk. Unfortunately however the township is moving further and further up the path as more and more tourist venues are being opened and rate encroaching on the rice fields.\u00a0Sadly some of these have been designed in a manner which is most unsympathetic to the rural setting that they are capitalising on and have created a few eye sores. Once you leave these behind the walk is peaceful and pretty enough but not what it once was. I recommend that you take this walk in the early morning before it gets too hot and there are too many others walking the track. Breakfast at the Sari Organic cafe on the return walk (after crossing the irrigation channel) is a nice reward for your efforts."

You can see farmers tending to the fields and along the way there'll be places to buy coconuts or bananas from locals. We didn't just follow Kajeng road and kept following the path which makes a greater loop and takes you onto some thin dirt paths but once further in the views are even nicer and tourists more few and far between. We started on the Kajeng Junction closest to Ubud Palace and eventually turned the loop that crossed a small bridge when we saw a large remote abandoned concrete multi-storey building now occupied by locals but even then we saw a couple keep walking further in. We stopped for a massage at a small spa near the end with open rooms facing paddy fields during sunset which was amazing! Bring a torch in case you are still walking in the dark (Like us after the massages). The path is good but it's also good to make yourself more visible as there are many scooters going both ways so need to keep your ears open! Also say hi to all the people you pass, they were friendly and always acknowledged us with a smile and hello/nod (even the elderly man bathing in the irrigation water!)"

Emerald green rice paddies surround you in every direction. A few sophisticated and rustic restaurants / places to stay are scattered among the rice field with vast spaces in between them. The walk takes you through a jungle and back into open rice paddies. Leisurely about a two hours walk though beautiful Bali nature. Go north on the path at one point and you can visit an organic vanilla farm that sells fresh vanilla beans. All in all a wonderful easy stroll."

The best alternative is to start not from Kajeng, instead look or ask for a small path next to Museum Puri Lukisan on main street. Use OSMand App for offline maps and download Indonesia map. The trail is in there. This alternative will meet the Kajeng track after 1km or so. Why choosing this route? Simply because it is more beautiful and more natural. Because of the narrow path at the start in Ubud no bikes are disturbing you on this route. For the same reason, there is no construction work on this part. Best rice field views close to Ubud! If you continue to the end, you pass one of th gorges and climb up to track leading back to Ubud via Sari Organic. Nice part at first. But the closer you cone to Ubud the more the buildings dominate the rice fields as an 'ugly architectural symphony'..."
