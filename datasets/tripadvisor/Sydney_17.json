On my way back to Sydney's downtown I noticed that there were a couple of streets in The Rocks area that were lined with little vendor tents, so I decided to decend to the area and check things out. Wow! Glad I did. There were all sorts of local vendors set up and they had a ton of unique products they were selling. I bought a beautiful hand made leather wallet for a very good price. Totally unique and seems that it will last me for a long time to come. Be sure to check it out if you are in town on a Sunday. Even if you aren't, be sure to meander through the streets a The Rocks and check out the little shops scattered about."

Once there you will find cafes, restaurants and plenty of places to explore. There are organised walks that cater for different groups. A must is the museum that opened in about 2006. The best part about the Rocks is you can walk anywhere."

The Rocks markets are on every weekend with a wide variety of art and craft and food. Walking distance from Circular Quay. Be aware that as its a tourist attraction, the prices can reflect that. Some parts of the area has steep sections and stairs, so can be problematic with elderly or disabled. (We had a 90 year old in our group who used a walking frame, so some sections she couldn't negotiate)"

We loved wandering around the Rocks on both our visits to Sydney, again it is one of those unique areas that has the mix of local history of early like in the city, which today is coupled with the modern vibe that so characterises this modern city. Lots of little alleyways and side streets, which hide numerous surprises for you.There are numerous very good restaurants and cafes, shops and museums to visit and plenty to see. Also do not miss the excellent market at the weekend.From here you can wander over the Harbour Bridge, get ferry from Circular Quay and have tremendous views of the Opera House. If you miss the Rocks, you have not been to Sydney."

Sure, it's touristy and there are places which cater basically to them, but wander the back streets and alleyways and you're bound to find somewhere to get your attention. We've found some good restaurants, an interesting building or two, and some really good cafes such as La Renaissance. When they had markets last time I was there, I picked up some cool fossils and sweets, and could have bought more."

I love the architecture of houses and shops along the Rocks which is distinctively different from the rest of Sydney which reflects this dynamic city's early settlement. While it may not have the old world feel, it is quite a nice walk. I like how some parts of the pavement at the Rocks are not even and you can almost imagine people in big dresses and Edwadian shoes with hard soles walking on them. This area was considered a slum in the early days but now it is one of the most desired addresses in Sydney. I went during the weekend and I really enjoyed the Rocks Market with stalls selling very nice and interesting things. There was one stall selling jewellery made from vintage watch pieces. This is very unique. Tho I couldn't afford it, I think it is something worth buying. And there are small cafes all along the streets serving fresh pastry and coffee. After a long cold walk, it was really nice to pop into one to savour a cuppa and lamingtons. Spent half a day here before making my way to the Sydney Harbour bridge to watch the Sunset."

This was one of the highlights of my trip. The area is filled with lovely shops and not just the touristy kind. There are many art galleries and artisan craft shops. I bought lovely woolens , Aboriginal art, handmadeSilver jewelry , Australian opals and even a boomerang. I was able to do all of my shopping in one place. After all that shopping I was able to rest and relax at any number of local pubs. The nice things about the Rocks is that it is not far away from most attractions. I only had 3 days in Sydney so this turned out to be a very convenient stop for me . Don't miss out on this vibrant area. "

We found a small store selling opal jewelry at reasonable price points (pendants at $38, $49, $88) and also loose opals. Australian Arts & Gems Gallery @ Nurses Walk. Also went to Lower Fort St, and then to an unnamed walk that goes around the back of the buildings there. From there can see traffic circle of Harrington and Pottinger and the \"Still life Car\" (see Google Maps photo). The houses in this area reflect the character of buildings of the time period."

The weekend market, whilst clearly for the tourists, is still a great way to spend a couple of hours.

Sailors from the ships patronised the (now) old hotels. And where the first Sydney hospital was situated., and the nurses lived (Nurses walk). The prime place to reside was back on the hill where the Sydney Museum now is. Perhaps it would be a good idea to get a guide if you are a visitor to Sydney.....see the cobbled streets, Garrison Church where the convicts were taken, and much more. Argyle cut where the \"hanging tree\" was. Rock cuttings with old dwellings still visible.Many historic buildings....John Cadman's cottage, the water used to come up to this, where he would repair the boats. Old banks and old Police Building. Beautiful old shop fronts (if you like this kind of thing) now selling modern goods. Tank Stream can be seen at low tide exiting at the western end of Circular Quay wharves.

You can go there as a good place to shop. Yes, it is very touristy, but you can find decent prices on all sorts of Australian bits and pieces (e.g. Ugg boots, clothes, Ozzie-style hats, memorabilia, etc.). Also the markets on Sunday have some great niche Australian products. If you go with a local who knows a bit of history you can also learn a lot about Sydney's colonial past. Full of history."

Reaching there at 10am, the street market was in full flow and with a massive cruise ship docked on Circular Quay, it was busy but nevertheless we were able to take in the atmosphere. I guess the USP of The Rocks is the market stalls and these do sell a great variety of items, principally aimed at the tourist market. I confess that we provided them with some business, but for me it's the architecture and history of the place that has real meaning and the reason why it's worth taking the time to visit. There are lots of plaques and information boards that explain the history and social and political significance of The Rocks. I found these fascinating and I began to understand why the area is so important to Sydney. You can't move for places to eat and drink, both stalls and permanent shops, and I'm sure that everyone will be able to find something to their taste. Given it's historical significance a visit to the Rocks should be on every visitor's 'must do' list."

Weekend market selling mainly hand crafted goods & Friday food market. Remember the area was mainly hand cut out of the steep cliffs by the earliest white inhabitants, many convicts. Lots of cafes & restaurants though I'd advise sterling clear of the very touristy ones on the main streets. A very good Tourist Information Centre provides lots of information on all Sydney has to offer & can book tours too."

The female tour guide was friendly and very informative, it was an absolute pleasure to be part of the small tour group for almost two hours. The tour was booked through the Company which is situated at The Rocks Tower Shopping Arcade. The Rocks area has always been one of my favourite places to visit for the architecture, history, restaurants, market and fabulous harbour views, but to have the experience of walking down back lanes steeped in history and to view actual living conditions from a bygone era, was unbelievable. The stories and history information the tour guide imparted to us was invaluable. Comfortable walking shoes are a must as the walk involved step climbing and lengthy periods of standing, listening and looking. On your next visit to The Rocks, go for a look at the historical building remains behind the main street shops - you will be surprised! Two hours of educational exercise very much enjoyed. Chris C.

It is Sydney's oldest area, full of well restored and maintained terras cottages and other, historical buildings. We enjoyed the pleasant ambiance of the place, the inviting pubs and eateries along the way, the bustling market (mainly souveniers) and the many photo opportunities.Great photos - amongst others - can be taken of the Harbour Bridge, from underneath and of one of the gigantic cruise ships, if one is there. Fair warning: check menu and prices before land yourself in one of the waterside restaurants, as they can be unreasonably expensive. The Rocks is not Sydney's \"bargain basement\", prices for everything are a bit above the avarage and this can be regarded as normal as this is a typical tourist place. The low exchange rate for the Aussie dollar probably supports the higher prices.However, we have found that the Rocks is a very pleasant and safe place, we never heard of muggings, pickpockets or any other criminal activities which sadly are the characteristic dangers of many other overseas tourist destinations.We will visit it soon."

I start at Circular Quay because I arrive by train. After buying a coffee at one of the two restaurants next to the railway station I set off towards the Museum of Contemporary Art where I turn left onto Argyle St aiming for the Observatory at Observatory Hill. On my right is the Garrison Church, its open, pop in. I am now well into old Sydneys The Rocks. Moving on I climb the steps opposite the Garrison Church and walk round to the Observatory set in a lovely little park. Views are superb especially from the elevated bandstand. I can see the Harbour Bridge up close. To my left is the Parramatta River and Darling Harbour. I often sit on the grass and take in the view. If I'm lucky a tall ship like the James Craig may go past. Call into the Observatory, it may be open.Leaving the Observatory I can lose myself in the wonderful old streets of The Rocks as I make my way down to the bridge pylon then follow the foreshore back to Circular Quay via the International Terminal or simply retrace my steps depending on how energetic I feel. Quaint, heggledy piggledy, charming, historic, vibrant, heritage, friendly all describes Old Sydney. It wasn't planned, it simply grew. Cul de sacs, side streets, secret passageways, old stairways, take a camera of some sort.Time to move on, refreshments are available in the Rocks or at Circular Quay as you pass by on the way to the Opera House.On arrival at the Opera House walk around and explore, it has super views and the ferries come in real close. You can get refreshments there too, there are so many places to eat.Just past the Opera house is the entrance to the botanical gardens, a great place to sit and rest on the grass, plenty of shade under some of the Fig huge trees. Not another restaurant / cafe for refreshments. You won't go hungry. This is a walk where you may put on weight.You have been following the shoreline so it is impossible to get lost. The gardens are a great place to visit with its fine sculptures and plant selections from around the world.Time to go, next stop is Lady Macquarie's Chair on the point. Have you managed to get this far? The whole walk is only a few kilometers but it is worth the trouble.From Lady M's chair you have fine views back to the opera House and Harbour.Bridge. On the way back I stop at Circular Quay for some typical Australian Fish n Chips, sit on a bench and watch the smorgasbord of faces go past. The hustle and bustle of Circular Quay is a delight, it's a great spot to sit and watch our unique and charming ferries as they speedily arrive and depart. As an immigrant to Australia forty years ago this place grabbed me and still does. To me this is Sydney."

We loved this area, so much to see and do. Buskers were busy playing and singing down beside the harbour. We went on a walking tour at night to see and hear the history of this area. The tour was informative and free!! You gave a donation if you want too! We had a great volunteer taking our tour!"

There are some fabulous artworks on show, and I did end up buying a Charles Billich in his gallery near the Contemporary Art Museum - although I didn't buy it until I had returned home! The lady there was very helpful without being pushy and (luckily) the piece was still available when I decided I could afford it after all! There are some lovely places to eat and have a coffee, too, and were reasonably priced.Finally, there are some great views from the top of the Art Museum, which is also well worth a visit!"

The whole area buzzes with colour, energy, music and a sense of excitement. I never leave the Rocks Markets without a treasure clutched in my hands. The Rocks is situated across the road from the Cruise Terminal and easily accessible by foot or public transport. Just take the bus or train to Circular Quay, cross the little park, up the steps and you are back in history, to the place where Sydney Town began, three hundred years ago! The historical buildings are well sign posted, and are used as shops, museums, restaurants and art galleries....the past blending seamlessly with the present. I recommend a visit to the Rocks for all age groups. There is a bustling Bavarian Bierhaus for those wanting to try something different. Enjoy!"

My GF even walked to the Sydney Opera House for an evening ballet without issues!Besides location, you can easily find transportation options from ferries (nearby at circular quay), to train, to taxis. Only challenge about the Rocks is many establishments close down early. It may be the time of year I went to Sydney but bars, restaurants, and shops closed way earlier than I'm used to living in the 24 hour a day Philippines. Be aware of thatFinally, I'm a cautious traveler and thoughtful about my surroundings but I always felt safe and had no issues in the Rocks or anywhere in Australia.

George Street will take you up under the Sydney Harbor Bridge, but when you get to the Holiday Inn, you have seen most of it. Also look into the side streets especially Argyle Street for good Italian and German restaurants. There is also a weekend market here. The back of The Museum Of Contemporary Art also borders The Rocks. You will love the wonderful architecture especially the old hotels, reminiscent of old times. We ate here 3 times during our weeklong stay because of the great selection of eating places, and good ones too as all were busy. Recommended, Pancakes on the Rocks, Munich Brauhaus, La Renaissance."

It's a very interesting section of Sydney- right next to Circular Quay and the hills overlooking the harbor.In the Rocks area, I recommend climbing up to The Australian Hotel. \"Climbing up\" means just this- lots and lots of steps as the area is very hilly. If you have a problem with walking, there is always a taxi. At the Australian Hotel you will experience an authentic original bar with unusual (for us Americans) authentic Australian food. We had a delicious duck pizza, but weren't brave enough to try the kangaroo or wallabe pizza! Took a picture of the menu as it was so unusual! You will find lots of locals here, many of whom are college kids. Hey, Sydney is full of youth- a happening, young hip atmosphere. Hotel hopping in the Rocks area: Next, in the evening, be sure to go to The Glenmore Hotel on Cumberland Street. Have a drink at their bar and enjoy fantastic views of the city. Shoppers Delight: On the weekends there is a craft market with REAL ART- the \"good Stuff\"- items made by Australian artists!. This is NOT a flea market with junk- worth going to-located on the main streets. Just walk past the Quay area and you will see white awnings. Also there is a center large tented area with a variety of vendors. In particular, I found a vendor who had unusual wooden face watches with leather bands. Also, lots of beautiful handcrafted \"high-end\" jewelry in a wide range of prices. You will also find some fun and delicious food there- from handmade chocolates to grilled and buttered corn on the cob! Loved Sydney-Loved the Rocks!"

As we walked along the terminals for the various ferries we continued toward the older section near the harbor. We walked up a few steps and came upon the main thoroughfare for vehicular traffic. Shops and restaurants lined both side of the street in this quaint area known as \"The Rocks\".There are many secondary and side paths where we came upon those special and unique places. On the weekend they also hold an open market which attracts many vendors and local artist.Here my wife discovered her favorite cafe for cappuccino and a pastry. We also found a great side street cafe for lunch nearby as well. In one of these stores, my wife bought me my Aussie Squashy hat for my birthday. There are a tons of stores in Sydney that sell them but this was special coming from a store in one of our favorite places to spend time while in Sydney. We will be staying in a hotel in this area on our next visit to Sydney. You must spend at least a day checking out \"The Rocks\" if you are visit the Sydney area."

For history bluffs there is Codmans Cottage, Sydney Observatory and Dawes Point Battery. The Rocks started as a slum for visiting sailors and prostitutes which was a perfect haven for the later Rock Push gang to dominate. Once the buildings started to decay and then the Bubonic plague came in, it wasn't hard to clear out the residents and start the Harbor Bridge. There were years of clashing between town folks and the Union with the town folks winning; and the area developing into what it is today."

There are a lot of old buildings as can be expected which are now either places to eat or shop. There are substantial areas for pedestrians only. It tends to be a little quiet during the working week but really shines at the weekend and public holidays. Every weekend there is a substantial market at the very end of George Street. The goods on offer are good quality not junk as found at too many markets. My favorite pub is the Glenmore 96 Cumberland St. It has a roof top bar with views forever overlooking the harbour."

We caught the train to Circular Quay and then began our walk starting at George Street and coming across the historic Russell Hotel built in 1887. The hotel was built on the site of the once Moveable hospital around 1790, also the Old Police Station, there are lots of lanes around the back of this with the Nurses walk, Surgeons Court, the site of the old bakehouse and the Suez Canal which was once an open sewer and where prostitutes and gangsters hung out. Lovely shops and cafes are now around these areas. There are also old cottages still in existence. We visited the Discovery museum which is a wealth of information of early years, wandering next through more back street areas and walked under the Harbour bridge through the cutting and came out on Lower Fort street which is steeped in history and now the properties there are worth millions. This is Millers Point. Departing from here we ended up along the old wharf areas, which are now beautiful housing properties adorned by shops cafes and businesses. From here you can continue on to Barangaroo and the whole new development. What a great day we had exploring Sydney's past. Jubeesydney."

My son who declared the markets was going to be full of womans stuff had to eat his words when he found a great wire maker making alien toys."

Great selection of bars.....international tourists beware, some are adopting a \"service\" charge when opening bar tabs.....reject this out of hand....it's NOT compulsory (barely legal here) and a blatant attempt to fleece visitors (shame on those who do, drinks prices already cater for staff penalty rates)."

This is one of Sydney's oldest and most historically significant places. Therein lies the problem, in my opinion. The Rocks has been turned into a cluster of open air markets, cafes and pubs. Nothing wrong that necessarily, but it distracts from the history of the area. I was disappointed with the crowds as that made it difficult to enjoy the historical buildings and to find the museums. Nevertheless, a visit to The Rocks is worthwhile. I'd suggest investing 2-3 hours. I would also suggest getting there early in the day to avoid the shopping rush."

We walked around and explored lots of the nooks and crannies of the area. We probably should have taken a walking tour and would have gained a better understanding. The area has a great historic feel and fun pubs and some good food. Lots of little shops but it isn't overwhlemed with shopping, it just has a really comfortble authentic feel. Some pubs, some shops, a museum, there was a historic dig going on, lots of views up at the harbor bridge. I would recommend vistors take some type and roam around there which is really easy to do because it is right there between the bridge and the opera house."

In our recent trip to Sydney, we were fortunate to have chosen to stay at The Rocks area with is well preserved buildings and historic posters and tourist experiences. The first pub in Sydney is there, the one where press gangs shoved guys down a chute to the basement and thence to waiting ships eager for new crew. We spent as much time as possible just enjoying the history of the place and trying imagine how it was back when the first fleet arrived, as well as grabbing a meal here, a beer there, that is the nature of the place. Yes, it is steep in places and the stairs can be a bit crowded however everyone was helpful and courteous even though it was Easter. Definitely come here for an afternoon and enjoy the ambience, stay a while longer if you can."

My girlfriend and I went to the markets at The Rocks on the Saturday we were in Sydney and while I won't use the expletive I used to describe how long it goes on for, needless to say, it's long. Really long. They have something for everyone and I was able to pick up a lot of souvenirs for people back home that I wouldn't get anywhere else. One of the best things I was able to get at The Rocks was a didgeridoo. There were a few buskers in the Harbour playing them and we asked where we could get an authentic didgeridoo and they told me about a store in The Rocks called the Spirit Gallery.The Rocks is yet another perk of staying in the Harbour when you're in Sydney. It may be pricier but it is definitely worth the price."

Along with shops selling Australian boots and clothing, and The Oldest Pub in Australia (a pub full of guys with beer and tv sports, not much of a surprise there) we found interesting small and creative restaurants and bars, a midday street market, better shops and good harbor views. Could be that it is different in the evening, but we found it a pleasant contrast to both the festival marketplace that is Circular Quay and the highrise offices and hotels of the adjacent Central Business District. Definitely worth a look around and another unique side of Sydney which is a very livable city."

Our tour guide for the walking tour was very knowledgable and gave an excellent commentary on the Rocks area - both historical and current day significance. The group was about 9 people so that made for a more personable guided tour that enabled opportunities to ask questions. The walking tour was quite manageable. I was concerned that it might be a bit difficult but the tour guide made sure we went at a comfortable pace so the was greatly appreciated. I would recommend this tour."

But do notice that shops close at 4 or 5 PM except on Thursday...the taxi driver said it was due to double wage and some opt for not being open.Another good place for drinks is the rooftop of the Glenmore Hotel....you just a bit up the hill and there is the entrance for the bridge attraction...the climb.Best,"

Probably takes a couple of hours, but ends near lots of action near the harbor (pubs, restaurants, the opera house, etc.) so you've plenty to do when the tour's over. Our tour guide was Josh and he was very interesting, well-informed (a history major), and entertaining. I highly recommend the free walking tours."

There is some great history in The Rocks you just need to look for the plaques that provide it. The rest is made up of a few stores, galleries etc., that are good to wonder round. It really is a touristy destination. We did eat at the oldest pub in Sydney - Fortune of War - which was great. See my review on the pub. You don't need more than a couple of hours to have covered all of The Rocks."

The alleys and laneways are what I enjoy the most rather than the boutique shopping. There are many ways to explore these:1. Take Globe Street off George Street and climb the steps at the end to Harrington Street. Cross the road and climb the steps opposite at #85 and turn right at the top to Susannah Place or continue up the next flight to the Big Dig.2. Susannah Place - continue exploring along here (Cambridge Street) past the Susannah Place Museum (or stop here as well) to Argyle Street, cross the road and climb Argyle Stairs follow the laneway (Gloucester Walk) along past the back of the Glenmore Hotel - great open air bar up the top) to the end which takes you to George Street. Here you are under the Harbour Bridge. Cross the road and continue to explore down to the harbour.These are just a couple of the walks that you can take but as the Rocks is quite a small area you won't likely get very lost so just wander and you'll find some very interesting sights."

Further along George St, almost under the foot of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, you'll find the weekend craft markets, always worth a looksee at handmade local souvenirs, tea, breakfast spreads, tea towels, hand bags. Wander around the The Rocks streets - you won't get lost because the area is well signposted.Plenty of cafe and bistro style eateries to choose from, including pubs.If you have time, and the weather is good, continue your walk from the markets under the Bridge and over to Barangaroo Park."

Located next to the transport hub of Circular Quay and with gorgeous views of Sydney Harbour, it is a fantastic place for a wander, a meal, shopping or a couple of drinks at the oldest pubs in Australia (there are at least a dozen here).From the shady lawns of First Fleet Park, beside Circular Quay, where there is always music and street theatre, the Rocks is mostly uphill. We like to head to the top of the hill, while we are still fresh, and work our way down. There are lots of ways up the hill, but we like to walk to the Fortune of War hotel - the oldest in Sydney - (for an optional beverage) then through the \"Nurse's Walk\". Alternatively, walk through Playfair Street (everyone loves cobblestones). Stick to the little alleys and old sandstone stairs for a look at the oldest parts of Sydney. There are so many things to do and see. The Observatory right at the top of the hill has amazing views and is good for a tour (best at night), Suzannah Place Museum on the Cumberland Steps is a little-known museum with a really interesting look at how Sydney-siders have lived over the last hundred years or so. You can cross under the Harbour Bridge at the Argyle Cut (which convicts cut by hand) and wander through the wonderful old residential part of the Rocks on the Western side of the bridge. The Lord Nelson is a beautiful sandstone brewery/pub for a break (and also pretty much the top of the hill). From here it's all down hill. Head down Lower Fort St to the Harbour View Hotel and turn right, back into the heart of the alleys, shops and restaurants of the Rocks or continue to the bottom of the street and cross back under the Bridge and walk around the harbour-front park. From the Harbour View, you can also walk directly beneath the bridge toward the harbour and see the newly-excavated original fortifications and gun batteries. Back on the Circular Quay side, visit Cadmans Cottage, one of the original buildings in the Sydney settlement.Other things to do include the awesome Sydney Harbour Bridge climb (expensive), a cheaper option is walking across the Bridge on the footpath and climb the south Pylon (go up the bridge stairs on Cumberland Street near Gloucester Street). The Sydney Theatre Company is on Pier 4/5, the Museum of Contemporary Art is also an interesting (and argument-provoking) place to visit.On weekends there are big markets on George Street."

The history,the daily lives of survival,is only the beginning.You have the old road and paths made of cobblestone,old buildings,such a eye opener. The Irish pubs with Irish music filling the street, just makes younwant to do an Irish jig there and then.This venue is a must for any travelers, weekend markets can be found with the best day to visit is a Sunday. If you find the markets you will find the Mercantile Hotel, an Irish pub not to walk past without calling in.It has great food, nice cold Guiness on tap with excellent foot tapping Irish music."

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday the exciting Rock's Markets operate from 10 am. with many items to tempt one. Spend the day at the Rocks -- maybe going to the movies at the Dendy, a trip to Manly on the ferry operating from the terminal or catch a ferry to the fish markets. The Rocks is a hub for many activities around the Sydney Harbour basin. See the original old buildings -- Argyle Arts Centre - the first hospital in Sydney - the Museum of Contemporary Art - the Police Station and the old hotels."

We walked up around the Sydney Harbor Bridge and then down by the docks. There are many restaurants in the area, all but a few closed at this early hour.

This material gave the name to the region, which had a very bad reputation until 1870 due to the gangs, the prostitutes and the visiting sailors. Early in the 20th c. the old buildings were ready to collapse and the Government inspected 3.800 buildings and started demolishing some of them but WWI stopped this action.In 1920 more buildings were demolished for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Then in 1968 the Government decided to demolish all the old buildings of the area and create a new development. The locals resisted the decision. Finally in 1975 the buildings were renovated and the area turned to a tourist attraction. But the problem with the poverty of this part of Sydney still exists together with some street crimes.Between Circular Quay and Sydney Harbour Bridge, it's an inevitable visit by any tourist especially those who want to walk on the Harbour Bridge. A lot of old pubs, even the Sydney's oldest - Fortune of War (1828), many craft and souvenir shops, food and cloth markets, exhibition galleries, etc. fill the streets of The Rocks. Even the Museum of Contemporary Art is situated here. Entry is free.The colourful markets of the Rocks are open all the year round on Saturdays and Sundays from 10.00' to 17.00'."

The Rocks is full of cafes and little streets and lanes one can explore but on this occasion, I choose to take my friends to the MCA for a snack and drink. The view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House from the balcony in this cafe is spectacular. Where else in the world can you get a million dollar view like this for the price of a cup of coffee? I recommend all travellers visit The Rocks and all it has to offer."

Great restaurants, shoppiing, and a very short walk to the Quay (where you get the Harbor cruise ), the Sydney Opera House, the Botanical Gardens and the Harbor Bridge. We stayed at the Four Seasons and loved the hotel and the location. Could not have picked a better area to stay. Fortunate that we arrived on Australia Day and the place was hopping with rock bands, street vendors, and fireworks. Learned that it is not necessary to tip waiters unless you received exceptional service in a restaurant, as waiters are well paid, as opposed to in the US where waiters rely on tips. Also, know that at cafes, if you do take out vs. eating at the tables, coffee and food will be alot less for the same food and drink. Highly recomeend the Appertiv on George Street for great Italian food and the Fine Food Store has an awesome breakfast."

That means you're near or right on top of 'The Rocks' so it would be silly not to take the little extra stroll. 'The Rocks' is indeed a historic little patch of Sydney, but it's now pretty touristy. Touristy? Get over it, you're a tourist too, and that means it caters for you! There's a street market full of souvenirs from the predictable to the surprising, lots of cafes and bars of a decent quality (one of the most popular bars being a German beer and ham hock place, weirdly enough, but you can just walk on past it) and a few plaques and plates explaining aspects of the history. Nice little Victorian shops sell all sorts of souvenirs ranging from the really vulgar selection of things made from kangaroo scrotums through Aussie art to the undeniably Australian take-home staples of RM Williams and Drizabone. If you've just got off one of the ferries or tours, or have walked around Circular Quay after seeing the Opera House or Botanical gardens, and are flagging a little, don't stop at the far too touristy places on the back of the quay, continue on to 'The Rocks' which whilst certainly touristy is much more pleasant and has plenty of places to stop for just a cuppa or a beer or a meal, plus the added attractions of the market etc."

There are the most amazing houses owned by the council and some still have tennants in.

Go up to the 3rd floor and just have a beer and look at the view of the Opera House and Circular Quay. Truly amazing. The market on a weekend does the most amazing food so make sure you take the whole family down here for this as there are so many different cultures to choose from.

Take a boat trip or sit in the grassy areas and watch the ibis - they are so tame. Watch the cruise ships and dream!"

It's so picturesque and has been sensitively restored. The narrow, block paved, areas/streets make you feel as though you are back to a time when there were cobbles under foot, and horses and carts, were the only transport. There is so much to see. We loved this area. There are, as always, plenty of restaurants, cafes, and bars. Quaint shops selling souvenirs and all so close to the harbour yet looking a lifetime away. It's well kept, fascinating to walk around and see all there is. Sightseeing at it's best. The oldest pub in Sydney, 'Fortune Of War' is there too! Why not visit and pay a visit to The Russell hotel too, just a few doors away?"

It was just a great area of Sydney in between Sydney Harbor and Darling Harbor. Because the Circular Quay is right there, the Rocks is the perfect place to stay to see many parts of Sydney. We very much enjoyed just walking around in the Rocks and seeing the sights. I do have to make one complaint. I don't know what idiot decided to let cruise ships block the view of Sydney Harbor for anyone staying in the Rocks, but whoever made that decision should be eternally embarrassed for such a dumb mistake. The cruise ships could easily have been put in at some other harbor, and the Sydney Harbor would have been there for all to enjoy. As it is, the cruise ships come in, everyone gets off their cruise ship and tours Sydney, and the ships block the view of everyone in the Rocks, while there's no one actually on the cruise ship during the day! It's an amazingly dumb use of a beautiful space. But don't let that disuade you. Stay in the Rocks and visit the Rocks, you'll love it!"

We've been a few times before, but the place is always worth seeing when the market is up and running. The stalls themselves vary on a weekly basis by it was great to see I few I recognised from my last visit a few months earlier. All tastes are catered for, from bespoke jewellery, to woodwork, to clothes and t-shirts, trinkets, silverware - you name it, there's something there. It gets very busy so it's worth getting there early and taking your time - sometimes the flow of pedestrian traffic is so great that it becomes almost impossible to stop at a stall, and you end up looping back on yourself to see it again. The highlight for me this time was watching a chap painting alien landscapes using enamel sprays and a variety of ad-hoc stencils - spray tins, newspaper, bits of card. The pictures were created in about fifteen minutes flat and were frankly brilliant. Not my kind of art in general, but superb to watch him putting them together. And if you can find the Chilli Factory stall, go and challenge your taste buds there - the fiery frillneck hiss is worth sampling. There was also a stall selling home-made men's t-shirts with some very complex looking geometrical patterns on them. Kicking myself that I didn't get one. If you don't like this place, it's hard to imagine you ever being happy. Ever!"

I have never found a better place to get a fix on Sydney's historic convict days, then this jumble of cobblestone streets and cul-de-sacs just minutes from Circular Quay. Stepping off the harbour foreshore we find sandstone terraces and cottages and some of Sydney's oldest pubs. This area is filled with museums & galleries, lively markets and hotels boasting the best iconic views over the Bridge and Opera House. The past and the present collide in the best possible way. steep, higgledy-piggledy streets and lane-ways sprawl out within sight of gorgeous harbour and its busy aquatic traffic. We took a guided tour to learn more about the early history which brought to life sailors, soldiers and stevedores creating this array of terraces, storehouses and workmens' cottages.Prowling or loitering this is the precinct for hand-crafted jewellery, gourmet bush tucker (condiments) and glorious patisseries, cafes and lovely pubs, most with live music.. Gently amble up and down the streets and visit the Museum of Contemporary Art , Sydney Theatre Company, the Justice and Police Museum, across the road from the Sydney Museum which lead to the sweeping Botanic Gardens, Lady Macquarie's Chair, alongside the iconic \"Sails\" of the Opera House and the fantastic Sydney's Art gallery.... around the block from St, mary's Cathedral, Expansive Hyde Park and the city.... not far from Cockle Bay and more harbour wonderland.Why try to see everything in one day?"

For example if you walk over the Sydney Harbour Bridge from Milsons Point railway station you will end up walking down the bridge to the Rocks. Or if you are visiting the Circular Quay again you will find the Rocks as well. It is a very interesting district with lots of historic colonial buildings, mixed with street side restaurants, souvenirs and gift shops, a craft market on weekends, plus a Ken Done gallery. It has a bit of everything and it's very laid back. The local advice is to venture all the side streets apart from the main ones."

The buildings have quite a story to tell about early Australian history. The Argyle Rocks Dig is fascinating, the story of George Cribb an early convict is also well supported by the Rocks Museum. Remains of the old Battery under the Bridge and Suzanah Place Museum also very interesting telling a story of a new colony and the people who made it successful.

An internet search will provide you with maps, directions and a list of must-sees to help you re-live the past. Cadman's Cottage & it's history sets the scene so maybe go there first followed by a visit to the information centre on George St. Take time to wander around the laneways & back streets to get a feel for the area & maybe fit in a visit to the Observatory too. The Rocks markets operate on the weekends & have wonderful boutique stalls selling jewellery, hand-made clothing items, wooden toys, great fudge & many other yummy food items.

Quite likely a ship will be in the harbor so it's a busy spot.

Some of our favourite places are there, such as Le Rennaissance cafe, the MCA, The Rocks Museum which gives an idea of life in the days when Sydney began as a penal colony and with free settlers. There are plenty of shops, although they are mostly for tourists, on the weekends there's the markets, also a bit too touristy, but there are some good things on offer. Most of all, it's close to Circular Quay and the ferries. Go by train, ferry or bus, parking is a nightmare and terribly expensive if you can find a spot."

Jewelry, leather products, home wall decorations, candles, soaps ... all sorts of really unique designs that conveys the character of Sydney and the creative Aussie outlook.We spent 3 hours there and didn't do all the shops justice. Wish we had more time there. The rest of the Rocks was also a nice stroll and allows very nice views of the Sydney Opera house and the Sydney Bridge. There is a pleasant atmosphere of creativity and liveliness that I think also encapsulates the fabulous city."

The area is towered over by the Harbour Bridge at the top and Circular Quay and the Harbour in front. You can walk to the Powerhouse museum, around the Harbour to the Opera House and the gardens, catch a ferry or explore the shops and hotels and eat houses that are everywhere in the area. The market starts on Friday night and runs thru to Sunday with even more on offer. We walked around the area and into the main body of Sydney. Caught ferries and the hop on hop off bus. We walked upto the Old Observatory, had drinks on our balcony and watched life passing by and indulged in a range of food on offer from street stalls to Rockpool and Quay Restaurants. We maxed out every day and night and still left with more to see and do. Will be back to continue the fun. The tourist station can provide a list of many of the things to try, and if you just get out and walk around you will find a million things to do and how close everything is. Yes some of the area is steep but there are staircases and walk ways everywhere. The area is very safe and fun to get around in.

There were Crocodile Dundee Hats, wine bottle holders , lizards and hundred of t-shirts for sale. We went in one shop that was an exclusive opal dealer. I purchased my opals in Australia from 1972 to 1975. We walked around the harbour to the nearby Circular Quay. It was a very relaxing half day. There was also an open food market where you could eat a very nice meal."

Close to circular Quay for ferries as well as close to the Sydney rail network it is well positioned. The Street that the Rocks is in (George St) is currently undergoing major works so using public transport would be wise. From this area you can walk to Sydney harbour bridge, and the Sydney observatory both well worthy of a visit. Indeed from the Sydney observatory ( high up on a hill) you will get a magnificent view of the surrounding area including the bridge. Nice area for a half day stroll and meal. Most produce in this area is made in China and very over prices. You can walk to this area from anywhere in the city, if you require a reference point whilst checking a map use the Sydney harbour bridge."

Many delicate artworks, accessories etc there. Prices are generally high though. Make sure you check their opening days before you confirm your journey if you are a market-lover. The museums there are interesting to visit as well. They tell you the history beyond the city we see today."

While the Rocks retains its charm having had an association with the area for over 40 years I find the loss of the original shops e.g. the Shell Shop with tourist tack disappointing. Naturall with the international terminal immediately adjacent to the start of the rocks at the Quay there will be enterprise directed towards collecting the tourist $ so my advice is to keep away for the themed pubs and move a little further afield to the western side of the headland for a good pub experience. Having said that the waterfront group of restaurants offer reasonably priced (for the location) meals and stunning views of the quay and the opra house. The Rocks were of course at the forefront of the Green Bans in Sydney in the 1970s - it will be interesting to see how matters develop with the NSW Govt pulling out of the home market in the Rocks/Millers Point area - hopefully much of the character can be retained even if sadly many of the residents will not remain."

The food is very good at all of the restaurants I took my Mum to, for Mothers Day but I would not normally eat there due to price especially with the family and or on a budget. Not a place to take the kids to on New Years eve as it is so packed with people, many of whom have had to much to drink. Other side of the Harbor is far better.The old Pubs etc are nice but nowhere as interesting or full of character as those of Europe and Britain etc.Actually some of them are um um ....not so goodBasically the Rocks is just a nice place to walk around, take some great bridge photos and enjoy the harbor view"

The whole area was farm land back in the 1800s. We discovered it when we were walking to go up on the harbour bridge."

Around every corner is a surprise - and a delight. As one who has visited and stayed in The Rocks on numerous occasions, I'm still discovering new delights that illuminate Sydney's rugged and simple origins.Go there! It's a no-brainer. You'll be enchanted. And as a bonus, you'll marvel at the up-close-and-personal view of the Sydney bridge - from directly below the iconic structure.

It is well located, close to Circular Quay so after a visit there, you can hang out with for some nice views of the Opera House. You can shop at a special market on weekends or at luxury brands store or at other outlets. If you are looking for a massive Apple Store or department store, pass your way, The Rocks is about intimacy and authenticity. Yu will find different type of food from all other the world: pub, Asian, Italian(served with the charm and accent from Italy!) and so many others. Charm, the Rocks have a lot because the architecture is very colonial Australian with old bricks and it avoids straight long and straight streets. It does not stop here as you can have the views from the Shangri-La rooftop bar with excellent mojitos btw, to the view upwards the Harbour Bridge. If you come back to Circular Quay by George Street, stop at the art gallery; some works are simply stunning. And if you do not eat at the Rocks, come back for some interesting bar experience, either in a church or in a kind of very modern, well I was not sure what it was apart from awesome !!"

I'll still visit it whenever I visit Sydney but only in the hope to find the one or two stalls that' are worth returning for. It's the biggest weekend market in Sydney and should still be on anyone's bucket list if u don't go to Sydney often. I'll recommend visiting the other markets like eveleigh and Alexandra."

After arriving at Circular Quay one of the first things we did was walk through The Rocks, an old historical district with dozens of buildings that were once part of the original settlement. Today, many of those buildings have been converted into apartments, shops, and restaurants bringing life to this historic area. We did our tour backwards, beginning at the Sydney Observatory and then walking down and under the Sydney Harbor Bridge back to Circular Quay. I didn't feel we missed anything doing it backwards, the stone streets, and narrow alleys between the brick buildings are fantastic no matter which route you take."

We also stopped at a small little nice coffee shop where we paid AUD$40 for 2 coffees and 2 pieces of pastry.

Didn't do that, simply walk on the bridge and see the view."

It was a blast seeing Sydney harbor on the reconstruction of the original 1787 Royal Navy sailing ship. I even got to put on the captains hat and steer the ship through the harbor. That ship has since sunk in a storm a few years ago but it sure was a blast to have been on it. After that we went to a great restaurant and had a great pancake brunch. We then climbed the tower of the Syndey bridge and had one of the best views in the area or the Harbor and the opera house. It was a very memorable part of our visit to Australia."

Pedestrian-friendly and filled with cafes and boutique shops. There are also a number of walking tours that you can take although we did not opt for these. Sydney Bridge tours are operated from here. On the weekends there are a couple of different markets - a \"foodie\" market on Friday and a food, artisinal goods market on Saturday and Sunday. As it is a very touristy area you won't find a cheap meal here, or a cheap beer. As mentioned in other reviews, however, we found Sydney to be a rather expensive food city overall. The locals seem to agree. I would recommend visiting the Sydney Visitor's Centre at the Rocks. Tons of info and all for free. We tried to make a donation as we were quite impressed but it is all funded through the government and they don't even accept donations. Worth a look."

            "review": "An important part of Australia's history.. First a quick history lesson. \"The Rocks\" is probably the oldest residential area in Australia. It's called the rocks because it is actually built on a sandstone rock ledge on the west side of Sydney Cove (now called Circular Quay). Like most cities Sydney grew organically from its original setup. The rocks provided good views, the Tank Stream, the only fresh water source, fed into the cove and was easily accessible and it separated the government \"military\" functions from the public (though they were originally mostly convicts). One of the oldest buildings \"Cadman's Cottage\" is wedged between the Rocks and the Quay near the Overseas Ship terminal. It's typical of the early construction, built in the first thirty years of settlement, and it was actually on the beach front, giving an indication of the change in topography over two hundred years. There are many other old buildings around the area and \"The Rocks\" precinct preserves much of the architectural evolution and history of white man's colonisation of an ancient land. The credit that it is preserved goes to the Builders' labourers Federation (an Australian workers union, since disbanded) and in particular to a man called Jack Mundey who instituted a system of workers strikes called \"Green Bans\" to stop the government of the day approving demolition and reconstruction and selling off much of the heritage buildings to developers to build high rise buildings (similar to whats happening at Barangaroo, just over the hill, as I write. But that;s another story). Had the Green Bans not worked, much of what can be enjoyed today would be gone. Today the Rocks is overshadowed by a great Sydney icon the magnificent Harbour Bridge. Nonetheless it is a very pleasant place to while away a few hours with interesting craft and specialty shops, some delightful Irish Pubs, brilliant cafes and on weekends \"Craft Markets\". A walk through \"Argyle cut\" in Argyle Street leads to Observatory Hill , the quaint Garrison Church and other historically significant residential buildings. On the Quay side are some of the original store houses, now converted into restaurants abutting the wharf, which make for perfect strolling conditions on a nice spring day. It's probably the best place in Australia to imagine what it was like in the \"early days of settlement\" and compare the \"improvements\" we have wrought since. But most of all it is a place to relax and stroll. Enjoy and savour the atmosphere, soak up the history, buy a unique bargain and enjoy a beer or a Guinness, eat a humble meat pie, a banquet or something in between, the choice is yours."

Lunch was a roast pork roll with ''crackling\" from Phillip's Foote - it was so good that our original plan to just share a single sandwich went out the window. And the lemon sorbet from Giorgi's Gelato was refreshing and had just the right balance of sweet & tang. Wish we'd had room to try more items - the line for the Turkish Gozleme wound down an entire alley so it must be good, and everything else looked worth a try as well. We also enjoyed the live music by Lawrence Gratton who was set up in the public seating area. If you can't make it on a Friday, there are regular weekend markets on both Saturday and Sunday. Walking among the historic buildings on the cobblestone streets & alleys is a grand trip back in time.

The information center had quite a few brochures and a great shop for Australian mugs, books, shopping bags and other items. There is a foodie market on Friday but we were a bit disappointed in that we expected more options. The Turkish stall had a very long line. The Contemporary Art Museum is located here as well as the Rocks Museum. Both of the museums were free when we went. The Rocks Museum talked about the early settlers in the Rocks area which was quite interesting. There is a wide variety of great shops and restaurants in the area. It is just adjacent to the Circular Quay, which is a transportation hub for trains, buses and in particular ferries. There is truly something for everyone."

The Rocks is steeped in history and wandering around the wonderful areas reading all about the convicts and early settlers is fascinating. It is also close to Sydney Harbour. I would highly recommend this area to tourists and locals alike who enjoy walking through historic areas. Lots of fabulous market stalls with locally made products as well as yummy street food."

Wait till you see the beer engines. The Sydney Opera house is across the road and across the bay. Tour boats operate nearby. And don't forget, up the hioll on the side streets are the hidden gem bars. Little wonders."

(That is if you discount the Aboriginals). Therefore is probably the oldest inhabited area in the city. Like old towns the world over the tourist industry sees a good earner. That being the case it has it's fair share of tourist tat outlets and a few reasonable quality restaurants. From here can be seen a fine view of the harbour and the world famous gig that goes by the name of \"Sydney Opera House\" A most remarkable example of imaginative architecture.All in all a good few hours can be frittered away here enjoying the sites or enjoying lunch. Oh yes if you like opals there are more than a few dealers in this lovely stone ready to take your money.This revue if based upon several visits over a 20 year time period."

Here you will find old warehouses, now converted into smart restaurants or indoor markets and malls. The Rocks has it all and is a magnet for overseas tourists. Here you will mingle with people from all over the world, in the shadow of the iconic Harbour Bridge. On the weekends there are the Rocks Markets, which are great fun and where you might find that special treasure to take home. Located adjacent to the Circular Quay area and looking across the Quay to the Sydney Opera House, this is a good vantage point to begin a walking tour of Sydney City. Accessible by bus, train and car, you wont have trouble getting there. It is not advisable to take your car because city parking is a scarce commodity and paid parking is prohibitive. If you are in a nearby hotel, just walking is best."

Enjoy shopping for bargains in many arcades full of wonderful galleries or just chill in any courtyard over a pint.

Hidden steps, paths and alleyways are coupled with wrought-iron handrails. If you appreciate colonial buildings and details then spend a few hours wandering around the area.

Close to interstate buses and trains to airport or other Sydney stations. This is the spot for wonderful views of harbour, opera house or bridge. Boat cruises around harbour leave from here as do ferries. Great coffee shops and restaurants for lunch and many choices for dinner. Both cheap and expensive choices. We were at the Rocks for Vivid so there were crowds at night which was fun. If you are looking for tourist merchandise this is the spot. We visited an excellent gallery with a huge range of affordable artisan created pieces. It is an older part of Sydney which has been kept and put to modern tourist use. We stayed in a boutique hotel in an old building. Was fabulous. At dusk we had a wine in front of the Opera House and looked at climbers on the Harbour Bridge. We walked up to Martin Place to have a coffee at the now famous Lindt Cafe. Was an easy 10 minute walk from the Rocks. There is a wonderful modern art gallery situated at The Rocks. This would be the very first spot I would head to as a tourist visiting Sydney."

In the 1970s all The Rocks area was to be bulldozed and replaced with ugly office towers. The Builders Labourers Federation (BLF), a construction union led by Jack Mundey, came to the rescue to save the area by imposing the world's first 'green bans', prohibiting the destruction. Today the area is known all around the world as a great record of the early Australian settlement in Port Jackson (Sydney). It is a lovely place to walk through, enjoy markets, admire sandstone structures, enjoy Sydney Harbour, and eat delicious food."

The restaurants/bars are spilling out into the street and there is a throng that the places looses when the crowds go home. While you are there don't forget to look up and look around the restored buildings and stop and read the plaques and learn a bit about the history of the area and its occupants."

Walk across the bridge + exhibition ( or bridge walk) eat at the Australian and take the ferry back to Darling Harbour after people watching at the opera house. A great date enretainment!"

The remaining cottages have a charm of their own nestling, and almost dominated by the modern towers.Hundreds of these old houses have already been demolished, and should these remaining streets with their trendy bars, restaurants and markets, go the same way, Sydney's character will be much the poorer.Shady laneways lead the eye to harbour views with the ever-present dominance of the Harbour Bridge and contrast of the Opera House as well as Sydney's ferries busily coming and going; the Rocks are an absolute must visit and should be placed on top of every visitor's list."

There was also a cruise ship docked so on that day there were many americans spending up large. The market had street show, music and Sydney put on its best weather. Houses were converted into shops where you can dine in the backyard gardens or upstairs looking down at the busy markets. My next visit will be to the german restaurant and then the french shop.

Yes i know that there is 40,000 years of aboriginal history but in terms of european settlement we are a young country. The Rocks is where the first fleet settlers clung to the shores of sydney harbour and started our modern era as a country.Sydney on line has an excellent online mobile friendly self guided walking tour. It starts at sailors home in the rocks at the end of george street and is a good walk past 31 points of interest down through the rocks. It is an easy walk and will save you money as there are commercial tours available. I find free is best when available as it keeps my budget under control.Whether you are an aussie or an international tourist, back packer or retiree this is a disability friendly easy walk. My recommendation is to give Tbe Rocks a big thumbs up. You won't be disappointed particularly if you visit on a weekend when the lower end of george street is transformed into a vibrant street market as well. Enjoy !!!"

Far more varied than the Paddington Markets with huge variety of clothes, accessories , Australian souvenirs, candles, soaps and jewellery.You can take a fun ride on a Harley Davidson, view under the Harbour Bridge or gawp in amazement at a cruise liner moored so close you just wanted to board her.Fresh corn on the cob spiked and smothered in butter were selling fast.Something for everyone and an entertaining attraction."

Last Saturday, was lovely sunny day, so off we went - me and Happy Hubby - to the Rocks.I am a child of the 70's and remember the Green Bans that the NSW Builders Labourers Federation placed on the demolition of this magnificent area. They were pilloried at the time, but wow, don't we love them now.Walking out of the train station at Circular Quay, always makes me feel happy. I glory in the view - the Bridge, The Opera House, The Ferries - this is Sydney and I'm never ever ever sick of it.Walk around towards the Rocks, listen to the buskers - I always give to buskers - I have my special buskers purse at the ready.Through the park and Cadman's Cottage.Up to the Rocks. The markets are always interesting - my special interest is the young guys who make jewellry out of the innards of mechanical watches - just wonderful and they know their stuff. They can tell you all about the pieces, where they come from, how they work - but I digress.There's plenty of good quality and reasonably priced food and drinks, there are plenty of souvenirs to buy - all manner of paraphernalia is available. Yes tourists come here, but I'm a Sydneysider - born and bred, and I come here all the time.Every time I come, I always think of Jack Mundey and his mates from saving these and other wonderfully historic spaces from demolition.You can google - Jack Mundey and Green Bans if you want to know more about the history of Sydney.

The buskers are very talented, and the clothing stalls bright and colourful. Often, there's an ocean liner docked in the Overseas Terminal and a chance to see it close-up.

The Sculpture is in sandstone with figures cut into the stone of a soldier, settlers and convict. These figures represent the original settlers to the area.What a piece of art there are lights on each side so it can be seen at night , for me this sculpture is as impressive as the opera house and the harbor bridge ,they say art is in the eye of the beholder -first impressions to me will last Long I'm my memory as long as the bridge and the the opera house.Mr Bud Bumas take a bow ."

My favourite is an early evening pub crawl (no obligation to get drunk though) with live entertainment and people watching a great way to observe some quirky characters in old fashioned pubs. If you're cashed up some of the best hotels in Sydney are right here."

The tour gave us a good history of the early days here, and it was really inspiring to see some of the original buildings and get an idea of what actually went on around these streets. An area your glad they preserved, even though the early days were very seedy! On Thursday and Friday they have an open market and we decided to combine that with walking the streets again. Check out the Nurses Walk, and Suez Canal and hopefully get the history. We also enjoyed a light snack in one of the many little cafes serving pastries. Also check out the market if your there - we didn't go at night, which is also supposed to be pretty special. The market is very similar to any open market here in the US, but was really fun to see some of the special talent - the guy creating absolutely beautiful pictures using paint cans! I would have LOVED to have taken a photo of him, but didn't want to disrespect his request that no photos be taken. He was amazing! Also the woman that made framed, multi-dementional pictures from Australian postage stamps! I'm sorry I didn't purchase one, but this was the first leg of our month long trip.There also, was a great little museum and I'm sorry I don't remember the name, but is was all about the history of Australia. Very, very impressed on the information and displays they had in such a small location on two floors. They even offered a treasure hunt for the kids, which I thought was great! As I said, this was a fun area of the city to spend several hours in. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did."

So the area was extremely busy as I am sure it is when any cruise ship is in port. They had market going the weekend we were there and it was very nice. I bought things to take home. The restaurants and shops were very busy and people were having a good time. The prices at the restaurants are high. We were going to stop for to try an Aussie Meat Pie and they wanted $19 just for the pie. We did not stop, but I did find one a few blocks later for $4.50. So be careful of that. Food in the Darling Harbor area is more affordable. The pubs are very entertaining...lots of people have a good time!!! It's worth a walk through at a minimum."

But the craic over the weekend is even better. There are some great sites around. The Observatory on Argyle Street is terrific - though don't try the climb unless you're fit! The Rocks is full of early colonial architecture - and history, like Australia's oldest pub. You can lose yourself there for hours. Decent street music acts come out at the weekend. Lots of nice eating places as well. As a photographer, I love all the opportunities The Rocks offers."

Because of its location close to the entrance to the Habour Bridge and Bridge Climb, there are some tourist traps here, but there are also some very fine restaurants and cafes, and a couple of little unique shops. You will also find the exclusive brands harbour-side. You can also just wonder down a set of steps into the harbour area and walk around to the Opera House whilst you are there.

When I visit our city offices for work meetings, I always spend time here. I would recommend it to tourists and locals alike. I think it is generally a safe area at night if you stick to the busy areas and avoid all those quite alleyways and side streets.

Rows of terrace house line the streets, many the subject of recent controversial sales, reaching an apex crowned by the historic Garrison Church on one corner and the seemingly ancient yet thoroughly contemporary Lord Nelson Hotel diagonally opposite.With the sun setting, our stroll culminated in a restful pre-booked seat at the very popular, renowned Fish at the Rocks Cafe located at the northern end of Kent Street.

Tourists and quay workers. Very hot in February, no shade near the opera house, so wear sunscreen and carry an umbrella if you cannot be in the sun. Park was nice but benches are limited and on crowded days you will need to be able to sit in the grass or on the cement curbs. Copenhagen Ice cream shop at the corner of the Quay was great but expensive (as is everything in Sydney). $14.00 for two small cups of ice cream. If you want to eat take away in this area, you have to go to the park and find some shade to enjoy your food with the birds. There are no tables to sit at anywhere unless you go into a restaurant. We ate at Hungry Jack ( Burger King in USA) and their tiny table area was gross and dirty. We took our food elsewhere. If you can make the climb, go up to Gloucester Street and visit the Susannah Place Museum. Must be able to climb lots of stairs. Spent about 6 hours down here and walking around the Rocks area. Try to find the back alley stairs in the daylight. There are secret passageways and small gardens and little pubs hidden everywhere."

Lovely old pubs and some top notch restaurants that you will need to book ahead to get the best table/views. Some are rather expensive but you are dining in some of the countries best eateries in beautiful surrounds. Some good hotels here too but costs can get a bit steep (location) so check out \"specials\". Great area to walk around day or night and to dine at an outdoor setting on the pavement is a must - a terrific way to get the vibe of this great city. Some good galleries here; including Aboriginal art. Bridge climbs can be organised from here too - dawn, dusk and day hikes offer panoramic views of the city/harbour (if you're up for it). Many houses/shops were lost with the construction of the Harbour Bridge and Cahill's Expressway so it is interesting to wander around here and imagine life pre those days. Ghost tours available too, if that's your thing."

The markets are fantastic as well with the foodies market on a Friday from 9am to 3pm and the craft markets on Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 5pm. There are a number of great watering holes as well with my favourite being the Harbourview sitting in the shade of the harbour Bridge.

But when I get around pretending to be a late 30's billionaire who, as luck would have it, stumbled across his ever increasing fortune overnight, I can't say I pretend that I own an entire city. But on any number of my very late night power walks around inner city Sydney, that is literally how I feel, like the man who owns Sydney. This is never more so than when I make it the 3km from my place to the Rocks. Catch it at the right hour on the right night/s of the week and the sheer wealth of history, the mishmash of settlement era workers cottages mixed with some of the city's most stunning hotels, all squeezed together on a relatively tiny chunk of land, smack bang underneath one of the most recognizable landmarks on earth, the imposing harbor bridge, is nothing short of magical. Now while many locals and visitors clamber to the area for the vibe and pace of night (and day) life, especially as a glamorous vantage point for so many annual festivals & events, I favor the Rocks when there is absolutely nothing on, when all I can hear are empty chips packets and discarded newspapers being blown down the streets and alleyways by the soothing harbor breeze, when I am truly alone with my city. On some nights it's as if the Bridge too is deserted of the typical non-stop moan of traffic heading back and forth and back and forth. I love the fact that my city is a city that does sleep, because on the nights she does, as I slowly make my way through the cobbled lane ways and side streets, under the bridge, along the wharf, if I listen very closely, I can nearly hear the steam engines and horse drawn carriages, the whips being cracked, and the street markets of 200 years ago. That was of course long before her title was transferred to my holding company in the Cayman Islands for taxation purposes."

If anyone goes to Sydney and does not visit this museum, they will not have a true feeling for this great city and its history. We found a shop where the owner just makes jewelry out of old watches.

There is a Big Dig going on to provide historical information on the area. There are plenty of places to eat and drink and close to the center of the city - at least close to the Four Seasons Hotel. The area is hilly with a lot of steps and close to the Harbor Bridge - a great place to walk and look at the city. The Rocks is a definite area to check out during the day or evening."

These days, you'll find designer shops and high class restaurants but if you care to dig deeper, you'll find a taste of Sydney's origins.The architecture in the Rocks, dominated by sandstone, generally remains intact and well kept. Head for one of the many pubs along George St if you'd like a cold beer in some very original housing (my favourites are the Mercantile or the Australian for some old Australian charm). If you head off George St, visit the Lord Nelson which is Australia's oldest pub and still brews some fantastic beers, sold across Sydney.For dining, you can't go past the entertainment block owned by the one consortium on Argyle. Our personal favourites are Sake and Cut but the open courtyard bar in Anannas is great on a summer evening.The best activities, outside of climbing the bridge if you haven't done that before, is a leisurely stroll around the markets, held in the weekend and mostly Sundays, when they close a part of George St off."

Follow cobblestone pathways and tented avenues of wonderful stalls selling anything from artisan jewellery and clothing, adorable dog collars, all things Australiana and delicious treats. A perfect spot for tourists, both international and local to find that special gift or souvenir, its simply a great place to enjoy its energetic atmosphere, have fun, be curious and find something nice, unique or even unusual. While there, its a great chance to check out the arcades nearby, with souvenir stores, boutiques and art galleries to find even more unique items to take home. With plenty of cafes, restaraunts and food stalls offering great places to sit, have coffee and enjoy a snack or meal. As a chocolate lover, I enjoyed the Guylian Caf\u00e9 where I had a lovely hot chocolate and an \u00e9clair. I've also tried the French bistro Baroque and Le Pain Quotadien for breakfast, which were both nice and relaxing with good food. Lowenbrau's is a meat lovers paradise and perfect for a hearty and fun lunch. For the markets, food outlets and stores, prices vary from the very reasonable to the ridiculous, and depending on what you're looking for, you're sure to find something to suit your budget. Overall I love coming to The Rocks Markets. Whether you're a tourist or a local, a newbie or a seasoned stall browser, its a wonderful place to vist or revisit again and again. It's a fun day out and walking down to Circular Quay to see our stunning harbour is a great way to enjoy Sydney at its best."

I usually spend the best part of my first day here and just wander round and take in all that I've forgotten, then up to the Mercantile for a jar. Perhaps its the little taste of home I'm in love with, with a huge number of Irish / Celtic Shops and Pubs. It reminds me that even so far away, I'm never that far from home."

Look out for the Sirius Building which was formally a social housing apartment block with million dollar views of the harbour and bridge. Built in the 1980s and originallyused for housing those requiring social housing. Really sticks out in The Rocks and is now being used for private apartments. The views from this block would be outstanding! The Rocks is a gorgeous place and very old and you can access the harbour bridge from The Rocks and walk along to Kiribilli. There is an amazing Saturday market at The Rocks with all sorts of interesting bits and pieces and gorgeous jewellery but rather expensive but quite unique!"

My wife was in heaven and even though her feet were hurting from out activities of the previous 3 days, she explored every inch of the market and she did some areas twice. If possible, let the wife do this activity with a friend."

And the best way to do that when visiting is learn how to use the buses, ferries, trams, trains, and taxis. They all begin and end here, at The Rocks. It is a close walk to the nearby cruise ship harbor, the iconic Sydney Opera House, Sydney Harbor Bridge Climb, street vendors, musicians, and artists. Haven't ever heard a didgeridoo being played? ... I mean ... really well? Chances are you will find a street musician playing out a tune with a beat that you have never experienced, but it is not to be missed on your visit. You can purchase all day, or two- or three- or more day passes for all the public transportation (except the taxis) at an extremely good price. The taxis may be faster and more convenient, but quite expensive. In most cases public transportation will take you anywhere you need to go in fairly short order."

This was the area where the original convicts who were brought here from England were told to go \"over to those rocks\" and construct shelters for themselves. There is a very interesting history in this area. Many of the original buildings are still standing thanks to some forward thinking residents who fought off developers who wanted to take over and build the land. In some of the hand make bricks that make up the walls of these buildings you can see marks made by the convicts or animal tracks made in the bricks before they dried hard.

It had limited tour hours and cost about ($8 aus) for a guided tour. It has been around since 1844. The area was built on the harbors rocky area, hence the name the \"Rocks\" it is a bit hilly and narrow. There are many restaurants and shops in this historical area. It is a very different part of Sydney, but nice just the same."

It's located on the southside of Sydney Harbour, within walking distance to Circular Quay. Historically, it's the site of Australia's first European settlement more than two centuries ago. The people of Sydney have done a marvelous job preserving the old buildings, and giving it a new lease of life by converting it to cafes, restaurants, hotels, specialty shops etc. It's an ideal place to spend a leisurely afternoon, and get lost amongst the quaint old buildings. On weekends, parts of the road will be closed for the weekend market, and you'll be spoiled for choice what to buy from the street vendors."

Highly recommended is The Rocks Walking Tour - an exceptionally fun, entertaining, cultural, and educational experience.

Saved from destruction by the actions of many concerned people when it was planned to be razed for a container terminal.. One can see the vestiges of how the architecture was in the early days of the colony, and the huge bond stores and cottages alike have been faithfully restored to house businesses, artisans' studios, great restaurants and little cafes. We went on a Sunday, and the place was buzzing with a great market place atmosphere. The passenger terminus is nearby - though that is being renovated at present. One can walk alongside the Harbour to see a spectacular view of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House on the other side and walk around to Circular Quay where the harbour ferries leave from. Walk along the road through the Argyle Cut up to the Garrison Church - also well worth going inside. The buses to Millars Point stop in this area. Wear walking shoes, as the pavements are a bit uneven in places, and there are often steps to get from one road level to another. The area is literally built on 'the Rocks'!! Well worth the visit.

Whether you are looking for souvenirs, or just out for a stroll you will find it memorable. The Rocks is so close to Sydney Harbour, you can stroll down along Circular Quay and what great photo memories you can create with the Opera house and the Sydney Harbour Bridge as back drops it's one of the most beautiful harbours in the world. And when there's a big cruise ship docked at Circular Quay it is just magic. Also at the Rocks is a selection of great accommodation, from budget through to extravagant indulgence. I recommend it for a weekend to spoil that someone special in your life."

You can even take a motor bike or trike ride around the city and Neutral Bay (helmuts and jackets supplied). We did this and it was great fun. The historical buildings and cobbled paths add to the area's charm with the added bonus off being right next to Circular Quay, the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. If you go down the steps to Campbell Cove and walk around the harbour forefront you get a great close up view of these attractions.

There are cafes & 'watering holes' aplenty intermingled with art galleries & historic buildings. This is all accompanied by the scenic backdrop of our beautiful harbour with its iconic Opera House & Harbour Bridge.

Travellers are probably used to the high prices and cynical attitude of grocery type stores that operate around tourist districts the world over. You need to get some basics and its the only place available...o.k. You put it down to part and parcel of travel abroad.This place however, takes it to a new level. It's located directly underneath the Clocktower on the corner of Harrington and Argyle streets in the rocks district of Sydney.Its a medium/small supermarket. First thing you notice are there are almost no prices marked on the items on the shelves.When you get to the checkout the 'Customer service' consists of an openly contemptuous attitude delivered by a Middle Eastern Male.I have been to this establishment several times and confirmed it is a manner shared by all the staff I have encountered.Unfriendly bordering on hostility.As expected the prices are very high. Needless to say, they will not be getting any more of my custom."

During our stay we:cycled across the Harbour Bridge, Ferry to Taronga Zoo, climbed the Harbour Bridge, watched the many local Brazilians gathered at Observatory Hill on a Sunday performing their Capoeira Dance to only us, Ferry to Fort Dension for lunch, chilled at the many outdoor restaurants/live music alongside the harbour at the OperaHouse, The Rocks Markets on a weekend (brilliant) and that is only the beginning...

It was a glorious day and so we wondered through the markets, which I have to say had a lot of quality things I would not normally associate with a market in a tourist area. I actually purchased two Christmas presents while wondering around to take back to the UK with me this year. After that we walked to Campbell Cove where there is a group of Restaurants to have lunch. While it was OK, it was a expensive for what it was, so would suggest going to one of the local pubs in the area (of which there are many) to have lunch a drink. From there its an easy walk around to the Opera house and stopping off at Opera Bar for an afternoon drink while listening to live music."

The trick is to get off George street and wander the back lane ways. This is a very safe area so have no fear.Every pub you pass has a story .For lunch or dinner I recommend walking all the way down the bottom , around under the bridge and up the hill slightly to the Harbour view hotel.Opposite old terrace houses , its bar and restaurant on the 3rd floor of this historical pub has a wonderful view of the bridge and harbour.Don't forget on weekends there is a massive market selling a variety of hand crafted items as well as various foods .

Most people think of Australia as a new country; shiny and, perhaps, in the case of Sydney, slightly superficial.Contra this view, of course, is the ancientness of the country's Aboriginal population and culture, anywhere between the conventional 60,000 BP (Before Present) to the astonishing 150,000 BP. So-called \"settler Australia\", those of us whose history in Australia at most remotes to 1788, may try to appropriate this sophisticated and fascinating Aboriginal element, but it is more than a bit of a stretch.When you visit the old Sydney area called \"The Rocks\", try to imagine people living on this land without the brick and stone constructions that you have come to see. Those rocks that are covered by docks and hotels supplied a resident indigenous population with an abundance of luscious food diversity.So you will find the settler \"Rocks\" of today. There are one or two of Sydney's most expensive restaurants, along with fast food easy feeding places. The numbers that visit this historic part of settler Sydney tend to eleminate the tacky and tasteless: they close after a while as people are seeking something else.That something else is the sort of history that most people come to a modern city to see: solid human constructions, comfortable hotels (let's be honest, if we can afford it) and a reasonable feed at a level that is affordable and attractive.Food and drink are not just to satisfy bodily needs, especially not for the visitor struggling with an unfamiliar milieu, but to delight and entice.Whilst there are many parts to The Rocks, there is a totality that I am trying to portray.Visitors can come back to this place many times, as do residents like me.Couples can find intimate places for their pleasure and families at whatever age will be able to occupy themselves. There are quiet corners as well as raucous night spots for a group of friends. A solo traveller will not feel alone for long.Not that long ago the narrow lane ways were not to be frequented in the night, but rarely is The Rocks anything other than a vibrant touristic experience.If you can, as a visitor, try to stay at one of the variety of accommodations in the area so that when you return from other places, you have a lively and interesting evening.I have lived in Sydney most of my life and find The Rocks still a place to visit."

For a long time it housed what was then known as the 'slums'. Gradually through trial and protest it now remains as part of the Sydney Harbour foreshore historical area and an interesting area to stroll around.It is probably easier to walk from Town Hall Station to the Rocks rather then the other way round, however, Circular Quay Station or ferry is is another option with a flat stroll of around 15 mins. Car parking is available but like most cities, it can fill up quickly and cost too.Sydney Visitor Centre at The Rocks is located on the corner of Argyle and Playfair streets and is a good way to get some information. A walking map will help in identifying the historical buildings, locating museums and restaurants in the area. On Saturday and Sunday you will find the Rocks Markets with one off or local designer items plus on Friday there is a foodie market with home made delicacies and onsite food for a late breakfast or lunch.This area is best explored on foot or bike with just one or two steep places to negotiate. Late at night you can dine in many different restaurants - some renowned. Allow at least a few hours particularly at weekends when there is a festive air from the markets and day trippers.Enjoy your experience!"

A visit to the Harbour bridge is a must and just strolling the streets provides an insight into the beginnings of Australia.Make sure you visit, if you're an Aussie, it's a great way to get to know a bit of Australian history and for tourists from abroad, it's a must visit, you'll be sure to enjoy."

Not that it changes, but its my Sydney 'fix'.This is the only place in Oz where you can get a feel for the 18th and early 19th century, very north european in its old buildings, little lanes and walkways and cobbled streets and on the weekend a street market. All genuine, updated over time but none the less reflecting the really old Oz.Meander, don't set a time frame, wander through the back lanes and the streets. It can feel a little commercial/touristy but still worth the wander. Little shops and arcades throughout and the Museum of Contemprary Art is worth the visit.Stay in Harrington St. This is the middle of the precinct with easy access to everything including the Quay and the ferries and railway station and the Bridge and the Opera House.

My wife and I often just drive to the Quay and spend the day on a weekend just to get away from it all. We walk every where have lunch at the many restaurants, pubs, and market eateries there's no shortage of eateries. I always bring my SLR and shoot some great photos of the old Heritage Building, Harbour activities and street photography. There is an open market at the end of George Street every weekend. Just a few minutes from the commercial area is residential, where you see some old Victorian terrace houses, old schools,and quaint Chapels, old milk bars,and beautifully printed tiled Pubs that have been well preserved. We never tire of visiting \"The Rocks, Sydney\"."

It was great value for money and the guide was obviously so passionate about the history she made it come alive.

It is a souvenir hunters delight, but like most sites, don't expect to find many genuine items, (ie made in Australia, not China, Japan, etc.) particularly if you are wanting Aboriginal artifacts. There are dozens of restaurants, the best being alongside the harbour at Circular Quay where you will always find buskers and also the Harbour Ferry wharves.

The decor and architecture, being an old bank - all add to the experience. For starters we had the house chopped salad, the crab , and steak tartar and oysters all of which were very nice. Also I had to take a phone call for about ten minutes and our waiter noticed I was away and waited to bring the food until I returned which was nice. We all had different steaks all cooked perfectly. The bone in Rib Eye was particularly nice. For dessert only one person ordered ( me !) The salted Carmel and chocolate tart was excellent. All in all an excellent meal. Although price wise if you are there on expense account you might be glad you are."

My husband and I have gone to The Rocks for lunch and dinner often and to just catch up with family. It's a great place to just walk around and turn up little lanes and walk ways. It is probably the richest spot in Sydney historically and as I walk around there, I think of the stories Dad told me and feel very pleased we have kept the old features of the area.

Pick up some tourist brochures there with a map. Lunch at any number of waterfront restaurants there. Continue walking around under the Harbour Bridge on Hickson a Road to Walsh Bay Wharves, home of the Sydney Theatre and Dance companies. Views across to North Sydney. Take the steps back up to Millers Point in Argyle Street. From there you can have a drink at The Lord Nelson Hotel, with it's own beer brewed on the premises. Walk further to the Garrison Church, Australia's first church. You can go for a walk from the bus terminus there up Observatory Hill and see out to Sydney Heads from there. The Bureau if Meteorology is up there and you can go in and view a great presentation if how the weather is predicted. You can also learn about the harbour's history and importance to the colony of Sydney. The S H Irwin Gallery and the National Trust is also,up there if you are interested in viewing art and objects of preservation. You can walk across the Harbour Bridge from there and back across the other side. There are signs everywhere. It's free, unlike the expensive Bridge Walk, where you are chained in and walk up over the steel arch of the longest single span arch bridge in the world. If you want to do the bridge walk, you can book that via their office in Cumberland St. Continue along Cumberland St and you will find old pubs, archeological remains of old 18th C houses and various museums, such as Museum of Childhood and Mary Reby's convict history.

Everyone seemed to have a story or stories to tell on the history of the area, Circular Quay which was within walking distance, their own BridgeClimb (we had just finished ours when we walked over to the Rocks, and the Discovery Museum is a must see. If for no other reason than there is no charge which after some sticker shock at Sydney restaurants and stores was a welcome break. VIVID was awesome here to and if you can plan your visit to Sydney around VIVID, I would definitely do. It is well worth what will probably be more crowds than usual as well as some event pricing at hotels.

There is a very nice, moderately priced jewellery shop along the back alley near the Italian restaurant. I chose four pieces that I anticipate I will wear a lot as it goes with my other silver pieces and the greys and pearls suit my style. The shopkeeper was also friendly - his wife makes most of the pieces. I will probably go back there. It just feels a little tired but maybe my recollection is just more vivid than the reality."

The area itself is unique and on the weekends there is a weekend market under the bridge. We were able to get unique gifts to take home, and a few for ourselves. We had a great afternoon exploring the area with its sculptures, quiet streets and little boutiques. Even without the weekend market the area is great for exploration. Even though it is near the busy part of town, it feels miles away and very relaxing. If you are in Sydney, go for a visit."

Gets its name in 1788 as all the buildings were made from the local sandstone which is in abundance in the area.The Rocks is tiny only about 0.2 km2 (0.1 sq mi) but is chock a block full of history.Standing in The Rocks and looking east you look across Port Jackson or better known as Circular Quay (it's not circular any more). This was the prefered settlement prefered by the first fleet after Captain Cook's landing site at Kernel in Botany Bay was rejected due to its very sandy ground and was not suitable for growing crops immediately.Right in your line of site is one of the modern wonders of the world on Bennelong Point,The Sydney Opera House.This was the winning design in a competition for an \"Australian Opera House\" submitted by a young Danish architect Jorn Utzon in 1957. He said he came up with the design by cutting an orange into segments, thus its truely unique shape and form.Unfortunately he never saw his master piece completed due to differences with the NSW State Government. The project was completed by the NSW public works and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in October 1973. Jorn Utzon died without ever laying his eyes on the completed building.About face and you will be looking accross George St and into the heart of The Rocks.As the oldest settlement in Australia, some of the oldest and most beautiful building still exist here, however not the oldest. That title of Australia's oldest building is in Parramatta, which will be for another review another day.The buildings in the Rocks area in George St, Argyle St, Hickson Rd, Lower Fort St & Cumberland St are some of the oldest. They consist of mainly smaller terrace type homes, and working buildings. As this is Australia's oldest shipping port (and still the busiest) many of these buildings were used for food, drink and entertainment of all sorts. Still today, Australia's oldest pub is still in operation in The Rocks and is worth a visit. I am pleasently surprised that since this small little gem of a place is right in the heart of Sydney and right on the edge of the most wonderful harbour in the world, many of the eateries pubs and resturants are still very reasonably priced and very affordable. Children are welcome in the area and most places have kids menus available.It is very easy for 2 adults who like their food and drink to have a good time for under $50AUDBe careful as The Rocks shuts down pretty early during the week, you will struggle to find food at a pub after 9pm, some bigger places (nightclubs) have food till around 11pm.Food at one of the biggest nightclubs in The Rocks was quite reasonably priced and the food is plentyful, very tasty and the beer is cold.You will also find some of Australia's MOST expensive dining in The Rocks as well.Many 5 star, Michelin rated & world famous chef owned resturants are to be found here so be sure of pricing before you eat. Most establishments (except the high class) all have menus outside for you to check whats on and how much.On weekends there is The Rocks Markets, but these are not now as good as they once were.A walk up Argyle St and right into Lower Fort St at the top of the hill will bring you in sight of the dominating Sydney Harbour Bridge. This bridge has been looking over The Rocks area since it's opening in 1932. Cumberland St and George streets are next on your walk towards the bridge and of course there are many watering holes along the way. The Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb offices are in Cumberland St, so If you are game to climb the bridge, this is where you go.The Rocks can be very loud from time to time and very quiet from time to time, but there is always something interesting to see and do and eat."

Despite the fact I have visited The Rocks so many times, and despite the fact it is definitely inundated with tourists and the usual accompanying gift shops etc.....I still love every it every time I chance to be there. Because despite the tourist trade, I can always find atmospheric little lanes and alleys away from it all - there are always quirky photo opportunities to be found, quiet corners where for a second you can be transported back in time, a la 'Playing Beatie Bow'. Away from the bustle of George street, there are many, less visited gems - just grab a map and a bottle of water and wander! If you're serious about getting to know the Rocks, do some research on its history before you hit the streets - its a great way to set the scene and have a better understanding of the Rocks and it's role in early Australian history."

The old teller boxes and bank is in it's glory as you enter this beautiful and Historic Building as is the old CBC bank now named the National both which are in George Street. Both beautiful, historical and now glorious in a new life"

When visiting the Rocks area head away from the harbour up a gentle hill and you will start to find glimpses of Old Sydney town which thankfully avoided the demolition ball and developers greed. Away from the tourist tack you can see original homes, a local pub or two and the Garrison church Stop by the Lord Nelson brew pub for a refreshing local ale. All in all good for a peaceful meander, some unique views of the harbour bridge and more and avoidance of the cruise liner hordes!"

I thoroughly recommend a pub crawl through the Rocks. Its something that everyone should experience at least once in their life."

I must admit, I rarely visit, but when I do, I like this area because of all the old buildings. There's a lot of history here, but sadly it's not as concentrated as somewhere like Gastown in Vancouver, and therefore lacks the 'wow' factor. It's best combined with a short tour - of the rocks, the water tunnels under the city, the tour of the jail and seedy side of Sydney or the ghost & scary tour. It adds to your knowledge and appreciation of the area to know what it's about and also, you'll then start to see things that you may have otherwise overlooked."

For free! Allocate a couple of hours to wander round, even the cafes do great food and cakes if you just want to sit around. They do candy-making in The Rocks Centre, you can watch it being made (I watched it being made with a koala running through it, very clever) and then can of course buy some afterwards. Ugg boots all seemed to be in a sale up to 30% off, if that floats your boat. Visit Susannah's place for an hour at 2.00pm, 3.00pm or 4.00pm for a 1 hour tour (8 bucks) of 4 old terraced houses, more interesting than it sounds as you can see how the early settlers on The Rocks lived, and the guide Ivan has plenty of stories and local knowledge."

The plaques are painted (and lacquered) with different Sydney scenes & designs. One of them an aboriginal theme - a nice gift. We had afternoon tea there and just enjoyed taking in the atmosphere."

This is the area full of small shops, kitsch cafes, restaurants, etc. It was the site of the first European settlement. It has evolved from a place of open sewers and squalid alleyways and shameless pubs to on this particular Sunday, the streets were packed with a large combination of what can only be described as farmers market meets large craft show. Booth after booth of stuff \u2013 mostly local craft issued \u2013 but some items that you be proud to own made by some local craftsperson. These narrow streets take to you the base of the Harbour bridge. It is a fascinating place to explore on foot, for the history of the buildings is retold on countless historical signs.

This is probably my favourite area of Sydney, though it can be quite crowded during times due to the vicinity to the harbour and thus a prime spot for tourists.The area dates by to the late 19th century and historically had the reputation of being a slum area, frequented with sailors, prostitutes and industry workers. It's since been gentrified, with the buildings and much of the area still retaining its original architecture. The sidewalks are now lined with a lot of restaurants and cafes, as well as shops. For me, it's reminiscent of the Distillery District in Toronto, Canada or areas in NYC such as LES.Every Saturday there is a market and becomes overtaken by local artisans selling handmade jewelry, clothing, artwork, soaps, oils, bags. If you can time your visit, I'd make the effort to check the market out! (I had spotted a ring that I fell in love with but didn't purchase it. I consequently had to wait a week for the market to reopen and it took some time trying to find the vendor who sold it, as he was in a different spot!)There's a lot of windy streets, little alleys that will lead you to more quiet areas so I would encourage you to wander the area during an afternoon and see where it takes you...definitely some great photo opportunities (lots of wedding photography shoots in the area too) I'd grab an early lunch in the area to avoid high peak crowds, or afternoon tea/beer."

I think the Sydney council should look again at the issues and refurbish the area to protect their history. On the weekend we were there, there was an open air food court which sold food from around the globe at reasonable prices. There were shops to suit all budgets in the area from cheap to chic.

The photograph in this review shows The Russell Hotel, a true boutique establishment, with multi-level floors and Victorian decoration. If you can afford it and don't mind the lack of glitz, The Russell is an excellent place to stay: I recommend it always to visitors.There are weekend markets and a variety of speciality shops, as well as the restored buildings. There are walking tours of The Rocks, although I never have taken one. Some people like a bit of background information whilst others just want to soak in the atmosphere.It is best not to drive to The Rocks as parking is not easy.

Sadly Sydney has lost a lot of its historic buildings and precincts as developers moved in during the 60's. The Rocks was also slated for massive destruction and redevelopment as the history of the area was dismissed and the place branded as a slum. The \"Battle fro the Rocks\" saw the start of community action to protect the precinct and after long legal and civil disobedience, particularly on behalf of the Builders Laborers Unions.So now the area has been rejuvenated and a jewel to walk through its narrow walkways and back streets. Buildings and open spaces hide behind each other and date back to the earliest days of the Sydney story.Cobbled streets, a mix of museums and great pubs, maritime history and some of Sydney's smartest restaurants and nightspots. Artisan's markets take over Lower George St on Sundays as well as little boutique shops and craft shops adorn the neighbour hood.Walk up the hill under the huge road archway of the Harbour Bridge to the Western side of the Rocks - still a residential precinct and a true village to itself. Visit the Garrison Church, Lord Nelson Hotel or even older Hero of Waterloo - Sydney's oldest pub.And finish up on top of Observatory Hill for a spectacular view of the western Harbour, City and ultimately the best view of Sydney Harbour Bridge."

I happily spent a couple of hours and appreciated the way the stalls were laid out so that you could wander down one side right to the end then come back up the otherside and not miss anything. Getting there and back was easy as my B&B was within walking distance of Central Station from where a free shuttle bus does a continuous circuit to Circular Quay.Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get to the Friday Foodies Market which would have been of great interest to me, but such is life!"

Of course, the tourist industry has made a big impact, but I liked the way that the history of the area had been preserved not only in the buildings and museum, but also with plaques and boards on the sides of buildings which we enjoyed reading as we strolled around the area.

I stayed in The Rocks 20 years ago but never walked around the neighborhood. You can walk through the alleys and byways by yourself, but to get the real flavor of The Rocks, you should take one of the tours. The tour guides tell you about the history of the area as well as folklore. The Rocks was established as a neighborhood shortly after the colony's formation in 1788. Over the years there were many attempts to demolish The Rocks. However, due to a variety of circumstances (wars, unions and politics), The Rocks was renovated and became a tourist and commercial area. A great portion of the commercial area are the pubs and restaurants that can be abundantly found throughout The Rocks. There is also a well staff tourist bureau in one of the buildings."

On Fridays there is a foodie market which has some interesting multi cultural offerings, it is obviously extremely popular with locals as there were a lot of bussines people around lunch time queing for food. The prices are good and you are spoiled for choice. On Saturday and Sunday there are general markets as well. We were there on Valentines day and there were some lovely local art and craft people selling good quality jewelry paintings and the like. The shopping in the arcade next to the tourist center is good and it is easy to stroll down under the Harbour Bridge for a look, I wouldn't bother with the ice cream from the van though it was pretty awful."

It is situated on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour / Northwest of CBD. It is short walk from the Sydney Opera House and Circular Quay. It is restored 19th century village at the Southern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is considered to be the birthplace of Australia. The area features cobbled streets and squares, gas lamps, craft shops and small restaurants. Here too are several historic buildings, including one of the city\u2019s oldest, Cadman\u2019s Cottage, built in 1816, and two of Sydney\u2019s oldest pubs. It is recommended that visitors seek information and a map from The Rocks Visitor\u2019s Centre (in George Street) in order to make the most of the neighborhood and its many attractions, which include museums, view sites, markets, monuments and buildings. From The Rocks it is also possible to access the Pylon Lookout on the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge for an amazing view of Harbor and beyond. Step back in time and surround yourself in Sydney's most historic precinct known as The Rocks. Discover the many sandstone buildings, cobblestone streets and monuments marking moments in history which enable visitors to gain an appreciation of Sydney's foundation as a convict built settlement. The Rocks is a popular destination for school history excursions. Visit to Discovery Museum is free. Although historic in nature, The Rocks offers some of Sydney's finest dining and entertainment experiences available. Rocks Market operates each weekend 10am till 5pm."

If you happen to be staying at a hotel near the Rocks, by all means skip the expensive hotel breakfast and wander down to one of the delicious looking bakeries or cafes.

Its history is well documented with relevant signage on just about every alleyway and historic building, some of which have been re-invented for the modern day scene. The cobbled streets are lined with eateries, galleries, craft places and niche market shops with very little evidence of the touristy plastic trash one sees so often. No-one trying to push flyers and tourist literature into your hand either. If you have a desire to cross the bridge on foot it's only another 63 steps up to the roadway but you have to walk a fair way before you're actually over water. If you're walking the bridge in summer, starting from The Rocks side affords what little shade there is to be found. The Glenmore pub adjacent to the steps up from Circular Quay boasts a rooftop bar with superb views but don't visit on a Friday late afternoon if you're seeking peace and quiet! I so wish I'd heard about the guided walking tour prior to spending time in the area but it didn't appear on any of the tourist literature I'd picked up. Would have been worth the $25 I'm sure even if, again, they don't acknowledge overseas senior cards. Why oh why is Australia so mean in this regard, especially as it must now be close to the top of the most expensive cities in the world to visit."

You can also easily walk to Circular Quay, catch a Ferry and try other Sydney Harbour attractions.Don\u2019t forget to take your camera for shot of historic buildings, the Bridge, Opera House, Tall Ships and even Cruise Ships."

It's fun to walk around. Even without the market, the whole area is just adorable, and filled with wonderful restaurants, cafes and pubs. You can sit outdoors and people watch. Or have a cup of flat white coffee (sort of like cafe au lait) in the French bakery, where the staff has thick French accent. If I have to choose a place to go back to (among Darling Harbor, the beaches, Circular Quay or CBD), this would be it."

I am sure these vendors are there some on one are days of the week We can back to this area on our last day so I could eat a steak (kangaroo), I like my beef steaks medium well but the kangaroo was prepare medium which was very red. It was ok, not like a beef steak to me. The restaurant is on the first corner as you enter the area from the city. We met couples that had been in Australia for a month or more, they all had spent some time in The Rock area. I was able to exchange money and sometime ask for five more dollars for the exchange. Look for the candy-man, he and his wife are great to talk too. We visited them a second time licorice and some jellybeans to eat at the hotel and bring back home. Great trip!"

The vibe of the buildings in this street was different with the historic building near Hyde Park and Royal Botanical Garden. The Rocks felt warmer and more inviting. I imagined it to be dull and dry when I looked at the pictures on the web, but it didn't felt like that at all when I was there.The day I visited was quite hot, but there's enough trees and shades from the shop that makes your walk pleasant. I even went in a small street called Nurse Walk where you can find a nice button shop (it has various buttons from cute to sophisticated hand made ones), stones and crystal shop (the owner really understands her stones, if you're interest with alternative healing) and nice coffee shop and cafes. There's a very small alley to go out from Nurse Walk to George St. where there's printed tins in men or women silhouette wearing vintage clothing that has explanation on the Rock's history. I visited on Saturday, so there were some spots that had Saturday markets. The goods that were sold was sooo cute and unique.There were people who sold decals, wood works, home decorative, accessories and lots of clothes.Obviously, being Sydney's oldest area, you find lots of Sydney's oldest, like Pubs, Cafe, Resto, Hotel, Banks. They still keep the vintage look.I didn't try any of those places, since I was keeping space for Pancake on the Rocks pancakes which serves huge, sweet pancakes.If you're interested in art, just near Pancake on the Rocks, there's Ken Dome's gallery for you to visit.Apart from the history, the ambiance makes it one of the must place to visit when you're in Sydney :)"

You'll go through the excavation sites of the old buildings and think you're in Rome or Greece with all the terraced stone. There is also an Observatory hill with terrific views and a bunch of hotel restaurants throughout with affordable good value meals. Great stories abound in this area of convicts and murders and public hangings and Australia's largest bank robbery. A must!"

The only negative I can think of is the parking situation which is pretty much non-existent but remember this is Sydney so it is a massive issue already. The Markets run at the weekends and I think there's a food market on the Friday?! I love the wide variety on products and goods on sale here, particularly the jewellery as I do love my accessories and it's even better when you know they've been made with love and no one else is going to be wearing them! Infact I'm wearing one of the beautiful necklaces I recently bought on a beautifully warm and sunny day in Sydney, just here in London town on a drizzly day yet it still looks as bright and stunning as when I picked it out that day and reminds me of another fab time in Sydney and at The Rocks and I've received loads of compliments on it too. The stallholders are friendly and welcoming and many chat to you and tell you stories about the pieces they've made / are selling. Make this one of your must visit hotspots in Sydney - whether you're a local or a tourist - you won't be disappointed!"

There was a little museum and an old house and small \"reproduction\" store, but it was quiet. The historic aspects and significant buildings lacked signage and there wasn't a place to get a clear image of what that early settlement was like (dioramas, diaries, a short movie, scale models of ships) --nothing \"brought it to life\". At night there was a bit more romance to the area, with a variety of interesting lighting, the harbor lights and the beautiful Opera House glowing on the other , and a few of the bars having live music, including the oldest bar in Sydney.

I often visit the Rocks Sydney when I have meetings which we usually dine at our favourite restaurant Phillips Foote.The rocks has many stores including designer brands. I can't say it's not expensive to shop here but it's Sydney after all so everything is expensive.The restaurants are great here. I recommend Phillips Foote as it's a great small restaurant and it's a fun environment. You get to cook your now steak and salads and sauces are for free.Due to some of the buildings, The Rocks is quiet interesting. Being close to the Quay does help otherwise you can only so much shop at Burberry...If your in Sydney from interstate or your from overseas, I suggest a visit to the Rocks. I recommend you visit Phillips Foote and the Galleria. After that cross the road and go walk to the Opera House."

When we first arrived we were hungry and found a joint we were unable to locate on google maps after the fact. The food was good, but we regret tipping around 13% when apparently tipping like that isn't needed in Australia (and it was not cheap food).Overall it was a great experience.

Lovely place to visit if you like old fashioned, well-maintained architecture with a lovely selection of interesting one-off shops and restaurants. Not the place to bargain hunt, but definitely the place to source a unique memento of Sydney, whether jewellery, clothing or art work. Try to visit on Fri - Sun, when a street market is full of goodies such as farm-bottled olive oils and vinegars.Enjoy!"

It has many of the first hotels dotted around the area showing the early architecture and also complimented by the new hotels where you can enjoy a wide range of food or relax over a drink at any of the bars in the area. Walking around the area you take in the harbour views, shop for gifts and enjoy the early history of Australia or sit and relax and take in the view watching the water traffic including the ferries and fellow travellers and locals all enjoying what the area has to offer. Definitely a spot to give a visitor a range of photographic choices and memories."

The food is a great alternative to the normal food courts or the cafes in the surrounding areas.

I love the variety they have in the markets, ranging from paintings to clothing to souvenirs.

Walk up George Street to the business areas for cheaper food and to Pitt Street Mall for cheaper shopping and food with a greater range and options. Those who are interested will also note the absence of references to Australia's indigenous people in this area. This oversight is a sad reflection of the uneasy relationship Australia has with its original inhabitants to this day. That being said, the Rocks is an area of visual joy - don't just judge the buildings on their age but think about what the constructors had (or more tellingly, did not have) in terms of tools and resources to have created what they did.

Try to avoid this one as the food is just terrible and totally overpriced. They have no idea of food and service is shocking. I know, it is a tourist spot but as long as the money coming from tourists is good enough one should deliver. I had a cesar salad which had nothing in common with the real thing. Ordinary mixed salad out of the bag, big stripes of awefull ham and cutted pieces with dry chicken and a readymade cesar salad sauce out of the bottle - that's it. I can't decribe the taste, left it uneaten on the plate. Hubby had a Panini with chicken which I thought was a sensible choice sitting in a bakery. Well, he didn't finish it either, the bread was stale, the chicken dry and even the slice tomato on it had seen better days. It sets us back AU$ 35.50 which I would rather have donated then wasted on crap food."

I suggest, for a relaxed ramble, that one visits the Rocks during the week and avoids the office midday lunch hour. For a more hectic experience go at the weekend when the Rocks arts and crafts markets are being held.A good way to start a walk of the Rocks is to commence at Circular Quay and then progress into the rocks along the Harbour Foreshore with the Opera House and Harbour Bridge adding to the spectacle,Visit the lovely Garrison Chapel in the heart of the Rocks, where I actually got married, and the small cluster of old Sydney cottages that retain their colonial charm."

There are numerous small boutique shops selling anything from souvenirs to artworks and some very expensive opals. There are plenty of small cafes with great atmosphere, lots of alleyways, mostly all cobbled, leading down to the Harbour. There are always lots of tourists there, and it's always bustling and busy but there's never enough time to explore.

If you're intrigued about the convicts coming to Australia and what it was like back then, and basically the history of Australia, you would enjoy the area and spending a day walking around. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes and be ready to climb hills, stairs, and walk on uneven ground. This was especially challenging for my elderly father who can see out of only one eye, but we took our time and they stopped to rest wherever they could. Here and there are markers to tell you things, but mainly it's the buildings and surroundings and how they deteriorated over time, and remarkable to see how some places were restored and some were left \"as is\" and how they function with it that way. The architecture, from regular housing buildings to larger business buildings, is amazing.You have to be willing to walk down alleys if you see a shop, because most of the time, that will lead you someplace else. There's an actual place where you can see what was left from a housing unit and how utterly small the rooms were. Great photo op! Lots of little shops everywhere, eateries and even a travel/information center with restrooms and a fabulous souvenir shop, amongst a mall of sorts. UGG products everywhere. You are also walking in the area where you go for the Sydney Bridgeclimb, which is behind the bridge on the side. We ate lunch where the had an elevator for the top floor restaurant, literally by the bridgewalk climbers with a fantastic view of Sydney Harbor Bridge! After spending the day there, we walked away wth a better understanding of Australia's culture."

I brought one of his painting because it was so amazing how he created pictures of Sydney with spray paint. I thought some of the stalls the items for sale were a little expensive, I collect license plates from where I go and the stall had them but selling them for $25 so I decided on the Spray Paint Painting instead because it was better.

It is a very nice area, a small village on the edge of the big city, however, it comes across as a bit fake and artificial, like an historical recreation for tourists.This being said it is obviously a Must See when in Sydney as it is really a great spot from where you can see both the magnificent Harbour Bridge and Opera House."

This precinct reflects what the early colony looked like,characterised by cobbled pavements,narrow side sreets,dockside warehouses,pubs and shopfronts that reflect the area's maritime history. Heritage is what you are experiencing,which makes this area vibrant historically and lively with pedestrian traffic. A market is held every Saturday which showcases aussie artisanship,and while here a great place to explore is Susannah Place Museum which examins the working-class domestic history of the area and the Rocks Discovery Museum,giving you the background to the Aboriginal and maritime history. My suggestion is to start with a coffee at Campbells Storehouses overlooking the waterfront. These bondstores contain restaurants catering to a range of tastes. Relax with the bustle of boats criss-crossing the harbour. Take note of the pulleys that used to haul cargo from the wharves,up at the top of the buildings. Now you are. travelling. CHECK OUT THE sAILORS'hOME,A GALLERY FOR ART LOVERS WITH A GOOD tHAI EATERY BELOW. dWARFED BY THIS BUILDING IS CADMAN'S cOTTAGE WHICH WILL FURNISH ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT tHE hARBOUR TOURS AVAILABLE. For a genuine 'Ye Old' world dont miss the Argyle Stores housing retail,fashion and eateries around a cobbled courtyard. Good vibes and ambience....Amble further up the hill to the Garrison Church for a taste of military place of worship,but your goodness will be sorely tested at The Hero of Waterloo,a picturesque inn serving brews and spirits.

This area was one of the earliest established during the British colonization of Australia and was a bustling port venue for the early settlers. Today it is considered to be an iconic destination when visiting Sydney. So, the question remains, \u2018What can you do at The Rocks?Well, for one thing, it is located in one of the oldest building sites in Australia, easily accessible to and from the harbour side. Not far from where millions of immigrants got off their ship after weeks of voyaging to the land Down Under. The architecture is a storybook reminder of the lives who helped build early Sydney - the sandstone steps, the old pubs, the iron fences. You can stand on George Street and take yourself back in time. Some streets are still lined with the old sandstone blocks chiselled by the early convicts whose sweat and hardship helped build the city. The Rocks sits on a bit of a high spot in Sydney so you can actually look down into the famous Sydney Harbour (British English).The caf\u00e9\u2019s, restaurants, the galleries, souvenir shops, boutique stores, the buskers and also the Museum of Contemporary Art all are important elements of what really occurs in this great historic venue. However, if there is a \u2018must see\u2019 it would be The Rocks Markets which adds to its rustic flavour. It reminds me so much of the wonderful markets I frequented in Europe, especially the ones just outside the ancient walls of Como, Italy. Here you can buy just about anything you desire whilst enjoying Sydney\u2019s world famous sites. The markets are open Saturday and Sunday from 10am till 5pm. I believe the Friday markets host specialties of different cuisine. For more information you can also visit http://www.therocks.com/sydney-Shopping-The_Rocks_Markets.htm.The indigenous Gadigal people who once flourished here and were one with this area of Mother Earth should be recognized. As a memory frozen in time The Rocks Markets is also a perfect place to eat, drink and enjoy good old Aussie hospitality\u2026 and if you have had one too many drinks you might get to hear the distant voices of the ancient gritty sailors and port hands singing their songs whilst spilling drink over the olden rough wooden tables\u2026 Salvin0."

I am from Sydney, but live in London, so perhaps that allows me to look at The Rocks from both the perspective of a local, as well as a visitor. The buildings and history in The Rocks is great and well worth the time and effort to walk around and consider. The shops are disappointing, full of tourist nonsense and the majority of eating is poor and over-priced. Beware of The Rocks around the pubs at night-all too often I fetched by hordes of drunken people on birthday parties, office parties etc. there are a few exceptional restaurants, but if you asked a local where he or she would spend their leisure time, I bet The Rocks wouldn't feature very highly. Flatters to deceive."

But then if you are heading there its almost certainly not because of it's deep western history. Of course, if you're coming to check out the history of Aboriginal culture, you can delve back over 40,000 years! As for western history in Australia, the Rocks is as old as it gets. In the past 20 years, the Rocks has been given a much needed face lift which has also brought increased commercialisation. However, you can still see some of the original Maritime Authority housing - and Stevedores and other harbour workers still live in the area. The real working class past has therefore not been completely sanitised. You can easily spend a day strolling around the main streets, taking in Circular Quay and exploring the back alleyways and hidden staircases. Be prepared for a bit of climbing so keep a bottle of water with you - and there are plenty of watering holes along the way. If you want authentic Australian souvenirs, you will find plenty of choice in the many shops in the area but please check out prices elsewhere. The Sunday market at the end of George Street is well worth a visit. Best to get there early because, on a warm day, it gets pretty busy."

In the 1960s the developers wanted to rip it down and repace it with highrise buildings.Many of the buildings are carved out of Sydney sandstone, or simple wooden workers cottages, built on steep gradients and into cliff-face. A union worker, by the name of Jack Munday realised it was irreplacable Sydney heritage and led a movement that imposed \"green bans\" on its demolition, thus saving it for you to visit today. Although the main drag is full of expensive tourist shops and restaurants swarming with day-trippers, the place still has atmosphere. Once you move out into the narrow streets and laneways, you can really get a feel for Sydney's colonial past.Of note is Susannah's House, with a terrific little museum and friendly staff.Moreover you can still meet genuine locals, showing how the culture has shifted and developed into the Sydney of today. And fabulous exercise negotiating the many steps and climbs.Great views of the underbelly of the Harbour Bridge, as you walk around from Circular Quay too!"

I had done a lot of travel research and knew to wander around The Rocks. We spent a morning enjoying the architecture and bridge views and having a coffee in a French Bistro while waiting to board the ship. Glad we explored this area before we got started on harbor ferries. This was March 14 and when we returned to Sydney for 5 days in April, we spent our last morning in The Rocks before driving to the airport. Lovely to have the old original Sydney so close. A great deal of new construction with a casino and \"6\" star hotel being developed on the other side of The Rocks going into Darling Harbor. Certainly hope it will not take away from the quaintness of this area."

The Rocks district is within a five minute walk if your cruise ship is at the Overseas Passenger Terminal so there is no need to take a taxi to it. It has a variety of (and sometimes overpriced) cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants. The walkways are cobblestone and the streets have some interesting old buildings on them. If you are there on a weekend a trip to the open air market is a must. While there are lots of the usual over-priced souvenirs, there are also some unique crafts people with unusual items for sale e.g. million year old stromatolite fossil bracelets and cut leather jewellery. Residents of Sydney can enjoy festivals and special events all year round, but if you are a tourist I suggest that you check out The Rocks website and see what will be on while you are there - it is worth the visit. And for cruisers - get off the ship - walk up the hill and enjoy this part of Sydney."

During the weekends, there is an outdoor market to buy souvenirs and knick-knacks. Have lunch in the Museum of Contemporary Art while enjoying the views of Sydney Harbour!"

It is the birthplace of European Australia and there are many great restaurants, hotels and pubs. The Rocks weekend markets are a must for all international visitors. One of the best views of Sydney is from the rooftop pool area of the Holiday Inn Old Sydney in George Street.

We are window shoppers, and love looking at the old buildings. Waterfront, too. It's a fairly easy walk and you can just meander without any special athletic ability. This trip, we walked to the tunnel, got a little lost looking for Fish on the Rocks (never did find it) and then wound up enjoying fun shots, real beer, sausages and a salad at the German place. On the way home, we indulged in the very best ice cream cone ever: butterscotch and honey at a place I think was called Royal Copenhagen or something like that. There are also a few bars with live bands playing 80s and 90s material ... Plenty of fun and dancing seemed to be happening. This is a great, cool evening way to enjoy old Sydney ... And it doesn't have to be expensive. Nice alternative to yet another $100 dinner!"

We headed to \"The Australian\" bar. As we got near we could hear a roar, like a football crowd and we realised it was coming from the pub we were going to. The 2-up was in full swing. I'll try and explain it, but if you want to know how to play properly, ask an Australian. The people there were happy to explain it. Basically, a massive crowd gathers round a stage where a volunteer from the crowd flips 2 coins. The crowd has to bet on the outcome. To bet, you have to hold up your money and show if you'd like to choose heads or tails. If someone sees you and wants to bet the opposite then you have a betting partner. The person who wants to choose heads holds the money from both parties and waits for the outcome. It starts off with $5 going up and then the more drinks go down, you start seeing people holding up $50 and $100 notes. I won $5. Re-sult. Boom!"

Then off to the West Pylon of the Harbour Bridge for a view of the harbour. To climb the two hundred stairs to the viewing platform inside the pylon cost $11.00 but as I was already foot sore did not bother as the view form the bridge was spectacular. We were at the rocks on a Friday so had lunch at the Foodies Market -an abundance of choices and very affordable prices. Next visited the Museum of Modern Art Museum (Free Entry). Visited Susannah Place Museum to see how families lived in the Rocks over a hundred year period. What an interesting place - the four terraces have been conserved not renovated so you you really get a sense of what it would have been like to live there. Tour Guides were well informed and passionate about this place. (Cost $8.00) By this time we were very tired and decided to stop and have a drink in some of Sydney's oldest pubs. Stopped at The Harbour Views, and The Glenmore and finished our day at The Argyale. The rocks is a vibrant and interesting palce to visit."

While there is the usual mix of souvenir-type goods in the Market, there were some truly remarkable artisans with higher end offerings. If you're in town on a Sunday when the market is open you may find as we did some jewelry and crafts worth your attention. The Rocks street scene is worth an hour of just people-watching. The array of restaurants, bars and the old architecture offer something for just about everyone.In addition, the Rocks is the gateway to the bridge climb, the marina and quays for ferries around the harbor. We strongly suggest that if you're \"holidaying\" your best bet is to stay at one of the hotels close by the Rocks and the quays. Plenty of dining and bar options up and down the Rocks streets. We made the mistake of staying in the central business district and that is long walk back to the hotel...or...tiresome cab rides that are not cheap and many of the drivers are surly or indifferent."

This is where the city took birth as a colony of settlers in 1788. The original buildings were made mostly of local sandstone, from which the area derives its name according to most. From the earliest history of the settlement, the area had a reputation as a slum, often frequented by visiting sailors and prostitutes. Steeped in history and because it is co close to the Circular Quay and Harbour Bridge, this is a place often visited by tourists. Many trendy curio and souvenir shops and eateries make it a nce place for an evening stroll. Fortune of War and the Lord Nelson are two of the oldest pubs in Sydney and they are here on the rocks!"

This is one of Sydney's older area's and has a quirky range of shops and eating places which all seems to work well together - it's easily accessible via the Circular Quay Station and from here you can also walk past the ferries to the Opera House and Botanic Gardens so for a day out in Sydney, it's an easy and well worthwhile addition."

Apparently this is the historical heart of not just Sydney, but also Australia, and it certainly is a contrast to the the modern high-rise Sydney just behind it and the Circular Quay. We stayed here in the excellent Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel (see my review) and it was the perfect base from which to explore the city. In The Rocks there are many eateries and shops and the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, the Botanical Gardens, the Observatory, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Circular Quay are all very easily accessible from here. The city centre (Hyde Park, Australia Museum, Aquatic Centre etc) is a little further away but still well within walking distance. The market around George and Argyle streets at the weekends is worth visiting and gives a good atmosphere. If you're new to the area you should visit the Visitor Centre (corner of Argyle and Playfair streets) where the staff could not be more friendly and helpful about not only the immediate area but also Sydney in general and beyond. Check out the restaurants for their specials which they have on varying nights for good deals - Sydney is not cheap. Yes it is touristy, but if you're visiting Sydney you've got to do the iconic places like the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge and this is the perfect starting place.A little hint for you. If you want any basic supplies (food, drink, cosmetics etc) do not use the convenience stores in the area which don't even bother to price up their goods and are expensive. Go instead to Woolworth's just off George Street for a decent deal."

Take the time to appreciate the history of the area and then accept that the area is modernizing. There are hidden alleys with stores (art, clothing, etc), pubs, and restaurants throughout the area. The Aboriginal Art store (Spirit Gallery) has a great selection of Aboriginal Art and high-end didgeridoos, and the prices seem competitive for a city centre.There is easy access to the Opera House, the Botanical Garden and the Sydney Harbour Bridge (all worth walks on their own)."

Plan to explore the Sydney Visitor Centre, Dawes Point underneath Harbour Bridge, the workers' terraces on Millers Point, with plenty of historic pubs along the way. The Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel (the oldest built in 1834), the Glenmore Hotel with good harbour views from the rooftop terrace, and the Harbour View Hotel tucked under the Bridge on Lower Fort Street ... the upper lounge offers a great chance to watch those excited bridge climbers as they come and go.

It has lots of shopping and places to eat, but few bargains that we could find. My wife is phsyically limited due to disease, so she found the going hard. We only stayed at most two hours, but that was no one's fault. We had to do that due to the effects of my wife's disabilities and her constant pain when walking. It was sunny and hot. If you go, then wear a hat and use sunscreen. Stay well hydrated. Nonetheless, I do recommend this as a place to visit. It was fun to see the jewelry and other things created by individuals, things to be sold to tourists and others. Do not expect bargains, but the prices listed were not unreasonable. I understand it is a business and they want to make a profit for their efforts and design.Once we left there, we went to nearby Circular Quay and took public trasportation back to the hotel."

During our entire three day visit an enormous cruise ship blocked any view of the Rocks from the Opera House and visa versa. I can't believe Sydney aithorities permit such large ships to come into Circular Quay and destroy the ambiance of the historic core. Unless you are a history buff there is no compelling reason to venture here, particularly during cruise ship docking. this enormously important neighbourhood may be well on its way to exuding the charm of Montego Bay or Key West. A shame."

Our hotel was very nice and there were many options for food and drinks. There is also a lot of history in this area and I would recommend taking the Rocks Walking Tour if you are interested in the history of the neighborhood and how Sydney got its start. There is a great market on the weekends to explore with a wide variety of different items. We felt safe walking around and had no issues while there. Our hotel was close to the Harbour and it seemed there were endless things to do. Check it out while you are there!"

But what I didn't realise was it was one of the oldest areas in Sydney and some of the building actually used to belong to the convicts and setters when they first came to Australia. Two things I highly recommend if you go to the Rocks, don't miss the Saturday markets! We'd gone earlier in the week and went back a second day just because we liked the area do much. Without realising it our second visit was market day and it was fab. The stalls weaved through the streets and had loads of great gift selections. Secondly I really enjoyed the museum there, I think it was called 'the rocks discover museum' or something similar. It only took an hour or do out of our day and gave a fantastic background into The Rocks and its past. It was really nice to walk through the streets afterward once I knew some of its history.Favourite area in Sydney and probably a highlight of my holiday."

There are clothes, hand-made natural soaps, essential oils, candies sauces, opals, pearls and many many interesting items.I love the fashion stores as they are truly beautiful and there's even a store that sell vintage clothing. There are simply gorgeous but be prepared to pay premium price for them. The prices are actually \"boutique-prices\".There's an artist at the end of the Bazaar who spray-paints while he turned on music from famous artists and he'll finish his masterpiece when the song finishes, Bravo!! Best part is...it's not expensive and you sure can afford to buy his masterpieces to bring home.The Rocks are lined with interesting colonial and vintage buildings and it really acts character to the street.The Rocks sure rocks !!!!"

Ok, I realize this is pretty specific, but if you are staying in the harbour or Circular Quay or Rocks area, Wash on the Rocks (clever name) charged only $15.50 for a humongous bag of laundry to be washed, dried & neatly folded. A few extra dollars gets you delivery to your hotel. Bargain, since our hotel charged something like $10 to wash one t-shirt."

Came in on a cruise and had the day on shore so we wondered around Circular Quay. .literally within minutes of off loading the cruise ship we were in the rocks. To see Sydney as it was when it first started is facinating to say the lease when in some back alleys it still had the smells of urine and th elikes. It cannnot be more authentic than that!!!Other than that the shops were well prsented although a bit pricey for souveniers however the food shops were really all VERY reasonablelbe... coffee latte around $3.5 to $4, cakes from $5 and burger at under$10!!!!The best coffe and cake/chocolates was right outside the entrance to the cruise harbour at Gurlaines, but right next door is a French pastry shop , It was about 20% cheaper and had some great savories and desserts too!! Being a diabetic this was my call and we had morning tea at Gurlaines and Afternonn tea next door!!! Service was much better at Gurlaines but you pay for it. The french pastry shop was typically french service standards... a bit snobby!!!. But you don't pay for it!!!!Walking the cobble stone lanes and taking the bike tour was just perfect for our day out in the rocks but just a stone throw away at the other end of the harbour cove is the Sydney Opera house. We walked there and in the summer heat still very bearable with the sea breeze. We spend a bit of time there and it was well worth the extra distance we walked!!! The Sydney opera house may sound old fashion but is a truly manificient building and shape!!! Another must do for vissiting Sydney. A bit further on is the botanicall gardens. It looked really interesting but as time was pressing we did not venture on . We wanted to get up close and personal with the sydney Harbour Bridge.so off we went back to the other aside of the cove and past the rocks area. We were only 8 minute walk from the cruise ship and when we got underneath the bridge it was AWESOME, such large bolts and nuts to hold it all together. A giant meccano set. We went on to the bridge to see more and could have walked across the brides but chose not to as we were due back to the ship soon. But we did walk around the park where the old obeseavatory was . Well worth it as it was pleasant and seem like the natives both white and coloured Australians have a close afinity as there were people relaxing on the greens every where. Sooo pleasant and peacefull with the rumble of traffic crossing the harbour bridgeFor photo oppurtunist, the view from the bridge across to the water is great seeing the cove and opera house. From the opera house th eview is just as good seeing the harbour bridge."

It also has real significance to the Aboriginal owners, so its a great location to visit. Go on the weekend to enjoy the markets. Good quality and resonably priced items to take home for family or enjoy. No tacky souveniers. Also on the weekend there live bands and good music supported by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority. Lots of good places to eat and some market stall food as well. Take a tour around the area for more historical information. The Rocks is the cultural heart of Sydney.

There were many little side streets, all of significant historical interest, with numerous plaques on walls or footpaths pointing these out. There were also many tourist shops, some of which sold items that were certainly not the everyday tourist souvenirs that you expect to find. It's worth the time to look around as you often find the most amazing little shops run by helpful, enthusiastic shopkeepers and their staff.

There's an Irish pub there and they had live music but the price of beer is so high that you might want to hang around outside to listen to the music. The Rocks as an area is much bigger than I expected and many of the buildings are difficult to identify. In reality it's probably one of those places that you need to go to because you can't go to Sydney and not go to The Rocks, but I wouldn't bother to spend much time there."

However it has been progressively commercialised and tourist-oriented, so that the historic character has been largely subsumed into just another tourist trap. Moreover on some nights, the drunks and other antisocial types start running amok, so there may be a spectator sport of watching police deal with the idiots but it's not a recommended environment. Its proximity to Circular Quay, the harbour bridge and the CBD make it a natural part of tourist movement, but you'll need to visualise what it once was rather than admiring its present status."

There's a good mix of everything, from excellent street performances, to good food outlets, and not forgetting the unique shopping experience. However, one thing to note for bargain hunters: selling price of souvenirs, which may be readily available in other parts of Sydney, are higher. So if you wanna get those tourists souvenirs, it'll be best to get them in places like, say, Paddy's Market in Chinatown."

If you find yourself there, walk along by the water to the Quay and on to the Botannic Gardens."

She was, however, very cheerful and friendly, providing maps and such. The parts of The Rocks we saw looked a little trashy, and I don't recommend straying far from the main areas."

Have lived in Sydney for over 30 years and despite having walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge many, many times, I have never ventured into the Observatory Hill precinct. Alighting the train at Milsons Point and walking across the bridge is without a doubt a MUST DO for all visitors to Sydney for our harbour is something superb that one never tires of. But when you get to the south side, instead of veering left onto the Opera House side, follow the signs to Observatory Hill and you are in for a sightseeing gem of the bridge. The park has great space for kids to run around in and there is a little play equipment. During school holidays there are children's activities at the Observatory but you need to book. We walked down to look over Barangaroo and down to The Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel where we had a refreshing drink. It was lovely. The restaurant looks appealing too. The bathrooms were up the stairs and impeccably maintained. Coming down the stairs the walls are filled with historic mariner items but what took my eye was First Fleeters names and we found our relatives, so made us feel really chuffed. We walked through to the Rocks enjoying all the little narrow streets and terraces that are being done up. The Rocks on Fridays was a gastrointestinal extravaganza. The information centre in Argyle Street had some great and reasonably priced gifts. We found Sydney Symphony opposite in the Clocktower and bought tickets and then walked up to St. Patricks Catholic Church Hill and went to mass. A wonderful day right in our own backyard. Just a note of warning, there is a lovely outdoor seating area behind the information centre but the seagulls are OVERLY FAMILIAR and will take your food before you blink, especially if you have sushi! Enjoy the ambience of the old Sydney."

Don't be deterred by the \"tourist trap\" reputation - there are tons of things to do for free in the Rocks, including (1) Museum of Contemprary Art plus tens of smaller private galleries (2) harbourside walks, (3) historic building walks, (4) weekend markets and (5) a great park under the harbour bridge with fantastic views. Culture Vultures will find Sydney Theatre Company and Dance Company housed on Hickson Road to the West of the Rocks. Drinkers and foodies have a huge range of options. Check out the Argyle Centre which has a huge pub in a restored warehouse with a cobblestoned central courtyard. Have a picnic on conservatory hill for more wonderful views. Take 10 mins at the Tourism Info Centre to find out what is happening because there are always great things on like the coffee festival, Latin American Festival plus a lot more."

The Rocks is conveniently nestled between Sydneys' two icons, the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge so you don't have to go far to take the both of them in. The Circle Quay is right there too should you wish to take a ferry ride to some other place on the harbour or just a lunch cruise on the water. If you want to expand your sightseeing, hop on a double decker bus that will take you around Sydney as many times as you want.

Remnants of homes, built from rock hewn on site by men and carted by horse, with some artefacts.......Life was tough back then......Then enjoy a beverage at one of the many hotels in the area, that have also kept the charm of their particular era. I love The Rocks, and visit it every time I venture to Sydney and always find something new to look at."

We stayed at the Holiday Inn at the Rocks and it was perfect, just a very short walk from the harbor bridge, the opera house and all of the ferries. The opera house is the perfect place to watch all of the sunrises you'll be awake for when you first get there. Also a 24 hr pancake house just around the corner, also for those early mornings when you'll be awake. There are plenty of shops and restaurants very close by."

Everything is extreamly overpriced (but i guess everything in Sydney is) and the only cheap things in sight are sold by Asian stalls, which are very tacky and not worth the money! The nightlife is great, but it is very touristy, sometimes it seemed as if i were in chinatown. And some of the stall owners get very rude if you refuse to buy anything and just want to look.There is a great pub almost directly under the bridge that gave out decent sized meals and had a great atomosphere. Reccomened to all :)"

There are so many shops and such variety right from jewellery, dresses, funny t shirts... Actually every week you may find new stuff. Then there is street side food vendors , its fun trying their stuff. You have to try mango beer. There is a quaint Irish tea shop where you get home made scones and jams. My fav is fig and ginger jam. Love the feel of walking on the cobbled streets, surrounded by old building .... Makes one feel as if we are in a different era. If you take a walk you get great view of both harbour bridge and opera house. If you are feeling down go to The Rocks and you will feel happy!!"

The first people we 'met' were still out drinking from the night before and we had trouble shaking them off. We finally found somewhere serving sit-down breakfast, but spent 40 minutes waiting for it. We managed, but some of the other customers were getting pretty tetchy. The shops were not especially enticing - most catering to cashed-up international tourists. The area itself is worth visiting for anyone interested in the history of the area, but more could be done to make the historical sites interesting and informative. I think I would have enjoyed all this more if I hadn't spent a long lifetime hearing that the Rocks in Sydney was a 'must see'. As a pleasant place to walk on a sunny morning - it's perfectly fine."

They have cleverly incorporated these exposed ruins into the building housing the YHA which floats above them. The foundations of numerous homes from the turn of the twentieth century have been preserved and are on display with boards giving details of the people who lived in them and a history of the area.

Though, we did have an amazing lunch from one of the street vendors - I'm still dreaming of my roasted pumpkin with feta and walnut pesto wrap I had there. Lunch prices from the vendors were very reasonable - so I'd definitely recommend it. After lunch we toured the small history museum there - I'm drawing a blank on the name, but I definitely think it is worth a visit."

The Rocks is the old part of Sydney, full of colonial sandstone architecture, hidden winding lanes with names that reveal their original purpose.These days this location has been sexyed up for tourism activities, like restaurants, coffee shops and souvenier shops. This is also where there is a regular weekend Market. The goods on offer are high quality and interesting. The busking is usually of a high standard: I listened to a student opera singer and a quite good pop singer, complete with amplification. The restaurants are a little formulaic and are hell bent on churning those covers through. They are staffed usually by eager young backpackers from all over the world, which makes it interesting. The Rocks seems to be on several levels, literally, so it affords an interesting walking tour. Being right on the Harbour waterfront gives you easy access to other parts of Sydney's harbourside suburbs and attractions, as well as access to the CBD. The Rocks is a Must-Do destination when you visit Sydney. And if you sit quietly while you are having that relaxing coffee as the sun sinks to the West, you may catch a glimpse of some of Old Sydney Town's resident ghost population as they dart between the shadows of some of those old cobblestone lanes."

The Rocks, on the southern shore of Sydney\u2019s inner harbour, is the place where the city began, established in 1788 after the colony\u2019s formation. Convicts, colonialists, sailors, hookers, and all manner of disreputable and dubious characters lived in this quarter and many of the old sandstone buildings, after which it\u2019s named, from that era have been fixed up as hotels, pubs, restaurants, and shops, as well as galleries for local art. We wandered through the narrow cobblestone streets, following the Nurses and Surgeons Walk, and spent some time in the Rocks Museum looking at the artifacts taken from the old houses. A small section of the museum provided material for creating one\u2019s own display and so my partner left behind a classic British Columbian memento, an inukshuk out of stones. Several plaques along the way give information about the history of the buildings.We also tried some vertical planking in interaction with the local art works. The colonial buildings here have been beautifully restored and many have been converted into art galleries and craft shops. One harbourside building, a three story structure formerly used as a sailors\u2019 dorm, is now a gallery featuring the work of Sydney artist Charles Billich; the building is fabulous. There are many restaurants and pubs and the area is close to the Harbour and the Observatory.

To fill in some time on the morning after checkout my boyfriend and I headed down to The Rocks, only a short stroll from our hotel on Jameson Street. We had breakfast at Pancakes on the Rocks and it was delicious! After than we went looking through the adjacent stores and bought a few items at the Candle Factory - so many gorgeous things to choose from! Then we headed out into the infamous Rocks Markets and bought a funky floor lamp, a framed original film cell and an artwork from from Darren Germain, the artist who does his spray paint art live in from of the crowds - he is amazing!!! I also boughta cute vintage style dress from one of the vendors there. My tip is to go with plenty of cash! We were there early and were the first sale of the day for the floor lamp vendor and as we were paying by EFTPOS we had to come back in 10 minutes after he had set up his machine. Also, some vendors don't take card - we ended up finding some cash in our wallets/pockets to pay for our spray paint artwork - otherwise he would have had to do the transaction through his friend the Glassblower. So they do have systems in place to take card but it's a bit of effort!! I really wanted some hot corn on the cob and some chocolate dipped strawberries and some caramel peanuts.... but we didn't have any cash! Oh well, I didn't really need them....."

My wife and I have enjoyed heaps of Saturday afternoons just sitting with a cold drink from one of the many cafes and enjoying the nice views of the harbour and the bridge. At night it can get a bit annoying with the clubbers and pub-crawlers coming out and getting pissed but if your into that then this is another good (albiet pricey) spot to hit up.

I have to say that I thought the contemporary art was a joke - one of which was just confetti scattered on the floor and window sill.A bit more surreal is the Ken Done Art Gallery just up the road. It's colourful and very popular but if you want to buy any, arrange the bank loan before you go.Best of all is just sitting in the small park at the entrance to the Rocks looking out over Circular Quay and drinking in the atmosphere."

It is also a vibrant hub of the city with plenty of retail outlets, eating and drinking establishments and the arts. It is wonderfully located in relation to some of Sydneys icons like the Opera House, Harbour Bridge and the gallery of Contemporary Art. It is also readily accessible by public transport be it by bus, train or water. Sundays in The Rocks are particularly interesting with street stalls and often, street theatre. Despite having some more expensive eating places it is also able to offer very inexpensive and good dining experiences.

On Sunday, the Market in the Rocks is not to be missed. Enjoyed the roasted corn on a stick while browsing the booths. I particularly enjoyed the man from The Licorice Shop. He is in a stall just outside the main area and insists on serving samples of all of the different types of licorice he sells. Absolutely lovely to talk to and enjoyed his delicious treats. Bought several containers as gifts as Australian licorice is known to be the best.Also, while in the Rocks, I strongly suggest you go to the Museum of Contemporary Art. The exhibits are varied and interesting. There is no admittance fee to the museum. While there, go upstairs for lunch. The restaurant on the top floor overlooks all of Sydney Harbour - not to be missed!"

The buildings and tiny alleyways reflect the early history of Sydney, and the range of eateries means that you are sure to find something that pleases the mood. The markets on sundays are a great place to find goodies and trinkets or good quality items to take home."

Simply walking through the many streets and seeing some of the older buildings is really worth the effort. Many of the buildings were constructed out of local sandstone and the name 'The Rocks' became the endearing term for this area. You will want to visit Cadman's Cottage (a sandstone structure that was built in 1815-16 as the \u2018Coxswain\u2019s Barracks\u2019 ); Campbell's Warehouse or Stores (the only surviving warehouse of their type at Sydney Cove) and the Lord Nelson. These are just a few of the many fine buildings. Allow at least a minimum of a a half day so that you can leisurely walk around this historic area and feel the history. Don't forget to try an ale or two at the many fine hotels."

If you prefer alchohol with your food, try the german restaurant/beer garden. Check out the Nurses Walk, little speciality shops there like the button shop. If you walk behind the pub in the middle of the Rocks market, you can see the remains of the old houses that used to be there, check out how small they were. Keep walking up the stairs,turn left, go past the pub, cross the road and you will eventually reach the harbour bridge entrance just to the right of the zebra crossing. Enjoy......"

Really efficient and easy to use. I gotta say however that the level of service provided in Australia is consistently poor. More about flogging you stuff you don't need and what they have handy rather than staff listening to what you want. Wanted to buy some specific fragrances from a number of high end outlets and they didn't have what I wanted, could direct me to where I might get what I wanted, no product knowledge about what they had and kept on about 'do I want fries with that' approach. We really need to do better if these edifices are to survive in their current form and compete with online. Eventually got what I wanted online.I discovered that The Rocks is mainly owned by NSW Govt Social Housing. This was inetresting given the views and other advantages. Overall a good experience."

At the Harbour end of the Rocks, check out the new Gallery of Contemporary Art. Fascinating exhibitions - depending on your taste.

Begin your day wandering through the various market areas - everything is available there and it is the perfect place to buy top quality souvenirs. If you haven't found what you want at the markets, wander onto adjoining George Street where there is any number of quality buying opportunities. Shopping done, cross George street and spend a couple of hours in the Museum of Contemporary Art - the new extension looks amazing and due to open any day now. Perhaps have lunch at the excellent cafe there, outside, overlooking the harbour. Sit for a while and watch the never ending stream of ferries coming and going from Circular Quay. You can listen to the live didgeridoo music played by various Aboriginal folk. From there, stroll around the foreshore to the Opera House. Spend some time both inside and outside and take in the glorious view of the harbour. Continue on from the Opera House and walk into the Botanical Gardens. There is so much to see there, including the ancient Wollemi Pine tree, the extensive herb garden, and Government House. Again, sit for a while under the shade - maybe indulge in some afternoon tea at the kiosk there. Revived - then trace your steps back past the Opera House, around the foreshore, past Circular Quay and keep on going. Shortly you will find yourself looking up at the beautiful Sydney Harbour Bridge. You may want to come back a little later for dinner at one of the many excellent restaurants housed in the Old Wool Sheds right there. If you feel like wandering a little more inland, look out for the Lord Nelson Hotel - its a small pub, supposedly the oldest in Australia, and indulge in any one of the excellent wines or beers on offer. And if you're not too tired - why not see whats on at the Opera House that night - the view of the bridge, and Luna Park over the water, is quite stunning at night. So, you've 'almost' seen it all, only thing missing is one of the many beautiful beaches in Sydney - you'll have to come back for another day!"

It gets its name because most of the buildings are built of stone. The Rocks is the oldest area of Sydney. It has been transformed into a major attraction by converting warehouses and very old buildings into restaurants, trendy shopping, a class outdoor market area (weekends mostly). The effect is clearly old world charm. There are numerous restaurants here and check Trip Advisor for reviews. We liked restaurants in the alley way behind the major street running along the harbour. Quiet, with outdoor dining or inside depending on your wishes.The Rocks is the oldest area of Sydney and has recently undergone an amazing metamorphosis, the old district being transformed into a vibrant pocket of cafes and restaurants and interesting tourist shops and stalls. This has been achieved without destroying the area's Old World charm and historic buildings. Sydney's town planners have put in place a sensitive conservation program that has preserved the heritage and character of The Rocks and brought about an interesting fusion of modern amenities in an old and valued setting."

We were lucky enough to spend St Pat's Day on The Rocks where pubs were offering \"cooked breakfast and bottomless Guinness\". The whole area was a sea of green with people in hats, t-shirts, flags and even guys in kilts. We spent the afternoon in a pub called \"The Orient\" and were royally entertained by a very energetic Irish band. In the pub were young and old, singing along to \"Wild Rover\", \"Danny Boy\" and other such well known Irish tunes. I found it impossible not to tap my feet and at times had to restrain myself from breaking into a full jig. It was wonderful to share the experience with other fun-loving folk who were clearly having the time of their lives.

These shops, up steps across the road from the back of the harbourside buildings, had a wide range of goods at prices much less than in central Sydney, and the service was fantastic. Its worth exploring the whole Rocks area - very interesting."

The market is full of very interesting stalls, everything from wind chimes, glass blowers, ceramics, essential oils, foodstuffs - one could easily spend 2/3 hours here. Plenty of cafes and places to sit out and enjoy the atmosphere. Make the effort to go a few streets away from the market to get a non touristy and more atmospheric feel."

There are lots of signs around the area telling bits of its history. The Rocks Experience and Susannah Place more thoroughly explain the history of the area. The \"Big Dig\" is an archaeological excavation that hs been kept open for viewing. The youth hostel constructed their building on stilts in order to preserve the old foundations rather than just build on top of them. If you're not into history and historic preservation, go for the weekend market and the variety of restaurants. Just go there and wander!"

Markets on the weekends or outdoor seating in some areas for drinks with friends or relaxing from your touring. Shops abound the streets from touristy kitsch to current artist gallery.Time required - Depending on how many shops you wander into but a walk through the Rocks can take one hour or a whole afternoon. Services - There are many bars and eateries here that warrant a visit. It could be the \"Fortune of War\" bar est. 1828 and is the whole in the wall come as you are kind of place or Rockpool, one of the higher rated places in Sydney to eat and showing up without reservations is extremely ill-advised. Grab a pint at Lord Admiral Nelsons brewery and visit the more unknown views at Observatory hill for scenery of the Rocks and the harbor.Day or night this section of Sydney warrants a visit.There are several statues in around the walk and the Contemporary Museum of Art is located here.

The Rocks area of Sydney is the oldest historic architecture - 18th and 19th century buildings. There's a buzzy atmosphere at weekends with a market, there are old warehouses that have been turned into shops, the pubs are cool, there are some decent restaurants at the overseas passenger terminal and one 3 hat restaurant called Quay which is utterly superb but you need to book in about 6 months ahead and it is NOT cheap.

At the feet of some hotel skyscrapers (such as the Shangry La hotel), you will find this ancient district, which gives you a warm welcome into the old England dating back to Victorian times.All those red-bricks houses transport you back in time. It is really nice to see the characteristic market with any kind of souvenirs and typical food. Strolling down the road you will be soon at the harbour and you can decide to take a ferry or to go in Geroge's street which is instead very modern with high buildings and modern shops.I think that the Rocks is a good starter point to visit Sydney."

Before all the cruise ships started docking adjacent to The Rocks, it felt more authentic. Now, there's the usual spate of shops that cater to cruisers and the crowds when ships are in make it unpleasant. I wish they had kept more of the original buildings - maintained them - because the character there 20 years ago is not there today. Here, this was the birthplace of Sydney and it would be nicer if it were really kept as an architecturally accurate representation, as much as possible, to those olden days. It is fun though to walk through the cobblestone streets (some are not now) and to visit the outdoor markets. My husband and I stayed at The Russell Hotel years ago, and I must say that this building has maintained it's old world charm. they still use room keys and you turn them in when leaving the hotel....the rooms are charming, antiquated and so what you would hope for an area like The Rocks."

The Rocks has it all - varied history ( from the original settlers and First Fleet, to the housing for the bridge constructors, and 'entertainment' for visiting sailors in all ages), Great hotels, and every manor of food and pub. I particularly enjoyed the open market held the weekend I was there (mid Nov). Most of my meals on the go were enjoyed from the street vendors or pubs along the narrow streets.At night, the party was fantastic. From dj's getting the crowd moving to live acts whipping the faithful into a rock-n-roll frenzy. While all good, I recommend the Orient Hotel and Pub. Good two-man band and friendly crowd made for a memorable Saturday night. And the crowd was right-aged for this traveler (30's-40's set). Sure there were plenty of places for the kids, but wasn't looking for that.Next time, I will try to stay at the Four Seasons located in the thick of the Rocks district. Easier walking distance after a night of sampling the local brews and dancing too much!"

One of the attractions is the Rocks Market which is held on Saturdays and Sundays. A roadway is closed to traffic, the canvas coverings are strung up and the markets open to offer many interesting goods to the shopper. There are original artworks and prints, jewelry, gourmet foods, dresses, leather work etc.The location of the markets in an historic area together with the range of goods on offer, gives this market a great feel.

It is rather touristic but not as tacky as some places can be and the sense of history is all-pervasive.

            "review": "Historical wonderland. My boyfriend surprised me with a 4 night trip staying in The Rocks. I have never felt a desire to visit Sydney and touristy places are not regarded very highly by either of us, so when he told me where we were going I was a bit dubious that we could fill 4 nights happily. I was to be proven very wrong.I guess you could do The Rocks on a day tour and later talk about the old buildings, cobblestone walkways and sandstone blockwork, but we decided that we wanted to really discover The Rocks, learn as much history as we can and not even venture out of the area much at all and that's what we did.We filled all of those days and learnt so much, visited so many pubs (3 at least say that they are the oldest), read so many plaques, walked so many miles, ventured down laneways and discovered hidden gems, met wonderful people and did a couple of tours. We were not impressed by the touristy markets that are set up on weekends, but that's just not our thing, but there is so much else to see, do and experience. We did the Rocks Ghost Tour and and a laughing good time, learnt a lot of history, then put our free drinks vouchers to good use.We also visited Suzannah Place Museum and our guide Annie was a fabulous character. On the surface it's just a few old buildings, but the stories that go along with those old homes are priceless.If you want to really discover what The Rocks is all about I suggest a good pair of walking shoes and a fair bit of time and patience to get a bit lost and stop to read all the bits of information that pop up in front of you here and there.We loved it all and will return later in the year."

Not a large area to cover.\u00a0 The city's best tourist info center is here.\u00a0\u00a0 Go for breakfast and tour the area and its history.\u00a0 On weekends there's a small street market.\u00a0 At night, there are more pubs than restaurants, but if looking for a good restaurant, go to the Waterfront restaurant by the Park Hyatt facing the Opera House - incredible views and pretty decent food, but pricey.\u00a0 The views at night by the Park Hyatt are stupendous."

            "review": "The Rocks Pub Tour. This was the very first thing I did in Sydney and I highly recommend it! I was travelling by myself and it was a great first way to be exposed to Sydney, meet people, and learn to navigate your way through The Rocks. I booked my tour online for $35. The downside of this was that it said it started at 5pm and it actually started at 6pm, which I wouldn't have found out had the Visitors center at the Rocks been so helpful. It begins at Cadmans Cottage the the tour guide gives you historical information about The Rocks and Sydney in general throughout the tour. There are many opportunities for photo ops, especially by the observatory at sunset. You get to visit 3 different pubs and get a drink at each one. They are supposed to be the half pints, but two of the pubs ended up giving us full pints. We visited the Australian, Lord Nelson Brewery, and Harbor View Hotel, although they differ every tour. Our tour guide, Vic, was awesome. He was full of information, funny, friendly, and personable. At the end of the tour, he gave us 2 for 1 coupons to use at Harbour View Hotel and didn't put a date on them so you could use them whenever you wanted. He also gave us recommendations as to where to eat, which was really helpful. I ended up meeting people I hung out with all night and ended up frequenting two of the bars we visited throughout my trip to Sydney. For $35 you can't get a better deal and have a better first night in Sydney. highly recommended!"

I loved the morning tea and bevvy with my co-riders. We did so many icons in just a few hours - I am going on The Rocks Pub Tour too so I am really looking forward to that as it is run by the same team :-)"

            "review": "The Rocks Pub Tour. When visiting Sydney a good way to tour The Rocks is through the walking Pub Tour. You can book the Pub Tour or any other tours through the visitor center locations. We did ours online in advance to reserve our spot. The Pub Tour last two hours and each tour has a different guide and different pubs to visit. The tour guide drank with us and knew all the bartenders which came in handy on this venture. She was knowledgeable about the history of the pubs and some stops along the way. She was able to take a group of strangers from all over the world and have us exchanging emails by the end of the night. We all ended up hanging out at the last bar buying each other rounds at one of the oldest pubs in Sydney. Cheers mate, no worries!"

            "review": "Take time to explore the hidden gems!. When you are in Sydney, you have to visit the Rocks. Visit the Discovery Museum on Argyle Street. It's free, and very informative. The interactive displays are really cool. Take the time to read them. Donations are appreciated (or so the guy at the front desk said), and after the day I spent there, they really deserved it.After you leave the Museum, explore a little. Wander around the alleyways and narrow back streets--I highly recommend the Suez Canal street. it looks like a really narrow alley, almost like it is just a way for water to drain (by the way, if its raining very hard, I don't recommend it). There's a pretty cool display that I never would have expeced to find. I just happened to stumble upon it.Cadman's Cottage was built in 1816, and is worth a look. It doesn't take long, but it is interesting inside, with a few small displays and information about excavating the old buildings in the area.There are plenty of shops, both touristy and upper-end fashion shops. You can find some really cool things here. One shop that is a must-see is The Puppet Shop at the Rocks. It is downstairs from the Chamber of Commerce, right off George St. It is amazing! The owner makes many of the puppets by hand, and the prices for the puppets are not bad at all! It is truly an amazing and magical experience.Next, take time to walk across the Harbour Bridge and back. It will take about an hour, but it is an amazing experience. The views are spectacular, and its free. Stop at the first pylon and climb to the top for a great photo op. That costs about $10AUD, and is well worth the effort (there aren't too many steps, they aren't steep, and there are a few benches along the way). You can also climb the bridge, but that costs over $200, and you can't take a camera with you. I hear the views are amazing, but I prefer to be able to take pictures and save money. Whatever you want, though.Enjoy a nice dinner at any of the restaurants in the Rocks. Most of them have indoor and outdoor seating, and are located in beautiful old sandstone buildings. Phillip's Foote and the G'Day Cafe are good finds.Finally, get a drink at one of the many old bars in the Rocks. Some of them are truly old, with liquor licenses going back to the mid 1800s in many cases. End your evening with a night stroll along Circular Quay, or a ferry ride to Darling Harbour, to enjoy the lights of the city (and the Opera House and Bridge) on the water."

            "review": "The Rocks - great museum. \u201cThe Rocks\u201d is the peninsula to the left (north) of Circular Quay (pronounced \u201ckey\u201d) in Sydney. An excellent museum (free, but we gladly made a donation) was small but very well done. The hour we spent there went too quickly. Back in the days when convicts still did most of the manual labor, a bunch of them spend a few years digging through the rock down the middle of the peninsula so that it would be easier to get from one side to the other. Having the story of its creation in mind makes the \u201cArgyle Cut\u201d is interesting to walk through. At the Quay (south) side of the cut we were intrigued by a passage between two old warehouses (or some other type of ancient brick buildings) where something seemed to be going on. A sign and a menu said \u201cThe Argyle\u201d and we walked between the buildings to find a huge cobblestone courtyard in the triangle formed with a third old building. In the center of the triangle was a large bar surrounded by many tables. It was cool on this September evening (think of it like March if you live around 40 degrees north of the equator) and people were carrying out and lighting gas heaters on proverbial \u201cten foot poles\u201d with reflectors above the flames to direct the heat downwards."

There are tours of the area and other activities accessible from the Info Center, which had one of the best shops in town surprisingly. Make sure you are there at night whan it's at it's best."

If you want touristy souveniers or some truely wonderful memories of sydney these are the markets, they are run on weekends during summer (maybe other months too) and are almost right under the harbour bridge.the rocks in general are a wonderful place to get lost in, lots of small laneways with cobblestones and ssandstone walls.there are some great places for kids - a puppet shop that holds a puppet show during the day, although it is difficult to find.the rocks are next to circular quay so you can see a few attractions in the one day, but not spend your time running around. Avoid the foodcourt and stop into one of the surrounding cafes with courtyards that mean you can avoid the crowds."
