It is a Romanesque Revival building designed by George McRae and is located in downtown Sydney and is a city block in size. It was originally a marketplace but also had additional uses. After suffering years of decay, it underwent remodeling and restoration and is now home to designer boutiques and upscale restaurants. You should walk through it just to observe the fantastic tile work on its floors and the fabulous stained glass windows. The center cupola is totally \"off the wall\" as is the clock. You have to see it to believe it. This is a worthwhile activity to partake of."

The only complaint is that it was very crowded the day we were there, and the physical layout really makes you feel the crowds."

There are also several little cafes located throughout where you can grab a bite or drink. Some were all enclosed establishments others were tables situated in the walkways. The entire middle of building is open so you can look up/down on the other levels. Escalators at ends of levels and believe there are elevators in the middle. The building is a full city block long. Beautiful architecture. There is a huge clock in the middle between levels which has little ships/boats that move around the clock as minutes tick by that is enjoyed by young an old."

Having just arrived from visiting Melbourne where we enjoyed the Queen Victoria Market with its 600 vendors hawking a wide array of goods and foods in a spirited environment, we were anxious to see how the QVB compared. What we found were high end shops in an interior, 3 story, covered block long mall. It wasn't our style - and most of the shops were closed when we walked through in the early evening.The building was of architectural interest, but a quick walk through sufficed for us."

The exterior is a great example of Sydney sandstone. The shops are top quality and the overall atmosphere is delightful and busy without being too crowded. The clock in the centre is an interesting feature, and there are several cafes in the building and nearby. At Christmas time, a very tall Christmas tree decorated with crystal ornaments is installed."

I returned to Royal Leamington Spa, UK where a similar building had just been completed, supposedly inspired by the QVB. The British architect got nowhere near the brilliance of the QVB. Note: the 'When did you travel?' choice does not allow truth to emerge; redesign."

This is a very attractive building set in the heart of Sydney and worth a visit just for the architecture. The store is on a similar line to Harrods of London but to me is more impressive The place is full of high end stores and plenty of cafes and restaurants. The clocks hanging from the ceiling are beautiful as is the stain glass windows and dome The tiles on two floors are laid in the mosaic style and are most impressive. Overall, I wouldn't go there for high end shopping bot for the building itself which is a treasure and is well maintained"

I had always admired the jewelry shop Swarovski so we went in for a look. Well we had the biggest pretty woman experience. YES we were snubbed and no i did not purchase anything from there. These girls looked down their noses at us. We got a hello from 2 people and that was it. So the head office got a nice complaint email last night. If you want good service go to lovisa as they are a lot more friendly."

It's fairly typical upscale shopping mall inside, but a couple of things make it irresistible. First of all, the building. It's named Queen Victoria Building for a reason. It's absolutely stunning. Second, it's the location. A lot of tourist routes pass by this building, so most of the tourists are going to see it. And, remember, it's irresistible :) Once you get inside - be prepared to blow your budget. Most of the brands are fairly typical, but they service is excellent and the presentation is great."

This building is more than a commercial area where you can shop, it's a piece of art, you feel like you're transported into another century, not your ordinary shopping mall, it's refreshing and not as packed and crammed as european shopping centers. It has luxurious boutiques as well as restaurants. They offer free wifi and everytime you come back to visit it will tell you how long it's been. There are benches here and there, if you'd like to seat and rest inbetween. Definitely worth the visit!"

Praise should go to those people who maintain these clocks in such a wonderful working order, thank you.

The waitress was very friendly and willing to share information about the coffee and produce. Being a lot quieter this experience was relaxing and the service was prompt. I do not hesitate in recommending this cafe."

By the end of the 20th century it had fallen into disrepair and at one time there were plans to demolish it. However it was restored between 1984 and 1986 at a cost of $86m. It now houses mostly high end shops as well as restaurants and caf\u00e9s. A feature of the building is its original tilework, and the modern replacement tiles are in keeping with the original style. A further $48m refurbishment took place between 2008 and 2009.Well worth a visit."

There have been some changes since I last visited, there are glass and steel handrails, some modern stairs and escalators including one that is suspended from the third to second levels that might be a challenge for those suffering vertigo. A great place for shopping where you can have a meal, put together a complete outfit from head to toe with underwear, shoes and jewellery.

The range of shops provide mostly higher end goods, but good pricing is also available. Food outlets are plentiful and food is of good quality. Especially if you have children plan your visit to include the passing of an hour i.e. 10:00 am or 11:00 am etc and get close to the hanging clock on the top floor. On the hour, it's 'chimes' are quite entertaining."

Be sure to visit on the hour, every hour (is 9AM, 10AM etc etc through the day and into the night) because each hour the main clock (go up to the top floor) puts on its display of \"6 famous scenes of English History\". There are great cafes, and a lovely \"Tea Room\" if you like drinking tea and having cakes and scones, English Style. Also take a look at the historic photos that are on display in the stair wells. This building was derelict for many years and was slated for demolition in the 1970s. It was only through a group of activists that the building was saved and totally renovated in the 1980s. Stand back opposite the Sydney Town Hall and you get a great view of the outside architecture. Truly a gem."

The Queen Victoria Building (QVB) is a Historical Building in the middle of Sydney's Central Business District (CBD) and is a hub of activity as I shall explain in this review.If you like cafes, there are many of those, both indoors and outdoors.For shopping, you will find bargains in Victoria's Basement downstairs from the lower level.On other levels you will find health foods, pharmacies, high end fashion boutiques, jewelry, novelty items and of course, more cafes.I mentioned before that the Queen Victoria Building is a HUB of Activity. Let me now explain why.You can exit Town Hall underground station at the QVB end and in a few steps you at the lower ground level of the QVB.There are throngs of hurried people heading towards the station after finishing work and it can be quite an art to navigate through if you are heading in the opposite direction, which I usually am. You see, I come from home into the city to attend meetings held after office hours,This is a great time if you want to grab a packed meal at half price because shopkeepers are clearing unsold stock before closing their shops.As you exit the station there are two ways you can go, as well as upwards to street level. You can keep going straight ahead, in this case you are in the QVB.If you branch off to the right, you end up in Victoria Galleries, which could become the topic for another review.However, when you are in QVB, there is shopping and cafes on three levels. The lower level leads through to Myers and a large food court. The street level leads to York Street on one side, from which a number of Bus Routes can be accessed, and to George Street on the other side, which will soon access the Light Rail.The very top floor of QVB consists of professional suites plus banquet rooms and function halls that can be hired for occasions.The Queen Victoria Building is a popular place with overseas visitors because it combines the charm of the era with up to date shopping facilities."

Tall ceilings with vaults and classic architecture with ornate staircases and glass windows will blow you away. Make sure you have a cheeky look at how the escalators were installed retrospectively to the building! They are suspended off the giant trusses above. Interesting!For tourists this place is a must! Browse through the boutique (and fairly expensive) fashion and jewelry stores or grab a pastry at any number of cafes on each level. QVB also hosts a really neat spot to take your kids... a hobby shop that boasts planes, trains and automobiles, and anything that involves your hands and brain."

The Hobbyco shop on the top floor southern end, is well stocked and proves to be a hit with families on school holidays. Every floor has restaurants and cafes which fill to the brim at lunchtime. The upper floor shops have expensive merchandise and are really worth a browse. In the lowest floor there is a Victoria's Basement shop for crockery and cutlery. There are lots of ladies and men's clothing stores and other shops selling art, posters, model soldiers, jewellery, cuddly toys, bread, nuts, take away food. Something for everyone here. The QVB is a hop step and jump from Town Hall Railway Station, so it is really easy to find on Sydney's main street called George Street. And it is a great place to visit on a wet day, as you can get to it in an underground walkway form the railway station."

I'd actually stumbled upon this building by accident, I was looking for a cinema but ended up finding the entrance to the QVB. I expected a few shops, I didn't expect 3 floors of every type of shop you could imagine.And it just keeps going, and going and going.....I felt like I would come above ground in Melbourne such was the length of the it.

With 2 basement and 3 top levels, QVB is a good place for you to check international brands as well as local art. You can find a nice range of mid-price brands such as Camper, Fossil and Country Road. If you have more budget, then you can just pop into the higher end shops like Bally, Longchamp and Coach. We were there in early Jume this year which was a good time for shopping since it coincides with Sydney's end of financial year sale. Being an eclectic art layperson, I also enjoy the whimsical pieces at Dr Suess Art Gallery and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York). You cam also pick up aboriginal art at the art gallery on the third floor of the building. For more affordable shoe and clothing stores, you can hit the basement floors for well-designed products.Tired out by all the shopping? Then head to any of the restaurants and cafes housed in QVB which offered both Italian and Asian fare ranging from the higher end Chinese restaurant, The Laughing Buddha to cool vibe cafes found mainly on the third floor.For caffeine fixes and healthier juice options, just go to level 1 and B2.By the way, there is a modeling and craft store in QVB called HobbyCo. The shop is a dream come true for toy enthusiasts. My son got himself some good Lego Star Wars and paints there.The high point for me is not the shopping but the beautiful Victorian architecture and design of the building. The building was restored and much of the historic design was preserved. One thing to look out for is the two clock chandeliers installed in side the building. The facade of the clock turns at every hour and thus, all the decorative pieces depicting important historical moments in Aussie's history can be seen from all perspectives.So, put on your shopping shoes and have a jolly good time at QVB."

Don't even have to walk outside to get to the QVB (Queen Victoria Building). If you do go outside, you can't miss the huge statue of Queen Victoria. Once inside take time to admire the stunning ornate architecture, stained glass windows, intricate stairs and ceilings. Start from the top and work your way down to the lower levels. Take the escalators or elevator to the 3rd floor (top) and admire the 2 amazing center clocks suspended from the ceiling. The castle clock is a must-see on the hour with trumpeters, followed by 6 scenes with animated figures, including wiggling girls near Henry VIII and the final scene of a beheading (thought it was hysterical). Meander and window shop the designer stores, or stop to eat. The desserts in the tea shops looked amazing, unfortunately wasn't particularly hungry at the time. A variety of stores on every level with some unique items and some expensive designer things, but worth a look around, even if you don't buy. Finally, make your way to the lower level and visit Victorias Basement store - tons of deals here! Specializing in kitchen type items that are bargains; purchased as gifts - linen tea towels for $6, set of nice cheese knives $10-$20, pot holders $4. And the store never seems to end, so many nooks and crannies of kitchenware, glasses, & gadgets. Plus the staff is super friendly and will help you find anything. It's easy to spend an hour in the basement store alone. When you're done, simply hop back on the train."

The Queen Victoria building hints at what glories of colonial architecture were lost in that period.The complex now provides host to many an expensive high end designer shop and tourist drawcards. Fortunately, these include fine restuarants and high end souviniers!Do'n't miss a visit to this magnificent building, even if only to explore thae marvellous multi level heritage architecture. Probably the closest thing Australia has to Galeries Lafayette in Paris, with an equally awe inspiring stained glass atrium.Make sure you have deep pockets if you intend having a big shopping spree here though. Your dollar will go much further at the Paddington Market!Highly recommended for its sheer beauty, scale and history!"

On my first visit I was so intrigued by the building itself that I didn't even bother looking at the shops and that's saying something for a shopaholic like me.There are tours I believe and I keep meaning to go on one but haven't yet.The shopping is fabulous and suits all pockets starting with the cheaper stores on the ground floors and going up to the more expensive designer shops and antiques and jewellery on the top.The building is accessible on several sides from the various streets in the city as well as underground leading into some of the other main stores across the road and also has access to the underground rail system.There are many coffee shops and cafes and also a very elegant restaurant which does an excellent high tea.Well worth a stroll around if not to shop just to admire the building itself and it's magnificent mechanical clock at it's centre which comes to life on the hour."

The building has three floors in addition to the basement level. The architecture is stunning and the lay out of the stores, shops and restaurants is so evenly structured and shapely. Lots of unique shops selling local goods, and shops selling internationally recognized specialties. The building is on George St. starting at Market down to Druid and Park, just opposite Town Hall. If arriving by underground Metro, you are able to walk underground from the Town Hall station right into the QVB. And also at the opposite end of the building you can cross over right into Myer Department Store. Good use for inclement weather. The huge astronomical clock is interesting, but the 12:00 clock show never happened. You may not want to buy anything here, but a stop for lunch or tea sounds good, and watch out for the Haigh's Chocolate Store at the Druid St. exit. You'll be drawn in by the sweet aroma of chocolate."

I never get bored, as there is always a plethora if new foods at the side walk cafes and although the shops offer high end designer brands, I can always find a must have bargain to take home. This is definitely not your DFO outlet stop, but even if you just look around (which doesn't cost anything) it's worth a visit.. The Block Arcade in Melbourne has the same vibe, albeit on a much smaller scale."

The building now houses a really great shopping mall, which is a wonderful place to browse or shop. It is carpeted and all the details inside are continuously fascinating. It is about the feeling you get while you are in this space, it is like you do not want to leave. Just a great feeling of satisfaction being in the surroundings, and very much like you are taken back in time, say 100 years ago. This is definitely a must see and again and again, and if you like to shop, some lovely shops, even if to just browse. Check it out."

If you get off the train at Town Hall Station you can even walk straight through the lower ground floor of the QVB and follow through to link with the Myer department store on the other side of the road. There is a large dome in the middle of the building and at Christmas time a huge Christmas tree stands in the lobby reaching up into the dome, covered with Swarovski crystals. There are two fascinating historic clocks hung from the ceiling on the second level which are fun to watch as characters move around at certain times. A great place to shop and then meet for coffee or lunch."

Even when the stores are closed, the two ends of the building were open, allowing me to walk through the empty levels of the building and explore stain glassed stair wells, glass ceilings, and ornate handrails that were just awesome. If you want to shop, visit when the bustle of people make the place come alive, but if you want to soak up the history, wander through after the stores are closed (and it saves you money as well!)."

The designer stores offer some top-notch products and the cute cafe's hidden on the upper floors offer some real delightful spots to grab a bite and a decent cup of coffee or tea. The architecture is absolutely beautiful and offers a lovely glimpse into Victorian times. (Also a great way to escape the sun and heat for a block!)"

I was actually travelling between two destinations when I saw the QVB, and decided I had time to take a peek. The building obviously has a historic quality, but the inside has been well maintained (or updated). Although, the stained glass pieces are still elegant, and the clockwork, well, clocks were also still drawing small crowds--even boutique workers came out to look. Sadly, I was barely able to peek at the end of the hourly event. Many shops within would classify as higher end, and boutique-style. If you're looking for brand names, I think there are shopping areas nearby. Within here, you can find more elegant and I daresay classy items, cultural pieces and art, jewelry, and of course, food from fine dining, to coffee and dessert. Hobbyco was my main stop, and they have an amazing assortment of toys, mostly Japanese model building, but also figures. It's worth a stop if you're an adult with the heart of a kid. But if you bring your kids, they might be there a while."

My interest was the ongoing architecture of the place and how it has stood the test of time, it is truly a great must visit place in your list of things to see in Sydney.

You can't miss this one if you are walking towards Hyde Park from the Harbour front. Check out the old elevator which is still in working condition and enjoy a cup of coffee in one of the wonderful cafes."

It doesn't matter about the shops that line all floors of this magnificent building as they don't detract at all from the architecture and the stunning vaulted ceilings and central clock.

The building is beautifully maintained. A Sydney Icon."

The Queen Victoria Building on George Street consists of four main shopping floors with lovely tessellated tilework (much of which is original, particularly under the central dome), stained glass windows and ornate arches. You'll find high end fashion stores to browse, restaurants and cafes here. The building was refurbished in 2008/2009, including new escalators that take you up to the first and second floors. For me, these escalators just seemed out of place. They were designed \"to be seen as a new sculptural element\" - minimalist and modern. I'm not sure I would agree they're a \"sculptural element\". Personally, I didn't like them at all."

One a return visit a few years later I couldn't believe the transformation. The Queen Victoria Building is one of Australia's best preserved structures and home to dozens of high and middle end shops. Every part of the build boasts period features, from the animated clock which attracts crowds every time it \"chines\" to the tiling, true to period paint colours and ornate ceilings and mouldings. It's well worth walking through and if you're catching a train it even offers direct access to Town Hall Station."

Nowadays the QVB is just a building I have to walk thru to get from Town Hall Station to Pitt Street Mall, (which I realise also sells over-priced generic tat but there's a slightly more variety and slightly less expense)"

Imagine a building to honour Queen Victoria whose imperial statue stands to the South of the Building and an expensive restoration. Then instead of making it an oasis of history and culture linked conveniently to Town Hall Station and a building for public use, convert it into a four level shopping mall of trendy designer shops and little snooty cafes. A better mix of development would have seen some more culture and history retained."

I enjoyed a good coffee upstairs at the Old Vienna Coffee House, which was much quieter than the caf\u00e9s downstairs. The clock is lovely, though I remembered it doing more when the hour struck??

It is both a wonderful tourist attraction as well as a practical place to go shopping or meet a friend for coffee.There are lifts and stairways as well as escalators, and the rest-rooms are clean and spacious.it's worth hanging around on an upstairs balcony near either of the two lovely antique clocks to hear them chime the hour. One of them even has an at times gruesome animated show that runs for about 5-6 minutes once the hour chimes.I visited on a rainy day, and was greeted by a little stand at the doorway that dispensed a plastic covering for the many dripping umbrellas that were being carried in.

The floors are colourful with hundreds of monarch tiles that people walk on and never take the time to just stop and look. The floors have central balcony that in circles in the middle of the building. There are shops of fashion top shop, Karen Miller, Bally, Coach, Pandora, Orton, Michael Kors, Mission and coffee bars and other things to temp the shopper. If you climb the 4 flights of stairs which curl in the middle of the building feel grand and powerful.. Just visit this place in the day or better at night as those fantastic bulbs are illuminated. This a great place to visit and take your camera."

QVB is one of the most beautiful buildings in the Sydney CBD and it is beautifully maintained. However, the food and beverage offerings, shopping and Christmas decorations are 'tired'. A rethink is needed before this important heritage landmark becomes just another ordinary attraction."

There is also a nicely and ornately decorated clock that would animate on the top of each hour.But underneath the nice Christmas decorations, QVB is still a typical shopping center with fairly typical shopping center stores. I don't recall any stores that were very unique, but the stores were not disappointing though. Definitely worth an hour or two of your time."

The QVB stands on its own as the most beautiful and distinctive of all the shopping arcades in the Sydney CBD (unless of course you have an unlimited budget and want to spend your time in Martin Place). The multi level building has been left with its beautiful original internal structures inside. It is worth going to see this alone. The lowest basement level houses the train station (Town Hall) and connects via a subway to Myers. It houses the cheapest shops in the building. It isn't my favourite area of the building. As you work your way up the levels, things get more exclusive. There is a number of fine jewellers on the top level and also an excellent pet accessories store. This time of year is really lovely to visit because they have the amazing Swarovski Christmas Tree. The tree spans three floors of the building and contains over 100,000 Swarovski cystals. It is beautiful. The whole arcade looks very attractive with the lights at the moment. There is also an Adriano Zumbo counter on the ground level of the building."

My wife and I visited Sydney recently and we visited this Building more than once ! :-) The choice of shopping within the Queen Victoria Building was just incredible, and this was combined with very good cafes and restaurants and very interesting iconic sights, including the clocks and (present when we visited) a display of ballet costumes. We enjoyed visiting the Building very much and came back twice more .. as for the choice of shopping, there were clothes shops, shoes shops, bag and accessories shops, jewellery shops, wonderful model figures (toy) shop, full toy shop, etc., etc. It was all just the most wonderful shopping and when you visit Sydney we would say that the Queen Victoria Building is a `` must see `` icon. A wonderful experience indeed ! :-) :-)"

Five floors of fine shops and cafes to suit most people. Over the Christmas holidays it is a must see to go and view the Christmas tree that is in the centre of the buildings. It goes from the ground floor to the top. Also look for the large old clock that hangs a bit more than halfway down towards the southern end. Every hour it chimes and provides a pageantry of figures. Well worth your time."

Well done the Government!Now it is the \"London's Burlington Arcade\" of Sydney, full of boutique shops and cafes.Overhead are the 20 different size small domes and the main copper covered dome. At night it is beautifully illuminated on the ground floor for the window shoppers to enjoy, and the side of the building even more so looks like a Palace with it numerous columns.Brian, from Perth.

Glorious architecture, a wide variety of shops including the ones I love to look in but could never bring myself to buy. And then there is Victoria's Basement with its wonderful array of bargain priced home goods. The perfect place for a little splurge or a few gifts."

They tend to get more expensive as you go up in levels. For many years it was derelict and abandoned and the local government and private developers united to renovate in the late 20th century and what Sydney got was a Victorian masterpiece. Be sure to visit at Christmas - the southern hemispheres' biggest xmas tree goes on display complete with swarovski crystal ornaments. See the special clock on the top level on the hour.

Then along came a wealthy Asian investor who transformed the bones into what it has become today: a multi-level upmarket shopping mall including fashion and dining with some specialty shops such as fine chocolates, home wares and jewellery; access point to Town Hall underground station; home of the ABC shop. In the basement you can find access to parking station. Upstairs you are right on a bus terminal. Across the road is the Sydney Town Hall. Nearby is the Haymarket and the Darling Harbour precinct. In the basement you can find a heavily patronised Asian restaurant specialising in Malaysian street food. Accessible by rail, bus and foot. Amenities coming out of its ears"

It has mosaic tile floors, a huge domed roof in the middle of the four story building, and a beautiful winding staircase with solid wooden balustrades leading from floor to floor.This was a statement of prosperity in the 1890s when it was build in the middle of what is now Sydney's CBD.In the 1980s, with urban development gone mad, developers wanted to knock it down and build a modern high rise. Such was the protest from the people of Sydney and the Workers' Union of Australia, that instead of knocking it down it was fully renovated and reopened in 1986 as a center for 180 boutique shops, with a food court in the basement.You don't have to buy anything when you go there (it is all a bit expensive). But just marvel at the glorious architecture and design of which was originally a common and garden meat and vegetable market."

That's unlikely to happen now. multi level, full of the some of the best names in town with delightful cafe's and centrepiece clocks hanging from the central ceiling, the QVB is everything that shopping and society and architecture can deliver in a single double espresso hit. Beautifully restored and maintained, the Tea Room on the top floor is a must.....after Dr.Seuss and some shopping.

If you were travelling through Europe or the UK you probably wouldn't give a building like this a second glance. Here in Sydney it is on a short list of the more interesting historical buildings.

However, even as a humble marketplace the building included two impressive stained glass windows which display the arms of the city of Sydney. The building in my memory became very run down but after restoration in the late twentieth century the building has been returned to its former grandeur. Set in the centre of the city the QVB is great place to meet friends but while there do walk around the very top floor of the building which houses a fascinating range of odd ball shops."

It is a very attractive building offeringgreatfacilties and a broad selection of cafes, eateries and variety of speciality retailers. Some of these are unusual and interesting, the map and print store, hobby store and jewellery stores were . The range of clothing was great and offered good differentiation against the usual shopping complex stores. There are many interesting features worth noting , the world clock, stained glass windows and period staircases were interesting. Well worth the visit ."

The QVB is a wonderful place to shop and browse through one of many specialty stores that sell anything from delicious chocolates, high end fashion and curios and unique gifts. Furthermore, the QVB also connects through to other shopping arcades and malls within the city centre. This is a great place to visit and a nice addition to any Sydney must do list."

On the top level is the beautiful clock with figures that move to music on the hour.Even the stylish loos are worth a visit.There are many well known names amongst the many shops- ABC shop, Aboriginal Art Galleries, Bally, Camper, Georg Jensen and The Metropolitan Museum of Art as well as many more. On the basement level is Victoria's Basement with many more shops but not so pricey.There are many cafes including a counter of the famed Adriano Zumba pastries.We sat a small cafe Parisi which was very busy. A toasted panini and a salad cost $14 and $15 so expensive but really enjoyed a chocolate dipped fresh fig ($3.50).QVB... highly recommended."

The Byzantine architecture is incredible with beautiful stairways, arches, atriums, stained glass windows, woodwork, balconies, rails, domes, etc. The tile work on the floors is incredible and the paint scheme is amazing. The building went through different phases where it was a market, concert hall, city library, municipal offices and the current shopping mall. Again, this should not be missed and it\u2019s free."

The QVB is as classic and impressive piece of Victorian architecture as you'll ever see, occupying a full city block and topped by a massive copper dome. It's worth having a look around the exterior before venturing inside for another perspective on its grandeur. Thanks partly to the many upmarket shops, if anything its interior is even more opulent. There is magnificent detail in stained glass, stonework and wrought iron. And to think that before the building's top-to-toes restoration in the 1980s there was talk of its demolition. Once you have admired the building, there are many and varied shops to check out across four levels, including plenty of coffee shops and cafes. Except for many of those on the underground level, which can be a frantic pedestrian thoroughfare to/from Town Hall Station, virtually all the shops are beautifully presented.

Back then I was an excited 20 year old out in the big wide world going shopping with my friends at Queen Victoria Building in Sydney, boy how cool was I!. As a I had grown up in a small country town, you can imagine how totally \"in awe\" I was of the whole experience and the feeling it gave me just being there. I remember eating at the trendy cafes and just walking around for hours gazing through windows at some of the most beautiful clothes I had ever seen! Fast forward 18 years into the future about 2 years ago, I visited there again on my trip to Sydney. In all honesty I was absolutely astounded by the timeless, classic beauty of this fabulous iconic building. I was also very impressed that in 18 years, this shopping centre had exceeded my expectations in retaining its former \"Glory!\" The shopping, cafes and overall experience were not only what I had remembered it to be but so much better!"

Great toy store for puzzles of Australia to take home. The escalators are modern and you enter from a glass platform which is a super contrast the the history of the building you see.

The tilings are stylish the layout open the floors a joy to walk on. The clocks are great. It's the sort of building that wouldn't be out of place in Knightsbridge!

The large bronze statue of Queen Victoria at the York Street entrance was shipped to Sydney from Dublin, Ireland. Inside the building, there are the original cage-style elevators, as well as cedar and porcelain tiled stairwells running from the basement to the top floor. The basement offers a variety of cooked food suitable for a light or heart lunch. It is connected to the subway at a Town Hall station. An array of stores fill the ground floor and the top floor is upmarket with a range of boutiques, coffee shops, and one if my favourite places:.the New York Museum of Contemprary Art Gift and bookshop (The Met) .

It is a shopping cntre (on the posh side) but you cannot miss a visit here and I'm sure you will be as impressed as we were with the architecture and decor. If you're not shopping then simply have a coffee and admire the views!!"

The beauty and magnificence of the building really took my breath away. The exterior is fabulous and the interior gets visitors back to a grand old era when builders took real pride in their craftsmanship. Inside is stacked with high-end shops and as I'm not a shopping fanatic it didn't attract me so much except to imagine the grandieur of past architecture and design. Don't miss the sculture of Queen Victoria just south of the QVB, which actually once stood in Ireland and was purchased and transported to Sydney in 1947!"

The outside fa\u00e7ade hints that this is a special place but it's the inside that has the \u201cwow\u201d factor. Kudos to those who restored this building as they kept some great original features including the staircases, lifts, wrought-iron balustrades, stained glass windows, domes and tilework (tessellated and mosaics). The glass roof allows natural light to illuminate all four floors of this amazing building. Take a couple minutes and check out the quirky bathrooms (try not to linger too long and freak out those using them). The famous \"Royal Clock\" and \"Great Australian Clock\" are also definitely worth a look. Yes, they also have shopping. There are many little boutiques and some large chain retail stores in this building in addition to a wide choice of cafes. While enjoying coffee and pastry at Cellini\u2019s Caf\u00e9, we were amazed by how busy it was at 2 in the afternoon on a Tuesday in the middle of winter. It is clearly a great place to come to do a little people watching, or some shopping, or enjoy a coffee, or just admire the architecture. Highly recommend a visit here for whatever reason you fancy."

It operated under a number of different guises from housing warehouses for the home handyman, haberdashery et al. It was in a state of neglect for a long time until it was re furbished during the 1980s. It now houses many retail stores on a number of levels, it is a short cut to town hall station and china town, during Sydney's hot summer it makes for a nice short cut.There is a statute of queen Victoria sitting at the entrance of QVB. Pop in have a look see, take a short cut, walk pass town hall, which use to be a cemetery until they relocated the graves."

Since then and relatively recently it's had a paint job. Australia is a new country founded only in 1788, as such there are not a lot of old world cultural buildings. The QVB as it's known to sydney sightseers, is our grand dame. On the west end of the buildings entrance sits the large imposing statue of queen Victoria herself. The building itself occupies one block and sits between George and York streets in Town hall. The entry/exit into town hall station leads you into the bottom level of QVB which if you keep walking through will eventually lead you to the major Pitt Street mall shopping district. QVB is grand in style and as you go up the levels the shops become more expensive. The middle is hollow so from the top you can see the bottom levels. Lots of charming caf\u00e9s and antique shops. It also houses two major clocks that go off on the hour. Worth checking out. Taking pictures here is a treat. Lots of curves and stain glass. At Xmas I think QVB Has the best tree in Sydney. The only other building that matches it's charm but on a smaller scale is the strand arcade further along George st. Oh yeh Sydney has a thriving busking scene. The uber talented ones are generally featured in Pitt st mall. The ones that don't make that cut often end up sharing their gift with the world next to Queen Victoria as she glares down on all the mere mortals."

The quirky, 'talking dog' wishing well near the main entrance is a busy tourist attraction. Entering the QV building you cannot help but be impressed with the style, light and colour of the shopping areas.

            "review": "\" a distinctive shopping mall\". The Queen Victoria Building (QVB) is a busy 4 floor shopping mall that is connected to the City Rail lines on the bottom floor. Everything you need is available for purchase here and it can get very busy with foot traffic during the commute hours as the eating --- to go foods are located on the ground floor connected by the City Rail lines. You will be moved along with the constant flow of foot traffic moving one way on the left side. The shops get more expensive as you head up each floor. Must see the distinctive stain glass windows in the middle of the mall as well as the Australian and Royal Clocks which can be viewed the best on the 4th floor-- the do ring on the hour and the figurines in the clocks come out or revolve around the clock. Lot of small little boutiques that sell unique clothing or items. Good to window shop here. Honestly, the QVB was our lifesaver on an early Saturday morning when our attraction reservation was cancelled without notifying us. We needed to look for a possibility for breakfast around 7:45 a.m. and we did not want to return back to our lodging. Everything on George St. was pretty much closed with the exception of McDonald's and Hungry Jacks, but luckily I remembered the QVB ground floor that had all the various eateries available, not noticeable from the street level. Go for a visit if you have the opportunity. Definitely not the type of shopping mall you would find back home."

It is beautiful, from the tiles to the stained glass. Of course the shops in here are not usually the cheap ones, but they are of a very nice standard. There are several tourist type shops that sell Australian souvenirs that are a cut above what you can buy in most parts of town. There are many eating places and a couple of wine bars. It is not just a place for tourists, the locals use this daily. Don't forget to watch the magical clocks chime in the hour and do their little performance, then go downstairs to Haigh's chocolates for a little treat, start with the dark chocolate mint frogs. Then wander the building looking at the beauty of what it is and remembering what could have been."

My favourite thing to do is wander along the levels and in and out of the many high end shops then I usually stop for a coffee on one of the higher levels and just sit and people watch. It is a piece of history right in the middle of the Sydney CBD and I hope that it remains so for many more years to come. The spiral stairs and small elevator are the originals from the late 1800's when the building was first opened, the whole building is a fantastic glimpse of architecture from this period.

The signature piece is the statue of Queen Victoria, the second most striking aspect of the building is its shape and size as it is effectively one long tunnel of consumerist excess. With multiple levels and some cafes that are as pretentious as the people sitting in them this is the sort of place whose contents you'll either love or loathe but one this is for sure the long edifice is in contrast to much of what is around it.A place to at least wander through if only to window shop."

I never tire of spending time here when in Sydney; especially Victoria's Basement (which may well be listed separately) The building can be easily recognised by the large statue of Queen Victoria near the entrance. There is also a statue of a small talking dog - and wishing well. From there, you can also walk quite a distance underground where there are lots of nice cafes, shops etc. The inside of the building is stately with beautifully marbled floors - different in each section, old style elevators, stained glass windows and gracious archways. Every part of the building is spotless. There's lots of good restaurants to choose from but if you just want a quick snack to take away, head underground. The best viewing point for the chiming clock is on the top level, although there are lots of large advertising posters hanging from the ceiling so make sure you look for the right vantage point. This is a real step back in time to the era of style & elegance."

I guess that they're playing to tourists, thinking that, no matter what they sell or what they serve, it's a \"one shot deal.\" We'll never see them again. We had lunch in the Chinese restaurant on the second level (didn't bother to take the name as it was awful) - how can they do such a bad dim sum? But do see the building!"

The curved staircases with huge stained glass windows on outer walls are very eye-catching, as is the crystal chandalier in the Chinese Restaurant on the top floor, visible through an archway while standing at the top of one of the escalators. And I have to say, the conveniences are the fanciest I have seen for many a year, though they are in need of a bit of TLC. The long granite vanity you encounter when you first enter is impressive, but from there on it's all downhill, so much so that one of the cubicle doors is so ill fitting that daylight (and other things) can be seen through the gap!"

It is located in the middle of the CBD under the shadow of the Sydney Tower, and you find lots of small cafes and shops in the QVB. Additionally, it is a focal point of the area, and used as a meeting place, both underground and above ground by the roads. You can see many businessmen and tourists standing near the QVB eating their sandwiches and talking on their phones. When you are in the CBD part of Sydney then a 15 minute stroll around the arcade inside QVB is a must, just to take in the history of it all. However, it is not a true tourist attraction, so don't plan your day around it."

There are lots of lovely shops to browse through and I noted that prices in many were within reason. Worth a walk through.

During a quick visit on Wednesday I picked up a leaflet advertising a guided tour of the QVB on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 11.30am. The time had been hand-written in to amend the time originally printed of 1pm. At $15 for a 45 minute tour I thought this was on the high side but, as this is something I usually very much enjoy, I returned to the city the next day and timed it to present myself at Concierge fifteen minutes before the appointed time. Imagine my disappointment to be told these no longer run at 11.30 and I should return at 1.30 to take the tour? My schedule for the day did not allow for this, nor for my last three days which were already mapped out. There was no apology offered: in fact the whole issue was dealt with very nonchalantly. How long would it take to go through the leaflets on display an check the time was correct, especially as the time had been amended once already. How many other similar leaflets are already in people's hands?I have to say the QVB has remained remarkably unchanged since my first visit over twenty yeas ago. I commend their building maintenance programme, it is an effective one. Pity the same cannot be said for the upkeep of the Ladies restroom: half an hour later there was no soap at the wash station I used; this is obviously not checked regularly.i have rated this from a customer satisfaction viewpoint only. I did not shop or eat there."

The architecture is distinctive and there are many beautiful stained glass windows. So take a peek at a bit of unique history.

If one wants a variety of fashion, it\u2019s here. Great coffee, it\u2019s here and there\u2019s choice \u2013 restaurants, coffee shops, takeaway bars if you\u2019ve ventured into the subway. There are some that you can easily gauge their popularity by the number of people at the establishment. Try one of those. There\u2019s a host of other shopping possibilities, too. If you decide to visit, allow yourself time. You can\u2019t visit the building and do it justice in a short visit. I love the atmosphere and charm of this heritage listed building.My favourite, Victoria\u2019s Secret, in the basement where one can acquire quality branded housewares at well below retail price. Pick your time pack your patience, too, because it could be a crush: the basement which sells mainly quality brands is very popular and I regularly return on each visit to Sydney. All I need is more baggage weight to convey the articles. How fortunate are the Sydneysiders in this regard.The building is close to Town Hall station and endless buses go past. While you\u2019re visiting the building, be sure to travel in the lifts (an experience in itself) to the upper level to view the royal clock. It\u2019s a great visit to the past, colourful and very interesting, and while I could describe it in detail, I simply suggest you go yourself. Try to be there on the hour to see a complete performance by the clock. Be early for the viewing so you obtain a spot for photographs. It\u2019s a popular sight to put on the list of things to do.Oh, yes, and don\u2019t forget your credit card. A coffee may satisfy you during a visit but I would be surprised if you weren\u2019t tempted to buy something else during a visit to the Queen Vic. Building because, while it\u2019s not a $2 shop, not everything here is exorbitantly priced."

This late 1880s building once housed the City of Sydney Library and was due to be demolished until Malaysian interests acquired, then refurbished it to its former glory at a cost of many millions. But what a stunning result! It is accessed from ground and also below-ground level, the latter serving to link the Town Hall railway station. The huge building now houses a wealth of high-fashion clothing, shoe and accessory boutiques, chic little coffee shops, newsagents, a couple of banks, chocolatiers, jewellers and an upmarket merchandise store in the basement. But most people are happy to marvel at the intricate mosaics once they enter from the Town Hall side (where an imposing statue of a stern, but young, Queen Victoria looks out over busy George Street) or, indeed, any other side on the four-street frontage. In the middle, if you look up past the wrought-iron lace balconies of the upper levels, you will notice a Glockenspiel which delights viewers every quarter-hour with a parade, but the big parade of doll-like figures occurs every hour. It's different from the Galleria opposite Milan's Duomo in that it is far less grand and not as well open to the elements but, for all that, it has an appeal unique to Sydney, and should NOT be missed!"

Allot of the building inside is old, the lifts are old it probably gets the odd leak from heavy rains and fresh airconditioning."

The architecture itself is spectacular and you can feel the \"empire\" all around. There\u00b4s a lift taking you up to the varoius floors....amazing style. I found one of my hair salons there that used to be in Double Bay years ago...was thrilled...got an appointment for a haircut."

On it's lowest level you can walk from the Pitt Street Mall and under the QVB and onto Town Hall Station, shopping all the way. The shops on the ground and upper floors range from medium priced to very upmarket, so even if you're not there to shop, the window shopping is wonderful. There's men and womens fashion, jewellery, homewares, antiques, art the list goes on and on. The dining ranges from cafes to licenced restaurants. Most are opened for late breakfast, lunch and very early dinner. Trading hours are 9am to 6pm weekdays, and 9am to 9pm Thursdays, and I think it opens at 11am on a Sunday. The architecture is lovely, built in 1898 with stained glass windows grand staircases (lifts and escalators too if you can't do stairs). The clock in the centre of the building that has moving bits to entertain when it strikes the hour, the lady who play the grand piano at certain times of the day, I could go on and on, there's also underground parking (at a price).

The building is three levels high but has a charm and class that makes it the absolute opposite to your average Westfield Shopping Centre. Most retail outlets in the QVB, to be fair, are high-end shops and cafes - Dolce & Cabbana and esteemed fashion labels where the entire shop has 6 garments for sale to impress upon shoppers exclusivity and eye watering price. Cafes are stylish with tables and chairs out in the main levels, allowing customers the experience of dining or enjoying a skinny soy chai decaf babycino (or whatever absurd combination the beautiful people sip) while viewing the impressive architecture. I soent some time at both Hobbyco (a double level hobby/model store) and at an art gallery that specialises in licenced official Dr Suess prints and scultpures. I could have spent around $50k at the Dr Suess gallery and the same again at Hobbyco.

Three stories high with subterranean floors, the building now houses boutiques. But, the true draw of the building is not the shops but the architecture, e.g., the stained glass windows, the interior glass dome, and two large mechanical clocks, each with a diorama and moving figures. Located in the central business district, the QVB is a short, worthwhile walk from the wharf."

The QVB is an iconic central Sydney landmark building that offers prestige old charm shopping in a luxurious, genuine Victorian era buiding that is breath-taking in its architecture and decor.Enter the era of refinery, formal facades, elegant architecture and 4 prominade floors of high fashion shops and gifts to suit both the discerning shopper or the fascinated tourist.From the outside the QVB stands the length of an entire city block, with its sculptured sandstone facade and lead light windows making you wonder whether it's a cathederal or shopping centre ..the quality and style is so similar.Inside the building is spaceous, airconditioned for comfort and restored to its 1890s charm by its careful heritage conscious owners who understand the attraction of such a shopping experience. The shops are many of the prime fashion labels and outlet names, with the presentation style of every shop one of amazing and a match to the building's quality.As you'd expect to see in any Victorian Building, there's plenty of tea shops , even one that serves \"High Tea\" with linen table cloths and formal waiters.Easily accessible from Sydney's main George Street or take the train to Town Hall Station, that is right underneath the QVB. Buses are also in the street outside.Indulge yourself. Take a look."

As a child I would go to the City of Sydney library here, and wander around the stacks for hours, descending through drab offices and pokey corridors. Well possums, it has had the ultimate makeover and is now restored to it's original state as a grand shopping arcade, in the Victorian style. There are some of Sydney's best fashion brands here, some great designers (do try on Alistair Trung's clothes - they look better on you than on the hanger!) and great accessories - I love Thomas Szabo, and some of the bespoke jewellery shops have original and modern settings of local opals and pearls, and you can get a handbag to match that lace evening frock... Have a meal (Yama for sushi is a fav with my family) or high tea in the Tea Rooms; sample the ABC shop for DVD's about Australia's wildlife, and buy a little box of handmade chocolates to take to someone special. The clock in the centre of the building strikes the hours in very Australian style, best seen on the third floor, where you will also find great paper and pen shops, antiques and prints and fabulous Florentine leather bound journals.

Retailers are constantly moaning that they can't sell their wares to the public, yet every retailer bar one (Vienna Coffee House) was closed throughout the Queen Victoria Building on New Years Day. Hundreds of people (including overseas tourists) were wandering around the QVB but could not purchase anything. That said the Vienna Coffee House did a roaring trade on the first floor. Very very disappointing, we came to Sydney over the new year period and shopping was one thing on our list of things to do. Unfortunately QVB and its store holders came up very short and failed dismally to deliver. Its all well and good to moan about the public not buying but if you aren't open then you the stores have nothing to moan about. The tourists who were there that day must have been wondering what on earth was happening.Finally if the chocolate store at the northern entrance of QVB cannot spell \"Christmas\" properly on its \"Opening Hours Sign\", then one wonders about just how much care is taken with its products."

You can see a clock that has a moving display, replicas of the crown jewels, and other strange things. At Christmas it usually has a large tree. A bit upmarket for my taste it is nice to walk through. The shops on the bottom floor(s) (read underground) are cheaper. There is also a large statue of Queen Victoria on the outside on the end nearest the Town Hall."

From the basement to the top floor, there are shops aplenty to meet the needs of most shoppers; from the very expensive to the economical. Shop till you drop if you like, but if you need sustenance or just a beverage break to recharge yourself, there are also plenty of cafes and eateries serving cuisines from different cultures. One of my favourites is the ChaTime beverage shop where one can find many different types of tea and not-caffeinated drinks both hot and cold.One shortcoming of the place is the lack of seats for shoppers who just wish to have a rest without eating or drinking and for those who are waiting while their partners/friends are happily drowning in the sea of merchandise in QVB."

Then there are the other floors with top name shops. At the very top you can have lunch or treat yourself to a high tea. The high tea is in lovely surroundings and the food is fab. Dont eat too much before you go as you get plenty there. Ask for the red chairs, you feel like a princess sitting in them rather than the normal ones....."

However, it is filled with modern, contemporary shops and cafes, and it is certainly worth spending a couple of hours walking through the arcade. It is also right smack in the middle of the Sydney shopping belt."

Romanesque Revival style over 4 floors (plus a subterranean level to Town Hall Station and Market Street) and filling one city block. Beautifully restored and full of shops catering to all comers. Mostly middle-high end fashion stores (Coach, Longchamp, Ferragamo) and cafes on the ground floor level. Upper levels have jewellers, antiques, sportswear, more fashion, eyewear, hobby & models for big kids (men), the tea room,collectors items and some quirky boutiques. Adults will love the people watching from cafes, open space, architecture and good quality shops. Kids love the big clocks with dioramas & animated figures which can be viewed up close from the top floor. There are lovely old wrought iron stairs with nice wide treads or modern escalators to choose from to make your way up to the top. Photo worthy from all angles, inside and out. At the southern exterior plaza there is a massive statue of Queen Victoria herself and a smaller 'talking\" statue of Islay, her dog. The western side is a commuter hub for buses and the subterranean (lower ground) floor is a major commuter route. Avoid these in the mornings around 7-9am and in the afternoons from 4-6.30pm when they get very crowded and everyone is in a rush."

Instead of joining the queue for breakfast in the hotel, we slipped across the road and found a restaurant in the QVB for a more relaxing (and cheaper!) start to the day.Shops for everyone, and definitely fashion choices you won't get outside of Oz.

There are also cafe-style restaurants in between the stores. In addition, the bottom level of QVB is an underground air con transfer tunnel to the Town Hall train station which is a major transit point. Great place for tourists to visit."

The Queen Victoria Building, nowadays referred to as the QVB, was completed in 1898.A Romanesque style architecture was chosen so that many out-of-work craftsmen (stonemasons, plasters, stained window artists) could be employed.The building underwent many remodelling changes to suit the needs of its different tenants over the years.The building was mainly empty and facing demolition during the period 1959 to 1971. The restored building reopened to the public in November 1986.The lower ground level is a busy daily commuter \"passageway\" from the Town Hall Station to the Pitt Street Mall and beyond. The QVB building covers an entire city block bound by George, Market, York and Druitt Streets.A multi-million dollar refurbishment was completed in 2009. It involved balustrades, bathrooms, carpet, new escalators connecting upper floors, elevators, painting (vibrant colours) and signage.Numerous bus routes stop at or near the QVB. Town Hall train station is minutes away.Well worth visiting for a coffee and snack and to explore the variety of shops on the four levels.View the various stained glass windows around the building.Do not forget to view the large clocks.The Concierge desk is located on the ground floor near the centre Dome. Guided tours are held on a regular basis. Bookings are essential and a fee is charged.Click on the website link on main screen for various info topics about the QVB"

            "review": "Pretty building, but not extraordinary; worth visiting if it's on your route. The Queen Victoria Building (QVB) has a pretty interior, primarily because of its colorful glass roof, turn-of-the-century decor, and arcade design. But it's not pretty enough to warrant going too far out of your way, especially because its exterior is rather plain; the Sydney Town Hall, located next to it, is a far more interesting building. There's nothing for tourists to do inside the QVB because it's just a mall with pricy stores, so unless you enjoy shopping (or window-shopping), you won't spend more than five minutes here. Many of the stores are the usual, ubiquitous pricy chains such as Swarovski, Ferragamo, and Ralph Lauren; but to be fair, a few are more interesting non-chain stores, such as Peter Nathan Toy Soldiers. Coffee lovers are advised that there are several cafes here, including a Starbucks. If you decide to visit, don't forget to see the statue of Queen Victoria herself, looking unamused outside the south entrance to the QVB."

Beautiful coloured glass and dark wood Victorian era mall. Easy access to other transportation hubs."

It's quaint, delicious and a fun little outing."

It's really worth a visit for the exterior and interior architecture, which has been very maintained. Be sure to look at the clocks and the tile work. The building is full of stores; many are expensive, but there is a nice selection of items from clothing to toys to gifts. There are also a few cafes; my favorite was the old Vienna coffeehouse upstairs, which had great desserts, reasonably-priced lunches, and allows you to sit in the atrium so you can enjoy a leisurely lunch and the architecture! Don't miss the basement level; it's not as stunning architecturally, but it has some good stores and is connected to the train station."

The shops are mostly sophisticated fashion brands though, you just have to have good imagination.Tips: You can still walk through it even the shops are all closed, usually about 5pm, fri and sat about 9pm. So, go at night after the crowds left (like we did), take time to admire this old beautiful building, be inspired by its colourful tiles and architecture design. Most importantly, imagine how people a few centuries ago used to stand on the same spot you are standing. A true experience and the real meaning of travelling."

It was originally the market building for Sydney and fell into quite a dilapidated state before it was restored to become a shopping mall. While I'm not a big fan of the mostly expensive shops and cafes inside, at least they've enabled the building to survive.It's worth wandering around, looking at the tiles, the old-fashioned lifts, the dome and the clocks. On a recent visit to Sydney, they had a really interesting art video projected onto the dome every hour, which was well worth watching. If you're in the CBD, the QVB would be an interesting place to stop."

If you're looking for a place to walk and shop/window shop, as well as take in some Australian history, this is the place for you. It's worth the \"hop off.\"It's not a building, but an entire city block that houses 19th century and Romanesque architecture, beautiful tiled floors and stained glass. There are five stories that comprise 70 upscale designer boutiques, as well as the city library. Beautiful, colorful and nice to see where the privileged shop. Before the end of our time there, we managed to find one shop that was willing to work with us. My husband purchased a beautiful Australian opal bracelet and ring for me at a reasonable cost.

There are many shops with the more expensive ones being on the higher levels.A nice attraction is the clock which 'comes alive' at various times throughout the day. This is best viewed from the upper levels. This is lovely for kids to see as much as adults. The problem I found was that there is only one baby change room in the whole building (and there are 4 levels!). The change room is in the basement tucked away and is very difficult to find. I thought that I had maybe just missed the other change areas as I felt sure that such a large building should have more than one place to change kids. I checked the website and sure enough I did manage to find the only change area in the whole building.It seems like an afterthought that people may actually want to change their children's nappies and I was a bit annoyed at this sentiment. I don't like feeling like a second class citizen just because I have little children."

I had a disappointing lunch at one of the many cafes, and browsed all the stores. There were too many name brand stores for me.
