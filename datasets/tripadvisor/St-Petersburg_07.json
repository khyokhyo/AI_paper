Was the summer palace of Catherine the Great and apart from the gardens, you can find opera singers performing live in the houses nearby. The palace itself is worthy of enchanted dreams. A must be done in your route through the world."

The scale, size, detail, and intricacy of the architecture is amazing. The grounds are amazing. A wonderful experience. The palace gets very busy with large crowds, so come early, especially to get tickets to tour the inside of the palace. Unfortunately, we got there shortly after noon, and they were already sold out of all tickets for the interior tours. You can easily access the town of Pushkin by train from St. Petersburg, so a \"tour\" is not necessary. The Palace is several blocks from the train station. Catherine Palace is a MUST see."

Nearly a half century ago I dreamed of waltzing in the grand ballroom of the Romanov's summer palace, Tsarskoeye Selo, as I read Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra. Never did I expect to enjoy its spendor outside my imagination. Yet here I am, surrounded in this one room by more splendor than in all sixty of my previous years combined. It's all I ever envisioned -- and more.As I toured room after room of gilt (okay, really over-the-top gilt) and opulence, my head traveled between the many books I'd read about the family, trying to reconcile the fact I was physically there with my then-certainty I'd never see, in person, any of what I read. Having a tour guide who verbally connected rooms and historical events was priceless.I appreciated the beauty of the restoration even more courtesy of the contrast between the photos of the palace after its destruction by the Bolsheviks and additional images of the painstaking procedures used to restore the palace to its original splendor. Warning -- there's a great deal of walking. But for Russian history buffs, Tsarskoye Selo is a St Petersburg must."

We took public buses without speaking the language, for very cheaply and without any problems (to/from). The place is stunning! There were no lines when we went- we also went through a side door close to where the public bus drops you. Like the Peterhof, the museum is gorgeous, but the gardens are where you want to spend most of your time. So much to see. Also takes student discount."

But what if there were a dozen of him, each creating his or her own palace of similar proportions. Ridiculous? No, it's here.Tsarkoye Selo is a large area with lots of Tsarist palaces and grounds. Perhaps the greatest of these is the Catherine Palace (one of Peter the Great's children, not Catherine the Great). We've reviewed that separately, but this is a large area with many palaces. It's also close to more modern attractions like the restaurant where Vladimir Putin spent his 50th birthday.This is a window into a world from the 18th and 19th centuries that few of us can imagine."

We asked at the information desk which desk sells tickets for Tsarskoye Selo and they said any in the train station. So after more than half an hour of queue we discovered that there was only one desk on the tracks selling tickets for this attraction so we waited for nothing and then we almost missed the train. It was a rainy day so that did not helped our mood either. From the train station you need to take a bus (good luck with that if you don't speak Russian) until the Palace. There you have a bit of walking to do, just follow the other tourists. Ok, now you arrived at the queue for the tickets to enter in the Museum Park. Be patient. After you buy this tickets you either have the option of visiting the park and go back to St. Petersbourg or to queue around 4 (four!!!) hours to enter the museum. There are no online tickets (sic!) In the park you have a small restauration in case you'll become hungry. We made it in almost the last group to enter. It is a very interesting full of history place to visit but at 5pm after standing in the rain so many hours our attention was almost lost."

It is located in Pushkin ( till 1917 named Tsarskoye Selo and also known as \u201cTsar's Village\"), about 25 km south of St. Petersburg.During World War II all the buildings were deliberately destroyed by German soldiers when they retreated after the failed siege of Leningrad. However, before it was gone so far, the major part of the valuable contents was brought in safety by Russian registrars, except the so-called. Amber Room. This was taken away by the Nazis and has been disappeared since. After the war, the palace was gradually rebuilt The palace is known for its large ballroom with a beautiful painted ceiling and numerous distinctive decorated smaller rooms. Remarkable are the large stoves with Delft blue tiles. The palace was designed by the Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli in lavish rococo style, which Catherine didn\u2019t like. For her personal residence she ordered to build a modest building in the Greek style. The palace is now open to visit. One can visit the venues and the extensive collection of artifacts (such as books, porcelain, chairs and clothes ). The walls of the amber room were lined with artfully carved amber panels. This \"Amber Room of the Czar\" was throughout Eastern Europe famous for its beauty. Its disappearance has given rise to the legend that the Amber Room was hidden in a train in the Owl Mountains in Poland in Wa\u0142brzychThe Soviet government, as well as countless adventurers have spared no effort after April 1945 to find the amber panels. This was done on the basis of numerous studies and theories, and in the most diverse places, far beyond Kaliningrad. In 1997, German police seized the aforementioned stone mosaic and later in the same year a commode that had been in the Catherine Palace at the Amber Room. In August 2015 there were all kind of speculations in the press about the location of the train, but the treasure was never foundreconstruction of the room was completed on may 31 2003 and has been opened By Vladimir Putin on the same day as the 300th anniversary of St-Petersburg"

However, I find it really annoying that on Trip Advisor, two identical attractions (Tsarskoye Selo basically encompasses the Catherine Palace and Park) are reviewed separately and exist as different landmarks so at least one of them should come down in the ratings. If you go to Pushkin, you will see all of this for sure and you'll have a wonderful time.

Price is around EUR 0.80 and drivers drive like cray but is the quickest way, around 20 min. It is useful to buy ticket online as it will safe you one line. As we went in the summer we had the chance to walk the gardens while it was relatively mild weather as it was early morning. Then the pain! The only one slot for tourists that are not in groups is from 12 to 14h. There one other at 16h. The queue starts forming around 11 h but at 12 it gets cray. People start pushing and jumping the queue. It was horrible, total chaos. And all this under the scorching sun. Actually there is a possibility to bend the queue in the shady side of the alley, but thinking about visitors needs is outside Russian priorities. Tourists are treated like cattle. Inside everyone is attached to a group but it is so chaotic that people walk in all directions and is very crowded. You have to jostle for every square inch. The palace itself is truly amazing with the banquet hall and the amber room the highlights. Everything was demolished during WW2 and is magnificently restored, worth the wait and the annoyances."

To avoid long queues pre-book your tickets through the official site and note down your order number. We were then able to pick up the tickets from 12 at a kiosk (by the church gate) without having to wait in a long line. Beware you will not be allowed to take in bottled water and larger backpacks have to be stored in the cloakroom. If you speak Russian you can join a group inside, where you will be given headphones and listen to the tour guide as you walk though the palace. We however decided to walk through ourselves as we have already read extensively about the palace. Before entering the rooms you will have to put on disposable show covers, which are free. During our visit only 10 rooms were open including the amber room and the rest were closed. It was nevertheless stunning. We spent about an hour and a half going through the rooms as there were many groups and the flow of people is regulated so sometimes you will have to wait to be let through. After visiting the palace we made our way to the gardens. There are many pathways you can take around and smaller pavilions to visit. The lakes have stunning views and there is also a small Chinese pavilion on the outskirts."

Then we were towed through all the magnificent halls by a very tired guide (we waited till afternoon hoping for the crowd to disperse a bit) within just 30 mins surrounded by other groups humming constantly around us. It was like in a mall during bargain sale.Do not take me wrong: the palace is really magnificent - there is a lot of gold, amber, marble and expensive wood around and when you add Peterhof, Winter Palace and other near tzar's residences (Oranienbaum, Strelnya...) to it you will easily understand why the bolshevik revolution broke out and succeded in Russia and not somewhere else. But to appreciate it you need to visit in in spring or autum as we were told by the ticket-office clerk. The park on the other hand is relatively quiet and really nice to visit.

It houses the famous Amber Room, which is truly one of a kind. Besides, the Grand Hall is also worth seing. At the same time, you can imagine that this place is very popular and there are always lines to see it. Of all the the places in St Petersburg, this one really needs some arrangement in advance. Otherwise, you'd stand in line for hours and ruin your own impression of it. Here I must say that I'm a representative of a company which can arrange such a visit in advance, but in this review I'm only expressing my opinion, not trying to advertise the company I'm working for.The park is also worth seeing. Don't miss listening to a Russian choir in one of the pavilions, the Grotto, which is situated next to the big lake.You can also enter the Hermitage pavilion, which is interesting from the technical point of view. When it functioned, the guests would go straight to the second floor as they entered, and the servants waited downstairs. When the guests were ready to eat, the table would be lifted up from downstairs already served. All those 200-years old mechanisms are preserved there.If you get impressed with amber and want to buy some, in the palace (to the right from the park entrance) there is a very good amber store with probably the best prices in the area."

The beauty of this palace--and the Amber Room in particular--can almost bring one to tears--especially if you are aware of the history of the mystery of the loss of the original and its whereabouts today. Seeing it is a memory that I will keep always. The Amber Room was the personal highlight of my St. Petersburg visit. Pictures cannot describe the intricacy of the amber mosaics and sculptures in this room..(and you can't take pictures inside it!) A tour to this palace with a guide in high season is a must--we were shepherded past a large group of \"singles\" waiting to enter and guided into a \"back\" door--ahead of the mob--and had the entire palace relatively to ourselves until we reached the Amber Room where we had to wait--but even then, our group of 13 had the room to ourselves for those few precious minutes allotted to our tour group. (glad I wasn't in the group of 40 who were ahead of us!)"

The main highlights of this famous town include the Catherine Palace/Gardens and the Pavlovsk Palace/Gardens. We chose a guided tour with our favorite guide Marina S. Wilson (marinaswilson@st-petersburg-visit.com). The tour is the Imperial Residences: tour of Tsarskoe Selo(Pushkin) & Pavlovsk> about a 6 hr. guided tour with pre-booked entries into both palaces/gardens.The Catherine Palace is amazing with the incredible baroque architecture and design. The famous Amber Room is spectacular, and the rest of the palace is gorgeous.The Pavlovsk Palace is a definite contrast with its exquisite classical style. Both imperial residences reflect the history and architecture of the tsars' private lives.Thrilled that we had the opportunity to have Marina as a guide who is so knowledgeable, and who definitely enhanced our visit."

We took public transport - a walk to Vitebsky Railway Terminal, then a half hour train ride to Pushkin followed by a bus ride (buses ran every 5-10 minutes). A little Russian language knowledge was a definite help although we had friendly help along the way, including being told not to take the private minibus (presumably more expensive). Public transport gave us a little look at suburbia. Unfortunately it rained so some of the outdoor exhibits were closed. The gardens were still worth seeing and of course St Katherine's palace with the spectacular amber room was unforgettable. We were able to get home to the city centre for some shopping in the evening."

It was a lovely autumn day and I was thrilled to see how many Russians were also visiting. The queue was quite long for off season but I think this was due to the weather and all those wanting to get out of the city for the weekend. That said, probably best to visit on a weekday although with a private guide, one does not have to stand in queue.What is most amazing about this building is that it has been painstakingly rebuilt and restored after being extensively bombed during WWII. I find this a testament to the character of the citizens of SPb and their love of and respect for their history. The restoration started during the Stalin era and lasted for decades throughout the Soviet regime. I do not know whether Moscow supported such endeavours or if this was a monumental task set by SPb alone but it is impressive none-the-less and the skilled craftsmen did a fantastic job.After touring the main palace, we walked the grounds where we enjoyed seeing the foliage hats that people were making. Supposedly this an autumn tradition in this area and they are lovely to see. We also had the opportunity to listen to an acappella group of four gentlemen who sang under a vaulted ceiling of one of the buildings on the grounds near the palace. They are extremely talented and even offer a CD to purchase if one so wishes (which we did and it's quite good). Without our guide Natasha, we would never have discovered them.Definitely worth the trip!Hint: make a whole day of it and do not miss Alexander's Palace which is also on the grounds."

Tsarskoye Selo is a Russian city, Puskin about 30 - 40 minutes from Saint Petersburg. This place is an old Imperial city, where the Tzars built palaces and got away from city life. The famous Russian poet, Alexander Pushkin was raised in this city. Still to this day, going to Pushkin is like stepping back in time. When I go, I usually plan for a whole day trip. Go early in the morning to walk the grounds of the palaces. Then go to see the amber room of Catherine's Palace. Then have a stop at Alexander Palace to look at the family life of the last tzar. Pavel's Palace is also worth a visit - especially if you want to understand the amount of damage done during WWII. In late afternoon, take some time at one if the city's cafes. Or do as the Russians do - in the summer, find a lovely place on the preserve and have a picnic. In the winter - take the time to ski or snow board on the grounds. I personally love the city during the winter - the cozy cafes, the steamy delicious borscht, and horse drawn sleds by Pavel's Palace."

It might not boast being beside the sea and it's gardens are not as manicured and engineered but it has a more relaxed character and presents a lusher walk through the park and near the lake. The newly refurbished amber room in Catherine's palace is an impressive demonstration of the opulence of the Russian Monarchy.It costs significantly less than Peterhof, so if you're deciding between the two I'd pick Tsarskoye Selo and its parks and palaces. It's also a lot more accessible from the city by public transport."

Have to admit, that even the palace was almost totally destroyed during World War II, reconstruction teams made the great job and it is hardly recognizable. Reconstructions are still on the way so there are several limitations in the park and palace but it is definitely worth to see / queue.

I understand that it was the residence of the Russian tsars and the main idea of this place was to impress, to astonish, to press with the luxury and greatness. And they succeeded in this. A lot of things are made of gold, gold is everywhere. If you are looking for this, you will be satisfied. I was not. Nevertheless, from the historical point of view it is interesting to visit the place, where important historical decisions of Russian royal dinasty were taken. And I want to add, that what I liked the most in this complex, it was the park. That was really interesting for me, with all geometrically planned lawns, secret places, pathes, settled in rows trees and bushes, pools, ornaments of flowers. That was amazing!"
