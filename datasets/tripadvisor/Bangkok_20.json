            "review": "Cheaper and faster to travel to sites along the river. When I first traveled to BKK, I took taxis everywhere because they were convenient. Many had been good rides where the driver knew where to go without side trips to run up the meter. After several trips where they'd run up the meter, I'd started carrying a card from that destination, a map or have had the desk clerk at the hotel write it down in Thai.After several years I'd discovered the convenience, excitement and low cost of using the commuter ferry. From the Sathorn Taksin ferry landing for the price on only 18 Baht (15 Baht if you buy before boarding) you can travel as short or far as you want to most of the prime tourist attractions near the river at a cost far less than taking a taxi. If it's not along the river, then take a taxi from the landing.Wherever you get off the ferry, you have to walk and walk a lot, typically in the tropic heat and humidity and after you get to your destination, you'll have to walk some more. After 1 or 2 stops, I'm sure you'll be so tired, sore and dripping wet, ready to get back to your room for a refreshing shower. That's now why I suggest you do not use the high priced Tourist Ferry unless you have no concern for cost or you're a glutton for the above and want to max out the ticket."

During the daytime craft of all shapes and sizes ply up and down the river, ploughing through the green weed that abounds, often at unbelievable speeds and seemingly with no regard for Western standards of Health and Safety but also seemingly with no mishaps. A tug will tow three gigantic barges roped together in a line whilst a small leisure boat with a very long propeller shaft tears up and down at breakneck speeds. River ferries take up to 200 or so people at a time from one side of the river to the other, their routes criss-crossing at random. These ferries have no safety rails, gates or doors but noone falls in.At night the barges cease but numerous pleasure boats each laden with hundreds of mainly Western tourists cruise up and down, bedecked with coloured lights, and often with ecstatic dancers gyrating to music unheard from the river bank.Enjoy a meal or a few drinks overlooking this magical river and maybe take a ride on a boat (at least on one of the many ferries) and you will never forget it.Wild and wonderful."

When we got to the pier a really nice guy explained the different tours they offer and how much they were. We opted for the hour and a half tour that goes up the river, through some of the canals, it then stops off at Wat Arun for half an hour and finally takes you back to where you started from. We were on a long tail boat and just the two of us so it is more like a charter. The captin doesn't tell you too much but he did point things out. If was a nice relaxing hour and a half and we only paid 2400 Bhat."

If you don't mind standing in a throng of people and then being herded into a boat during which no one cares if you are old, disabled, or carrying a child they all just want to get on first even though there is assigned seating, then you would like the views on this river's cruises. You see many of the main attractions and the bridges and if you go when sun is setting you get a day and night view of the city and it looks lovely from the water. The food on the boats is awful despite being called an international buffet there was almost nothing I could eat and I am not vegan or have allergies, it was just not good. We were able to get the staff to put a table out on the deck for us where we enjoyed cooler air and a better view while we ate, had this not happened I may have jumped!

We were taken to the river site by a helpful guide, who is obviously on a commission. The boat ride cost us 1000 BHAT each for an hour and a half. We were stocked up with cold water, fruit and bread to feed the fish. Boarding the long boat can be tricky and neither my entry or exit was done with any dignity. That's wasn't helped by a very choppy river, a pontoon that was bouncing up and down and having to climb over a protective siding and down into a moving boat. However, it was worth the undignified boarding. We went down a very choppy river before turning into the canals. Here we queued for about 10-mins to get through the lock. Then we were on our way past a variety of river houses from traditional, to ramshackle to modern. Plus of course a multitude of temples.Life on the river in all its glory. The lazy fisherman. The small river shop owners. People renovating little river houses. The boat sellers with their traditional tourist junk. A very big lizard was glimpsed gliding through the water. The water birds and the endless stream of long boats. Fascinating. Our first stop was Wat Arun. We had around 20-mins to feed the fish (for good luck) and view the temple. Given it was so hot, this was ample time. Our second and final stop was near the lying Buddha. Very convenient. We throughly enjoyed the boat ride. It was good value for money. All in all it was a very enjoyable hour and a half and it afforded us a fascinating view of Bangkok. Such a change from the concrete jungle of the city."

There are several boat tours which you can purchase that act like a taxi/tour guide throughout the Chao Phraya river area. There are also some boats that will take you for free to certain destinations with in the area, but be prepared to wait a long time as several people are in line for these boats. So my suggestion is that you instead use one of the river boat tours boat taxi, they will get you to your destination much quicker & you're not so crowded by others in a boat. The river it self is not very pretty , it's super murky & dark of color too. But what matters is some of the scenery around the river, it's pretty neat. You'll get to see some of the elaborate temples, schools, hospitals & homes in the area. I do recommend that you visit during the night time that's when it's even better. You'll get the nice breeze of the river, & the city really lights up. You'll see several dinner river cruises with lots of cool flashy lights & party's happening as well. But I do recommend for everyone to try this at least once in Bangkok so you get the full experience of seeing the Chao Phraya river & know a bit more of Thailand's culture as well."

If youre feeling lazy and want to just sit and relax whilst seeing the place this is the activity to do (specially during the midday hotness). this will give you nice views of Bangkok's famous temple (Wat Arun) and buildings. I love how this river is so lively and busy."

But be careful with the arrogant boat operators on shore who tries to push you to go on tourist boat for 40THB which is not worth. Take normal orange flag boats to commute which is cheaper and clean. In terms of river, it is not so clean but compare to the city rivers in India it is much cleaner. So enjoy your ride."

But since living in Bangkok, I have grown to love it. It's by far, the best and the most interesting way to travel. Not only will it get you to your destination quickly, it's cheap, dirt cheap (around 7 baht depending on where you want to go) but you will also see evidence of Bangkok's past; European buildings; canals; forts to name but a few. You will also get wonderful views of the city, both on the Bangkok side and the Thonburi side. There are boats available to hire if you want to take a tour of the backwaters and canals, or there are the normal ferry services to take you to wherever you want to go. Either way, don't take my work for it, make sure you travel along the river when you are in Bangkok, you won't be disappointed!"

Coming from the center of Bangkok via the BTS Sapan Taksin is the stop for the pier. There are 2 ferries, one is the local one which is around 40 baht each trip, and the tourist ferry boat which has the blue flag for 150 baht but, it's ride all you can -all day. Seems like a good deal if you are planning on going up and down the river, if you have time might want to just cruise from one stop to the end and come back just to see the sights. But, I also experienced waiting almost 30 minutes for the boat, and by this time the people started to pile up. The river is brownish but doesn't smell and considerably clean. Would also recommend the river cruises which ply at night. Beautiful way to see Thailand via river."

Got to see so much more than tourist stuff, real life happening by the canals that connect to Chao Phraya. Contrasts of gold temples and tiny house shacks. Children playing, boys cutting hair & fishing.Make sure to haggle hard for a better price than they first suggest. We ended up accepting 1200baht for 2 people. A much cheaper alternative would be the Orange Flag ferry takes you to each temple stop at 14 baht per ride. Avoid around 9am & 5pm - it's not the most comfortable at any time though. There is also a Tourist express boat at 190 baht all day ticket. Make sure to wear mosquito repellant by the water."

It's better to board the water taxi that operates as public transport instead of tourist taxi. Its just 14 Baht per person one side and after reaching the last stop I got into return trip to River City pier paying 14 Baht again. By this journey one will get opportunity to mingle with cross section of Thai people including students,working people,young and old and also travellers from around the world.

I chose the 1200 baht cruise rather than the candlelit cruise Canary Travel have on offer because I was on my own and thought the romantic cruise might not be suitable for a single person. I booked online and went to River City pier before the appointed time of 19.30. No problems at all. Great photo opportunities en route especially Wat Arun and Wat Po and Rama 8 bridge.Finished about 10pm and went to Silom for a drink or two at the Irish bar. Great night."

To really experience it you need to stay at one of the many hotels along the river or, at least spend time in a bar or restaurant on a higher floor. We love the Royal Orchid Sheraton...have a look at some of the TripAdvisor reviews.What you see is the life blood of the city....the endless procession of boats going about their daily business. From the numerous ferries to hotel boats, work boats & of course the zippy little longboats with unmuffled car engines hanging off the stern. There's the slow progress of the giant barge trains - often more than four barges towed by what appears to be a tiny tug sometimes with a \"tail-end Charlie\" tug to help control direction.And of course this is just what you see in one view. For a few baht, take a ride in the local ferry to the end of the line. You see life in Bangkok as you won't from anywhere else....the markets, temples, residences & of course, people going about their everyday life. You could take a cruise in a tour-boat or a ride in a longboat if you don't mind getting splashed. Ther are also dinner cruises at night which show the river in a very different light.Yes, for me the Chao Phraya river is Bangkok."

You may go on a tourist boat and that will have the advantages of a commentary about the sights and you will know where to get on and get off.However, I recommend taking the public ferries. Unless you speak and read Thai you will have only a hazy idea of where you are especially if you're like me who had not even prepared by getting the relevant map. I was using a 2 year old Lonely Planet guide with pretty inadequate maps. But it does have the huge advantage of being a splendid adventure.This is because there are different types of boats plying up and down and they follow different itineraries; it would all be much more prosaic if every boat stopped at every pier. But that would be thoroughly European and dull.I got on at Phra Arthit on a boat going south. There was nowhere to buy a ticket. Eventually a lady on the boat sidled up and for 19 baht I was legal. How far this ticket would take me was a complete mystery. This was the time to relax and admire the amazing sights and sounds of the river running through this fascinating city. I had an appointment to make and so I got off at Sri Phraya (I think) and waited to hop on the next northbound ferry.This is where I got slightly caught out. My northbound ferry did not stop at Phra Arthit, where I got on and wanted to return. In fact it stopped at Thewet which was 2 stops north of where I wanted. I walked back to my accommodation which was a fair step; what I should have done was to have taken the next southbound ferry to correct my error. I'll know next time.This is the cheapest and best entertainment and a wonderful way to take in the sights. Don't be be put off by not understanding what's happening, you'll soon get the hang of it, appreciate a break from haggling over prices and you'll get to meet lots of lovely and helpful locals."

A)Tourist Boats (blue): Buy an all day pass for hop on hop off at different piers for 150 baht. A one way trip on a tourist boat without a pass will cost you 40 baht. B)Chao Phraya Express: pay per ride for 14 baht regardless where you get on or off. At busier piers, tickets are sold in line while waiting or buy ticket on the boat. The ticket girls aboard boats really keep track. At most piers there are two docks. Both A) and B) board to the left hand pier. The Tourist Boat (A) is slower and costs more per trip. Chao Phraya Express (B) is faster, cheaper and more fun riding with locals and monks. Hop on whichever one you want.C) Cross river ferries: They go from your bank to the opposite bank.D) Long tail boats: or hire. As a tourist, you have to hire one to get up the few remaining klongs. Tourists never get a chance to hop on the scheduled long tailed boats that the locals use.Both C) and D) tend to leave from the smaller right hand piers.E) Hotel Ferries: All major hotels on the Thonburi side of the Chao Phraya have their own small ferries to transports their guests back and forth across the river. They all stop at Sathorn Pier to access the BTS Skytrain."

I love watching the boats, the never ending trail of boats mainly commercial, plying their trade on the mighty river. I have travelled up to Ayutthaya, a wonderful historic city, 85 km north of Bangkok on the river in a cruise boat and seen the riverside villages, dredging equipment, stockpiles of materials and shanty towns along the river. Been like that for hundreds of years, I was told.I like watching the empty boats being easily pulled by little tug boats on the way up the river and after loading proceeding down river under tremendous load. If you look closely you can see the families on board in the living quarters, with the women cooking for the men folk as meal times approach. It's a hard life, no doubt.The river is used for irrigation, cleaning, clearing and commerce. Night time traffic in the Bangkok area is dinner cruises, as the colourfully lit cruise boats sail up and down several times each night with hundreds of passengers eating, drinking and dancing to both live and recorded music and artists, rain or shine, every night of the week.In the day time, there are many hotel ferries, public transit ferries and jet engine canoe type boats ferrying commuters from side to side and up river. Peak hours are sensational with all the boats I have mentioned, on the river at the same time.It's really worth spending some time on or near the Chao Phraya River and see the history happening before your eyes."

Going into the city was always 'a knife into my heart' - there are extremely expensive hotels, very exclusive restaurants and shops, and there are thousands of beggars.

However keep in mind that there can be quite a rush and you might need to stand in line during rush hours.Also along the river side there are quite a number of hotels, temples and restaurant. One can also have a dinner over the various boats which run in the evening also known as Dinner cruise boats. Once the sun sets down the trip in one of the boats in the river is quite good with the wind hitting your face. I would recommend it a must visit experience."

We booked an evening tour with Thai dance performance and dinner on board. The food for vegetarian food was ok, nothing very special but the dance, the cruise and the evening setting sun over all was very nice. You must do it at least once. Asiatique is also approachable and it is a nice place to be . All these things can be combined and be made into one evening outing. "

Besides of course the thrill of having the cool wind in your face and the spray from the water creating delightful patterns alongside is an added bonus!I would usually take one of the river boats from the Sathorn pier. Each boat has either a yellow/orange/blue or green flag on it which tells you where its going to stop. There is usually a map of the river route on display somewhere on the pier and it would be good to check that first so that you know for sure that the boat you take will stop on the pier you want! The orange flag boats stop at most piers, I think. Tickets are about 15 bhat and can be bought on the boat itself.Using the river boats I could visit Wat Arun, Wat Po, the Grand Palace,the flower market,China Town, Pahurat, Oriental pier, Asiatique and many other places. The river itself is beautiful with so many kinds of vessels plying on it...there are large barges and cruise ships as well as small fishing boats, long tail boats, the river express boats and of course the various ferries which criss cross the river.

I had read some reviews here prior and was ready for the smell and the amount of rubbish and if you can look past that.... it's a great way to see alot of Bangkok. I, like others, boarded at the Central Terminal which is reached from skytrain Taksin station. Previous reviews listed a day trip ticket on the blue boats as costing 120baht, yesterday it was 150baht so I decided to skip that one and use the orange boats. At 14 baht per ride I didn't think I would be getting on and off ten times to justify the blue boat. In the end it was three rides so I came out well ahead.My first stop from the Central Terminal was the Grand Palace area. Very easy to spot, I don't even know the name of the stop (there are two you can use, one before and one after) but the Palace is easily visible and you just get off at the next stop. Didn't actually end up going to the palace, but I did see the reclining Buddha.... pretty cool and absolutely no crowds (a nice peaceful few hours, NOTE feet are still undergoing renovation). I got back on the boat and headed all the way to the end. The scenery is great, wooden houses almost falling in the river, garrishley coloured houses next door and highrises behind. Throw in numerous temples and Buddha statues and well... there is plenty to see! After reaching the end, I got off the boat, bought some candied peanuts and got on the next boat departing. On my way back I had the opportunity to get up close and personal with the giant catfish. THEY ARE ENORMOUS!! and there seems to be thousands if not tens of thousands of them boiling below the surface and coming up for bread thrown in. All in all I can highly recommend a bit of river cruising. It's chilled out, it's a great way to be amused by the chaos of the river and it's cheap! Oh and it's a bit cooler on the river too."

It held their interest and was well worth it. They boat operator tried to charge 3000 baht for one hour, probably because it was low season. When I let him know I had visited Thailand many times and know better, the price became 1200. Be warned also about the floating merchants that paddle out to your long boat. They are friendly, but will charge you 300 baht for one beer. Bring your camera, a bottle of water and make sure you use the bathroom beforehand, then go for a ride on the river.

It can seem confusing at first, but that's half the fun.On the majority of the boats you will pay when you're on board, so don't worry if you can't find anywhere to pay beforehand at your particular stop.Saphan Taksin BTS Skytrain station is a very easy destination to aim for if you're staying in the city \u2013 you can hop on the express boat here which gives you a great overview of the river and can drop you off up the river at Tha Tien, which is the closest for Wat Pho and Wat Arun temples."

There are lots of temples that you can go to using the Chao Phraya express. the One-day pass ticket comes with a guided map of when and where to get off to see what temples. My suggested route would be Wat Pho -> Wat Arun -> Grand Palace for temples. Then at around 4PM you can go straight to Asiatique for a little bit of shopping and end the day at Khao San for food and more shopping"

A trip on the river really gives one an idea of the importance of this river to Bangkok.It can be a tug pulling up to 4 barges filled with metal bars, sand or who knows. Maybe a gaudy tourist boat full of gawping visitors. Always the speedy ferry boats with their distinctive flags of blue, orange, etc distinguishing from which piers they pick up. And then of course the long-tail boats with huge wake shaking everything up as they speed along this highway. In between all this are the local cross river ferries weaving their way from side to side.But it's not only on the river but beside it that one can experience true Bangkok. From Chinatown, try walking down the little side streets & passages to discover hidden temples, shrines & statues overlooking the river.Take one of the cross river ferries to escape from the tourists & wander through a typical street market, discovering fruits you've never seen before. Try Thai specialities like dipping warm, soft bread into smooth, green cream, actually delicious, especially when accompanied with a freshly-squeezed iced lemon juice!That's true Bangkok!!"

Such an interesting ride if you get the chance. Some amazing architecture, incredibly intricate. There are even fish along the way that will come to the surface for a free feed! Haha, everything is for sale in Thailand! Everything has a price. There are quite a few cruises that go up the river that include lunch etc etc. Do make sure you check the prices before agreeing to the trip! Good luck!"

It's not surprising as tens of thousand of people utilize the ferry services on a daily basis. The muddy water may look like there are no ecosystems in it but it's still filled with fishes and maybe some hidden treasures as far back as during the Ayutthaya era.The most busy pier would be at the Sathorn Pier where you'll get 5 local boat lines operated by the Chao Phraya Express Boat Service (Check out the schedule in the photo below). To get to the pier, just disembark at BTS Saphan Taksin and walk towards Exit 2. There will be a sign showing you the direction to those express boats. If you are free for some shopping and dining, there's also the free boat shuttle to Asiatique - The Riverfront."

It's brown! and not what could be called beautiful in the traditional sense, but huge healthy fish abound and there's so much activity, it's wonderful. Breakfast beside the river is a must, and many international hotels line the riverside, with their own beautiful traditional Thai boats ferrying guests to local destinations. Water Taxis are plentiful and of course there are also the 'long tails' if you are feeling adventurous and want to take one for a private tour of the Klongs. (Often the hotels will have their preferred 'long tail' drivers, although these will be at a higher price compared to dealing direct. It must be noted though, that the hotel endorsed tours will be safe and reputable.) Bangkok is a wonderful, colourful adventure every time we go and hopping on boats on the the Chao Phraya River only adds to the experience."

When I was young, I used to travel by Rue Hang Yao (a long motor commuting boat) to get to my secondary school at Satree Wat Rakhang School on the side of Chao Phraya River. We got out from Bangkok Noi Canal near the former Southern Railway Station (Now, a museum) and crossed the River to Tha Maharaj. I always felt small being in the middle of the River. And sure, sometimes I got wet from head to toe because of waves from other boats. This feeling still lingers in my mind when I visited there again last April. Despites modernization along both sides, the Chao Phraya River is still a stunning scene to see and feel. And boat ride across the River from Tha Phrajan to Tha Wang Lang still brings back the memory of my youth, and I still feel small being in the middle of the immense Chao Phraya River."

This is the same market Anthong Boursain ate grilled snakehead fish. So I did the same. Delicious! The tour was colorful and interesting as the houses along the canal were either magnificent or somewhat dilapidated. Really a cool insight into life in Bangkok on the waterways.

The river is very busy - unlike the Thames for example it is used as a major thoroughfare, so everything from longtail boats whizzing by to huge barges trundling along pulled by a couple of pilot boats. Getting on and off both private and public transport boats is a challenge in itself, as the river is quite choppy. You can organise a trip in a longtail boat (with much bargaining !) starting at any river pier and travelling into the canal system where people live right alongside the river in stilted houses. Your boat will stop in a designated spot where there are stalls selling street food and places to sit and eat. This is NOT the floating market though. You have to go by car to get there - about 80km"

They then insisted that we all buy drinks as well as loaves of bread to feed the fish. We didn't really mind as they weren't expensive. Anyhow, the boat driver didn't speak to us all trip even though it was just the 4 of us on the longtail boat. He didn't speak any English and so as a result he didn't point out anything to us along the river - we just tried to guess. Even though we had paid for the hour, the 'tour' lasted only 35 minutes. The driver hurriedly unloaded us at the grand palace wharf -fortunately after a few minutes of stumbling around we were able to work out which wharf we were at.The ride itself was fine and a great way to see Bangkok.

Some luxury hotels along the river side facilitates unlimited free rides for their guests on chao praya. my favorite is the dinner cruise which is a popular attraction for both tourists and locals."

My favourite river trip is taking my young son during a week day public holiday on the express boat from Saphan Taksin Pier (next to the BTS) all the way to Nonthaburi and sitting at the front close to the boat captain. It's far less crowded that during the week days. Get the orange flag boat which is THB 15 all the way, takes about an hour and a half. It stops at the main piers which is part of the fun. Then at Nonthaburi go for a walk about, snacks & drinks and then do the reverse trip back to Saphan Taksin Pier. Or stop off on the way back at one of the sites you liked on the way up. Great restaurants along the riverside to visit as well.There are other commuter boats during rush hour and the working week, also Tourist Boats (blue flag) but they don't go to Nonthaburi and more expensive. My favourite as stated is the orange flag boat.Also at Saphan Taksin Pier you can get the \"free\" hotel boats to all the major riverside 5 star hotels and cross over between them and go and have a walkabout and a drink."

There were water buses, small boats being used as taxis, floating restaurants/nightclubs and also barges carrying in goods and taking out rubbish. We used the river bus as transport when we visited the Grand Palace area. We bought a day ticket which meant we could use the river buses as often as we liked during the day. So, on the return journey, we chose to make a couple more stops and we visited the flower market and China town which are also located near the river. The different stops and different colour flagged boats are a little confusing to start with. To help there are maps at the quayside stops and in the boat which detail where each boat stops and the points of interest located there. If we had had more time it would have been nice to use the boats just as a scenic trip as there were plenty of views and photo opportunities. If you are in a hurry or have to be somewhere at a specific time then bear in mind that this is not the quickest way to travel around Bangkok and allow extra time. It is, however, probably still quicker than braving the traffic jammed streets in a taxi and far more enjoyable."

The Chao Phraya is the main waterway in Thailand, rising in Nakhon Sawan Province, from where it flows nearly 400 km, through Bangkok, to the Gulf of Thailand in Samut Sakhon Province.Historically, the Chao Phraya is very much a \"working\" river, used for transportation, trade and commerce, fishing, and irrigation of rice padi.But for tourists it offers many delights.I first came to Thailand in 1969 and took a small boat trip to the local floating market, which back them was still authentic, with traders eagerly plying their small boats around the klongs (canals) offering their produce for sale. Today tourists are still offered a trip to the floating market, but it is a pale imitation of what it used to be, and is only kept alive by the artificiality of the tourist trade.Again in 1973 I was stationed in Bangkok with the Thai Army and, courtesy of some Thai generals, enjoyed a day long trip on a luxury cruiser up the Chao Phraya to the ancient royal capital of Ayutthaya. Such cruises are still available commercially, and provide an insight into both the river and the riverine communities along the banks, with a visit to the ruins of Ayutthaya thrown in for good measure.Another interesting trip on the river is to catch a ferry across to Koh Kret, about 20 km upsteam from Bangkok. This small island in the middle of the river has been home to a Mon community since the 18th Century when they fled persecution in Burma and were given sanctuary in Siam. They still maintain their old ways and traditions, and if you visit, you must try some of the Mon food which is offered for sale at stalls and small restaurants.If you don't want to go on the river itself, there are many bridges in Bangkok which provide viewpoints of this interesting waterway, including Rama VII Bridge to the north and, seven bridges later, Rama IX Bridge in the south.Currently there are plans afoot by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and the Thai Ministry of the Interior to build a public promenade along both sides of the river, running from Rama VII Bridge seven kilometers downstream to Phra Pin Klao Bridge. But that is something for the future."

There is a whole colour-coded system: fast boats, which only stop at some of the piers, and slower boats, and then a couple of ferry type boats that shuttle back and forth between two piers on opposite sides of the river.It's a great way to get to some of the most beautiful temples (Wat Arun, Wat Pho, etc) and just to see a slice of Bangkok life.

I book a cruise which provided with meals, the meals are awesome, the cruise are clean and it doesn't even feel like you're in a boat, it's like in a 5star hotel, the upper deck served meals and scenery! I like it better at night, since all the lighting will came up, and the pretty silhoutte and golden temples around the river will look amazing. its either you came with a family or your plus one, this experience will gives you such an unforgettable night."

On our second stay we rented an apartment further up the river and decided to take the ferry boats which provide a great regular service. one other alternative is to live a little more dangerously and take a \"long boat\". These bots have what looks like a large diesel engine mounted at the rear with a very long drive shaft connected to it and a propeller attached.. With a roar we are off at what seemed like great speed, and it was. Exciting ... yes. Dangerous ... well a little but we never saw and accidents and it sure is a very quick way to get around and avoid the Bangkok traffic.. many of the temples in Bangkok can be visited this way. Cheap and fast. Just do it."

You can grab a ferry to basically anywhere you want to go it is convenient for catching Tuk Tuk's and taxis to go further into the city.

Our charter took us (at some speed!) to all the main sites and then we stopped at the Floating Market to explore and have lunch. After lunch we toured some of the smaller rivers before the 'driver' dropped us off at the hotel. Highly recommend if you want a chilled out day to see the sites but also parts of Bangkok less travelled. Super!"

You won't have a full appreciation of the city without acknowledging the worth of it's river. Although Chao Phraya seems rather dirty and at times smelly, it is a great way of connecting with the palaces and temples in the old city. Just take a ferry from Saphan Taksin BTS station and you're there in no time, whilst admiring some of the views, like riverside hotels and Wat Arun. Don't use the private boats though, they're far too expensive."

The long tail boats can take you along the small canals off the river to get a glimpse of the local life along the water, however badly impoverished. There are several temples off there and people can be observed fishing ,swimming and hanging laundry.Also along the main stretch of this river a free ferry boat can be taken to Asiatique , a complex of stores and restaurants that offer nightlife along the river, along with a giant Carousel and some smaller rides. A night ride on this free 10 minute ferry also provides a great evening view of the city skyline along this river."

The main historical monuments : The Royal Palace compound, Wat Arun, Wat Pho, and so many others are all along the river. But it is also a living place; a sizable proportion of Bangkokians live at or near the river. It is also where the best hotels of Bangkok (and some of the best in the world) are located (The Oriental, Peninsula, Hilton, Sheraton, etc.) Also many good restauranta and places of significant interest. Bangkok is a mess as far as traffic is concerned. Fortunately, the river traffic is (so far, at least) running much better. So a tourist can come to Saphan Taksin and take many of the boats that ply the river. This is an attraction in itself, but is also a smart way to visit historical Bangkok."

We stopped at a fish feeding area, where the owners charge for bread to feed the fish. A single woman in a canoe glided out into the middle of the river for which we stopped again. She tried to convince us that she was a true representation of the famous floating market outside Bangkok. No sale as everything was western prices. The houses built on stilts were interesting. If you have a high speed camera, you will get some good photos. Phone camera shots all resulted in blurry pics.

There are a lot of Temples to see including Wat Arun, Temple of Dawn. I even took in the Holy Rosary Church, a distinctive sight in this predominantly Buddhist country. A unique experience was making a stop where the captain obtained some bread for me to throw out to the fish for good luck. The fish were voracious and ate every bit of the rolls that I tossed them! Images of the King and Queen were also featured prominently at points along the river.It was also interesting to see some of the connected canals. I particularly enjoyed seeing a huge lizard that was lounging along the water. On a hot day in Bangkok, it was nice to be on the water!I highly recommend hiring a small boat to enjoy the river. A reputable captain will be able to provide interesting insights into sites along the river and really enhance your trip along this special river in Bangkok."

Many local Thais and even tourists are using the river as a route for transportation. Many heavy cargos are being shipped down stream from upcountry to Bangkok. There are many canals linking with the river which offer unique sightseeing into rural life along the canal. However the best to observe the Chao Phraya River is to find a front row seat at a riverside hotel and watch the life along the river. It is fascinating and wonderful sight."

We were then taken to a boat place and they tried to do us for 3000 baht, we haggled down to 2000 baht for 2 to ride in a boat that splashed us with the dirty water of the river. Mistake 2.They did take you near various sites but you didn't have a clue what they were and to be honest, from the boats it's not a great view. They also took you to a laughable floating market with an old lady selling tat from her dinghy. As a last gasp when no one was buying her rubbish, she asks you to buy a drink for the person driving your boat, everyone declined and then the driver hands the old lady a whole load of drinks, clearly previously scammed tourists!!! Finally it was a ride over to a pier near Wat Pho where they charged us 5 baht per person to disembark. Mistake 3. Wish I had read the reviews here first. I can't help but feel there are a lot of tourist traps in Bangkok. Be wary. It's a costly mistake."

Taking the ferry with the orange flag which cost 13 Baht for each ride regardless of the distance travelled was a very good way to go from one place to another. You cannot get lost using it as it will bring you back to BTS Saphan Taksin and you can take the skytrain back to where you came from.The Mae Nam Chao Praya River is obviously intended to be a mode of travel rather than a touristy clean river to \"behold\", like some of the rivers in other parts of the world. The touristy part of it is that most of the people I saw travelling on ferries up and down were tourists.I suppose the locals know how to get from one place to another using short cuts on land, or by bus, which we did not know."

You can see how the families live their lives and an insight into the calmer atmosphere of Bangkok. You can seen many of the sights from the water (Wat Arun) and others are just a short stroll from the river (Grand Palace). It's amazing to watch the little ferries, which cross the river from one side to the other. There are also boats offering dinner cruises. I can highly recommend that you do this once. Only one thing is bad that small canal have very bad and dirty smell."

The best way to find at least 3 top cultural and sacral places, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, and the grand palace. Just take the orange boat, and Wat pho and grand palace are at the same side of the river. You'll find Wat Arun (Temple of down) is just opposite side of Wat Pho. Orange line is cheaper than the boat of tourist, but also less crowded and more symphatic. You also can travel up to the end of the town or just until the Kro Kret Island, or just to Nothaburi, where you'll find a very good market with some nice food stalls. You 'll find several types of boats, orange flag is the best to use. Take a boat also in the evening, very nice to see the lights of this fantastic town. Even if you are only for 2 days here, don't miss the river."

I have done the Chao Phraya river trips many times and it doesn't matter how many times I do them, they are always a clear high pointThere are 2 types: 1) The standard commuter boats 2) Private rentalThe standard commuter boats are very very cheap. Go down to The Oriental Pier (by Oriental Hotel at the end of Silom Rd) and take the commuter boat to Nonthaburi, it's only 24 Baht something one-way and you will hardly have to wait longer than 20 minutes for one. Avoid rush hour when people go to work or finish their jobs of course, best is to go in the morning after rush hour and make it more than a half day tripThe trip takes an hour or so and you get to see the whole Chao Phraya River, once in Nonthaburi, have lunch and take another boat back again. It's really interesting and absolutely amazing how much you get to see for so little money. The commuter boats stay on the big river and does not go into the smaller canalsThe private boats: They are also very interesting but of course much much more expensive. Watch out for that they negotiate the price for two people before the trip and then claim it's a misunderstanding and wants pay for each personYou get to go into the smaller canals and it's a superb experience, it really really is. It's a bit of the old Bangkok and quite unforgettable. Although expensive, I can highly recommend that you do this once"

It provides transport to countless Thais every day going to and from home, it ferries people across the river, it carries large barges toting all manner of goods, and it's still home to many people whose wooden dwellings are still standing after years and years. You can hop on a ferry and travel up and down for miles and miles. The ferries with orange flags come by every 10 minutes and they cost only a few baht. If you see something interesting, hop off and explore. Then get back on again. The kids will love the novelty of being on a boat. Just be sure to keep your mouth closed if you sit on the outer seats as the boat waves can get quite high, and before you know it you've got a mouthful of dirty water! That said, it's much more relaxing that sitting in a cab stuck in traffic for hours. Just be sure to get off before peak hour or you will be jammed in like sardines with all the commuters going home.There are more and more complexes with restaurants and bars appearing on the river banks now, which makes it easier to find a nice spot to park yourself for a few hours.At night time it's great to sit and soak in all the lights along the river, and smile at the massive disco karaoke boats that are constantly passing. The River City complex has a number of good bars and restaurants, and there are also other complexes further up the river towards the Khao San Rd area. I haven't tried these as they are fairly new and I didn't get the chance on my last trip.You can also choose any one of the 5 star hotels on the river and enjoy a drink al fresco or in one of their bars. Hotels line both sides of the river and they have their own boats that will ferry you across for no fee. There's also the Asiatique complex up river, which has a special ferry that will take you there from the Saphan Taksin pier.The river by day is interesting once you get past the murky colour, but at night time it really does come to life and you see it in all its finery. If you're ever in Bangkok for the Loy Kratong festival in November, the river is the best place to be to see all the boats, fireworks and people out floating their kratongs in the water. You have to book well ahead though as this is one of the most popular events of the year."

Great way to make your way towards the Grand Palace, Chinatown, and other points such as Khao San road area. You also get a nice breeze travleing along the river which is refereshing on some of those very hot days. The river boat will take you to places where the BTS and MRT do not go which is a huge benefit. Take the BTS train to the Sathorn Pier stattion and byut your ticket there. Yoy can also hop on the boat at any of the stops aling the river and buy tickets there or pay on board. Just pay attention to when oyur stop is coming up because the boats do not stop for very long So it's quick on and quick off..If you are delayed getting off the boat you may miss your stop (that happened to me once)."

They whistle loud in your ear and yell at you! They even ripped us off a couple times. They stir you away from what you're looking for to what they want you to buy (tours and boats). Its shocking that in such a busy tourist location, they would be so unfriendly and scamming. Without the tourism, they would have no money! Anyway, bad experiences.

That said, lurking in the river (and neighbouring Klongs) are gigantic monitor lizards. These things aren't quite as big as Komodo Dragons, but big enough to have people screaming.

Tired out from exploring the market we just wanted to hop on board a boat which could take us on a slow round trip around the river. On arrival at the ferry terminal we were told we had to buy the multi-pass to hop off and on when we wanted. After letting them know we didn't want to hop off and we just wanted to cruise with the ferry, we were still told we needed to get an expensive multi pass instead of a single ride ticket.We passed on the whole boat ride because of the ridiculousness of the ferry operation. I would advise hiring your own boat if just looking for a simple cruise on the river.Also, the river itself is quite dirty and may be a disappointing sight of you're a nature lover."

There are still a number of klongs (canals ) that run off the river to homes and businesses. The \"Venice of the east\" was probably an apt name before the car took over and many canals were filled in.The ferries provide mass transport for many thousands of commuters and tourists daily. It's a great way to escape the traffic and visit some of the city's attractions such as Wat Arun.

It's around 1000baht for having complete boat to yourself. The scenery keeps on surprising you. You might also come across a stray boat selling souvenirs. Getting a drink for your boat guy is regarded as good gesture. The route is dotted with places of interest. You also get to soak in the unique Thai architecture along with the humdrum of regular life. There are safety vests on the boat. On request, your boat guy can give you an adrenalin rushing experience by converting the boat ride into a boat race."

Stay focused and all will be fine.We went as far north as Nonthaburi, which is the 3rd last stop. Costed just 17baht.

During a recent stay in Bangkok I took one of the river ferries daily, to various sights such as National Museum, Chinatown and Siriraj Medical Museum. Get a good map showing the ferry stops before you set out; if you're not sure where to get off, all the ferry staff know which stop goes to which sight. Take the Skytrain to Taksin station and just hop on any of the ferry boats going upriver (to your right as you face river). We discovered by chance that the commuter boats (that don't have a guide talking on a microphone) are much cheaper - only 18 baht compared to 40 baht for a \"guided\" ride. The guides are very hard to understand anyway so you are not missing anything by taking the cheaper boat. Also, you do not need to buy a ticket in advance if there is big line at the booth ... just hop on and a lady will come by and you can buy a ticket on the boat. Somehow she remembers who has paid and not paid even though dozens of tourists get on and off at each stop. The sights along the river are fascinating - you see the skyline, temples, fancy hotels, floating businesses and working boats passing by. Especially at sunset with a breeze going, it is a beautiful and relaxing ride affording many photo ops. Many of the ferry stops are also interesting in themselves, with markets you walk through en route to sights, including the Flower Market and Amulet Market. Do not leave Bangkok without taking this ride at least once."

Like Venice, Bangkok's Chao Phraya river is very much a working artery of the city. All kinds of water craft ply the waters in all directions. There are different levels of water taxis, express and local; there are also some specially for tourists which cost a lot more and there are smaller taxis for the smaller canals and then there are the long tail boats (think Venice gondolas) for tourists to glide along the smaller canals and see life along the shoreline. We were fortunate enough to experience all of them in the space of just two days in Bangkok. We could never have done this without the expert guidance of Swai, our guide from YourThaiGuide.com. We chose to travel exclusively via public transportation so as to avoid traffic congestion. A wonderful side benefit was that we got to 'do' Bangkok like a native.Swai would collect our money and buy our tickets and then we would wait for the ferries with everyone else. What an amazing adventure! Getting on and off on the Chao Phraya river ferries is not a problem at all. We did also venture out on the ferries of the smaller canals and those were very interesting. You must step on the side of the boat and then step down into it! There is a long tarp on the side running the length of the boat which is pulled up when the boat is moving to avoid spashback and wake from other boats. These smaller ferries barely stop long enough for people to disembark and embark so there is no room for slip-ups, pun intended. The main historical sites such as the Temples are along the river so taking the ferry is almost essential. Who needs the traffic of the roadways? You can also cross the river by ferry boat. The river is lined with businesses, hotels, temples, homes, apartment buildings and is constantly teeming with people. The skytrain connects to the ferry at one point so getting around can be pretty seamless if you know your way or have an expert local guide. Ours took us to three temples, to the Royal Barge Museum, Jim Thompson house and Asiatique, all by boat. Highly recommended!"

Most riverside hotels has a free riverboat to central pier. You can then choose Tourist Boat (1 day 150 bhat or 40 Bhat per trip or get local boats. 15 Bhat per trip) . Watch which local boats stop at which pier,, (done via Color Coded lines with Boats having colored flag flying).Wat Arun, Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Flower Market all are accesible easliy by boat. You can also get a Long tail boat (1500 bhat per 6 pax..- full boat, for some Klong-(canal) tours to see some local views) .Come evening a free boat to Asiatique night market will start and run till mid night. If not at riverside hotels. then Central Pier is easily accesible by Saphan Taksin BTS ."

The boat basically had a car engine attached to the rear. Once the motor was engaged, its horsepower lifted the prow of the boat above the water and we were off. The river shows Bangkok's past and present. Makeshift shanties with docks jut out into the water harkening back to a time when people lived off the bounty the river offered. Now the river is filled with floating garbage and remnants of things tossed away and abandoned. Rising above both banks are towering office buildings and hotels. The natural beauty of the river provides a naked glimpse of Bangkok's dilemma -a mix of extreme poverty and great wealth existing side by side."

Sites you can go to using Thai method: wat pho temple, Chinatown, and the grand temple. Second option is to take a private or semi private tour in the river. I ended up paying about 750 baht after negotiations for a one hour tour. Beautiful thing about it is that you actually go off the main river into small water alleys and between houses etc which is a fun experience. One boat even approached to sell souvenirs calling itself a floating market haha. Whichever way you choose to explore the chao phraya river: do it! And enjoy!"

There are lots of piers along the way to stop at and reach all the tourist spots. When you get to a pier just be aware that there are tourist boats and local boats. When you are at the pier it looks like the tourist boat is the only one available but that is not the case - just ask someone where the local boat goes from (we got caught out this way). The local boats are cheaper (14baht one way), but the tourist boat (40 baht one way or 150 baht unlimited travel for between certain piers) is nicer and has a guide up front giving information about sites and stops."

Some sites include Wat Pho, Palace, Khao San Road and Asiatique. To get to Wat Pho, Palace or Khao San Road, the most enjoyable and cheapest way is to take the BTS train to Saphan Taksin station and then take the ferry from there (2 min walk to ferry Terminal) for just 40 bahts (less than $2). The ferry ride is enjoyable, has a tour guide and you can get off at any of the several places on the way (restaurants, malls and historical sites). I would recommend getting off at the terminal by Wat Pho and visit Wat Pho and area. You can then get back on the ferry and go to Asiatique in the evening and enjoy some nice restaurants, artifact stores, massages and desserts. From Asiatique to BTS there is a free ferry."

There are numerous ferries on the river ,making sight seeing very easy ,lots of temples are on the river as well as royal barges ,skytrain also stops by river , making access to shopping very easy .We tried a canal trip , which was great as you can see all the local riverside properties ,the trip we did had to access the canals by massive locks which was fun .Be wary of floating traders as even after a bit of bartering are not cheap and if your on a local boat be cautious when they stop on the river as there is normally a tuk tuk driver lurking ready to take you to a tailor or jeweller . A pleasant way to spend a few hours ."

It was difficult to obtain help in English on the routes and tourists are charged 40 baht per person on a blue flag boat vs. 14 baht a person when you take a local orange flag boat. The difference is there is a \"guide\" on the blue boat that speaks in English (which you can't hear cause it's loud). The exhaust fumes from the boat is also overwhelming, causing my skin to break out and rashes to form. The drop off and pick up methodology is also very concerning as one false move and you can end up in the polluted river. We had no other viable choice but to take this boat/ferry thing."

These are not small business man, they're more like games who run the fastboats on the river. Be careful of any taxi driver that tells you they will take you to the river taxi or ferry piers. they might say \" there is a lot of traffic , it would be easier to go by River.\" What they will do is take you to one of the private piers for the fast tail boats. Once there, you will get the aggressive hard pitch sale. The taxi driver who brought you there , would of course get his cut. There are also \"crews\" that will sell you a ride at some of the ferry and taxi piers. If you use those, you have to negotiate the price well in advance and even then there's a good chance they're going to be asking you for a big tip after.

You can rent the boats for a few hundred baht for an hour or more. For a more relaxed trip with a destination, take one of the many ferry boats that go up and down the river to the temples and tourist areas. The mix of ancient and ultra modern along the river make for some great pics. Should see it in the day, but the night lights make it very memorable.

But what we highly recommend is renting a Longtail boat for an hour or two and going through all the back canals. Whenever we have guests in town we ALWAYS do this and it is always great---and the photos are fantastic as are the visual memories. And it's only about 800 to 1000 baht (cheaper depending on how you book it) for a private tour... I can't recommend this enough, and it's so inexpensive too. We recommend doing it in early morning or later afternoon when light on the river is beautiful---it's a bit more harsh and humid mid day."

Whenever I have friends briefly passing through Bangkok and they ask what they should do for a day I never hesitate in recommending a ferry trip along the Chao Phraya River. Most people would begin their trip by taking the BTS Skytrain to Saphan Taksin BTS Station and walking directly to the ferry pier just a few meters away - so easy! For just Thai Baht 14 (US 40 cents) you can travel from Taksin to Nonthaburi Pier spending about an hour viewing Thai, Chinese, and European historical buildings, river vessels of all types and life along the banks as it's been for decades. There are many convenient stops en route so if you wish to visit the Grand Palace simply disembark at Tha Chang Pier, or Phra Athit Pier to visit Phra Sumen Fort and have lunch in many of the trendy restaurants along Phra Athit Road and nearby Khao San Road. There are plenty of maps available to plan your trip and if you are visiting several attractions along the river it may be cheaper buying the Baht 150 day pass rather than paying Baht 14 each time you board for your next trip.The regular ferries which the local Thais use can get very crowded so grab a seat as quickly as possible so you can enjoy the experience in comfort. Definitely more fun than dragging yourself through shopping malls, markets and the infamous Bangkok traffic!"

When we tried to ask for the cheaper ticket the ticket woman was very rude and kept ignoring us. Luckily there was another man manning the pontoon who was very friendly and resolved the situation. If using the river ferry, which is great to see many of Bangkoks main tourist attractions I would recommend looking to see how many stops you will make and which different coloured lines (flags) are running on the day as you can get tickets for much cheaper than paying 40bhat single trip or paying for the full day tourist ticket."

Yet fish seem abundant, and conversely, there is so much vegetation that the river authority has a number of dredgers / yellow mechanised weed collectors (is this water hyacinth ?). And, of course craft of all sizes including huge barges being slowly towed by what seems to very underpowered tugs.

It's a magical one hour tour not to be missed!The waterway is the way to travel without the hassles of cabs, tuk-tuks, traffic and crazy crowds.NOTE: The tourist/taxi boats stop running at 8pm! The schedule changes so be sure to ask!"

Even though Bangkok has increasingly good mass transit, the river is still the best way to reach many of its main sites and neighbourhoods. There are places to relax along its shores, though these are increasingly being edged out by big money developments, (they know the best place to be!) you can still find cheap places to eat and drink and watch the sun go down over a Wat in Thonburi. And best of all, for a cool climate denizen like me, the air by the river is cooler in temperature, and usually has a good breeze blowing. Numerous boats offer tours, or a five minute crossing, but the Chao Phraya river boats are a great deal for about 50 cents and can take you a long way up or down stream."

It's pretty impressive as you go along the Chao Phraya, the skyline & building are awesome. The river is s busy place, lots of traffic, I'm surprised there are no accidents. There was a lot of debris in the river. The boat felt steady which is a bonus if your the sickly type, however when you do disembark it can be a bit scary due to the rocking of the boat.

We were just traveling to the major boat landings so we decided to take the boats with orange flags. Going upriver at 2 pm, the boat wasn't too crowded. And we wondered why so many people used boats with blue flags at Baht 150 ($4) per trip instead of the orange-flagged boats at Baht 15 (40 cents). At 4 pm we soon understood the reason. The orange-flagged boat going downstream was full to the gills, and we sardined in with everyone else. It sure felt good when we reached our destination. The blue-flagged boats were not crowded at 4 pm. Next time during rush hours, we would gladly pay the Baht 150 for a place to sit and enjoy the view and the breeze."

This is where you realize why you needed all the medical shots. Some of the most exotic scenery in East Asia; and only a few miles from Bangkok but so different. Look for the stunning flowers that adorn houses along the river. This is the reason you traveled here."

Chao Phraya river is a great way to travel to most of the places of interest in Bangkok.The Chao Phraya tourist day pass (150 bhat) is great if you plan to visit a few places in a day. Otherwise a single trip usually costs 40 bhat. The Chao Phraya tourist boat (marked with blue flag) is furnished with large seats, and good English MC introducing the places of interests for each stop. If you are more adventurous, you may board the boats with orange flags (cheaper, more local crowd, smaller seats and more stops).At the piers, beware of touts offering boat tours along the river. They quote as much as 2000 bhat for one-hour boat ride which is exhorbitant! Buy Chao Phraya express boat tickets at official counters.A good place to start is from the Sathorn Central pier (next to Saphan Taksin BTS station) and take Chao Phraya Express Boat to various key tourist spots -a) Ratchawongse pier (N5) for Chinatownb) Tha Tien pier (N8) for Wat Pho (temple of reclining Buddha) and Wat Arun (temple of dawn) across the river.c) Tha Chang pier (N9) for Grand Palace, Wat Phra Keow (temple of emerald Buddha) and National Museumd) Phra Pin Klao Pier (N12) for Royal Barges National Museum"

Take some bread with you to feed them, as these fish are enormous and go into a complete feeding frenzy next to the boat! There are hundreds of them and it's quite a sight! You will also come across one or two local floating river vendors along the route who will row up to the boat to sell their wares, whether it be touristy gifts or drinks. They are happy to barter with you and sell some very nice gifts. Going by boat just gives you a totally different aspect of Bangkok and a very enjoyable trip."

The lowland areas of the Chao Phraya watershed in central Thailand have been designated as the Chao Phraya freshwater swamp forests, a tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ecoregion,[13] an area about 400 km (249 mi) north to south and 180 km (112 mi) wide.The original swamp forests have almost entirely been removed as the plain has been converted to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including a large number of fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), and the sarus crane (Grus antigone)[14] and animals such as tigers, Asian elephants, Javan rhinoceroses, and the much-hunted Schomburgk's deer.[15] Today we can only estimate a description of the original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area would have consisted of freshwater swamps inland and salty mangroves on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in Phragmites marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, a relic of the original landscape.As so much has been cleared or altered the potential for creating large protected areas to preserve original habitat no longer exists. However much wildlife does remain in the rice fields and steps may be taken to preserve these as urban and industrial development on the plains is ongoing and the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand has very little control or planning over this. Particular threats come from the conversion of rice paddies to large-scale production of prawns by pumping in seawater, and the use of pesticides to eliminate the introduced snail,Pomacea canaliculata, which damages rice plants.There are populations of threatened birds, including colonies of breeding water birds such as the world's largest populations of the near-threatened Asian openbill (Anastomus oscitans), and other birds such as the wintering black kite (Milvus migrans). Endemic mammals that remain are the limestone rat (Niviventer hinpoon), Neill's long-tailed giant rat (Leopoldamys neilli), and the near-endemic Thailand roundleaf bat (Hipposideros halophyllus).The Chao Phraya basin is home to about half a dozen endemic dragonflies and damselflies; the conservation status of most of these in unclear (they are rated as data deficient by the IUCN), but Cryptophaea saukra is critically endangered and Caliphaea angka is endangered.[16]There are few areas of wetland protected as national park and these are mostly very small."

We were particularly intrigued by the huge barges that were pulled slowly by the tugs up and down the river.The local ferries are a very cheap source of transport for visiting many of the major tourist sights, and though they sometimes look quite chaotic, they work very efficiently.The river at night is quite magical with the reflections of the lights, and the numerous gaily lit restaurant boats travelling along the river. Travelling along the river is a unique experience as the traveller will see many very humble wooden or corrugated iron shanties on stilts, alongside modern buildings and even golden temples."

Simply hop on board one heading in the right direction and pay for the ticket on board.Be sure to check the maps at the pier so you know which pier you need to exit because there are no announcements on board.You can also use the tourist boat which is 150 baht flat rate for unlimited daily travel or 40 baht each way. This boat does give commentary about what to access at each pier but only stops if someone wants to get on or off. Pier 8 is the main one for the Grand Palace and Wat Arun.I also went for a 1 hour trip through the canals on the long tailed speed boats. This was exhilarating when they went fast but was great too going slow and seeing monitor lizards basking in the sun and getting into the back canals where the locals live.This so reminded me of Venice but instead of a gondolier it was on a crazy speed boat.Some places are regulated speed boat places and they charge a little more.I got mine from the dock at pier 8. As I am a solo traveller I told them I wanted to wait for others to come and join me to share the cost. We ended up with 5 of us and only costing 500 baht an hour.This ricer seems to be the soul of Bangkok and I really feel you are missing out if you don't give river travel a try."

Cheapest way is to take the public ferry, easiest point of access is via Sathorn pier (connects to Saphan Taksin BTS stop) or free ferry ride to Asiatique (usually very long Qs). There are also numerous privately operated dinner cruises on offer.The river is a hive of activity during the day but all private cruises only operate at night. Most affordable dinner cruise is the one operated by The Riverside Hotel.Frankly, theres nothing much to see at night on the river except for the magnificent Wat Arun all lighted up like a diamond. Asiatique is a must-see, best to go early, before sunset, before the crowds. Theres an excellent Thai restaurant by the pier. Many other shops, eateries, fish spa, ferris wheel, to keep U entertained.My favorite river activity is to partake of afternoon tea at the Shangri-La hotel (Exit at Saphan Taksin BTS station) - enjoy the scones and tea while watching the boats go. This is living! This is (affordable, 5 star) Thailand!"

Even just take single tour for 40 baht to another stop or cross river for 3 baht to see wat arun you will be charmed by this city. Do not take tours -all day 150-500 baht ! So before travelling check out for routes ; ticket is single or return and how many hours you will spend \u0131n that station otherwise your daily ticket is not worth. We got single and under sunshine had amazing photos of local river-side thai houses, wats, towers, hotels and shopping malls like \"river city\". River is so muddy and full of floating plants. Even its raining these boats ara long ; one row 9 people be seated ; and a guide tells you about skyscapers, towers, wats, shopping malls around river. Tickets are green for one way and 40 baht ; \u0131f you found cheaper 3 baht ; you re just allow to cross the river in a boat or higher price means return but gives you to stop anywhere you want and take on again till 6 pm. Another useful tip check out last hour of boat ; you may end in a pier waiting for never-coming-boat :) actually all day ticket is just useless ; you may walk piers and \u0131t is fun. You will discover amazing sides of Bangkok while walking ( you must bring umbrella for sunshine !)"

You will get to see the modern Bangkok directly in front of you in direct contrast with the older more traditional Bangkok behind you if you get the boat from around Khao San (Phra Arthit pier) to Tha Thien pier (opposite Wat Arun). It seems a little daunting at first but it couldn't be simpler to use. There are a few different lines to choose from (white, blue or orange if I recall correctly) we used the Orange line (the boats have orange flags on them). The reason for this is because the orange boats go to every stop, if you have a map / phone app you'll be able to see exactly where you are and know which stop to get off at. Although you do get plenty of time for this as there are big signs on the pier and they take a minute or 2 to get the boat close enough to the pier for people getting on and off. You pay on the boat to a person who comes round and you simple tell them where you are going and they charge you accordingly (the trip from Phra Arthit to Tha Thien was 28 baht per person)A helpful tip is if you have sunglasses / hat please hold on tight the ride can be slightly bumpy / windy!"

Some of the highlights are Wat Arun, Grand Palace, Khao San Road, plus tourist area around there, the flower market, etc. You can also use this route to connect to the BTS at Saphan Taksin station. Though sometimes bus routes get you there faster. There are also cross river ferries, that just cross the river at different spots. Overall, its a neat experience, plus beautiful at sunset, and night time, though most ferries finish running at 7 PM. CAREFUL GETTING ON AND OFF THE BOAT!"

The Chao Phraya River is a fairly large and very busy river that runs thru a good portion of Bangkok making accessibility to many sights and attractions more convenient and provides a very economical transportation option. There are also many public and sometimes hidden areas along the river that offer fine photo op's, or just sit and relax watching the river traffic glide by. There are hundreds of passenger boats that ply the waters daily and the most economical tend to be the yellow flagged commuter boats on which you can travel over long stretches of the river for only dollars a day that run often thru out the day. Of course departure and arrival times are mere suggestions and schedules are changed frequently depending on demand and at peak times can be dangerously overloaded. Pay for individual trips to specific landing docks once on the boats or prior to boarding if there is no ticket stand. There is also a very economical day pass on which you can travel to your hearts content! In addition there are any number of \"better equipped\" tourist boats for ever increasing fees. Very large party boats also offer river trips and can offer food as well as entertainment. These are very popular at night. The river itself is constant muddy brown and it is not unusual to see large mats of water hyacinths or trash floating by. You are strongly advised not to enter the water as it can be quite polluted so also avoid being splashed while on the boats."

There are also other boats with a orange flag on the top that for a bit more take you further ahead in the river which allows you to get a broader view of the city from the river . Bear in mind that the orange flag boats are not private tours. They are public . You can buy the tickets on board . These boats do get crowded easily , so pay attention to your belongings.However if you do want a private tour , for instance , to go to the fishing village there are plenty to choose from at each port but be very , very careful with the tour you choose. Don\u00b4t hesitate to negotiate to get a good deal and to avoid being ripped off . Be aware that we noticed that in the same operator in different days we were shown a price list with very different prices from what we had seen the day before. if you get a quote somewhere from 400 to 500 bath for two persons take it. dont spend much more than that on this sort of tours"

We asked the hotel receptionist for directions around old Bangkok, and they were really helpful to guide us with all necessary details and a map.And we took off, admiring the many shops on the way and after making our self a quick coffee and ready to eat noodles easily available in the departmental store. Within 10 minutes of walking we reached the Chao Phraya River side. The hotel guys were so helpful in advising us to not take a tuk-tuk (local 3 wheeler transport) which would cost us around 100-150 thai baht, and instead go via the quickest and cheapest transport, the ferry which hardly cost ur around 10 thai baht. Not only that the ferry ride is too beautiful. The river side if full of big fishes which is amusing to watch.Imagine yourself in a ferry and any direction you see there is heritage and tradition and the culture of the Bangkok. The ride itself seems like an attraction. One of the local guys helped us identify the ferry with a reddish orange flag as the one that would take us.Read full article on:http://ghshart0.wix.com/ourlittletravelbook#!One-night-stand-with-Bangkok/cmbz/55c0f7380cf265ef515e4d66"

The means of transportation here are almost machine boats and canoes, and riverine residential shelter is stilt house along every canals. One of the most interesting activities that impressed me much is to feed the swarms of catfish in a certain distance by breads. They are friendly and naturally eat things we fed. For the spiritual thought, people here doesnt catch these fishes. The floating transport give a hand to enlarge the variety of trafficle mean in Bangkok as well as a lively attraction to the tourists through out the world.

On its way to the Gulf of Thailand, the chocolate-brown watercourse moseys through Bangkok.To experience the mighty Chao Phraya we took the BTS Skytrain to the riverside Saphan Taskin station, where several river cruise options are available at the nearby Sathorn Central Pier. With limited time and a desire for a less touristy more authentic experience, we boarded the orange-flagged boat, which lacks English narration and stop announcements, but only costs 15 Bhat (US$0.43) for any length ride. We purchased our tickets from the pier-side stand, but could have paid the onboard ticket-taker just as easily.With capacities of up to 120 passengers, the wooden, single-screw boats, complete their 26-mile (42 km) round-trip circuits from Wat Rajsingkom (S3) to Nonthaburi (N30) and back. We cruised north to the Tha Thien pier (N8), and visited nearby Wat Pho and its magnificent Reclining Buddha. Then, for 3 Bhat (US$0.09), we crossed the river on a covered raft-like ferry to the Thonburi west bank to admire Wat Arun and the Temple of the Dawn. After returning by ferry to Tha Thien pier, we looked back over our shoulders across the Chao Phraya to watch the sun set behind Wat Arun and its world-famous spire, colorfully illuminated against the glowing horizon. As night fell, the river boats ceased operation (7:30 pm daily), leaving us on our own to mosey the meandering streets of Bangkok."

Be sure to take the correct coloured flag if you are going to a specific location. Otherwise, if you have time to spare and feel like exploring, just hop on to a ferry and alight when you feel like it! Also, before alighting, be sure to be ready standing at the drop off area of the ferry, they will not allow you to alight once they start to move off."

The transport system up and down the river is excellent and extremely cheep and definately the way to travel. Unfortunately the river its self is filthy and all the numerous canals stagnent, full of sewage and extremely smelly. The canals require to be dredged to flow again, the sewage requires an infastructure system that stops the majority of the cities sewage hitting the river and the people themselves must take more responsibility and not use it to despose of their waste. The river has such a magnificant potential in this vibrant city and i really hope they put in the effort to get it right"

The first ride for the main visiting point (from the station of Saphan taksin) cost 40 baht for one way. Then you can find an express boat only cost 3 or 15 baht. So if you insist to visit every pier, you must get the one day pass. But i suggest you spend more time to each area at least 1-2 hours, so you don't need this.And don't forget to wait at one of the pier which can enjoy the sunset. The day i stay at the river walk, sunset with rainbow color..The view was stunning! If you stay at some of the hotels near the pier. You will have free ride to the main area. So lets have fun~~"

Best if you get on up stream from Tha Tien, Tha Change, the area around the Grand Palace, you can probably get a seat. Try getting on at Tha Thewes for example. There is also a local restaurant overlooking the river, right next to the ferry pier \"In Love\"A riverboat with an orange flag will take you all the way to Saphan Taksin, which is below the Oriental Hotel pier and it will cost all of 15 Baht."

Highly recommended for visiting places like The Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, Emerald Buddha, China Town, Thonburi Railway station. There are different type of boats and ferries, Ferries are usually used for crossing the river from one bank to the other and costs no more than 5 Baht. Chao Phraya express boats are used to travel up and down the river to visit various places along the river.There are different type of boats - no flag, orange flag, green flag.... - thorough detail is given in Bangkok.com site. Orange is high recommended for travel up and down the river becoz it runs on all days, stops at most of sites you want to visit, the ticket person on board speaks English and will guide you properly, costing just about 15 Baht per trip. Frequency is 20 mts. During peak hours it will be crowded.Thonburi station to take a train to Kanchandburi, Bridge on the river Kwai is 5 to 10 minutes walk pier N 11Grand Palace and Wat Pho near pier N 9.China Town is close to the river too though many use the MRT also to reach it.Take a boat ride from one end to the other in an Orange flag boat just for the thrill of it. you will enjoy the ride.If you want to visit and ride through the several canal there are private boats for hire. You will have to bargain. They will take you out for an hour's ride or more. Cost will start from 600 Baht per person, you can bargain. we were offered a ride for 500 Baht two persons in the evening and the same thing in the morning when asked was 600 per person. You will have to bargain. If you want a better bargain go in the week days."

A very inexpensive alternative is the Express Boat Service, stopping at piers dotted all along the river through central Bangkok and connecting to the BTS Skytrain network at Central Pier. The relaxing boat trip will give you good views of the riverside wats (temples) and other prominent buildings, with the opportunity to hop on and off to explore on foot from the numerous piers. You will see the local dwellings built on stilts over the river, commercial barge trains and a generally different view of the city. We took a trip north to Nonthaburi (end of the line). We hopped off the ferry into a pleasant hassle free shopping street with market stalls and prices aimed at Thais - not a Farrang in site.You can also arrange a day hopping on and off at some of the old city's major attractions such as the Grand Palace and the Reclining Budha. You do have to pay each time you hop on but at 15 baht a time on the orange flag Express who's complaining. There is also a blue flag Tourist Express at 40 baht a time or 150 baht Day Card."

It's a great view of the city, interesting watching life go by. As a cheap option just take the local taxi boats and go up and down the river. Maybe just pick a stop and get off for a walk and see what delights you find. On a recent trip I had my girlfriend with me and we ended up paying a long tail boat to take us round the canals. A first, me being a budget traveler, I was against paying so much but have to say it was great to see these canals, river houses and how they connect with the main river"

We had the opportunity to experience this magnificent river from 2 perspectives - From a \"River View\" room on the 12th floor of the Chatrium Hotel where early morning you will see a flotilla of yellow service boats heading off to collect the rubbish from riverside dwellings, followed by the passenger ferries plying their trade to the numerous piers along the river. Then come the big boys - Tugs slowly pulling strings of 3 & 4 massive barges loaded with all manner of bulk goods. Finally the river is always a buzz with \"long tail\" boats and all the hotel private ferries taking their guests to the central Pier.We then experienced the river 1st hand as part of a tour. Spending over an hour cruising the \"Klongs\" - man made canals - where you will see a variety of houses, industries, temples and cafes. In these areas the residents use the river water for everything except to drink. We would recommend such a trip to see a different perspective of family life on thr \"River of Life\"."

For certain key tourist places, (e.g. the Palace, the Golden Temple, Oriental Shopping Emporium and many others) there is no nicer way of arriving than by river taxi. Pick up one from your hotel if you're staying on the river, or go to a pier located near a BTS stop and pick up a taxi boat there. They are cheap, quick, and very accessible - plus there is something very special about viewing old Bangkok from the river, taking in the many historical and cultural sights along the way.

What I would like to share to you is; better start the cruise around 5.30 pm as the sun and heat are more friendly to your skin. but if you have no problem with humid and heat, do it whenever you wish as long as you bring drinking water, hat or umbrella during dry seasonthose who'd like to go here from Siam station by BTS Sky Train please disembark at Thaksin station (one stop after Surasak station)Enjoy Bangkok everyone.."

We booked the dinner cruise with complimentary pick up online.From our hotel in Siam area, it took us less than 30 minutes to reach the pier. It was early at 5:45 pm and we had an opportunity to observe the life along the river while we wait for our ride. It was the busiest thoroughfare for locals and tourists.For 15 Baht, you could avoid the horrible traffic on the roads of Bangkok. The converted teakwood rice barge came on the dot. The moment we set foot on the boat we were greeted warmly by girls in Thai costume who turned out to be the performers for the night. We were ushered to our table and the waiter briefly told us about the menu. It started of with a traditional Thai appetizer, pomelo with bits of tuna fish wrap on a betel leaf. It was unfamiliar to us so we gave it a miss. While waiting for the next dish to be served, I turned my gaze outside to admire the view, perfect for a romantic dinner. No drizzle, unlike the night before, made it more perfect. Unexpectedly, the river has no smell like other rivers that run along a densely populated cities like Bangkok. Except for the deafening roar of boats passing us by, it was a quiet ride in general. We passed by Temples, parks, hotels, restaurants, homes, government buildings, clubs, houses and occasional shanties on stilts. We were pleased with the service and the experience was priceless. The dinner and cruise lasted for about 2 hours . Oh well, time passes us by when we are having the best of time. KhabKhun"

This time , it was not intended beforehand. Just my husband and I were supposed to enjoy dinner at the Thai restaurant in Mandarin Oriental Hotel - sorry, I cannot remember the name of that place right now.We were very excited to hear that we had to take a boat to get there, because the restaurant is across the river separated from the main building.Yes, honestly, the Chao Phraya is not the crystal-clear riverbut I think it contains the lives of people in Bangkok, which makes this river more attractive.While having fabulous dinner at the outdoor resaturant, we watched many excursion ships sailing with their own character-really intense -and it was like being another kind of Moulin Rouge!!!!I have to confess I'm so romantic...But I won't forget about this experience and really thank the Chao Phraya."

On my first trip to Bangkok over twenty years ago I stayed in a fairly non-descript hotel, found the streets hot, smelly and noisy and got hasselled to death by Tuk Tuk drivers and tailors - this was a short stay on the way to Phuket and a dive trip. At my second stay (many years later) my partner suggested staying by the river and booked the Sheraton Royal Orchid. I love boats, working harbours and the comings and goings of ferries and water craft of all kinds - I used to catch a ferry to work in Sydney and for ten years drove them - so I guess you can say I am a somewhat kindly disposed to life near the water. The Chao Phraya is a busy water way - large barges of every description are towed back and forth carrying fuel, construction materials, crates of coca cola and Chang beer, and huge numbers of ferries carry people across and up and down the river. take a tour of the canals and you will see a very different side to Bangkok - peaceful water ways full of catfish - huge monitor lizards sunning themselves and even the odd freshwater turtle - this river may look dirty but it's full of life. There is nothing better than eating breakfast in the early morning and watching life in Bangkok pass by - and if you stay in a hotel with it's own boat you can get free transport to the Saphin Taksin Skytrain station and explore Bangkok more widely without getting stuck in traffic. My views about Bangkok have certainly changed - it's streets are still hot and noisy, and in some places very smelly indeed - but it's become my favourite big asian city, I enjoy the odd high speed ride in a tuk tuk after dark (opt for a cab with a/c in the day if you need to leave the Skytain) and still make a point of catching a ferry or hiring a long tail boat on every visit to see a side to Bangkok away from the crowds and the traffic."

Overall the scenery isn't too spectacular, I would imagine a private boat that went up the smaller rivers feeding into it would be more exciting but the cost is more than reasonable and if you actually stay in your seat instead of pulling a Kate from Titanic up on the front bow like I did you will learn a lot from the boat crew. We used it to get up river from the main pier for about an hour and then just walked back through the markets. Highlight of our trip to Bangkok to be sure!!!! The flower market at sunset was unbelievable, and just walking the streets for hours was a great way to experience true Thai life. The river is definitely the way to move around though. Traffic is infuriating, and constantly negotiating with tuk-tuk drivers or scammy taxi's gets to be a bit much."

You will need to take a boat on the Chao Phraya to travel from one site to the next.

It's scary when it's time to get off the boat, you have to find your way off the boat because the boat is too crowded. People will make way but you have to be fast or the boat will move to the next pier and you will be stuck. It's also really convenient for tourists who plan to visit places like Royal Barges Museum, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, Grand Palace, Chinatown, Pak Klong Talad Flower Market etc."

Many passenger ferries travel along the Chao Phraya so it's easy to get on and off at one of the wharves to access temples, shopping malls, hotels and local markets (the flower market was particularly interesting). The ferries are usually very crowded so there's a rush of activity at each brief stop, quite chaotic at times. There's a roar of the engine against the current, the excited shrill of the ferry boy's whistle and a rush of people joining or leaving the ferry. Boats of all sizes use the river transporting people and goods. Apart from just a couple of modern runabouts, all the traffic is of an aging traditional solid wooden structure. There's no recreational fleet here. A fascinating experience and well worth it during a stay in Bangkok."

If staying in Kaosan Road or thereabouts, the nearest jetty you can take the boat from in Phra Pinklao Bridge. If you walk along Phra Arthit Road, which then becomes Phra Sumen Road ( Thanon Phra Arthit or Thanon Phra Sumen in Thai) You will come to a small white painted round fort situated in a little park beside the river. It dates from the 19th century and has cannons poking out over the battlements. If you go past the fort on your left side towards the Phra Sumen end of the same road you will see on your left a government building with tall Asoka trees in the grounds. Near this also on the river side is a sign for the Express Boat directing passengers down a short alley to a small pier.You can get the Express Boat which is a long one story boat usually filled with people. Usually a man blows a whistle rapidly to signal passengers to quickly jump on or off. Then the boat speeds away. You pay for a ticket on the boat when a lady with a cylindrical ticket clipper comes along. Most journeys are only about 10 baht. You can go to the Grand Palace or right down to the old Oriental Hotel which is near the big GPO. If you go in the opposite direction and pay more you can go as far as Nontaburi in the north of Bangkok. This can be a nice day trip, but go in the morning because last boats are about 5pm. Check to make sure when on the boat.There are lots of places you can go to by boat including the Royal Barges and Wat Arun. It is nicer to go by boat than tuk-tuk or local bus because it is very cool from the breeze. If you want to go on a trip around the various klongs (canals) you can also hire a long tail speedboat, but these tend to be quite expensive because it is like hiring a private taxi instead of a bus. However you can bargain the price down from a few thousand baht to a few hundred, which can be Ok if split between four or five people. Always have a card with the name of your accomodation writen in English and Thai so you do not have trouble getting home if you get lost. A Bangkok Bus Map can be bought for about 40 baht from any small shop in Kaosan Road to help you get around. It usually has a map of the skytrain too and information about places of interest."

If you have a very short time to explore Bangkok, but you still want to take picture of the landmarks, you can take the shortcut through the Chao Phraya River. Bangkok's first five star hotel Mandarin Oriental, Old Customs House, Portuguese Embassy, China Town, Grand Palace, and Fort Phra Sumen from the late 18th century, all are accessible and clearly visible from the Chao Phraya River. What you need to do is, come to Saphan Taksin BTS station and walk to the Sathorn Express Boat Terminal/Pier (less than one minute walk). Board the Chao Phraya Express Tourist Boat and take a round trip (One way 40 THB, Return 80 THB total, Day Pass 150 THB). In express tourist boat, announcements are made in English. On board, a tourist guide will point to the landmarks and tell about the history of the landmarks. Details about the boat timetable can be found onhttp://www.chaophrayaexpressboat.com/en/tourist/index.asp. After 6PM, you can take a dinner cruise that will serve dinner and show you around. However, that is certainly an expensive option (Starts from 700 THB). Moreover, taking picture of the landmarks at night is bit troublesome from a vibrating boat."

Grand Palace aside, the Chao Phraya River Cruise is also a great way to get to Chinatown (Yaowarat), especially for those looking at taxi alternatives. My family took the BTS to Saphan Taksin Station, where the Sathorn Pier is located directly next to it. The ride on the yellow flag ferry costs 15 baht. Buy the ticket from the lady standing by the side of the ticketing counter (and NOT from the counter itself because that one sells the tourist version at 40 baht) - the 15-baht ticketing lady is usually seen with a silver metal cylinder - that's where you receive your tickets.Chinatown is at Ratchawong Pier, which is the fifth stop. After the fourth stop, make your way to the back of the ferry and alight from there. Take note that there is very little time to alight, and there is no staff to shout out the pier's name - it's always better to make your way swiftly to the back once the ferry approaches the dock.Be cautious and alert too, as we happen to witness tourists getting scammed by ferry operating companies. Try to avoid talking to smiling locals when they strike a friendly conversation with you, talking about a 'local' method to travel. Keep your maps so that you do not stand out as a tourist. I believe the 15-baht ticket is already the cheapest method available out there via ferry. Good luck!"

Great to see Bangkok as it once was, wooden shacks somehow still supported by pillars wedged in to the canal banks. Huge lizard spotted on the final leg of our journey and another nerve-wracking moment with a massive ship on our return to the main river. We were dropped at a different jetty from where we boarded where a local tried to charge us a 'landing fee'. Sure this isn't necessary and with only notes on us, blagged that we had no Thai bhats so he took a bit of english shrapnel that was left in my pockets instead. Would like to have ventured further back through the canals and will perhaps hop off in the depths for a look around next time."

On a hot day in April my girlfriend and I took a break from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok to enjoy a cold drink in the shade along the shore of the river near the Peninsula Hotel. Neat watching the long tail boats go back and forth and the ferries carrying people from one side to the other. You can get another good view from the nearby bridge connecting both districts of Bangkok. Nice way to just relax for an hour or so."

We got on and off as we wanted and we even had a Thai lady tell us we were going the wrong way as this was not a tourist area. Anyway after lots of fun on the trains we went back to the river and decided to go north to the last boat stop which is Nonthaburi another province of Thailand but classed as a suburb of Bangkok due to being so close. We used the tourist boats to the end of the line which is Pier 13 (Navalai River Resort) where everyone gets off including us then we used the express boats to carry on to Pier 30 the end of the trip at Nonthaburi. What fun this is, I though express meant missing a few stops, but no this boat still stops for about one second, people just jump on and off so quickly, absolutely no waiting for anyone even is your 2 seconds from getting on the boat.  Nonthaburi was fantastic; everyone was very friendly and happy to talk to us as we walked along Pratcharat Rd which is the main road for a few minutes to the Central markets which will be on your right. These authentic Thai markets are amazing, packed with everything you could possibly think of with stall after stall of fruit, vegetables, fish, flowers, spices etc along with some delicious food stalls.After a good look around here and something to eat we caught an old style bicycle rickshaw back to the pier for another 30 stops/pier stations to our starting point.  We will definitely go back to Nonthaburi and have a better look around as there is so much to see and do in the area."

If you bargain a little bit you can get your private boat for 1,000 Baht per hour, even you are a couple or a small group of 4 people. Even the water is not really clean, but the fresh breeze on the river let you forget the heat in town. You will pass some old thai houses and get a little feeling of the Thai floating market. Be careful when you buy something from the other boats. They will charge the tourist more than double (a can of beer 100 Baht - Supermarket price is less than 40 Baht). Tell the boat driver to drop you at the Flower market (Pa Klong Talard). You should really see this place too."

The ferries on the Chao Phraya river provide a good city excursion between sites and are also excellent alternatives to avoid Bangkok traffic and get to many touristy sites. There is a ferry line run by the government which arrives/departs every 15/20 miniutes and costs only THB 15. One word of caution is that, avoid private Ferries which cost more to cruise on the river. Especially on Sathorn pier tourists are hounded by private ferry lines which cost THB 40 or more. One is better of avoiding them as the service is not different than the one provided by the government."

The organised tour (through AsiawebDirect) which involved a noisy but interesting long tail boat ride with commentary & a rice barge tour afterwards with heaps of freash fruit and more drinks than we could possibly finish, including whisky. And we have hired a boat ourselves, but didnt like the whole negatiation ritual and didnt feel that we got vaue for money this way.When we go again, we'll probably do an organised tour and also the public boats to get to where we're going, and we will definately spend time on the Chao Phraya."

Riding along on the ferry boats, for which there is a nominal trip charge, or the cost of a full day pass, one sees a cross section of building styles and land uses. Numerous temples dot the shores and some of them are open to tourists. A stroll through local markets on the west bank give a look at the way of life for people who live in the area.Many very nice restaurants look out over the river, in fact some are physically over it. For a few kilometers, paved and lit walkways allow easy passage on foot between the bars, restaurants and shops. (No fee for use of the walkway.) Plans are afoot by the government to expand and improve further the amenities along the river, and hopefully private investment will provide further development of appealing facilities while preserving the historical and cultural sites along the way."

We used the orange flag boats because they stop at every pier (Tha). The cost is very cheap and the fresh air is cooling after queuing in the humidity. Always carry small change for the fair which you pay on the boat to a lovely lady conductor. Pay attention to announcements as they're generally in Thai, so you need to understand the pier number and name where you want to get off."

Boats are operated efficiently, however until you have your bearings regarding where you want to get off its difficult to understand some of the conductor's announcements of where the boat is stopping and on one occasion the boat failed to stop for me."

Most boats go fairly frequently, but there can be a fair wait at times if you are wanting to catch a free ferry to a particular hotel or restaurant, as the service will be run by them themselves.

The journey was entertaining, the boat tourist guide shared the history of the various riverside buildings and their architecture.The river was busy with lots of boats, some for locals, and some for tourists. The journey definitely value for money and it was an enjoyable experience. I recommend this as an alternative mode of transportation to go to the China Town area, Flower Market, Wat Pho and Wat Arun.You buy the ticket from a small booth for the Express Boat service. You can buy single, one-way tickets, or a day pass. The day pass allows you to get on and off at any of the stops. But remember, by late afternoon the number of tourists returning to the BTS Saphan Thaksin stop is quite large and the boats soon become full of passengers.Overall, the journey experience was very good and was very different form of travel compared to the train or taxi in order to go to Grand Palace Bangkok."

We were going to book for a nice dinner cruise but they're too expensive, prices starting from 1500 thb pp. We then figured that we could catch the BTS to Saphan Taksin (cost us 42 thb each from Siam) and then from there catch the tourist boat, pay the all day fee of 150 thb each. Done! The tourist boat stops at a few places along the river, and each stop will take you to certain tourist attraction, such as the Chinatown, the Wat Arun, Wat Pho, Grand Palace, etc. You can get off/on as much as you like. Catching the boat and BTS is definitely much better than catching the tuk2 smelling fumes. I'm glad we did this rather than the dinner cruise. Worth experiencing."

Do take care of children and friends if you are travelling in a group. It is very crowded post evening when ferries depart. Cruise is costly foe a 45 minute ride and average food.

            "review": "A Guide to Boat services on the Chao Phraya. The BTS Skytrain provides transportation links between the newer parts of Bangkok. It does not extend to the older quarters where the river takes over as the major means of transport. Less than \u00a31GBP will buy you a ticket that covers most of the popular tourist attractions. Due to the endless traffic jams on the roads I recommend the Skytrain and River boats over taxis every time.The various types of boat transport available and the reason for their different coloured flags are confusing for a first-time visitor to Bangkok. For that reason I hope that this review will help summarise the services available.The Thas or piers are numbered and have clear signage in English as well as Thai. The Central Pier (Pier 0 or CEN) is called Tha Sathorn and is next to the Saphan Taksin Skytrain station. Piers to the north of Central Pier are labelled \u2018N\u2019 followed by a number and piers to the south labelled \u2018S\u2019 followed by a number. The most popular tourist attractions are located between Central Pier (0) and N13 and the trip between the two takes about half an hour.List of major Piers and their associated tourist attractions:\u2022 N15 (Tha Thewet) \u2013 for Thewet plant and flower market\u2022 N14 (Tha Rama 8 Bridge) \u2013 for Rama VIII Bridge\u2022 N13 (Tha Phra Athit) \u2013 for Ratanakosin Island \u2022 N12 (Tha Phra Pin Klao) \u2013 for Klong Bangkok Noi and Museum of Royal Barges\u2022 N11 (Tha Railway Station) \u2013 for Bangkok Noi (Thonburi) train station\u2022 N10 (Tha Wang Lang) \u2013 for Siriraj Hospital and Medical and Pathological Museums\u2022 N9 (Tha Chang) \u2013 for Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaeo (Temple of the Emerald Buddha)\u2022 N8 (Tha Tien) \u2013 for Wat Pho (Temple of the Reclining Buddha) and cross-river ferry to Wat Arun (Temple of the Dawn)\u2022 N7 (Tha Rajinee) \u2013 for Chinatown vegetable market and cross-river ferry to old Portuguese Quarter\u2022 N6 (Tha Memorial Bridge) \u2013 for Phra Poklao Bridge and Chinatown\u2022 N5 (Tha Rachawongse) \u2013 for Chinatown\u2022 N4 (Tha Marine Department) \u2013 for River city shopping, Holy Rosary Church and Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel\u2022 N3 (Tha Si Phraya) \u2013 for Portuguese Embassy\u2022 N2 (Tha Wat Muang Kae) \u2013 for Old Customs House and GPO building\u2022 N1 (Tha Oriental) \u2013 for Oriental Hotel and O.P. Place shopping\u2022 Central Pier (Tha Sathorn) \u2013 for Saphan Taksin Skytrain stationExpress Boat ServicesThese serve different routes and are identified by coloured flags. Not all services stop at all piers and different services end at different times of the day. Check the route map to see which coloured flag boat calls at which Pier number. When on the boat, move to the front. Protocol suggests that the rear is reserved for people wishing to get off at the next stop.Tourist BoatsThese are more expensive but are less crowded and there is also an on-board commentary in English to highlight POIs. A one-day unlimited ticket costs 150 THB (\u00a33GBP) or 30 THB (\u00a30.60p GBP) for single journeys.

You can stop at boat piers to visit some famous religion pagoda such as Wat Arun, Wat Pho, Grand Palace, etc, and can see daily activities of local people living in river bank. It's so easy to go to boat pier, take BTS, then stop at Saphan Thaskin, you can see centrel pier immediately. Take the yellow line boat, just cost only 15Bath. If you buy tourist boat, it's cost 150Bath, you can have a tour guide who give you some information about attractions around the pier you stop, but in my opinion, it's not worthly. Whatever you chose, i highly recommand you to join this boat tour!!!!"

My fiancee and I tried to visit the Grand Royal Palace on Sunday, and much to our disappointment, we arrived at 3:40PM, and the palace grounds closed at 3:30PM. What luck. After walking up to the entrance, a very friendly police officer started talking to us, asking where we were from and what we had done in Bangkok so far. He then told us that we want to go see the river, and spoke to a local walking by instructing him (in Thai) to take us to the river boats.This was a little strange to us, but we wanted to see the river, so we followed the local. He was very nice, and stopped every time we fell behind. We then approached a market where he told us to follow him, that the river is inside. We both looked at each other a little bit confused, wondering if this was a translation issue or even a scam. But our guide lead us straight up to a tour desk and told us to have fun. What a nice guy!Anyways, a lady at the counter talked us into an hour tour around the Chao Phraya River so that we can see the floating market, and all of the surrounding temples and locals. The tour cost about $70 all together, but we figured it was a must see in order to experience all of Bangkok. Plus we were exhausted from negotiating at the weekend market earlier in the day. So we signed up, she gave us each a loaf of bread to feed the fish, and a drink for the road. We were then rushed to the doc where we got our own private gondola! We were still a little bit confused about the whirlwind that went on, and how we got our own boat, but the ride was so much fun. We saw so many sights that we can only experience on the water. I bought a little Thai fan from the floating market, we fed thousands of catfish, were squirted by children with squirt guns, and even waved to a few young monks. We took tons of photos and giggled the whole way how we stumbled on this little gem.For more tips on Bangkok, and more travel, visit andivance.com . I post reviews of many attractions and cities we visit :)"

We walked from our hotel to the Sathorn pier really straight forward paid at one kiosk and got on to get off at the Thai pier which is for the Grand Palace. 200 baht no problem. We then came back for the return and it was complete chaos groups taking precedence private hire taking presidence and the tourist police were sorry, useless. All it needed was two signs one 'public service' in Thai the other groups. We asked for public service were pointed to the Jetty the Police said push through the queue, we did the boat staff ignored us the organisers ignored us wouldnt even look at us, they both got vocally told thank you. And the group guide who tried to push me out of the way won't do again.So if you want to do it privately go the one way, walk a bit back to where you came from and then get a Turk tuk or taxi.Thailand tourist board you are killing that with groups organise more money better visit ie loads of stalls right off the pier adds to the chaos put them on the grass outside the palace more space more time more fianc\u00e9."

The river is close to the Grand Palace and Wat Arun. One river-based treat i like to take is to ride a waterbus. These go up and down the river just like land busses. They are a very inexpensive way to see the city from the river--more \"local\" that the tourist-laden cruises. The river is always active and busy. There's lots of barges going down river heavily laden with rice and going back up empty--note the difference in how low the full ones are in the water. You can use the river as a base for trips to the floating market of for trips on the powerful Thai river boats (I forget the name)."

The sights we saw were worth the money but the guide/captains English was very limited & his repertoire consisted of 'Temple!' & 'Tip!!'..We left from a small pier a little way up from the Sheraton & disembarked at The Grand Palace.Be Very aware of aggressive touts (even dressed as police) and tuktuk drivers that are hell bent on trying to take you to shoddy tailors."

On getting back on the boat i was asked to pay again only to discover i had been given two one way tickets worth 40 baht each. The guides on the boat did question this with the cashier at Sathorn who misteriously failed to admit her swindling ways, okay i know its not much money but they dont call Bangkok 'rip off city' for nothing."

I was staying a bit farther down the river from the Palace and many of the other big tourist areas, so I frequently used the ferry to go up and down the river. It was very cheap and for some reason I thought it was the most enjoyable form of public transportation in Bangkok, maybe just because it was different than anything I've experienced before. It felt like riding in a public bus in any other city, but on the river instead. The views were very nice. I felt like I got all of the scenery of a river tour just on my daily commute. I'd definitely recommend the ferries as a good way to get around town."

You can also take the Tourist Ferry that acts a little like the Sightseeing Busses you see in most cities, using the Hop on/Hop off system and cost 150 Bhat or splash out on your own Long Tail boat that will speed you along the river at a rate of knots - prices dependent an on length of trip/number of people."

For moving up and down the city this is the way as it is more fun, quicker and cooler than going by taxi.Just be prepared to work out which boat goes where and be aware that if you are not careful you will be sidelined onto a \"private boat\" with a \"private bill\" to pay. Stick to the municipal boats.Also despite looking filthy the river teams with fish - what I wonder is wrong with the Thames in London? Just a thought."

I can't believe that the water authorities don't have a cleaning schedule. It is vile.

We decide to ask the staff at the pier and was directed to the tourists booth where the fares are 150 baht for full day ticket or 40 baht for one way. We went with the cheapest as we only want to go to Chinatown. Next came the wait, we reached the pier at 845am and were told by staff at ticket booth that ferry will arrive in 15mins time. We waited and waited, ferry only came at 930am. You can imagine the long queue of tourists trying to squeeze on the ferry. Most without seats end up standing behind. Personally i didn't enjoy the ride. Also find it a waste of time to wait 45mins for a 5min ride."

Take a ride during the day and admire the the buildings that line the river then, go back, freshen up and return for dinner on the river.

Unbeknown to us (we didn't read all the details) we stopped half way and changed to a beautiful old wooden barge where there was a huge array of food (fruit, sticky rice etc) and an open bar which was included in the price. At the end of the cruise we were promptly into our van and returned safley to our hotel. Overall a fantastic experience which I'd do again at a very reasonable price.

Yes, the water is dirty, the water traffic is somewhat chaotic, and there are touts selling over-priced trips. Don't let that discourage you. Buy a 'local' ticket and ride up and down the river. My recommendation would be to avoid the long tail boats unless severely pressed for time; they're expensive and pretty much tourist-centric. Another good idea is to avoid the local boats at rush hour; they can get very crowded. Non-rush hour, we always managed to find a seat. In short, do not miss a boat ride on the Chao Phraya!"

We were wandering around the China Town area, looking lost I guess. when a kind local asked if we needed help? I said We were looking for the \"river\" so put us on a Tuktuk and nec minute we were at a jetty haggling with a river tour bloke. I just wanted to take the river taxi for a look around, but no he insisted this was the best and only way to see the river. We were supposed to get to feed fish, a walk around a temple and lots of photo oops! Because I haggled him down from 2500 baht to 1200 baht I am sure he told our long tail boatman to \"make them suffer\"! On the water we wallowed around in the wash of a hundred other boats on the river, all the while the driver idling along not telling us a thing. After 20 minutes of idling and revving his engine randomly, we headed up a channel. The view of the abject poverty and filth in the water was eye opening. The boatman stopped near some dodgy bloke in a tiny canoe who tried to sell up some expensive useless junk and overpriced beer. He left disgruntled and we continued back to the river and were then dumped on some \"private jetty\" where we were charged a 20 baht exit fee. Another Bangkok rip off."

Watching how the boat is kind of tied to each pier is another. Boarding and disembarking is an experience as well. Continued to Saphan Taksin to take the skytrain. Two conclusions, first this is a highly recommended ride, and second this one was way too short."

The most convenient access unless you are staying at a riverfront hotel is reached by getting off the BTS at the river at the Sathorn/Saphan Taksin station. After getting off the BTS walk towards the river where you will find someone selling tickets. Make sure you know how long you will have to wait. The river can be rough and getting on and off can be difficult if your mobility is limited. The boats tend to bounce a lot on the open river, leading to a lot of spray. DON'T open your mouth! Do keep your camera handy for that unforgettable shot of kids swimming in the water, beautiful (and not so beautiful) housing, the Grand Palace, impressive hotels and lots of tourists and many working boats and barges."

Beware if you get dropped off at a private pier where they will try to sell you a long tail boat tour up and down the river for 1000-1500 Batt. Stick with the public boat taxi. It is an experience too, lots of people, smelly engines and the boats seem to barely stop and go, so be nibble getting on and off. I found this part of the charm but others may not."

It avoids traffic. Its very cheap (under 50 baht). Its a little challenging to navigate but people are friendly and the \"boat conductor\" can tell you too. 2. Hire a long tail boat. This cost of this depends on what you want and your negotiating skills but expect to pay 1000-2000 baht for a private long tail boat for 1-2 hours. This should include a tour of the khlongs (canal system) and a stop off at a Temple or two. Note: If you do option 2, there are souvenir and drink vendors who will paddle up in small boats to sell to you. A great way to grab some refreshment."

I have done a number of cruises along the Chao Phraya River and I recommend that when staying in Bangkok, do the river cruise HOWEVER there are some considerations that need to be made. Tourist prices re those upmarket river/dinner cruises can be expensive but do it just once for the experience. Also longboat rides thorough a tourist agency at the hotel can also be expensive. I normally go to the river bank and where the longboats are moored and ask one of the driver's, how much to go 1 hr along the river. You can bargain with them to take you a few kilometres up the river. DO the longboat as it is a great experience, in a narrow wooden boat with an eight cylinder engine powering you effortlessly and very fast, through the water. Just be careful NOT to get any of the water splashing up your nose as the river is dirty, brown, smells and has, who knows what, bacteria in it. But It is a great way to get to see the locals living along the bank. The driver will take you to a floating market, where you might be lucky to find many boats or a couple, if you are not so lucky, with women wearing a sort of traditional dress and wide brim hats, selling all kinds from food to drink to local produce. Buy the driver some food or drink and he will be very grateful. It is also expected that you will buy something from the market anyway. Because I bought the driver a drink, he let me run the boat for a kilometre or so, before I became really tired trying to keep the boat and the long pole which acts as the rudder in a straight line against the current of the river. The drivers make it seem so easy to manage, IT ISNT, but great fun nevertheless. Go on give it a go!"

Considering its strategic location right in the middle of a huge bustling city, it is, in my opinion, the lifeline of Bangkok.Just consider its contribution to the city's economy right from the hotels located on it to the ferry operators who take you around to the fishermen who fish for their livelihood. Unfortunately the only negative part of this River is that it provides an outlet to the city's drains who unabashedly discharge all their filth into it. The dirty water has to be seen.We took the 40 Baht one way ticket to travel by the express tourist ferry from Saphan Taksin to Wat Pho (7th stop), from where we took the ferry across the river (3 Baht) to Wat Arun, which unfortunately was under renovation and could not be seen at close quarters. The 3 baht ferry is a pretty basic one which only has to continuously ferry people from one side of the river to the other side and back, but as I said before, is a part of Bangkok's lifeline.Anyhow, this review is about the river, so I will not dwell much more, except to say that on our way back we took the normal ferry which charged us only 15 Baht. Its only disadvantage was that it stopped on each pier stop, made a lot of noise and there was no commentary which the express 40 baht ferry gives.This transportation cost is much more economical than any other form of travel, with the added advantage of being free from traffic jams, pollution and gets you to your destination much faster than if you had to travel on the same route by road.It also affords you the luxury of passing by Chinatown and the many hotels such as Peninsula who adorn its banks. It also gives you the added attraction of a dinner cruise, but more of that at a later time.This is certainly one of the highlights of Bangkok which is not to be missed at any cost."

For some great views of the Chao Phraya river in Bangkok you should stay at one of the many hotels alongside the river, making sure you have a room with a river view! Our choice would be the Millenium Hilton Hotel, but other options would be The Peninsular Hotel, the Sheraton and the Shangri-La. All these hotels have their own complimentary river boats to take you across the river, and connect to public ferries, and the sky train. They also have riverside terraces, restaurants and bars. Watching life on the river is fascinating - the long- tail boats whizzing by, the hotel boats that look like little houses with twinkly lights outlining their roofs, the passenger ferries carrying the locals to work or shopping, the large dinner cruise launches with their onboard chefs and musicians, and the huge, dark barges with their mysterious loads hidden by tarpaulin, being towed by little tug- boats. You will be entranced!"

Ok 20 Baht, so off we went with all the locals. the Ferry get along at a good pace and only stops if people want to get off or on. So an hour and 20 mins later we were a long way down the river with no sign of turning around. We asked the conductor does this ferry go back to Bangkok. He said \"No have to catch another one I tell you when\" . A couple of stops later he said \"You catch this one as wel moored there was another ferry on the next wharf ready to go. So we jumped off and on to the other boat. The conductor came over after about half an hour and asked for 15 Baht to Central pier. It was now dark so the river boats, temples and bridges were all lit up and looking amazing. So daytime photos on the way up and nighttime shots on the way back. What a great way to see this majestic river and surrounds ,three hours all for 70 Baht for two people great value."

It's also pretty dirty, so don't fall in!There are evening dinner cruises, but as an 11 year resident of Bangkok, I don't fall into the tourist traps. More information on these expensive (and often short) dinner cruises here - http://goo.gl/maps/sn2o5Then there's the tourist version of the river taxi here with a good map - http://www.chaophrayaexpressboat.com/en/tourist/This is all very well if you ARE a tourist and just want to see the main sites, but be warned, it only covers a short stretch of the main river taxi route, from Central pier neat Saphan Thaksin BTS station (soon to be obsolete and closed) to Phra Athit pier (Khaosan Road). It's also expensive at about 40 baht compared to 15 baht anywhere on the normal boat. See the website and map referred to above.Far better, in my opinion, is to get the normal orange flagged boat from Central Pier all the way to Nonthaburi pier (Ta nam Non) and have your camera ready - there's loads to se, but be warned, it will get very full and if you are on the wrong side of the boat some of the best sights can be obscured.When you get off at Nonthaburi, which is NOT one of the nicest towns in the area, you can walk about half a mile to the market, if you don't mind the smell and the chickens cut in half showing their eggs in various stages of development ... It's also a very crowded footpath to the market.And of course, you can get off at any stop, and mooch about - do some research first, of course. At 15 baht a ticket any distance, it's one of the cheapest ways to get about and also a good way to fill in a day."

I think a cruise on the Mother River should be on your to-do-list when you visit Bangkok. While the boat ploughs the muddy waters you will be able to contemplate the beatiful views of Bangkok, much prettier at night with all the illumination. Many companies offer evening dinner cruises which can be easily arranged by your hotels, depends on the hotel, of course. Some of the hotels will push you to book for the cruise they work with although you have already chosen another, better or cheaper one!There is also an option to go to Ayutthaya by bus or other vehicle, scrutinize the ancient Thai capital and then get back to the modern capital Bangkok by a boat while having a dinner onboard.When we were in Bangkok we went on a boat ride (fast boat, no any facilities, except the seats and the life-jackets,:)) during the day which included some part of Chao Phraya and then we had a long trip through the khlongs. What you can see in the khlongs is definitely not what a tourist would dream of! But nevertheless you will experience the reality.We also used the boat express to cross the river when we went to Wat Arun. What I can advise is: if you don't have a special occasion to celebrate onboard a fancy boat, or just don't want to waste money, or you prefer to travel like a local, you can cruise the river in an ordinary boat (much cheaper) and blend with the locals. You will not be served dinner though on these boats ;).Probably it is not anything new to most of you but for some it will of help, so here you can find a lot of info about Bangkok and will help you to plan your stay there: http://www.bangkok.com/dinner---shows-tours/"

You can get off at the pier for WAT PHRA GAO to see the emerald Buddha, Khao San Road (the backpackers street), Saphan phut (pier 6) For the fabulous flower market, China town (Pier 5).

The price is often inflated so ask around for people getting off the boat about the price before picking one. I think we got 40% off the quoted price. Tuktuk drivers get hefty commissions and will steer you to the place with the best payoff not the best experience.I think we spent about an hour on the big boat and the only people on it were our family which was nice. Some of the houses on the river are completely falling apart and some are very expensive so it was interesting to see how the locals live in those conditions.10 baht to feed the millions of fish in the fish feeding area was worth it for to experience the frenzy."

For years, an afternoon trip on the Chao Phraya River Express Boat to Nonthaburi has been my favorite activity to escape the heat of Bangkok and enjoy some peace and quiet. Apparently too many travelers have read my reviews and the increase in the number of passengers on each of the boats that I traveled on has become disconcerting. Unless you are at the beginning of the line you won't get an \"outside\" seat. If you attempt to exit the boat before you reach Nonthaburi, be prepared to push people out of the way. In addition, the number of boats operating on Sunday is inadequate. Unless service is increased, I would suggest looking for alternative means of transportation, particularly on Sunday. Also consider traveling earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon. Still the biggest bargain in Bangkok."

The boats are fast and efficient and you pay before to get off to a person walking around the boat yelling something you dont understand. =) If you are looking for sightseeing, I wouldn't recommend these boats because the view from inside the boat aren't that good.

Orange flag boats--just get on (you don't need to buy a ticket ahead of time-someone comes round and collects $ after the boat is moving) On my first day in Bangkok I took the blue flag boat figuring the narration would help me orient to the city. Problem was even Asian's who speak great English can have real pronunciation problems and the loud speakers were bad so I never understood a word. The river boats are a GREAT way to get around though (down to the Royal Palace area etc) and you get a good view of the city. (Yes, they are crowded and good chance you may end up standing with lots of other people like a crowded subway, but the river ferries combined with BTS/MRT are a great way to get around) So 5 star transport system but 2 star tourist cruise. http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//3/35/Bangkok-transit-map.png"

The non-tourist river-buses are more fun, more authentic, and cheaper, so we prefer to jump on with the locals, monks, and other less pedestrian tourists, etc.It can also be a lot easier using the boats than taxis etc. to get to some of the attractions along the river such as the Royal Palace, Wat Arun, etc.Definitely recommended to experience from either the shore, on the river itself, or both."

Here, you can see many contrasts... building that resemble Miami and houses that holds people below the line of poverty; temples and discos; cheap stalls of food and luxurious restaurants. Absolutely you must take a boat and navigate the river. My suggestion is to get the cheap communal boat (the one like a floating bus that stops many times), there is no use to pay so much for the touristic one... if you want the real feeling of the city, merge with the local and take the one I suggested (fyi we took the private one and we regret doing so: you end paying a lot for the same or even worse cause you miss the local energy)."

Sure you can take a taxi, a tuk-tuk, or even the BTS or MRT to see many attractions in Bangkok, but taking a trip on a Chao Phraya river ferry is efficient, cheap, and an attraction in itself.There are two types of ferries going north and south on the river: orange flag and blue flag. Orange flag are local public ferries that cost 15 baht per ride. Blue flag ones are tourist ferries and cost 40 baht per ride. You can buy a blue flag day pass for 150 baht.Pros and cons: orange flags are cheap but can get crowded. Blue flags are more expensive but sometimes less crowded.There are also ferries that only go from one side of the river to the other and these are cheaper. Also, there are a few hotels like the Mandarin Oriental and Peninsula operating their own boats across the river, but you can use these for free as well (they go to the hotel's \"private\" dock).There's no limit to the length of your ride, meaning you can get on at N1 and ride all the way north some thirty stops and receive a \"poor man's river tour\" for either 15 or 40 baht. Likewise on the way down. You'll see many sights along the river including Wat Arun.The Chao Phraya is a working river, meaning you'll see lots of daily life going on from barges to cruises to people fishing, washing clothes, etc. Not a clean river, but certainly lively.It's great if you can get a seat on the ferry, otherwise it may be standing room only. Engine noise and whistles at the back.It's a pleasant way to get from Silom/Saphan Taksin to Khao San Road with the breezes off the river."

If the operators appear aggressive, hostile or overly friendly please be aware as there are syndicates that work parts of the transportation tourist industry, They typically overcharge and some tourist experiences can be unpleasant. Take your time and evaluate whether the cost and response appears to be reasonable...you can ask around and local friends can definitely help you decide which operator to opt for and suggest reasonable fares.

You don't need to pay for a guided boat tour, just take the local express boat (orange flag) from the Saphan Taksin = Sathorn = Central Pier (all names for the same stop). For 15Baht (0.45 usd) one way you can ride the boat all the way to the end of the line--Nonthaburi stop #30 on the orange line. Since we were jet-lagged upon arrival in Bangkok, we decided to take this easy boat ride to get the lay of the land/river. We knew we were going to use the express boat to get to the Grand Palace/Wat Po/Wat Arun, and Chinatown later in the week. Note: any time you get off the boat and get back on, it's always 15Baht per ride. An attendant comes (shaking their money box) around the boat collecting your 15Baht and will give change if you don't have exact amount. Have small change on hand.The river is polluted & smells in some places (oil/gas from the boats, maybe poop?) and littered with trash (plastic bags, bottles, etc). Along the way, we saw some floating dead fish, kids swimming in the river, a man in shorts taking a bath w/ soap, and a street vendor washing his pots & dishes (after seeing that we decided to eat only hot bbq skewered street food). Interesting view of life, homes, and construction along the river. You might think it's a boring (long) ride, but it was a relaxing and non-stressful way to get some daylight/sunshine to recover from jet-lag.When we got to Nonthaburi pier (about a 1 hour ride one-way), there is a small village with a main drag perpendicular to the pier. We saw lots of catfish at the pier where you can buy fish food to feed them. We walked along the main drag, got some fresh baked buns from a Thai version of the 85degree bakery (a well-known Taiwanese bakery chain) and some Thai coffee. There are a lot of street vendors selling goods--bags, belts, souvenirs, etc. On the return trip back to Saphan Taksin pier, make sure you go to the correct pier landing (i.e. the direction of the boat going towards the left as you're facing the river)."

They asked us to go behind the line but since people were already going inside the ship, we were sorta got trapped.After a few minutes of being bumped by people, finally, someone assisted us. We waited several minutes for our ship.When we got in, the ship was very nice. The food was okay. The experience was delightful. There was a live entertainment that my mom really loved.We get to see different views of temples and the Palace. I'm glad we did the Dinner Cruise even if it was quite expensive."

It is the way to travel. The river connects more places than the metro, the skyrail or anything fighting the traffic on the roads. It is not the world's most scenic cruise as the river is the prime heavy lifter but enough temples, pagodas, five star hotels and shopping centres (not mall size) are along the way to keep it interesting, and even the pieces between have a certain charm. If you take the popular trip from Central (Taskin Bridge) to stop N8 opposite the Temple of Dawn (Wat Arun), then a further THB 3 (10c US, 6p UK, \u20ac0.10) pays for a ferry across - every few minutes. And the Temple's worth it as its (relative) isolation makes it less busy and if you take the near vertical steps up, some terrific views."

There is a guide narrating the journey in English and in Thai, but sometimes it was hard to hear over the engine and the general noise. It didn't matter since it was clear where you were most of the time. The step on and off the boat could be a bit intimidating - except for Central, they don't stop and tie up the boat properly - the captain just pushes the boat up to the pier and everyone jumps on and off.

Most of the passing ferries, water taxis and cruise boats are attractively illuminated. The on board entertainment was of mixed quality but the food was plentiful and the service crew were good. Having them salute you on arrival and departure seemed a bit over the top though. We also did a longer one way daytime cruise back from a tour and the riverside sights that were revealed were often less attractive than those on the evening cruise, with plenty of ramshackle waterfront houses and derelict boats strangely mixed up with temples and ornate landing stages. The river does seem to be abused as well as used by the locals. All part of the character of the area, but often rather unattractive. The riverside buildings in the city centre did seem to look better when illuminated at night rather than in daylight."

The main terminal is below the Sapphan Taksin BTS station. You can go with the touts who approach you for \"Luxury Cruise\" or \"Guided River Tour\" especially if you have limited time and/or knowledge. But for good fun, join the queues of locals near the proper wharf and take an ordinary ferry. This is certainly the best way to go to the Grand Palace. You pay your fare on board (have some change handy - fares range between 10 and 40 baht depending on the type of ferry and distance.) Hold out your coins and try to pronounce the name of where you're going. The ticket-sellers are quick and efficient.We like taking the ferry all the way to the terminal at Nonathonburi (not sure of that spelling) potter around the local market, have lunch at the Chinese cafe on the riiver downstream from the wharf, and then take the ferry back to town, but we allow ourselves a relaxing non-shopping day for that expedition."

On the way we stopped at a classy jewellery store and a tailor store. We didn't plan on doing this but we agreed to it because it helped the drivers get free petrol vouchers from the stores as commission, and we were not in a rush anyway (I ended up buying 4 beautiful shirts that were delivered to the Hotel). The ride was exciting to say the least, and much more fun than taking the Skytrain ! The river cruise we chose went for 2 hrs (you can select less time) for 3000 THB ($110 AUD) for 3 Adults & 1 Teenager. It is really quite amazing to see how the locals live their lives along the river and canals. It is such a shame about the condition of the river as far as pollution goes.

For example Pier 9 is right next to the back of the Grand Palace, not that you would know walking down the road. Most of the Piers have some market stall\u2019s or other distractions covering the entrances, so if you are picking the boat up at one of the other Piers you need time to find them.The Boat service starts at 09:00 from the Central Pier and the last boat returns at 22:30 (time table included), so you get a full day and also you are able to see the river at night and all the lights etc.Piers include \u2013 Central, No.1, No.3, No.5, No.8, No.9, No.10 and No.13 \u2013 Our hotel was no where near the river, so starting at the Central Pier using the train to get there was our best option.

We sat and watched the river taxis, water buses, restaurant cruisers and huge giant barges towed by tugs moving up and down the river or simply criss-crossing from bank to bank in apparent chaos. Wonderful to watch by day, beautiful to watch by night with the highly-decorated vessels lit in numerous colours. Many of the hotels front onto the river and have bars and restaurants along the waterside. It is also possible to take a high speed long boat along the river, then passing through a lock, into a labyrinth of canals where you can see another side of amazing Bangkok!"

We bought the 150 baht blue flag boat tickets (tourist boat) which allows us to visit various tourist stops accessible along the river eg grand palace, chinatown etc.In fact, we got to understand that the tourist ticket can also be used to board all the other boat services (used mainly by the locals) for unlimited times throughout the day. The tourist boat ticket can be bought at Central Pier directly and comes with a booklet detailing the various sight seeing spots -very good, cheap way to move around and see the various tourists spots if you have a day to spare and do pier hopping.http://www.chaophrayaexpressboat.com/en/home/From the same central pier, there is also a free boat shuttle to Artisque ( many dining options) from 5pm forth."

Take the less expensive boat up the river (a few baht....like 30) and you can go up almost 2-3 stops. Keep going and take it in. The river is the original economic core of the city, so this area is a must see. Some of the food along the river stops is a littler more expensive, but it is actually good. Try the Peninsula hotel lounge for a beer or tea if you have a few baht to kill......it is a fantastic \"watch\"."

Since you can do the same trip in a water taxi for less than THB300 we left. On our way out we met another disappointed couple who were being charged US90 for the same trip, after chatting we decided to go on a group and split the cost between the 4 of us.Ended up paying US 80 for the 4 of us and boarded the boat.On the way, we went trough the suburban houses at the bank of the river, I saw people trowing bags of rubbish to the river and at one point not to my surprise I saw a toilet door open where you could see that human waste goes straight to the water .. and we were all being splashed with this water in the face... so refreshing :) Then we happily eat the fish caught in this \"river\" served in \"nice restaurants\", get sick and wonder why... Looking at the hygiene standards of locals and the lack of reliable water and electricity systems, it is obvious that this river works directly as a septic tank and a dump.Then the trip is really not worth it, we basically traveled no more than 3 Kms at 10km/h, jumped out for 15 mins for sight seeing and went back to the pier.Horrible!"

We took the Express (orange flag) boat and the river itself was fascinating as always with plenty to look at. Unfortunately the town itself was a big let-down being generally grubby and run-down with pavements in a very poor state of repair. The town's biggest claim to fame is the huge food market selling everything eaten in Thailand - fruit, vegetables, fish, prawns, turtles, frogs, eels, etc., etc. This was all very interesting but the narrow passages between the covered stalls are quite claustrophobic and unpleasantly hot/humid - also you need a strong stomach in places. There are no facilities to eat and drink unless you wish to risk street stalls. Vast shoals of large fish gather at the ferry pier to be fed and reasonably clean toilet facilities can be found close by. The ferry only costs 15 Baht each way, paid on board to a ticket lady holding a tin can. On the trip up we were scammed as she did not issue us with tickets when we paid; an inspector boarded the ferry a few stops later and of course we could not prove that we had paid. We told him that we had paid but the ticket lady swore blind that we had not. The inspector obviously believed us (what tourist is going to argue about 30 Baht in total?) and he suspected that the ticket lady was just pocketing fares from tourists. He asked us to make an official complaint but we did not want to ruin our day by filling out forms and making statements so we just paid again. In conclusion, any trip on the river is absolutely fascinating but Nonthaburi is not worth a visit."

Steeped in history and culture thousands of years old, this is the place to see where Bangkok arose from, for without this river Bangkok would not exist; Temples litter the riverside, in between high rise condos and hotels or 5 star ambiance. Huge Dinner-Cruise ships travel up and down in the night adorned with lights that light up the river. In the day heavily laden barges festooned behind tiny tugs boats agonizingly make their way against the currents. occasionally a traditional one man canoe drifts past as the old men navigating them cast their nets out.Thai Ferry-Buses will take you for a 2 hour trip up the river for about 15baht! Or you can use the Tourist Ferry that will give you a running commentary BUT.... you can't get off without paying again once you get back on, I believe it is 150baht? each time you get on, whereas the Thai Ferry-Bus is only 15 baht each time. Perhaps travel up the river on the tourist boat and make a plan for on the way back to get on and off at the stops mentioned by the tour-guide (a bit of planning is needed). My favorite is Watt Arun (Temple of Dawn)you need to visit this at early morning or late evening to see the sun shine on it and sparkle in the light.Sanam Luang (near the Temple of the Jade Buddha - Watt Prakaew), walk along the streets and see people selling millions of buddhas in every form (some authentic, some not), many have set prices too. From here you are in proximity to many other places of interest such as Kings Palace, Sanam Luang, other temples, not far from Kao-San road, etc...The last stop is Nontaburi, not much to see or do there (unless you can find out something I don't know about). Finally just sit back and enjoy the ride, some great photo opportunities. Take some water, it's a long 1+ hour trip in the mid-day. From Saphan Thaksin BTS, you can also find people touting Long-Tail trips for about 1,500baht? (it's what I paid), they said for a 1 hour trip which ended up being 1.5 hours (no extra charge), we traveled along traditional canals with houses and temples all along, it was very entertaining and again, lots of photo op's. Well worth the Private-rented long tail (3 of us but could easily fit 8++. There are some options about where to go but my elderly parents didn't want to walk anywhere so we chose just to sit and travel the whole time."

I had research the trip and I wanted to take one of the local ferries as I'm quite comfortable with getting around on local transport. When we arrived at Central Pier we were jumped on straight away by the high pressure sales people selling the long tail boat tours. The others in our party preferred to go on the long tail boat trip, which was a lot more expensive, so that's what we did. After we'd paid they told us to stand under the cover and wait, we had to wait ages for our turn, probably about 1/2 hour. The tour was ok, much more expensive though and personally I don't think it was worth the money and you were on a time limit where ever you stopped, which was annoying. We did get to see along a couple of the smaller canals which was interesting. We stopped at one place on the canal where we were expected to eat but it wasn't very appealing. It was good to see some of the local canal houses though. We also went through a loch to get into the canal, which was interesting. We also stopped at Wat Arun, it was worth the visit (see my review), we then took the long tail boat across the river to the pier near the Reclining Buddha and decided to finish our journey there rather than head back to the beginning so we could spend our time wandering around the temples and not be on a time limit, which is the problem when you hire one of these long tail boats. Overall if you are not confident taking a local boat and you prefer a guided tour then this was an interesting trip, but I would have preferred the local boat and wander at our own leisure."

This might not be the cleanest river you get to see everyday but the scenic beauty you get to witness during the cruise rides along the river bed is mesmerizing.The cruise rides are the best .every ship has it's own way of pleasing the travelers and the food served in these boats/ships arnt bad at all.The water may be green and ugly but the experiences surrounding it make up for it. If you want to take a small peak of what Bangkok is all about in 2 hours then this is the best way possible."

In this time, you feel how the life is hard in Bangkok. You can see the houses on the river, taking the water from the river, the bad smells etc every time. But in the morning, you will see the employees working in the city's plaza's leaving their houses with black suites, ties, ladies with skirt etc...And only for not returning their home on the water, they work overtime because they are happy in the city.

There are lots of landmarks that can be seen along the river including the Grand Palace, the Temple of Dawn, River City shopping complex, The Oriental hotel, and Royal Barge museum to name a few. You can take boats that will take you to tourist spots. Cruising along the river is a great way of exploring the city. A must do when in Bangkok."

For all foreign tourists: Shhh! - a money saving trip to savour the sight and sound on the River of Kings for a few baht or dirt cheap in cents or pence; and save your money for a fancy dinner river cruise at night. This northbound river boat trip to Nonthaburi will take you past few bridges, several Wats and give you a view of settlements along the river. It is a worthwhile and interesting boat trip. First, get some small Thai Baht notes or coins because you do not want to be troublesome paying your fare with a 500 or 100 Baht note. Go to Tha Chang, N9 (North Bank 9) pier stop near the Wat Phra Kaew (The Emerald Buddha Temple). At the pier, queue along with the locals for the Chao Phraya Express boat with orange flag and pay the fare onboard the boat. At peak hours in the early morning and later after 4:00 pm, there are other boats with green and yellow flags (small price difference) which can also be used for this northbound trip to Nonthaburi. The fare may still be 15 THB per person each way and the journey takes about 50 minutes as people embark and disembark along the route. Get off at the northernmost stop, Tha Nonthaburi, N30 pier stop.Along the northbound route, you will go past bridges like Phra Pin Klao, Krung Thon, Rama 8, Rama 7 and Rama 5; and several Wats for your photoshoot. Disembark at Tha Nonthaburi N30 and go walkabout the town centre and find something to eat and drink. If you are there early before 9 am, you may visit the Nonthaburi market; or if you are adventurous, you may ask the local here and find your way to visit Koh Kret, which is an island in the Chao Phraya River.When it is time to go back to Bangkok, go back to Tha Nonthaburi and board the orange flagged boat or, depend on the timing, there are also the green and yellow flagged boats. This a fun and enjoyable boat trip which can be had for a cheap fare as paid by the local. A unique experience as well, rubbing shoulder with students, monks, Thai men and women from all walks of life commuting by boat."

Today many attractive offers for tourists to enjoy this river, they can have lunch or dinner on board while cruising along the river to see people's activities on the river. This is the second time I visited this river and in my opinion, the best way to enjoy this river is sailing along this river using public transportation just like the locals. You can enjoy the local culture through their public transport. By using the Chao Phraya Express Boat, you can also visit some of the tourist attractions that exist along this river. Select the Chao Phraya Express Boat was flagged orange, with costs around 15 Baht per person each way, you can get off at the dock that you want to visit the attraction. (Study the map of the Chao Phraya River, in order to know the pier where you should go down) For my visit to the Grand Palace this time, I chose to use the Chao Phraya Express Boat. While enjoying the bustle of the morning along the river, I sailed from Sathorn pier and down in the Mahraj pier, then a little walk to the Grand Palace. Sailing along the river in the morning becomes a unique experience in my holidays."

Can get rather crowded and hectic during rush hour as the locals use it as their mode of transport from work home. No safety regulations seem to be in place, there is no limit to how many passengers they can pack on and there are no life jackets to be seen.The river is very busy with a constant stream of ferries, longboats, barges, towboats, cruisers, etc. zooming up and down. For the adventurous and easygoing. Not for family with young children, elders, physically disabled and easily queasy sensibilities. Ride at your own risk!"

There are lots to see at Wang Lang market especially the old vintage market with old clothing and antiques.- Finish your trip by visiting Yaowarat (Chinatown of Bangkok).

We enjoyed the water taxi experience and it was very cheap, clean and comfortable for the short trip. I was happy we go to experience the ferry/taxi. I am not sure though that I would choose to do the dinner or lunch boat experience, since there are many other things of interest in other parts of Thailand than to spend extra time in Bangkok."

The cheapest water taxi is the Orange Flag boat @ THB15 per person per way. These boats come along very regularly (every 15 / 20 min) and docks at each pier on either side of the river. You can either go Northbound or Southbound. Just make sure you embark /disembark the boat quickly, because the boat only stops for a short time at each pier before its off to the next stop. You can travel from Phra Arthit in the north to City Pier in the south in less than 30 minutes. Just keep your ticket for the duration of the trip to show the boat conductor that you had paid. You can get off at any pier in between to go sightseeing, visiting the temples or do shopping. Just keep in mind that once you got off, you have to pay THB15 for the next trip. Very convenient and fast way of transport especially when it is so humid and hot."

I thoroughly recommend taking the tourist boat cruise from Central Pier ( right by Saphan Taksin BTS Station) to Phra Arthit pier (in the backpacker area / Khao San Road) to get the best initial views of the tourist highlights in Bangkok and to orientate yourself. From the river you get great views and a commentary of all the major attractions for just 40 baht. After our initial trip we used the ferry boats that the locals used to get along the river (distinguishable by the orange, blue and green flags that the various companies operate under): at only 15 baht a trip. Being on board and watching how the boatman ( who attaches the mooring rope) and the boat \"driver\" operate these very long and awkward boats using just a series of whistle tones leaves you in disbelief; the river has a very swift current, there are numerous other boats on the river to dodge and the skill those guys display is quite amazing. It's a great way to spend an hour and the sights that you see as well as interaction with the locals going about their day makes for a memorable time"

Our second we travelled around on our own for 7 days and it was amazing. The water taxi is so cheap and the Chao Phraya is a huge river and main arterial route. The Grand Palace and many of the temples actually have river stops not to mention all the hotel restaurants etc. It is a simple easy way to get around. Everywhere we went was two events in one as you got a boat trip day and night and you got to your tourist destination or restaurant. We were conned by taxi drivers almost daily in the city on our first visit so this way you are travelling with locals and it was safe as it's government run. The river is wide - churns different colours depending on the weather - I've seen it deep blue and almost brown after a rain storm. You pass some fantastic impressive sites, you also pass the not so impressive signs of poverty and neglect. The further out you go you see the countryside flanking the bank. Even if you take one boat trip you will not be disappointed."

We took the BTS Skytrain from our local station, Nana on the Sukhumvit line and changed to the Silom Line at Siam (this is considered the centre of Bangkok). Get off at the river station which is called Saphan Taksin.There are different types of boats. For fun, we wanted to travel cheaply for 15 Baht with the locals. If you do too, look for the boats with the orange flags. For the orange locals boat, you buy a ticket on the boat, so head to the jetty on the left and join the queue that starts behind the ticket booth. Have your money ready to pay for your ticket on the boat. Most people use a 20 Baht note. The tourist boats have blue flags and cost around 100-150 Baht. For these, you need to buy a ticket from the booth. For your massive investment of 15 Baht, you get a one-way ticket and can get on and off any stops along the way. Be ready to get on and off the boat fairly quickly. Have a map so you can identify the stops as you go because their are no announcements and the signage is not easily spotted. For the Grand Palace, get off at Tha Chang.On the way home, repeat the process. There is a seated area where you can wait and you'll see people starting to move when the orange flagged boat arrives. Including BTS Skytrain fares, our entire transport costs were 288 Baht for 2 people and we had the satisfaction of doing it ourselves."

We have traveled the river in a number of ways: on a regular \"commuter\" boat, on a tourist long-boat, and on a crossing ferry from temple to temple. The public conveyences are shockingly inexpensive, and this and the commercial traffic moving up and down the river demonstrate how vital the river is to the day-to-day existence of Bangkok.It is definitely worth a visit for a view into an essential aspect of Bangkok life."

There is a ferry which goes around the river and there are pick up and drop points spread throughtout the city- ( one can google and find the route and stops) the fares are exteremely reasonable.There is also private boats youcan take- costing ~2000 Bhat. however this is costly- i got trapped first time and paid 1500 bhat for a single journey, which otherwise would be ~80Bhat in a shared boat."

Travelling on the public boats up and down the river is the best way to get around Bangkok - whether you want to get somewhere specific, or just enjoy the scenery.There are a few different types of public boats, but the orange flag ones are especially useful as cheap (currently 14 baht for any length of journey in one direction - this is much better value than the blue flag tourist boats and you get to travel with locals too) stop at almost every pier, and travel frequently in both directions (every 20 minutes during the day).If you haven't been to Bangkok before (or even if you have!) and you want to do some sightseeing, it's a cheap, cool and breezy, fun and convenient way to see much of the city in just an hour or two - just travel all the way to the end stop in one direction, and then travel all the way back again. You get good views of the city along the riverbanks and of the other boat traffic.Be ready to get on and off reasonably quickly, as they don't stop at any of the piers longer than necessary to unload and load passengers. Also keep an eye on the pier names/numbers as you get nearer your destination, as the announcements aren't always easy to hear.Check first boat times if wanting to travel very early, and last boat times if travelling around sunset, as the service only runs during daylight hours."

The Chao Phraya river is a busy waterway running through the heart of Bangkok. On our first visit to the city on leg one of a round the world trip we treated ourselves to a five star hotel over-looking the river - a last little bit of luxury before the back-packing ahead. From our high balcony the river is a working water way, big international liners slowly heave past, small but crazily long boat trains float past - several concrete platforms linked together carrying goods and somewhere on the middle ones you see a shack-like hut where the crew live aboard, hotel touristy junk boats whizz across the river turning suddenly, somehow narrowly avoiding each other, and then small individual long-tail Thai fishing and worker boats with their long whirring outboards zip about... it's an amazing place... Our hotel ran a tourist boat from the hotel to the main ferry points. Public ferries as well as tourist ferries run the length of the city and are a great way to cross the city - we picked the public ferry - there is a map with the stops and you just work out the nearest one to where you want to go - jump on and jump off - it's a pretty quick turnaround but great fun and much cheaper than the tourist ferries. If you're travelling up and down the city - take the Chao Phraya river at least once - the sights on the river and along the river bank are fascinating, and the river itself is the crazy busy lifeline of Bangkok.We visited Bangkok and the river several times over 2009 and 2010 - but I couldn't select these dates for the review below so it says 2013!"

You can also hire a speed boat that will wiz you around in no time but you dont really get to get off and see anything, just for fun and very pricey no set price so can get scammed big time here, especially if the taxi or chuck chuck drop you off, they get a commission."

First, I go with tourist boat (blue flag) which cost me THB40/way and ticket should be bought on ticket booth before boarding. In this boat all the passenger can sit and there's a English speaking tour guide that explain about tourism spot that we can visit in every pier, and it help us a lot with many kind of information. On the way back, I using orange flag boat that cost me only THB15 and pay on the boat. The sitting area on this boat are minim, and almost one-third of the passenger are standing. I really like standing on the back and feel the breeze...^_^. Don't try it for children cause it slippery."

At the end of the day we got on the wrong taxi and spent 30 minutes going the water route AWAY from Bangkok before we realized the error. The taxis are so crowded we did not realize that we were no longer on the tourist loop of the taxi (some of the taxis run multiple routes depending on the time) and, with no one speaking English, it was difficult to communicate our predicament. Just pay attention when boarding, because it gets crowded during rush hour and masses push their way onto the boats during the evening commute."

We usually catch a water taxi and go to the end of the line up the Chao Phraya River, its a nice cheap ride and you can get off at any of the stops along the river. The water taxi veers to both sides of the river and they travel regularly up and down the river throughout the day. Its a nice ride up the river and you can see all the houses that are along the river and all the buildings that also stand along the shores of the river. The ride is pleasant although is sometimes very busy and full of people going to various places along the way. Well worth the ride even if you dont really have a destination."

During my time in Bangkok I took one of the long boat tours down the Chao Phraya River which made a change from being in the centre of Bangkok. Our tuk-tuk driver took us to one of the river piers and then waited for us to return from the boat trip. We hired one of the long boats from the pier which took us along the river and down one of the tributaries to see the floating houses that are on stilts over the river. The tour took us past The Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, the Royal Barges Museum and the Wat Talingchan Floating Market. Initially the boat ride was quite smooth, but then the river gets quite wide and the waves are quite large for the long boats. However the driver handled the boat well. The whole tour along the river took about two and a half hours including the time we spent in the Wat Arun temple. There are many hotels and restaurants alongside the river that have outside terraces where you can sit and relax along the river."

Hop on a ferry at any one of many piers and for 15-20 baht you can hop off anywhere the boat stops. Trying to hop off before the boat stops is not advisable!These ferry boats are used as a mainstream form of public transport and are often crammed but this is all part of the fun. Stand or sit back if you are lucky and watch the panorama of Bangkoks riverside as you glide past. 'Glide' possibly not the best description as these boats do sway about a bit and the river can get a little choppy.My favourite route is from the Sathorn Pier right up to Tha Nonthonburi for a visit to the markets. An hour or so up the river on the boat, a walk around an area with very few tourists, cruise back. All for 30 baht! Give it a go. "

There are huge rice barges being towed by seemingly small tugs, there are the tourist long tail boats heading for the floating markets, the water taxis crisis crossing from one side to the other-such variety. You pass by huge five star hotels, many Wats-significant as well as the ordinary, government buildings, Thai housing etc etc. It's a fast flowing river and at one time was almost choked with water hyacinth but now there is very little of it to be seen.

I took the orange flag one for 15 Baht. But do get off quickly, cause I did see tourists miss their stop because they didn't get off in time. And of course it was crowded. The other option is the tourist express boat (40 Baht or 150 Baht for whole day). The night market, Asiatique, also has a free shuttle boat from Sathon Pier. The nights that I stayed in Bangkok, there was always something going on at the Chao Praya River, either fireworks (2 different nights) or a soccer match on a huge boat.

One way ticket 15 baht. It is the more economical option but the backside is that the boats don't run as frequent as the tourist boats - so be prepared to wait.Option 3.

The boat is a refurbished old rice barge so is not very large. Everyone seated for dinner had a good view of the river and the food was a really tasty selection of various Thai dishes.There was a very pretty girl playing a traditional Thai stringed instrument and another very pretty girl performing traditional Thai dances as we enjoyed our dinner.The views of the various lighted stupas along the river were spectacular at night. As a civil engineer I especially enjoyed the light playing on the cables of the new cable stayed bridge as we passed under it.."

The river cruise in Bangkok reminded me of the river cruise in Bur Dubai though the Bangkok cruise was bigger, swankier and more organized. A 2-hour cruise through the Chao Phraya river giving us good views of the city on both sides of the bank, we spent decent time on the double-decked mini cruise liner. Every guest has a table reserved for them for dinner. We got one on the lower deck but they graciously put us to the upper deck on request. For the ones who prefer AC, the lower deck is idle. For the ones who like open air dining, the upper deck is apt (though its not as windy in Bangkok). Our cruise - 'River Star Princess' was entirely dedicated to Indian tourists (who comprise the biggest percentage of tourists in Bangkok other than the Chinese). So the food was perfectly Indian and even the live singing on the cruise featured only Indian chartbusters. Interestingly the host and singer was a Thai female who sang with an accent but got every word from Hindi songs correct. If you are not the singing-dancing types, you could simply sit on the tip of the open deck and spend some serene time on Thai waters. Chao Phraya River cruise is decent for a one-time experience!"

We had a blast. Everyone had a turn singing and got up dancing. Great views from the boat. We had people in our group who were inside the boat on the lower level and they hated it so I assume it must be very different atmosphere DEFINITELY book for the top deck. Food was fairly average and I must admit it is very hot when the boat is going the opposite way to the wind. Only complaint was that when you arrive you are left in a expensive shopping complex with no where to sit for over an hour waiting to leave on the cruise this was very disappointing and something we did not enjoy especially in the heat. Would highly recommend this tour. I booked through Bangkok tours online before arriving in Thailand and I recommend this."

It offers some great sights from more local areas to some of the main attractions but the one thing that stood out for me was the amount of catfish. We first boarded on the Thewes Pier and to see the catfish here was amazing. They were fighting each other for a spot of water never mind air or food. Then when crossing the river they were continually popping up everywhere. They are big fish too and I would have hated to have fallen in as I would thought you'd struggle to keep you head up. Use the transport on the river it is a great alternative and you have to see the fish. Amazing."

As we were getting out of the station, we were approached by a friendly guy giving us direction to China Town. Then he tells us it's too far to walk to China town and it's dangerous due to the protest going on so it's better for us to take Tooktook for 50 Baht. It turns out he was a tooktook driver so we get on his tooktook. Then he tries to convince us to get on the boat which will take us to the temples and even throw in a sightseeing of the beautiful canals. Where he took us, there was a lady sitting at a desk telling us she can have us see first the temples and then the canal all in 1.5 hours for whopping price of 2400 baht. After giving them almost all we had in our wallet, the boat driver takes us on to a remote canal first killing more than 30 minutes of time slowly sailing through filthy canal to get to a shady area where a small boat with tons of tourist souvenirs approached us calling his boat a \"Floating Market\". We told him we didn't have money and were not interested. He was pushing us to buy a beer for our boat driver. We expressed our frustration to the boat driver stating our understanding was that we were supposed to visit the temples first. He finally took us to the first temple which we spent most of the time looking for an ATM to withdraw more cash to buy the tickets to enter the temple. By this point, I was very upset at myself that I bought into this expensive private boat scam. I ended our boat tour after the first temple and told the boat driver to take us back to China Town. It left a very unpleasant memory of Bangkok.Do yourself a favor and do your homework - know all your transportation options (there's public ferry option too) and costs before you make your way out there. If you can gather more people to hop on the private boat to share the cost, it totally is not worth paying 2400 baht (80 US dollars) for 90 minute boat ride for two people."

We have enjoyed spending time on and around the river during many trips here and consider this a fun place to spend time in Bangkok. There are restaurants, rooftop bars and sky bars with excellent views of the river for visitors to enjoy. Similarly, you can stay at riverside hotels in several areas of the city, allowing you to view the temples on the other side at various times of the day, evening and night. We recently stayed at the Sala Arun hotel, near Wat Po. From here, there were excellent views of the imposing Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn) just across the river. This was a reasonably priced hotel that we would recommend for those interested to stay along the river in a convenient location. Rooftop bars like Eagle Nest and Sala Rattanakosin make for great places to catch a sundowner while admiring the Chao Phraya River views. Some good riverside restaurants in this area include Bitter Deck, ESS Deck, and The Deck. Meals are a bit pricey but we found the food quality in these restaurants to be quite good. Views were very impressive. One of the fun activities that we enjoyed on the Chao Phraya River during our recent trip was watching the catfish being fed near Wat Rakang. Here you can buy fish pellets or bags of bread (\u0e3f10-20) and feed the the thousands of large catfish, waiting near the pier. It is considered good luck to feed the fish and and there was a constant stream of locals doing so, making for an ongoing feeding frenzy in the waters around the pier. Tourist boats were stopping by as well, allowing passengers can throw bread into the water to fish the fish. You can do the same at the pier next to Wat Arun but the fish are smaller and in much reduced numbers. You can also take tourist boat trips up and down the Chao Phraya. These are found at most ferry piers, along with public transportation ferry boats and simply ferry crossings, which can take you back-and-forth, across the Chao Phraya for as little as \u0e3f3 per ride. Overall, we very much enjoyed spending time near the Chao Phraya River during our recent trip to Bangkok and can recommend visitors to Bangkok try to allocate some time to do something along the river during their trip to the city."

You can get there easily from BTS (Saphan Taksin station)."

Tha Chang (Stop 9) in the north - next to the Royal Palace, and Sathorn Taksin (Central Stop) in the south - next to Taksin bridge and Skytrain station.On the boat there is a section reserved for monks at the back. You pass a number of sights - most notably Wat Arun, Temple of Dawn. Next to this is a small white fort - home to the Thai Royal Navy. After this another temple Wat Kanlayanamit. Just before Taksin you pass the Oriental Hotel. If you go north from the Royal Palace stop you will go under the impressive Rama VIII Bridge."

He met us a the jetties at the back of the Royal Palace (where he shooed off the con-men trying to charge people to walk on the jetty) took us to his personally owned, long-tail - which was immaculate and his pride and joy - and took us out for two hours on THE of the most enjoyable trip that we have done in the ten years we have lived in Thailand. I cannot recommend this highly enough. We saw fantastic, old-style, Thai houses, kids swimming in the khlongs, waving and chatting with us, HUGE Monitor Lizards swimming and sun-bathing, beautiful wats and people going about their daily lives and businesses in areas of Bangkok that most tourists (and many locals) never see. Periodically, we would stop at attractions and he would take picture for us. It was so relaxing, informative and romantic that it really was the best day trip out I have done in years.Oh yes! The whole two hours was VERY cheap! Too cheap, in fact, for me to write the price on here, as I feel he should charge more and also that he might have given us a special price because of our mutual friends. Even so, we would gladly have paid a lot more for the fun we had.

The easiest way is to go to the booth and buy a tourist ticket, at the time of writing this is a mere 70 Baht for all day unlimited trips.Another good way to see the sights is FREE!, The major hotels have free shuttle boats and will take you to the riverside hotels for absolutely no charge, remember all falangs look the same, and they have no idea if you are staying there anyway. Best trip is to the Anantar Riverside, about 15 mins and you are at the hotel where you can walk round the gardens etc. maybe have a drink, but there is nothing mush outside the hotel, so just enjoy the river trip. Back to the pier, and another boat will be there in minutes to take you back to Sapan Taksin. You can now go to The Hilton, Sheraton, or Peninsular etc. have a look round and get dropped off at River City, next to the Sheraton, for a bit of window shopping or some food. A good afternoon out for next to nothing with lots of photo opportunities.A clear fresh breeze comes down the river, a real breath of fresh air. and easy to get back to the city from Sapan Taksin by Skytrain BTS."

There are a variety of tour boats, water taxis, dinner cruises and ferries that run on the river, as well as working boats and barges. There are a number of canals branching off the river into residential neighborhoods. We took a 2 hour cruise which spent half the time on the river, and the rest wandering the canals. At night the river is wonderful. The river comes alive with boat traffic...especially the brightly lit dinner cruise boats. The major temples are also illuminated, and the hotels and restaurants add to the beauty. From the river Chinatown and the flower market are nearby. This is a great place to stay when in Bangkok....hotels, restaurants, shopping, transportation and a beautiful, entertaining locale."

The Tourist Boat goes from Central Pier/ Sathorn all the way Khaosan Road and as you can get on and off where you like you can see more than one area in a day, if you have the energy in the heat and humidity!

We paid the 150 Baht ($5) per person for all the day pass which is fantastic value. We started by taking the express boat (which stops at about 8 of the piers) all the way up and all the way back just to see Bangkok from the river then we transferred over to the standard boat (all included in the same price) so we could go further up the river (this one does 30 piers) and also stop at the various piers whose attractions we wanted to see. I suggest you google the Chao Phraya tourist boat to see the extensive list of attractions and markets available at the pier stops. This is a must do in Bangkok"

We only realised that it was a scam at the end of the day.A Thai woman came up to us when we were walking near the Grand Palace, pretending to make small talk and told us that the Grand Palace was closed for lunch and prayers, and recommended us to take a cruise, which we were planning to take anyway, after visiting the Grand Palace. She told us to go to this particular jetty, where they will charge only 800Baht, and not another jetty because they will charge very high like 3000Baht. In actual fact, the latter jetty had police patrolling around. She said a tuktuk ride to the former jetty will only cost 20Baht. Just after she said that, 2 tuktuks came to stop beside us and we happily took them. Upon reaching the jetty, a man welcomed us and told us that the cruise is 800Baht per person. We managed to haggle it down to 600Baht and went ahead to take the cruise.Overall, the cruise was interesting at first as we got to see the villages and old houses on water, some temples and even people selling souvenirs on their boats. It got a little too long and draggy though. I would still recommend it if you visit Bangkok, as it is a very unique attraction apart from all the shopping and temple visiting.Do beware of the scams, they are everywhere in Bangkok and they like to target tourists travelling in groups. We realised that we were tricked because from online reviews, some people paid only 200-300Baht per person for the cruise. And recalling what happened to us, everything actually happened at the right place and the right time. They are all a syndicate. Was the Grand Palace really closed on that day? Nobody knows."

You can catch all boats from the Central Pier at Sapthan Taksin BTS station. They run till 7-8 pm at night. The tourist boats are priced at 150 BHT whole day and comes with English speaking commentary. You might want to consider these if you intend to do many stops along the river otherwise just use the local orange/green flag boats."

Make sure you have a tourist map showing the river with piers numbered. Sathom is N1 and each pier is clearly numbered N2, N3 etc. towards the Grand Palace. If you get confused just ask anybody for the 'ferry' !In busy times the boats get crazily overloaded but the ticket collector squeezes through no matter what. Pay on the pier or when aboard. These little people scream their orders to move on down the boat but fight your way to the rail and stand firm. Your fare of just 15 baht will take you any distance. Hop off at any place, take a walk, especially from the university from the Grand Palace along the river side walkway to another pier and pay your 15 baht again. It won't break the bank if you make a mistake and go the wrong way or miss your destination.The experience is amazing. Watch the river life unfold and relax."

The tourist boat come every 30min. Express boat have many line and price but during day and the best line for ordinary people and tourist is Yellow flag line (Thong leung) and Orange flag line (Thong Som) you can see the flag above the end of boat. Express boat price yellow flag is 20 baht/line, orange flag is 15 baht/one way one day pass of tourist boat can be use in express boat, the boat come every 15-30 min.Important point is if you start form Central pier that connect with sky train, Express boat and Tourist boat always come in the same time and at another pier, express boat is come often than tourist boat and stop at same station (In website they told tourist boat stop at Maharaj pier that near to Grand palace and Emerald buddha it's not true, Maharaj pier is cancelled you can stop at Tha-Chang pier that more closed to Grand palcae). So if you only go by express boat it's not necessary to buy one-day pass 150 baht can buy 10 ticket for express boat! The Pro for Tourist boat is 1. It's larger (always have seat available) 2. They have guide on the boat (but guide isn't help, some staff have poor english) 3. less people because it's more expensive. If you want large boat and take a seat select tourist boat. If you want to save money, you should use express boat and buy one way ticket,oh! don't forget to prepare enough 20 baht bank notes or coins."

Since then I stay at other hotels 'downtown' but ALWAYS return to the River to soak up the ambience. This 'working' River with all its boat whistles, hoots and boat engine sounds in the distance is a pleasant contrast to the hustle and bustle of downtown Bangkok. An enjoyable afternoon can be had by catching the BTS to Saphan Taksin Stn and walking the short distance to the Shangrila for a Wine and the great view of the River. Then walking to the Oriental to 'soak up' the charm and history of this great hotel, then a boat across the River to the Peninsula to experience one of the finest hotels in the country, then a free hotel boat back across the River to the Royal Orchid Sheraton for a wine poolside (the 2nd pool downstairs) then at about 4.45pm jump on a free boat back across the River to the Hilton Millennium Hotel and take the lift to the top and visit the 360 Bar. Best views of the Chao Phraya and a special deal.. buy 1 drink and get 1 free (beer or wine). The 360 Bar opens 5pm and even though it's only the 32nd floor, it's the best view in Bangkok. From here you can get a free Hotel boat back to Saphan Taksin BTS. FYI - The Royal Orchid Sheraton has a very good Beatles cover band every Monday and Wednesday night from 9pm.

Unfortunately the info is not too much in English (so better get preparation by browsing it before). They didn't give enough informaton about route info, cost average etc, and even where we need to take line up queque. But BASICALLY they offert 2 different services which is BLUE TOURIST BOAT service (1 day whole pass about 150B, which is pay on the locket) and ORDINARY RIVER BOAT (it depends the route 'flag' colour, which is around 15B for 1 trip which is pay on the boat). 1. BLUE TOURIST BOAT, which is cost abot 150B for one day trip usually they will offering to any tourist once they approaching on the locket. Actually they are not scam, they do honest and just to sell their business and it's depend on us to use their service. The lack of info is they may not inform us that other possible ORDINARY RIVER BOAT way is available. And they also stop only some pier like ORIENTAL (N1), SIPHRAYA (N3), RACHAWONGSE/Chinatown (N5), THATIEN/Watpho (N8). THACHANG/Grand Palace (N9), WANGLANG/Local Market (N10), PHRAARTIT (N13). And in the afternoon they also adding to ASIATIQ Pier (see their booklet for more info schedule). So, BLUE TOURIST BOAT :* If you planned whole day to visit some/every tourism place on that Pier, it's good to use this service since ticket is 1 day valid and no need to hassle for paying boat fee. Just show the ticket.* Boat providing English spoken guide and they will give tourism information alongside the river and the next Pier that boat will stop.* Excluded area on the pier while awaiting the boat arrive. Also their staff will calling tourist to ready and help them in/out from vessel* Boat is not too crowded with people, easy to get chair to sitdown* Only more time needed when waiting the boat coming, seem they dont have much boat in operating (expect about 30min to wait the boat)2. ORDINARY RIVER BOAT :Normally they are some service boat with some colour, but we recommend to use ORANGE FLAG. It's the fastest, cheapest, travel and stop almost in every PIER. The fee will be billed by officer once you aboard onthe vessel. It's give a little waiting time in PIER comparin with BLUE TOURIST BOAT service but much crowded people onthe vessel and line up of queque (especially in the morning/afternoon rush hour). Well, imagine that non tourist Thai people will commonly use this ORANGE FLAG service as well when travelling between the pier.And for other boat services, if you need to cross the river, looking for boat with mark FERRY BOAT SERVICE. But not every PIER have this FERRY service, normally only on CENTRAL PIER, THATHIEN (N8)/Watpo to WatArum and THACHANG (N9)/GrandPalace to N10.Also if you stay in some big hotel alongside river, they may provide their own boat service/shuttle. Usually the boat will have different design, like wooden one."

Left and right of the river, as the cruise gradually glides through, unfold to us some wonders by night in Bangkok, the like of WAT Arun, The Grand Palace, The Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the wonderful Rama VIII suspension, expensive bridge. Dinner was served under candle light, in buffet style with array of choices from authentic Thai to International cuisine. We had our sumptuous meal, while being entertained by a live professional singer, from the Philippines, too versatile to render romantic songs and pop to jazz music, inviting guests of different nationalities to dance with friends at upper deck disco floor. It took us almost 2 hours of camaraderie and fun, no barrier can ever break the joy and cheer of everyone filled with excitement and wonders at its beauty of the surroundings.

Tourist boats cost double or more than the locals' ferries and include some \"narration\" of the stops -- which was so heavily accented that it was almost indecipherable. They will also try to sell you a day pass for 150THB -- only good if you will be traveling four or more segments in one day -- if not, just pay by the segment. The tourist boats go a bit more slowly and are more gentle in off loading passengers, while the locals' ferries are fast, efficient, and fun -- the bang into the pier and people hop off and on in seconds and then, off again! If you can't get a locals boat at the Central Pier, try to take one later in the day.You can organize your own river tour by using the ferries -- a trip to the end is only 40THB or less, so double that for round trip. It is very scenic along the way and spectacular at night as you see Wat Arun in magnificent silhouette, and the Grand Palace sparkling from the lights on its cut glass mosaic facades. (note that the Grand Palace lights turn on when the boat approaches on the river and turn off once it passes). You can exit on one of the pier for the large, fancy hotels and have a drink to watch the lights of the city, or get off at the Chinatown exit and spend a few hours in the very large and vibrant section of Bangkok -- go during the weekday when people are out shopping to see all manner of things -- many you will see for the first time. We found these boats to be fun, fast and efficient -- uniquely Bangkok experience."

The water is not clean, so don't expect pristine surroundings, but there is something about water that is calming."

We started walking from our hotel (Lebua) to the pier near Shangri La but a lovely tuk tuk driver told us this was an expensive pier to catch the boat from and for 20baht would take us somewhere cheaper. Joke!!! He took us just down the road to another pier where we were told it would cost 1500baht per person. We only had 1600 between us. After we said we couldn't afford it they halved it and charged 1500 for the two of us. We were told we'd see a heap of landmarks and get to walk around while the boat waited for us, then return to the same pier. Joke! The boat was falling apart and I'm pretty sure it was taking on water. We got soaked by the disgusting water that was full of dead fish and rubbish. Had to change clothes, underwear and all, and wash our hair after that. It was disgusting. The boat driver was extremely rude. We didn't see any of the landmarks we were told we would then when we were up a canal and out of sight of anyone he demanded the money we had left on our wallets. We gave him the little amount we had left and he demanded more in euros or dollars! We had nothing on us so said he'd take us to an ATM! Realising we were being robbed I yelled at him in my 'I'm not taking this nonsense' tone and he reluctantly got moving. I was willing to jump overboard and swim for it if he continued. After fleecing us of any cash we had left he dropped us at a completely different pier over 10kms from where we got on with no money to get home. Disgusting, dirty, shameless man. Do yourself a favour and just view pictures of this river online. That would be better than actually riding it. If you must ride the river go on the Chao Phraya Tourist Boat for 40baht per person. Tickets are available in board. Avoid the privately run long boats at all costs."

It is a totally new experience to be on the boat along the old and new developments of the riverside. The type of the boat you choose will affect the experience as well. Certainly it is a quicker way to travel rather than getting stuck in the traffic jam.We were staying at Shangri La and the Central Pier is just next to the Hotel and our destination is the Reclining Buddha ( Wat Pho ) and the Palace. I read at TA to wait for an orange flag boat and it will cost us THB15. We were told at the counter that the orange flag would not arrive till an hour later and we were short of time- so we took the 'sampan' like boat which I guess the one people refer as the long tail ?? It costs THB 100 per person and we shared with about 10 other people. I don't know about you, but for me stepping down into the boat from the pier with a foot of water in between and the boat swaying further was an intimidating experience. We were given life jackets and the boat cruise in various speed with occasional spray. It was pleasant with water gleaming in the sun. When we reached Pier no. 8; I found it easier to step up; however a lady behind me fell right on her back, and when she gained strength to try again only to fall on her knee at the pier.From the Palace we walked to Pier no. 9, and was quoted THB 200 per person to r eturn to Central Pier ! We walked to the right where there was another booth and THB 40/person ! After ten minutes waiting the boat/ferry arrived- this one is the same level as the pier- thanks God ! It has blue flag and only made 5 stops to Central Pier - like every other stop. Half way- all seats were taken- lots of people standing, while someone on microphone kept on repeating in English and Thai the destinations. It was not as pleasant as our first trip and it took half an hour including waiting despite they are pretty fast in stopping and starting at every stop.Of course, another experience and a lot pleasant one would be the cruise dinner which is a totally different ambience instead of trying to get from point A to B !"

Renting a long boat was quoted to us at 1500 THB for an hour, so we opted for the cheaper and more public transport route and bought day passes on the Chao Phraya Tourist Boat for 150 THB each. The Central Pier, where we bought our passes, is right by one of the Sky Train stops (S6-Saphan Taksin), so it's really easy to get to the river via public transportation from just about any hotel in Bangkok. The nice thing about the day pass is that you have unlimited on and off priveleges, and you also get a nice little guide of the highlights of each of the 8 pier stops. We really enjoyed Chinatown (Ratchawongse Pier), Wat Pho (Tha Tien Pier), The Grand Palace & Wat Phra Kaeo (Tha Chang Pier), and Phra Arthit Road and Banglumpoo Market (Phra Athit Pier). Definitely take the tourist boat from Central Pier all the way to Phra Athit Pier once so that you see the entire section of the river that the tourist boat runs. And, yes, the river is dirty...not a big surprise in a city of this size.Be sure to travel the river at least once at night so that you see the night lights...the night skyline is beautiful, and the view of Wat Arun lit up at night is amazing. Be prepared for some close quarters on the boat during busy times...we found weekdays 9-10am and 4-6pm to be really busy."

Lighting on all of the buildings make them stand out and give a grandeur to the city.While you wait for the start of the cruise,thai girls in their traditional dresses welcome you and pose with you for photographs,which one can purchase for 200Bht.The food is traditional & continental both.There is music on board with singing & dancing,which makes the cruise entirely enjoyable.No matter how many times you go,every time is as enjoyable as the first."

Take a candlelit dinner teak boat along the river - we went with Wan fan which was very good (small boat as opposed to large and impersonal one). All life is on this river. The boats go fairly frequently, you just need to suss out the blue, green and orange flags!"

Unknown to us there were demonstrations and protests by the yellow shirts(democrats) against the red shirts- the government, when we landed. Consequently our pre booked tour was cancelled. However the gem of a duty manager -Benz - at The Landmark hotel, found us a way round this- to avoid any processions along the roads she suggested we take take the sky train and then the canal boat to our destinations.This is how we came across a wonderful sail-along the river and we also booked a tour in the boat round the canals and the villages that still exist in the old part of Bangjkojk along the water's edge. It was SO relaxing- we were the only ones on the boat, we saw the LOVELY giant water lizard- he was massive I thought we were approaching a croc ! The people in the houses waving to us, a couple of folk trying to sell us souveniers from their boats, everyone was so friendly.We stopped off at the rickety pier and were en route to our visit of The Grand Palace etc. Sailing back was just as relaxing- seeing the huge tall skyscrapers is quite awesome, the old temples look quite pretty in comparison to all the new builds along the water edge, seeing all the variety of boats on the river is also interesting. Such a breath of fresh air away from all the bustle and pollution of the roadway system."

            "review": "A great experience at an affordable price for young and old and all ages in between.. The best place to start is Sathorn Taksin. This is the \u2018central pier\u2019 and you get there by taking the Silom branch of the BTS (skytrain) to \u201cSathorn Taksin\u201d station then get out and walk downward towards the river\u2026just follow the crowd downwards staying under the BTS skyrail overhead tracks. It is just a couple of hundred metres to the water\u2019s edge and the pier head. You will see 3 short piers ahead of you. The righthand one is for chartering the longtail boat privately if you wish and have the money. Go for the central pier which has a small kiosk with 2 openings and both people speak good English.Now do not buy The\u201d Tourist Express Boat\u201d ticket unless you plan to be on the river all day as you can take any of the other ferries very cheaply. My wife and I took the longest ferry boat up to Nonthaburi and back which is 1.25 hours each way with about a 15 minute break at the far end. That cost us 15 bhat each plus the same for the return journey. Remember that you pay on the boat and try to sit at the outer edge of the boats for the best view. Therefore if you are late in the group boarding, we suggest, consider waiting for the next boat but do not lose you place in the queue.Despite the heat of Bangkok, averaging mid 30\u2019s in January there is a breeze which will keep you cool but put on sunblock if you want protection.The exchange rate is about to deteriorate again but at the moment it is 50+ bhat to the UK pound and the full ferry fare is 15 bhat! Children will like this trip only if they are tall enough to see over the edge of the boat but Mum\u2019s and Dads keep your eye on them. Perhaps the little ones could sit on your lap and get a good view however I do not think they will want to stay put for 1.25 hours each way.Buy a map (street plan before you come) or visit any branch of \u201cAsia books\u201d when in Bangkok and know the stops either number S\u2026 followed by a number going South or N followed by a number for North. We went north. Of course this is a very easy way to get to the Imperial Palace which is by the river although quite a walk to the entrance! This is called N9 (The Chang Ferry Pier) \u2026 if you tell the boat conductress \u201cThe Chang \u201c and draw N9 in the palm of your hand and even say \u2018Palace\u2019, she will understand and charge you the right amount. However you still need a map as you have to recognise when you have reached the right location.Usually when you get to a Ferry Pier there is a little interconnecting ferry to reach attractions on the other side of the river. Many of the stops are NOT near road bridges and it has been a couple of years since we used these interconnecting ferries but they should be very cheap. Beware of central Bangkok though so have a bunch of local coins in your hands when inviting the ferryman to take you across the river, do not be displaying notes! Be wise as Westerners are perceived as rich and some (not all) will see you as a target. We tell you this because you will need the \u2018your interconnnecting ferry boat to cross to Wat Arun from N8 after you have been to The Imperial Palace at N9.  Area. It looks tat by day but it is very different at night.N8 is called \u201cThian Pier\u201d but pronounced \u201cTian\u201d. Remember to point at Wat Arun in plain sight across the river. Remember Wat Pho pronounced \u2018Wat Poh\u2019is at N8 and there is no need to cross the river\u2026(Reclining emerald Buddha). We think that both the Imperial Palace, Wat Pho and Wat Arun are your three \u2018must see\u2019 sights\u2026.. although there are plenty of others. Remember City traffic can be frightful so take trains and the Ferries to keep the costs down and have an adventure.Now back to the ferry trip (more like a cruise). OK for the walking infirm because there is not much walking but you have to be ready at the ferry exit when it is your stop and remember these boats get packed in high season. Use the handrails. Now if you are a wheelchair user I think you are better off using a private longtail boat or arranging the trip through a travel agent who will probably charter a longtail boat for you. We still recommend the ferry experience because it is thrilling to ride the crest of the prow wave and the ever changing scenery. This trip will definitely lift your spirit. HOWEVER NOTE WE SAW NO TOILETS ON THE FERRIES so \u2018go before you go\u2019.If you are young single adult (20\u2019s) this trip is still for you as N13 \u201cBanglamphoo\u201d is the area to reconnoitre your evening hotspots\u2026clubs/bars. You just walk inland until you get to The Khao San RoadIt is is often called \u201cPra Artit\u201d actually Phra Arthit but when you have done your scouting get to Phra Sumen (a little riverside fort) which is just minutes from the Ferry Pier, enjoy a brief rest in the gardens before heading back.Be blessed and go home with some wonderful memories.Kind Regards.Chris & AnnaPS Mums and Dads, space on the boat is so tight that I did not see one buggy anywhere on a boat. They may have a minimum age restriction so check on the internet before you go."

Take BTS Skytrain to Saphan Taksin and proceed to Oriental Pier where you can purchase boat tickets. I would suggest buying a one-day pass and board the Chao Phraya Tourist Boat. Along the river bank, one would see the way of life of the local people living in dilapidated and stilted houses, temples, famous hotels like the Oriental Hotel, etc. You'll probably need to spend a day here because along the bank, there are some famous temples like Wat Phra Kaeo (Temple of Emerald Buddha, get off at Maharaj Pier), Wat Pho (Temple of Reclining Buddha, get off at Tha Tien Pier) and Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn). There are admission fees for these temples. Wat Phra Kaeo charges 500 bahts whereas the other two 100 bahts. Besides these temples, you can stop at Rajchawong Pier to visit Chinatown and Wang Lang Pier to visit Khao San, famous for backpackers. Do spend the evening at the Asiatique, a large shopping mall where you can buy souvenirs. There are many restaurants and I would recommend a Thai restaurant called Baan Khanitha which overlooks the river. The night scene is very different from the day so spending the evening here will give you two versions."

It pays to get a day pass if you plan on going to 3 or more stops. The river itself is brown and dirty but being on it all day with the boats gives you a real sense of life in the area. The river bank is lined with temples and hotels to floating markets and dilapidated houses.

One of the best ways to experience Bangkok is by taking the public ferry up past the 5 star hotels to some of the most amazing temples and sights in Bangkok. Simply catch the BTS to Saphan Taksin station and it is a 2min walk to the public ferry. Once aboard the ferry why not get off at Tha Tien stop and have a look at the Grand Palace and Wat Pho (reclining buddha temple). These are both must visit attractions. Once you are finished you can walk back to the pier and pay just 3 baht for a different ferry to the opposite side of the river to have a look at Wat Arun (temple of the dawn). This should take up several hours for some and possibly a full day for others. I always do this trip at least 2 or 3 times when in Bangkok as I enjoy the river and temples so much. If so desired, you can stop off at the peninsula or shangri la hotel on your way for some truly fantastic food."

I very much enjoyed our excursion on the river, the average rating mostly reflects that this is not a must do in Bangkok nor is it a major attraction for me. However, I do recommend it and believe even families with children will enjoy a tailboat ride through the canals of Bangkok. Being less adventuresome than my fellow travelers ( I envy your taking the local way of hoping on and off the tailboats and exploring), we did our site seeing as part of my city private tour. We started in the middle of the afternoon at the height of the heat/humidity and explored many of the canals along the city. Our guide not overly intrusive, pointing out famous landmarks or letting us just enjoy the breeze and sights of the city. Unlike in the US where mansions are only found along the river, the canal is the life blood of the city-- many very poor people live and work along the canal. Some only having access to the outside world via the canal. So, either be adventurous and jump on a boat like our fellow TA writers suggest, or take a nice guided tour of the river as I did as part of a tour. The evening tours are also very nice as the city is lit up at night. The boats are not for the handicap or hard to get around person- i am not very nimble and had a hard time (it was very choppy day) getting on and off. I skinned my knee getting off; but, it is well worth a trip through the real part of the city."

As soon as you get out the train you'll see that sign that say boat ride to Grand Palace, Wat Arun and Wat Po for 5o00 baht. You will then directed to get to the boat. I saw the boat a bigger one like a ferry. I sat down with my son right away but we were told to go down the boat. I looked down and see the small tiny boat below...looked a kayak boat only a little bigger with a motor. OMG..my heart start pounding because it was so low and so small and so narrow like you are riding a skate board. Well there is no even time to think because they grabbed you and rushed into the boat with the rest of the tourists. When the boat started moving I screamed as it goes so fast and it goes up due to the waves then it smack you back down not to mention the tilting left and right. OMG...It feel as like the boat would split in half and goes realllllly fassttt. I screamed the whole time and i thought that was the end of me. The driver pointed at Wat Arun but no one even bother to look as everyone holding for their lives.The ride is the longest 30 min. in my life. What's worse is there is no one single life jacket. How can you ride a boat, paid 500 baht and no life jacket? It's a joke. It's suicide riding the express boat. This is a warning. If they rush you in into this tiny boat, wave your hands and say you want the other boat/ferry. The good thing is the Grand Palace is right there when you get off boat."

Three of us had wonderful food, several Singha beers, and all for less than $25. Then take the boat back to Central. What you will see is how the Thais actually live along the river.

The river is full of boat traffic with everything from traditional Thai longtail boats to massive multi-tugboat barges, and the city's development right up to the water's edge is interesting to watch as you pass by.We frequently travel on the Chao Phraya Express Boats ferries as a way to travel around the city; you can take the SkyTrain to the Saphan Taksin stop, and then it's about a 45 second walk to the Sathorn ferry pier (which is the main pier of the ferry service). There will be people telling you that you need to purchase a \u0e3f150/person all-day ferry ticket, but you can ignore them; when you ignore them, they will tell you that you still need to pay \u0e3f150 and you can't get in the boat. However, once the boat pulls up they will finally get out of the way and let you board, and it's only \u0e3f15/person to ride the public ferry. All of the ferries travel the river flying different flags, and it's important to note the color of the flag; orange flags are the \u0e3f15 public ferries, but blue flags are the more expensive tourist boats for \u0e3f40/person. The ferry makes a trip down a large segment of the river, and from Sathorn you can get to Tha Tien (near the Grand Palace and Wat Pho) or Phra Arthit (the closest stop to Khao San Road). If you want to ride the river, but don't want to take the ferry, there are other options. From Saphan Taksin there are a variety of hotels across the river, and many of them offer free hotel shuttle ferries across the river; you can tell them you're staying at the hotel for a free trip, or you can grab a drink at a hotel bar and be a legitimate customer without lying. Another option is to take the \u0e3f3 ferry from Tha Tien (near Wat Pho) across the river to Wat Arun. And, as yet another option, there are luxury dinner cruises that will take you out on the river for sunset and feed you a delicious meal."

There are a million operator of night cruises, the view is always lovely, however beware that the food they served. It is pretty much the same - horrible. So the best way to enjoy the river is to take an early morning tourist boat ride at Saphan Taksin around 9:30 am when the boats arent too crowded. It is breezy and not as hot as later on during the day. The boat ride takes about 1:30 hr the last station, then you get out and then go to the pier next door to catch a boat back. You can also hop on and off the tourist boat whenever and wherever you want. Then in the evening, go up to 360 :ounge at Millennium Hilton hotel for sunset drinks, you will get a bird's eye view of the rive, then pick a restaurant by the river to enjoy some good foodof your choice."

I had planned my second day to visit grand palace by rent a boat to cross the river.. In my way there i had bumped into a random thailand guy who said the grand palace was closed until 12.00 pm(at that time is 10.30 am), so he recommended us to take a boat rental to get a tour by boat for 1hour while wait for the grand palace to open and he was,''generously '' get a tuk tuk for us just 20baht about 3km ride to the pier.. At the pier we had charged for 2100baht for 3person but i bargain 600baht each person and she said okay.. My expectation had been already high, but instead we get the city view, we all get trash, green moss, dirty water and slum residence along the river... So it's not even worth the money, time and energy we spent... Don't bother to even rent a boat.. It was my deepest regret while I was in Bangkok.. And FYI the closed Grand Palace is the biggest scam in Bangkok.. You better watch out!"

Wanting to head down the river a few stops to china town we were told it would cost 600 baht for 2 people, crazy money. So we paid 3 baht pr person to get on the ferry to take us to the other side of the river, once on the other side of the river the helpful staff sold us the ticket to china town one way for 15 baht....simple.It would be helpful to have better signing coming from the Khao san road area but this im guessing is where they make a lot of their money.If you get sea sick try not to eat before because although the river itself is calm-ish, unfortunately the drivers of the boats tend to swing the boats around like a scene from fast and furious and smack the boats right into the pier sending shock waves through the boat passengers and the people about to board...Stick to your guns, know where you want to go, push for local prices and you'll have a fun boat ride!"

One could hire a private boat for an our long ride at a cost of about 200 baht. But now riders are channeled into an operation that packs as many folks onto one boat as possible.

The food they serve is below average, especially when u had a long day touring the city you would plan to have a pretty descent meal for dinner.Just for the sake of a river flowing through the city and the views it can offer i would recommend Chaophraya.But the cruise facilities needs to improve a lot in the food and hospitality."

The commuter ferry is not a hop-on hop-off deal, so if you get off somewhere you'll need to pay another 15 BHT if you get back on, but it is less than the visitor ferry (Blue flag) which is 140 BHT, but does allow hop-on, hop-off.Be ready to move when you see the ferry getting close; this is no-nonsense boarding - you are expected to get on and off quickly.There are also plenty of additional ferries and water taxies running smaller stretches and going from one side of the river to the other; and there are the longtail boats which run about 1000 BHT for a one hour trip along the river - more romantic perhaps than the ferry, but the view is the same."

We took two boat rides on the Chaophraya, one was a tour of the back channels on the west side of the river in small ferry, rides in the long boat are faster. Amazing to see the close adjacency of modern building, humble poverty and abandoned colonial estates. On another day we use the larger riverboat to ride form the end of the BST elevated train route to the doc at Golden Palace. Fast, cheap, comfortable and great sights including Wat Arun along the way."

The public ferry 15 bhats a trip is great to visit the royal palace and reclining Buddha up river. These ferrys can be very crowded, often standing room only. Be aware where you are getting off before boarding as if in rush hour and packed like a sardine orientation may be difficult.There are various tourist boats 150 bhats or so which we didn't do as they seem to cruise the same stretch that the public ferries do.Our favourite are the long tail boats. You can do trip up river for 150bhats and experience a speedboat thrill dodging congested traffic on the river. We hired a long tail boat just to ourselves for 1 hr for 1,100 bhats. We got taken down river at speed lots of spray and bouncing on other boats wakes and the through a lock system ( flood prevention) into the western canals. Fascinating to see the life on the canals with houses of various descriptions on either bank. A more lesiurely cruise through the canal system. Slight irritation is that the log tail stopped for a small boat laden with tourist tat trying to sell stuff to you. Just be firm. Mind you I did appreciate buying two cold beers for 150 bhat. Got the log tail to drop of us at the Palace pier rather than where we started. If you are not a stickler for \"health & safety\" a brilliant way to see Bangkok and get a thrill ride thrown in."

Not realizing there were other options, we booked a long boat tour for 2500 baht. It did seem a little steep but we hadn't planned to do a river tour today so we hadn't done any research and didn't know what was normal or fair. After the fact, we discovered there is an actual ferry that goes up and down the river stopping at fifteen different stations on the east side of the river. It only costs 30-150 baht and, as long as you aren't set on riding in a long boat, feeding fish, etc. it will allow you to see just as much as the tours. The river is what it is and, I feel, is definitely worth seeing. Just check your options and find what you really want before you pay."

We took a BTS train till Saphan Takshin and then got down and walked to the pier (5mins). Then we got a ticket to Phra Athit as that was closer to China Town and Khao San areas which we wanted to check out. The boats are basic with hard seating and can get crowded between 5-7 pm. The water ways have hotels and posh tall condos. It\u2019s a peaceful and relaxing way to spend time and is very economical to get to areas which are not covered by the BTS/MRT network. I guess we paid only around 20baht or so per person."

Catch a free boat to any of the main hotels for a coffee, the boats are marked which hotel they belong to, pick one the furtherest away from the pier. Maps are on the pier. Do a regular tourist run of an hour or so or even a half day with commentary etc. Options are limitless and depends on the time you have. The river was the main travel centre of action however with the building of bridges the river traffic is not as hectic as it used to be but still considerable and certainly worth some time there, even if only to sit on the pier for awhile and watch what goes on.

If you feel board or tired, find a suitable station in the middle (which has seats etc.) and wait there for another orange flag boat to bring you back.All in all, it was a fun travel, I could see the city, temples and people for a mere $1.

One of the best ways of sightseeing is from the water, and seeing Bangkok from its river is no exception.Possibly the easiest way to explore the Chao Phraya is by getting the excellent BTS/Skytrain to Saphan Taksin stop, and taking a Chao Phraya River Express boat from the nearby pier. This is a great way to get to the Grand Palace (get off at Tha Chang) and far quicker than sitting in Bangkok\u2019s treacly traffic. Fares are cheap, but you need to know when to get off if wishing to visit other attractions. The Express boats go at a fair clip, so be aware of swallowing any spray from the polluted river.While river cruises are touristy, they provide a brief overview of the bustling waterway. You will see history, from ancient teak rice barges and colonial buildings to modern skyscrapers. A klong (canal) cruise offers a glimpse of the rapidly disappearing klong-dwellers on the west (Thonburi) bank. It was the klongs that gave Bangkok the epithet \u2018The Venice of the East\u2019. A totally different experience is to take a dinner cruise. These can vary in quality, so choose carefully and in fine weather, ensure you get a top deck table as these offer the best views of this exotic city."

It is noisy and distracts from what you can see but does stop at all the main attractions along the river. The public ferry only takes you to certain docks and can be confusing without a local guide but a private tour in a long boat will stop wherever you want and is a bit quieter although more expensive. The sights along the river are wonderful and give a good insight into Bangkok and its opulence and its not so opulent.

After about an hour the boat continues upriver to Koh Kret.Koh Kret is an island that has a long history of pottery making. Wandering around the kilns and watching the production process is interesting and photogenic opportunities are there if you look for them. The island people seem very friendly and walking the small lanes will take you through a very Thai style area - complete with a very fine boar that followed us for most of the day like a pet dog. We got quite fond of him and gave him the name, \"Herbert.\" Check out the insane speed boats running locals about around the island.As an alternative to catching the ferry back we caught a taxi ride to Chatuchak Markets and from there a sky train ride back to Silom.Generally enjoyed by all and a good value days outing"

A taxi is comfortable but you do not smell the fresh air of the river. And you are not 'moving'. Like MOVING. On the river you have 3 kind of lines which differ in price and comfort. Take the first boat is my suggestion. The Orange Line for 15 Baht, a Green Line for 25 Baht and a YellowLine for 30 Baht. Especially Tha Chang stop ( pier N9 ) and surrounding piers ( pier 8 and 7 ) are special because of the things to do overthere.. But the whole double curve in the Chao Phraya river from pier N1 till pier N14 is great. We took several boats to nowhere. Got out just to see what happened overthere. Stayed for longer or short time. We had a superb meal at pier N9 for 1 dollar (!) in the evening at a stall in the open air. Chicken with garlic and rice. Ans fish with rice. Could not be better. You buy tickets at ticket offices at the piers. We had a hotel there which was great too.. The Royal Tha Tien village."

There are also annual festivals held along the river, such as the King's annual boat procession and the rehearsals for it. Also Loy Krathong on November 26th is a good time to visit the water's edge to watch the annual festival of atonement. Although the water's muddy and you'd never dream of swimming in it there is something very relaxing about taking a water taxi, rather than braving the road traffic. A great way to travel around the old city especially."

Another is the public river taxi for 10 baht which stops at many places on the river, then there is a narrated tour boat that allows you to get on and off at several attractions along the river. You can easily get to the Grand Palace, River City, The Reclining Buda, Several Temples, The floating market, The Barge Museum, and many other attractions by boat that will take you hours by tour bus. No need to spend a fortune on tours that spend a half of day at a worlds largest jewelry store when you can use public transportation to see these places.

We choose the upper deck which was crowded but not in a bad way. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. The menu had quite a variety of mostly Thai food, but it was really well prepared, tasted great and was served very hot. Service was exceptional, the waitress was attentive and even topped up your drink when it was getting low. The cruise was quite long and slow, which is perfect for sightseeing. We travelled downstream under 6 bridges as the travellers cheered as we went under each one. On the way back, they boat went much faster and we went below to a live band and dancing. The commentator only spoke Thai, but we had an interpretor who filled us in with the important stuff. Good value all in US$100 for 3, including booze."

I've been to Thailand 4 years ago with my friend and the experience of travelling on the river within a distance from Khaosan area was authentic, with monks, all local and not touristic at all. We stopped at a park then we can walked to Rambuttri, met the local doing exercise in the park and I was given a nice perfumed flower by an old lady. So this time I took the tour with the hope of giving my friends the same wonderful feeling I had 4 years ago about this river travel in BKK.But I was wrong. I was so crowded and we took the long tail boat. The price was first 2000 or 1000 for 1 person but it was not the price I knew before so I tried to make a bargain. The one at the pier immediately gave another table of price of 560B/ each and then we got 2000B for 4 people, but the driver did not speak English at all. And the feeling of driving is not relax and authentic as I had before. This is just a thing for tourist if you don't have other things to do or never seen the life along the river before in your life, It's not all beautiful and clean, if you might expect.In general we all feel waste of time and money to take this. But I would have to tell another story relate to this tour. We got a friendly taxi driver with nice English speaking skill the other day in Bangkok of our stay. We talked on the way about what to do, where to go, and my friend just tried to be friendly to him. Then piece by piece, he gave us the leaflet about the tour in Bangkok and recommend us to travel around Bangkok on the long tail boat, and this is a must for a perfect Bangkok experience. My friend, again tried to be nice by saying \" ok, we might try it later, but today we want to visit the Siam paragon\" without telling him we didn't enjoy the river tour as It might be unnecessary to tell him so. We took the taxi about 4km from the Paragon (the Google map told us so) but he took us further away to our destination as we took the conversation with him. As soon as I realized it shouldn't take that long for 4 km, and he was travelling with the wrong direction, we asked to leave immediately, he didn't allow us to do so, even we asked for 5 times more, he took another 2 km to the pier and drop us there with my friends full of anger. I guess he must have the commission money for each tourist he drops there. Of course we wouldn't do the tour again but be careful with the nice English talking taxi and nice suggestion.So took the flat boat (which the local use, is much better, if your idea is not visiting the whole riverside of the city) and take the stop as your choice. Don't go for the very long and feel greedy to know it all because however, you just have the view of the tourist, and go by the route they choose for you.Have good time travelling. Traveled in Aug 2013"

We purchased One Day River Passes for 150baht which means you have free access to hop off and on. Its a pleasurable way of getting around.We also rented a fast boat to take us on a tour of the canals. Do barter. This was a great experience and you see a different sort of Bangkok.

So far, Bangkok is not my favorite--I should say, however, that we were entertained by all the huge monitor lizards we saw along the banks of the river (on top of cement bridges, docks, etc.) sunning themselves, maybe 15 or 20 of these. I don't think many of the tourists saw these since they seemed focused on the houses and buildings around... at least we didn't see anyone on the other boats excitedly pointing at these lizards!

The river is the lifeline of Bangkok and is a commercial hub as well as a tourist attraction with may prominent attractions including the Grand Palace and the Temple of Dawn located along its banks.There are two good ways to see the river. The first is to hire a long tail boat and go on a private cruise. The boat will take you to the various attractions along the banks and allow you to visit them. The tour takes around half a day, is more personal and can be customized. The other is to take one of the many scheduled river cruises which run along the river. Some of these start from river city mall and take you along the river include lunch / dinner depending on the time and have some sort of entertainment on board. These do not stop at the attractions, last for about 2 hours and have a large crowd. Personally, I prefer the long tail boat cruise.Definitely worth a visit."

Be sure to ask about the specific drop off place. On one occasion our boat operator dropped us off at a private pier and the people there demanded 20 bhat to land. While that is not a large amount of money, our other transfers had included the landing charge in the total price. There are several nice restaurants that line the river and at night there are dinner cruises with a fabulous view of the temples and the Grand Palace lit up. Worth the trip."

Some Thai people make their living by selling big bags of bread, with which people feed the wrestling hordes of fish.I asked our guesthouse manager if there was a reason for this fish feeding phenomenon and he said it was simply because it is forbidden to catch fish near temples, so instead, the Thai people feed them. So the fish grow fat on the free food and the sight is a spectacle along the whole river wherever you see a riverside temple. The kids and I spent a happy hour there dodging the splashes of the fishes' tails as they leapt on the bread being thrown in. An easy outing and a fun tuk tuk ride home to top off the experience."

We left it to a bit late, but I'm glad we went.It's a really cheap way to see some of the sights, the amazing hotels, and palaces fro the water.It's a little bit confusing when you get to the ferry terminal. The Chao Praya Tourist Boat has two types of fare. If you get on and stay on board for the trip up and back on the river, about 40- 50 minutes, it costs about 40 baht. If you choose to get off at different locations and explore, you can buy a day pass for 150 baht.Our boat was quite crowded, but that wasn't an issue and we got a seat. It was lovely to see the city from the water. The only think I objected to was the commentary. The PA system was so bad, we couldn't tell whether the guide was speaking Thai or English, or some other language. It was just noisy babble and really irritating. However for the cheap price of this ferry ride, it's really good value. I think some hotels also have boat cruises, which would be an even nicer way to see the river."

Call it what you want, but you haven't been to BKK if you don't pay your honorary visit to the Chao Phraya so don't even think about missing it and head over to the Saphan Taksin BTS station and hop on a boat for a short trip anywhere. Having said that, don't do as I did the first time and go to the very first place and pay your ticket, do a little walking and asking before you decide with whom to go. As it turned out, the first time I got on a boat I paid like 10X more than I should have paid because I listened to the first vendor. She wanted me to buy a 300Baht 1-hour tour but I just wanted to go to Chinatown which happens to be about 3 stops away. Well, she gave me a \"special price\" for 150Bahts to take me in a fast boat to Chinatown. Oh well, I was there was but that was the extent of it. The better choice is to go to the line for the local boats, the ones with the big crowd waiting for them, hop in with the crowd (as long as it's going the right direction of where you want to go) and then pay inside according to where you tell the attendant where you want to be dropped off. To Chinatown, and everywhere nearby it would be a total of 15Bahts (about US$0.50) rather than the $5.00 that I paid.If you want to taste the Chaop Praya even cheaper, actually free, then walk to the Shangri-La Hotel or the Oriental and ask for the boat to the Peninsula Hotel across the river.

Visitors don't realise how extensive this water network is with the river and canals covering a major part of the city. Catching a taxi around town in peak times can be frustratingly slow, however there are never any traffic jams on the river. It is one of the easiest ways to travel quickly and inexpensively around Bangkok. So, don't be afraid, head down to one of the numerous piers and have yourself an adventure. The friendly people on the boats as well as the ticket sellers will always help you find the right boat and the right stop for your trip."

Yes, the water is quite dirty, however I didn't find it to be smelly at all.At Nonthanburi you can get off the boat and have a look around the markets. It is a very local market and there are plenty of stalls selling all types of goods from fresh food to clothes and everything in between.It was an enjoyable morning's activity and I strongly recommend it for a taste of local atmosphere."

We took a tour on a long boat that took in some Khlongs (canals) and then dropped us near the Grand Palace. Take a look at real life along one of the many khlongs that criss cross the city. Pick up a guide for the ferries , the different coloured flags signify the destinations and stops, at one of the many piers along the river and it beats the road traffic. Get the BTS skytrain to Saphan Taksin, jump off the train, go down the escalator to your right and a quick walk down to Sathorn Pier where you can catc any number of ferries. Or you can catch the free ferry to the grand Mandarin Oriental (the Raffles of Bangkok) These are the teak looking boats, the peir for them is to the very left of the main pier. Take in a grand lunch at the Mandarin and walk thru to the old part of this amazing colonial hotel, prices aren't too bad and one of the best meals you will get. A taste of 'how the rich people live', at the end of lunch jump on the free boat back to the pier and to the sky train, the hotel is only 5 minutes from the pier.We also took a tour to the old capital Ayutthaya and walked the ruins of this ancient city, then returned on a boat where we had lunch on board. A great day and nice trip back to Bangkok via the river taking in heaps of sights enroute, Highly recommended!"

My son and I loved the river ride."

What you'll see is the great contrast on the banks -- between large luxurious hotels and condominiums for the rich, and the filthy, dilapidated dwellings on stilts for the city's many down-trodden. On the river itself, this contrast plays out too. There are the luxury cruise restaurants for tourists and then there are the overcrowded commuter boats with standing-room only. One thing one might appreciate around the river is there is often a wind, giving a little relief to the city's chocking heat."

Bought the river cruise tourist boat (exit no. 2 at Saphan Taksin BTS station) for unlimited hop-on and off at the different piers (150 Baht adult, 80 Baht kids) which is really good enough to explore the various attractions along the river. Had my 2 young boys along so exploring wasn't really on the agenda, just to bring them on a leisure river cruise from Sathorn Pier and hop off at Chang Pier to visit the Grand Palace. Take the seats on the left from Sathorn Pier for nice photo opportunities of Temple of Dawn as well as to avoid the morning sun which makes sitting on the right a bit hot. Along the main road going into the Grand Palace you probably will bump into people wanting to sell you the idea of tuk tuk ride to one other attraction + brief stops at souvenir/sale stores. Since they only charge 40 Baht for the trip, and it was not compulsory to buy anything from those stops, went on one round trip (Big Buddha, Chin Factory, Sale outlet). It was our first tuk tuk ride in Bangkok and the boys enjoyed this more than anything else. Eventually picked up some souvenirs at the souvenir shop in Chin Factory (which isn't that expensive) as well as local foodstuffs from the sale outlet. Just avoid the expensive stuff at all cost! They won't force you to buy so there is no pressure to make any purchases."

Well the boats are coloured coded and I took the commuter express by mistake. For 150 baht I ended up doing 2 hours plus cruising. Great value for money and saw more of the river. Absolutely fascinating. I eventually decided to get off where the Army camp stop was at Kiak Kai and waited about 25 mins and picked up another express to get back to Central. It is extremely easy to access the location where the ferry commences. You take the Silom BTS line from Siam Central and get off at Saphan Taksin. Then walk down the stairs (sign telling you which direction) under a covered walkway and there you are at the ticket office. My only suggestion is to clearly ask which boat to catch for a 1 hour cruise. If you have time and happy to explore then you can basically get off at any location and wait 10 to 15 mins Monday to Friday and 20 to 30 mins Sat and Sun for a return boat. It is a great experience. You dont need to do as part of a tour it is something you can do for yourself..despite me not checking it is very easy trip to do. have fun on the river and dont forget to bring your camera and water bottle."

If you are standing near the back of the boat, you could still get a view of the river. If you are standing along the aisle, not only do you block some of the seated passengers in the middle section, most average to tall people won't see much except the water and nearby boats. I saw some boats that are smaller, slimmer and seat about 20. You definitely get a good view on both sides of the boat. They are faster too. "

Jump on one of the local water ferries, for only 15 baht you can travel from one end of Bangkok to the other via the river, or just as an alternative to using a taxi or Tuk Tuk. Always plenty to see on the river, and it's so much more fun traveling with the locals than on one of the tourist boats. However, if you also want to see life on the canals, you can always hire a long boat for an hour or 2."

Its simply amazing way to see Bangkok and all that it has to offer.Do not be too excited with the Baht150 pass, for you may never know when you want to take the tuk tuk or the train afterwards. Besides you can only see so much on a given day & that for me did not even add up to Baht150. I mostly did the river way, walked & hardly tuk tuk then head back to hotel using the nearest Train line.It was very relaxing should you have a seat or when standing, for the breeze & sights takes the stress of you.

Who would take a taxi to sight see riverside when you got this right ? And at night, even more beautiful. The waterway as with any poor River that is unfortunate enough to be surrounded by such a large population is a little polluted, but hey, so is the Thames. The river boats range frm expensive (luxury floating restaurants, to inexpensive fast and convenient tourist operators. My Tip, go with the Chao Phraya Tourist Boat company (big blue boats), when I went you can get an all day / night (not too late) pass for 150 baht ! Unbeatible Thai service. I came her 13 years ago and there were so many people living rough but happy literally on the River side & out above the River on make shift houses, but seem to have been moved on as they had vanished when I visited again in 2013. Where did they go ? I wonder. I hope they were looked after."

Many of the dwellings on the banks were obviously quite old. The trip was very interesting and I guess our only complaint would be that the lady boat driver and her young assistant could not speak any English, and were unable to explain to us about various sites of interest.

It costs very little and as the name already suggests, it is speedy.You will most likely stand between other tourists, locals, and the occasional monk. If you stand close to the sides, you will get wet, but in Bangkok's fantastic climate everything dries quickly (Germs? Who cares? Have a Singha and calm down).You will see an amazing array of traditional temples, modern and ancient residential building, mega-hotels, and river life from the small longtail boat to bigger ships. Fantastic - you will not often have so much fun & travel value for so little money."

When you go to Saphin Taksin Pier it is easy to get confused between the different ferries!If you want the cheapest you need to catch the public ferry, the Chao Phraya river boat with an orange flag, you purchase the tickets on board, and they will give you change if you need it, it costs 15 baht for the trip whatever the distance, at the pier is a ticket office for the tourist boat at 40 baht per trip or 150 baht for the day,hope this helps the confusion I experienced. if you plan a short trip then the public ferry is the cheapest alternative, if you plan lots of trips then consider the day pass, but remember it is v hot so you may find you have had enough after 1 or 2 stops and seeing the attractions."

It is a useful way of avoiding the street traffic and very pleasant way to get were you need to go. Take one boats described below as far as you can and then get off at the nearest stop to where you need to go. Then jump on of one of Taxis or tuk tuks.There are multiple river boat lines plying the waters. As well as freight & cargo boats, I noticed three main passenger lines. On is the tourist sightseeing boat (ticket about 140BHT from most piers), this allows ticket holders to jump off at any of sights explore and jump on next passing boat to next attraction. Second is (also) tourist line (known as the Blue Flag Chaophraya Tourist Boat (CTB)) this also stops of at most of the piers cost about 40 BHT. There is guide on board who will point out the sites over the speaker system, as you go by. 3rd is the regular commuter traffic Orange Flag, used mostly by local people, you pay on board - 15BHT. The conductor will come through rattling a coin box. Pay when they reach you.more info can be found at the boat website. English version here;http://www.chaophrayaexpressboat.com/en/home/"

We learned very quickly to avoid the tourist tuk,tuk, the private boat hires and the organised Tourist Ferry by the Chao Phraya River. These are all too expensive. You can catch the normal express Boat ferry's (orange flag is on the bow of the boat). This is used by the Thai commuters. For 15 bahts (2013 charge), you can travel one ferry stop or 30 of them if you want (the first stop is Central Pier, the 8th stop is the Palace and Wat Arun, the end of the service is at Nonthaburi where there is a very cheap market... clothes, goods, etc). The last ferry that will bring you back to Central Pier (by the Saphan Taksin stop on the BTS Skytrain), is at 4:30 pm from Nonthaburi.Going the whole length of the service is over 12 miles of sightseeing for 15 bahts (instead of the 200 baht you might pay to use the tourist service). While there is no commentary, if you pick up one of the tourists maps available at all visitor centres in Bangkok, the river is marked with all the stops and all the tourist attractions for you to follow. Each stop has a corresponding number on the shoreside to that on the map so you know when you are at a particular stop of interest, to get off the boat for a look around.If you only want to do one or two sight-seeng stops on the river during the day... you are still not going to spend more than 60 bahts. You generally don't have enough time to do much more than this so you are wasting 140 bahts on the tourist boat (hop on and off).The river is busy, with lots of barges and ferries - it is lovely on a sunny day and well worth considering for a cheap day out."

The thing I like about this service is, you can get on & off whenever you like, no need to rush through a stop because you're scared you'll miss the boat, it goes back & forth ALL day. Chinatown is worth a visit, you have to do a little bit of walking but, so worth it-get off the boat at N5 (Ratchawongse Pier).

Ibis has the coffee shop on the rivershore, so if you chose Ibis and don't get a river facing room, you still can enjoy the river view from the coffee shop. I planned my sight seeing through cruises along Chao Phraya. This plan has the following advantages :a. saving time and stress from the terrible Bangkok road traffic b. almost 70% cheaper than a land transport. There's a all day pass for the Chao Phraya Tourist Boat at 150 Bahts / head, with unlimited rides, hop-on and offs, which is extremely economical.

Best way to go to most of Bangkok's tourist attractions like Wat Arun, the Grand Palace, Chinatown, etc is thru this famous river via the water taxi. Very cheap mode of transportation. You can buy a One Day Pass for THB 150 if you plan to go to multiple places. You will be given a map and schedules of departures at each of the pier stations. Be at the lower end of the boat if your stop is next because they disembark pretty fast, less than a minute in some, so you might miss your stop and especially at night where stations are not well lighted. The river has become dirty because of human activity but not stinky. At night, it could be very romantic especially if your dining in one of the hotel restos along the river. Better yet try the river cruise. To start your river tour, go to Saphan Taksin BTS along the Silom line from there walk towards the river and buy your pass at the Central Pier(Saphan Taksin Pier)."

There are two different kinds of boats for transporting passengers. The one is the Tourist Express Boat (40baht), and the other is the local boat which stops at every pier (15baht). Both are good. Just get on the boat and pay for a ticket once you are on the boat, a lady will come around and collect your fare.I think China Town is Pier 5, where you can buy lots of cheap goodies, also in bulk if you wish, but be warned, a lot of the stuff is really poorly made.The Grand Palace is Pier 8 or 9. Avoid the Tuk Tuk drivers, who will swear to you on their mother's grave that the Palace is closed today and will offer to take you elsewhere (usually a tailor or a gem store). The Palace is always open (unless it's a particularly significant holiday).Pier 13 is Khao San Road, where all the backpackers and budget travellers hang out. Worth a visit for the cheap food, clothing market and atmosphere.A day pass, if you are going to do a full day travelling up and down the river sightseeing costs R150baht.This is Bangkok, a city of millions of people, so don't expect the river to be pristine and clear. There is a night market called Asiatique alongside the river. You can get a free boat to the night market and back (think the boat starts running at 6pm) from the Central Pier. Take the Sky Train to Saphan Taksin, get off at the station and walk down to the pier which is to your left as you exit the station. If you cannot find the pickup point ask one of the ticket sellers at the pier.There are also many river cruises at night which offer dinner and a beautiful view of Bangkok. There are also other boats that take you up and down the river for sightseeing. Just ask at the Pier or go to any travel agent for details (there are a couple at Saphan Taksin station)."

Since I stayed in the Khao San area during my stay last week, the best transportation was via the boats that travel along the Mae Nam Chao Phraya (Chao Phraya river). Tha Phra Athit was the closest in Khao San, and from there you can get to different ports, specified by a port number in the Bangkok map. Careful though that some of the ports are not accessible by some of the boat. The best boat to take (as a tourist) if you're on a budget is the orange one (with the orange flag), which costs 15 Baht on all ports. There are tourist boats that cost 100 baht, or buy an all-day ticket at 150Baht.Sight to see along the river: The Wat Arun temple (get off at Tha Tien and take the ferry that goes to the other side 3 Baht), The Wat Pho and Grand Palace is accessible via Tha Tien ferry.The Rama VIII suspension bridge, get off at Tha Thewet bridge since the Tha Rama 8 is unavailable (not sure if due to renovation or it is permanently closed). Tha Thewet is kinda far to the bridge compared to the Tha Rama 8, you have to walk to Thanon Samsen from the port and walk along the road and turn right when you reach the bridge. Make sure to go up and cross the other side of the bridge as this is the only side you can get a nice view, aside from the view when you're in the boat, of course. If you have time, wait until it gets dark as the view gets better when the bridge lights are on.Accessible via the river ports:the Wat temples (mentioned above)Asiatique at the Central portSa Tha Ni Saphan Taksin (Saphan Taksin Station of the BTS Silom line) is accessible at the Central portYaowarat is accessible at RachawongseKhao San is accessible at Phra Athit"

While I had reason to fear it greatly when filling sand bags to hold it back during the 2011 flooding, on every other occasion, this river has easily connected with my psyche. It will connect to anyone with a soul. It is wonderful on Loy Krathong, amazing when the Royal Barges come out, and breathtaking on the King's 60-year-reign celebration, but it is great on any day of the year. Just go to Phra Sumen Fort and look out on it, or take a water taxi (take the whole route for fun!) during the day, or a dinner cruise, or any one of the excellent tours of the river to see how greatly it still impacts Bangkok life. Climb up Wat Arun's central Prang and look up and dwon-river a while. A boat tour up-river to Ayutthaya is another way to do so, and on that trip you will find your National Geographic moments.

There were several choices of food from local to Japanese and Western food. Food was great. The crew checked our table from time to time to refill our drinks or to take unused plates. We were entertained by a local band. It wasn't that great but we still enjoyed it. The other guests were in fact enjoying it more, probably because they were just simply enjoying it. We were a bunch of critics :-P We had a chance to witness Bangkok at night far from the busy streets. It was worth our time...and money...check out www.riversidebangkok.com. It is highly recommended. We have seen the other cruise and we believe that this one is really good. What i like most about it is its open air deck."

Having been kept waiting at the harbour for nearly an hour we were heralded onto the boat and shown to our table. Buffet was announced open and there was an almighty rush as everyone queued up for food, that frankly was not worth the wait. Yes, there was plenty of it and lots of choice but none of it particularly good and the free for all nature of service sort of dampened the appetite. The high point was the band that were very good and did a great job of creating a party atmosphere. Aside from the good view of the golden palace at night not much else to see."

There are stops at an alligator farm and other tourist shows, and if you've never been they're okay. One of my more memorable last-day-in-Bangkok experiences occurred a few decades ago on a warm January evening gliding along the river in a Long-Tailed boat. The sun was setting, Wat Arun glowed in the distance, and the large bottle of Singha beer purchased a few moments earlier from a vendor in a canoe tasted better and better as it disappeared with the sunset.River taxis are another way to experience the river, and are a worthwhile and inexpensive way to travel point to point."

It still amazes me how many boats use this river and it often to the untrained eye seems to be sheer chaos but the Thai's really understand how to use this beautiful water way very efficiently.If you are unsure what to do or how to get around using the river these are my tips.There are 4 lines on the river, the cheapest being the orange flag boats. These are the ones to use. They will stop at all the major piers and at only 15 baht per person to go as far as you want per trip they are amazing value for money and being on the river is the coolest way to travel.Print off a river map before you go and some websites even have lists of the attractions at each pier. Checkout Bangkok.Com for a printable guide.Take a private long tail boat around this river. You can get a 2 hour trip which usually includes Taling Chan floating market for 750 per person and even less if you barter harder.It is an unforgettable experience as you will go along the canals off the main river and see the real Bangkok which possibly has not changed for centuries."

I go down the river everytime I am in Bangkok.You can get to the river by taking the Skytrain to Saphan Taksin. Here you can sail with the local commuting boats or the tourist boats. I have always preferred the commuting boats. They cost 14 baht per trip and you get the same experience of sailing on the river than with the tourist boats.

As a photographer it's all about the lighting, the action and the people. On the river all this changes all the time.I have seen Thais of all ages washing everything imaginable. From babies to windows ,motorcycles,cars carpets laundry and even a bathtub.The Thais are very photogenic and will strike a pose as you go by and if you wave they return your wave and smile big for you.Everybody bathes from young to ancient and even the odd Coconut lady will row out and sell you a cool coconut milk drink after she cuts the top off with a very large machette.The houses are fancy mansions to tin shacks and everything in between and you get to see all the different boats that were ever made from dugouts to sleek speedboats,You pas Temples and Wats and your driver will stop when you want so you can get a better picture or talk to someone interesting in another boat and you can alo go to the snake temple and handle the snakes.(or not) They always stop at the china Temple where the entire Temple is decorated with China plates and pieces. Here you climb narrow stairs on the exterior and they are steep and you can go very high for magnificent views. You also pass by many Giant Golden Budha. very impressive. It is amazing how many awesome photos or videos you get on this ride.Now here is the rush. The boat your on is long and slim and is called a long tail boat as the motor is on the boat and looks like a car or truck motor It is very large and powerful and the drive shaft comes straight out of the motor and goes back to the prop which is about 12feet back or more and it is balnce so the driver can raise and lower the engine by hand easily and also steer by swing the engine from one side to another. some times the drives controls the boat with a foot it is that well balanced Now to say these boats can go fast is an understatement. So you have to talk to the driver about his boat and how impressed you are with his boat and driving abilities and you love to go fast He can't go fast during the tour. So, wait until you have left the China Temple and reach a big wide part of the river and he is now itching to show off and you can tell him to open it up Now thats a rush."

The free guide book produced by the operator is really excellent and provides information on which attraction is located near which pier and includes directions to reach them on foot. A day ticket cost us 150Baht each and could be used on the tourist boat or any of the other express river boats. The starting point is Central Pier, which is just next to Saphan Taksin Skytrain station. Buy your ticket at the central pier from the permanent ticket office building and not from the guys outside selling river tours."

There is no need to take a tour, just hop on an orange flagged boat, grab a seat if you can and then pay the conductor the B15 fee, ( a flat rate) for how ever far you want to go, one stop or 10! You see all sides of Bangkok, the tall hotels, the busy piers, the spires of the temples and the activity of the boats plying up and down the river, its facinating. Central Pier connects you to the Skytrain and with that you never have to sit in traffic. Its a a great way to get around and see the sights at the same time."

It was such fun to see how gaily colorful some of them were, and there were large and small tourist boats, tug boats, express boats and boats that just travelled a certain distance; many of those could be distinguished by the color of the flag flying at the back of the boat.The other thing is that they are a very cheap mode of transportation, and the scenery along both banks of the river as you travel along are constantly changing and it gives you a good idea of how the local Thai people live, and also how modern the buildings are in certain areas. You can stop at numerous piers to see temples or markets, and get to Chachuchak Market or Chinatown by boat or to Nonthamburi where there is also a very good market and access to Koh Kred by taxi from there... Many sights can be seen by travelling on the river.I did a dinner cruise with Loy Nava on this river, and after dark, the temples and wats are all lit up and quite beautiful, especially if seen from the water!I would call the Chayo Phraya River the \"river of Thai life\" because that is definitely what you see, on the river and on land as you go by... The boats themselves are very pretty to see at night as they are all lit up with lights.The other good thing about them is that the Bangkok transit system (BTS) gets you to the piers where you can catch these boats, quite easily, and that is a cheap and easy way to get around Bangkok, especially as the vehicle traffic is so bad!I highly recommend taking a trip on one of the boats on the river, and even staying at a hotel by the river as they sometimes have their own little boats to ferry you here and there and the views at night from a riverside hotel would be lovely...."

And indeed so, with so many attraction and riverside hotels sprouting beside the river and with it's providence of jobs creation. ... calling it the River of Life would not be far fetched.The most convenient to commence your adventure on the Chao Phraya would be to take a skytrain to BTS - Central Pier / Saphan Taksin (S6) on the dark green line. Walk down the elevated stairway and a short 200 yards walk down Charoen Krung Road, pass the rolls of red songthaews (pick up trucks) and road side snack stalls brings you the jetty embarkation point. For value for money river cruise, I recommend the 150 baht one-fare all day ticket (0930hrs - 1600hrs)... From the Central Pier, you can hop on various jetties (like the Tha Tien jetty) to visit the Grand Palace... and enroute back, stop by Wat Arun (the Temple of Dawn)...Just follow the travel advisory printed on the ferry pass....and you will be rewarded with a day filled day..."

When the local Thais get on, that will most likely be your local boat. Do your research to know which stop to get off to see what sights along the river.

Many of the attractions of interest to visitors are located along its shores. The Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, Chinatown, flower market and more are all found along the river. Connecting all these attractions with land based public transport is a river ferry system which is frequent, relatively comfortable and inexpensive. Pick up a map at any River Taxi dock. Ferry boats are color coded by the flag they are flying at the front and rear of the boat. Blue flagged boats are designated for tourists and stop only at the tourist related docks. Orange flagged ferry boats stop at MOST of the docks up and down the river and grey flagged boats stop at ALL the docks. I would recommend using the orange flagged ferries to get to all the site along the shore. If you're a little more adventurous you might consider chartering a long-tail boat for a 2 hour journey into the narrower canals which spur off the main river. This will allow you to get up close to everyday Bangkok. The canal side neighbourhoods, smaller temples and people coming and going in their boats are an interesting sight. Long-tail boats can be chartered at most of the larger docks. I chartered one for 2,000 baht/per entire boat for two hours from the Central Pier (Saphan Taskin) and split this with two other passengers making my cost 700 baht with tip. One way or the other, a journey on the river is not to be missed!"

Yes you can take an orange flag boat up the Chao Phraya River for 15 baht but it is also only 40 baht one way on the blue flag tourist boat and if you embark at Saphorn pier and stay on till Phra Arthit Pier (about 30 minutes) you get a tour guide commentary about both sides of the river that is a great introduction to the city sights. You can pay 150 baht to hop on and off but we opted for the 40 baht ticket one way ticket. You can pay for either ticket once onboard the boat, without having to queue at the ticket booth. We stopped for a cooling watermelon drink at the restaurant at Pak Kret pier then jumped on a 15 baht orange flag boat for the return journey. Great way to get an initial reccy. Take the dark green Silom Line BTS to Saphan Taksin then take Exit 2 to Saphorn pier. It's also not far to walk from the BTS stop to the Lebua Hotel at State Tower for wonderful views from its bars and restaurants - Sky Bar, Sirocco, Breeze, 64th floor - and incredibly attentive service. The river boat is also an ideal way to avoid traffic jams by accessing the Grand Palace at Tha Tien pier."

Service times 9.30 -16.00. You may also use the Chao Praya Express boat using the same route until 19.30 with the same ticket. The ticket services 8 piers giving access to some of Bangkok's tourist attractions. You can also change boats and proceed further up the river to pier N30 on the same ticket just show the girl on board.Your journey starts from the Sathorn (Central) pier adjacent to BTS Saphan Taskin monorail Station. We got off and walked around china town Ratchawongse Pier N5 up and down the small alleyways with motor bikes loaded with boxes doing deliveries to all the stall-shop owners. Then back on board we set our sights on Tha Tien Pier N8 visiting the Museum of Siam a quick clean bathroom stop here & a visit to the Reclining Buddha...remember girls to take a sarong to cover up as polite dress is required no short sleeves or shorts allowed. A few more stops I will let you discover. A great relaxing way to see Bangkok but be warned the boats pull into the jetty and you need to be quick to get on and off. Make sure you wear good shoes as no waiting here for you but it all appears to work seamlessly."

If you can run to it, hire a long tail boat and let the driver take you along the river at speed and then - in a more leisurely way - off up the khlongs (canals) that remain one of the nhighlights of Bangkok. You can hire by the hour and negotiate hard on price. But be prepared for a few extras: once into the khlongs there will be passing boats offering souvenirs and food and its hard to escape them. But that's part of the experience.Alternatively take the cheap option of either the tourist or regular boats that ferry people endlessly up and down the river. You can hop on and off at various piers for the price of a single day ticket. Piers let you have easy access to most of the main tourist attractions and to lesser known parts of the city, such as the graet wholesale fruit, veg and flower market. That's a genuinely cheap option for getting round the city, but boats can be crowded.The great thing about the Chao Phraya is that it is relatively cool, particularly when Bangkok is at its most humid. It's also a working river, with much to see; you've forever passing heavily laden barges, towed by incongrously small tugs. It's easy to spend a few hours on and off the water, without breaking a sweat. Well, kind of."

BKK has such a fascination for farangs because of all the Oriental stuff that one can see from a boat, including the aforementioned wat and also, big tall modern buildings proclaiming Bangkok's place amongst the ranks of 'modern' capital cities. I expect that further upriver there may be jungles and furry animals and stuff like that, but I never got that far. What I did see, however, is fish!

We loved travelling up and down the chao praya riveron the water taxis that the locals used, we used the orange flag boats, only 15 bhat each way no matter how far you travel up or down the river. You squeeze on with the locals and it's a great experience. The river does look brown but then what city river doesn't. You wouldn't want to drink it but then that's common sense surely. The contradiction of old and new buildings on the side of the river is good to see. A great way to get about."

Do not go on tourist boat, go on the middle (orange) level boats. They were easy to figure out and we enjoyed a trip north and a trip south. You pay, get on, get off, do what you wish, then come back and start again. So you pay per segment. It was about 14 B if I recall, so 50 cents. We rode all the way to each end. North went a long way. Saw the people and some of the sights of Bangkok. Convenient way to go to some attractions. As you approach any tourist site in Bangkok, scammers try to interest u in their taxi/boat/tuk tuk and will tell you something is closed or point you in wrong direction. Pay attention and brush these people off."

As there was four of us, two couples, we decided to hire a boat for a couple of hours to explore the river and all the rivers and canals that interlink around it. This proved to be such an excellent decision. We paid 1500 Baht for a private engine-powered longboat and we powered down the Chao Phraya River. As we went off the main river a lady approached us in another boat and offered us beers and soft drinks to purchase. So we were taking in all the sights and sounds of our own magical private tour, at our own pace, sipping a cold beer relaxing in the sun. It was such a highlight and I'd really recommend it to anybody!During the boat ride we saw the Wat Arun, the Grand Palace and so many more sights. We boarded the boat at Sathorn Pier. Have a bit of a barter with the locals: last time I came to Bangkok I went on the public big boat and this smaller, more intimate experience was so much better and the boat really whipped up some pace too as we raced down the river! Was really interesting too to see the people who live by the rivers and canals and to have a brief insight into their lives. Make sure you leave a couple of hours in your holiday schedule to pencil this trip in as it was one of my favourite things to do."

Get off at a crowded dock and take the taxi back the way you came or just hire a taxi to take you back to your hotel or wherever. Your own private long tail boat will set you back about $85 for a 90 minute ride and it is not worth it. Many scammers will try to get you on one of these boats for a kickback. If you are offered a cheap tuk tuk ride to the river, don't take it. They will try to sell you the $85 ride on the long tail."

We took a BTS till Taskhin bridge and took the express boat from the pier right under the station. A 15 baht ride took us to Phra Athit pier (40 min ride), which is basically the entry to Khao San Road. The ride was fun and un touristy and gave us a glimpse of the uber posh bangkok with the 5 stars lining the river, to the real dilapidated dreary side of bangkok 30 min into the ride.

Well we went outside to an absolute shermozzle. People and boats everywhere. Nobody seemed to know what to do, the announcements (the few that they were) were indecipherable so if you choose to do a boat trip, keep your ears open.Our boat finally arrived but to get to it we had to go through another of the boats tied up at the pier. If you are disabled either in a wheelchair or use a walking stick I'd forget it. There are no ramps to the wharf. Just stairs. The food on our boat was below average. They cater for the western tourist so if you like western buffets then you'll have a lovely feed. If you think you will get something Thai, forget it. The cruise itself was nice but a bit disconcerting to have the commentary provided by the male singer in the band, so mid sentence in his song he'd suddenly say \"and on my right is the.....\" and then go straight back to his song again. If you have nothing better to do, then go for a cruise but I wouldn't rate it highly"

Instead, go behind the ticket booth and wait in the area where passengers are hanging around waiting to board the assortment of ferries that stop here. If you wait until one of the tourist boats (signified by a Blue Flag) has passed and the area has cleared you can stroll past the back of the ticket booth and find the public ferry map. The public ferries (there are a number of different ones - signified by the flag color - which stop at different places) are listed. If you know where you want to go just wait and hop on - typically a 20 - 30 minutes journey will be 15 ThB (pay on the boat). Ferry stops are numbered so its a simple task to decide when to get off. (recommended to arm yourself with a River guide beforehand - there are numerous on Google) The Orange flag boats run all day and leave every 20 minutes. They go upstream and downstream from Taksin for some distance and for a few ThB (for example, 20- 30 minutes to Tha Chan is 15ThB). You can chose to see BKK from the River - stay on the boat and see everything the river can offer or hop off near to your (tourist) destination. Definitely worth a trip - and try to do it both at night and in the day for great contrasts."

If you're planning to explore all the areas where the boats stops at, I would suggest that you buy an \"all in\" ticket, which will be cheaper than the tickets bought on a \"per pier\" basis. The \"all in\" ticket will entitle you to a return trip will cost around 150 bahts.However, the ticket does not cover the trip across the river to Wat Arun, which ticket will cost you only 3 bahts."

It can be a challenge to get around Bangkok from the Khao San road to other parts of Bangkok without taking a taxi or tuk tuk. Both of those options are pretty pricy compared to the 15-40B ferries that can take you anywhere up and down the river. Its a nice relaxing (but not super fast) way to get around. Heads Up: the ferries get pretty crowded with both tourists and school kids from the early afternoon through evening."

The river is an amazing working river so you see all sorts of transport going up or down it. The Chao Phraya express is a great and cheap way to travel and you can get off and explore from many stations. We hired a long tail boat from our hotel pier for two hours and it took us around the canals to the west of the river where all the locals live. Its a real eye opener and if you are interested in photography like me, there are some great 'street scenes' to be shot. Also I thoroughly recommend Pak Khlong market which is near Raginee boat station. This is a working market for fruit, veg and flowers and really gives you an insight into Thai culture. There are not to many westerners there and despite appearances its very safe."

The floating market wasnt very big but you could certainly get a delicious meal. It seems that there is no shortage of fish. You can buy bread and feed it to the fish. The fish appear starving and really fight with each other to get the bread.  We took the boat at Taksin Pier for 2 hours. It cost bht 2400.

They will try to sell you a Day Ticket for 150 Baht when the individual trip on this boat is 20 Baht and the Express Boat is only 15 Baht for as far as you want! It's your choice but you may not use 150 Baht worth of 20 Baht trips. You should watch your change if you don't tender the exact fare.It is worth going to the end of the Express Boat journey. It's just 15 Baht and takes an hour. There is a market at the terminus which has a lot of fruit and other stalls. as far as the River review is concerned, it is difficult to know what to leave out but many features can be explored on Trip Advisor under their own category, such as the Grand Palace and Wat Arun."

Ride it all the way to Nonthaburi get off and stop for a snack at any of the little bakeries or food vendors along the main street past the clock tower. Then jump back on for a scenic return trip. Round trip for less than a buck...one of the best bargains anywhere. Just avoid the rush hours for obvious reasons. Respect the fact that this is a system that locals use to get places and not set up to transport tourists. These boats can become very crowded. Observe the proper protocol when Monks are aboard. Thai people are estremely accommodating and welcoming...it would be a shame to ruin their sense of hospitality and generosity by abusing this public transit system."

The variety of the food offered was reasonable not great!!View along the river is something worth mention as you see several Bangkok landmark and the boat cruises along the river.A live band played music and some of the crew was also dancing however, I felt that the music was too loud for a dinner.

And be aware of the touts or whatever they are called near the pier because when I was in Tha Tien pier, my friends and I were heading to Wat Arun. One of their guy told me that the boat fare is 200 bahts/pax. As I know it is much less than that. So when I declined their offer, they told me we can't enter to the pontoon. But you better ignore them. Just go straight inside and head to the correct pontoon. There will be an old lady sitting at the counter where you should pay the fare. And fyi, crossing over to Wat Arun only cost 3 bahts per pax per trip.You should try this transportation when you are in Bangkok. It is a good and interesting experience. Remember to look out for your friends. Don't leave any of them behind when you get on board. It is very crowded. Make sure all of you are together when the boat arrives.Have fun folks!"

Ignore the scam artists who tell you the \"temples are closed\" with offers to take you to the open and better spots. It's a taxi scam."

Each of these has its own charm, a special tourist trip at weekends takes you a much longer way upriver, stopping at some temples and finally at the island of Koh Kreet. Private boats go through some of the older canals in Thonburi at quite high rates, but you won't see any floating markets here. If you want to see Bangkok from a canal I suggest the Klong Saen Sep Canal which provides public boats at minimal prices. Another option is the free hotek boat from Sampan Taksin to Antara resort or viceversa, very romatic at nighttime."

DON'T go with people that grab you on the street the minute you arrive near the canal and offer you a boat ride, they are scams and charge you way too much and take advantage of tourists, also sometimes they stop at their \"friend's watch shop\" and such even without asking you first, you're just entering a trap. Go to the tickets office or book long tail boat from your hotel.We also took an early dinner cruise which was lovely, we went before the sunset, the view was amazing and the food was unique and good.

The 90min-2hr tours give a really good view of Bangkok life around the many canals of what was \"Venice of the East\". Be prepared to negotiate the cost, based on how many passengers - the initial amount requested will be an ambit claim. Take a bottle of water, and have some baht to use to barter with the lady who will row out to your boat to sell you souvenirs along the way. A canal trip is a very different insight into how many people still live - very humbly, above the water."

The ferry boats are cheap and very regular and take passengers to both sides of the river. Not clean or elegant and probably need much upgrading but a wonderful way to mix with the locals. Took this river boat to go to the Grand Palace and the Emerald Buddha....the Flower Market..also to China Town.. Foodis available in plenty at every stop, its where the locals eat and definitely worth a try.."

There's plenty of cheap and frequent river buses and river ferries so there is absolutely no need to be ripped off paying for a cruise unless you want to go all the way up river and go to Ayudthaya.You can get the buses and ferries from near the Oriental hotel but there are plenty of other places.Best thing to do though is to find one of the many restaurants that overlook the River. Sit watching the River traffic whilst having a good meal, a beer, reading the paper, or whatever.whilst your wife is busy spending up big on the fashions!There are plenty of good restaurants overlooking the river close to Banglampoo."

You are then able to go along the many canals that branch out from the River. This is where you will see the real people of Bangkok. See the conditions or lack of them they live in. The people here fish, wash and use the water to cook. It is amazing at the number of people who wave and say hello. They always have a smile on their face for you as you go past. Even though the water is dirty and does smell in some places I would certainly recommend you spend a couple of hours cruising the River.  Important thing to know is that the Ferries cannot take you up the canals. Only the longboats can do that."

Was thinking how to get the best outta remaining half day! Chatting with the tour desk at my hotel, found out a tailor-made half day Chao Praya river cruise called Rice Barge Cruise - reasonable priced, included hotel pick-up and drop off in air-conditioned vehicle and complimentary tropical fruits and drinks treat. Was picked up at 1:00 pm and reached river city by 2. The cruise starts at 2:30pm at river city pier and lasts for about 2 hours. The trip started in a traditional boat converted in to an express boat which went up stream the river and offered wonderful view of wonderful temples and other historical structures on both banks of the river. Just after crossing the Memorial bridge on the left side, first temple was the 'Temple of Good Relationship' (sorry, forgot the Thai name for this temple); then was the Majestic Wat Arun; almost opposite was the most famous of Bangkok attractions, Grand Palace & Wat Phra Kew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha). In my earlier trips, I have visited both these historical sites; but seeing it from the vibrant river leaves an unique impression in the mind! The cruise continues crossing the Phrapinklao bridge and Rama 8 bridge, then it takes a left small river/canal towards Nontaburi offering view of life on the waterways. The express boat then makes a return and moves towards a 'Traditional Rice Barge' conveniently converted in to a tourist boat. Second part of this cruise continues in this wonderful Rice Barge. Guests are treated with traditional tropical fruits and drinks. The barge returns to the Chao Praya river, crosses the river city goes further down-stream offering view of this vibrant river and landmark structures on both banks of the river. It travels close to the Sathorn bridge and the BTS (Sky train) river crossing then makes a turnaround towards the River City where we got on board. A wonderful river cruise of a different kind - for me a memorable utilization of an supposedly idle half-day :)"

One easy route is to take the Skytrain (Silom line) to Saphan Thaksin station, walk to the riverfront and board either the regular or tourist boat heading toward Nonthaburi.The regular boat makes more stops, is less expensive and much more crowded. The tourist boat hits the major stops - the best known wats (temples) and Chinatown - costs about 40TB and even has a tour giude announcing the various sights."

The public ferry up the river from Central under the bridge at \"saphan taksin\" sky train stop is really cheap only about $1.40 for 5 stops or 45 stops so if your like us and just want a bit of a look around don't forget to get off and catch one going back or you will be on the ferry for about 3 hours if you go to the end and back. It takes you to a few of the most popular tourist temples but not much else to see."

Easiest is to board a ferry at Saphan Taksin which you reach via the Skytrain (dark green line). You can choose between the local version on the left, cheap but crowded or the tourist version on the right which is slightly more expensive has more sitting room. You can just go to the end and back or make stops near the Royal Palace or Wat Arun temple. Using it is very simple and the desk selling tickets will tell you where to get off. Cruising the river is a treat with the bustling traffic of all kinds of boats. It is a must do."

To get my two young daughters to keep their hands inside the boat I told them there were crocodiles in the river. They weren't quite sure whether to believe me or not but they kept their hands in the boat just in case.This year, older and wiser, they asked again whether there were crocodiles and I just gave them a knowing look although they claimed not to believe me. You can imagine their surprise when they spotted a huge monitor lizard sunning itself on a bridge pillar in the middle of one of the inlets to the Chao Phraya River, they immediately sat on their hands!!! They now have renewed belief in Father Christmas and the Easter Bunny!!I would thorougly recommend a long tail boat trip on the river, feeding the cat fish was amazing - we bought a loaf of bread from someone on the bank, lowered to us in a fishing net. The river just came alive with heaving cat fish desperate for the bread. It's also so much easier to visit temples and other tourist destinations rather than sitting in a cab in a traffic jam for ages."

I have used the river boats to visit the Emerald Buddha, the Royal Grand Palace, the flower market and Sampeng Lane (Soi Wanit) market in Chinatown. You can get to all these places by taxi, but I recommend the river. You get to see Bangkok from a different perspective and it is quite convenient and cheap!"

You'll be amazed how she remembers who has already paid.On our way back from the Grand Palace, we took the Orange Flag boat to N5 Ratchawong to visit Bangkok's Chinatown. After Chinatown, we took another boat to head back to Central Pier so we can catch the BTS Skytrain back to where we started.If you want to check out Pak Khlong Flower market, get off at N6 Memorial Bridge Pier.

The trip to the wharf was a one & a half hour nightmare taxi ride in horrendous traffic, only to stand on the wharf with hundreds of other tourists waiting to board the boats. When we finally got aboard and were sat at our table, the boat left the wharf quickly and we were under way. The MC announced that the buffet dinner was now open so most of the passengers rushed up to get their dinner. We sat to let the masses thin out a bit, ordered a bottle of white wine and enjoyed the very talented female singer perform some truly entertaining numbers backed by a very complimentary band. It seems we were the only Aussies on board as we were surrounded by groups from many different ethnic backgrounds. No problems, we were here to experience the world. Turns out we were also the only ones drinking alcohol, water in front of everyone as far as the eye could see. Oh well, each to their own. We finally ate and while the food was ok, it was nothing to rave about. Then we took our wine and sat outside by the railing and watched the Bangkok skyline float by. This was great. Eventually the singer also moved outside where there was a bit of deck space. She started doing traditional songs to suit the nationality of the passengers. They followed her out and began joining in with the singing and dancing, this was very enjoyable to watch. We noted that in many cases it was the men who got up to dance rather than the women. This was an eye opener. In Australia it would be all the women with only the gay guy & the drunk bloke daring to perform in front of strangers. So all in all it was a fun night and we're glad we took the time to do it."

In season the different fruits are worth trying - durian, mangosteen, salac, rambutans, lychees and longans (my favourite).The people at the market are friendly and will engage with tourists who are interested in asking about their produce.

We love flowers and spent the majority of our time there, and it was well worth the trip. The smaller boat allows you to go into areas off the Chao Phraya River that the larger boats are unable to navigate, thus giving you and up close and more personal look at life on the river. It was an interesting opportunity, with a good slice of the variety of people living and working; and the variety of homes, etc. on the river. The photo opps were great!! We only cruised through the floating market and past the Royal Barge Museum since we stayed so long at the orchid farm. All in all the trip is great, our guide could not speak English, but in our view this was purely a visual journey, and so that was just fine. Absolutely fabulous and definitely a repeater for us."

The views from the river are fantastic and are great for photography, especially at night when everything is lit up, e.g. the Temple of the Dawn and Grand Palace. But the highlight is the insight into the day to day living along the river, with houses built almost on the river and people going about their daily lives. The river fire station with fire engine boats was interesting \u2013 not something you see often.There are a lot of boats and other watercraft on the river from small long tail boats to enormous barges to large diner cruise boats.The river is relatively clean for such a large river used as a main thoroughfare through the city \u2013 we saw relatively little garbage floating and did see a lot of fish in the river.The Chao Phraya River is at the heart of Bangkok and no visit to Bangkok would be complete without spending some time on the river and it\u2019s a great relaxing way to get around."

Once we boarded our boat, we were directed to our table in the front of the deck of the boat very close to the band and kareoke singer which was awsome. We cruised on the river for 2 hrs and a tour guide referred us to the different temples and the Royal palace. Listening to the mellow tunes of the band while have our buffet meal was great. Food was really define and was a variety of dishes from starters,mains to dessert and coffee.

Whether you travel the Chao Phraya everyday to commute, or are a first-time visitor to Bangkok, there's always something unexpected, pleasureable and/or fascinating to see on the river. The best and cheapest way to see Bangkok and river life is riding one of the many public river taxis. For one of the most enjoyable ways to experience the Chao Phraya, hop on any of the public express boats and head as far up or down the river as you care to go, then jump off and catch the return trip back, perhaps after enjoying a lunch or dinner at a river-side restaurant or food stall (virtually every boat landing has a good selection of local restaurants and dining/drinking choices, usually at a fraction of the cost of restaurants near the tourist centers)."

There you can bargain for a fast boat which will speed you around the main river and side waters. If you take this option you need to be pretty quick at taking photos.

We had an idea of the direction we wanted, so it was a matter of looking at the map, seeing the color of the line we wanted to catch, and then waiting for the boat to come baring the color flag we were looking for. Once we figured that out, it was really enjoyable. For the older crowd, getting on and off is a quick process, with a moving boat, so be careful.

It is much preferable to sitting in a hot taxi in traffic on the ground, but there are some tricky parts. There are no set fees, so when the guard at the dock quotes you a price, he's probably taking a cut, because you might go a block/dock down and get a taxi for 1/2 the price. And if a taxi is waiting at the dock (for example, at a wat), no other taxi will come near and offer you a better fare. There are \"tour boats\" that you can ride for much, much less, and the local boat/bus is even cheaper but very crowded and you will have to wait for it, and then stand.

He will gladly take your money, about 1000 baht for 5 people and send you aboard the longtail. The trip includes a 2-3 hour meander through the long canal and eventually returns to the Chao Phraya River. A stop along the way seems usual however as our boat driver didn't speak English I couldn't say where we actually stopped. The second option for enjoying the river sights is the commuter ferries. Get your ticket and jump on quick for a ride down or up the river. The ferries are usually packed with locals. Just watch out for the ferry captain who nods off to sleep as he crosses the river.

Avoid tourist boat which is 150 baht for much the same journeys.We also did a sunset river dinner cruise which was just amazing. Wat Arun looks wonderful lit up at night. The river looks amazing in the dark. I would highly recommend a dinner cruise especially for a special occasion."

Taking in all the scents and sights.  Take a sky train to the Taksin bridge ( not if you are staying in one of the many five star hotels there) and hire one of those long tail boats ( about 800 baht for an hour trip, depends on how skilled you are at negotiating), note that there're two kinds of boats you could hire, the loud and fast long tail ones or slower and quieter ones, I assumed. Personally I liked the quiet one since you still can comunicate.  Along the boat ride they will stop for you to either get off for snake show ( with small fee of course), souvenir shops or what have you. Don't get mad, it's part of the bkk charm i guess, simply smile and decline. You could be mad and rude to them assuming you are a good swimmer, I kidded obviously.  Alternatively you could board passenger boats with very tiny fare, and just mingle with the locals. Cheap and very effective way to learn and see something new."

Great for getting between Khao San and Wat Po, as just one example."

Unfortunately, it started to rain after half an hour, but the staff was brilliant in moving everyone down under cover, and when it stopped raining we ventured upstairs where they resumed music and the staff had us all up dancing and clapping. Black Label added to our glory. We danced to the tune too. The singer was very lively and played hindi/panjabi songs. On both sides of the Chao Phraya River, a tourist can see many magnificent temples and architectural buildings including the First Presbyterian Church, the Royal Thai Navy Dockyard, the Thai Maritime Navigation Company, the Old Customs House, Wat Prayunwong, Wat Arun, the Grand Palace, Wat Rakhang Kositaram, and the Royal Boat House.

You will see both building s of every shape and size from magnificent temples, older style houses, modern skyscrapers, tiny shantys almost falling in to the river, and everything in between and for very little money. You can take the tourist ferry for a few dollars more with a commentary if you like or you could even jump on a Long tail boat for a quicker but slightly more expensive tour. either way, you are going to enjoy the experience."

They just give us free refill mineral water and one glass of juice, if you want another drinks you can buy from the menu list.If you prefer elegant dinner, choose below deck, which is a room with glass wall so you can still enjoy night view of Chao Phraya, they give us live music mostly romantic-love song and air-conditioned room.Upper deck which is open air more lively, you can dance and sing together with the singer, they sings up-beat music here.The cruise takes us to see Wat Arun at night with the light around it. You also can see 'shining' Grand Palace from here..Okay,that's enough.. if you want to know more, just try it! ^.-Ohya.. There is a girl wearing Thai traditional clothes who will ask you to take a picture with them. They will sell the photo result inside the cruise.. You dont have to buy it.."

You can see more history on the banks of the river--and see it cheaper--than any other way. Take the Chaophraya Express boat with the crowds of Thai commuters, and get off wherever things look interesting: the old St. Theresa church at Kuti Jeen, where there have been Thai-Portuguese families living since the capital was in Ayutthaya; the atmospheric Old Customs House; the Temple of the Dawn; Rajawongse pier; or go right to the end of the line in Nonthaburi, and then cross the river for a delicious Thai meal in the open air at Taksura restaurant. A lot of the most interesting places require a few minutes' walk, and all of them are more fun to see if you've read up a bit on Thai history. But if you just sit on the boat watching the sights slide past, you'll have a wonderful time, too. For about B17 the whole trip, if memory serves; an absolutely unbeatable value."

I have been on this boat over 50 times and still not tired of the sights, sounds etc. I have taken over twenty people on this \"tour\" and 100% enjoyed the ride. When you get to Nonthaburi there is a local market that is... \"local\" very Thai. Very enjoyable boat ride!!! Commute time is very crowded which is fun as well. The monks stand along the side of the boat and most boats have a sign designating this area. If no monks, you are welcome to stand here. If monks get on board, be respective and give them the space.

There is a brief commentary about what is at various points along the river and which stops you would need to access them.A cheaper way of getting around is the water bus which was 15 Thai bhats per journey. All the boats are identified by different colour flags and these correspond mostly to the different piers/stops where you can hop on and off. It's a bit confusing to begin with but you soon get the hang of it and it is a wonderful way to mix with the locals and see a different way of life."

It is and certainly will affect your trip, so If you want to skip the hustle and bustle of the local traffic. Do check out the Chao Phraya River. You can go here by riding the BTS. The BTS has several stations located at the main section/s of the city, depending on where you stay. You will ride the BTS and alight Saphan Taksin. The destination of the route is Wong Wian Yai but you alight 2 stations before hand for Saphan Taksin. As you exit the station, you have to take the exit where it says River Boat. Upon exiting that, you go down and find the port. The port offers 4 different companies that offer river tours.Just buy a single ticket journey ( around 40 Baht ) and you can ride the boat the will take you to various ports all through out the city by means of the river. The boat stops at various locations to pick up and drop off passengers to their destinations. You can now visit various temples as well as palaces, the Chinese market and various landmarks just by taking the boat ride.The route of the boat ends at the last stop and then returns to the places where it dropped off and picked up passengers. Duration of the boat ride is 30 mins but you have to wait every 30 mins before you see a boat, if you want to be picked up at the drop off point.Very convenient way to explore Bangkok, notice that this is only a river boat cruise of the city. If you are planning on visiting the floating market, that is another story. Because that is 1 1/2 hours away from the city and would require an actual tour unless you plan to taking taxi."

I normally take the sky train to Taksin Bridge, jump on the regular ferry and watch the river sites go by all the way to Nonthaburi. Here there is an interesting local market to wander round and places to snack and have a coffee. I then take the ferry back, usually stopping off for a meal and to people watch at the back-packer mecca of Kao San Road. Often I stay here until later and go to the marvellous Blues Bar which is not far from Kao San Road. The other main ferry stop of interest is near the Grand Palace but many stops lead to interesting places to wander round. Note that the ferries stop at about 7.00 PM and so you will need to take a taxi to get back 'home' after that time."

It was so interesting to see how people have built their homes over the river and how they live. The locals were friendly, always waving from their porches. We even saw a few monks! We were able to buy some bread to feed to the fish that were swarming at one portion of the river...I think our captain mentioned a fish farm, not sure. Then another boat came up to ours and offered to sell us cold beer and little trinkets. We bought some beer for the boat captain and some Cokes for us, it was a nice way to support a local entrepreneur. I would bring your camera and have fun!"

The river water is quite murky and the piers are not upto standard in terms of facilities such as public toilets or sufficient seating area in case of rains.Tips: 1. You can do a budget ride for baht 100, take the metro to Saphan Taksin, slope down to the ferry stop and take a ride to Tha Tien Pier from where you can cover Wat Arun and Grand Palace.2. Protect your camera lens from splashing water in case you use the narrow speed boats."

They only cost 15Baht each time you get on (in the event you want to get off at some of the piers and then return to the boats again). They run very regularly and stop at most of the piers up river. It's great for a leisurely way to see the sights along the river and to take great photos. Just look up the orange ferry routes on the Internet and jump on and off when you need to. To get to the Orange boats, just take the Skytrain to Saphan Taksin and you'll see the central pier as you exit the Skytrain (just make sure you head toward the river and not in the other direction! It's only a 1-2 minute walk). When you get to the river pier, the Orange boats leave from the pier to the left of the main peer where the tourist boats are.It's easy to reach Wat Pho and Wat Arun, the Grand Palace, Chinatown, etc. from the piers along the river. Try going all the way the end of the line to Nonthaburi - it becomes more rural and you can see a bit more of Thai life.Perhaps even make the return journey from Nonthaburi between 5 and 6pm and sit to the right of the boat. You can get some great photos of the sun setting to the west bank of the river."

We took a private long tail boat ride along the Chao Phraya River and through the network of canals and would highly recommend doing this trip or something similar (we booked through viator).It was such a calming, serene way to spend our first morning in bangkok and really quite romantic! We loved cruising past rice barges and other boats and down the winding canals to see some of the lesser known areas of Bangkok while checking out some the thai temples, buildings and houses along the way. Wonderful."

            "review": "The river itself is gross, and the dinner cruises....so-so.. I think that the only reason to go down to the river is to take a dinner cruise. For most tourists, who will not know where to go to book, you should make reservations though your hotel concierge. You may end up paying a bit more, but this is one of those signature Bangkok activities that you have to do in order to say that you \"did Bangkok.\" If you do not have a hotel concierge, go to one of the big hotels on the river, and book through them. Yes, it will be expensive, but it will also be legit, and you will not get ripped off.Be forewarned that once the dinner cruise is over, however, you will realize that it was not that big of a deal. I recommend getting Thai food. It will be better than any other cuisine. I advise sitting outside, on the top deck. You will want the breeze. If you are below, in air conditioning, you will be subjected to unpleasant kitchen smells and the music, I guarantee it, will be too loud. I do not understand why the Thai love to assault your eardrums with loud music, but they do. The room will be too crowded. The bathrooms are horrid. You may not be able to continue to eat if you have to use them. They stink, and they are basically holes that drop down directly into the river. So much for concepts of river ecology. You will see some \"enchanting\" Wats and other cultural attractions appropriately lit up for your enjoyment as you pass by. You will pass beneath a bridge that spans the river, and you will be very close to it, which will be exciting for a moment. That is pretty much all that happens on a dinner cruise. The music, every time that I went, was execrable. Too loud, and plain not good. For a river cruise on the Chao Phraya to be enjoyable, in my opinion, you need to like the people with whom you dine. If you have good dinner company, you will not care about the somewhat cheesy quality of the excursion. Indeed, it can furnish much fodder for conversation. Do not mock it too loudly within earshot of any Thai people. They are extremely nationalistic and proud of their country, and they can get irrational if you point out shortcomings in a way that they interpret as an assault on themselves or on their society. Never forget that they have a concept of \"face\" that most Westerners will not understand. In fact, I advise that you google and research the concept before visiting Thailand. It will help you avoid brutal faux pas. Now that I think about it in retrospect, the coolest part of the two dinner cruises that my wife and I have been on was sitting for the couple's photograph. They laminate the photo onto a plate, which you can then hang on your wall. It makes a nice memento. Especially as we get older. I would absolutely avoid the river during daylight. It is an impenetrable disgusting brown, it looks like slowly moving mud water, and you will shudder when you see children jumping and frolicking in it. I do not even want to think about the liver flukes that certainly afflict them. The river often smells. Almost always. It is not picturesque, unless you are deluded. If you are going to a floating market or taking a water taxi, so be it, but my advice is to avoid the river during the day. Further, stay away from the tourist markets. They are overpriced, and you come into contact with the worst people in Thailand, which are those who make a living cheating and overcharging tourists. Do not waste your time or your money. If you want to shop, go to the Chatuchak Weekend Market, and learn how to dicker before you go. Do not waste time going anywhere else. Or, talk to a local Thai who can guide you to markets used by the denizens and who can help you negotiate prices. Too many Thai think that they are entitled to quote a \"farang price.\" I never accept this. I do not mind paying very well for exceptional service. In other words, I reward excellence. I never reward larceny. Nor should you. Never forget that if you encounter a larcenous Thai, that you can and you should simply walk away. Do not say a word. Keep your face expressionless. Just look the thief in the face, blink two or three times, perhaps permit a shadow of pity to come into your eyes, and then walk away. They will not care. Other tourists are right behind you. Stupid tourists. Tourists who will pay absurd prices that are jacked up far beyond the norm. I understand that there is great poverty in Thailand. I would like to gently point out that the people who are ripping you off at various market venues are not among them. They are not poor. They do very well. If you go to real markets, real street markets, in real neighborhoods, or if you go to the Chatuchak Market, you will see that there is no need to subsidize rip-off artists. Those people will quote you un-inflated prices, and they will negotiate in good faith. It is better to purchase goods and services from honest people in Thailand. If you go to the right places, you will find that you are surrounded by them, and they will disarm you with their innate goodness and with their generosity. They are beautiful. If you stick to the tourist areas, you will be systematically abused. The choice is yours!Hope that this helps. Enjoy."

Not much of a scenic river cruise if that's what you are wondering, but \"interesting\" and definitely an option mode of transport instead of road which is trying - took us 4 hours to get 20-25km from Watpo to Sukhumvit by taxi!!! 3.30pm from Wat Po and 7.30pm to Sukhumvit.

Stepping on and off the boats at the various piers gives you easy access to Bangkok communities that are less modernized and sanitized. You can find busy quaint markets, small temples, etc. in these neighborhoods without being hemmed in by huge crowds of tourists. Riding the water buses is an experience in itself, and much less difficult than doing the same in the Khlong Saen Saeb water taxi - I would take children to ride these boats. You can easily access the water bus network from the pier at Saphan Taksin BTS station.The night time dinner cruises along Chao Praya are also worth trying.

My favorite part was the way the ferries wouldn't really come to a stop and instead smack against the dock....hold on tight! They don't wait either..have like a 10 second stop and they're off again. I had traveled the Hong Kong Star Ferry just 2 weeks prior to visiting Bangkok.

It's very cheap (less than $1 USD) and is more of an \"experience\" than standing in a train car, but maybe a little less of an experience than taking a Tuk Tuk. There are several stops at major sights (Wat Arun, Wat Po, Grand Palace and more). A must do if you are near the river. The main pier is next to the Taksin BTS station."

The Chao Phraya River might not be the cleanest in the world but what it does offer is an alternative form of transport in a city that is notorious for traffic on its over crowded roads and does so with some of the best views and attractions that Bangkok has to offer..! You have 3 choices of boats on the river... The \"tourist boats\" which cost 150 Baht for a 1 day ticket with unlimited stops... And, you have the traditional \"Thai longtail boats\" and with these the price will vary depending on how many are in your group and where or how long you want the boat for and your bargaining skills... Then there are the express/commuter boats (with yellow, orange or green flags on front) which are extremely cheap and cost only 10 to 30 Baht for the longest trip available... With that being said, many of the cities tourist attractions can be accessed by the river... Some of them include, The Grand Palace and Wat Pho (Temple of the Reclining Buddha)... Both of these are located at the Tha Tien Pier which is located 8 stops north of Sathorn Pier (the main commuting pier in Bangkok)... Another notable area is \"Chinatown\" which can be reached by Ratchawong Pier which is 5 stops north of Sathorn Pier... Sathorn Pier can easily be reached by the BTS/Skytrain at Saphan Taksin Station (S6)... The pier is located under the BTS/Skytrain Station... So, if you are interested in these or many of the other attractions along the river it is truly worth doing it from the water...

Then hire a long tail boat (we paid 800THB for 3 people for an hour) to take you through the ancient canals of the real old BKK."

The royal barges can be seen in their sheds near the naval base.Transport by barge huge barges pulled by 1 or 2 tiny tugs are a familiar sight.

The tourist ferries do not stop at all of the wharfs, but they do go to those that serve the major tourist attractions and you can easily spend a entire day moving seamlessly and easily between many of the must see sites. If you are so minded, the Day Pass also allows you to use the Express ferries which are favoured by the locals. The downside is that the river is very polluted. Experienced users of the ferries (i.e locals) can be seen covering their mouth and nose to avoid being splashed with water from the river, and it is a very sensible precaution. Buy a cheap mouth / nose mask from a pharmacy for a couple of baht and the problem is solved."

Yes you will see numerous temples etc, but so will also see how the other half of Thailand lives, in dilapidated wooden shacks with corrugated iron roofs, rotten wooden floors with holes in the floor which double as toilet facilities while children are outside fishing in the river. And just when you think you have seen everything, you find another dilapidated shack with a satellite dish on the roof ! This tour is a real eye-opener, and one of the most memorable days of out two weeks in Thailand. The boats themselves are amazing with their huge V8 engines. And then you get the locals in their boats pulling up alongside you to sell you food, souvenirs etc. This is a trip everyone should do - Thailand really is a country of contrasts."

Day time is good for tourist to vist temples, wholesales market for gift shop and shoes in Sampheng, cloth in Pahurat Market and Golden market in Yaowaraj. If you have time, you can do the day trip to Koh Kred in Nontaburi by public boat but should do in the weekend so that you can enjoy the local market on Koh Kred that has open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday only. Night time is another experience for this river, more beautiful but there is no pulbic boat to operate. You have to try the dinner cruise on Chao Phraya River. There are 2 kinds of cruises for wooden style and moder style that has operated for dinner for 2 hours. If you need some quiet and no light music, you can try the wooden boat. For modern style, there are many cruise with light music. All cruises have same view but after eating for one hour, you will see the different of each cruise. I would recommend Chaophraya Cruise that food is good, staffs are so friendly and entertainers. When you finish your dinner, the boat will return to the same route. The cruise staffs will invite you to dance with them so that you can feel as home and not boring if you have to see the same view again. A lot of fun on the cruise with these cruise's staffs."

In the shadow of glimmering Wats, towering condos and spanning bridges is the most taken for granted treasure of Bangkok, the lowly Chao Phraya River. Slow old barges, zippy river buses and tourist-trap party boats all ply the river in number but the story of this river and its impact on modern Thai history make this heavily polluted, murky brown, waterway a must-see attraction in Bangkok. Sure you can take a tour boat or hire a long boat to take you on a tour (negotiate your price well) but there are also a few affordable ways to experience this ancient piece of Thai history.. You can ride the boat bus down the river and back for about 20-40 baht each way (depending on how far you go), or sit on the wall over looking the river in the park at the top corner of Pra Arit. I can't remember the name but you can't miss the white fort on the corner. Another great place we enjoyed watching the river life float by was at the Thai BBQ restaurant by the ferry dock on the ThonBuri side of the Pra PinKlao Bridge (which is at the end of Pra Arit). Just walk over the bridge and you can't miss the restaurant. All you can eat BBQ and soup (you cook it yourself and its an experience not to be missed), for 165 baht, which includes free water, pop and an entire night of live music (some good, some terrible). Beer is same price as the convenience stores! If you get there and are thoroughly confused as we were. Just watch the locals and you'll catch on quick. However you see it, enjoy Chao Phraya River!

For a few Baht, you can travel up the river, and got off at piers near many of the most interesting areas, Chinatown for example, or the Royal palace complex and the Wat Arun (hopping across the river on a ferry). The easiest way to gain access is from the BTS station of Saphan Taksin on the \"Silom\" line. A couple of hundred metres walk takes you to the Sathorn pier. Depemding on what you want to do, you can eithert take the ordinary boats, the Tourist boats or the Tourist Express. If you want to explore well up river and to hop on and off freely, the day trip ticket at 50Baht isn't such a bad idea. Otherwise, if all you want to do is to use the river as a means of access, just board one of the boats and pay the \"boat conductor\" who struggles past the crowds trying to collect from the people who have just boarded.

Tourist boat more expensive, guide will point out sights but it is hard to hear and their English is not always good.

When you get to the pier, there are several to choose from, vendors will be quick to try to have to arrange for a private boat or tour. In 2008 I purchased an open ticket for the day for the water taxi. They give you a sticker then you can get on and off where you want to, visit temples, go out to eat on shore then get back on the boat, etc. The public water taxi's are roaming up and down the river. This last trip, we arrived too early to our guest house to check-in (see my review of the Sri Ayuttaya Guest House in Bangkok), so we dropped off our bags and caught a Tuk Tuk to the pier not realizing how close we were. We couldn't figure out where to purchase the day pass that I did in 2008, but learned you can purchase a one-way ticket as you load the boat. For example, we caught the public taxi and paid 40B each. A woman is there to take your money, then you get off when you want. The boat is stopping at each pier so it is quite easy. We didn't know where we were but we kept track by remembering the bridges we'd pass. We got off at a pier, I think it was 22 and walked around. In short order we found food stands and lots of yummy treats, including grilled bananas. Then when we were ready, we went back to the pier and hopped on the boat once more. This time our ticket was 30THB each. We took a guess at where to get off and hit it right, at pier 15. There is a timelessness to floating down the river and taking in life: We had fun just taking in the sites of the river. Red and golden buddhist temples, rickety houses built on stilts, other boats zooming by, people netting snails and fish, monks getting on and off the public river taxis, etc. We did learn after our most recent boat trip that the seats in back are reserved for the monks, but luckily we didn't sit there. Enjoy! I know we did."

No need to rent an expensive boat or even take the boat cruise, just catch the ferry from one of the piers in Bangkok. A ticket from the Central Pier (2 minutes away from the Taskin BTS station) to Maharaja Pier will cost you 15 baht and will take you to the foot of the Grand Palace and other tourist attractions in the city. Take the boat with the orange flag - it stops at all the piers. There are also more 'express' ferries (blue and yellow flags if I am not mistaken) that cost a little bit more and stop only at the major piers. If you want to take the Chao Phraya Express at Central Pier you do not need to buy a ticket at the booth; line up as the locals do in the area behind the booth closest to the river. A ticket collector travels on each boat and you will pay on board.The ride is cheap, esay, and fast. Locals as well as toursits frequently use the ferry service - making this one of the more 'authentic' experiences in BKK. I work in Bankok, yet this remains one of my favourite activities when I need to clear my mind and forget that I am actually in Bangkok."

However it stinks, is a fetching shade of grey and choppy and fast flowing. On the plus side - it offers regular water taxis (though making sense of these is a art in itself), it's fascinating watching minah birds perching atop and flitting between the many plants that float on it's surface, and spotting the varied architecture and shanty homes along the waters edge. offers great views of Wat Arun too.Just keep it in context as a ways from A to B and NOT a place to soak up the sun and paddle."

The best activity which you must not forget to do is visit night cruise at Chao Phraya river.It costs like 750 baht for a person i think but i recommend it.You will love to sail across the river and have yummy Thai food.They will show you Wat Arun temple which looks very beautiful at night when it is lit with lights.Well cheers hope you will like to visit it soon too."

Putting this aside we were treated to the many wonderful sights including the large temples etc, after a mile or so the boat stopped and everyone was handed a loaf of bread each. And to my surprise we began to feed the many large Catfish which would rise and jump out of the water grabbing the pieces of bread, we then set off again down river on the opposite side this time giving everyone the opportunity to get more photos etc.! When you arrive back at the pier be careful as its a free for all as you have to climb Thai style over the bow of the boat, and there are large queues waiting to get on total chaos and certainly not wheelchair friendly.

As such, the magnificent river ride down the mighty Chao Phraya was one of the must-see and must-visit site high on my list.Despite having seen the river in photos before, the sheer size of the river the moment I set eyes on it was absolutely mind blowing. Not only that. The various activities on the river, in particular river cruises, certainly makes this river one of the most active in this region.Looking at the river and how the locals depended on it, it is no wonder the Chao Phraya has often being described as the life line of Bangkok.Standing on the banks of the Chao Phraya is not sufficient to see what the river has to offer. One has to take the cruise on many of the ride available. Taking a cruise along the river is one of the best and fastest way to get acquainted with the city as most of the magnificent structures are located along the river bank.Despite the eagerness to ride on one of the cruises, I must admit I had my apprehension in the beginning. This was because no life jackets were provided. For a non-swimmer like me, that was enough to put me off. However, that apprehension disappeared once the cruise started. It was indeed a relaxing feeling with the wind blowing into your face and at the same time, getting a first hand look at how things are in Bangkok.So sit back and lets rock and roll."

Once you get to the dock, just ask around for the \"Public Boat\" and the residents will point you in the right direction.

Many of the tourist attractions in BKK may be accessed through the river, so you can conveniently hop on and off to go the temples, restaurants, Khao san road, shopping areas,etc. You should start in the morning so you can visit many places, then stay until the night, because the view along the entire river is amazing at night. The tourist boat is less crowded but until 4pm only. Beyond 4pm, you may take the public boats, which the local people use in their daily commute so it's more crowded, but you are still seated, so that's ok. I would really recommend to try both to really experience the other side of old Bangkok."

For rides up and down the Chao Phraya River only you can purchase all day tourist boat pass in advance or pay for each ride once on board, different color flags( orange, blue, etc.) mean different stops alone the river. This is an excellent way to just get around the river area. Many river hotels run their own boats for guest and River City Shopping Center runs one free to their place.

We even saw people fishing near the Piers. I don't know whether it was because of weekend, the boats were never too crowded. We always took the boat from the Pier near Taksin station. Minimum fare to Pier 8 ( from where you can walk to Grand Palace and Temple of Reclining Buddha) on a boat with orange flag costs 15 Baht per person. But if you forget to be on time, you will miss it. So, remember to be up there on the boat before the boat reaches the pier or else you\u2019ll miss it. Frequency of the boat is quite less in the evening. We never took the tourist or express boat, just didn\u2019t feel the need. Khao San midnight market is very close from Pier 13( I will not say walkable)Long Tailed boats are very noisy and emit lot of smoke. Difficult to get inside also.I\u2019d say, atleast once take a ride in the boat during the sunset. Despite the heat, wind is always so cool. You just sit in the boat, look around you and relax. The moon looks lovely from the boat and all the hotels near the river are beautifully lit in the evening. So are the bridges. The restrau near the river look very inviting and probably next time, we will get down at one of the Pier and have something. When you are on the boat, you feel what is the big deal. But later, you feel wow, it was so relaxing, wish I could sleep there on the rocking boat!! And yes, we also got to know how the Thais move their cargo in the river. I know next time, we\u2019ll book the hotel near the river instead of Sukhumvit, specially because most of the attractions are located on the banks of this river."

The locals boat was cheap and full of smiley faces and monks etc. Less than $1. The touristy boat was a few dollars but was more comfortable and had a running commentary and you can hop on and off with the same ticket. The local boat however, seems like it runs more often. Certainly worth doing the boat if you are north to get downtown and to the Grand Palace and temples and worth doing if you are downtown because it gets you easily to Kho San Rd.Above all it is a great overview of Bangkok with its mix of new and old and a hassle free way of travelling. The roads are a nightmare.There are plenty of stops. along the way and because you are moving you do not feel the oppressive heat as much as on the land. On the locals boat we made a stop off along one of the side canals of the river with houses on stilts etc. Easy access from the river boats to Wat Po and Grand Palace, as well as downtown and easy access to the Skytrain that then takes you to the more modern parts of the city. To get to Wat Arun which is on the other side (west?) of the river you get a boat from the main Grand Palace stop. It is literally pennies to make the journey and is a far cooler way to arrive than all stinky from a tuk tuk or long walk. Not quite sure how clean the river is? It is quite murky, but that could just be because it is pretty much at the end of the river and has picked up silt etc. on its long journey.The touristy boat has a little more speed to it = a bit more wind = a bit cooler temperature"

We caught the tourist boat which is more expensive to go to Banglampoo (boat stop is called \"Tha Phra Arthit\"). On both boats you can buy tickets on board. When riding on the express boats just a word of warning if you have sensitive hearing, they let off this really loud whistle when they arrive at a boat stop !!On the tourist boat they have a running commentary of the sights you pass which is good. You get lovely views of Wat Arun, Wat Rakang and many other temples, churches and interesting buildings. We did a day trip to Bang Pa In and Ayutthaya and the 2 hour trip back on the Chao Phraya was just wonderful, there was so much to see. Dotted on the riverbanks were buddhas, dozens of temples, traditional Thai houses, mosques, statues etc. It is also interesting watching all the barges and many other boats on the river.It is a great way to take a reprieve from the chaos and traffic of central Bangkok. It is also great fun catching the local boats on the other canals, then you see the real Bangkok, just be careful getting in and out of the boats - we paid 9 baht to go from Phan Fah (by the Golden Mount) to the Central Shopping area on the Klong Saen Saep.

Even paying the higher fee for the tourist boat, the ride is not expensive considering that it has eight stops where you can get on and off as you wish for the day.

An amazing mix of things to see on this trip - we took a long-tail boat around - they can be fairly uncomfortable and hard on the bum so try and get one with a cushion at least!The differences in the places you pass is incredible - from the palaces, to yacht clubs to slums it certainly a huge mix - but more real than a lot of the 'touristy stuff.'Don't go if the weather's poor or it's raining as there's no-where to hide!"

Our trip was coming to an end and we were searching for what more we can do during our Bangkok Trip and our travel agent suggested us the cruise. At first we were not interested but having nothing to do that evening me and my wife decided to go to the cruise. It was breathtaking. Believe you me. The ship named Grand Parle was superb and wandering in the river under the moon in gentle breeze was a gem of an experience. The buffet dinner was good. The live music was excellent and the whole atmosphere was too good. The Thai Cultural show was worth watching. The dinner cruise cost us 1000 Baht per person and the picked us from our hotel and after the cruise dropped us also. You can arrange this tour by contacting any travel agent whom you will find around your hotel. You will float by the side of Wat Arun, The Grand Palace and some other attractions and their views from the river are worth watching.Don't miss it."

At our jump off point at the Grand Place we were offered a free ride form the ferry stop to the Grand Palace (by the boat company). I would have rather walked, but the people I was traveling with decided to accept the free ride from the boat company. Everything was going fine, we were even given our our guide (free of course)that tagged along in the van to the Grand Palace (a five min ride). The problem started when we couldn't get rid of the guy, even when we told him we had other plans. Upon leaving the Grand Palace he gave us a sob story of having already arranged a van to a jewerly factory. Stupid us said ok, we were basically highjacked on a wild wild through Bangkok for about 20 minutes, having no idea were we were. We walked in the jewerly factory and basically I walked right out as soon as I stepped into the door, leaving the receptionist and other people standing there with their mouths open. We were lucky to get a cab back to the water front, but it cost us time and extra money. Also beware of the tuk tuk drivers by the entrance to the tour boat of Chao Phray, they were trying to tell us it would take 3 hours to get to the Grand Palace (because of the river current) I was smart enough on that one so passed on their offer, it actually takes about 30 mins. Please remeber in Bangkok nothing is free."

            "review": "Great way to see the many of the tourist sites. The Chao Phraya runs through Bangkok, its low alluvial river plain marking the mainland of the country. The Chao Phraya is a major transportation artery for a vast network of ferries and water taxis, also known as longtails. More than 15 boat lines operate on the riverways and canals of the city.Our hotel, the Shangri La was conveniently located for both the Skytrain and Pier on the river. We purchased the one day pass for the Chao Phraya Tourist Boat.With the ticket you get a small guide and map describing places to visit from the Central pier to the pier leading to the Grand Palace. This is a wonderful way to see the various tourist sites. The main temples and the Grand Palace are accessible, you do not get stuck in any traffic jams. You also get to see the riverside hotels and even get to Chinatown.The river is somewhat murky and there is a bit of plenty of flotsam and jetsam about. Whatever you do, do not jump in for a swim. There is a great deal of happening in the river and any visit to Bangkok would not be complete without a trip on the river."

            "review": "See Another Side of Bangkok!. We took one of the long boats down the river on about a 30 minute cruise. Cost us 1000 THB (about $30.00) for 3 people to have a private boat. Not only do you cruise through the 5-star hotels, which are probably interesting at night, but you get to see the locals living on the river in their houses up on stilts, fishing off their porches, and swimming. You can see some beautiful teak wood houses and several temples. The boat is fast, and because there are lots of other boats too, the water is kind of rough. We also took the public boat which was about 10 THB (30 cents) per person. It is a water bus, so it's stopping every few minutes to take on new passengers and let off others. Not nearly the experience as the long boat. There is also a ferry we were going to take across the river, but that takes like one minute, so not an attraction. There are many river cruises you can take further upstream, dinner cruises, sunset cruises, tea cruises, rice barges, etc. I think 30 minutes was enough to get the feel of the river though - as long as you're on the fast boat. Glad we went. Would go again and do a night cruise out of curiosity - maybe the water would be smoother later at night."

            "review": "Wonderful way to get around --- Make sure you see the Canals too!. If you are up for a little adventure, the River is the way to see the city. We did this with a guide from Tour with Tong (Get), and it was a wonderful experience!After taking the shuttle boat from the Bangkok Marriott Resort and Spa to one of the main piers, we jumped on one of the river ferries with the locals. Fare was 13 baht per person. It\u2019s much faster to get many places using the river instead of the streets. There is also a tourist specific boat with narration and a higher cost. The local boat makes a few more stops, but it was lots of fun! I don't know that I'd pay the extra for the tourist boat. One tip \u2013 you have to be ready to get on / off when the ferry stops --- it makes very quick stops!We hired a private long-tail boat for a couple of hours (1200 baht) for a tour of the canals and to see how some of the local people live and work. Stops included the Royal Barges Museum, Floating Market, Wat Arun and touring the canals (2-2 \u00bd hours). Water was a little rough going across the river, but much calmer once we were in the canals off the main river. We made a quick stop at the Royal Barges Museum (100 Baht / person and 100 Baht / camera) to get a little insight into some of the pomp and circumstance of Thai culture. It was interesting, but probably not on the must see list for most people. Our boat was waiting for us to continue when we were done. Further up the canal, we bought beverages from a woman in a boat as we approached a local market. This was a weekend only floating market \u2013 the Taling Chan Floating market on canal Khlong Chak Phra. This market is a little different from the floating market that most of the tourists visit, as it is primarily for locals. Foods, fruits and vegetables far outnumber the souvenirs here! Exploring the market allowed us to try several local fruits and dishes \u2014 the odd part was seeing people cooking in small wooden boats! Being with a guide that could answer questions about the local fruits and vegetables, as well as some of the Thai specialties we\u2019d encountered was wonderful. Additionally, Get was able to point us toward the local dishes we had to try. Since we sampled a number of things in the market, we didn\u2019t make a separate lunch stop. The crispy Thai noodles, the satays and the pomelos were our favorites. Along the canals, we saw people going about their daily life \u2013 cooking, washing, and enjoying the afternoon. We learned a little from Get about the spirit houses we saw outside each home (and many of the businesses) along the canal and throughout Thailand. We saw several water monitors in the water and on the rocks along the canals, as well as lots of fish (especially around the market). We finished our tour for the day at Wat Arun \u2013 The Temple of Dawn (50 Baht / person)\u2013a very steep climb but a great way to get a bit of a bird\u2019s eye view of the city. Both at the pier in front of Wat Arun and the main Ferry Pier across the river, we had to pay a 20 Baht fee for docking our boat there, since it was privately chartered. We hopped back on the local ferry to get back to the pier where we would catch the hotel shuttle boat."

I have been to Bangkok about 12 times over 30 years and my favorite thing to do is find a restaurant or bar that has a patio on the river. I could watch the boat traffic all day, there are so many different types of boats carrying things you will never see anywhere else. #1 best place for kicking back is the Oriental Hotel, if you can splurge hit it for breakfast the boat traffic in the morning is amaizing.....very good food any time of day and the view is worth the price. Just go right out to the terrace and order a pot of tea or an ice cold beer or pick up a cuban cigar and a single malt....it is best during the day as the traffic tapers off at night."

We went from The Grand Palace to Tha Chang Pier and was also told we could get a boat like the locals for around 30BHT. We could not see any colour coded options and was sucked into a boat ride to Sathorn which cost is 300BHT each. We also knew some other travellers who actually paid 400BHT each. It was our own fault as we were aware of scams but our kids were so hot and bothered that we just wanted o get going. As for the river itself, it really was a beautiful way to travel down the river."

After reading a few of the previous reviews I think that cruises and snake farms should really have their own section. Anyway, There\u2019s one thing I have done that I haven't seen mentioned that was quite fun - Crossing the river! The Chao Phraya River is a big river running through Bangkok and there are lots of interesting sites on the banks of either side. There are many, many tours and cruises to go on but even just watching the river from the land can be fun too. Unless your driving or in a taxi or tuk tuk, you can get across the river by the rafts/boats that go back and fourth all day. It\u2019s only about 4/5 baht each way and is quite a fun experience. We caught one from the pier at Wat Arun to get back to the Grand Palace area. Once the boat had enough people on, we made our way across the river through all the other bouts going up and down, it was quite hectic!"

The Chao Phraya river boats are quite an experience and a really good way to get to the Grand Palace complex. There is a stop (Sathorn) about 50m from the exit of Saphan Taksin skytrain terminus. There is lady who will take your fare - around 20 Baht to get to the stop for the Grand Palace (number 9 - Tha Chang)Basically there are 4 routes which are coded by the colour flage the express boat is flying. You want the orange flag if you want the palaces, the yellow route stops fewer times and the grey stops everywhere and takes ages! The blue really only is a one stop to Nonthaburi and probably won't really be used by tourists much. As for the boats well it's a hop on service - no health and safety stuff here, squeeze on and watch the river world whizz by. Once you understand the colour codes for the stops it's easy to work out and away you go!"

Phra Sumen Fort on the banks of the Chao Phraya River is a brilliant place to relax and escape the madness of the busy Bangkok streets. The beautiful surroundings make it a excellent place to reflect on all that you have seen and done in Thailand. Phra Sumen fort it's self was built during the reign of King Rama I. Although I never went inside I am informed that there is a museum inside which displays items found during the recent modernisation.It's a short walk for the world famous Ko San Road (if you go the right way, unlike me!) and a good place to meet some locals. While I was there I met a young student from a local university who interviewed me for here project on sustainable tourism in Thailand. For people intersent in photography it is also a good place to get some pictures of the relaxed side of Bangkok and the river."

The best way to experience the Chao Phraya in all its beauty (and might) is to take one of the numerous boats - which is nothing but the quickest means of public transportation to the locals. Just hop on, hop off and hop back on. You won't have to pay hundreds of Baht. In fact, fares start as low as 9 Baht (there's always someone to sell you the ticket onboard, just tell them where approximately you want to get off, and they'll tell you how much to pay). While it may be a bit complicated to work out the routes and whatnot, it's still pretty obvious - boats go either up or down the river."

From our hotel, the Amari Atrium, we took the subway to the Skytram's Saphan Taksin station and took a very short walk to the Central Pier on the river. We bought a One Day River Pass for the Chao Phraya Tourist Boat, which \"...provides service to nine piers, which gives access to Bangkok's most famous attractions... You can freely get on and off any pier to explore...\" Price was 100 baht and operates 9:30 - 15:00 hrs. Includes drinking water! You can also take any other Chao Phraya Express Boat within the same route area. It came with a small guide describing the sites and places to visit at the nine piers, from the Central Pier to the Banglumpoo Pier north of the Grand Palace. (The river is main transportation cooridor and you can take normal commuter boats further north and south).This is a great way to get to the various tourist sites on the river and there's a cool breeze! No traffic jams! No scams! Grand Palace area, Oriental and Shangri-La hotels, Rivercity (mall), Markets, Wats on both side of the river. We viewed this as merely a way to get to River City for our Rice Barge Tour, and didn't take advantage of this enough (jet lag!). We should have planned a day of traveling up and down the river and stopping at each of the nine sites, from Central Pier to the Grand Palace. The view of the city from the boat is worth the trip in and of itself. Definitely plan a day around this Tourist Boat."
