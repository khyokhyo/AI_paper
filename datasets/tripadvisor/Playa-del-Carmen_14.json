The transportation at our resort was slightly delayed, however Delphinus reimbursed us and we were very pleased. The experience with the dolphins is something we will never forget! The trainers were very knowledgeable and made the experience fun and memorable. We loved Delphinus!"

            "review": "Rip off. To start with a positive, the actual experience of swimming with a dolphin was incredible. It's obvious the dolphins are well cared for and happy; their enclosure area is quite big and is clean, they are always being fed plenty of fish by the trainers.The basic dolphin swimming package at Xcaret is $99 per person, but we managed to negotiate this down to $70 per person without any trouble. Our experience lasted for 30 minutes.We got to do a few tricks with our dolphin, Luara(?), and she was very friendly and calm. Her trainer was professional and was good at keeping everybody in our group (8 people) involved.Amateur photographers with expensive cameras take photos and videos of you whilst swimming with the dolphin, which brings me on to the point that ruined our experience...When we had finished our 30 minute experience which cost a total of $140, we were invited to visit the office to see the photographs and have the option to buy them. To be honest, for $140 I expected at least a few photographs to be included in that price, but unfortunately none were included. We were told that we could buy 1 photo for $40 or buy a CD with all 46 photos on for $129! It's outrageous you think it's fair to charge these prices when everyone who swims with the dolphins here has already spent almost $200 at Xcaret per person.After speaking to several staff in the Delphinus office / photography studio and expressed my disgust at these prices, I managed to negotiate buying the CD with all 46 photos, two 6\" x 4\" prints and two wooden photo frames for $70. Even at this price I was begrudged to pay for them as I know how much it would have cost them to provide these things (about $5 - $10). One of the staff actually told me they knew we could only get those photos from them so they like to take advantage of that fact! One of the staff also told me not to tell anybody else about the \"deal\" I got for our photos because it was too cheap (really?) and they didn't want other people asking for the same price - so I have told as many people as I can because even at $70 it is the same price I paid to actually swim with the dolphin!"

            "review": "Disappointing . I have to say that with regret I left feeling incredibly let down and utterly shocked. I bought the package for my friend and I to have a \"once in a life time\" experience swimming with dolphins. As much as when we actually had a chance to swim with the dolphins as enjoyable as it was, I feel the rest of the experience was, at best a huge let down. The package I was sold was $139 per person. For this we received a silver package where we would be picked up from our hotel and then swim with dolphins in a group of 4 therefore maximising the time and experience for us. This in actual fact was 3 groups of 4 people sharing 3 dolphins. Now where I understand this may sound a bit pig headed, I may as well have paid for the experience of swimming with 8 other people at a lot less of a cost as everything in the experience was dependant on what the other small group had done so most of our time was spent bobbing around whilst a dolphins swam amount us. Where all the instructors around the water were nice I have to be honest and say as a customer I felt more as though I was on a conveyor-belt. They were more interested in seeing if the other groups had finished so they could swap the dolphins around. I understand that dolphins are alive and they need to be rested and what have you, however I was lead to believe we would be treated to a 1 to 1 experience that wouldn't be forgotten. To top this when we were lead to see the photographs we were told the price which I have to say was disgusting. And still now feel rather amazed and shocked that you ask for as much as you do. You as a company I understand have to make a profit so you're able to run a business. However paying $139 for the experience alone was I feel extremely expensive for what we actually had, to then be told we would have to pay $40 for 1 picture or $129 for 12 pictures ruined my and my friends entire experience. To which at this point I walked out outraged that you charge this much money. To make matters worse we were told under no circumstance could we take picture ourselves although the other people in the other groups had their family members in spectating areas taking pictures who because they were children were bumped up to the best package for free for safety concerns as no adult was with them. This to me added insult to the whole experience. I probably will never swim with dolphins ever again. I wanted to have a memory of something special for my friend and to take home and remember but all I and my friend are taking now is a memory of feeling cheated, and to be blunt utterly ripped off.  Such a shame to end on this note. Kind regards AJ"

Our trainer, Andrea, was very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable, and the two dolphins obviously had a connection with her because they never misbehaved once. Andrea even made provision for my wife's slight disability in that she can only lift one of her arms above shoulder height and she never missed out on any of the activities.Fantastic."

We had a memorable experience and it's clear that the staff and trainers care very much for the dolphins. Our experience (max 4 people, 45 mins) was worth the money as I got an online deal. What does let it down is the rip-off prices for photos and a video. \u00a370 for a short video or \u00a330 for a SINGLE photo is robbery! There's no discount on the photos: whether it's 1 or 10, they want \u00a330 a go. As a result we bought a single photo for my daughter when really we'd have liked more...but not at that price.In my view, this Dolphins are about all that Xcaret has going for it...the rest of the park just doesn't justify the price."

            "review": "Fun, but terribly expensive!. My daughter and I participated in the dolphin encounter at Xcaret a few days ago. We did the longer, more expensive encounter where you are in the water with them for 45 min and you get the foot push experience as well. Once we were in the water, it was pretty chaotic. There were several other groups of people doing dolphin encounters also in the same pool, and I felt crowded and rushed. We only had half the pool area to use since there were 2 other groups in the same pool. The trainers were all very nice and bilingual since the group had half English and half Spanish speakers. Petting and swimming with the dolphins & the foot push were all cool experiences, but not worth $150 per person. But...the real kicker is, after you get out, they herd you into a room and show you the pictures they took of you and your family. Of course most people will want to buy pics because you are not allowed to bring a camera or anything into the water with you. After you paid $150 to swim with dolphins you want a memory of it in picture or video form. However, the prices are RIDICULOUS! They only come in packages and range from $150-300!!!!!! For some pictures! It's a money trap that's for sure. Your standing there, soaking wet, want to go dry off, and the guy is hovering over you asking you which package you want to buy. You can't buy single pictures, at least that's what I was told, you have to buy a package, which start at $150. I reluctantly chose the $250 package since it had the video included, and he immediately took $50 off the price because I said wow, this is too expensive. I ended up with 2 big 8x10's of my choice, 2 nice wooden frames for the pics, the video, and the memory card with all the pics for $200. I know that is too much and that I was taken advantage of, but what are you gonna do? Your on vacation, you just swam with the dolphins, you want pics of your experience and they know it, and they got you. I would recommend looking elsewhere to swim with the dolphins while in Mexico, as this place was crazy expensive and overcrowded."

I have to mention that this was almost $300.In 2016 we also visited the place and have spent $200 in the store + video. They charged us for the bag!!! Management should learn how to hire people with knowledge of at least basic English and to provide basic supplies for free (given the rest of the prices).On a top, if you wish your friends to take photos, keep in mind they will \"enjoy\" convinient far away location in the bushes.Management should also invest in better photo/ video equipment for expensive materials they sell.In summary- great swiming expirience with super bad management/ customer service."

We were with Luana the dolphin and she was really lovely. The place is laid out well with toilets, showers and lockers available. We wore long sleeve rashies and were glad we did. The sun was strong and we were out in direct sun for at least half an hour, more than enough for us to burn. Especially because they ask you not to wear sunscreen to avoid polluting the water for the dolphins. Afterwards we bought the photo package with all our photos (82 in total) on a USB stick plus the video of us there plus a code for the Delphinus app to get all our pics on a mobile device. We also got a tote bag and two wooden photo frames for $233 USD. It was expensive but expected at this type of attraction, this is where they make there money. We were happy to pay it having seen the pictures and video in the photo centre and knowing there were lots of great shots of the 4 of us. The place is well run, clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. Fantastic!"

The swim was amazing and the trainer (Maria), was fantastic. The experience was great and due to us having the full 45mins on our own we were able to have more interaction with the dolphin. Can't fault the swim at all. However...the photo packages are ridiculous. It's a case of all or nothing as you don't want to leave without any photos (you're not allowed to take pictures inside yourself). They should have more photo packages as you already pay quite a bit to swim with the Dolphins and some people may not be able to afford it. We purchased all photos on a USB stick which also had a 10min video on. This was the most popular package. When you purchase this, you get a username and password to download smaller sized photos so you can upload to Facebook. Their App is a little temperamental so be patient with it. All in all...amazing experience but photos cost a bomb (which is a bit out of order)."

Swimming with the actual dolphin was a dream come true for me, although it's sad to know they are in captivity but I mean being so close to such a beautiful love animal was remarkable. Each person cost $129 US and we went with another couple. The picture package for all of use was almost $300 US which was just absolutely absurd. So sad because we couldn't use cameras or our phones so we have no memory except for what's in our minds."

The staff was so incredibly rude it was stunning; there was such an overwhelming atmosphere of negativity and rudeness that I wanted to leave. Then I saw the \"tank\" where the dolphins are kept; dirty, stagnant water and not very big. I noticed right away that the dolphins all have raw open sores on their noses; I later figured out it was due to the famous \"push\" that all guests do at the end. This is where you lay in the water and two dolphins push on your feet through the water. Sure, it seems exhilarating and fun and of course makes for a good (and very expensive) photo op; but I would never would have done it if I knew at the time that the \"push\" is the cause of the raw sores on the noses. Our guide showed absolutely no love toward the dolphins; they clearly just rotate these poor animals through, forcing them to do stupid tricks, all day long every day. Then, at the end you have the option of supporting this abusive place even further by buying the most overpriced photos I've ever seen at any group activity (I've been a corporate group planner for twenty years). One photo is around $50, to buy other photos or the video, plan on spending around $300 for a group of 4-5. I am sick to my stomach that I helped support this place, and although I am sure other dolphin experiences don't treat their animals so poorly, I will never take part in something like this again. If you must do a dolphin experience, please don't go here!"

My boyfriend & I booked this excursion, via a small stall with a man named David Gomez in the Playacar resort - we got a fantastic deal, 4000 peso (roughly \u00a3150) for both of us to do the dolphin swim package with the small group of 4 people (the Thompson package was $219 American dollars PER PERSON!) - I'd highly recommend anyone book through David if staying in the Playacar area as prices on the door for this package were 3000 peso per person so we made a saving of over \u00a3100! We had booked a 4pm slot, a mini bus came & picked us up at 2:30pm & was a short distance from our hotel. When we arrived we got given lockers & sat in a benched area with a TV screen which showed videos of the dolphins, how they're taken care of, animals they've rescued etc. We sat there for around half an hour then a trainer spoke to the group about do's & don'ts etc then we were given life jackets & ushered to the water to begin our experience. Our trainer was called Maria & we had a gorgeous pregnant dolphin named Melissa. Our trainer really understood & cared about the Dolphins & you knew you were in safe hands. Melissa did various tricks with us - our favourite was the foot push where two dolphins pushed your feet so you glided across the water, you only got to do this once which was a shame! You only got 45 minutes in the water with the Dolphins too which flew really fast & the trainer kept on trying to sell us other packages which got tiring. There was a high anti climax at the end when we were faced with the prices of the photographs. You were not allowed to take any cameras with you & so the only option was to buy there's. It was $40 USD for ONE photograph!! The cheapest package was $170 USD for 12 photos on a disk. We didn't even have enough cash with us!! This was so disappointing as a lot of the dolphin swim was based around posing for the camera with the Dolphins, we realised that they were just trying to rip tourists off & so we did not purchase any photographs - the gift shop overall was ridiculously overpriced. The reason I gave this experience 3 stars was simply because at every corner they try to rip you off for something, we were lucky to get a good deal but at the end of the day 4000 peso is still a lot of money for 45 minutes in the water."

When it was our turn, they didn't give us as much undivided attention because by the time they got to us, our 30mins were close to finished. So, all we got to do was pet the dolphin, kiss it, and have it dance with us which probably was like at max a 5 min activity, but didn't get to ride the dolphin nor got to do a few other moves like the whirlpool which the other couple clearly got to do when they took us to the photo and video room. Regardless, we still bought the package anyways because we really wanted our pictures. However, as I was looking over our photos when I got home, which didn't have much diversity in them because we were limited to only a few activities with the dolphins, I could not help to feel upset and write this review after realizing how much we paid for a mediocre experience. It made our experience at Xcaret a downfall. It's such a let down."

Me and my partner have just got back from Mexico and we paid for the single person swim with dolphins. We used our resort credit to pay for this trip, therefore we didn't pay as much as some. Always check at your hotel to see if you have resort credit as you only need to pay 20% tax to use it. So it should be cost $500 but only cost us $100. When we arrived there was a lot of standing about and waiting in an uncovered heated area. It seemed it was ok to push in if you were a Spanish speaker. After seeing my frustrations at waiting we received a 'free' T-shirt! When we headed down to the area, there was a lot of sitting and watching videos whilst putting on the life jackets. I was told that I would be able to watch my partner, but from the spectators area it was incredibly difficult. Whilst he was in the water with the Dolphins he had his own team of people around him, which was great, although they too kept on obscuring my view. This was because they were filming and photographing the entire experience. The actual swimming with these animals was amazing. Lots of activities were done and it was great to see them in a natural surrounding, opposed to an aquarium. I've been to dolphin places in other countries, but the Dolphins here were really calm and happy. We paid for 45 minutes in the water, but only received 35 minutes. When we cane out, the team ushered us to a suit of Mac computers where we could privately watch the video or purchase photographs. The costs were ridiculous! $30 for one photo or $240 for the entire package with the video on USB. As it was our final day we just didn't have that sort of money. I can't help but feel this place aims its market at upper class and high end tourism. I only had $27 on me and they wouldn't shift on the price. This angered me, as they were laughing and acting like $240 was pocket money for some. They wouldn't deliver to the hotel later either, unless we purchased the $240 dollar package. The photo man laughing at me was the final straw. I complained. Funnily enough they wouldn't let me speak to a manager so I went to the sign in desk and spoke to one there. They offered my partner the chance to swim again, but we'd both had enough. I told them that it was poor service and they agreed to give me the $240 photo package for free. A lovely experience, but very poor, unhelpful customer service."

When I booked the trip they told me that for $111 USD per person, we had 4 members in our family we could have 2 dolphins to ourselves, I checked with them several times with that before I booked, they confirmed that I would have to dolphins with us. When I got there, we only had one dolphin but we were sharing a small pool other lady who is doing a private class with my dolphin. I asked him where our second often was, the man told me that only sometimes they have two dolphins with four people. I told him that we were promised to and then he told me with a foot push you to get to dolphins. I didn't want to argue with him and just enjoyed The time of the water with the dolphin that we had. My husband could not get in the water as he was having balance issues, the people that were there laughed at him and talked in their language and the whole time. They mocked him and made fun of him, it was very obvious and quite embarrassing. Once we are done they shuffled us to a room so we can look at videos and buy their pictures. They hijacked us for money. They make you feel guilty and in the end we bought a picture package for $281 USD. It's such a rip off buyers please be aware. There's nothing they can tell me once they respond this that would make it better. I got back to the hotel and we made a complaint on what they sold us and what they gave us, when they called them and told them about the complaint, they knowledged that we only had one dolphin and told us that if we came back the next day they would do everything over for free. Of course we were leaving the next day and couldn't do it. We asked for a refund or partial refund, and the flatly refused. I would never recommend this company, they are liars, the staff are very disrespectful, and the pictures are priced over inflated."

There were plenty of free time swimming with dolphins in our small group of 4. There was time to pose for fotos, play and find out about these beautiful creatures. There were 5 dolphins in our section and ours were Luana and Yakun. They were beautiful. When you come out of the water you are handed towels and taken to the foto room to view pictures and video. As we purchased a medium package last time we wasnt going to buy again but we did as these are amazing memories. We couldnt decide on package to have and as were undecided they gave us some discount. The fotos are a rip off but we knew this even before our first visit and were prepared. It all goes toward the care and breeding of dolphins and other animals od the park.

We were in the water petting, kissing and holding flippers with them. The absolute best part was the foot push where a dolphin on each foot propels about 50' to 60' down the pen. It is exhilarating and incredibly awesome experience. I would do that part over and over again. We had Beatrice as our guide and she was great.Our one and only complaint with this show is the cost of the photo's. The fees were exorbitant and if you bought one photo, you get a cheap ugly frame to put the picture in. Unless you really want the photo's and videos, walk away from buying the pictures otherwise be prepared to shell out over $300 usd for them."

Unlike in the U.S., when you do the dolphin encounter at Xcaret, you are actually allowed to swim in the large saltwater tank with them and not just stand on a platform or 2 feet of water! You do interact with them on a platform to begin with but quickly tread water in the tank as they swim around you eating treats thrown to them by the trainer so that you can pet them as they pass by. Incredibly, at Xcaret, I held onto its fin as it took me for the ride of a lifetime! Although expensive, four of us shared the price of the dolphin video and pics provided on a flash drive. Cheaper if purchased online. Lots of interactions allowed with dolphins... Four dolphins in tank with us. We got a kiss on the cheek, danced with one as we held its flippers... Too incredible!"

            "review": "Excellent experience but do research before purchasing!. Swimming with the dolphins was a bucket list item of mine, that I can now check off! It was an absolute amazing experience, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it at Xcaret. This thrilling adventure was one of the highlights of my trip to Playa and I would still recommend it to anyone going. However, I do just recommend doing some research before you book this excursion. *There are THREE different dolphin areas in Xcaret, and I was in the wrong spot, twice, before figuring out where I had to be. So make sure you find out for sure where you should go, so you don't run late for your swim time. All names sound the same.*They will try to up-sell you up until the last minute. So stand firm on what you want. *BEWARE OF THE COST OF THE PHOTOS! Of course, for such a killer experience, you're going to want top-notch quality photos. In the section I was in, my friend was able to take photos of me, but no where near the quality of what their team takes - and they purposely face all 'actions' away from the visitor zone, so the dolphin 'kiss' or 'ride', your friends/family will get the side angle or back of you, so of course you'll want to purchase the photos from them! And shockingly, they told me that each photo was $40 USD, which is actually about $55 Canadian, so I paid $110 for two photos (which I'm delighted to have) but just would have liked the head's up that this was the cost. Then I could have prepared myself.*Also, I found the training team to be a bit rude and harsh with us in the water. The one we had was obviously frustrated that some of the tourists weren't understanding her, but they didn't speak English OR Spanish, so I felt she could have done more to make them understand the rules, without being obviously annoyed and grumpy. She rolled her eyes, shook her head, whispered to her team mates, which was very unprofessional. I think if she realized we were paying over $300 for this experience alone, plus the almost $200 to get into Xcaret, maybe she'd have been nicer. So that was a bit unfortunate. The male trainer had to take over for her at one point, and as soon as he did, everyone understood him easily and the rest of the swim went smoothly.*They never checked our life jackets either - so once I was in the water, mine kept rising and I wasn't able to make it tighter so I had to hold onto it most of the swim. That's one simple thing they could do to make the excursion better.*Also, the younger kids didn't seem to have as much fun, as honestly, they were cold, and should probably just stick to the basic 'kiss' instead of the 'ride' or 'foot push' as they don't understand and couldn't follow the rules.*The photographers were every nice! Much nicer than the trainers. *The rest of the staff at the sign-in and lockers, etc were great too.All in all, a fabulous experience of a lifetime. Highly recommend it, and just be patient with them, book the best pool for YOU, and know the cost going into it! It is worth it though... :-)"

(including a 17, 12 and 9 year old) We were all allowed to stay together as a small group to interact with the dolphins. We had the lagoon and dolphin all to ourselves. The facility is large, and private. (hidden from the rest of the Xcaret park) The trainers were great, knowledgeable and obviously cared for the animals very much. The interaction you have with these amazing animals is a once in a lifetime experience. Everyone in my family felt the same way. The best part is that everyone in your group gets to \"swim\" or get \"pushed\" by the dolphins! (2 dolphins one on each foot. They push you through the water with their noses) AMAZING!! They do not allow you to bring in you personal cameras or go-pros. They have someone that takes pictures and videos of your group. Unfortunately this is where the magic of the experience faded. The amount of money that they want for these pictures and videos are a disgrace. For my family of 6's package, (132 total and the video) they wanted an additional $575. The smallest package 10 photos (none of which had our entire group together in one picture) was $270. I was prepared to spend some money on pictures of our experience but certainly not that much! What a shame it is to ruin the natural, peaceful and beautiful experience you have with the dolphins for greed and the desire to make a $$. If part of the money is truly going back to the dolphins like the photo salesperson said...I would have been willing to pay more per person for the experience in the beginning then to pay that amount for pictures."

We had a lot of time in the water and the entire time that we were in there we were interacting with the dolphins while our photos and a video were being taken by a member of staff. We were shown how the dolphin do tricks and the incredible things that they are able to do, we were able to stroke the dolphins over and over and got to do a number of tricks with them as well.

Plenty of time in the water, dolphins in your arms and pushing you through the water, kids were thrilled, trainer was experienced and explained everything. They do hit you up for pictures after.. We purchased the middle pkg. I would give it a 5.. but the ride took awhile longer than expected. I wouldn't do it again but it's something you need to experience once, especially with the kids!!"

We also purchased a day pass for everyone at XPLOR SO FOR THE DAY I am already spending about $1000.00 US Dollars. We have always wanted to go and enjoy swimming with the dolphins so I wanted to splurge since this was the only full day we had on our trip.The experience was great until the very end when you get out of the water and they escort you to dry off. Once dry you get escorted into the gift shop were they try to sell you the photo packages. 1st package for 12 ...that's right 12 photos of the 100 they took is $180 US Dollars !! 2nd package is a thumb drive with all pictures and the video they took for $260 US dollars ! 3rd is so expensive and they ship you a photo book with your thumb drive I am with my 11 and 13 year old that of course want their photos with the dolphin so I have to spend another $260 !! You should be up front with people to let them know the ridiculous cost once you are their ! I could have hired a film crew in Mexico to document our 3 days for less than this thumb drive Buyer beware !!"

There could if been up to 12 in a group however there was only 8 which was good. Once we had finished we were taken straight to the photo area to look at the photos, it was good that my partner had been watching and had the towel with him as we didn't have chance to get ready first and was dripping wet. The photos were expensive however I got a package which included all 58 photos which featured me as well as the video on a memory stick as well as 2 prints and 2 frames for 94 usd. Not sure if this was a discounted rate as they had the dolphin swim at half price for black Friday.  If so I was lucky."

We did the silver package where you spend around 45min-60min in the water with them. You can kiss, dance, stroke, interact and play with them. Everything is controlled and you are told how to stand or what to do etc. Lifejackets are given to everyone aswell as lockers. You cannot take photos as someone else does this for you. The prices are expensive. We were in a group of 4, both of us were couples who didnt know each other. This wasnt a problem but they dont give you the opportunity to take photos of you as a couple with the dolphins even though our trainer was aware we were separate couples which was a shame. We would have loved a photo with the both of us but instead had to purchase two separate photos of each of us with the dolphins. Each photo is $40 dollars. They will bargain with you on the price if you say it is too much and drop the package price... overall great experience but they do warn ladies to hold on to your bikini bottoms when you do the 'foot push' dolphins are very fast!!!

Being in a pair who both did the activity together, we didn't have this so our only option to have photographic memories was to pay the disgraceful prices they charge you here. They showed us a good selection of photos they'd taken, plus a DVD of what we did. This was all great, until they told us how much they'd cost.1 photo - $40All photos - $180All photos + DVD - $210On top of a very expensive activity, these prices are disgusting and I sympathise with any parents who have kids who want these photos after doing it."

However, at the end they offered us to buy photos for a rediculous price- 39 USD per photo, or several packages (the cheapest one was 249 USD). I think this is just too much, considering the high price of a program itself (we paid 349 for this program). I haven\u00b4t taken a credit card with me for security reasons, but the photographer mentioned that I can purchase the photos later on from their internet site...

The setting in Xcaret is lovely with natural surroundings. Very nice welcome from the staff and nice changing area. Before you go in with the Dolphins you watch a 10 minute video all about how they are cared for and their breeding programme. I don't doubt they are well cared for but I'm not sure how I feel about them being bred for captivity rather than being rescues like some of the others in this area. Your group is then assigned a photographer who will take you off to start the photos. There will be about 40 people at a time and you're then broken down into groups of 4. You are given the opportunity when you arrive to upgrade to a couples swim for $30US PP to swim alone which is worth it as you do get much more time with the Dolphins. However, we found ourselves sharing the same pool as 2 other groups of 4, which I haven't experienced elsewhere. It struck me that the pools are quite small for the Dolphins too, whilst they are natural lagoons and a reasonable depth of 4m they didn't seem to be that big in surface area. Having said that, the Dolphins certainly appeared to be in good health and happily interacting with each other and the trainers. The couples swim allowed us to interact in the water with the dolphin, have a water fight, shake 'hands', cuddle, dance, complete the fin pull and the foot push. You get less if you go in the groups. Yes it is an expensive activity but if that goes into care, that's fine. The huge gripe for me is the ridiculous price of the photos. Far more expensive here than elsewhere - how the well any I don't know! I have seen the management comments on here about some of the money going into care and research but having experience in this area, if they halved their prices they'd sell a hell of a lot more and make a lot more to put back into the Dolphins. In the groups we swam with - no one bought photos and not because they didn't want to, but because they couldn't afford to. For a video on a memory stick, photos on CD, an album with 20 photos and your favourite on printed $350US!! And for a CD with your 12 favourite photos on only - $230US!! Unbelievable. They definitely need to rethink this if they genuinely want to make money to put back into the facility and not just profit making. If you are travelling with Thomson / TUI this is their preferred facility but I would recommend you do your own research on the different facilities before you go looking into their purpose and priorities. Whilst the facilities here were nice I don't think I'd personally choose to come back to this one, although don't get me wrong the activity itself was fantastic. Shame we've come away with no photo memories."

The place is nice- has lockers, showers, changing area. They give a brief video and intro on how to handle the dolphins - what to touch, not touch. Then you head to the water. Our first group of dolphins were acting up so we had to move to another set. Apparently they were teenagers and when they want to play- they just let them at it. The next ones we met were much tamer. We did the boogey board ride which was fun as well as the dolphin handshake, kiss, and another pose. Our pictures didn't come out that great so we opted not to buy any. They are rather expensive (all packages were over $100 USD). You could buy one for $40. Overall it was a nice experience."

Not what we was told when we purchased our tickets!! Having already payed over $300 we refused to pay the additional cost and stuck with what we had!!Also, if you intend to buy photos afterwards, make sure you take plenty of money! You only get the choice of 3 photo packages (so can't pick and choose what you want) and these start at $180. For $180, all you get are 12 photos on a CD!! Having previously swam with dolphins and purchased photos in a different part of Mexico last year, these were massively overpriced in comparison.I would certainly recommend this for the experience with the Dolphins but due to the lies/misleading information and ridiculously priced photos, I can only give this a 3 star rating."

At first we were a little nervous but Margareta, our trainer, made us feel very relaxed and comfortable. We got to spend a good amount of time petting the dolphins to help us get used to them and then we did some tricks with them, such as splashing and talking etc. We both got dolphin kisses and the dolphins swam around us really fast, which was great fun! The foot push was exciting but also a little nerve wracking! Words cannot describe what an incredible experience that we had and it was the highlight of our trip to Mexico! We opted to buy photographs of our experience - the price we paid included a video and a photo in a frame. They were wonderful but very expensive. Swimming with dolphins is an expensive experience so it was a little disappointing that the photos then added such a significant amount to the cost. However, we would still do it all over again because it was amazing!"

Photos are expensive $39 for one, there are packages available from around $190 upto around $390 if I remember rightly. You will struggle to take photos on a phone from the viewing area. We used an iPhone 5s and the zoom was not good enough. Unless you have a professional camera you are going to struggle to get decent photos from the area that spectators are allowed, so be prepared to pay if you want photos. This excluded the experience is fantastic for all ages and all swimming abilities as you have to wear a life jacket."

The swim with the dolphins was amazing, however, our trip was utterly spoilt when our driver decided he couldn't be bothered to take us back to our hotel which was a 30 minute drive from the site. We were left stranded there for over one hour in the middle of nowhere. After a 40 minute wait a minibus turned up but I was shocked to see the Delphinus staff get on the bus and leave us there!! Eventually a driver from another company kindly came to pick us up and take us to our hotel. As we left the site we saw our original driver parked up the road and when he realised it was us in the van he dived into his minibus to try to hide!! I made a complaint to the holiday company as it is unacceptable to leave a woman and 11 year old child stranded in the middle of nowhere. Delphinus were unable to provide any kinds of explanation as to why we were left there and not taken back to our hotel an hour earlier as was supposed to happen. My advice, if you want to swim with dolphins and make it back to your hotel again Do Not go to Delphinus."

Last two years we did a similar activity in Moon Palace resort and we must say the experience at Delphinus was much better. More interaction with the Dolphins and smaller group (10 people). The staff was professional and nice. My autistic son, my wife and myself couldn't keep ourselve to float to be ready to be pushed by the dolphins, so a trainer was there in the water to help us all the time. As other reviewers said, the price for the pictures and the video was outrageous but if you can afford it, then buy it. They took very good pictures and good video. It will be a good memory for you to keep and share!"

I had sticker shock at the price of the photos - those and the video were $260. That added 50% to the cost of going there, but they know they've got you.

We made the mistake of missing our scheduled pickup from our hotel so we paid for round-trip taxis to and from the park - wound up more economical than the $12pp they were asking for. When we arrive, they tell us that our session already started and wasted 10 minutes trying to find someone who would know if we could enter or not. All other sessions for the day are full and we could have the remaining 10 minutes left in the session - would have been wonderful if they didn't waste our time trying to figure that out.We decide not to reschedule to another day and save all of the transportation money. The dolphin was beautiful from afar, but once you were in the water with it, you saw the scars. This particular dolphin had a cracked lip and was bleeding lightly into the water.When they did the dolphin kiss, my niece had blood on her face. Terrible.If you are going to be a spectator and take photos, do not waste your time unless you have a 55-300 or better zoom lens. The \"spectator area\" is on the side and, depending on which pool your family is in, you may not see anything. Of course, this is intentional so that you buy their pictures. Here are the details on that scam - individual pics are USD $40 each. Or, you could buy their CD-Rom with all of the pictures (about 120 for our group) for USD $280. Or the Pics and Video for $320. Or the pics, video and a book for $350. In other words, If you want any pictures from your day, be ready to shell out another $300. Mind you, this is on top of what you paid to enter and the transportation so it does wind up being one of the most-costly days you could spend in the Riviera Maya area.In all, we cannot recommend this particular park. You may have better luck with any of the other parks offering dolphin experiences."

They put in a great deal of education into the program I learned a lot. My kids LOVED it. I tried to tip our instructor (Samantha? Sandra?) but she was in the next session. Gave her tip to Rodrigo (the guy who gave us the pre-instructions and showed the instructional video) and I hope it made it to her. The photos/DVD were awesome. I went thru it all before purchasing after reading a review here where the DVD was only half a minute and poor pictures. Ours came out great. It was expensive but worth it for a once in lifetime experience. I mean I was surprised that we interacted with them so much. Even when you were going between activities just being in the same water with them swimming around other guests was special to me. I would probably do this again to be honest if my kids wanted to."

We paid a very fair price for the tickets themselves and had to pay $24USD round trip for transportation to and from Delphinus Park (plus driver's tip). The park was very clean and the staff was friendly. There were also 4 beautiful parrots sitting at different locations throughout the park. We were told that our group (the dolphin boogie surf ride) would have 10 people max in it. But we were put in a group of 9 small children along with their parents and grandparents. The children were very rude and disruptive, and I feel like the dolphins were annoyed and not cooperating like they normally would had it been all adult guests. No one mentioned this being an overbooked group, so we just sucked it up and went along with it. We honestly had an awesome time, despite the overbooking and obnoxious children! We got to do a number of activities with the dolphins and it was a super fun experience. For what we got to do, I don't think that I would have paid any more than the price we got through the resort, but like I said, it was still a very enjoyable time and I would still recommend this to anyone.Side note, you are not allowed to bring your own cameras to this attraction. No cell phones, GoPros, etc. The only way to get photographic memorabilia of your experience is if you purchase the photos that the staff took. The cheapest price for these photos started at $120USD! It really would have been nice to have some photos to look back on, but there was so way that we could 1) afford that price and 2) justify spending that kind of money when we had already paid to get in, paid to get there, and had a perfectly working GoPro that we were told we had to lock up in the lockers at the main entrance. So we just have the memories in our head instead :)"

The main criticism seems to be the price of the photos etc. we decided this was a \"Bucket List\" opportunity and booked the \"couples swim\" package. Just the wife and I, with our own dolphin and trainer for an hour. On arrival we checked in at reception and were guided down to the changing area. Here we signed our disclaimer, and changed, and were given a secure locker for all our belongings, included in the price.We were then sent to the shaded waiting area where we were able to watch an informative video regarding all the work they are doing there and the health and welfare facilities for the dolphins. I must say all very impressive. We could also watch the dolphins interacting with the other groups already in the water with them.We were then given a full safety briefing, more for the welfare of the dolphins than our safety. Following this we were issued with our buoyancy aid, and lead out to start our experience!We actually swam with three different dolphins during the session, and the trainer we were with was Pakal, who was warm and friendly, and gave us lots of information about the dolphins and their care. This was a once in a lifetime experience and it lived up to it. The Photos.For the period of your session a photographer and videographer record your interaction. Yes you may think the cost of the photos is high, but let's put it in perspective. There is no compulsion to buy - there are no high pressure sales tactics. To be honest, the cost of a single picture is quite high ( $40) BUT if you opt for one of the packages the costs tumble. The package I went for was 100 pictures, an 8x10 framed photo and the video record. This was $277. Sounds a lot but without the print and video that works out at $2.77 a picture all on a USB actually a fair price in my opinion. All in all a fantastic, well organised dream come true for us - don't be put off by any of the negative reviews and do this! You will regret it if you don't! "

There were six people in our group and only one dolphin which I thought was a bit sparse as we were watching other people quite a bit. However did really enjoy it and the trainers were friendly. The only thing that spoiled it for me was the rip off price of the photos. It was \u00a3140 (ish: conversion rate) for a disk with the photos on, we had 59 photos taken. Absolutely extortionate price. As we had nobody else with us on the day, had nobody to take photos from the spectators area. But really wanted photos to remember our experience so went for it. There were other packages they offered you too with extras such as a video which were even more money! Overall we enjoyed the experience."

Dolphins are my absolute favorite animals and getting this one on one experience with them was unforgettable. Some would say the cost is expensive, but I disagree. You're swimming with dolphins! These are highly intelligent creatures that have to be consistently trained and cared for. The veterinary costs alone must be astronomical along with the fees for upkeep and care of the facilities. We had a 2 for 1 ride, so we opted to do the highest level of the experience which included everything (kiss, hug, dance, ect.) and also decided to get the full picture package which included a dvd of our experience, all of the pictures on a usb, a printed book of our pictures from our experience, 3 printed 8x10 photos and 2 wooden delphinus frames for our pictures. To us, this was worth it in order to have our experience. The employees were great and truly care and share a relationship with these animals which I love and respect. Definitely worth the visit."

One thing to know is that the cost of pictures / video is extremely expensive. All we really wanted was the video because so many of the photos were just bad pictures but you had to buy a package to get the video. This is the reason for less than 5 stars - otherwise I like the program and that the dolphins are being born in captivity and not captured.I suggest if you have multiple people in your group that you split into two times so you can take your own photos/video."

You'll probably only do it once in your life and for me the \u00a330 or whatever is money well spent for the reminder of the memory on my wall. Also I wasn't pestered at all, I was told where the photo area was and was allowed to go there in my own time. I think you can only buy the dolphin photos from there rather than in the gift shop like the photos from the rest of the park so maybe some daft tourists need telling this."

My family enjoyed it. We went in a group of 9 (5 from my family and 4 from my sisters). Once they saw it was 2 families, they split us up (in the same tank still). We realized why...they took pictures separately so they could sell 2 different discs rather than have the pictures all in one. The least expensive option as $200 for the disc. One single photo was around $45. Yes, like other reviews, they take you to the photo booth before you even have a chance to dry off (probably to get you while the emotions are still fresh)."

During the interaction, I felt there was confusion, it seemed to me that the same tricks were being done for extended lengths to burn time. The photographer was also missing several times.All in all, not to bad of an experience, not sure if it is worth the high price. Now on to the TRAP...\"PHOTOS\". As soon as you get out of the water, you are ushered to look at your pictures, they don't even let you grab your towel, then you need to make your selection. The photos are put into a totally different sequence (not the same sequence as they were taken). This makes it hard to realize what you are actually getting. Once we got home, then you see all the duplicates (and there were many). The ONE picture I wanted, the one with the dolphins jumping over my group, was \"NOT\" even included. We ended up buying package two for $286 USD which was supposed to included ALL pictures and the video. That's the trap, they have you there, dripping wet, excited about what you have just done...so you buy pictures. All in all, not a bad experience, but really look over the pictures before you buy..."

They had a strange system where they'd charge you the full amount for the trip (Primax) of $169 then give you a refund on your return of $40. Three of us opted for the trip though it was mostly for the benefit of my 8 year old son. We were picked up promptly and the trip took 40 minutes. On arrival we were dealt with efficiently enough and given a wristband and allocated group 2. The trip we paid for gave us 45 minutes in the water with the Dolphins with no more than 4 people in a group. So far so good. The briefing was given and we had a teenage girl in our group bringing the number to 4. Mistakes happen and 2 people also appeared to be in the group and started the session before we were in the water. We pointed out there should only be 4 but were told they would sort it out. After about 10 minutes the 2 interlopers were asked to go to a different area of the lagoon. The interaction was interesting and the Dolphin performed various tricks (photo opportunities ) that thrilled our son. All in all excellent.Then it started going wrong. We were taken straight into the photo selling area, dripping wet whilst the \"photographer\" - I use this term loosely, started selecting photographs. The young girl's parents were shown a video and photos and offered a couple of packages one of which was $100 for photos the other $143 including the video. I had heard prices were extortionate but we probably would have bitten as our son had enjoyed it so much. But no, our package, which was identical to the other party in the group was $322 ! This didn't make sense so we said we could not afford that but could we look at the video which was available at $89. We possibly would have gone for that bar 2 factors, the quality of the video was quite poor and more importantly the 2 people who were removed from our group earlier were in a group of people being offered their complete photo and video package at $99 ! We were at this stage very unhappy and the photographers response was that we were on a more expensive experience, therefore the photographs were more expensive. The photographs themselves were only \"OK\". They missed several of the key moments (including my son's \"Foot Push\") and featured more shots of me and my wife rather than our son.We complained to the desk who's response was a deadpan \"fill in the customer comment card\". We reluctantly bought a single photo for $40 because our son was upset.I could go into more detail but would proffer this recommendation. If the photos don't bother you then this is a great experience, however the blatant rip-off regarding photographs is appalling. I have seen defence of the prices by management stating they are cheaper than other venues this doesn't make up for the attempted exploitation of customers."

My daughter and I booked this through our Thomson rep and we opted for the silver package which gives an hour in the water with the dolphins and up to 4 people per session. Luckily for us we booked later in the afternoon and we had the dolphins between the two of us. It was UNBELIEVABLE. We played with the dolphins, swam with them and did various tricks where they swam with us or spoke to us etc. my daughter had a bit of a cold so she left the water leaving me alone with these magnificent creatures for what seemed like hours. Physically being with the dolphins was amazing. I felt my heart beat slow down and it felt as though my blood pressure also reduced whilst in the water. Weird I know but true. The culmination of the hour was when the dolphins push you through the water by the soles of your feet at such a speed that you rise up out the water doing what I call a 'titanic' pose with arms out at your sides. This was awesome! I also had the two dolphins swim up on either side of me allowing me to hold on to their fins and pulling me through the water. I could go on and on but I won't as you just have to experience this for yourself! The only criticism is that you can't take any photos of your experience. Whilst in with these amazing creatures a photographer takes professional pics and a video. They are EXTORTIONATE!!! After paying over \u00a3100 each for the experience I personally thought that charging nearly \u00a320 for one photo and about \u00a3150 for 8 pics was way too much to ask. I didn't even ask about the DVD!! In the end I chose one photo of my experience which was a bit of a shame as I would have happily bought more if they had been asking a reasonable price."

Our dolphin was a 24 year old female, called Chiche? Umm, I don't remember the name but we felt in love with her, that's for sure. It was a memorable 45 minutes.Delphinus is located inside Xcaret Park so you need to pay the park entrace separately. Me and my partner pre-booked online and purchased Interax for total of $145 USD. It was fun sharing it with 10 other people but they have options for four people only. In our case, we didn't mind meeting other people too so it was fine.There were shelves (not lockers) provided for our stuff, which made me a little uneasy. But I never read any incident of stolen personal belongings and figured it was pretty secure.Cameras were not allowed but there is a viewing area for the public and we saw some spectators sneaking photos of their family. Since we didn't have company and really wanted photos and video, we were okay paying another $136 USD (total for both of us). Which I think was not too bad considering that it had all our pictures, probably 20 plus in total, two framed photos, DVD of the entire swim, and a cute dolphin USB. We figured it would really be expensive so we were prepared.Only thing was, the dolphin enclosures were pretty small. We asked the trainer if they let the dolphins loose after their operating hours just to have them freely swim in a bigger enclosure. He said they don't do this as it would cause a fight between the dolphins. That being said, I hope that the expensive fees would be used for taking care of the dolphins and making sure their well-being is a big priority."

We were only four in the group which gave you lots of time with the dolphins, they were so beautiful. The Dolphin push was amazing, loved it. You can take your own photos, which we did. I also purchased the video & all the photos as they were so reasonable $143. and contrary to what I read in reviews ,I WAS not hassled at all to purchase & the quality is perfect. I would definitely recommend. We had a great day in Xcaret & stayed into the night for the show"

We had the silver experience so a full hour in with the dolphins, you arrived and we were given a free tshirt each, then shown to where you could store your belongings and then onto a briefing room. Very quick briefing telling you what to expect and what you can and can't do...then once you had been kitted out with a snug life vest you were put into groups (we had 4 in ours) and taken in to the dolphins area. This was very spacious and very interactive from the minute you get into the water, we swam PAAL and Alush...my daughter who is 12 is not a nervous swimmer but they were instinctively around her alot which she loved. We did the footpush which is awesome although the pictures and noises you make are hilarious but it was totally exilerating....the trainers were very friendly and if you asked questions well that was it it was a mine field of knowledge which is great for everyone.It's expensive to buy pictures and the video but if you are going to do something like this it's worth it for the memories.I have to say this beats Discovery cove for the dolphin interaction alone and would recommend this to anyone,as this is right in their habitat...they are also into educating people and the local school kids and also a breeding program to better understand this species and also education and animal welfare, they are doing so much for this including cleaning beaches up and organising visits for disabled kids to help with their rehabilitation.What more can you say but it's so worthwhile it really is!"

Then ate at a buffet of every authentic Mexican dish U can imagine. Watched the horse show, and small parade, then rodeo type event. WOW, already 3pm! Finally found the beach/ocean and u can swim with the fish (Warm water) on ocean edge. NOW we did not do the tour (no bus), we rented a car, so if you do this, do not freak out.. the federal police will stop you at two checkpoints between Cancun and the Park.... no worse than a border checkpoint US/Mexico.

            "review": "You don't do this at SeaWorld!. We went for the 30 minute (v. 45 minute) package, which was $99 (v. $149) at the park. I suspect that the more expensive package has a few extras/fewer people per dolphin, but if you have small kids with you (ours were 4 and 5), the 30 minute package was more than plenty. It actually was 45 minutes in the water with \"our\" dolphin, but I don't think you get a few of the extras like getting pushed by it or having it jump over you (which, frankly, might have been too much for our kids). Everyone wears a life vest, and if you are with anyone who cannot swim, make sure that they are comfortable being in the deep water in a life vest. All that said: This was a blast. It might not have been the best-spent money, but it was the most fun. There is an assembly-line aspect to the whole operation, but who cares as this is probably the first time you've done this! You really do get to see the dophin up close (lots), and it's enough fun that you can easily suppress for the moment any thoughts of whether this set up is good for the dophins (probably not). At least they got a lot of fish. For the kids, it was a memorable time; adults, too. Lots of the reviews slam the photo costs, with some justification. Basically, the staff take a bunch of pictures, and then they descend on you like used-car salesman until you relent. We ended up paying $200 for all the pictures in digital files, and a mostly useless movie (terrible quality), and they threw in a print and frame. I suspect had we bargained, we could have gotten more thrown in, because it is all margin for them. If you have a large group, the pricing isn't as outrageous for the number of pictures you get (and a lot of the pictures were quite good), but if all you wanted was a few pictures, the pricing is a bit off-putting.If you are at Xcaret and have any interest, you should do this, particularly if can get pricing that's better than what's offered at the park. It was a real highlight of our visit."

Swimming with dolphins is probably gonna be one of the greatest experiences in your life - this fact proved to be true for us, but sadly the Delphinus crew did not want us to bring home the memories in form of pictures and videos unless we paid a total sum of 309 usd for the complete material on a DVD. Now - how stupid is this. You are not allowed to shoot your own images - so you have to buy a package to get any photos. This is ridiculous. I would suggest to Delphinus that they offer you 1-2 photos for free if you share them on facebook, instagram or whatever. This would both give Delphinus free marketing and the guest would be able to bring home free memories and be more likely to invest maybe a smaller sum to get the video and more pictures."

We saved a lot of money booking it online so it was well worth it. On the day the mini bus was on time to pick us up and the whole day run very efficiently. The actual experience was amazing, easily one of the best things we have both ever done. We thoroughly enjoyed it and it was well worth paying the extra for the couples swim as we got a whole hour in the water with a dolphin that stayed just with us two the whole time. I would definitely recommend the couples dream swim to any couples thinking of visiting Delphinus. Now on to the negative and it\u2019s a big one. We were fully aware of the outrageous photo prices before we went as we had looked on trip advisor before we went. After the swim you are told to go into the photo shop before you've had a chance to dry off or get changed. They then show you all the photos, which were very good quality pictures. They then show you a small excerpt of the video which also looked good quality. They then tell you the prices which are insanely expensive. In order to get all the pictures and the video it cost us $252, we desperately wanted these so we reluctantly paid it. When we got home back to England we were eager to watch the video and look at the photos. There was 157 good quality photos which we were very happy with. When we looked at the video it was 10 minutes 57 seconds long, we were told it was a 12 minute video before we purchased it. Our disappointment was then furthered when we realised the first 7 minutes of the video was just the dolphin swimming around us in the pool. We did so many activities with the dolphin yet over half of the video was just the dolphin swimming around. This seemed to be to just fill the video out to make it longer. The excerpt they show you in the shop is the best bit of the video to get you interested in buying it. The video also has music being played over the top, so when the dolphin is making noise you cannot hear it. This is one of the activities you do with the dolphin yet you cannot hear it on the video. We felt really let down by this so I emailed Delphinus to complain about the video, they emailed back straight away and sounded promising in sorting something out for us. However I didn't hear anything for two weeks so I emailed them again to which they replied. They sent me a link to download the same video again and saying that the video could be shorter than 12 minutes, this wasn't what we were told before purchasing. They didn't address the issue of the video being filled out with footage of the dolphin just swimming about. They made it seem like they were going to be very helpful but ended up being very unhelpful. Overall the actual dolphin swim experience is absolutely excellent but be prepared to be ripped off for photos and receive a poor video if you decide to buy that too."

The dolphins are phenomenal, the trainers are very knowledgeable and caring, but the photograph package was excessively expensive! We arrived at the lagoon during a rainstorm and when there was a break in the clouds we entered the lagoon to swim with the dolphins. Once on the dock we were assigned our own personal paparazzi since we paid extra to have a dolphin experience with just our family. Once we got in the water it started raining again and our personal paparazzi disappeared (understandable as they wouldn't want the equipment ruined). After a few minutes we had to get out of the lagoon due to lightning, so we waited about 10 minutes for the storm to pass. Once we got back in the lagoon our photographers did not return, so our trainer kept making us do the same stunts over and over hoping the photographer (who was now photographing a different group) would return. We could tell the trainer was getting frustrated and moved us closer to the photographer in another pool. When we finally had the pictures taken we were asked to get out of the pool and that our experience was complete.We were ushered into a photo/video hut to view the videos and photos of our group. Our video had other people on it even though we paid for the primax, but our photos were good. The price however, was craaaaazy. For $199 USD you could purchase 12 digital pictures on a USB, Or for I think it was $249 you could purchase the video plus all 80 pictures that were taken...ummmm....WHAT? We asked if we could change out of our wet clothes and let them know once we were changed-all of a sudden our sales person no longer spoke English other than the word 'no'. This was our kids first tropical vacation and dolphin encounter so we reluctantly purchased the bigger package, but are REALLY unhappy with the price...as a bonus they printed four of our pictures on really cheap photo paper and said we would get 4 frames (which we never got).I realize there is nothing we can do about the weather, and the trainer seemed just as aggregated as we were, so I will say the experience was worth it... But for our family of four the little experience cost us over $800USD for 45 minutes. Yikes!"

We got a deal because our video didn't record, if we hadn't gotten the deal I wouldn't have purchased them.I would not recommend doing the excursion in the park, it was much better going there for only the dolphins because you go in a different secluded area. Also, you get special pictures with the couples swim and instead of waiting in line for the next thing (which you do if you have more than 2 in a group) you get to touch and play with the dolphin."

We picked this complex after seeing just how much better their large natural pools were compared to some of the other swimming pool style ones in the area. They also take you through how the animals are treated and how rescue animals are rehabilitated. Would highly recommend this bucket list activity. Only bad thing is they really lock you in to buying their photos which are a little overpriced though they are very professionally taken."

I bought it in my resort (Grand Mayan Riviera Maya) and they charged me supposedly 169 USD with rate 13.3 and refunded 40 USD after visit at rate of 11USD. So, the price was not as p[promised 139 USD considering difference in exchange rate.Delphinus Xcaret personnel keeps observers so far from where your relatives or friends are communicating with dolphins that you cannot take pictures. This means you have to buy them. OK, it would be fine, but they promise 12 pictures because there are 12 activities with dolphins and you get one pic of each activity. We could not choose 12 pictures because they suck at taking pictures. They did not have all activities and they took pictures at worst moments. We liked only one picture and I asked if I could purchase only one and they said yes but 12 pictures were 100USD and one was exactly half of that. Really!!!!Also, as many stated experience was suppose to last 50 minutes, but they have soooooo many people at any one time divided in groups of 4 and 5 letting them one by one to do one activity that lasts less than a minute. Also, they talk too much between activities so total time for 169USD you spend with dolphin averages to 15 minutes with horrible pictures at the end that I had ti purchase because my child begged me to (which mother can tell no to a child).There were also a lot of restrictions as what you can do and when. You just stand there and not swimming with dolphins (ironic because it called swimming with dolphins) and trying to be quick on just petting it as it swims by you. Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.Now calculate how much money those thieves making on unsuspecting tourists: 169 per person (was about 30 people X 169=5,070; lets say half of them purchase basic package at 100X15=1,500 ---- everything totaling to 6,570). All that only for first group of people at 7AM."

Beware- if they have you walk across the wooden deck be sure you have your flip flops on. We all burned the bottoms of our feet (my poor little girls ended up having to be carried so they wouldn't get blisters) . It is a long walk (or run if the soles of your feet are burning.)The worst part was that they didn't warn us, nor did they feel bad that we were all in massive pain. Once we were in the water with the dolphins, it is an amazing experience. You can ask the trainers questions about the dolphins and they are very knowledgeable. Two of the dolphins were pregnant and we were allowed to pet the underside of their body.If you plan on buying the pictures be prepared to pay top dollar. They want over $350 for the pictures and a DVD of our 30 minute experience. Wow! That was outrageous. Needless to say, we did not purchase them, however my mother was able to get some pictures from the outside waiting area. While I would not do it again, I am glad we did it at least once in our lives."

Although a little pricey it was a once in a lifetime experience. We went with a group of four and got to spend ample time in the water with multiple dolphins. We got to touch them, do tricks, get a kiss and even have two of them push us through the water their nose to our feet! It was incredible, but the experienced was ruined with the price of the pictures afterwards. It cost almost as much as the experience itself to buy 12 photos. 1 photo was $40 and they didn't even provide an option that had me, my husband and a dolphin in it! It was either or. Then we found out that if we had a spectator with us they could have taken all the photos they wanted for FREE! It felt like a scam. The swimming part was great, but it was soured in the end."

It was on our bucket list and Delphinus didn't disappoint! the set up is very natural with fresh sea water coming in and out (know this as there are fish and jelly fish around). The Dolphins are amazing and seem really happy. What i loved about this place is that it isn't just about the tourism, they are also a conservation project and work with children with learning difficulties and provide sessions called dolphin therapy.Out of all the dolphin experiences on offer, i would recommend this one!!! Only down side is that you can't take your own camera and the pictures are VERY expensive. $39 for one picture and over $200 for all the pictures and a 10 min video. If you go as a couple they don't take couple pictures with the dolphins."

Pros: Tons to do, a beach, a man made river to float down, life jackets provided, a bag to put your stuff in while you floated down the river (I did not put valuables in it for obvious reasons). There was an inlet with tons of big sea turtles that you could get really close to. Holding tanks you could walk right up to with baby sea turtles. There was an amazing butterfly house, a jaguar island, a manatee lagoon, an orchid greenhouse. The restaurant food, and service was great from what I recall. All of the employees we encountered were very friendly. They had tropical birds, and all kinds of wild life there including dolphins, and stingrays that you could swim with, etc. Something for all age groups. We did not see the show at night, but I had heard it was awesome. The place was well worth the money to me. You can get a locker with the Xcaret Plus package which comes with one lunch buffet, a drink, and use of the snorkeling equipment. We opted for the basic package, brought a water proof zipper pouch, that clipped to a belt loop, to put money in, and paid for lunch separately. Just as a side note, there is plenty to do if you don't want to shell out the extra dough for the extra experiences. Cons: I would have given 5 stars if their bus hadn't left us there. They had 2 buses that we could take one around 5pm, and one after the night show. One hour before the supposed departure of the first bus we were out there waiting for it only to find out that it left very early, and wasn't coming back until after the show. Fortunately, they had an atm inside where I was able to get some cab money. There were tons of cabs out front. Otherwise we would've had to wait there exhausted for another 4+ hours.Tips: Bring cash for a cab, money for lunch (the restaurant took debit when I went), sunblock, a waterproof camera, swim shoes, rash guards are worth it for those who burn easily. Be prepared to take LOTS of pictures."

I was a little nervous at first because he was going to do this adventure alone (with me watching, not in the water). He was also a little nervous at first. The trainer was very welcoming and guided my son into the water and allowed him to get comfortable before having the dolphins get too close to him. Once is was comfortable, he loved the experience. The dolphins seem very well cared for and they were very appropriately trained for children. My son was able to touch and guide the dolphins, an experience he will never forget. I would recommend this experience for all, young and old."

We had the silver package (Thomson) and spent 75 minutes in the pool with the dolphins and trainer, who was really very nice, answering questions etc. Towels were supplied and transport too, and there were only 4 of us in the group so it felt quite intimate.I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed it even though I am not all that confidant in the water it didn't matter because you have to wear a lifejacket. I felt like a kid again, and that doesn't happen too often when you are 66yrs old!!!! So many thanks to the staff at Xcaret and my new best friends THE DOLPHINS OF XCARETxxxxx"

We weren't sure what to expect and were able to take some friends along with us to be our photographers etc...but what we didn't realise is that with the Silver package, you are taken to a more secluded area away from the main pools so that you are on a more personal note with the dolphins. They don't mind about friends coming, but our friends were waiting in the main spectator section and therefore missed our session - so I had to buy the DVD and photographs as it is a once in a lifetime experience for me and I really didn't want to have anything to remember the day by.There are a maximum of 4 people with 1 dolphin on the silver package and near the end of our session we had another dolphin join us.

There are many signs along the highway from the Cancun Airport to Playa del Carmen and in and around the city of Cancun advertising Xcaret. This is one place I think visitors to the area should go and really plan on having a wonderful time. I have been fortunate to have been there twice and I find it a wonderful place to visit. The entire complex is very well organized and run with efficiency. The staff are friendly and very accommodating. The grounds, pathways, bathroom, showers and changing facilities are extremely well maintained and clean. There is numerous activities to take in which are included in the price of the entrance ticket. There are other activities which cost extra but also provide a wonderful experience. When we went to Xcaret there was a sign stating that is you paid using a Mastercard your second day was free. We bought our tickets at our hotel and received the second day half price. So keep this in mind. There are wonderful authentic restaurants on the complex with a variety of delicious food items. After a full day in the sun and swimming at the Xcaret beaches there is a wonderful stage show featuring dozens and dozens of actors, singers and dancers. The show, which begins at 6 p.m.. tells the history of Mexico through colourful pageants from the early beginnings of the Mayan people on through the coming of the Spanish conquistadors, the missionaries and up to late 1800's. It depicts the culture and customs of the different areas of Mexico. A day at Xcaret is very full with activities, things to see such as the butterfly pavilion and on and on and on. So many of the activities are included in the entrance price. You do not have to buy tickets for other activities but if you so desire the option is there. Go early in the day and take advantage of the second free day. A taxi ride from Playa del Carmen to Xcaret will cost approximately $12.00 and when the evening stage show is over there are dozens of taxis waiting to take you back to your hotel. If you are staying in Cancun or even in Playa del Carmen or down the Mayan Riviera you can take a bus tour to the complex, spend the entire day and the buses return you to your hotel at the end of the day. For those people like myself who carry a lot of camera gear there are secure lockers which you can use while swimming at the beach or swimming in the underground rivers and cenotes. The management and staff at Xcaret have thought of everything that will make your day a enjoyable experience. Xcaret is a wonderful way to spend time while in Mexico. You will not be disappointed with this wonderful family attraction. There is something for people of all ages and so many lovely places to just sit and relax and enjoy the wonders of nature around you."

A bucketlist staple for many, you may go into this with a 'once in a lifetime' attitude, and you may be right, but I'd do it again if I ever get the chance. Experiencing the dolphins up close is a fantastic experience.You get briefed first, and then introduced to the dolphins in the water. We had an hour booked in the middle of the day, but you can't wear sunscreen in the water with them, so if you are fair you may want to avoid the midday slots. They seem to separate you into language groups, rather than have to say everything in 10 different languages all the way through I guess, and it's usually six people per group, but it was only us and one other English lady there so we were a group of three. This meant we got through everything quickly, so they took us to one side to talk to us about the dolphins and show us how they care for them, which was really interesting. The trainers are really passionate about it and it was lovely to see.We got to do the foot push, they jumped over us, swam around us, the dominant male demonstrated his power by soaking us with a slam of his body in a rush of speed, we played with them - throwing toys etc as well as photogenic activities like the kiss and dance poses.The photos are expensive, $39 for a 10x8\" print, and we got the usb stick with 68 photos on between the two of us which cam with a dvd. This option was $198. The photos were really good though, the photographers know their stuff and are continually snapping away. The dvd was less good, there was a lot of us in the water with the dolphins at the beginning and then the rest was a bit rushed at the end, but we weren't that interested in the dvd, we just got it because there was no package with just the photos on a usb alone.Was it expensive? Sure, but it was worth every penny. :D"

You pet dolphins, have then push you by your feet, shake hands. Then you take a twenty minute break. Back in the pool for another session. This time you are \"snorkeling\" with the dolphins. In reality, they hand you a mask without a snorkel and you tread water while the dolphin passes you by. You reach out and touch them as they go by. It is not snorkeling. That part was disappointing to me, but it is completely understandable. The dolphins are under the control of the trainer at all times. Out of the pool again for another 20m and then back in for a third session. Our third session was ride the dolphin and then a lot of line up and pet her as she swam by. So in a nut shell you really don't swim or snorkel with dolphins, you just interact with them under controlled scenarios. Happy we did it, just calibrate your expectations. They sell VERY EXPENSIVE pictures at the end. They do sell food there. The hamburgers and hot dogs cost $10 each."

First swim included the foot push, kiss, cuddle, shake, rub down and it was amazing! got some beautiful photos as well! The second swim allowed us to snorkel with them, watchign them eat fish and then try out some really cool tricks like jumping, spinning, singing, etc.Price was a bit steep, cost us $209 for the 2 swims and access to xel-ha all day and the transfers. Then to get the pictures it was a further cost, tad expensive but for a once in a lifetime thing we thought why not. Cost us $130 for 10 pictures on a cd. Truly was an amazing day!!"

We brought our friends back here after having several of our own great experiences.We loved the dolphins and the trainers. They were excellent.We already knew about the pricey picture and had warned our friends. We choose not to purchase any and we had some from our previous trips.While viewing the pictures my friends were told one price-after viewing and going to checkout they were told a much higher price. Apparently the person who reviewed our photos told us the prices for someone who has done a smaller dolphin swim. The price difference was hundreds of dollars. I can understand a change in price due to the number of photos but upon check out the cashier told our friend there was not a photo package priced for what she was told.While this was not true we say it on there laminated price list, while reviewing the photos. My husband requested to speak with a manager and was initially told there was not anyone to speak with. My husband was very persistent and finally spoke with a manger. They came to a comprise of sorts so our friends were able to get a few of their photos.I hope the photo staff has better training being told one price and then it being changed is very shady appearing even if it was a mistake."

I wasn't too keen at first but my other half was, but after swimming with them we both agreed it was the best activity wed done ever in any country!We did the Primax package which meant there was 4 of us in a group - mostly us as a couple and one other, which was really nice.. perfect! The staff are friendly and speak English well. They provide towels and lockers. TIP We booked with 'Excursion' at our hotel just next door- Xcaret Occidental, and they gave us a voucher each for 40 US dollars money back (we paid in peso so they gave us the equivalent in peso back) !! Which made the activity reasonable, giving that no matter where you are in the world swimming with dolphins is expensive.Plenty of time in the water! you did I believe 21 different tricks- all with picture opportunity, including kiss, hug, foot push, sing, dance etc.All dolphins looked happy, healthy and well looked after.The worst thing about the experience is if you want a picture to remember you experience it was about 45 UK Pound equivalent for just 1 photo!! And they took soooo many lovely pictures of you then they tell you the price your mouth just drops! There is also CDs to purchase of the experience of course extort once again. And your own cameras are strictly not allowed, however we saw other people who weren't participating in the activity but friends who came with being let in to take pictures. Its such a shame we don't have pictures to remember the experience :( but it was still worth doing."

As we were not allowed to bring our camera to the activity and realized that we'd have no choice but to purchase the photos taken by the place's photographers.The park is not inexpensive, but nonetheless we were willing to pay for the pictures, to capture this once in a lifetime experience for us and the kids.To our astonishment, we were asked for 200$ (!) for a set of digital pictures and a short video, which we found outrageous. We surrendered and paid, but not without a very bitter taste in our mouth, feeling ripped off and take advantage off.For this reason, we'd encourage people to experience swimming with Dolphins, but not in Xcaret, find a differnt place for it where you'd treated fairly and honestly."

The trainers were funny and you get a satisfyingly amount of playing time with the dolphins, but the only disappointment was that my group didn't get to hold on to the dolphins' dorsal fins as the dolphins swam as depicted in the advertisement. One word of advice I have for ladies is to wear swim boardshorts or running shorts over your bikini bottom because when the dolphins launch you into the air, you'll have to hold on to your bikini bottom to make sure the resistance from the water as you surface doesn't pull them down. Also, standing in the middle of the group during the times that the dolphins swim by for you to pet them will get you the most opportunities to pet them because being in the center allows you to pet the dolphins from all sides when they make their way toward the others in your group. Overall, the experience was quite enjoyable, I thought it was cool that Lionel Messi had visited this same attraction!"

We spent 45 minutes petting Box, playing with him, learning his tricks, getting kisses, dancing, having him jump over us and last but not least - the foot push where two dolphins push you across their pen. VERY COOL because of the one on one interaction. The trainer we had spoke English beautifully and I learned a lot in Q&A. We did pay more for this particiular experience than another dolphin experience in the same park, but we didn't have to compete with other people - it was just us and Box in the water. It was GREAT!!! They took professional photos from the dock, under the water, and video taped our entire experience...though we only purchased a couple of photos because of the cost. Loved this though - would recommend it to everyone and anyone who would like to get up close and personal with a dolphin."

We had been planning a dolphin swim with our daughter for many years and finally got the opportunity while we were on holiday at the Xcaret Grand hotel next door to the park. We chose the Primax 4 package which was very expensive but ensured good time in the water with just 4 people. My daughter and I took part, and to keep the cost down my husband went as a spectator. He had done it years ago in Florida. We knew there was a photograph package....that they would try quite hard to sell it to us....and that it would be expensive - we accepted that was part of the deal and that we would, in fact, buy the photos because they would be good quality close ups and my husband, who was carrying a camera around his neck, would not be able to take good shots from where he was.What actually happened once we were herded off to our pool was someone asked my husband which party he was with and directed him to an area as far away as it was possible to be - he could not watch our swim with the dolphins - he was at least a hundred yards away behind a barrier that blocked good viewing. There were other spectators much closer to us with good views of the fun we were having.He asked to be moved to the area that was closer and was told it was too difficult. He asked again and was given directions that took him out of the park altogether! He asked a third time and finally was directed to the right viewing area just in time for us to finish.He was very, very upset. It was a big deal for us to finally take her to swim with the dolphins - we actually chose a Mexico holiday because of this fact, otherwise we would have gone to Greece! He is convinced that he was kept away from us because he had a DSLR around his neck and therefore we may not have purchased their photos. Other spectators were taking photos but had perhaps been wiser in keeping their cameras in their bags - we obviously didn't know to be wary.From our angle as participants - we were led up from the pools after our swim and ushered into a very slick area with lots of sales people ready for us with our photos on screen. This area was air conditioned to the point of freezing and this was before we were given a towel - COLD and WET. The towels were actually in there. I presume to draw you in. I refused as it was just too cold and said I would come back when dry. I was happy too. We'd always intended to buy.The price was phenomenol....we'd excpected expensive...they outdid Disney!! I wish I could tell you the exact price, but I can't remember. But it was something like $240-260 for the DVD and a CD of 44 photos. We asked if there was a cheaper package and ended up buying just the photos for around $170 - absolutely mad!!When we got out and were talking to the other poor punters who had been equally shocked at the price we found we could have bought individual pics at $20 each - still a sting. In conclusion...the dolphin swim was lovely - we paid what we expected to pay - didn't feel ripped off in any way 10/10.But beware if you choose to use this facility - HIDE YOUR CAMERA!!!I appologise to Xcaret if I have quoted your prices incorrectly - they are ball park guesses - but very close."

Our guide was extremely friendly and informative (I forget his name otherwise I would recommend him).We did the 'primax 4' package which means that there are only 4 of you in the pool as opposed to the usual 12-13, but as we booked the first slot at 8 / 8.30am, we had the dolphins to ourselves which was a huge bonus. The photos are an absolute rip-off - $45 for one photo, $180 for the cd of photos and a dvd (12mins) of your time with the dolphins (although we managed to barter down to $160) etc etc. HOWEVER, both the photos and the dvd are amazing and we don't regret spending the $160 whatsoever. There were a couple of activities we didn't get to do which we were a bit disappointed with, but we did get to do the foot push which is pretty much what everyone goes to do as well as the kiss, the dancing and having them jump over our heads.We had a fantastic experience, but maybe shop around a bit before you choose Delphinus (although if you do end up here you won't be disappointed)."

There are many many Dolphin parks in Playa del Carmen area, and we were advised to go to this by our tour rep over the much nearer Dolphin Discovery Centre (DDC) in Peuto Adventuras. The reason for this being the group size is restricted to four and you get a full hour with the Dolphin. Other parks have groups of ten and 30 to 45 minutes for the same money. We were picked up from our hotel by the Delphinus bus and driven the 15 minutes to the park. We were given complementary tee shirts and furnished with floatation vest, had a safety talk and we were taken straight to the Dolphin pool. TBH it's wasn't the largest I'd seen, but it was right beside the sea, protected only by a stone breakwater so the water was freshly changed . I thought this was important because the DDC is set at the end of a large and complex marina were the tide and sea water changes must be much less. I'd also heard of other parks which are out in the sea on pontoons and is at the mercy of the sea conditions sea which can get quite choppy in the afternoon and the last thing you want is to be fighting the sea when you are in the pool.We had a great time with the Dolphin with constant interaction, topped off by the \"two foot push\" were you float on your front on the water with your legs straight behind you and your arms out to the sides. Two Dolphins then swim up behind you and put their snouts on the soles of your feet, they then push you forward and up out of the water until you bend your knees when they stop - great fun especially as I'm topping 280lbs.As with all this type of attraction they want to make more money from you on the photos and videos, as obviously you can't take your own and they keep any non swimming members of your party who may want to take pictures a long way away. The packages have varyingly prices and as this was on my \"bucket list\" we got the lot at a negotiated cost of about \u00a3100, yes they will haggle on the price. My only complaint is the video quality which a SD and a not very good quality, they should be shooting full HD.All in all an expensive but an excellent \"once in a lifetime\" experience."

I was scared at first because the dolphins are very big, but then i felt confortable because they started to swim around me slow and calm like saying i won't harm you. The dolphins are very smart they do a lot of tricks like clapping,singing and dancing. unfortunately everything only last one hour , when you are there the time passes really fast. I also noticed that the dolphins look welled fed and treated very nice and they are in natural water not in pool water that has lot of chemicals which is good. I defenetly would recomend this place although its a little expensive. The most expensive is the dvd and the pictures its just a ridiculous price . I purchased the usb i thought it was better and the pictures are good quality."

We paid a little more money to have fewer people with us and more activities. We found it was well worth the dollars. We spent our entire time in the water with the dolphins and enjoyed the experience we will not often be given. The foot push is by far the most fun and being kissed was a treat! I like that they have a videographer and photographer taking all the best shots. The only downside is the price for all the pictures, but as I say you never come home wishing for the money back only that you had purchased the overly priced pictures when you had the chance ;)"

Each one of us had to pay 160 US $ for this experience, as well as 30$ per picture (we could buy the whole pictures on CD for 140$...)It's important to mention that those are generally the prices of the swimming with the doplhins in all the other nearby places, but it's not an exuse...."

It is a magical experience, totally recommend doing it. Trainers were very accommodating to all guests and gave all group the opportunity to spend good time with the dolphins.One thing we did not like was the cost of the pictures and video they sell after the experience.

We got to do the \"push-push\" twice whereby 2 dolphins push you one at each foot at high speed across the pen. Fabulous. There was lots of petting and dancing with these creatures who seemed very well loved and cared for. We stayed at Secrets Capris Riviera booked through Apple vacation and the on site Apple rep booked the outing and sold us on doing the rest of the park with the enticement of getting $80 dollars off of the dolphins if we brought back coupons from the attraction, which we did. They had charged our Mastercard account but instead of crediting the account they gave us a MC receipt which is useless. We booked through AAA and they helped us make a claim to Apple Travel, to no avail. Essentially, Apple ripped us off for $80 after we had spent $4000 for the trip. Now we will never use them again. And I am writing this review. Penny wise and pound foolish."

I was quite worried as I don't swim and have a fear of water but I didn't want to miss out on this experience. For any non swimmers - yes its deep but the life jackets hold you up, my only problem was my fear of water so I couldn't relax so the instructor told me stay on the platform with another lady who didn't swim, the instructor was lovely and said it was more important to enjoy the experience than to actually swim with them. been on the platform I didn't miss out on anything really that the others did, i got to stroke, kiss, high five, get a kiss on the cheek from our dolphin and we all stood on the platform to instruct her to do tricks. My daughter who can't really swim clung to her dad and was out in the water doing her kiss etc and she loved it, she was amazed by the dolphins. The time went so quickly. afterwards we could go and look at the photos or video to purchase if we wanted, many people had reviewed saying how expensive they are - yes they are but worth it, we got a good deal - we took quite a bit of time after the swim drying off and talking to another family so we were one of the last in there to get the photos, we were just going to buy 3 which worked out about $90 but then the guys there were talking to each other and then we thought we'd get a 4th which would have been about $120 odd as we were about to ask for a fourth they said we can offer you all 54 photos on a disc for $123! so we went for that, don't know if it was because we were the last there or what but what a deal! we went back to pay for the disc after 15 mins (developing time) and they put it in their computer and show you to check its all gone on the disc ok. disc worked fine on home laptop. overall an unforgettable experience.only negative was we think the dolphin area should have its own locker area, we put our stuff in a locker very close to the dolphin area but then we had to leave our shoes and xcaret towels (which if lost was charged) on a step in there, you need towels to dry off after especially with a child who was cold, so maybe lockers would be a good idea but certainly didn't affect our experience."

My husband and I were on our honeymoon and swimming with the dolphins was something I always wanted to do so we decided to book it through our hotel. It was 159.00 pp for a 60 minute dolphin adventure including transportation from Playa Del Carmen and a group of 4 people MAX. Our shuttle was on time and the shuttle driver funny and spoke good English... when we got there it was slow to check in taking about 10 minutes per person and only 2 people checking in. We got into our suits and then got sat in a room to watch a movie about dolphins for about 25 minutes. When they came to split us into groups it was confusing and not well organized... basically giving every group a number between 1-9 and you had to remember your number as that is where you are to go but they would forgot which group had which number so it took a lot longer then it had to and I think this could have been organized way better. We got to our group and got in the water with our dolphin and it was great! Dolphins are well behaved and very well treated and trained. We got to touch her, got kiss, danced, she jumped over us with another dolphin, we got to do the foot push, splashed, she sang songs... it was AMAZING to spend time with such an amazing mammal. However the directions from the trainers was less then ideal.... there was one big area that was split into 6 sections and you are constantly having to move from one plat form to another. During the foot push you are working with 2 trainers on either side of you on the dock and 2 dolphins and one trainer is telling you one thing and another trainer telling you different and its hard to hear because of this I almost didn't get to do the dolphin push-- it's very confusing. All in all the dolphins were a 5 star and the staff about a 2.5-3 star. Oh and the photo's were so over priced.1 8x10 photo which is the smallest you can get is 30.00 or all photos on disk for 130.00!!!!"

The rapport that Jon has with his dolphins and that he created with us made it very special and a highlight of our time in Mexico.

We were picked up on the morning by a representative from Delphinus. Quick journey took us to the park where we were taken to the dolphins. You hand over your ticket and in return you get a locker key, ticket and our package meant we got a free t-shirt. Off to the changing rooms next where you put all your stuff in a locker and go to a briefing where you are put in groups depending on your ticket. You get a quick briefing about the dolphins and where you can touch them and then you are taking by your trainer to the part of the pool your dolphin is in. Our dolphin was called Kak and we were with one other couple. Experience was intimate with only 4 people and we got to do loads of things. This included a foot push (totally amazing), a kiss, stroking the dolphin and lots more. Totally recommend this and great value for money. Total time in the pool was an hour. Be aware.....at the pool side they have a rep taking a video and pictures of your experience. Once they take you to see them it is hard to resist. A single picture is $28 US dollars and to buy all your pictures on a disk $128 US dollars. They have packages which we purchased and for $173 US dollars you get all your pictures, CD if your experience and 4 printed pictures. A bit pricey but good quality. Just take plenty of cash!!!"

An individual picture was $29 USD each. If you wanted just the CD of your medium resolution pictures it was $163.00 USD. And if you wanted video and CD then it was almost $300 USD. We thought we'd use the Gopro camera so we didn't bring any extra money and found out that we didn't have enough money to get much. They will bring the video/CD to your hotel afterwards, but there is a charge and then it is cash only (no credit card) so we were out of luck as we didn't bring much cash to Mexico with us. We managed to purchase 2 pictures (1 of each of our kids) and that was it. Plus they didn't take any \"group\" family shots just individual.

The trainers appeared to have a wonderful relationship with the dolphins. I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to recommend."

The park is clean, the staff is very attentive and nice. We had a blast! The actual time spent with the dolphins was magical. Petting them was the best! I would highly recommend this attraction."

Just got back to the hotel from Delphinus having been a \"trainer for the day\" the strange thing is this doesn't get promoted much as an option. We only knew about it from the reviews on trip advisor. You do pay a bit more ($199.00) but you have 5 sessions and spend close to 3 hours with the dolphins. You do all of the main activities and a whole lot more. The foot push, fin pull, kiss and dance etc. You also learn a whole lot about the facility and the research they do. There was a small group of us, only 4 so we had loads of time with each activity. This is a long day that starts at 7.00am with the pickup from the hotel and you get picked up from the centre to go back at 5.00pm but it flies by. We did a few extras too. A push with a boogie board and the foot push twice. It was better the second time. You will see from the reviews that the photo's are expensive but if you go it won't come as a surprise. We bought the photo package for $123.00 but we got 110 photos on a cd for that rather than $29.00 each. I would do this again in a heartbeat. The staff are all brilliant and really love the dolphins and they are looked after really well. Jon was excellent and funny too. A day to remember."

Very good overall experience (would be excellent if the photos and videos thing didn't happen).Hated being charged for pictures and videos at the end, and still wet after the swim, being thrown inside a room with A/C below 20\u00ba to review pictures/videos and buy them eventually (be aware you cannot take pictures nor videos inside,during the visit)!Beside this, everything was really excellent and a lifetime experience.We spent over 700 USD at Xcaret during one day (two persons) and spent a full day there.The dolphins itself i think it's about 30minutes.Be aware, this place (xcaret) is one of the most touristic places in the area, so it can be crowded. Although, the area is big enough. I think we did everything we could in here.The cenotes, the snorkeling along the coast, the dolphins experience, the night show with dinner, and much more.Worth for the experience and would not regret any of the options we took.Being said that, the pictures and videos should be a gift/offer to their visitors, and not charge a large amount of dolars for having it it (i don't remember exactly for for sure more than $70 usd for a CD with everything). After paying $175 each person for swimming with dolphins, i don't think it's acceptable doing this."

They provided everything needed and had us watch a videotape before proceeding with the activities. Everything was explained thoroughly in English so I felt very safe and confident with the trainer. The experience was well worth the money spent for the program we purchased. We completed every activity indicated and when we were done they took into the giftshop to view our Dvd and then the photos. At the cost of the photos it was more cost effective to purchase the Cd with our 43 photos however the Dvd cort of $169 I thought was way to pricey after agreeing to pay $123 for the Cd of photos not to mention I was not prepared to spend that kind of money since I did not have my credit card with me and did not feel safe carrying too much cash in a foreign country."

Our family which included 11 people total just visited XPLOR as part of our Cancun Mexico trip in October during the Dia De los Muerte celebration. We had a great time and I have to say this was the highlight of my entire week in Mexico!We didn't have to wait too long in the lines for any of the circuits, including ziplines, atv drive, cave river swim or cave rafting. It was nice because everything you could do the Half version or the longer version...I personally was done with the ziplines after the first 7, but thats just because i was hungry and stairclimbing on an empty stomach was rough! You could fit the longer version of each little adventure in and still be able to do them all AND eat lunch and have some down time. There wasn't any set schedule either, so you could do what you wanted when you wanted.I enjoyed the fact that the food was buffet style and you could eat all day at your leisure. It was also very nice to have little beverage cafes spread out between the activities to rehydrate with tropical shakes, juices and cookies and coffee. Some things I would be sure to bring that are absolute musts...Sunscreen, water bottle, watersocks, dry clothes, cell phone (just in case....transportation was iffy) Sunglasses are a hassle and can get lost everywhere, you are in caves half the time anyway and wont need them... same with a hat.As for the transportation provided by xcaret, the bus driver was very friendly....however make sure that you are 100% clear on what time to be back to the bus before they leave the park. They said this information in Spanish and forgot to mention in english so some of our family almost missed the bus and were a little hesitant to wait for them. Im glad we did wait an extra 15 minutes because sure enought they were still in the park and did not catch a different bus like the xcaret workers suggested. This was a day i wish I knew spanish. Besides this, most of the workers within the park knew enough english to make sure you knew where to go and felt safe on the activities. This was a pricey day but well worth the money we spent! We didn't come to mexico to cheap out....and the experiences in the caves were AMAZING and you get so much freedom down there to play...I will NEVER forget the cave swim...the one romantic moment my husband and i got away from our huge family! I absolutely would come back here and enjoy another day like this next time we come back!p.s. bring a cheapy waterproof disposable camera! You'll be glad you did because the pics the park take are cool, but too overpriced for me!"

We were pleased that we got some one on one time with not one but two dolphins who were very friendly and enjoyed the attention. We went for the silver package which was an hour in with the Dolphins and the \"FOOT PUSH\". If nothing else the foot push was an amazing experience and had us both smiling from ear to ear. We were filmed and photographed throughout and at the end were shown the results. We were both disappointed with the quality of the 52 pictures taken of us - most of which showed no dolphins at all. The film of us was also lacklustre and not professional. To buy a CD of the pictures and film was priced at $130 so around \u00a3100 - way out of our budget and that of the others who were around us. In the end we brought two photos that worked out at \u00a330 for the 2. The trainer we had hardly spoke english which made understanding his instructions tricky although he had devised suitable sign language. Compared to a female instructor who spoke fluent english our instructor did not give any information besides the name and age of the doplhins whereas her group were fully informed - this was no doubt due to the language barrier.This was an amazing experience but be prepared to bring a lot of money if you want to evidence your swim."

There was a 3 year old girl in our group which he accommodated and she truly was having a great time.Once you finish you go upstairs to see te pictures. They show you them and the video. $29 per photo and $59 per video is outrageous!!!! They offered an 8x10.

They also really get you with the photos. You are not allowed to take your own camera. For a disk that included the pics of our family of 4, they wanted $213. Train robbery if you ask me.

There are much more cheaper Dolphinarius places near Playa Del Carmen in Yucatan, Mexico. They charge extremely a lot for photos, videos and so on. Also the swimming with dolphins is much more expensive than other places and you get the same time and exercises with them, So if you dont have time to go to other Dolphinarius than this one would be great :)Also small problem is that there is no locker at Dolphinarius, so you leave your stuff together with all other dolphin swimmers. There is locker at the Xcaret-plus wardrobe, but that one is like 15 minutes walk from the place where you swim with the dolphins.Wish You all to have fun at Xcaret, the most amazing park in the world :)"

I must admit that the park is absolutely beautiful. But there were some things I was somewhat disappointed in; first off, it was really crowded in the underground river and the park in general. Also, I expected to see fish and clearer water in the underground river, but I didn\u2019t really see any. Nevertheless, I did enjoy looking at the caves, underground rocks and the cool water was very refreshing. I also enjoyed the beach, relaxing in the hammocks and looking at the sharks, dolphins and other animals. The food at the buffet was delicious, and the night show was spectacular! It\u2019s a true testament to the Mexican culture and makes one feel proud of their heritage. The park is large so plan accordingly. We probably just saw half the park, so I suggest you look at your map and plan out what you really want to see. Wear your swim suite and a cover up\u2026 no need for extra clothes. Take sun block and bug spray. It\u2019s a lovely, but very tiring trip."

Booked the dolphin ride package, in the water about 30mins, great fun. When you get out your pictures are available to view and purchase. $30 for an 8x10 photo is steep. $400 for the package on a DVD is robbery."

            "review": "ok attraction but do not book the dolphin ride through xcaret. My daughter wanted to swim with the dolphins so when I saw that delphinus was at xcaret I felt this would be the perfect time to experience this. I contacted delphinus because we were interested in the dolphin ride but did not see it listed on the delphinus website for xcaret. They told me that I can book the dolphin ride at xcaret but this had to be done through the xcaret website. She even sent me a video showing me of the dolphin ride which is exactly what we were interested in. I booked it through xcaret. Well first this way only gives you a voucher which you have to redeem at xcaret. We waited for almost an hour in the heat to do this. Ok no problem. I can deal with that. Then when we went to our swim, they put us in an interax swim which is cheaper than the dolphin ride. I couldn't believe it when it was over and we paid more money to get the dolphin ride and did not receive it. Afterwards we complained and we demanded the difference in our money back. They refused but brought us back into the water but told us that they do not do the dolphin ride anymore. There was no great explanation as to why this was the case. When I asked as to why it is listed on the xcaret website and the delphinus salesman said it can be done, they had no answer. They did the foot push for me and after trying to do it for my daughter two times they gave up as she was too little for the foot push. They finally gave in and did the dolphin ride for her. I can say that looking back I would not likely do another dolphin event especially with delphinus. I felt like they were human slaves and had no where to swim."

We had a fantastic time at Delphinus, we had previously swam with dolphins and didn't think it would be as good second time round but to our surprise it was even better. The pools the dolphins were kept in were bigger and more like their natural habitat and the trainers did everything up they could to ensure you had a good time. The only criticism we had was that the photos and DVDs offered were way too expensive"

This place had so much to do but we didn't get to do half of because my husband was sick and everyone else on the trip didn't want to waste money on Xcaret anyway. I ended up making the best of it and walked around by myself for a long time taking in the scenery. It was beautiful! I hope I can go back sometime and take the time to enjoy it and not worry about everyone else. I really enjoyed all the Parrots, they were awesome! Our eight year old wants to go back as well, so hopefully we can! I really wish I would have gotten in the river though....no one else wanted to, and now looking back I wish I would've just done it."

I wish I'd have had time to do everything, some stand out attractions included tropical birds, Paradise River boat trip (6-plumed Bird of Paradise!), all you can eat buffet, underground river (although sadly i did not get time to do this!), beach areas, pools (stingrays, dolphins, sharks, giant sea turtles), tropical rainforest walk & mushroom farm, butterfly pavillion and Mexican cemetry. The night show also had plenty to offer. I gave it 4* as opposed to 5 because I'm not sure about it's treatment of animals; some of the enclosures could have been a bit larger and I'm not sure about how the animals felt as in some parts they were close to very loud noise, some parrots and horses were forced to participate in the night show which was extremely noisy (booming stage speakers and 1000s of spectators cheering and hooting). Also the baby parrots being bred were shoved in tiny spaces and looked miserable. However cant make proper judgments as this might have been neccessary for their development etc. Also, felt like the whole thing was a bit overpriced."

This is one of the most beautiful places in the Tulum/Playa area. Fishing is magnificent in the azure waters. We did the snuba adventure during the morning and had a fabulous time. In the afternoon, we swam the underground river and played in the cenotes. There is one particular room at a point on the river that is spooky and haunting. It has beautiful tile walls and ceilings. When you speak, your voice echoes...yet, it is so amazingly quiet all at the same time. Enter the spooky...not to mention there are dark places that can freak a person out if they are not the adventure-seeking type. The night dinner and show are fantastic. Very entertaining and educational. We had a great time and were pooped when we got back to our resort. Well worth the money and the long day!"

We chose to go the Xcaret because of the advertised snorkeling and underground river. What we found was far from impressive.Underground river: The underground river was more of a concrete tube ride. Very little natural formation was visible, and tool marks were visible on the walls at almost any point. Live vests, mask, and snorkel are all part of the deal, but you could skip the mask and snorkel for this ride. There is nothing to see in the dark, either above water, or below. Would definitely not do again.Snorkeling in the ocean: Snorkeling was unfortunately boring. The water at Xcaret was so murky and devoid of fish that I can't imagine how they got the pictures in the literature. We were grateful we jumped in with our mask and fins before paying an exorbitant sum to snooba or use one of the underwater diving helmets. I swam along side one of the poor souls who paid for the diving helmet, and, besides an introduced anchor and statue, there was nothing at all to see.Food: Our tickets allowed us to get a free lunch at one of the restaurants in the park. While there are several to choose from, we went to the Mexican restaurant, in the hope that the food would be of better quality. While the meal wasn't horrible, the food was far from great. With grilled chicken, hot dogs, and hamburgers the hot items, it was clear the focus of the menu was American tourists.The best part was the zoo. However, even that was far from impressive. Next time we'll pay to take a snorkel or dive trip. We cut off our park trip early and headed back to our resort for some great food and relaxation."

Transport to and from the park from the hotel was included and also entry into the Park and Food. (Food was lunch at one of the 5/6 restaurants which all open at Noon but dinner is not included). The day started with 7am pickup(be advised to take your own food drinks or you end up paying over $2 (usd) for drinks like pepsi and crisps as there was not much else except in the cafe at the entrance). Journey time from the park were were taken to pick other traveller made it over an hour so we arrive nearer 10am. At first looking at the map i felt overwhelmed with the number of opportunities and activities we could explore...parrots, tapir, monkeys, deer, flamingos, cougars....please note that i was deeply disappointed to find that there were very very few animals to be seen except for the abundance of parrot and flamingos....we only spotted a single spider monkey all day and there was 1 lonely tarpir and 2 even lonelier deer...so this is not a zoo. As far as activities are concerned, as part of the all inclusive you will get the opportunity to swim/snorkel the underground river (sadly i didn't do this so can only comment that it seemed interesting but went on for several miles) but there was not a whole lot more to be done if you were not doing this other than attend the various show on at different times in the day. We decided to go to the 'beach' after we had walked around exploring the animals (the one or two we could find). The beach is not so much a beach than an enclosure of water that had been carved out of the sea....it was nice enough and cooling off in the extremely hot weather made a huge difference. In the hours after lunch we caught the flying Mayans show at 3pm and did some more walking (you will walk a lot!! in the heat) and got a great view of the park from the viewing tower. We had committed at the start of the day to see the evening show....be warned this costs and extra $75 usd for 2 people but you can still see the show for free without having to eat dinner. this kicked of around 6.30pm so we had showers again and set off to watch what turned out to be a very very great show. It ended at about 9pm and we all got back to our coaches to be ferried to bed exhausted. So we started at 7am in the lobby and were dropped off just after 11pm!! Please be warned about people trying to snare you to buy cheap show tickets at the airport as this is a con to visit a time share hotel. We bought our xcaret tickets at the airport from a uniformed agent but he turned out to be one of the time share reps and sold us cheap tickets which were not all inclusive as we found out on the day after having trouble when we went to have lunch. it all ended happily so cant complain more."

There are many vendors in Playa del Carmen Mexico selling tickets to many types of family type recreational and educational theme parks and attractions. Xcaret is one park that combines both. The major theme of the park is based on ancient and contemporary Mayan history and culture. The park has several authentic Mayan architectural structures scattered about the 80 acre park, ranging in ages from greater than 800 years to some older than 1200 years, but still somewhat young to even much older Mayan cultural relics found throughout Mexico. The park also promotes sound ecosystems for widelife found in the region, including turtles, butterflies, certain types of monkeys, pumas, etc. There are also opportunities to swim with nurse sharks and dolphins, very entertaining to kids and their parents and extended family members (but there are those who would say this is exploiting the animals.) But, all in all a fun time, with a great deal of walking for exercise, and my very favorite, swimming for over 1/2 mile with a life vest securely in place. I paid for the \"plus\" ticket which included a good buffet lunch, a free towel, free access to the cave river swim (yes, intermittent caves, all very safe,) and snorkeling mask, snorkle and fins, all for U.S. $109. I paid another $10 U.S. for transportation to the park and back. There is alot for an individual or entire family to do at Xcaret, and I recommend the experience."

BTW - you are not allowed to bring in suntan oil that is not compatible with the environment. So leave it at home. They will give you little packets of oil that won't hurt the fish or reefs (SPF 20). We went straight for the underground river, and snorkeled our way through the park. Beautiful, colorful fish! I have never snorkeled before - but even as a smoker I was able to do it! The water is a bit cold at first - only 75 degrees - but you get used to it, and it's well worth it!We then went to lunch at the Mexican buffet and listened to a live mariachi band. Food was superb! We spent the rest of the afternoon walking around. We went to the butterfly pavilion (beautiful, of course) and then to the Mayan village and ruins. We spent a lot of time in the natural pools and lagoons with their little huts (palavas) all around for shade. All in all a very, very nice day. We opted to come home on the 4:30 bus, so didn't experience the show that starts around 8. I'm saddened by this, because it has 300 people in it - I really wanted to see it, Maybe next time?The expense is worth it. We paid $79 US each, but that included a round trip ride from our hotel, which was in Cancun (45 minutes away), with all you can eat lunch; sodas and 1 beer per person. We used Best Day Travel. For a whole day of being entertained, it was definitely worth it!"

Not much to see until you exit the river and see fish, other than a few bats and a stained glass ceiling. The park is huge and is more like a zoo/aquarium. The kids loved the butterfly exhibitBack side of park has a beach area with hammocks. The Xcaret Plus program lets you eat at one of the four buffets. Buffets were average and crowded, but eat about 2:00 because they stop refilling some of the food about 3:30. The show is professionally done, and goes from 7:00 until 9:00. It is so hot and humid in the outdoor theater, you had better bring a fan. The kids swam with the dolphins at Isla Mujeres rather than at Xcaret. We let the boys go to Xplore the following day and my wife and I did not go on that tour. The boys enjoyed the zip lines but were unable to drive the amphibious vehicles due to age."

We particularly enjoyed the stationary boat with underwater observation windows and the variety of fish we saw. A couple of suggestions if you decide to go:1. Skip the tubing. The \"river\" has little current and it is difficult to paddle in the tube. Snorkel the river instead.2. You must use biodegradable suntan lotion. They check all lotions and keep any that might harm the sea creatures. They have some for sale for a semi-reasonable price. You may reclaim your lotions at the end of the day.3. The park is BIG.

Very touristy but yet have not seen anything like it elsewhere.The place is meticulously planned out with a jungle theme, beach, snorkeling area, animals shows and restaurants.Their main and best attraction are the underground swimming holes. There's a choice of 3: 1 dark and deep, 2 not so dark and deep. You will be required to use a life vest (free). I dont recommend snorkel gear cuz there's not much fish to see. I do recommend wearing fins to help move faster. There are warning signs that you should heed if you have health issues. It's about a 40 min swim without fins and the water is freezing at first but feels refreshing soon after. I saw many families with little kids crying and scared and yet mommy and daddy would carry them along. After a awhile I could see the struggle parents had carrying their kids with their arms clinging to their necks and having to swim this way for almost an hour. I say don't do it, you won't enjoy it and it is a struggle if you're not a strong swimmer.There is no one to bail you out!Although the buffets are enticing and there are many to choose from, if you get this included in your ticket know that you only eat once and when you leave the rest. that's it for $29pp. We decided to go to the ala carte rest. at the entrance. Breakfast for 4 and late lunch for 4 total was $80, so 2 meals kept us full for the day and the food was excellent.The show at the end of the day is 2 hrs! From 7-9. The 1st half was better, great costumes. By the last half hour, my back was killing me and the kids were ready to go, so we slipped out early and headed to our buses which were thankfully running and airconditioned.

When you visit it visitors can enjoy Cultural activities, some archeological places to see (I strongly recommend you do), The natural beauty of the caribbean and get to know more about a great civilization. Take a walk in \"The sender tropical\", visit the orchids exposition and experience the Xenotes (a underground rival trail).At the end of the day we got to experience a musical, that in my honest opinion, has nothing to envy those in Las vegas. The night show is just a magnificent way to see Mexico's history while dinning and enjoy a really good time"

I had read up about it before hand and even though the prices were a tad higher than other tours it sounded like an interesting and safe place to visit. The whole place is clean especially the restrooms. It was humid and very warm on our visit. We decided to do the underground river tour. It was awesome. The water was really \"cold\" compared to the air temp but once you got into the water and get used to it, it was awesome. The river takes you from one end of the park to other. The water was refreshing and crystal clear. Once you reclaimed your belongings at the end there are some awesome \"natural\" pools that are fed by the ocean waves. Ours had some pretty fish in it and the hamocks were nice looking over the ocean as well. We ate at the restuarant by the Dolphin area. It was a buffet style and was very tasty and fresh. It wasn't cheap but the quality was good. Some of the desserts were very interesting and tasty...so tasty we got the names of a few and made them when we got home! The park has a lot of animals and plants. It's a perfect place to explore and spend the day. My brother took his family there after we told him about it and they have an equally good experience. I'd go back if we were in the region again, mainly for the underground river!"

            "review": "Wish we had more time!. We visited Xcaret in late April. We bought a one day ticket with transportation from our hotel. There was a special going on where we could have purchased the second day at 50%, but we had other tours planned, so we only bought the one-day ticket. At the end of the day, we wished we had planned two days. There was so much we missed! Or, we should have taken a taxi and gotten to the park when it opened and stayed a bit later, instead of the arranged bus transportation (see below).The park is large, so planning is important to avoid backtracking. Check the maps ahead of time and decide what\u2019s important to you.  At the entrance, there is a reservations area where we made arrangements for a snuba trip (extra cost). The line was long, but moved quickly and we were through the line in just a few minutes. We then waited in line for lockers, snorkel gear, etc. That also moved pretty quickly, so we were done with all of the lines in about \u00bd hour. There are two rivers to float/snorkel in. We did the inside river and it was not so good. It was dark most of the time; there was a lot of bumping around with other people, and sharp edges on the walls. We didn\u2019t have time to do the outside river, but it looked much more interesting and easier. We chose the seafood buffet for lunch (included in the ticket price with one small glass of beer and all soft drinks). It was ok. Not the best seafood buffet, but enough to fill you up. The service was also very slow. Someone suggested that the International buffet was much better.We didn\u2019t stay for the dinner show. I understand that the show is very good, but I can\u2019t comment on it. We did purchase the DVD, but it\u2019s not the same sitting on the couch watching it \u2013 even with the homemade frozen margueritas!We purchased a snuba tour (not included in the admission price). This was like scuba diving (I think max 15 feet), but the tanks are up above the water on floats and not on your back. No need to be dive certified to do this. We thought this was one of the highlights of our entire trip! The crew on the boat and our dive guide were all fantastic. They were helpful with people that were a little timid. We were split into groups of four and since my husband and I are strong swimmers and snorkel all the time, as well as the other couple with us, we were able to go quite far away from the boat and quite far down. We saw all kinds of beautiful fish and even a sea turtle! There are lots of areas to sit in the shade and just take in the tropical surroundings. There\u2019s a small beach where you can float on inner tubes, and do some snorkeling. There are lots of exotic animals to see, as well. We didn\u2019t get to do those things because we had such a limited amount of time in the park.So, the thing we definitely would have changed would be to arrange our own transportation from Dreams Riviera Cancun. The hotel is only about 30 \u2013 40 minutes away from Xcaret, but because our bus arrived to pick us up about \u00bd hour later than it was supposed to, and because we had other hotel stops and had to wait for people, we didn\u2019t actually arrive at Xcaret for over 2 hours. We lost valuable time that we could have used to enjoy more things at the park. If using the transportation, I would suggest purchasing that second day ticket. On the way back, we were told to be at the bus stop at 4:30. We arrived around 4:20 and were told that our bus left because it was full, and we would have to catch a bus that would take us to XPlore (sister park) and we could connect to a bus to our hotel from there. After a few mix ups on which bus to take from Xcaret (were told 2 different bus numbers and ended up taking a totally different bus), we finally arrived at XPlore a little after 5pm only to be told that the bus to our hotel was full and we would have to wait for another bus. Xplore was closed and there were no bathroom facilities. One bus driver finally took pity on us and let me sit on the \u201cco-driver seat\u201d and my husband sat on the front stair. Probably illegal, but I just wanted to get back to the hotel at this point. Thankfully, we were the first hotel, but it still took us almost 2 hours to get back from Xcaret! Really, we should have just taken a taxi. We missed so much of the park due to the transportation issues.We would definitely go back to Xcaret again!"

I think if you know what to expect with their pictures, you can put it in perspective. We paid the $69...again, once in a lifetime.

When we arrived we went straight to the underground river. It was so beautiful. I have to admit that I was a little scared at 1st because we were swimming through caves and when you looked down there were very deep caverns but we had on life vests so we just kept going. It was so neat and so different from anything I've ever done. There are several places along the way to get out of the water if you want to rest. Once we got out of the river we went straight for the beach. I have never in my life seen such beautiful, clear water. This place is paradise!! I'm usually scared to be in the ocean but it was like sitting in a bath tub. You could also swim out to the fence where the dolphins are and see them swimming around. They would swim right by you so you were very up close without having to pay for a swim. After we were done swimming we decided to grab lunch at one of the buffets there. Honestly, we didn't like the food. The display was gorgeous but none of the food we had in Mexico please out particular taste (I'm sure it was just us, not them). It was also VERY over priced..but we had to eat! We walked around for a while just trying to see everything. Everywhere you look is a photo opportunity. They had a parrot sitting on a fence for people to take picture but they had to move it because a huge snake was stalking it. It's all natural there with all sorts of wild life walking around.. iguanas, birds, snakes etc. We didn't see even half of the park but we absolutely loved what we did see and probably wouldn't do anything different the next time around. I know some the reviewers were fussing about them not wanting cameras but no one said anything to us..however, we were not at any of the animal attractions. We went purely for the beach area and I dream of the day I can go again."

Plenty of fun in the water for 30-45 minutes, felt like I got good value out of it honestly and the trainers really seemed interested in their friends. You really dont need to have a smaller group for more price, I like it with 8 so you can see all the interactions with the dolphins. They all have different personalities just like us!Only downside was the cost of the pictures and dvd option. Really unreasonable. I got 1 picture of my girlfriend for $30 because it was too good to pass up. The whole pics & dvd was like $219, and just pictures was $130 or something astronomical. Didnt get to do the dolphin push, which looked fun but for an extra 50 bucks probably not worth it. Still happy we went and glad we did it!"

The short version: A fantastic and beautiful way to spend a day in Mexico; but it'll cost ya a bit.My wife and I arrived not long after the park opened and did not have to wait in any lines. I knew from friends and family who'd been before, that a special type of sunblock was required. This being the case, we left our sunblock at the resort and purchased the Xcaret \"eco-friendly\" sunblock for $16usd. We opted for the Xcaret Plus admission, (2 adults) totaling $218.00. The Plus bracelet includes a locker rental, snorkel gear and a buffet lunch. The buffet was quite good and contained a large selection of various Mexican dishes. If you plan on doing everything anyway, this will save you a little money in the long run. We did not do the swimming with the dolphins/sharks or the Sea Explorer, which all cost extra.The property as a whole is amazing. It is relatively easy to navigate with or without the park map, there are plenty of signs to guide you. There are a total of three \"rivers\" to snorkel through: Azul, Mayan and Manatee. The only time you will see fish is at the end of each, near the exits. My wife did not care for the long and dark cave portions of the Azul river, which included bats. I thought it was great.Security was not an issue. In addition to the lockers, your shoes, shirts, sandals, etc, are locked in a duffel bag (to which you possess the key) and taken to the exit points to wait for you. The animals and wildlife were incredible. My wife made it a point to hang around for the feeding of the large sea turtles. We did spectate a bit at the dolphin swimming area and it appeared to be a very fun and interactive experience. There is something for everyone here. You can swim the rivers or beach, walk around and see the animals or lay in a hammock overlooking an incredible ocean view. We did a bit of it all and loved it!!"

The cost of entry is relatively high, but the range of activities, entertainments and attractions are wide and most impressively of a very high quality. This is not the type of tatty theme park we are used to in Europe. Everything is completed to a very high standard. The park includes a wide range of activities and is a fascinating place to learn about Mayan history and Mexican/Mayan culture. I am very anti all-inclusive parks like this, after my Alton Towers, Eurodisney etc experiences, but this is nothing like that. It is full of art and music as well as wild life, examples of local skills and artifacts and exciting physical rides and activities. A complete all round experience: it even has a wine cellar with wine tasting and dining room built into the caves underground. This place is imaginative, classy and absolutely engrossing.

However, head to the underground cavern ride for a cool ride, or head to the beautiful beach to cool off. We went to the evening show and you must not miss this show. A beautiful representation of the Mayan culture with horses, parrots, dancers representing the various Mexican cultures, wonderful Mariachis, solo performances, laso, gorgeous colors...beautiful music....just an absolute fantastic show."

We rented a car and it was easy to find as it was clearly labeled. I will begin by saying that we got this excursion for free after listening to the timeshare thing at the Grand Mayan, which last approximately 90 minutes. The Park is pretty big and had lots to see, but I can't imagine paying the price it was for what you get. We had been given the plus which included an all you can eat buffet with free nonalcoholic drinks and a free beer for each person. The food was great, but if you paid the actual price it was 30 bucks and that didn't include the drinks. The secret river was free and walking around is free, but expect to pay lots of additions once inside. I can see how you can spend the entire day here, because it is huge with a lot to see. My fiance LOVED the McCaws. I would recommend going to the park after you have lunch and then eating there for dinner. We didn't stay for the night show, because it felt like a long day and didn't want to drive back to our hotel in the dark. It's a pretty park, but I would have felt ripped-off for the price. The regular ticket would have been sufficient if you don't plan to live there for the day."

I recommend you to buy either this passport (if you want to go to these three parks) or the plus ticket. There are different shows everywhere. Before entering, you get a map. The guide shows you the location of the shows and its time. Evening show is the BEST!!!! Do not miss it!!! It lasts more than two hours, it is amazing!!!

Our visit to Xcaret turned into 2 days - we had so much fun the first day, and didn't realize how much there is to see there, that we bought tickets for another day. The park is great for all ages. We went with our 6 and 2 year old kids, and both had a great time. There is something for everyone here: snorkeling in underground rivers, Mayan ruins, animal attractions, shows, food, swimming, and much more! The animals are spectacular - jaguars, various birds (macaws, toucans, flamingos, etc), beautiful aquariums with reef fish and jellies, sharks, sea turtles, dolphins, rays and a gigantic manatee. There are also wild iguanas roaming around - we were a little surprised and wary when we first w them, but soon realized they want nothing to do with us at all! My favorite animal exhibit was the butterflies. There is a huge enclosure in which the park breeds, hatches and maintains several varieties of butterflies. You walk through the enclosure - it's outside, just covered so they can't fly away - and feel as though you are deep in a jungle with beautiful flowers and butterflies everywhere. They fly free, occasionally landing on your shoulder or head! One caution: little kids may be a little scared as some of the butterflies are quite large. The other animal exhibits should not be missed - see them all!Another don't miss attraction is the snorkeling. You rent a life vest, snorkel, mask and fins (you get to keep the snorkel as a souvenir, which is also much more sanitary), and you can also rent a locker and towel. You are given a large duffel bag, as well. Then just change into your swimsuit in the changing area, drop off your towel and shoes with your bag, and it is whisked away across the park so you have everything waiting for you on the other side. There are 3 different rivers to choose from, all are accessible by anyone and no water skills are really required. My son can't swim well at all, and he had a blast snorkeling and swimming along, aided by his life vest. My 2 year old daughter came too - she can't swim, but was perfectly happy to just float along with Mom or Dad. We snorkeled 2 of the 3 rivers - both were wonderful in their own ways. One of them allowed views into some of the sea animal enclosures, and we got to see the biggest manatee ever. That thing was huge! Very exciting and fun!There are 2 different shows to see - one is a musical show featuring traditional Mexican songs and dances, and the other is a spectacular show encompassing Mexican history from the Mayans to the present. The whole show is just amazing - held in a giant outdoor auditorium. It begins with traditional Mayan games for the king, and ends with a modern song. It is all in Spanish, and even though I speak Spanish, I missed a lot of the narration. Which is ok - you can definitely follow it without understanding what is being said. My kids liked the Mayan games - a soccer-like game and \"fireball hockey\" as my son called it - best, while my husband and I liked all the songs and costumes. Do not miss this. There are also several equestrian shows with traditional charros performing intricate rope tricks and riding maneuvers. My daughter loved the charras in their \"pretty pink dresses\" :-). The food is all buffet, and it is ok. It's real Mexian food, not Tex-Mex, but steam table food. So, just ok. Huge gift shop as well, with just about anything you can imagine - the standard t-shirts and hats, as well as fine jewelry, food and Mexican handicrafts. Prices are pretty reasonable, too. If you find yourself in Playa del Carmen for nearby, you have to go to Xcaret. Do not miss it - it is wonderful!"

There is also the opportunity to swim with Dolphins although having done so before we declined to take this up. Lunch which was included on our tour and was fantastic and so unlike the fast food you would recieve at an English attraction. We were offered 2 types of tour....the early finish tour where you can make it back to your hotel in time for evening meal or the later finish tour which we did where you get to see a Mayan/Mexican show in a massive arena and this was truly fantastic. You can book a meal for the show (book on entering Xcaret) and I would recommend this as the show is a couple of hours long and then of course you have the long drive back to the hotel. We booked the meal and were given front row seats with waiter service and the food was of excellent quality. There really is so much to do at Xcaret that this review would be a mile long if I listed everything, it's an all round great day out.....GO ON IT."

Buy the plus package to spend the entire day there including the night show. the buffet that is included in the plus package will give you access to 5 restaurants, the food is fabulous. After eating the stuff in the hotel all-inclusive for 5 days, this food was a welcomed relief. I will say that if you go to Mexico and Cancun a lot, for several years, some of this will be \"old hat\" but then you get to enjoy the water activities."

There is alot of neat and fn things here for the kids to see and do, remember all inclusive doesnt mean all inclusive here, you only get one meal and one drink at one restaurant. The animals were great, the turtles were fantastic, the beach area was beautiful and the underground river is awesome for snorkling. We did go to the night show and paid the extra for the dinner and VIP seating well worth the $40 bucks seats were awesome and dinner was yummy! The show dragged on a bit but overall it was good. Long day if your hotel is close I suggest taking a cab 12-13 hours are a long day for adults little own kids. Try it out its worth the look."

They roll it, mark your number on it, cross-reference to your wrist band, and return the exact same bills to you on return of equipment. Just make sure you take $$ with you. In the future, I would not bother with a snorkel for the underground rivers, just the flippers. You have a choice of all underground, all open air, or 1/2 and half.

We did the underground river snorkel, I was a bit disappointed to see all the roofs of the underground caverns had been scraped clean, there were no stalactites to see. The water was merky at the very end we saw a few fish. The lagoon beach was a nice place to hang out. They want to charge you to do everything there. We paid for the plus tix so food and lockers were included. But were charged for everything other than one included beer for drinks even water since they only serve bottles. Snorkeling in the lagoon was lame, they have little statues for something to see since there is nothing left in the lagoon. My son and I saw maybe 50 fish in the whole lagoon. it is more of a zoo type experience with a beach than anything. Some people we went with, went to xel-ha the day after and said it was a way better time. The food is all inclusive and they got to see tons of fish and stingrays while they were there. The show at the end of the day was really cool the first half is all about the Mayan culture and e Spanish takeover. The second half had a lot of dancing ha my wife loved it, but I found it dragged on a bit. I feel you need to stay for the show to get your monies worth. If you book with best day travel make sure you get at least 10% off. Make sure you plan for a long day if you have little ones! We left cancun at 7 am and didn't return until almost 10 pm. There is one early bus that leaves at 4:30 but it feels as though you are rushed to get on that one."

XCARET is a beautiful park with natural and cultural richness of Mexico.When you enter the park, you get a map of the site marked with numbers as it is huge. So, we said we will follow the numbers and not miss anything. Well... unfortuately there is no number signs anywhere so we ended up asking employees where to go and often going around and coming back to the same spot! I don't understand how come no one has thought of this? Even the employees did not know what to answer when I asked them how come there are no numbers on the site according to the map? If you intend to go snorkling in the river you won't see much except a few fish once in a while. It's kind of a man made river. If you want to admire the environment it's beautiful.As for the Mayan show at 6:00pm it's spectacular! The dance, music and travel through Mexican history.Also, if you can catch the daily intertainement's of the Mayan shows it's worth it!As for the restaurants, we went to the La Laguna just next to the jaguar island. It is a big international food buffet and the food was great! If you decide to go to XCARET, do not book any other excursions for that day as you will be exausted... but it's up to you!

            "review": "Decent fun, but bring $$$. Brought the family from the very nearby Barcelo Maya resort to the Xcaret park and purchased a 2 day deluxe pass. The deluxe passes are to include 1 free meal at one of the on site buffet restaurants (approx $30usd value) that just about covers the cost of the upgraded pass on its own. It is advertised that it is supposed to give you a 10% discount on the premium attractions (ie. scuba /snuba, dolphin experience etc). Snorkle equipement and towels are also available for free (with deposit) with the premium pass) We were surprised that after purchasing our premium pass they tried to sell us our Dolphin experience at full price. After we pointed out the discounts we were supposed to have recieved our customer service agent had to get a manager to approve this \"special\" discount and acted like she was doing us a favor. Regardless...this place is VERY expensive. I recall it was over $900 for 2 adults and 2 children inlcuding only one premium attraction (1/2 hour dolphin swim...) for 3 guess only (I chose to sit out due to costs). And we didn't even book through our resort which would have cost more due to transport etc. (easy access by collectivo or taxi)The park is large and clean with a very basic zoo on site. A few horses, a starving brama bull etc. There is a large area with hundreds of parrots that you can walk through which was very neat. The highlight is definitley the aquariam area (sharks, turtles, stingrays etc) Snorkle equipment rental included for free with premium pass (includes towel and locker). Best snorkleing is actually right out in the ocean along the beaches right inside the park. Wide variety of colorful fish. Literally thousands of them right outside the small inlet by the beach bar. No need to pay for the \"snuba\" experience as long as you are a capable swimmer. We were able to swim right around and overtop of the paid snuba participants and enjoy the same sights for free. Even my 11 year old daughter had no trouble reaching all of the best spots. Note: Not all dolphin experiences are the same. My family got a very basic experience (watch the dolphins clap etc) vs one of the other \"tanks\" where the dolphins were jumping out of the water overtop of people etc. Not sure what it takes to get the fancier experience, but I suspect it was either the longer booking (45mins) or perhaps just the better swimmers (our group had a 5 year old in it). The family still enjoyed this greatly. They sell a video of your experience for approx $65us after your experience. This is likely worth it as photos are only possible from the \"backside\" of your family members so you can't see their smiles ;) I wouldn't say I \"regret\" anything we did at Xcaret, but at the same time there is not a lot of reason for us to return. My girls got a few of those \"experience of a lifetime\" moments which are hard to put a price on, but I did find the whole thing expensive even by a Disneyland standard."

Admittedly the experience was AMAZING and something I'll never forget -- the dolphins seemed well-cared for and well-treated, and the trainers were good. The \"foot push\" trick (where the dolphins push you, floating face-down, through the water until you're going fast enough to stand up), was incredible.And that's when they get you. After the experience is over, you are ushered into a room with video monitors to relive the experience all over again. There you are getting kissed by a dolphin, petting a dolphin, or singing with a dolphin -- heart-strings are fully tugged. You can't have a camera or video camera in the water with you, however, so at that point your \"guide\" takes out a pricelist. How much does a memory cost? The cheapest option is US$29 for each 8x10 picture that the staff takes. Full CDs and DVDs of your experience run in the hundreds of US dollars, EACH, so you could easily drop over $500 if you're not careful."

We asked to be put in another show, because insisted that we would make it time wise, but their were no spaces available.

Visited this park on Tuesday 1/17/11 after reviewing the web site and many positive reviews here on trip advisor. I wouldn\u2019t call the park busy during this time period as we were able to do just about anything without a wait or crowd. This park has \u201cplenty\u201d to do for 1 day without paying for any of the high priced upgrades like swimming with sharks or dolphins. The only upgrade we did was the \u201cplus\u201d package. For like another $29 it offered a buffet with softdrinks and 1 beer, towels and snorkeling gear. There is also a \u201cplus\u201d area of the park for the people that pay for this service where you do the lockers, changing rooms, etc. Defiantly worth the extra. We booked the tour with our airport transportation provider Trafictours.Transportation \u2013 The transportation to the park is a lot longer than on the way home. We were picked up in the hotel zone at 7:20 AM and didn\u2019t arrive at the park until probably 9:00 AM. They had our name on a list along with a wrist band that identified our package and name (this was used to scan into the park). It\u2019s only about 35-40 miles to the park from the Hotel Zone, however once the charter bus (very nice and clean) picks you up you go to a depot area where you get on the bus for the Xcaret park. They pick up in the zones for many parks, meet at the depot and then put you on the bus that goes to your assigned park. They did offer you two times to leave\u2026once around 5:00 PM and if you stayed for the night show the last bus left at 8:40 PM. (Night show ended at 8:05 PM). When you exit the guides ask you where your going (in our case hotel zone) then they put you in a line where you tell the next guide your hotel name and he tells you what bus number to get on. We where home in about 50 mins as we where the 2nd stop in the hotel zone. Travel times will vary obviously based on your pickup position. Very well organized.Park \u2013 Very beautiful park, very clean and well maintained. If you have been to an aquarium or zoo a lot of this will be review. We saw monkey, Jaguars, turtles (very small to very large), deer, flamingos, etc. The beaches are nice at the top of the park by the ocean, you can relax and have a beer and float in the tubes. The unique attraction to this park appears to be the underground river. That was pretty cool, takes about 45 mins to get to the end. They have a very nice system for this. At the beginning of the river they have a stand where you get a very large canvas duffle bag with a lock. You add all your belongings and they lock it give you the key and take it to the end of the river (river starts at the front of the park and ends at the top near the ocean). It\u2019s there when you arrive. Good to add a few bucks in there as we had to walk back and get some money as we didn\u2019t know who good this system would be. One caution note that they don\u2019t warn you about when you enter. The bottom of the river is VERY VERY ROCKY! Be careful. We didn\u2019t snorkel through the river (also glad we didn\u2019t) so we didn\u2019t have any foot protection. I didn\u2019t see any snorkel value until you get to the snorkeling lagoons up near the ocean side of the park. Also, the pathways at this park are not smooth pavement, I could see where it would be difficult to maneuver with a stroller. Also, this park doesn\u2019t have many rails, so watch your young kids very very close.Food \u2013 We ate up at one of the restaurants up by the water. Buffet had just about everything on it, along with many desserts. Some of the food we tried was great and some no t so great. I guess that\u2019s the beauty of a buffet. Service was decent. We didn\u2019t try any of the misc food stands around the park. Had we not had the plus package I think the buffet was $22.00 USDNight Show \u2013 Many people rave about the night show and that\u2019s why we stayed as well. The theater was nice, the costumes are amazing, the talent at the show was top notch. The 1st \u00bd of the show is awesome, you witness a couple Mayan sporting events, once of which is played like hockey with a ball of FIRE!. I was so pumped after the 1st half to see the 2nd. And then the 2nd half starts. This is where you have to have an open mind to the culture. It was ALL music and dance. Like I said before the talent was great, the costumes are wonderful, but I personally absolutely hated the 2nd half. That\u2019s just me."

Go for the best and be a dolphin trainer for a day - you spend hours with different dolphins not only getting great photos and video taken of you, but you also learn way more about dolphins than you'd ever expect. Delphinius definitely takes great care of the dolphins and it was such a pleasure to see them in action. Definitely a highlight of my trip!"

I was scared (claustrophobia) but their introduction video prepared me to do it. I would do it again!If you buy an excursion, plan to go directly to the \"must-see\" attractions of your day. Xcaret is WAY TOO BIG to visit everything in 1 day.Great attraction for family, although it gets chaotic at times... Especially around the locker room area. Many languages, many cultures, kids, tight areas, everyone rushing around... Bring patience! :)I recommend you go to the Xcaret tour which oversees the Xplor park and Xcaret. Really nice! Also, if you have the time to stay for the show at night, (it is not an additional cost - at least for us it wasn't) I recommend it. The 1st part of the show takes you through the eras of Mexico (mayans and Spain empire taking over...) and it's a great overview of the country's culture. We did not stay for the whole show, as we wanted to skip the chaos at the bathrooms and souvenir stores before getting on the bus... Something to think about!"

We did the river snorkel which was cool, if you know a few things first!!If you take your own snorkeling gear, that is great- life jackets are provided. Bring your own towel, or make sure you get one before you get into the river to put with your stuff. We sis not do this and had to drip dry. Since the water is a little bit cooler, it was a bit cold to not have a towel when you get out!WE looked at many of the little exhibits, before we went to the beach area to have lunch. I thought the prices were reasonable, and you can't pay for the view! We did the Delphinus experience- expensive and not a part of Xcaret, to finish our day!"

Has a nice mexican themed show at night. Meant for families for sure.If youre more adventurous go to xelha or somewhere else. The bore factor kicks into place in two or three hours.Other attractions are underwhelming like a petting zoo with mainly farmhouse cattle, chickens, and horses. Theres a parrot show and some two story mayan ruin site.Entry is $ 109 per adult with lunch and snorkel rental. Despite this, all the good activities like snuba, dolphin swimming, shark handling are extra (about $50 each activity per person). It adds up. My advice is to pay the basic entry price of 59, eat in playa del carmen (about fifteen min away), and bring your own snorkel gear (fins, mask, and snorkel will cost you $25 so it is still cheaper than the 109). Or get a discount through a time share presentation; I paid 70.....thank you enrique."

Dolphins are my pride and joy! & during my stay in riviera Maya me and my boyfriend booked a trip to Delphinus it cost around $320 and as far as money goes it was worth the cash!! It was not my first time with swimming with the dolphins as I have swam with them twice before however it was my boyfriend's first time. During his encounter with the dolphins I have never seen him look so amazed by the beautiful sea creatures. If you love experiences to remember you will love this trip. You will want to do it again and for longer. The dolphins are in a natural environment and seem very happy. They are also known for their breeding association which generally means family's are kept together. The dolphin we had experience with was called Alexa and the trainer was called Christine, both were fantastic and very relaxed. I highly recommend this experience as it's a memory to never been forgotten. X"

My wife booked the very expensive 30 minute swim-with-the-dolphin-experience... i would rather call it, have-a-photo-with-the dolphin experience... there was little swimming and the MAIN objective of the staff was for you to have pictures taken so that they could sell you for a staggering 29 dollars a photo!

It is a big place and there is so much to see and do.  We got the plus package from our hotel which was pricey but worth it. For the extra $$ you get a locker, snorkeling equipment and one visit to one of the restaurants there. It was nice to just be able to lock all our bags up and walk around with just the essentials. The restaurant we ate at was the Mexican buffet which I have to say was one of the best I have been to and we got to watch an Equestrian show while we ate. As we were staying there the whole day we brought light lunch snacks with us from the hotel and just ate a big meal at around 5 as we wanted to make the the evening performance at 6.We walked around and saw all the animals first and then did the snorkeling down the river, which was recommended to us by the hotel. I only wish we had left a little more time to do the snorkeling as there are two waterways that you can do and we only had time to do one, which was the underground caverns one, so by 3pm it was getting cold. The trip down the river takes about 45 mins to an hour. Our kids really did enjoy it though. The setting is fantastic, like a zoo but better than any zoo I have been to. Our highlights were the butterfly farm, the turtles - from babies to huge giant ones, the Aviary was amazing - so many birds and some really funny chatty ones, the aquarium was also beautiful. The flying men were unbelievable and worth going to see if you have not seen them up close before. The Mayan village is also pretty interesting to walk through and has little stalls to buy stuff, we didn't and didn't feel the usual pressure to buy.We didn't spend much time at the beach area as we thought we can do that at our hotel but it was clean and looked gorgeous. Restaurant right there and inner tubes for playing at the beach.The night show was fantastic and I highly recommend it, our kids were especially entertained by the fireball hockey game which was played barefoot!!"

There are 2 packages you can get. The 45 minute group of 8 or 10, and the 1 hour group of 4. Belive me when I tell you, even though its more expensive its worth the money. The cheaper package will cost you more if you think about it, you have to wait for 8 or 10 people to do an activity with the dolphin, so really you get only a few minutes of actual dolphin time. If yo just want to say yuo were in the water with a dolphin, this is the package for you. My wife and I got the more exclusive package, it was us 2 and a lady. the 3 of us and a dolphin for a whole hour!!! It was very hands on and it felt like it wasnt going to end. We got plenty of playtime with the dolphin and had a blast. I felt bad for the folks on the other pool standing there waiting and looking. Then we got the pictures and the video, and that was expensive too. But, its a once in a lifetime experience, you dont swim with dolphins everyday, and the memories last a lifetime, so if your going to do Delphinus, go all out and do it right. We spent almost $500 there and it was worth every penny."

The interaction with animals we never see in Canada, and close-up experiences make Xcaret so special. The trek through the park, going from one attraction to the next, is a beautiful experience in itself. The turtle sanctuary is cool as well as the display on their life span. In this area you can see sharks, dolphins, and an amazing aquarium. There are other areas to see dolphins as well closer to the beach. There are many more interesting animals to visit in this vast park. To the left of the entrance there are several buildings that are beautiful and tell the story of how Mexicans lived a hundred years ago. On the parameter of this attraction are stables where you can interact with horses and their ponies. One pony followed me around the pen to keep scratching his neck and clearly liked human contact. We decided to call him \"Chomppy\" because he like to nip at my shift.In addition to animal experiences, there are a lot of beautiful botanical displays on the grounds. There are plenty of places to eat - everything from snacks to a full course meal. The gift shops are terrific - but I have a thing for gift shops. Make sure you visit the mining caves in the main gift shop at the entrance. There is also a wine cellar that you get to by going through an under ground tunnel. More little gems like the underground mining track are sprinkled through the park. If you don't look around and just march through areas to get to a display, you are likely to miss most of the interesting aspects of Xcaret. Tips: 1) There are lockers that you can rent for cheap.2) You can rent snorkeling equipment for about $10. You can also rent towels. Be aware that these close at 5pm even though the park is open until 9pm.3) Make sure you catch the main show at 8pm. If you don't see this, it is said that you have not truly experienced Xcaret.4) Be sure to bring sunscreen and bug repellent."

We paid about $109 per person with a $20 rebate for each person. We took the 45 minute option; however, you can also choose the hour swim too which was about $159 per person. There is a shuttle that picks you up from the hotel. We arrived about two hours early. I felt the whole experience was rushed and the staff was not personable. We watched a 15 minute video of what not to do when swimming with the dolphins. Then, a staff member comes in after the video and explains the exact same information. When you're in the water, it feels like the experience is rushed. We had a total of seven people in our group (four of them were children). So naturally, the experience was geared more towards then (which I understand). The staff member will rush you to where you need to swim to next and when you need to pose for the next picture. Afterwards, someone will take you up to see the photos and video. We thought we could take a camera in to take our own picutres. That is not true. You will not be able to take a camera into the attraction. To purchase one photo, you'll pay $30 USD. We could have taken the package of all the photos and video (for two swimmers b/c you can also just buy the package for one swimmer). However, the package was $169! The gift shop was also underpar. I was looking forward to getting a gift for a friend there who loves dophins. What better place to buy a gift, right? No...there were some t-shirts for kids, stuffed animals, some necklaces and other small items in a corner of the store. I was really disappointed with the whole experience. We went with a family of four (husband, wife and two kids) who said they spent close to $1,000 on the whole experience including admission and photos. I was disappointed with the experience and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

I knew there was one attraction I absolutely wanted them to see and it was Xcaret.The park is phenomenal, when we first arrived we swam the underground river. From there we started touring the park which has so many things to see and do. From the massive aquarium, bird sanctuary, cemetery, jaguar and puma exhibit, the many restaurants, turtle area, beaches, coves to snorkel in, natural pools to swim in and much more. The end of the day is a spectacular performance in their massive open-air theatre which showcases the history of Mexico and the many different traditional music and dances from the different states through out the country, amazing.If there's one thing you do while in the area, do yourself a favour and go to Xcaret.It's cheaper if you purchase your own tickets on the internet before you go, if you purchase them three days or before you will get 10% off admission. Then if you are in Cozumel you can take the ferry over to Playa del Carmen and get a taxi to Xcaret. The last ferry going back to Cozumel departs at 10:00 pm so make sure you're back at the ferry terminal by 9:30 pm. If you are in Playa del Carmen just get your own taxi, we paid $13 USD one way. There are many taxi's waiting outside of Xcaret at the end of the day, you need to pay the person at the taxi booth for a ticket back to Playa del Carmen.Make sure to visit Xcaret, you will thank yourself for doing so."

Recently we have been getting the second-day half price deal, as one can't really see everything in one day. Leave extra time for finding your way around, as the trails can be confusing at first to navigate. We have enjoyed the swimming with the dolphins, and the underground river is a treat we look forward to on a hot day. The evening show is something to experience, and be sure to find a program that explains everything. There are many fun opportunities to learn about the floral and fauna of the region, as well as how Xcaret handles the park ecologically. Highly recommended."

            "review": "different but not as fun as expected. went here several weeks ago as part of our holiday to Cancun.Overall it was ok, there is a place called Xplore and Xel-Ha which are very similar to this place so I would recommend you do one but not all, we did Xel-Ha aswell as we went to Swim with Dolphins at the same venue, I believe Xcaret also do this trip. We booed a Xcaret plus trip which was advertised as use of lockers, snorkelling gear, buffet lunch and unlimited soft drinks. The locker and snorkelling gear is lcoated at the Xcaret plus area, quite easy to find. From here you get undressed for snorkelling in an underground area and put expensive items in the locker and keep the key with you. You also get a \"bag\" to put in towels, shoes etc that they take to the end of the underground snorkelling tour and its locked by you and you keep the key so nobody can get into it . We proceeded down to the underground start, its abit of a shambles and theres lots of people trying to get into a small \"river\" type area which you follow round and see loads of different things, theres several people taking pictures, please be warned part of the tour goes into REALLY dark caves, not good if, like me your are not great with the dark, me being about nervous in water also didnt help, butr you have several points inwhich you can get out if it gets to much. Once you get to the end you collect your bag and then can walk back to the start area of the other items in the locker, why they didnt just create the tour to start and end in the same place I did wonder but it was a nice thing to do, tiring though!After this we went and had lunch, went into the Mexican buffet, as we were told unlimited soft drinks I asked for a large lemonade, only to be told large couldnt be ordered and lemonade was not part of the deal!? I just had a small and I stress small coke, that was all we were allowed, no refills. Food was quite nice, go in early as it can get busy. after lunch we visited the beach and butterfly farm, we were given the option of staying for the evening show or go late afternoon, we decided to go early as we were tired and didnt want to pay for an evening meal to stay as the evening show did not end until 8pm time and being 2 hrs away we thought it was best to leave early.Overall its quite a nice place to go, was not happy at the \"unlimited soft drinks\" con, we had to buy drinks in the afternoon, we did the same all inclusive deal at Xel-ha and there they had a drinks area where you could help yourself, this is what Xcaret needed to really make it \"all inclusive\". Would I recommend you go-yes I think its worth a look, as mentioned above Xel-Ha is similar and Xplore which we did not do looks to offer the same kind of thing. I would recommend you go to one of them, I would prefer to go to Xel-Ha as its more catered for snorkelling however Xcaret does have a nice butterfly farm and has other things to see that doesnt involve getting wet whereas Xel-Ha is mainly being is water so its down to personal choice."

The big show that night was beyond our expectations. We also had dinner at the show and the food was absolutely delicious. We ate the mexican buffet and could not believe all the food provided on the buffet and so so very good. It gave us a good choice of the local mexican food in the region. The transportation to and from the resort was on time and the guide on the bus was very informative to us about the park before we arrived. Don't miss going to this and be sure and buy the Xcaret Plus package - it provides so much more than paying for each individual thing."

I booked a trip to Xcaret from the travel agent at the hotel I was staying at and got a good deal with out any rippoffs for Xcaret and Xplor. In my oppinion this is a must do while in Cancun. The park was pretty cool so expect to be there the whole day. We rented a car so we didnt have to pay for the tour bus down there and we were able to go and leave on our own time. Plus its a cool drive down there. Well about the park. We first got there and it was a gorgious park. The scennery there was awsome. We went snorkling through the cenote in the clear cool water. It was very nice. I have to say the most exciting part of it was snorkling through natural waters through the cenote. I think I saw only one fish swimming by me and it wasnt tropical looking at all. I just wish there were more natural fish in the water to see. Other than swimming and snorkling through the Cenote it wasnt all that. The rest of the park had a lot of good shows to see. There was the horses show and a native american ritual on top of a todum pole. The park was more to introduce tourist with the Mexican and Indiginous peoples coultures. Also, Xcaret had a lot of things to see such as a church with a cemetary on top, some Mayan Ruins, a tower that rotated 360 degrees up hundreds of feet in the air over looking the carribian, the deep forest, and also the entire park. It was a great view. Also in the beach area of the park was awsome. It seemned like a resort in its own right, As soon as we got to that area we decided to hang out there for a while and ended up taking a nap in the shade along the beach. Awsome!! At night there was the main attraction which made evey thing worth it. Just the show alone was well worth the money and the trip there. This show was a timeline of over 500 years of Mexico's history. The show started out with an awsome ceremony by the Mayans and continued to display a brief show of their lifestyles. It showed two different Mayan tribes comming together then organizing the infamous Mayan ball game. They played the ball game amazing us by how they were able to make the ball in the hole using their hips. The Mayan's played hockey with balls of fire. An AWSOME show. They also showed the comming of the European Spaniards and how they spread catholosism to the indiginous peoples. They showed the war between the settlers and the Mayans. Moreover, the show continued with evolution of the Mexican culture, flokoriko, banda, Tejano culture, Marriachis, and also still some hints of Indiginous dances. It was a great peacefull natural park with a some great shows. Must see and do if you are in Cancun or Playa De Carmen!!"

I was on holiday with my sister, and lets say we are both ladies over 50 but loved every minute of our experience. Firstly we snorkeled for the first time in an underground river which was a challenge for my sister as she is not a strong swimmer but she felt safe as a life jacket and all the equipment is provided by Xcaret. Secondly we did a Sea Trek and for those who dont know what this is it's a walk along the sea bottom not with scuba gear but a very large helmet that is fitted for you with experienced divers guiding you every step of the way. Xcaret is an adventure park come zoo with a night show to boot! There are plenty of places to eat and drink with the full flavours of Mexico, take plenty of money as you will be tempted by all the shops that sell traditional Mexican arts, crafts food and drink. If you fancy it you can swim with the dolphins or just watch the show they put on, or just take it easy on the beach in a hammock. I could just go on and on about this p[lace but my advise is if you visit Cancun Mexico then book this as one of your trips it's worth every penny ."

            "review": "Beautiful park but be extremely mindful of the costs and what it involves. Going to Xcaret can be a unique experience. All the attractions seem to be \"out of this world\". This place is awsome, but only if you haven't got a limited budget! It is outrageously expensive!It is expensive to get in (around US$99) with a discount from the hotel (more expensive at the door). Once you are in there are several attractions that are included which were all nice such as the underground river, that was fantastic! Unfortunately, We did not have sufficient time to see much more as we got to the park at 11.15am, swan with dolphins (extra), went for lunch, went to see some animals (turtles, tigers, black panther, deers, aquarium, etc), went on the underground river and by the time we finished we had to return the snorkling equipment and get ourselves dried and ready for the 7.30pm show. I wish we had had more time to see the butterflies, spend time in the water with inflatable rings, etc.If you are planning to go to Xcaret, it is worth paying a bit extra to get all the equipment (snorkling, flippers, life jacket, towel, locker, etc) and very important: lunch. The restaurants are all nice and the food was just LOVELY 10/10! Fantastic restaurants with a wide range of food!Now, I would like to take the time to tell you about the minuses so you can be very mindful before you make any decisions:1) Transport: you can have a coach to collect you from the hotel. The journey from the turist area where all the hotels are is 1 hr only. Unfortunately, we were the first one to be collected and we spent an additional 2 hrs collecting other visitors from their respective hotels. We were never warned about this. We were collected at 8am and we got to the park at 11.15am! The cost of the transport is around US$15 per person but some companies that sell the excursion don't charge for the transport.If you don't mind wasting 2 valuable hours inside the coach collecting people fine. If you do and there are a few of you it is worth paying a taxi (around US$50 each way) or hiring a car which may cost you US$35 for the day but bear in mind the car park in Xcaret costs around US$40 for the day! 2) Activities: when you decide to pay for an additional activity (ie swimming with dolphins), which in my opinion are very expensive, don't believe in everything they say. We wanted to swim with dolphins. We were told by the guys who sold our tickets to get into Xcaret that for every paying adult a child goes free to go swimming the dolphis. This was not true.Don't go by what it says in the leaflet either, some pieces of information are dated and they only tell you after you've paid! And refunds are not given very easily! Can you believe it? And that's the way it is. They would not get away with it being in the UK or USA!To go swimming with dolphins we had to pay an extra amount of US$99 each with \"the\" discount. The leaflet read \"1 hr 5 mins\". After we paid we were told it was half hour only because the leaflet needed updating and the US$99 ticket did not include what seemed to be the most attractive activities of this attraction: foot push, etc. And that if we wanted that we would have to pay an additional US$49 each. After we strongly complained they reduced this cost to US$30 per person. We so badly wanted to do it that we paid!The whole thing was FANTASTIC, AWESOME, UNIQUE but it only lasted 40 mins!3) Video/photos: If you have lots of money to spend on photos and video GO FOR IT! if not, DON'T even bother looking at them. Each photo cost US$25 (digital -not printed) and a \"15 mins\" video costs US$59.95. In my opinion simply a \"rip off\".We ended up buying the video to find out that when we got home it was only 9 mins long (with perhaps 1 min of promotional images) and that most of the lovely things we did in the water with the dolphins were not in there! I presume it's an strategy to make you buy some pictures as well!I made a very nasty complain to the Customer Relations Department as I got back to London and I have to say they were very good. They responded very quickly and admitted their errors and in compensation I'm getting part of the money back and to make up for the short duration of the video we are also getting all the pictures for free!Hope this information helps you when you go there!"

            "review": "Xcaret is beautiful BUT not for a full day. We have travelled to Cancun many times. When we travel, we very seldom visit this type of attraction. We prefer to do our own thing. After hearing from several guests at our hotel (Palace Resorts LeBlanc) that this was \"not to be missed\", we reluctantly decided we should try it. ALL the hotels have the \"full day\" package leaving at the crack of dawn and returning long after dark. Of course, their incentive is that you not miss a thing including the dinner show at night.We were primarily interested in the underground rivers and the beach. Anything else would be lagniappe. We knew we could accomplish this in a few hours and return to the hotel in the afternoon. Therefore, we agreed to use \"bonus dollars\" from the hotel to book a car to pick us up at 4:30, at considerable cost.After completing the underground river exploration, we were exhausted and headed to the beach. It's a beach but not on the ocean. They have created several lagoons for swimming, nothing over your head. We sat for a few minutes and left.We were ready to go back to the hotel at 1 pm., ended up canceling the car and taking a taxi.Now a caveat. It is a beautiful attraction, very well laid out and great for kids. The food was excellent. I wish I could remember the restaurant where we had lunch. It was beautiful, had a buffet chocked full of delectable treats.Keep in mind we were there in July....HOT, HOT, HOT! It is a lot of walking and even the underground rivers take a lot of energy. ABSOLUTELY take the fins even if you don't take the snorkel. My husband did not take fins; I ended up giving him one of mine. It can also be claustrophobic in the caves. Most of the caves do not go on for long distances but a couple do.All in all, it is well done. However, I cannot even imagine staying there for 10-12 hours, especially with children."

We started with a tour of the property seeing all kinds of wonderfull things, Mexican ruins, Jaguar Island, the Mexican cemetry and House of Whispers which was so cool. We then did the river I did not think I would do it but it was so hot it was a great way to cool off, It does take a while about an hour but a good way to cool off. Look out half way through when you look up you will see this amazing stained glass full of butterflies.Then it was onto the buffet a great array of delights, kept going up for more :)We saw a great display of Mayan culture that was acted out that we kind of just stumbled upon It was in the Mayan village they also had some lovely crafts that you could purchase.We did some more touring of the property and before we knew it, it was show time well worth staying for we only did the first half only because we were so tired.We had seen packages for Xcaret all over town but we decided to do it on our own the taxi from Playa del Carmen was $15 and we got the package at the door this way we could go and leave when we wanted to.I would highly recomend going here even if you had to pick just one thing to do as it showed a little bit of every aspect of natural and cultural richness of Mexico :)"

            "review": "Wonderful Experience. There are 4 dolphin experience programs from this company, one in Cancun and the others in the Maya Riviera. This company appears to take good care of their animals. A very high percentage of their animals are now bred in captivity as they have been in business for 20 years. The trainers seem very dedicated. This company participates in a theraputic dolphin encounter program for disabled adults and children. As a dolphin encounter experience it is a great way to meet the animals. Participants are divided into small groups-some with only 4 people and spend 50 minutes in the water with the trainer and the dolphins. There is plenty of time having the dolphins swim around the participants just for petting and interaction and they do react differently to different people. This program feels very personal and is run very smoothly from the participants point of view. Those not participating can watch family members from a viewing platform. They try to put those with family spectators closest to the viewing platform so everyone feels a part of the experience. There are lockers and towels provided. At the end of the program, participants watch a video of themselves with the dolphins as well as have the opportunity to purchase photos. Personally, I thought the photos and video overpriced but many people did buy them. I would highly recommend this attraction for everyone including children over the age of 7."

I strongly recommend this online because the lines are very long. You should plan ahead and get an idea of what you want to do before you get there. The park is huge and it is not so easy to navigate around. To do the snorkeling tour, you have to get your gear first, which is not located at the entrance. Also, do not bring your camera unless it is waterproof. There are bags provided that will transport your belongings while snorkeling, however the park is not held responsible if your camera breaks, like ours did.I'm not trying to be negative, this place was great! You need at least one day to spend here. The staff are friendly and bilingual, of course. I don't remember where my husband and I ate, but the food was really good."

There's swimming in place and petting the dolphin, (several opportunities), dolphin giving you a kiss on the cheek, dolphin putting her snout in your hand, dancing with the dolphin (5 secs), two dolphins propelling you along the pool with their snout on your soles, two dolphins jumping over your head, and some dolphin facts (fascinating). After 45 mins, \"time's up, thank you for coming, please check out your pictures and videos at the center before you leave\" (center is strategically located, impossible to avoid). Photos are ridiculously expensive!"

            "review": "expensive, felt ripped off by photos. Went to the Primax dolphin experience on my birthday. The experience was great if a liitle bit clinical. No cameras are allowed so you are reliant on the attractions photographers. Having paid nearly \u00a3300 for the experience to then be quoted \u00a3200 for the photos was a disgrace. There was no flexibility the girl said we could buy one photo for $25 so though we would do that. Chose a phto with all three of us in to be told we couldnt buy that one could only buy the photos of us individually in poses. It would have made no difference to them but they were trying to get us to buy the whole set. A rip off which ruined the trip"

Came as part of a package in our hotel, so we only spent a day, but it was colourful, fascinating and tiring. Have been recommending to friends and relatives ever since!"

A couple of things could be improved: the life jackets for the underground river swim are nit comfortable and also it would be nice to not see any junk food sold at such a place."

Beware of ALL-included where you'll barely use 50%.Don't go to the cenote-river floating first thing in the morning: everybody does it and it is worse than the subway at peak hours. DO go at lunch time (3pm in Mexico) or after and enjoy a peaceful ride.We would go again."

We booked the Primax tour, if you are hemming and hawing over which tour to choose, the foot push was my favorite activity with the dolphins. Now for the negatives, the grouping should have been organized better. We were picked up with another couple at our hotel who we got to know on the ride over and when it came to making groups we were standing with them. The guide asked who spoke English and who spoke Spanish and split us up so both of our tour guides had to first speak in English, then Spanish. The only other complaint was the price of the pictures. The cost of the CD and photos was the more than an entrance ticket of course I got both, because I swam with dolphins on my honeymoon and that doesn't happen everyday."

Xcaret tricks the tourist inyo going under the facade of a wannabe disney attraction, overpriced, lacks organization and extremely doubtful caring for animals and people.the manatee swim in circles in 3 meter pools and not well cared. they have a glass table of birds hatching with everyone tapping on the glass, guacamayas for picture in apparent bad shape. The staff is far from nice, which only makes me wonder if mexicans are so nice and these are mean, and animals are uncared for, is it coincidence.PLEASE DON'T GO!!!!"

During the day you can visiti all the water attractions and at night they have a play about the Mexican history and culture, it's nice."

I would recommend doing that and not in a large group. We both loved it and would go again and again!!There is only one thing we paid an $109.00 to get the cd with the pictures on it and to get it home and see it was all scratched up. When I took the cd in to get copies they were not sure the pictures would come out. They did and they turned out great. So if you do get a cd I would check it out before you leave to see how it looks."

The underground river is pretty fun, although years ago it had more of a moving current. The food is very good. The park is spread out and this time of year, it wasn't crowded at all. It was a Wednesday. They now have snorkeling tours and deep diving tours. They probably did this because the coral reef at Xcaret has basically been destroyed from all of the tourists and it is oily looking from all of the suntan lotion users. Years ago, they forbid lotion. The shows are nice, the animals are nice. A fun day for families with small kids and bigger children, as well. Worth the 45 minute drive from Cancun. Absolutely beautiful gift shop/snack shop."

            "review": "Most amazing experience of my life!. Spending an hour with a dolphin and her very kind and informative trainer was amazing. We did the $149 4 people to 1 dolphin ratio experience. AWESOME!!! The female trainer was perfect and spoke excellent English. (next time we go toMexico, we'll all be speaking Spanish. WHY did I take French in high school???)Fanny the dolphin swam near us, danced with us, gave a kiss on the cheek and jumped over us! She allowed us to touch her teeth and brushed up against us like a cat. When you look in a dolphin's eyes, you can see their intelligence. Their soul even perhaps? My only compaint is about the insanely high price of pictures. For one picture with a dolphin, it's $25. To buy the whole set of pics, it was $200, maybe even $250. Just too much! We ended up getting 2 pics for $50. I wish the price was more reasonable. Another snorkling excursion gave us a whole disk of over 50 pics for just $50. What a big difference.Xcaret would be amazing in good weather. We will definitely be returning to this park during our next visit to Mexico.Tips: wear water shoes, bring a camera. Get the Plus entrance s you have lockers, towels and snorkle equip available. Buffet restaurants were wonderful. If weather is iffy, bring rain ponchos or umbrellas!"

            "review": "Definitely not worth the money and they are militant about no cameras.. They picked us up at our hotel on time. We stopped for 4 other couples, took about an hour extra. Once we arrived we had to wait in line with about a million German tourists that all chain smoked cigarettes, no place to hide for non smokers with small children. It was at that point that I realized that I had gotten all of my kids stuff, but forgot my own suit. I asked the girl at the changing room if there was one I could borrow, she said no. I asked if there was one for purchase, she again said no. I asked if there was a lost and found one I could use. No no no.... so I went in my shorts. Whatever. We went through the people talking about what we should do and the such. We then were rushed out to the dolphin area, got into the water and went through a 31 minute presentation, which was fun but very rushed. Our guide (female, can't remember her name) rushed us through everything and was quite impatient with us when my kids were slightly afraid at the beginning. She was very short with my kids. After the presentation, we got dressed and went to see the pictures they took of us, which were fabulous. I hoped that they would have been, as they refused to let us anywhere near the dolphins with a camera of our own. We wanted to buy a few, and when we found out the price ($25.00 EACH) I was flabbergasted. I thought that maybe they would come in a little dolphin frame and be printed on nice paper, which made it easier to swallow. So I bit the bullet and got one picture of each of my kids. Yes, folks, $75.00 for three pictures. And guess what? No frame, no paper, nothing but a cd with pictures on it. I was pretty disgusted, and we left. I decided to forget about the whole experience as it was somewhat infuriating to me that we paid $500 for the tour and another $75 for 3 pictures on a cd. I was on vacation and I wasn't going to let it ruin my fun. Well yesterday I opened up my cd to send some pictures to my family. Guess what again? NO PICURES OF MY KIDS! Thats right the cd had lots of pictures of dolphins, and guides. But none of my family. I called the company as they have a toll free number. \"Sorry\" they said, no refunds. I told them I just want the pictures, but they delete them after a week. Here's my advice to you. Stay away from this tourist scam. The dolphins were great, but the people SUCK!"
