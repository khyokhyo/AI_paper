We went to the Palatine Hill after seeing the Colosseum which is probably the best way to do it, it was a refreshing change after the crowds in the Colosseum to be able to wander freely around the site and in the comparative quiet to imagine how the buildings must have been when they were newly built. The scale of the remains is immense and covers a large area but there is a lot of greenery and it is a relaxing place to wander around. There is also a museum on the site which is worth a visit. We were slightly unlucky the day we visited as it rained quite heavily for part of the time but it didn't spoil the visit and when the sun came out it was beautiful."

There are still remnants of tile floors and even colored walls left intact. Most of these homes are from the emporers or even the rich folks. There are lemon and lime trees lining the streets. You can also see below the hills the Roman Forum were the senate used to hold meetings. A must see."

Entry is included with Colosseum and Roman Forum so excellent value for money. If we had enough time I would have split these attractions over 2 days as the ticket allows you to do this. first tip - book online in advance. You will not escape the queues completely but it will help. At the moment it will cost you about 16 Euro. We had a voucher by e-mail that could be exchanged on the day of our visit (any time) by going to the reserved ticket desk at the forum. There was still a queue to get into the forum entrance as you went through security. It took us 20 minutes - I have been told since that if you go to the Palatine entrance further down the road you may get in quicker. It is very crowded at first, but thins out as you go round. The weather was wet, so spoiled our visit somewhat, as most of it is in the open. There is an excellent museum too with involving films"

I would also suggest going to the entrance near the Colosseum. No line up at all. We then walked through to the Roman Forum and did a loop and exited near the Colosseum where we went next.

Note that if you have this ticket you cannot enter the Forum and Palatine Hill on separate visits; you have to visit both at the same time. Once you leave you can't go back in. My friend made this mistake and missed out on Palatine Hill. I entered the site at the entrance adjacent to the Colosseum. There are loads of ruins and partially intact buildings with plenty of helpful info in english to help understand what you're looking at. The view over the Forum is wonderful and the area that is purportedly the original settlement of Rome, where Romulus lived, was something I wasn't expecting to see. Pretty cool to see where is all started several hundred years before the advent of Roman society."

The Palatine is quite an uphill walk if done in this sequence, but it wasn't too hot in early October. The views over the Forum were wonderful. We didn't have time to go into the structures within the Palatine, so can't comment on those.

Our advice - buy your ticket which covers you for the Coliseum, Fourm and Palatine Hill from the Palatine Hill or Forum ticket office. Queues are much much shorter than the Coliseum. Tickets are valid for two days and if you are under 25 and an EU national you can get in at a reduced rate ( take id such as driving licence). However, it seems that you do have to pay by debtit or credit card not cash. The Palatine Hill is an amazing venue of, what feels like, never ending roman artefacts and architecture. The views from the top are stunning. A place which seems to exude atmosphere."

Number one, up on top of the hill you get great views of the surrounding city. If for no other reason, go to the overlook of the Forum and beyond. Bring a guidebook to help explain each area you pass through and take your time."

We went early October, visiting the roman forum, palatine hill and the coliseum on the same day as you can purchase a ticket for all three, and palatine hill and the roman forum are within the same site. When getting your ticket and entering I strongly suggest going to the Palatine Hill entrance rather than the Roman Forum or Coliseum. When facing the Roman Forum entrance which is across from the Coliseums main entrance, Palatine Hill is to the left heading around the site. I guarantee the line will be much shorter and quicker. I would also recommend that if you don't have a guide, get an audio guide at the counter which is \u20ac5 from memory. Although most the ruins have information, there is so much more you can learn from the guide, even about the Emperors themselves. The only drawback from entering via Palatine Hill is you'll be listening to the audio guide's information in reverse order as it starts from Roman Forum, however I don't think this matters that much. If you really love your Roman history strap yourselves in for a long visit, we were there for 3 and a half hours and probably could've stayed even longer, there is a lot to see! The view from the top of Palatine Hill is especially good."

The two attractions are combined under one ticket. You can also buy a ticket combined with the Coliseum, but I had been there before so I did not. If the line across from the Coliseum is too long, walk around the block to another gate. Doing that decreased the wait for admittance from 45 minutes to under 5 minutes.Upon entrance, the best way to cover the area is to tour the Palatine Hill first, and then cover the Forum. That assures that most of your walk will be level or downhill. The stairway from the Palatine Hill to the Forum is long and steep; you don't want to climb it.You should be sure to take pictures of the Forum from the viewing area on the Palatine Hill. The views from up top are spectacular. Then head down and go to the Forum entrance to get the full experience.Be sure to bring a water bottle or cup with you. Numerous fountains are available where you can refill the water. The water in the fountains is safe to drink.Access to this attraction is easy from the Coliseum subway station. You should be careful around the station entrance. We inadvertently walked into the middle of a PLO protest. Fortunately it had full police coverage and was peaceful."

Be aware that you must leave a form of ID and therefore have to come back to the same place before you leave. We arrived at open, 8:30am. There were no queues. The staff were nonchalant, almost to the point of rude but that is quite common at the tourist attractions in Italy. The audio guide was quite informative but tricky to use at times. It's like a little mobile phone and the map is on a different screen to the attractions so you're always switching around. There were also some errors and things that didn't match up, particularly in the Palatine Hill part. Also, it has a loud speaker, you don't really hold it to your ear like a lot of other audio guides, so you really only need one between two people.

It is also the city's historical home, with tradition and archeological evidence placing Rome's oldest settlements here.Visiting Palatine Hill and the adjacent Forum was a breathtaking experience. It was impossible to imagine it as it was 2000 years ago, but moving to see it now in its state of disrepair. Perhaps there is something to the myth of Rome's founding, said to have occurred on this spot. The city's ancient roots are evident here, but it's spirit may reside amongst the ruins as well."

All around you are places where early Romans worked and played over 2000 years ago. While mythology holds that it was on this hill that Romulus and Remus were found and raised by the she-wolf Lupa, excavations show the hill was in use by bronze age residents over 1000 years before Rome's founding. Additionally tradition holds that the hill was named for an early Greek city Pallantium located on the hill.While the hill had a reasonable number of explanatory signs and maps, we made several unsuccessful attempts to find places overlooking the Circus Maximus. We were more successful in finding a view overlooking the Forum. As I mentioned in the title, it was a very hot day. The northern side of the hill was shaded and there was a vending area at which we could buy cold water."

Found a couple of city drinking water fountains, so bring an empty water bottle as there is no place to purchase food or beverages and you will need to hydrate.There is a bathroom near the garden area at the top of the hill. The buildings near the garden were under renovation when we visited = not even sure if they are open to the public if renovation is complete.You will notice the Fleur de Lis (French Cross) on some of the walls - interesting information on this shown in a film at the Palatine Museum. That film is about 15 minutes and is in English and Italian.View of the City, Colosseum, etc., is magnificent at the top of the hill. You will see a lot of lime trees there. Be sure to check out Augustus' house remains but budget the time for the Palatine Museum - it is incredible and educational. Would definitely make this entire area a go to place for sure."

You can do here, the forum and colosseum as part of one tour as they are all next to each other and take about 3 hours to view them all."

The views over the city are sensational as well. This is far better than the Coliseum which is next door. We used the archaeology card to avoid queueing for tickets although in fact there was no queue at the ticket office - only at the security check.Sadly although still good this is not anything like as wonderful as it was 20 years ago as the security procedures are intrusive."

We were advised to come to the Palatine Hill entrance to purchase our combined ticket to see this site, the Forum and the Coliseum, as the queues would be shorter, and that tip paid off after seeing the queues at the Coliseum (we only waited 15-20 minutes). We did intend to get the audio guide, but did not have our passports as security, so could not get this. Even so, we spent a great deal of time here and at the Forum (they flow from one to the other) and we were glad that we started at the top and worked our way down instead of having to go up at the end. The site was amazing, so interesting even without the guide, and such good value (12 euros) to see this site and the Coliseum. There is a small museum with a film show, which shows what the site would have looked like during Roman times - very good. We spent 2.5 hours here, stopped for lunch and then went to the Coliseum, another 1.5 hours, this time with an audio guide (did not need a passport for that one). Still had to queue to get through security - tip don't take water in with you, it is not allowed - take an empty bottle, you can fill it up in there."

Early morning would've been a little bit better but not by much. Just pick a better month to go than July.

This hill became the site of the Imperial Palace since it was the highest spot in Rome. Augustus, Tiberius, and Domitian all built there palaces here. It looks down on the Roman Forum on one side and the Circus Maximus on the other side. The ruins of the palaces are impressive in themselves. One of the most exciting discoveries was the discovery of the Lupercal cave. Because it is under the house of Augustus and partially collapsed, archeologists were only able to see mosaics in the grotto by scan. Even so, there is still so much to see and only one ticket is needed to see both Palatine Hill and the Forum."

We purchased a combined ticket (via the mobile site) with the Colosseum, and not only did we only have to wait just 5 minutes to get in there, but we saved on the price of entry for both sites! Couple this with the fact that the price of entry to the Palatine Hill alone would have been worth the visit, we were extremely pleased with the complete package! So much history, so much information and well presented. We were in Rome at Easter which meant one of the busiest times of the Roman Catholic year, but we were not rushed nor swamped by excessive numbers trying to get through the site. We would absolutely recommend this place for almost anyone except if you have serious mobility problems, in which case you will want to avoid it, sadly. Also make sure that you have plenty of water with you and have applied your suncream as its very open and exposed! (Even in April!!)"

I would highly suggest buying a collective ticket for entrance into Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum rather than buying on the day (go to the official ticketing website 'coopculture [dot] it' for your options). The line for entering these significant ancient grounds is long enough with a pre-bought ticket (with security scans being the main reason for delay into the site), so you can imagine how long it might take if you also need to line up to purchase a ticket as well!Many significant mythology stories are said to have happened on Palatine Hill, as well as the location of many historical moments in Rome's history. The ruins that you see as you walk through and explore the site will probably not mean much to the uninformed visitor as there are few detailed signs around the site, but if you are sincerely interested in what the remains of each ginormous building used to be, their purpose and significance, then there are audio and guidebooks that you are able to purchase to guide you through. While you only see what remains of a great and powerful ancient empire today, it is not hard to imagine how incredible Palatine Hill must've been at its peak and what a sight to behold it must have been. Palatine Hill together with the Roman Forum covers an enormous amount of ground, so make sure you bring water to keep fully hydrated, a hat and sunscreen to protect yourself from the sun and good walking shoes!"

My family and I visited the Palatine Hill as part of a Special Quality Tour combination guide package after our group tour from the Colosseum. After our first tour guide Fleurella or Flo was complete with our group, she transitioned us to meet our second tour guide Millichap, who is also a member of the Special Quality Rome Tours outside of the Colosseum in order to go into the Palatine Hill which is right across the street from the Arch of Constantine. During the Roman Empire's reign, many of Rome's most powerful and wealthiest citizens lived and worked on the Palatine Hill in sumptuous and luxurious estate properties and temples. There were about 15 royal families who fought amongst one other over land, resources, power, money and family members. The Palatine Hill overlooks much of the Roman Forum and Roman Senate House to the north side. The south side consists of house ruins, and a large courtyard. The ancient ruins of the Palatine Hill also overlook important surrounding structures of power such as the: Colosseum, Circus Maximus, the Imperial Forum, and Trajan's Market. The terrain of the Palatine Hill is mostly dirt and rocks, making it challenging (not impossible) for people in wheelchairs and babies in strollers travel throughout the hill. We also visited the Palatine Hill Museum, which displays many of the recovered artifacts from both the era of the Roman Empire and even a civilization dating back to 8th Century B.C. The Palatine Hill is also a major archaeological site for historians and it even have some works of art and sculptures finished by several artists on the south side of the Palatine Hill. The entire Palatine Hill and Colosseum guide by Special Quality Rome Tours was an amazing educational experience that strongly helps to understand the proper historical context of the Roman Empire"

It is a place to wander and reflect or take a guide-book or map and reference the different remains within it. The Palatine has a haunting quality - it is a place indifferent to the centuries and it makes your own life - your little pocket of time in this world - seem small indeed. You experience it and walk within it as you might within an ordinary park, but in this this uniquely historic park you will find the villa of Livia - the great Augustus's Empress who Robert Graves made so notorious in his novels I Claudius and Claudius the God. You have the vast sunken remains of Domitian's Stadium - an extraordinary sight in the fading late afternoon light; and the remains of Nero's Golden House. The Palatine is a place of beauty and mystery, not thrills and excitement; better suited to the contemplative traveller than the rubberneck or sensation-seeking tourist. I'm putting here the latest date I can, but the unchanging quality of the Palatine makes any review relevant - even an old one. And I have been there many times - both alone and as part of a couple."

Wear decent shoes, the ground can be uneven and there is a bit of a hill to climb if you want to see all of it.

I say that because you literally had historical figures bathe and lay their heads in that very spot. The grounds are maintained and the structures are as well as you could expect for the age.A special note I would throw out there is visit Palatine Hill first. Why?!?!Because your ticket will get you entry into the Colosseum. This means you skip the ticket que all together at the Colosseum and pay one low price instead of two. Huge time savor especially when your standing in long lines directly out in the sun."

A key tip is to purchase the tickets at the Palatine Hill entrance. We queued for only a few minutes rather than a wait time of 45 mins at the Forum.The Palatine Hill itself is well worth a visit and covers a surprisingly large area once you have walked up the gently sloping path. You get great views over the Forum itself plus other Roman Landmarks.The only downside I would currently flag is a series of modern sculptures which, quite candidly, add nothing and detract from the surroundings. I'm sure that others may have differing views given Art is always in the eye of the beholder but some are jarringly out of place (the best example being the word LOSER in eight foot high letters sitting in the middle of an otherwise impressive square thereby ruining what would otherwise be a decent photo!!)"

There is lots to see & its spread over a large area so please allow at least 2- 2.5 hrs to see the whole sight. There are some stunning views over the Roman Forum below along with some great ruins to look at of past Roman life & how & where they used to live.

Seeing the ruins and the Colosseum from a distance was just wonderful. I wasn't too impressed by the gardens but they were pretty (not super well kept), however, don't miss this beautiful area, if possible. We managed to get them both in before a crazy taxi ride back to our hotel to catch another ride to the train station! There was a concert that day and everyone was coming to the Colosseum as we were trying to leave the area. Trying to get a taxi was very difficult - we should have planned better upon leaving the area. Rich in history!"

After visiting the colosseum and having a colosseum/Palatine/Forum joint ticket, we walked up and over the Palatine Hill to get to the Forum. As it was a blisteringly hot August day, the breeze you feel up on the hill was a welcome relief! You'll need to use your imagination up here to visualise what anything is, I also used my Rome Rough Guide to explain what I was actually looking at. The small museum on the Palatine holds artefacts from the site and is worth a visit if you're up there (welcome air-conditioning too!). Make sure you find a suitable spot with great views over Rome and down onto the Forum to take some great photos. You won't need more than an hour on the Palatine but it is a great place to take in some picnic food and eat your lunch under the shade of a tree, taking relief from Rome's hustle and bustle for an hour."

Very impressive with some great views over modern Rome. Some modern art installations are scattered throughout the ruins. I like this juxtaposition of old and new and it makes an impressive setting for the artworks. However it is not everyone's cup of tea. Vast area with lots of walking so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. Very hot on the day we visited and plenty of water is essential. The colosseum, Palatine Hill and Forum are all next to each other and make for an amazing, historical, day's sightseeing. Not to be missed."

If not, book a tour with this company and use the promo code RICKSTEVES for a 10% discount. This was the best deal I found since we weren't able to get a tour through the official website (books up far in advance during summer months).Just be sure to bring lots of sunscreen (I'm not kidding-apply beforehand and bring it with you) and a water bottle for everyone.

What you might not know is that you can buy a combi ticket, where both palatine hill and colosseum is included. The price? 7.5 euro for students, 12 euro for adults and free entry for children 0-18. The ticket is valid for 2 consecutive days, but only one visit to each place. I did palatine hill the first day, and used probaby 5-6 hours to go through everything, it can surely be done quite alot faster, but there was so many amazing ruins and plaques with stories that kept me occupied for a long time. A hot tip, bring alot of water, there is water fountains inside palatine hill that people drink from, but these are crowded. I would recommend at least bringing 1.5L on a hot day. I cannot list everything inside palatine hill, because there is so much. I enjoyed palatine hill even more than I enjoyed colosseum."

You will be surrounded by ancient history and you'll have the opportunity to take some of the best shots of the Roman Forum and Circus Maximums. There are several entrances. One of them is near the Colosseum (you'll see a track going from Arco di Constantino) and the other is about 100 meters after the new metro line works site in Via del Fori Imperiali. Plan ahead because the archaeological site is huuuge and it'll take you hours to visit all the temples and ruins around this area. Usually not a good idea to go before or after the Colosseum since, like I said, it'll probably take most of the day to go all over it."

It was 32\u00b0 when we visited and we drank the free water like race horses. Water stops are scattered all over with plenty of shade for resting. Take a camera and if you are doing the audio tour take some comfy earphones with you as they will be in the entire time. It got a little crowed in the afternoon as most people visit the Colosseum first then head in here so be ready for plenty of people walking through your camera shots, it's completely manageable though and the place is absolutely massive so wear comfy shoes.

The site opens at 8.30am and at this time there are very few people around so you have the chance to get lots of photos with no other people \"photo bombing\" them. The site itself is absolutely amazing, you could easily spend a day wandering around here. The ticket for Palatine Hill 12e includes entrance to the Colosseum and Foro Romano as well."

Because it was the Beverly Hills of its ancient Roman times -- the elite tired quickly of NO AIR OR BREEZE down low in the streets, so sought the cooler heights. Hence, a) some great views, b) some great history, and c) a great, small museum recounting the past of the Palatine. We saved the museum for AFTER having already been down to the Forum, a nice move since the museum has AC!Too few people seem to know two tricks about going to the Palatine (as well as the Forum): 1) there is a third entrance to the Palatine/Forum, south of the one opposite the Colosseum, on Via di San Gregorio; and 2) if you go there early, like just when the attraction opens at 8:30 AM, you are likely to have the entire Palatine plateau to yourself and perhaps a handful of other tourists. We reached the beautiful belvedere overlooking the Forum WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE THERE. So my advice is: 3rd entrance AND Go Early. A third bit of advice: purchase your tickets for both the Colosseum and the Forum online BEFORE leaving on your trip. Just print out the forms and bring them with you. You can use them any time, but when you go to one (e.g. to the Forum/Palatine), you then will have to use the Colosseum entry by the next day at latest. We did the Palatine/Forum first, then the next morning were up early for the crazy scene at the Colosseum (for lining up, that is)."

I have been on this tour twice both morning and afternoon and didn't find much difference in the heat but the thought of going back to the hotel for a swim made us choose the morning tour."

There are many steps and stairs and ramps and nooks and crannies and it all ultimately leads to the Forum, and great views over the city and the Palatine ruins. It's a lot of walking but there's plenty of handy water fountains dotted around the site where you can refill your water bottles or take a drink for free.There is also a modern museum building on the site, featuring artefacts from ancient Rome we assume - we didn't go in as we were doing a speed-run of historical Rome that day, due to the short length of our stay.This is a great value ticket and one of the shortest queues we had to stand in in the whole time we were there; we would definitely return to this attraction and would recommend it to other travellers."

The site is large and has a number of small sites/museums you can spend time in. The ruins are extensive and amazing. Almost impossible to take a bad picture. Show up early if you can, especially during the summer/high seasons to reduce the crowds. When hot (30+ degrees), water is essential. There were no vendors inside the site that we saw. There were a few fountains if you have an empty bottle. Water would be a good idea, even when not hot. We'd skip the audio guide next time, as the numbers didn't sync with the map, so it was cumbersome and didn't add to our experience. Also, if you rent the audio you have to leave ID, which means you have to leave by the same gate you entered, cutting down your options. Plan to do the Coliseum right after (it is right there), unless the crowds are too big or you're two tired. The combined ticket works for the Coliseum if you buy it and is valid for two days, so you can come back the next day."

The place where Romulus built the city, the hill is the heart of the ancient city that ruled the Mediterranean world. an absolute must see! The palatine was the home of the Roman republican aristocracy and later the sight of the imperial palace. Make sure you buy a ticket online and print at home to avoid long lines, especially in summer. The ticket is combined with a visit to the forum, can be paired with colosseum as well. I recommend to first climb and explore the palatine and then slowly descend into the forum. There are a number of Terraces with spectacular views of the entire forum and colosseum. Take some lovely pics and descend in the forum, walk the Via Sacra and explore the many remains of temples and churches. The latest site is the Santa Maria Antiqua, an imperial atrium which later became one of he first Christian churches. Beautifully restored wth some amazing early frescoes. At the foot of the hill it is connected with the emperor's ramp leading to the palace on the palatine. Fascinating!Palatine now also features the restored villa of Augustus and Livia, but special arrangements need to be made to visit. Hot, Exclusive tip: If you want to avoid the massive lines under the hot Roman sun, use the palatine hill entrance on Via di San Gregorio, which runs between the colosseum and the circus maximus. There's barely any people entering from that side. Be smart!"

Also, it is from this word, Palatine, that we get the modern word, Palace. In Roman mythology, it is said that this is where Romulus and Remus were found by the she-wolf, Lupus, and kept alive. There is much rich history to this area, and should not be missed. Since there is a lot of walking to be done, it is best to go early in warmer weather."

When we were thirsty, we refilled our bottles from the public fountains dotting the hill. The water was cool, clean and potable, so that even our 3 year old son drank his fill without any effect. We splashed the cool water on our overheated limbs and the feeling was out of the world. And finally from the top of Palatine Hill, we looked down upon the ancient ruins of Roman Forum and were awestruck. All in all, we relived the lives of the ancient emperors of Rome and imagined it come alive beneath us. It was an experience out of the world. This is a must visit stop for any visitor to Rome, and I would like to see it again."

You really need a full day to walk the Forum, Palatine Hill and the Colosseum. One ticket for 14 euros covers all three and the difference between Palatine Hill and the Forum is seamless, but they are different. Palatine is worth it because you can look down on the Forum. On the other side of Palatine Hill you can look down on Circus Maximus. This hill is the birth place of the Romans! Inhabited since the 10th century BC. Rich folks and emperors of Rome lived here throughout Roman dominance. The ruins of Augustus' palace, emperor Tiberius' palace and Domitian are still visible! 27 BC - 96 AD. I mean really, just think about that! Crazy! This is the least crowded of the three sites on the Colosseum combo ticket."

Fairly long walk (1/2 + mile) , fairly steep and the vending machines at the top that sell water are problematical. When you get to the top you will see the private theater for the emperors, some attractive gardens(but certainly not spectacular). The views toward the Forum and ruins are quite interesting and make you wonder why someone didn't take it over as a private residence. Well worth the time and walk, but nothing spectacular."

Walk to the very top of the wall and look down onto the whole scene - it is a true old world wonder. One great thing: all over Rome (and most towns in Italy) you will find clean running water fountains to rinse your hands, fill your water bottle, and dunk your head on hot summer days. A life saver!"

Don't miss Palatine Museum while here, it has some amazing artefacts from AD and BC it really does blow your mind how old everything is.

And also where Romulus and Remus lived if you believe the legend.Thanks to the museum, and the partially reconstructed ornamental gardens on the Palatine, there is a lot more cover than on the Forum or Colosseum and drinking water taps appear regularly, so despite the climb it is a more comfortable visit on a hot day.Visited the Palatine on the same day as the Colosseum and Forum, and I would definitely say it is the best of the three."

Domitian's palace and some of the Flavian is also worth the walk and the views of the city below are pretty darned good ones. Exit for Gelato through Titus's Arch but do NOT miss the interior engravings there.

The Palatine Hill - located overlooking the Roman Forum, next to the Colosseum, and overlooking the Circus Maximus - is the most important of the seven hills of Rome, and the most ancient. The site is covered with excavated ruins and amazing vistas of the city. It is an area that is difficult to understand without a local guide - we tried that on a previous visit. This time we used a company, \"Through Eternity\", that specializes in small groups (8 participants) - they are terrific! Be warned, though, that this is a somewhat challenging tour due to the amount of walking and often uneven surfaces, but REALLY worthwhile."

We would have stayed longer that day but we had no food or drink with us, and although there are a couple of vending points and plenty of water spouts, we wanted a cafe break! So the next day we went again (forum, colosseum and palatine hill all one ticket) and paid for an audio guide also. We went prepared this time with take away sandwiches and refillable water bottles, and plenty of time. We headed straight into the Palatino area totally avoiding the Forum except to pick up our audio guide. The palatino area is a lot prettier, greener, than the Forum. The audio guide was brilliant for navigating our way around, a blue marker dot shows you where you are on the map, whist toilets, water spouts and points of interest are all instantly displayed at the touch of the screen. This all makes the visit a lot more enjoyable. The markers at listening posts all have numbers, so rather than going around in a particular order, we strolled around in a very leisurely fashion, listening at the corresponding post as we desired. The museum has an interesting array of antiquities, the most striking, are the wings of victory. The real breath taking moment for us was looking at Augustus's Palace, the sheer scale of the place needs to be seen to be believed. We managed to find a sheltered bench behind the palace where the hillside drops away , and you can view the remains of the aqueduct arches to enjoy our packed lunch, and while away some chill time to rejuvenate our weary legs!"

Roman myth holds that Romulus established Rome on the Palatino after he'd killed his twin Remus in a fit of anger. Archaeological evidence clearly can't prove this, but it has dated human habitation here to the 8th century BC.Enjoy after Colosseum the incredible history.

You do not get that feeling of walking in the footsteps of the Romans and the ability to visual their daily lives at Palatine Hill as you do at the other two sites. Still, being the site of the palaces of the emperors and other nobles of Roman society, it is worth seeing.One of the most exciting views is the view of the Circus Maximus that you get from Palatine Hill. Also seeing the emperor\u2019s private area for races, etc. was interesting.Most tours of the Forum also take you through the Palatine Hill sites, so why not go! I am glad we went, it just was not as exciting as the other two major Roman sites. Our tour was of all three sites and was through OverRome. The guide did an excellent job in explaining, giving enough information to keep the history buffs happy, but not overwhelming or boring those less interested in history. It was a good balance."

The views are incredible and the photo ops are more than plentiful. Going with a guide is important because the history and extra information they provide help in appreciating the site. Comfortable shoes are a must as the terrain and steps are uneven. On a hot day water is a must, too -- and you can refill it along the way. I felt badly for folks who were trying to navigate strollers -- hard to do here but if you have an extra set of hands that helps. Take a moment and sit - you might need to break and there is something special about gazing about this incredible lasting slice of history."

If doing self-guided tour, consider: 1) buy the 12\u20ac combo ticket at the Palatine Hill gate (walk past Constantine arch about 300 meters), 2) see Palatine Hill 1st & the Forum next (downhill walk from Palatine Hill to the Forum), 3) to avoid feeling beat, take a break and see the Colosseum later on or the next day (combo ticket good for two consecutive days), 4) use Rick Steve's free Audio Europe app for both the Forum and the Colosseum."

Rather than rebuilding or replacing the structures that time has taken, the respect of this area is shown in the uncovered pieces of history left as they have been found. The combination of practically perfectly intact structures with crumbled remains provides an opportunity to see the various layers of history and helps to understand how researchers have come to the conclusions they have about what has taken place over the centuries in Rome. As you exit the Palatine Hill area there is a small section of uncovered relics between the exit and a busy city street. According to our tour guide that area was uncovered when a pipe burst under the parking lot that had been there. As they were digging to reach the broken pipe they discovered more relics, immediately closing the parking lot forever, and carefully uncovering another layer of history! Just remarkable!"

As footing can be challenging in places (especially if it has just rained) the choice of footwear needs careful consideration. If you prefer, guided tours are avaialble outside but due to the number of groups inside and the size of the group you may strggle to hear everythng that is said.

If you are able to walk up the Hill (quite high but managable), I would highly recommend it. You get a good view over the surrounding areas and also get to view some of the Roman Forum for a different angle. There are water fountains within the area which enable you to fill up your water bottles for free, when it is hot it is well worth looking out for these!

A great area to explore and see the ruins of the old ancient city of Rome, without the crowd of the Colosseum; we had no plan of how to explore the area and went with the flow. We would have spent much longer at the Palatine had the weather been nicer and had the other-half\u2019s hayfever not got worse; we could have easily spent over two hours exploring the area. The Palatine Museum (Museo Palatino) is located on the hill and the entry is including within the ticket price; for those with a Roma Pass, it is part of the single entry for the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill. Note:If you plan to go the Colosseum, Roman Forman and Palatine Hills remember three things; i. Roman Forum and Palatine Hills count as one entry if using the Roma Pass, ii. if you get the combo ticket for all three sites it is valid for 2 days, and iii. do not get combo ticket from the Colosseum due to the much longer queue.We started at the Roman Forum and because we had a Roma Pass, did not need to queue (there was a queue of about 50 waiting to get tickets and a family of four in the reserved ticket queue); we went straight through to where the security guard is standing. If you need to purchase tickets, get them from the Palatine entrance, when we were leaving from the Palatine side, people were getting tickets without having to wait. When we went to the Colosseum, even with a Roma Pass we had to queue 30 minutes to get through the queue outside and go through all the security checks. If one does not have the Roma Pass or the combo ticket, the queue at the Colosseum for purchasing tickets was longer."

There are no cafes but you can refill your water bottle from the drinking fountains. There are also some public restrooms in the area. In my opinion this place is even better than the Colosseo. Don't miss the Aqua Claudia as it is a must see."

The place is breath taking, and the scale of the Palace must have been unbelievable back in the day. Here along with the Roman Forum was probably the highlight of our trip, and I'm 100% heading back here again the future. I have a feeling that due to the scale of the site there are still things we did not see or explore. A highly recommend day out - and you will need a full day to see The Colosseum, here and The Forum."

They are right next to each other, so there's not much of a walk at all. Palatine Hill does require a lot of walking, though, but it is worth it.

The Parthenon and Knossos paled and seemed like mere piles of rubble by comparison. I so hoped that Rome would not seem like that to me. I need not have worried.Having wandered around the Forum my wife and I wandered up on to the Palatine Hill - all on the same ticket and essentially the same site - and I honestly had the best day of my life that day.I am not sure if there is any place on earth which has a view that contains so many historical landmarks in such a compact area. Every iconic monument you point your camera at has another equally significant one peering over its shoulder. And the site is so vast that the crowds get lost in there. Unlike the Colosseum where you have to wait for a tour group to go past to get a free shot at your point of interest all you have to do is turn around and look at something else for a bit. You can see so much from a single point that it is hard to know how to focus.I cannot do this place justice, just go there for yourselves.The entrance fee is about 12 euros and that ticket covers the Palatine, Forum and Colosseum and is valid for 2 days - London are you listening? You can buy them on the day or in advance. You can get tours and guides but I honestly think there is less need than for the Colossuem. If you take a tour with a guide you will probably need to come back again and go around more slowly and drink the place in - I found the same to be true of Pompeii. It is great to have the information but you need time to absorb the scale and atmosphere of the place."

The Palatine hill is a place where can spend hours taking in the history and the awe inspiring architecture that remains of what might have been an impressive palatial complex. It is important that you wear comfortable shoes, bring water and snacks, since the grounds are quite extensive and there is a lot to see: from the Flavian palace overlooking the Forum, the Domus Augustana, and, most importantly in my opinion, the Palatine Museum located at the top of the hill. If you are into the history of western civilizations, you may find yourself spending over 4 hours enjoying everything there is to see in this place. If you have kids, 2 hours may be over the top for them. I highly suggest visiting the museum: in it you'll find artifacts found on that same hill dating back to the bronze age, and forward in time to the iron age, the kingdom, the republic, and the empire. It is believed settlements on the Palatine hill date back to 10,000 BC\u2026it could very be the hill where it all began for Rome."

Otherwise the complex may look like every other pile of ruins in Italy. This was the center of Roman life, and the buildings are from several different eras. This was not our first visit, but given that we had not been here in several years we opted for a tour as a refresher. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable (an archaeological professional) who had many human interest stories that brought the site to life.Second, be aware that the site requires many steps and walking over uneven ground. Last, note that in summer , a visit in the middle of the day will be very warm. Bring sunscreen a hat and water."

When I returned it later, the staff person was very rude, effectively accused me of lying and refused to return my money! The interpretation was minimal. When you walk in, you have no idea where anything is, no clear idea of the overall layout or sense of the place as a cohesive whole.You wander around stumbling on different ruins and not really understanding each one's place in the history of the Roman era. Signage needs to be vastly improved. Paths need repairing and the whole area feels like it needs much more money spent on it, considering its major historical significance. There are no staff visible on the site so no-one to ask where anything is or the what/why/who etc of any of the ruins.Often other heritage sites have staff or volunteers around just waiting to help. There was nothing like this. So overall, I'm glad I visited the Palatine Hill but I think it is huge opportunity missed to make it a top visitor attraction for Italy, not just Rome."

There is even a fine photo opp of the dome of St Peter's in the far distance, framed by the ruins on the hill. It is even possible to visit the so-called remains of the cabin of Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. At the very least, that foundation represents some of the earliest evidence of human habitation in the area.

In retrospect, the Colosseum is much more impressive but i wouldn't have wanted to miss this either because it is believed that Julius Cesar is burried here and that is just one of the impressive locations. The Foro Romano is also very impressive. The Green Door was at first a Senate, then it became a church and after a Senate again which explains the immaculate state its in. All together very nice and a must on your to-do list."

There are some lovely form up high over Rome. It would be very hot in high summer but we wouldn't visit then anyway and late April was perfect for us with some sunshine and some showers but being British we are used to site seeing in the rain and it didn't detract from the visit. The rain didn't last long anyway. We pre booked the entrance ticket on line which included the Colosseum, Forum and Palentine Hill, from the official website. This lasts several weeks and doesn't tie you to a set time of day or date which allows for greater flexibility whilst site seeing."

We had no idea how wonderful it was going to be and how much there was to see, We walked for three hours and in the end were too tired to spend any longer. The site is massive. The walk on the Palatine hill gives stunning views and truly amazing architectural gems. We didn't have a guide or an Audi guide but there was enough information on the panels ( helpfully dual Italian and English) for us to understand something of what we were seeing.. The tickets last for two days and include the coliseum which we didn't have time to visit this time and it really does need two days I would say. I recommend taking at the very least a bottle of water with you. There are machines to buy this, but we had walked for two hours before we found one."

Make sure you wander all around. There is a great view of the entire Circus Maximus from the back of the Hill. If you look off to the left you an also see the baths of Caracala. You get a real sense of what Roman life was like and how beautiful it would have been. On the flip side, you also get a real idea of the differences between the classes and how they lived. Our 10 year old has visited a few times with us and also says it is his favorite place. He gets to run around, take photos on his own and play amongst the ruins."

The Colosseum ticket includes the entry to this place along with Roman Forums. Also if you have a Roma pass you can access this place without buying a separate ticket. We went with our little one (12 months) with a stroller. But we had difficulty in pushing the stroller as the paths in the hill are not stroller friendly. So I would advice carry your baby with a carrier or sling or a baby backpack carrier. In fact entire Rome was not very stroller friendly, but we managed. Without stroller as you roam around the city entire day its difficult for the baby during nap time. So we had to carry the stroller around."

There are a few shady areas, but if you are going in the heat of summer it is going to be very very hot.We discovered a very convenient (unsignposted) w.c. adjacent to the Rose Garden which was a relief in many ways. One thing we learned on the tourist trail was that if you see a loo without a queue, then use it!Now I\u2019m going to say a few words about being a tourist in Rome, and I will include it with reviews of all the places we visited because I wish I had known prior to my visit and maybe it will help you on yours!Firstly, Rome is an elegant city. Tourists in shorts, crop-tops and mini-skirts stand out like a very sore thumb. This attire will mean you are unwelcome in churches, (especially the Vatican and the Vatican Museums) where it is regarded as disrespectful. Expect to be turned away if you are dressed like this. We witnessed from one lady in microshorts and a strappy top and her partner in vest top, Bermudas and tattoos, being politely asked to cover up or leave St Peter\u2019s which did not go down well after waiting for hours in a queue.If you dress smartly you are less likely to be bothered by hawkers, tables materialise in apparently packed restaurants, and you are treated with respect. It\u2019s worth going for \u2018smart casual\u2019 if you want to get the best from Rome.Secondly, footwear. Roman streets are mainly cobbled and very gappy. Stiletto or kitten heels are going to be mighty uncomfortable. Wear block heels, wedges or flat shoes and you won\u2019t go far wrong. Most Roman ladies seem to run around in loafers or boots. Another thing to consider is that there is A LOT of walking involved wherever you go. Walk your shoes in thoroughly before you get there and you will save yourself a lot of pain and blisters. Nevertheless, it might be a good idea to pack some plasters in your handbag so you don\u2019t limp yourself out of action. I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019m the first person to lose a toenail after three days walking around the city.Be polite, smile, say hello, please and thank you in Italian and you will be appreciated as much as you appreciate the Eternal City."

Throughout our walk, we were just in awe because the same cobblestone that we were walking on was also where the Roman emperors were walking about 2000 years ago, I thought that its very impressive. Expect to see a lot of artifacts, expect the sun (it can really burn you. I'm tan/light brown and I got burned), and expect walking long distances. Make sure to go to the gardens and enjoy the view (of the gardens and also the view of the city since the gardens are on a higher elevation). I highly recommend."

The hill and the forum are in the same area, so once in, you can't come back. I highly recommend booking some sort of tour, as there is so much to see, but it won't make any sense without someone telling you what you are looking at. I downloaded the Rick Steve's audio tour, which was good, but there was still so much more to the attraction that wasn't on the audio tour. (This is free though). I do not understand how people said that they walked through in 5 minutes. There is a whole part of the area that many people simply don't go to, up on the hills. We toured the area for a little over 2.5 hours and still didn't see everything. I can imagine that it's extremely crowded during the summer months, so just keep that in mind. I went in April so the air was cool and the crowds weren't too bad. Also, there are multiple entrances to this. Go to the one to the left of the Arch/ Colosseum, no one knows about it and there is hardly a line there. Everyone only knows about the other two entrances and you will wait forever in line to buy your ticket, then again to get through security. (Again, if you bought your ticket for the Colosseum, then you only have to wait in the security line). I do not recommend this activity if you have trouble walking or have little children."

You can stand where the emperor sat when he ruled the world. It has better feel of ancient Rome than the Forum. There is also a great view of Circus Maximus. Get your tickets in advance!!!! The ticket covers the Coliseum, the Forum and Palatine Hill. A guide makes it easier to understand and although more expensive a private guide for a couple is very enjoyable."

Roman Forum + Palatine Hill and Colosseum are usually sold in a 2 day ticket so if you opted for these tickets, come only to the Hill after the Colloseum as it is a huge area and queues are less. There are so much to see and each angle offers a different perspective. If you are financially able, book a guide with reputable company instead of just walking around sightseeing as you will apprecate the place better. I enjoyed my visit here and it is suitable for long walks with family."

The Museum has some excellent exhibits, and should not be missed. The houses of Augustus and Livia were particularly interesting, compared to the palaces of the later Emporers.

As it was the second place I went to after getting my Roma Pass I was able to walk straight in without any queue for tickets either. The Palatine Hill is part of the same area and you can just walk between the two. This entire area I absolutely loved. So many different parts and things to see. I spent hours here. Even on a boiling, busy afternoon there were areas that were quiet and peaceful. It was hard to believe you were in the middle of Rome!I'm so glad I came here by myself and NOT as part of a tour for my first visit. I just had all the time I wanted to explore and appreciate things. There's no way I would have had such a wonderful experience on a tour, even with a good one. I actually came back for a second visit with a tour, which was interesting and I learnt more about the areas, but it didn't compare to my first solo visit. There are toilets around and drinks machines, although I'd suggest just filling up a bottle with water from the free drinking fountains that are around. You could easily spend a LOT of time here so take comfortable shoes! I can't recommend this place highly enough."

Brilliant insight into what Rome was like and the architecture with great views across the Forum area from the hill look out.The palatine Museum is worth visiting so make sure you go there and don't be put off by how crowded the lower section is the first floor was less crowded. Both screening rooms were full and there were people standing so perhaps it is about time some of the income was invested in extra tiered seating or a new screening room set up. We then explored the Forum area and returned to the entry gate only to be told the exit was behind the church with a hand indicating the direction by the lady stopping us trying to leave via the entrance through the partially open gate. No - that sent us to a dead end so back to the lady who then showed us where the exit was. Maybe you should get a map as part of your entry fee or there should be more/bigger signs.Quite windy so there was a lot of dust blowing around."

One of the things we found so fascinating was all the different levels you pass through as you climb up the hill and then look out towards the circus massimo.One word of warning (other than making sure you give it the time it deserves): the paths (even the non cobbled ones) can be very uneven.

However there is just so much to see that we needed to go back on our own and spend more time exploring. Take a guide book with you as the signage is not the best. The scale of the site, like most of Romes splenders, is awe inspiring. Take your time and a bottle of water!"

We decided to visit The Colosseum on the morning of March 8th followed by The Palatine Hill. We had two pieces of good luck, the first being that March 8th is International Women's Day which means that ladies can enter all attractions free. The second was that the Colosseum ticket -- a mere 16 euros -- includes your entry to The Palatine Hill.Having spent a couple of hours or so in The Colosseum, which I have written about in a previous review, we strolled across to The Palatine Hill and Forum. As you would expect, a unique atmosphere pervades this amazing place. Was I standing on the same ground as Julius Caesar and Cicero ? Other names like Augustus, Marc Antony, Tiberius and even Nero occurred to me. Phrases like \"The Cradle of Civilisation\" and \"Birth of a Nation\" floated through my mind. It was especially poignant for me who had studied Latin at school and had read about this place many times.We spent about three hours on this historic site that has been the inspiration for thousands of books, plays and films. My advice for visitors to Rome is to get up a bit earlier than usual, go to The Colosseum in the morning and then, perhaps after lunch, walk across to The Palatine Hill and Forum. This will be a very special day as these are two \"must see\" attractions.I have taken the liberty of reading other Palatine Hill/Forum reviews, especially the poor ones. How anyone can write a poor review of these places is beyond my comprehension. What are they expecting: glass, plastic and flashing neon lights ? Ignore bad reviews and follow my advice -- you will not be disappointed."

Things you should know.not a lot of pick pocketing in this area if you're careful .you can buy water and snacks .THIS APPLYS IN THE COLOSSEUM AS WELL. IF YOU BUY ONLINE TICKETS (which I recccomend) PRINT THE VOUCHER OUT OR THEY WOLNT LET YOU IN OR DO TOURS AND THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF PLACES TO PRINT, TRUST ME !.Busy but not terrible .BE THERE EARLY IF YOU WANT TO GET IN ( the line can get bad)."

This part requires a decent level of fitness and flat shoes in order to appreciate and enjoy the views.. Once you have finished viewing the excavation on the top of the hill, you move to the views where you overlook the Forum. Not only does this take you breadth away by the vastness of the layout, you are surprised at how high you really are looking down onto old Rome. There is still excavations being undertaken at this site, so it is not unusual to see people in overalls with hardhats/lamps walking out of the ruins.An excellent attraction"

It's a beautiful and really well preserved place which offers a lot of things about life back then to see. ATTENTION: If you visit it right after the Colosseum, like we did, make sure that you don't go through the entrance that is right next to the Colosseum cause there is a really big line in order to get in. We waited for 30-40'. If you walk a bit round it (i.e. if you take the road that it's on the Roman Forum's right and head to the Piazza Venezia) you can find another entrance to the area, that is smaller and has significantly smaller line."

What a con-trick - although we had tickets for the Palatine Hills, and joined a smallish queue (about 15 metres long) it took one and a half hours to get in! This was for three reasons: (i) Groups had precedence, so they were overwhelming the security system; (ii) Some people were pushing in; (iii) the security process was airport-style and took forever. Now I'm happy to go through security checks, but the system used in the Colosseum was just two guards using a metal-detector wand and looking in some of the bigger bags, so it was much quicker.Anyway, after all that, we were quite tired of standing around, so the walk around the Palatine Hills and Forum was inevitably cut short, although what we did see was very interesting.I would recommend: a) Joining a group tour; b) Going early in the day; c) Don't take young children as they will get very bored!"

The Palatine hills area is fantastic I didn't know what to expect but it was full of history walking in the steps of the Romans and views from the top were great across Rome and Colosseum. March was a nice time to visit less crowds and plenty of time to walk about the ruins we were very lucky with weather blue sky's and warm for March.

This time we had done our research, the weather was better and we covered parts that we hadn't seen previously or identified on our earlier visit. We started at the entrance near the Colosseum, walking past the Aqua Claudius to the remains of the Palaces of Domitian, Septimus Severus and Augustus, including part of his garden. It is also the best place for a view of Circus Maximus which is quite disappointing from ground level. A highlight is the Palatine Museum which house many artifacts, including frescos from Nero's Golden House. We didn't take a tour as most areas are well sign posted and this just built on our pre-reading."

The ruins on the hill are in better shape than the Forum below, but it's all really incredible.

It's \u20ac12 for a ticket, including entrance to the Colosseum and it gives you two days to visit both. Absolutely not to be missed.The major problem we encountered was that that unlike most big attractions they wont let you go out to get food and then come back inside after lunch. There's no food inside - just a few vending machines and some water fountains - so you have to either take food in with you or restrict yourself to a short visit. I imagine this would be particularly problematic for people with children. Having said that, they wont let you in with big rucksacks either so taking a picnic might be a bit tricky too.We visited in February so the weather was mild and dry which is definitely the best sort of weather to visit in if possible. It wound't be much fun in the rain and I suspect that in the summer it is fairly unbearable because there's very little shade. The Palatine Hill entrance on Via di San Gregorio is probably the shortest of the three queues but we'd recommend buying a ticket online or using the Roma Pass to jump the queues, especially at peak times. Make sure you have some sort of guide (there's tour guides and audio guides available, but we used a book to guide us round which was quite suitable for what we wanted) because there are very few signs or information boards to tell you what you are looking at.Overall an incredible visit and one of the most enjoyable parts of our stay in Rome. So long as you're prepared for the lack of food and information boards you cant fail to enjoy and we would recommend to everyone."

The pines! The pines of Rome! They are so incredibly beautiful. We didn't purchase a guide to the area, just followed along with the page or two in our guide to Rome, but that was fine for us. It was part of one of our nicest days in Rome. We spent all morning here and in the Roman Forum, had lunch, went to the Colosseum, and then went to a small museum after that. All of the activities were paid for together on the Archeology card, and it was fantastic."

We heard about the long lines and how you can spend a lot of time waiting so we booked a Colosseum Tour with Special Access to Underground & Arena Floor through Expedia. The tour was conducted by City Wonders and the whole tour was AWESOME!!! It started with a guided tour of the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill and ended with an incredible tour of the Colosseum. This tour allowed us to bypass all of the lines tied to all three of these sites and our guide gave us a very comprehensive tour of each site and provided us with so much incredible back story to really help our group really understand what we were seeing. It's easy to kind of lump Palatine Hill in with the Roman Forum as they're very close to each other. If I had to vote for which I like more, I'd vote for the Forum but Palatine Hill is a site worth visiting too. The ruins there aren't as complete as they are at the Forum, but definitely worth the visit. The guide that accompanied us throughout our tour was awesome and really helped bring it all to life for us. So much better than an average audio tour. The entire tour (Roman Forum/Palatine Hill/Colosseum) was awesome! I'm so glad we paid the extra money for that very unique and enjoyable experience and would recommend others to do the same."

I have since been to Rome on two more occasions and this is my absolute favorite place. To see and actually TOUCH things from 495 BC is almost unbelievable! Prior to my most recent visit I did my homework to learn all I could about each ruin. I spent two days here and could have spent more. You will absolutely want to wear comfortable shoes with non slip bottoms. People with strollers have a difficult time and sometimes end up parking them and carrying small children. Check the website for hours as they change from day to day. Also, pack a small lunch, there is a charming shaded area with benches near the garden at the top that is very picturesque. Do your homework, it makes the experience so much better. An absolute must for history buffs!"

Note that in winter it closes, like the coliseum, already at 4:30 pm. However, it is much less crowded than the coliseum, and out of season pleasantly busy. Of some palaces and aqueducts quite substantial and impressive parts remain, so less imagination is necessary than for the Roman forum, where little remains except some columns. There are explanatory boards, but as my partner remarked, the information given is rather lousy, certainly if one compares to the presentation and information given at archaeological sites in Peru and other countries across Europe. Here, certainly a guidebook is necessary to fully appreciate what you are seeing. There is a small museum of which especially the 2nd floor is well worth a visit."

Read up on the site before visiting or take a good guide book with you as posted signs are few. Look for the place where the emperors used to sit and imagine what it must have been like when this was the seat of the entire Roman empire. Beautiful views of Rome including the Forum and Colosseum, from various places on the hill as well."

However, take a guide book as sometimes it is confusing as to what you are looking at. The area is no where near as crowded as the Forum area and the shade of the plane trees makes it a most pleasant excursion in the heat of summer. The buildings are just as spectacular as those in the Forum and is easier to navigate around. Even my husband who is no great lover of history was fascinated. The Palatine is well worth a visit and depending on how thorough you are can take anywhere between a quick hour to 3. Enjoy!!!"

Honestly it was way too much for one day as this is a lot of touring combined with lots of walking ( we walked there from our hotel- the Metro was having problems that day our hotel told us). So by the time we got here after touring the Colosseum and Forum, we were beat.We spent 1.5 each in the Colosseum, Forum and about an hour here. To really see the Forum, allow for 1.5 hours.If short on time, this can definitely be missed. Or do this separately when you have more energy. Another option is to see the Colosseum, have lunch in the Monti section of Rome right near the Colosseum and then tackle the Forum and Palatine Hill together. This way you won\u2019t be as tired.I found it OK but it was a lot of walking inside here. Plus they were doing lots of excavation which impacted the view. Had I been less tired, I would have enjoyed it more.If you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'helpful' button; those of us who write reviews live for those and it motivates us to do more."

Fortunately, there was a paper on the window that gave the visiting time (it's good if you can speak and read Italian) and after a few insisting moments, he finally sold us the tickets.The House is restored to it's grandeur and the frescoes are amazing! The 12:45 visit is only accompanied by one of the employees, so there is no narration or story telling. But it was amazing nonetheless! I am NOT an art connoisseur, nor a history buff, but I can see beauty when it's in front of me. To walk in what was once his private quarters and to imagine day to day life is really something else.I'm not sure how long it will be opened to visitors given that the Emperor's ramp was closed only 10 days after being opened, but if you can get to see this rare gem and you like to see things that are off the beaten path, then go. It's not easy to find the tickets, but when you do, you really feel you've found the hidden gem. Alternatively, you can book this visit through one of the tour agencies before you leave the country. I'd say that this would be worth the expense. Check Tripadvisor to know which company is more reputable than the others."

As with most historical sights, this one really benefits from a good guide. In fact, you will miss 70% of the experience without one. Fortunately our guide was excellent. I will try after this review to review the Segway company, but just in case i cannot, they were called \"Rome By Segway\", and I can honestly say, they that the were the icing on the cake of our Rome trip. Marcello was out guide, and he spoke perfect English, which was appreciated!"

Be advise, the entrance is down the main street and not just outside of the colosseum. Most people (like ourselves) went all the way up the hill and we had to walk all the way down to the entrance. The ruins are incredible and will take 2 to 3hr to visit. Plus, there are some easy grade hills you'll need to walk up. Also bring some water I don't remember seeing any inside. But, overall an amazing experience."

We hadn't prebooked or been to the forum or colosseum already so once inside we bought tickets on the door. There was literally no queue at the ticket office, so ironically we got in faster than many who already had tickets, who were the overwhelming majority, as they had to queue for the \"pre-booked\" turnstile while we walked straight through after buying ours. Anyway, turn left out of the entry gate and it's a lovely gentle walk up the hill, seeing the magnification Roman structures as you pass. There's so much to see that you could spend all day, however after a while one dilapidated building is much like another. Other reviewers have said there's not enough info available. I disagree. I think it's pitched about right. The signs dotted around the place give just enough info to know what went on without getting you too bogged down in the detail. If there was a sign on every building you'd need several days to read them all. There are regular drinking fountains along the way, and once you've reached the top there are vending machines and toilets. The view from the gardens at the top is pretty spectacular. You can see the whole of the Roman Forum beneath you as well as the rest of Rome. Tip - since its the same entry ticket for Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum, start with the hill first. For one, the queues are a lot shorter, but also you get a nice gentle walk up the hill before a steeper descent into the Forum, rather than the other way around."

Once you are inside, you can imagine what a great place this could have been in ancient times as all was built in attention to detail and in tandem. Perfectly laid gardens, horse training yards, right next to the Circus Maximus, arched or porticoes to walking for dignitaries and also to have a good time with their loved ones. There are few chambers dedicated to loved ladies at that era.Scale of the size of these standing pillars are proof that in ancient times they thought for the longer future where in modern days it is so difficult to get an extension to an existing dwelling. Worship areas dedicated to sacred Gods and Divines together with how they regard water springs, fountains and waterways as their life blood in that times are remarkable. Must see historical highlights in the World."

Like all the Roman attractions where private guides want your business, we found the maps and directional signs at this attraction to be confusing and inadequate. Some informational signs in English were helpful, but mostly what you are actually looking at are partial walls and columns and piles of rubble. Outdoor sights in Rome have been pretty much stripped of anything really good, you need to go to a secure museum or basilica to see much more than worthless remains and descriptions of memories. If you are into ancient history and have a vivid imagination, this area will appeal to you, but especially after Paris we found little here that was engaging. Nice outdoor walk away from traffic, and of course in winter not too crowded, so in that sense it was ok. We found a long ticket line at the colosseum but we were able to get a combination ticket for both attractions at the Palatine Hill gate in just 5 minutes. Got all the way up the hill on the adjacent road before realizing the entry was down the block from the ticket booth. Again, lack of good map"

It was beautiful, there was so much of it,it was so rich with history, it was fascinating and we could have stayed all day. You always see photos of places like this but being there was incredible as you can really experience the extent of what is going on. Rome should be very proud, they are saving this incredible place for all of us to experience. To be able to see what they have already exposed of these beautiful ruins and to get a peek into what they are still working on exposing was fascinating to us. Take your walking shoes and your camera and be ready for one beautiful sight after another!"

To be honest, I knew nothing about Palatine Hill when we arrived Rome - just that you could visit there when going to the Roman Forum and Colosseum. We had read that this was the best place to skip the long lines and buy our ticket for the other sites, and we wanted to start here and feel like we saw everything we could. I'm really glad we visited, and that this was our starting point.First, we didn't wait at all to buy tickets or get inside - so it was way better than starting at the Colosseum. And it was older. I felt like the stories here paid the foundation for the Roman Forum and Colosseum to come. Looking out over the Circus Maximus, and walking the grounds of the original Palace and trying to understand the life and people that were here even before that was eye opening. There is good information in the museum here which helped me understand the landscape better. Really glad we visited and started here. Spent about 1.5-2 hours before moving on to the Roman Forum. Note: Besides the museum, there isn't many signs or explanations. We had some information from a guide book on my phone to help orient us and give us information to better appreciate the site. I recommend doing the same, as there are no informative brochures available at this site (or, as it seems, most sites in Italy)."

One entry price covers the Palatine, Forum and Colosseum; so well worth a visit. The Palatine entry gate us less well known than that of the Forum or Colosseum; so the best spot to \"jump the line\" without paying the usual premium. Buy a good travel book to Rome, which provides a map and overview of Rome's ancient ruins and save on the guide. The ruins are well sign posted."

If you buy your ticket online, you spend 2 euro to avoid waiting in line but here there was no line here so I save my money which is a win in my book. Anyways, I wish i had gotten the audio guide. I'm not sure if you get it at the ticket desk or what but I definitely saw people with them. Plus there are signs that help you follow along.In my opinion, I think the people that are leaving negative reviews for this attraction as well as others is that they find it boring or not what they pictured. If you have no idea what you're looking at, ground with bits of remaining buildings, sculptures and temples could be disappointing. You have to use your imagination. These landmarks were very important parts of Roman lives and society. Walking the same places as Roman dignitaries blows my mind. Open your eyes to your imagination and enjoy! Tips: Bring a water bottle to fill up. The fountains have very drinkable water. Also, the stoney paths can be difficult to walk on. Please wear sensible shoes!"

It takes a bit of a walk upstairs to get up on top of the hill but it is so worth it. The sweeping views of Rome were breath taking and the view below onto the Roman Forum was amazing. The grounds were so peaceful and beautiful, even in winter. You can see why this place was the home of Romes most influential. When walking around I had a feeling come over me, I could feel something here, I cant explain it but i will never forget it. Make sure to visit the museum up top it is worth it, really cool history of the Hill, and its included in your ticket. This is must see and don't miss it, after you finish your walk around Palatine Hill, head down and walk through the Forum....another must see!"

Booking tickets in advance saves waiting in the the queues. To sum up this does compliment a visit of interest along with the Colosseum."

The ancient city of Rome is surrounded by Seven Hills and the Palatine Hill is the centermost hill. Recent excavations show that people have lived there since about 1000 BC. Many of the early rulers of Rome built their temples and homes on this hill. Over the centuries, the buildings have crumbled but are currently being restored to their original condition. I felt as though we had entered a time warp and had awakened in this ancient civilization. It is incredible that so much of this history is standing after all these many years. Our tour guide is also an archeologist and explained the difficult choices between leaving the current ruins standing or continuing to dig further down to uncover even older ruins.As you climb higher up the hill, there are park-like areas with shade trees and gardens. Audio tours are available for the Palatine and the Forum. You will need them (or a tour guide) to appreciate the history of these old churches, temples, etc. and the rulers who lived here."

It is not easy to bring the stroller, although it is not prohibited. You have to step some stairs, and walk on the ancient road with uneven surface."

The views are excellent, and the expanse of history displayed here is impressive."

If you only have time for one then take the gentle route up to the hill.The entrance for palatine hill and both the forum is about a 5 to 8 min walk away from the colosseum. From the entrance, ( remember to show your colosseum tickets) it is about roughly about a 20 min to 35 min stroll to the top.The route up is gentle but rocky. Hence wear comfy walking shoes. The Elderly will require some assistance and those with baby prams might want to leave those behind as there are steep, cobbled, uneven ground which will make you do twice the work. ( dont forget u have to go up and then down!)At the top, you will find it adorned with lovely orange trees, fountains and aqueducts which you can quench your thirst with. While tje view is magnificent. Becareful of the short railings. I peered down on the ledge and realised that some tourists have lost their hats, bottles and other valuables to the height. So keep ur stuff close and secure any loose items before going selfie crazy.The view is magnificent. And going there before noon will gurantee you enough sunshine for great photography and also less people to fight space with.To exit, you can either come down the same way, or proceed to the forum and explore the ruins further.Ps: beware of huge seagulls (i think) who are not afraid of tourists and will comfortably perch on the railings while you take your pictures."

Entrance is included in the Colosseum ticket. I would recommend to try and use the entrance to the left and down the street from the forum entrance. If this is not possible I would bear left from the forum entrance and follow the trail to the remains of the aqueduct. From here you can take a steady walk with a much gentler incline. There are water fountains dotted around and plenty of seating to rest and drink in your surroundings. It is a beautifully maintained area and every so often you are treated to some stunning glimpses of Roman ruins. At its peak the views across the city are unbelievable. There is a Palentine museum which is free. It is worth following every nook and cranny to discover some unexpected delights such as the underground fountain room. The views across the forum site and amazing and will serve to wet the appetite further. This is as must see as any site in this amazing city."

It is a bit of an uphill walk ( but only a few mins) however, the effort is worth it. Gorgeous views from the top of the looking onto the Roman Forum directly below, coliseum to one of the sides and the rest of the city to the other side. Good location for decent panoramic photos (and selfies)"

There is quite a walk up around 100 or so steps, but once you reach the plateau, it is worth it.We had a tour guide who took us from the Colosseum up to the Palatine Hill who was exceptional. Her name was Antonia and she was brilliant. She was incredibly knowledgeable and yes sassy and amusing at the same time meaning that we took more in than you may otherwise when information is delivered in a monotone. Antonia showed us around the Hill then led us to a terrace that overlooked the Forum, making it the perfect vantage point to see the important areas from above and so get a sense of the perspective and sheer size of the area. An excellent way to first get to trips with the Forum below."

It is the centermost hill of the Seven Hills of Rome. It is also located north of Circus Maximus and south of the Roman Forum. According to an old myth, this is the hill where Romulus and Remus were found and eventually founded Rome. The city was named after Romulus after he killed his brother. During an early period of Roman history several Emperors built palaces on the hill (you can still see the ruins) and the word palace comes from these buildings on Palatine Hill.I visited this amazing historical hill and the remains of an ancient palace (or palaces) with my wife and daughter on a Monday morning in mid-March and really enjoyed it. We hired a tour guide who seemed to know everything about this area and pointed out every important spot and ruin. Without his help it would have been a little confusing since most of the structures were only partially standing. I highly recommend that you tour this area with an experienced guide. I enjoyed the great views of Rome at the top and also enjoyed learning about the massive palace that was here.We bought a combination ticket for about 12 Euros which allowed us to visit the Colosseum, Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum. It was easier purchasing the ticket in the morning at the Palatine Hill location since there was no line at all. Make sure you keep track of your ticket as you will need to show it a second time when you get to the Colosseum (I just jammed it into my pocket and thought I had lost it).Overall I thought Palatine Hill was amazing and think it is another must see attraction in Rome. Go early to avoid the crowds."

They are major Rome attractions and well worth visiting. The two form a large, North-South oriented rectangle with the Palatine covering the bottom (South) three quarters, the Forum on the North. There are entrances (with ticket booths) at the bottom of the Palatine from Via di San Gregorio and to the Forum on the North from the Via dei Fori Imperiali. These are served by different bus lines. Tickets, which cost 12 Euros each, include the Palatine, the Forum, and the Colloseum, and are good for entrance on two successive days.The Palatine has ruins of the large buildings that housed emperors and other high-ranking Romans, a small Fascist-era museum with displays that exhibit discoveries made during excavations, and excellent views over the city. The Forum, in turn, was the political, religious, and commercial center of ancient Rome. The remains of the early buildings, plus the Arch of Titus, give a good idea of what a thriving and important place this once was. The Colosseum is separate and a short distance to the East of the Forum. Since Palatine paths can be steep, and surfaces rough, this is not a place for anyone whose walking is impaired. Restrooms are available.On our first day we took Bus #80 from Largo Argentina to the Palatine in the morning, bought our tickets, and spent two to three hours exploring before leaving for lunch. On the second day, we came back to see the rest of the Palatine... we had covered the southern two-thirds ... and the Forum. Sorry, we were told at the entrance, but our tickets were good for only one entrance to the Palatine/Forum and only one to the Colosseum. There were no signs at the entrance or indication on the tickets that this was the case. Gotcha! Since we did not want to ruin a precious day in Rome, we paid another 24 Euros for a second entrance and then saw the rest of the Palatine and the Forum.With the benefit of hindsight, we would have planned our Palatine/Forum trip differently. (We were not interested in seeing the Colloseum). Since the two are open from early morning (8:30 a.m.) to dusk, we would have brought food and something to drink, started earlier in the morning, entered by the same Palatine entrance, had lunch at the other end of the Palatine before descending to the Forum, and left by the Forum entrance/exit which is a fifteen-twenty minute walk to the Large Argentina and closer to the center of Rome and our hotel."

Previous reviews that I read recommended to start at Palatine Hill which takes you up to a beautiful overlook of the Roman Forum. The tour was amazing and way better than thought it would be. The only problem was that by the time we got down to the Forum, we (especially our kids) were really hungry so we left to get lunch without spending anywhere near the amount of time I wanted to spend in the Forum which was the best part. We went to our scheduled tour of Colosseum and by the time we were done it was evening and planned to go back to the Forum next day. Unfortunately, they told us that you could only do the Colosseum one day and Palatine Hill/Forum the other day, but can't go to same place twice. I was thoroughly disgusted since the Forum was basically what I traveled across the world to see and only saw 15 minutes of it! My recommendation is to start your day at the Forum FIRST, and then make your way up Palatine Hill, because there is no food unless you leave the gates. You might find yourself spending more time on Palatine Hill than you realize since a lot to see and very spread out, whereas the Forum is not as large with better preserved buildings so see it when your fresh!"

It stands 40 meters above the Forum Romanum, looking down upon it on one side, and upon the Circus Maximus on the other.It is the etymological origin of the word \"palace\" and its cognates in other languages (Italian \"Palazzo\", French \"Palais\", German \"Palast\", etc.)."

It was a cold day in December and had rained heavily the night before, so we had to dodge puddles and mud. But even with the rain and cold, this was a wonderful walk through time. According to Roman mythology, the Palatine Hill was the location of the cave where Romulus and Remus were found by a she-wolf. The Palatine is one of the seven hills of Rome and stands 40 meters above the Forum. You will see beautiful views of the city from here. I recommend that you google this site before a visit and read up on what you will be seeing; this may enhance your enjoyment."

Home to Nero's Palace where he watched Rome burn, it still provides fantastic views over the ruins of Rome's glory days.The paths and steps are worn and uneven in places so be careful and wear sensible footwear. There are many resources available to aid in understanding the area for people from a variety of language backgrounds including guide books, audio guides and guided tours. My wife and I chose to go at our own pace and make use of the information displays that were in both English & Italian. The Farnese Gardens were a treat providing a green oasis of shade on a warm day.Get your tickets either at the entrance to the Forum or the Palantine and it also includes the Colesseum. If you miss any of the 3 attractions listed on the ticket you can see it the following day but you can't return to one you've already entered. We did the Forum & Palantine and gave our feet a rest before skipping the line at the Colosseum the next morning. (We actually snuck up to St Peter in Chains to see Michelangelo's Moses first as it's very close when getting off the Metro.)"

Among the major sights of ancient Rome (Colosseum, Forum, Pantheon, Circus Maximus, etc.), this is arguably the best -- not for historical significance but for enjoyability in the midst of Rome's busy tourism season. While in the Forum and the Colosseum you'll be pushed and shoved and jostled by hoards of other people, Palatine Hill offers enough empty space to take a moment to relax and enjoy the shaded pathways among crumbling ruins. It's easy to spend 2-3 hours exploring this surprisingly large site. Make sure to bring a snack to eat if you think you'll get hungry.The Forum, Colosseum, and Palatine Hill share a common entrance ticket, and both when we entered and exited Palatine Hill, there was no line to purchase the ticket, so if you plan on visiting all three sights, this is a good place to start (the ticket is good for one entry into each of the sights and is valid for two consecutive days). We didn't get an audio guide and instead relied on a pocket guidebook, but the signage is rather poor, so it might be worthwhile to pay the additional fee for the audio guide if you're interested in ancient Roman history. I would also recommend visiting without a tour guide -- we actually saw it twice (once on our own and a second time as part of a walking tour) and enjoyed it much more when we could set our own pace and route. There are so many different paths and interesting angles that you don't get to see if you're just part of a pack of people following behind a tour guide."

The hill where the Emperors lived and where Romulus is rumoured to have lived is a maze of paths and ruins with much still being excavated. You get a view from the far end of the site of the Circus Maximus (just empty ground but you can see the shape). There is a museum up here with toilets. There are also huge rabbits.

After touring the Forum, etc., be sure to walk up the hill. There is so much more there than you can imagine. As long as it's not raining, the weather doesn't make any difference. We went on a very dark day, but it still made for some very interesting photographs. Recommend a guide; ours had much to share that brought what we saw to life. One of my favorite days!"

If that's not your thing so much, there are still gorgeous views and beautiful ruins.Your ticket for Palatine Hill is good for the Forum and the Colosseum also. (Remember you can use them for two days, but can ONLY ENTER EACH SITE ONCE. It's almost three days worth of sights, but it seems easier to break it up into one day at the Colosseum and one at the Forum and Palatine.)This is the place where you can see Augustus' and Livia's palaces, Circus Maximus, and roam a museum with some of the art removed from the sites in Palatine and the Forum. It's a park-like setting and a comfortable and easy walk (albeit long).Like all places in Rome watch for pick-pockets. I don't know how they operate in the open spaces like Palatine without getting seriously up close and personal--but it was a repeated warning over loud-speaker the days I went. My goal touring Palatine was to see the murals at Livia's palace--but you need to book that tour separately and I didn't realize that and missed it. So heads up if you want to see anything special, investigate ahead of time. Now I just have one more reason to return to Rome.One of the days I toured was in the rain--which was fun if you have the proper gear and an umbrella. There are vending machines on Palatine with snacks."

So much to see if you love your Roman history you are steeped in it here. Helps to have some sort of guide/map - even if you print one of the internet. If you don't then it can all get a bit much theres so much ground to cover. Otherwise you could miss so much detail. On the plus size you really get the feel of ancient Rome, its size and splendour even if every bit has been sacked to decorate all the zillions of Churches in Rome. If you've seen all that ecclesiastical use of marble and stone use your imagination and add it to all you see in Palatine Hill and you'll be in awe of what ancient Rome must have been in all its Glory.BIG MINUS - Theres NO cafe or drink stops here so if its a hot day take something. I was here for 4 hours and with nothing even in this area of Rome except the odd street vendor ended up dizzy with dehydration. Even the toilets are spread out so plan and work out where these are in case they are at the other end of the site when you need one\u2026it can be a long way to cross your legs!"

The Roma pass is also usable here giving you either free or discounted entry. This hill situated next to the Roman forum is where the rich used to build their huge palaces. The word palace actually comes from the word Palatine and you can well see why. Although there are notice boards around giving descriptions on what the ruins used to be, i would say that a tour or audio guide is probably useful to gain a better insight into the area. From the ruins you can imagine the size and beauty the palaces must once have looked like. It is incredible to think these palaces (one for the Emperors of Rome) existed so long ago. The area has a bit more shade that the Forums and has great views of the Forum on one side and the Baths of Septimius Severus and the remnants of a chariot arena (Circus Maximus). There is a museum here too which has a collection of Pottery and statues."

It is rich with history and the ruins are quite interesting. It is also not very crowded, which is simply wonderful!

And if it was a lovely summer day (70 - 80 degrees F) I might be game for exploring. But in the August heat I was not happy. We spent 2 hours at the Colisseum, and that is enough ruins for me in one day. The most precious commodity of the day is cool drinking water, so plan ahead. Admission to Palatine Hill is often included with an admission package to The Colisseum, so check the details when purchasing tickets. I think Palatine Hill admission adds very little (or no) value to a Colisseum ticket. Plan for weather and wear REALLY comfortable shoes."

A tour would probably be beneficial as well, if you're willing to spend some more money. Also, make sure to give yourself plenty of time to see everything! We had no idea how much time could be spent in there, and I'm sure we were there for the better part of 3-4 hours. Your ticket is only good for one admission, so make sure to eat prior to your visit, and/or bring some snacks- we were wishing we had, as we felt a little light-headed and pretty exhausted by the time we finally called it quits.All in all, this is a must-see in our book!

We stared walking the place thinking that it was going to take us a hour or so; we were so wrong. The more we walked up the more we found more to walk and it was a big puzzle that was a bit confusing at times. There is so much history in the place that I order to really appreciate it one need to dedicate a good 4 hours to see it all. After a while my wife and I go so tired of the walking that we weren't sure if it was worth it. Luckily once we got to the top of the hill and we saw the breathtaking views it kind of made up for all the walking. There were a couple of museum buildings which were very interesting and it kept us away from the heat for a while."

This city once housed over 1.5 million Romans. A population that was only equaled in the 1800's in London!Definitely worth a visit!"

You can walk around Palatine Hill snd the Roman Forum all day with incredible views of the ruins and of the city as well, all breathtaking, however be aware that there are no concessions inside, there are toilets in the museum and water fountains but thats it, you may want to bring snacks with you especially if you have kids, its the perfect setting for a picnic depending on the weather of course, also there is a lot of walking involving steps and inclines not a great idea for the very old or young.

This may be fine in some circumstances it's not when you are in heat of around 40 degrees with little shade. To make matters worse one of our audioguides didn't work and had to be returned but this can only be done at the site you have bought it - even though there are other areas where they can be hired on the site you can't swap it there so it's another long walk there and back to sort this one out. The excavations here are fabulous but be prepared for a lengthy visit and best to go very early morning before the main heat of the day arrives"

Huge stone and marble statues and carvings or elegantly painted murals in golds, blues and reds. At Palatine hills, images change up a little because the greenery of nature breaks the monotonous ancient grays that your eyes have become accustomed to seeing. Being on higher ground, the air is much cooler and refreshing there also. There are great views from above. The incline is not a stressful walk but the larger stones and the haphazard way they are laid may make it difficult for some people with knee, hip problems to navigate. You must place your feet carefully when walking."

For those out of shape or those with knee/joint problems, it can be a challenge getting up and down the hill.You can spend anything from an hour to 2-3 depending on how much you want to dig into history.

I'm glad we did though. There's a lot of walking to be done and in the heat it was exhausting. Wear comfortable shoes as it's quite difficult to walk on stones, gravel and uneven paths The views of the Colosseum, the forum and Capitoline are really good. We walked aimlessly as the signage is not good at all. We relied on our guidebook for information and followed tour groups for directions. If you love history then you might be better off joining a tour group for detailed facts. We took refuge from the heat and visited the museum which has statues and artefacts from the Palatine which was interesting. This place was once dwellings for the rich and noble back in the day but you have to use your imagination when walking around as it's now ruins. This place was OK but I prefer the Colosseum."

From the palatine hill you can walk down to the old forum, it is easy to imagine the 'great men' of Rome walking with there followers down to the forum to conduct business as was the norm in the days of the Repuplic.

At that time, I did not appreciate its importance. Now I do. The Colosseum may be the symbol of today\u2019s Rome, but it was merely a place of entertainment in the good old days. By contrast, the Palatine Hill may not be best-known in our time, but it occupied a unique place in Roman history. The city had its origin on the Palatine. Romulus and Remus were found to live here, and Augusta, the first roman emperor, was said to be born here. Many rich and powerful called this hill home. Many sites have been excavated and well-preserved. For example, a hippodrome still looked impressive, and a museum exhibits many precious artifacts. Just as Tsar, Kaiser, and Shah derived from Caesar, the word \u201cpalace\u201d originated from the word \u201cPalatine.\u201dThere were reasons for its historical role. The hill was the centermost one among Rome\u2019s seven hills. Living at the top of the hill provided people with physical safety and beautiful views. When I am writing this review, an analogy came to my mind. What the Palatine Hill was to the Roman Forum was what the Acropolis was to the ancient Agora. Having stayed here for several hours, I walked down to the forum."

The view from the top provides a great feeling of what the Italian Capital City was like back in time of the Roman Empire many years ago. The unique architectural structure although ruined following past earthquakes, wars and development are very well preserved and there are places that are still slowly being uncovered releasing many hidden gems. The area can be very hot on the sunny day, so it is best to bring plenty of water and put on sun-screen as they is very little shade. Always a great position and place for photo opportunities. You can also observe other historical building from Rome at a distance from Palatine Hill such as the Colosseum for example. We liked what we had seen and it was no wonder that it is one of a few most explored places in Rome. The only downside will be a lot of walking involved so if it is going to be a problem, always ask your guide for advice or if you are on a private car tour, ask your driver for help and assistance. Apart from that, it is the most wonderful places to see in Rome and no tour would be complete without it."

Please note if you bought a ticket for Colosseum this also includes Roman Forum and Palatine Hill. No need to buy additional tickets. We made a mistake of buying additional tickets seeing a queue there without realizing that our Colosseum tickets are valid here as well."

We purchased our ticket at the Palatine hill and had no queue whatsoever. Just buy and enter, as easy as that.One word of caution though - The Foro Romano and Palatine Hill are one complex. So, if you, like us leave the Palatine Hill and come to Colosseum you will not be able to enter the Forum at all.So visit the Palatine Hill and Forum in one go and then come to the Colosseum.

It takes a lot of walking, but you see some magnificent ruins. Wear really good shoes because its a lot of hills, sloping up and down, lot of stairs as well. When you first walk in there is a small fountain against a low wall and I saw people filling their water bottles with it. Bring water with you for you will get dehydrated walking this area. Don't miss the Palatine Museum, it's got some excellent examples of statues and other things they found dug up from around the area. Also, it is air conditioned. So after walking around the forum and the hills, it's an excellent place to catch your breath and enjoy some beautiful antiquities. Walk behind the museum and look at the rest of the ruins and continue to the far end where you can get a nice view of the Circus Maximus. I walked back down and took the exit by the Temple of Antoninus & Faustina and it took me out to the Via Imperiali."

            "review": "The Founding Place of Rome. Rome was founded on this hill's slopes. There are huts of a small village here as old as the the 10th century BC. In ancient times the 'huts of Romulus and Remus' were ceremonially refurbished here each year. Most politically and culturally prominent Romans resided here during the Roman Republic, and it was only natural that the imperial families and their emperors establish their residences (palaces) on the Palatine. Unfortunately, the Palitine is a poor third when it comes to touring the 'Big Three' of Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine. Why is that? I have a theory. Perhaps this happens because of the impressive and historic nature of both the Colosseum and Corum. Maybe too the geography plays a part. The summit of the Palatine is a steep climb up,fro either the Forum or the Colosseom. That 140-150 foot vertical ascent is pretty steep, and that means that tourists - after walking around, up,and down both the Colosseum and the Forum - they don't look forward enthusiastically to having to climb up that slope to the top of the Palatine and then walk around a third time looking at all of the imperial-era remains. But if you want to see the places where 'Romulus lived and founded Rome, if you want to see the remains of the House of Augustus, if you want to see the ruined Palaces of Augustus, Tiberius, Domitian and other emperors, and if you want to see fabulous views from this height of Rome, you simply must make the climb. Rest at the hilltop Museum, or alongside the octagonal,fountain amid the ruins, or in the Farnese Gardens. There is a lot to see here, but a bit difficult to find an easily readable map of the place (most are complicated and scholarly, and many in Latin), Rick Steves supplies a solution with a convenient, readable, hand drawn map in English. It is published by the authors of a travel blog called 'Those Crazy Schuberts'. You can also Google 'Rick Steves Palatine Map' and it will be among the first images that appear in Google Images. Regardless of where you obtain a copy, print it out and take it with you. It is very readable, in English and will point out all the major sites. The ancient 'athletic area' or 'garden' is also of interest, being sunken. Of course there are only ruins left. No marble, wood, iron or bronze. But that can be said of almost all ancient monuments around the city. The point is that people interested in this History of Rome should also cherish the opportunity to walk where the people who made that history lived and walked. And that 'where' is atop the Palatine Hill. Enjoy!"

It must of been fantastic in its day but very little remains now, it is a good walk around but they should put some pictures around the place so you can see what you are looking at because it is hard to visualize what some of the structures would of been like. If your visiting the Colosseum you get free entry to this place so you can't not check it out while your there being as it is located next door."

The walking is on cobble and can be very uneven, with that said, take your time and enjoy the history before your eyes and under your feet. Be prepared for ticket sellers, tour salesman, selfie stick sellers and just a bunch of other street salesman who have nothing better to do but try and separate you from every euro you might have hidden in your secret travel wallet. Although kinda pushy, most street salesmen will back off if you ignore them completely, as soon as you acknowledge them, they are on you like vultures on a roadkill. The sights are usually very busy and you can have a tough time if you traveled around the world and think you deserve to have these places to yourself, but if you keep an open mind and realize that nearly everyone else in the world wants to see these places just like you do, and accept the fact that the ruins are on everyone else's list of things to see, it just makes it that much more cool that you are actually there doing it. I was near a couple who complained about the \"horrible uneven walking surfaces\" and all the people there who were crowding all the sights they had planned for months to see.... Comfortable shoes and an open mind will go a long ways towards making your sightseeing more enjoyable."

The Palatine Hill is located adjacent next to the colosseum and towers over the Roman forum \u2013 it is covered in the 12 euro \u2018ancient rome\u2019 pass which encapsulates these three key famous attractions. It was ancient romes most exclusive neighbourhood and a famous site where Romulus supposedly killed his twin brother Remus and founded the city in 753BC. Unfortunately time and medieval re-development has been cruel to this area and its present structures require a bit of imagination, as well as a decent guide to actually get much out of a visit. I would recommend downloading the FREE \u2018Rick Steve\u2019s Europe\u2019 audio guide on your smartdevice (ie iphone or ipad) and listening to it via earphones. It will allow you to get more out of your experience and is free. A real highlight of palantine hill is its viewing platform over the roman forum \u2013 this is a great spot for photos \u2013 particularly if you zoom in on the colosseum. It\u2019s also good for getting orientated if you plan to visit the forum later in the afternoon. A common approach to a visit to palantine hill is to combine it with its 2 adjacent attractions (they are even included in the same ticket) in the same day and this is sensible. Just beware that the colosseum should be visited 1st up, as the queues will build up during the day (less of an issue for the roman forum). You need a bit of time out between this is and the forum and there are a surprising amount of large open green spaces so pack a lunch and relax before taking on the forum in the afternoon. Bring water as there is none on sale in palatine hill. There\u2019s also only a couple of sets of bathrooms \u2013 one in the small museum."

I decided that as I had the whole day ahead of me that I would spend the morning on the hill and look at the Roman Forum before going to the Coliseum at lunchtime. First of all it's true that you don't have to queue very much to get in which is a bonus. Secondly everywhere you look, and there is so much to see, you are greeted with picture postcard views and historical gems. There is a great little museum that you can look around. There are also fantastic vantage points over the Forum, Coliseum, Circus Maximus, over towards the Vatican, over Rome.. The ruins of the various palaces are inspiring. The site leads directly into the Forum which was also fascinating. I spent so much of the day up on the hill that by the time I'd looked around the Forum I actually decided to finish for the day and return to the Coliseum the following day. The great thing is that your ticket is valid for two days across the three sites. Originally, if my ticket haven't included Palatine Hill I would have only visited the Forum and the Coliseum. I'm so glad I saw Palatine Hill, it's definitely a place worth visiting, and somewhere I hope to return when next in Rome."

The first time I went in 2010 I didnt go in due to time constraint, also I didnt do research so I thought just bunch ruins on the hill.This time we joined a private tour outside coloseum for $30 Euro per person, we got the skip the line access and a guide for ColosseumIt turns out the regular ticket for colosseum also includes entrance for Palatine Hill, and the $30 we paid also include a guide waiting for us at 2PM.The guide Gregory explained a really good story about the development of the Hill over time, how magnificient it was with 5 floor temple and palace, he also explained the ruins are due to human force of the Vatican instead of natural disaster.Overall very good view on top of the hill."

We did some research before hand and then just enjoyed strolling through while all the flocks of tourists with frowns stared in different directions with earphones glued to their heads. I remained oblivious. Ruins are not my thing as I am a gardener and need desperately to see Green before I am happy. There were plenty of grasses and wild meadow flowers, or more accurately 'weeds', for me to frame my pictures so I was happy. You have to go see this purely because you are in Rome and very little else in the world is this old. Join the rest of the crowds and get with the spirit! I read online to buy our tickets here and not at the Colosseum where the queues are ridiculous. So we kept walking till we found a little office, but I think it was the ticket office for the Forum. No queues there. And the ticket worked for all three entries with skip the line access. Wonderful!"

For that reason those ruins has been preserved by romans like we do for Colosseo today. The famous Emperor Augusto lived there in very small rooms. Today is still possible to see some frescos from 2000 years ago. The big horses' stadium, columns, mosaics, a little casino built in midage full of stunnings frescos (you need a special permission to see inside it) and the view of Rome all around are the topics of the visit.Enjoy it.Aldo"

The vast array of ruins, remains of ancient Roman buildings and structures, some of which has been excavated is both awesome as well as eerie since one gets surrounded by the memorable scenes from various History programs and movies standing there atop the Palatine Hill, one gets overwhelmed that the various majestic and some not so majestic characters had once wined, dined, supped and danced in these very places. The view especially of the Colosseum and Circo Massimo is breathtaking. Palatine Hill itself is not as high as I had imagined but nevertheless a great experience.Since the entry ticket to the Colosseum and Palatine Hill is common, to avoid the great rush at the Colosseum, one may purchase it at the Palatine Hill, where the ticket booth does not have long queues. Walking shoes or joggers are recommended since the ruins are spread over a vast area. Drinking water is recommended because there are water fountains but too few and far apart. Umbrellas are recommended to avoid the sun or inclement weather."

When the boys grew up they decided to build a new city of their own on the banks of the Tiber, then had a violent argument resulting in Romulus killing brother Remus. Rome got its name from brother Romulus. Nearby is the Hippodrome, Piazza Navona, and Palatine Museum and Palatine House, which was only recently discovered in 2006.

We bought combination ticket in Forum for all: the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill and for the Coliseum. Line was only ~15-20 min. We saved a lot of time compare to the lines in the Coliseum.It is beautiful place and full of history, we used Rick Steve\u2019s book as a guide. We spent a lot of time in both Forum and Palatine Hill and honestly could spend even more, but we left because we also wanted spend some time in the Coliseum as well and we were not sure how much time we would need. You need more time for Forum & Palatine Hill than for the ColiseumRoman Forum is pretty crowded. It was also hot because it's all open space. There are a few places with water fountains, where you can drink or refill your bottle. There are no places to eat inside the Palatine Hill and not so many bathrooms. It\u2019s huge; you need to be on foot for long time.We liked the place, but one person in our party was robbed on Caesar\u2019s Tomb. Pickpocketing - wallet disappeared from pocket of our friend pants in blink of an eye. Some man asked to take a picture of him on Caesar\u2019s Tomb and after this our friend's wallet was gone. He didn\u2019t feel a thing. Beware! We read about pickpockets and thieves before the trip and tried to be careful, but it happened anyway. After this case we were afraid to carry all our money and documents with us. A couple days later we left Rome and went to Tuscany for a week. On our 2nd day in Tuscany our villa got robbed... We lost much of our money, credit cards, jewelry, documents including passport, driver's licenses, etc. Instead of enjoying Tuscany we were spending time in police and US Embassy. It really helped that we had copies of our passports, because we didn\u2019t have any other documents left with our name on it. It took 3 weeks to restore all our documents after coming home. We will remember this trip for a long time. We travel extensively and it never happened to us before. Just be careful."

Our expert tour guide, Cristiano with Easitalytours.com navigated through narrow, winding streets to show us this great view!"

The marbles and the statue's it's everywhere you just don't know where to look. We were here for hours and I could have stayed longer. Water available plus loos and I would say wear a hat and sunscreen, the breeze is there and it's easy to forget the heat.Amazing views of the colosseum and rome itself. If this was the only thing I could have done in rome I can honestly say I would not have been disappointed"

Palantine Hill had great views - this was my favourite part of the three.Btw, if you want to catch a bus back into the city, make sure you pre-purchase return tickets.

I did this review for the Colosseum, but also wanted to share it here:There is not much I can add to this incredible piece of history than what is already out there. However, I am writing this review to give tips to travelers going there for the first time. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BOOK A SKIP THE LINE TOUR if you follow these tips.Tips:1. DO NOT START AT THE COLOSSEUM. It's by far the longest lines and there is not point on standing in line when you dont have too. Instead, go in thru the Palatine Hill entrance. If you are taking the metro in, do not get off at the Colosseum exit. Instead go to the Circo Massimo and exit there. Then walk up the Via d. San Greggorio and you will see the entrance on the left. We had a two minute wait while the Colosseum entrance had a 1 hour wait. The same ticket, which cost 12 Euros (and its free for 18 and under), gets you into Palatine Hill and the Roman forum (which are attached) and the Colosseum (separate). To go into the colosseum, all you have to do is get on the \"have ticket line\" which is the same the tour companies use for their \"skip the line\" tours.2. It is going to take you 4-6 hours to see all three places, so get plenty of water and eat if you have kids with you. You cannot buy drinks or food once inside. Rome is hot, and this place is huge and hilly, so be ready for a good workout.3. Watch out for pickpockets. A lady tried to pick pocket my brother.4. Take the time. This is really an amazing place.

NOTE-There are many, many \"vendors\" in the area. Be careful. Most of these vendors are on the streets illegally. We were cautious and did not have any problems. They mostly sell Selfie-sticks, hats, scarfs and bottled water. If you need to buy any of these items please stick to the gift and souvenir shops. Your guide can direct you. Also, DO NOT ACCEPT any flowers or roses which are handed to you for being a \"beautiful lady\". They are not free. If you take the flower they will chase you down for money - usually 5 Euros. The vendor kiosks in front of the attractions are mostly OK, but be sure that what you are paying for is what is being placed in the bag. Get a look before handing over you money.

It is one of the original 7 hills of Rome, and thought to be the one where the earliest part of the city was founded. In contrast to the throngs of people at the Forum and Colosseum, we had a leisurely and private walk up the hill. We are 60, but it was not too strenuous. I would recommend going in the morning, before the heat of mid day. There are several noteable stops, including a fountain/former aviary, gardens with roses and fruit trees, and tremendous overlooks/vista points for the whole city of Rome. It gave us a nice respite before we tackled the Forum, where again, there were bigger crowds. Highly recommend."

I think without a tour guide to give us all the stories, facts, and background, it would not have been as fascinating. This was one of only 2 tours we bought in our 11 days in Italy, and I would definitely do it again. We did listen to some Rick Steves audio guides at a couple of other places though, and that might be an option if you didn't want to pay for a guide."

Me i think of the history . We purchased an omnia card for 89 euros each normal price 98 we got ten percent of as a promotion was on this gave us 3 days free transport on metro busses and the open top tour bus . Free entry at the colosseom , palantine hill and a rome museum and then discounted price on other museum, free entry at sisteen chapple and vatican museum with also free entry at st peters basilica and st peters prison ( all fast track entry thank god ) I LOVE history and you will find no finer example of it than Rome ! On the hill you get a real glimps of the real old Rome how magnificent these ruins have stood to the test of time. Everyone dont miss this opertunity yes there is a steep hill to climb but the garden at the top that overlooks the roof tops of rome is awesome again guided tours with headsets are available if you like to have everything explained to you in detail. Me i use a book and imagination ( cause i am apparently a big kid for roman history :-)"

Whilst I had heard of it before to be honest I had no idea what to expect.As we made a slow leisurely walk up the long pathway that brings you to the top of the Palatine Hill (one of the Seven Hills of Rome), our guide told us that according to Greek mythology the Palatine Hill was the birthplace of Romulus and Remus the twin brothers, who were suckled and raised by a she-wolf and later became the founders of Rome.At the summit of the Palatine Hill there is an amazing collection of ruins, a museum, the remains of the Farnese Gardens and a view you cannot believe. From various vantage points throughout the area you can see the remains of what was once the Circus Maximus and the Roman Forum - incredible!!!I would highly recommend to anyone visiting the Colosseum, Roman Forum to take the time to walk to the summit of the Palatine Hill, you will not be disappointed."

Up on top of the hill the views are great, including some nice views of the Colosseum, the Circus Maximus and other parts of the city. We really enjoyed looking at how they built things. The stonework and columns and thick walls must have taken a lot of work.Here's a tip. Go to the Palatine Hills first and buy a joint ticket for the Palatine Hills and the Colosseum. Visit the Palatine Hills and then exit by the gate overlooking the Colosseum. At the Colosseum there were two lineups. A short one for those who already had tickets and a really, really long one for people wanting to buy tickets. It only took us five minutes to get inside and we saved a lot of time by have tickets in hand."

There is a lot of standing/walking on hard and uneven stones for an extended period of time if you want to go all over and take everything in. It's not worth being sore or aching if you're on a trip. Buy the pass that gets you into the Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill. It is good for use over two days so if you really want to look around at everything I personally would recommend doing the Forum and the Hill one day and then the Colosseum the next even though they are all in the same area. It will make it more enjoyable to get out of the sun and off of your feet to split things up. Read up on the Forum first so you can really appreciate what you are seeing."

You buy your ticket for a certain day but not a certain time. So for the day you want to go on the tour, you purchase your ticket and you may join any tour group they have throughout the day which start every 30minutes. I would suggest catching the earliest tour possible (9am) as the tour groups can become quite large in the afternoons. We first toured to Coliseum- our guide was very nice, made sure we all stayed together in the crowds at the coliseum and gave great information and history about it. We were able to skip the very long line of people trying to get into the coliseum without a tour which was nice. We did not have any headsets for this tour so you did have to stay close to the guide to ensure that you could hear-which she did a good job of projecting. The tour group was small (about 10) so asking questions etc was very easy. You were given plenty of time after the tour to look around the coliseum and take pictures. The tour was approximately one hour.  The tour then continued with a tour of Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum. We joined up with a different tour guide for this portion and ended up part of a very large tour group consisting of about 50 people which at times made it a bit difficult to hear (there were no headsets for this tour either) but our tour guide was very diligent to be sure everyone was keeping up, could hear, and got all of the information. She would repeat herself whenever needed. We got a lot of good information and history about the area and after the tour (which was about an hour) we were given free reign to look and wander around wherever we wanted in the very large area. I know there is no possible way of giving an entire history lesson on a 1 hour tour but from overhearing some of the other tour guides from other companies, I do feel like we may have missed out on some key historical facts. There are multiple stairs at each location so I would not recommend bringing strollers unless they are small and light as you will have to carry them at times (remember, its an ancient city\u2014they were not very handicapped accessible in those times)."

I would recommend to buy the ticket at the Palatine Hill entrance booth on Via Di San Gregorio. A bus stop is located at the entrance. 12 Euros (May 2015). The advantage of doing so is the fact that the queues are shorter then on the other two attractions and after you have seen the Palatine Hill you stroll down to the Forum rather then climbing up the steep hill. The site itself is very interesting and there is a museum which shows the archaeological findings and the past glory of this place. I also recommend to take a guide book with you. When going to the Roman Forum, you still stay in the closed boundary of the site.The first Monument on the Forum is the Titus Arch. The whole tour will take about 4-6 hours. Make it early morning to avoid the heat and take a battle of water with you."

Just over a week ago, on my way to the Termini train station, I had to ask my taxi driver to stop and let me walk on the streets of Roma Antica. I grew up here and it is still moving to step where Emperors and the citizens of Rome lived their lives. The Market place, the Senate, the place of woship dedicated to Athena ,the Campo Marziowhere war victories were celebrated, The Temple to Vesta, the Arch of Emperor Tito where the returning heroes were hailed...it seems we can hear the crowds almost. It is so solemn, so powerful to be there ! And yet, I , We cannot but admire all these building still standing, in spite of the 2000 years, the endless invasions, the wars and the desecrations, Then ,impressive and moving at the sametime, is to note all around the Roman pines grand umbrellas, the wild flowers all growing at the Palatino. Nature is there making all human, gentler, attractive, pleasing to the eye, even romantic. Then it comes to my mind the movie Roman Holidays and please, watch that classic before you visit the Palatino, it will make it so much more personal...\" just you and those grandiose ruins\""

Got the tickets at the Palatine Hill & The Roman Forum because the queue's at the Colosseum were very long (about 10am). we queued for about 20 minutes to get the tickets then joined another queue to actually go in for about another 20 minutes. The tickets were 12 euro's each and include admission for the Colosseum as well, so it's an absolute bargain compared to The National Trust in England. You can quite easily spend all day in the Forum and Palatine Hill if ancient history is you thing and the tickets were valid for 2 days anyway. we spent about 3.5 hours wandering round the Palatine Hill & Roman Forum before we exited onto Via dei fori imperiali to get some refreshments. Walking back down towards the Colosseum the queue's had all but disappeared (about 3pm) and we were able to go straight in & queue for the ladies toilets inside instead. The Colosseum was a good experience too well worth an hour of anybody's time. I think the three attractions combined are just right for a good day out but be prepared to queue at some point."

From the Forum area you can see some ruins on the Palatine Hill, but you have no sense of the scale of the place, or its place in the history of Ancient Rome. I had read a couple of historical novels by Robert Harris about the Roman senator and consul Cicero, and knew that even during the Republic, so pre-Empire, the Palatine was the place to live. So we went to the Palatine Hill entrance where lines were very short, and embarked on touring the sites. It was great. The area is now very park-like, so lots of shade. Near the entrance was a map which we took a picture of with our iPad and used as we toured. Don't miss the overlooks of the Forum area and the Colosseum. The one suggestion I would offer is to pack a lunch, as no food is sold (there is water available, and restrooms). Also note that your ticket covers all 3 sites of the Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill; you get only one entry per site, but you can visit over a couple of days, so plan ahead."

The palatine hill is a good place to visit but with the area just being ruins and small ruins eg mainly small rocks, it's easy to only get bored within an hour of being here. I would say go and it would be really good if your on a tour and they explain everything to you, otherwise it's a bit meaning less just seeing rocks on the floor without the story behind it. Would go, but don't expect to spend more than an hour here, the best place is at the top of the hill to take photos and is lovely there."

I was on a guided tour with a school group, and was disappointed when the guide said we would be going to the palatine hill and not into the forum as it was so hot.However once we got up there, I was so not disappointed anymore! This whole area is stunning, and opened up a whole new section of Rome's history I knew nothing about. And the views...breathtaking! The best view of the colosseum, and down onto the forum as well.From what I understand, you can easily go into the forum as well, but on a hot day with 32 sweltering teenagers, this was a great way to get out of the heat and learn a bit of history as well."

Because one has to enter this wooded hill through a guarded gate and have bags searched, it seemed that the vast majority of tourists vied away from entering. Once in, however, one is in an oasis of peaceful ancient palace ruins (Palatine - palazzo - palace, yes, the origin of the word). This was where the ancient aristocracy would escape from the chaos of the city and it is as true today as it was 2000 years ago. They are still excavating up here but still there is a wealth of fascinating buildings. The view from the hill down onto the forum area is the best way to appreciate the ancient city."

There are already thousands of reviews of Palatine Hill, so I won't repeat them. I just wanted to add that the ticket to Palatine Hill is in conjunction with the Roman Forum. So although the ticket is valid for 24 hours, you can't go in the forum one day and then to the hill the next day. You must go to both on the same visit. If you buy the combo ticket with the Colosseum, then you can go to the Colosseum one day and then Palatine/Forum the next, if you can't finish all three sites in one day. I'm mentioning this because I learned the hard way. I had visited the Colosseum and the forum, hoping to see Palatine the next day, since it was almost closing time. However, the guard informed us that once the ticket is used to enter the Forum, we couldn't use it again the next day for Palatine. Hope this little piece of advice helps someone enjoy their visit to Rome better!"

This is where Roman Emperors and other important families resided during ancient Roman times. You can enter and view the ruins here as part of a combined visit to see the Colosseum and Roman Forum. Entry (\u20ac12 per person). Sadly, the palace grounds, gardens and houses found at Palatine Hill have been in a state of ruins for many centuries, leaving only a glimpse of the grandeur that would have adorned this famous hillside many during the height of ancient Rome. What does fortunately remain include some lovely wall frescoes at Domus Augustus and the House of Livia, if they are open at the time of your visit. You can see some nice artefacts at the Palatine Museum (free to enter at Palatine Hill). These were mostly unearthed here during previous excavations. There is also interesting display in the museum for the Iron Age period Huts of Romulus which you can also see at the southwest corner of Palatine. Another neat place to visit at Palatine Hill is the 16th century Farnese Garden. This was the first private botanical garden in Europe. Then make your way to the viewing area overlooking the Roman Forum. If you have a guidebook, you can study the building below and identify what they are before/after walking through the Forum. Tip: To get the most of your visit to Palatine Hill, it is advisable to purchase a good guidebook and to spend some time going over the ruins found here before you visit. This will help prepare you for what to look for when wandering the Forum grounds. Tip: The grounds around the Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum can be uneven. Do bare this in mind when thinking about footwear. Tennis or hiking shoes are most suitable for exploring the grounds. Overall, we'd suggest first seeing Colosseo and the Roman Forum, if time is limited. These are higher impact areas that you will likely better remember after your trip is finished. However, if you have time, it is well worth also visiting Palatine Hill to see the ancient structures, ruins and museum here as well."

The Palatine Hill, though being the most ancient part of the Colosseum/Roman Forum/Capitoline Hill complex (the theory is that's where the first Roman settlers picked their residence) is also the least interesting, in our opinion. It is significantly less preserved, the remaining vestiges of the past Roman glory are not that striking neither they are evident for a non-Rome scholar. Add to that the area that takes up a huge stretch above the Roman Forum along with continuous climbing, and you get a modest 4-star rating. The panoramic view of Rome, or rather its south-western part is quite impressive though. But again, without a good tour guide, even the Circus Maximus doesn't look like much. House of Augustus and Stadium of Domitian surprise with their enormous scale but the state of preservation is minimal. If you are limited in time and are facing an option of what sites to choose - pick the Capitoline Hill instead or spend more time at length at the Roman Forum."

It is a delightful place to stroll round and admire what is left of the magnificent buildings in which the great and the good of ancient Rome lived away from the smells of the people down in the city. There is an excellent small museum, and a wonderful viewing platform. It is perhaps the best spot from which to take in the whole of the Forum and helps to put its buildings into perspective. Plenty of benches in the shade and fountains where you can fill up your water bottles. Very much worth a visit."

Make sure you're prepared, but there is an open fountain and bathroom at the top by the gardens. Last but not least, they're very disorganized at the gate. If you have online tickets and didn't print it out, they will tell you that you can't get in and won't print off tickets for you. This is stupid because the online tickets clearly state that you can bring it to be scanned, that's why they're call \"online tickets\". What it really is, is the fact that they're lazy and their scanners do not work, nor will the ticket office give you a ticket. Kick up a fuss and make a big deal of it and you should get in...I did. Go harass them at the ticket office and ask to speak to a manager. We had the same issue at the Colosseum, but they knew what to do and they used another ticket to get the turnstile working for us, because their scanners weren't reading properly (the Colosseum tickets will also get you into the Palestine Hill and Forums....you have 2 or 3 days to use the ticket for the other venues.

It's easy to see why this was the area chosen by the earliest settlers. From here you also have great views of the rest of Rome.

This is one of those examples. My first recommendation: bring a bottle of water since you will walk at least one hour. There is a drinking water fountain outside of the metro station that you can refill your bottle, very convenient. My second recommendation is don't wear your brand new white tennis shoes for this visit. You will walk through sandy alleys all over the place. One good thing about this place, it's that the queue is short and you can buy the ticket for this place AND the Colosseum as well. The stroll begins with a big gate entrance beautifully carved. You will find descriptions of every building and the ones that were once there. In my personal opinion, it's better to read ahead before the visit rather than take a tour. I forget very easy the information from the tours, that's why I prefer the books. The descriptions explain the particular building and don't give you the overall explanation of the place. Wear something comfy. I didn't see bathrooms but I saw people selling water bottles. There is a hill facing the Colosseum that you can take the best photos for the Colosseum.If this review was helpful, please click below.

There is so much history in the buildings and our guide Amber did an amazing job explaining everything to us. My advice is do all three on a tour or you'll never get all the great information we did. Go early in the morning! Our tour ended at 1pm on Palatine Hill and I was glad because it was so hot! I couldn't imagine just starting the tour at that time. You cannot say you've seen Rome if you haven't seen where it all began!"

You can walk through the the rooms of their palaces (some imagination required) and see where they played !, look down on and decided on the outcome of millions if distant peoples lives.A full day is required to absorb the hill and its superb history. Bring a packed lunch and water (bottles can be freely refilled at the many fountains around the complex but food is not available), if its hot wear a hat and good walking shoes are essential.The shop at the entrance has a supply of books and paraphernalia but they could do with selling a single sheet plan of the complex to help plan your route.

Forum is at same site so you just follow the path downhill (a good reason to start at the Palatine entrance) to see this.

Wow! We were in for over 2hrs wandering here and there and would probably have stayed longer had we been able to find some refreshment but none seemed to be available anywhere within the bounds of the Palatine or the Roman Forum, had we know this before entering we would have taken something with us and had a bit of a picnic whilst appreciating the ancient monuments. This really was one of our highlights of a 3 day visit and we would rate it above the Sistine chapel!"

Palatine Hill was extremely beautiful and we enjoyed looking at all of the ruins left and the old pieces of marble flooring, overall a very quiet and relaxing morning with all of the blossom, orange trees and views from the top. I would suggest taking a water bottle with you - there are fountains around so you can keep filling up - as you get very hot in the sun but there are shady spots too! The view from the top is stunning and you can see over The Forum, see the Colosseum and the basilicas across the city! Gorgeous!"

There's less people up there, and the palatial ruins are for the most part still-standing; you get a much better sense of scale and purpose than from the rubble in the Forum! And there's a very long, very cool tunnel to walk through if you get too hot. ;) The views from Palatine Hill are amazing - there's a corner overlooking the Colosseum that does not seem well-known, the corner looking over the Forum that everyone goes to (and for good reason - don't miss that view!), and then on the back side, a view over Circus Maximus and Aventine Hill in the distance, which is really quite special and gives you a sense of what it would have been like to be standing in the palace overlooking Circo Massimo. :) I think Palatine Hill is underrated. I wasn't expecting anything much, based on the reviews, and it turned out that I enjoyed it more than the Forum, which I never would have guessed. It also has large enough open stretches that would allow kids to run amok in, which might be a good tip for parents trying to expend some energy in their children. :) (Not tested, just a hunch)."

Once you use the ticket for a particular place, you may not return. We knew that. However, we did not know that the Palatine Hill and Forum are considered one place! We returned the next day and were told we already used the ticket. We explained that we saw a separate way leading to the Forum and thought it was a third entry. (I am a senior and partially disabled and could walk no more after the Coliseum and Palatine Hill.) The ticket entry young woman was sympathetic but could do nothing. This was a \"once in a lifetime trip\" for us for so I told her I understood but it was a disappointment. As we readied to leave, I saw the ticket booth empty(a very rare occurrence I believe) and decided to ask the ticket woman if there was anything we could do. She allowed us entry and I could have hugged her! Never will I forget her kindness. HOWEVER, do not let this happen to you. Palatine Hill and Forum are one.  Do go and wander and soak in the beauty, the history and the views from everywhere. Do some pre research to enjoy the most and do not skip the little museum inside the Palatine.  We did not realize how much there was to see. Plan to stay a while, so bring a snack and water. Use the available WC's when you can because there are few and sometimes long lines(the out of the way ones are a better bet).  Try to go in the morning if visiting in the warmer months. It got very hot in the afternoons. It is also less crowded early."

It is far less crowded comparing to Colosseum entrance and you get a very nice view from the hill to the Colosseum too before going inside, also great city views.

Just walk past the colosseum entrance past the arch of Constatine and it is on your right."

As with the Colosseum, there is minimal signage and nearly no information available about what you are looking at, except for the hired audio guide, or if you are part of a tour. It is a large area and takes a good 2-3 hours to see, if you want to take it all in. The worst part is that there is absolutely NO catering offered within the site! If you are with small children who need to eat, then you will be forced to cut your visit short. We asked nicely, and the security allowed my wife to exit briefly to purchase snacks from the over-priced burger van outside and we picnicked in the grounds. It was unclear whether picnics were allowed. I feel like the gardeners tolerated picnics from the few people who had food with them, but I can imagine that it can quickly get out of hand and this is probably why they do not offer food for sale within the site. Overall, and nice visit, but I would take some food and plan to spend the whole day there if you want to see it properly."

Do the colosseum first and upon exit walk towards the back of the colosseum to palatine hill near the old viaduct ruins. This is a shorter, shallower climb to the top of the hill where you look over the remaining ruins and Rome. It's amazing what they built and how they lived and the infrastructure in place 2000 years ago. My husband and my 4 year old found it fascinating too. If you don't like crowds or extreme heat then mid season is ideal to visit."

Otherwise, you'll see lots of brick walls, ceilings, half destroyed marble statues and columns and most likely will get bored. Hit the museums instead. HOWEVER, for fans of Ancient History, ROME is a must see and study, walk around and TAKE YOUR TIME to admire their building skills for palaces, meeting rooms, temples, statues, baths etc etc etc."

I bought a guide book from the Colosseum bookshop but could have picked a better one with more pictures. Mine was informative enough to get me through and it wasn't expensive either. We spent about 4 hours (easy) touring all the different ruins trying to figure out the palace and what it would have looked like. I'm a huge ancient history lover so it was tons of fun for me. There were a decent amount of signs around the palace area which was nice. Best part had to be the water fountains that were everywhere, which were so convenient to fill your water bottles up. We went in December so it wasn't too hot, but I could see how in the summer months you could want lots of water and good clothes since you'll be exposed to the sun for most of the day. It never felt crowded since the hill is so big which was nice. There are bathrooms around the hill and maps all around to point you in the right direction. For non history buffs, a couple of hours should be enough to get a good idea of the hill and its importance in Roman History. The price in included with your Colosseum ticket!"

A young American asked us if we wanted to take a tour for $10 that would allow us to skip the line, his company was called Royal Crown tours. The tour was informative and we learned a lot about both Palatine Hill, the Coliseum and the Forum that I feel we wouldn't have learned had we not taken the tour. It isn't very long but its only $10 a person so you get what you pay for. A warning, we were taking the stairs up to Palatine Hill when two men tried to pick pocket my wife and I.

This ticket allowed full access for one day to the Roman Forum, the Colosseum and Palatine Hill. Our taxi dropped us off on Via San Gregorio, outside the entrance to Palatine Hill. This place was deserted and we walked right in without having to wait in any sort of queue.Palatine Hill houses a museum showcasing artefacts that were found in the vicinity, which has interesting video presentations. Admission is free.Most sites are signposted in Italian and French, with brief but good information. Was delighted at having seen the supposed dwelling place of the founder of Rome: Romulus. Palatine Hill offers beautiful panoramic views of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum. The Forum is connected to the hill and you just continue walking around the grounds. You'll need to exit the forum to cross the road to reach the Colosseum. Allow at least 4 hours to see everything, whilst walking at an average pace. 90% of footpaths are cobbled stones, so appropriate footwear is advised. There are no shops nearby, so I recommend carrying a bottle of water."

Go early (9am) and buy the ticket at the Palatine Hill/Roman forum, because the lines are shorter there. The say the tickets are good for two days, but make no mistake, you can use them only one time at each attraction. You can spend 2 hours at the colosseum and certainly 3 to 4 hours at the Palatine, so plan your day to go first to one of them, have lunch and go to the other. This is because you will walk a lot and get tired, so it is good to rest while eating a nice meal. The best restaurants around are at Cavour street."

It may not have the same visual impact of the other two, but it has a much more relaxed atmosphere. You don't have to wait in a big line to get in, and the people around you seem calmer. Once in it is a large site that was green and cool when I visited (Feb 2015) but in the Summer I would be sure to bring some sun protection and water. There are fountains to fill bottles. Another point to note is that it is a hilly area and had a fair few stairs. Still the lack of rush means you can take your time to work your way up there. Plenty of signage in Italian and English offering information about what you are seeing. Highly recommended - even if you race through (would be a shame though) it allows you to skip the lines at the other venues."

But viewing without paying the fee makes you wonder what its all about, so if you do have time and want to learn more about Roman life, go in and check it out. Worth it. There are also guides hanging around that will tell you about life gone by. There was a Uni student keen to earn a few dollars and we went with her. Not sure it was legal, but we had a fascinating insight into it all."

At the same time the queue to cash desk in Colosseum was terrible long.Palatine Hill is quite huge area with lots of the remains of old buildings. To understand these ruins its good start your visit from the museum. You can watch there a video that shows how the hill was changing, who was the owner, what he built and in which place. After watching that movie walk through the Palatine Hill is completely different. No guidebook will explain so clearly the history of the hill as it is shown with use of animations in the movie.From the viewing terrace on the Palatine Hill is a beautiful view on the Roman Forum, the Colosseum and Rome. Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum is one area. After visiting the hill you should walk down to the Roman Forum. These ruins are making a much larger impression than on the Palatine. Definitely it's a place that you must see in Rome.After visiting Palatine Hill and Roman Forum you need to exit this area and you can go to the Colosseum. Ticket is valid two days so you can go to Colosseum on the next day if you want. Having already ticket you don't need to wait in the queue to cash desk in Colosseum, you can go straight to the entrance gates (there is no queue)."

This will help you understand more about the history and the old remains of the sites you are visiting. We had a great guide but sometimes when the 4-hour tour can be very exhausting. Take lots of photos. Make sure you bring water and wear comfortable shoes as you go through the old Roman roads and climb steps can wear you down.

Although the palaces were denuded of their marble by the papal architects in the 1500s and left to rot you can still get an idea of their splendour and size, particularly after seeing the exhibitions inside the excellent little museum inside the site. We continued past the outline of the original Romulus hut and down towards the forum and the Senate. Wow. To see where Cicero spoke....well you get the picture. Such a great place to visit.

You can have excellent view of Colosseum and rest of Rome from the hill and there are many ruins, palace on the hill as well.In order to reduce the distress many tourists suffered, I\u2019d like to recommend following to Italian Tourism Ministry.1) Although Italy as a whole is very friendly and welcoming tourists, there are many websites posing as \u201cofficial.\u201d They overcharge entrance fees, tickets and worse, you cannot get actual tickets when you arrive. Another scam is they gave wrong information like you need entrance fee on everything although some sites are free. Since, one need to register even to use free wifi at airport in Italy and rest of Europe. So why don\u2019t they take actions on those scammers giving a bad name to Italy.2) Need to punish \u201cgreedy\u201d gladiators. Very well-known trip to target na\u00efve tourists who did not do homework. Yes, those tourists should indeed blame themselves more for being idiots but gladiators should also be punished if they threaten to get like 100 euros. May be 10 euros should be like a maximum and once gladiators cross a line, tourists should be able to inform some policeman to take action."

There might be a goodlooking perfectly englishspeaking guy selling you the tickets, and when everything is settled, he shows you to your group -which could be a group of a guide who thinks he is funny, and simply ruins the whole trip, because he is moody and you simply dont understand a word he is saying. You just want to leave. However, if you want to get in forum romanum, you havr to stick to the group. What to do? Walk around by yourself, take your pictures, but keep limited distance from your guide, so you still can get in to the Forum. Otherwise, it really. Was interesting, despite the cheaters"

What is amazing and moving is the huge Cross that stands on the main platform which brought down not only the pagan government of Rome, but was the force behind ending the evil threats against humans and beasts for entertainment purposes.

I had done some reading in a Rick Steves Guide beforehand, which I'd also brought along - so I knew what some of the main points of interest were. However, I also had my toddler strapped to me and that interfered a little with the reading along. There was a lot here, more than I could take in! This place is best savored. By the time we got here, we were pretty tired out from the Colosseum and the Forum, so we didn't see the museum or all of the sites that were here.Of interest here are the ruins of the Imperial Palace (quite sobering to see site of the former throne - was once the seat of the most powerful Empire on earth and is now basically a field with wildflowers and some crumbling remains), a view of Circus Maximus. This hill is also the legendary site where Remus and Romulus supposedly washed up. If you don't do some homework beforehand (or get a good guide), you'll likely be a bit confused and wonder what's so important about all these old remains. Even now I'm finding out things that I missed and wish I'd paid more attention to!We forgot water bottles - it was October, so thankfully not as bad as it could have been, but still pretty rough. There are fountains throughout the place, but they are very hard to drink from without a bottle. Tickets to the Colosseum/Roman Forum include this site, so don't overlook it!"

It's amazing to see all the places from the stories and imaging Julius Caesar stomping about ;-)Make sure you allow plenty of time - I would say at least three hours in total, but ideally more. The labelling and info onsite is very poor, so it's worth doing a bit of swotting up before you go - a lot of guidebooks (Lonely Planet) have a map with the key buildings marked. Look out for the temple of the vestals and the temple of Castor and Pollux - they look great in photos. Be careful not to miss the temple to Julius Caesar (only the inner section remains) and if you're looking for the Senate (Curia) it's the poorly marked big square building in the back right corner, past the Forum, as you enter from the Palatine.My favourite bit is the decorated pillar foot that marks the official centre of Rome (from where all distances were measured) that stands just to the right of the imposing pillars of the Temple of Saturn.

The audio-guide then directs you towards the souvenir shop! Then you're directed downstairs for a very short walk. And that's it. Extremely disappointing. As one lady already pointed out here, the toilets are pretty crap and disgusting. We took our baby in the buggy, and it was grand, as there's a lift to go to the top level.

Plus, if you walk to the end of the Palatine hill nearest the Colosseum you get the best view of the Colosseum without any crowds being in your way like you do at ground level, and for some reason most people don't seem to be bothered with making this very short walk so it's quieter too."

There were seven of us, and it was great to get such personal attention. That is the way to go!! Anyways, to be walking where people walked many thousand years ago is awe inspiring. It really helped me get a grip as to how the people lived back then. Our tour guide Julia was very informative. She filed in the blanks on the Roman's traditions and food, clothing, where they shopped, etc. . She also filled us in on the \"layers\" of Rome. She said the oldest layers to the newest were piled like lasagna. She used that phrase a lot. You can see where the levels of Rome were built on top of each other. To see where Rome was founded, to see where Julius Caesar's body was supposedly burned was thought provoking. Unless you are a history professor ( or married to one), get a guide. It was worth the money we spent. We did not waste any time and saw most if not all of the Roman Forum. Being a history buff it really worked well for my group. There are many vendors in the area selling food, water, and drinks. There are also many restaurants within a couple block walk of this site. During our time there a policeman announced over a loud speaker that pickpockets were in the area. It was broadcast in about 3 or 4 languages. That was very much appreciated. Lastly our guide was able to direct us to a fabulous restaurant about 5 blocks away from the Forum. A guide is the way to go. They also provided transportation from our hotel and back."

However, there is more than only walking around or only a quick walk inside. I would recommend one of those tours that will bring you to the higher levels and to the underground (as long as it's not flooded). That is quite a good journey through the history of gladiators, executions, celebrations and death. And that would be a good advixe: check the forecast before going. It's not rare that they will close the place due rain."

This is an extensive site, which on reflection I should have prepared better for by reading up on it, because all my preconceptions about where the Roman hierarchy lived and actual size of the buildings was just plain wrong. Some were immense. What I was amazed by was how they built their villas to overlook Circus Maximus, drink a wine and watch the races. Nothing's changed!Message for the curators : What I would have liked to see is a diagram at each point showing what the building looked like. The Baths of Carracella have a picture showing what it was like compared to what it is now, and are an excellent visual reference, which made the site come alive and more than another ruin. When so little remains of some buidings it would make it more enjoyable.Also, your toilets at the entrance need an urgent upgrade: flush buttons were so hard to push that I cannot describe here what I saw there. Appalling. There was also a queue. One should not have to wait!PS If anyone sees the busker playing classical guitar up the hill from the ticket office in the quiet lane on the way to the church, please buy his CD. I just got back yesterday and played it for the first time. I'd love to know how to get in touch to let him know how enjoyable it is to listen to."

I cant imagine walking around here in the middle of summer crowds in 40+ degrees though... Again I wont go on and on about the historical aspects, lots of other people are more qualified to do that. A couple of survival tips - you can spend hours here, so there are several water fountains throughout so dont worry that you will run out of water (very civilised - some other cities I could mention should be so courteous to their visitors instead of charging 2-3 euros for a bottle of water). I only found one set of toilets in the centre but they are there, so dont worry about rushing your visit. I took my lunch in with me and had a nice picnic and took my time through the ruins. Again buy your ticket online, only short queues here but just easier than having to line up and you can swipe yourself straight through the barrier. As many others have said - wear good walking shoes. This is not the day to try out your new stylish Italian heels!!! You will twist an ankle if you do - huge cobblestones everywhere and very dusty and uneven under foot."

The hill is larger, and has more shady spots and can take bathroom/shade break inside the museum. Bring your own bottles of ice water, and can refill at the various running water spots. Bring a sun hat or wear a wetted bandana to stay cool. Wear good shoes, ground is rough, and/or dusty. Then take a break for late afternoon lunch nearby, and tour the Colosseum near sunset, for stunning photos and views in the golden light.

Both visits were great. This is a fascinating place to visit. There is no better place or way to get a glimpse into ancient Rome. I strongly suggest, that if you can, that you visit this area with a good tour guide, as we did, as the guides can make ancient Rome come to life before your eyes. However, don't feel the need to buy the skip the line tours (especially the ones out on the streets) as the morning we went back to visit - in peak season and peak time of day - there was no line to skip, we just bought tickets and walked right in."

Its like a huge park in the middle of a bustling city..but this is a park with a difference. Roman ruins everywhere and a museum in the centre with lots of information about the site. You could spend hours here as the paths lead off in different areas. It was hot when we went and after walking for hours around Rome we cut short our visit. Hilly uneven walk and plenty of steps dotted about so wear good walking shoes. Lots of guided tours going on along the route. If we had had more time it would have been good to join one of these as there is so much to learn about the site. We took some interesting pictures though and got a real feel for what ancient Rome would have been like. My advice- take a sandwich and a cool drink. Relax under one of the beautiful trees and just take in the views for a while inbetween your trek. We kind of rushed round which is a shame as there was so much to see. If you aren't pushed for time join a guided tour. The ones we passed sounded very informative and interesting."

I was never able to find just one app/site that had everything I wanted so I ended up with an assortment of apps depending on which site I was visiting.

Not being religious, and being very interested in understanding the story of the times in that place, I asked that our guide take us and go into as much detail as possible.Upon seeing the Menorah from the temple in the arch, I uncontrollably broke down crying as if I'd just lost my entire family.

The ruins of the historic heart of the empire and the emperor\u2019s palace are incredible to see and to be able to wander down the Sacred Way and stand where emperors, senators, consuls, legionaries and ordinary romans walked was a highlight. There is a lot to see but don\u2019t miss the Temple of the Vestals. There are some houses that you can enter, but these were closed during our visit \u2013 it seems odd but the authorities seem to delight in closing key sites during the height of the tourist season.Don\u2019t bother with a guided tour as you can always \u201coverhear\u201d the guides talking to other groups. You should be able to get an audio guide but they seem to have too few to meet the demand.It can take a long time to walk round \u2013 we found it took 6 hours to see everything properly. There are toilets and water fountains with cool drinkable water, and you may find unofficial water sellers offering bottles of solid ice at a reasonable price \u2013 these slowly melt and are very welcome. Remember to take hats and sunscreen as it can be very hot and you will want to find shaded areas regularly. The streets and paths are uneven so not recommended if you are in a wheelchair or have walking difficulties. I did see one wheelchair user being really shaken about as she was pushed around by her carer.The big problem \u2013 as with many places in Rome - is the tour guides who have all adopted the practice of having coloured \u201cflags\u201d on top of high sticks which constantly get in the way when you are trying to admire a view or take a photo.Your ticket lasts for 2 days and also covers the Colosseum so its good value at about EUR 12. One note \u2013 you can only enter each site once on the ticket, which is a shame as it would have been better to be able to do half the Forum then come back again.Watch your map for the exits \u2013 just because you came in at a location doesn't mean you can also leave that way!If you love Roman history this should be high on your list to visit."

If you have an option to do something like this, I'd definitely recommend it. It was a great way to spend the afternoon. The site itself is about 10-15 feet lower than the current level of streets in Rome, due to thousands of years of dirt and sediment, so there's a slight downhill walk. Great place for history buffs to look around and get a sense of Ancient Rome."

The ruins are so rich with history, I would recommend doing a little research before going so you have an idea of what you are looking at. This is my second time here and we decided to get the audio guide. Here is a tip. If you get the audio guide ignore the numbers on the map. There are no numbers to coincide with them in the forum or Palatine. There are, however, signs that say what you are looking at and you can cross reference those with the map. Even then it's still really confusing. The information is great you just don't know what the audio guide is referring to half the time. I would go with what other people have said and download a podcast or just read the signs. Also, if you do get an audioguide you have to leave an ID. This place is HUGE with many exits so if you just wanted to exit where you are, let's say Palatine Hill, you can't. You have to walk all the way back to the beginning to return them. Bring water it can get hot and enjoy your afternoon walking through history!!"

If you have any interest in history in general or Roman history specifically, you should not go anywhere near Rome without seeing this. Go early in the morning, when the ticket office first opens (8:30 when we were there). Buy your ticket at Palantine, not at the Coliseum (you can get tickets for both there, and do the Coliseum later without standing in line). We arrived at 8:30 and were literally second in line. We had the grounds almost to ourselves for a couple hours, which is enough to pretty well see it. It's also cooler in the morning. Take your camera. You will be walking from Caesar's house to his gardens, to the forum, complete with temples and government buildings. There is a delight at every turning. They have done a remarkable job of excavating, but not restoring or otherwise adding modern touches to these structures. It's a tremendous experience for a fraction of the admission price to most attractions in Rome. We enjoyed it even more than the Coliseum across the street. Don't miss it!"

As a tour guide he is outstanding making all the ruins come to life, a witty sense of humour and has really excellent tips on how to make the most out of a stay in Rome including how to avoid the queues at the popular attractions.I ended up on David's tour as I chose to spend 15 euros on a guided colosseum tour. That tour was not exciting but David collected our tour group after we exited the Colosseum for the 2nd half of our tour of the ruins. Best 15 euros I ever spent!The tour of the Palatine Hill was great although taking all those stairs on a hot day is not a good idea. If you are not fit or not confident on stairs- alert the tour guide as there is a ramp to the top of the hill. The forum was excellent although you don't get a paper map to help you work out which ruin is which.David also ran an evening walking tour (25 euros) where he took us under a church to really see Ancient Roman street level as well as visits to the River Tiber, the Jewish Ghetto, several fountains by Bernini and a look at the outside of the Pantheon. Both of his tours have an easy pace with plenty of opportunities to sit down in the location he is describing.website: www.roman-days.com"

No organisation no information, just about 100-150 people bunched in front of windows with ticket officers sitting talking to each other. After about 20 minutes and a few angry customers we were then informed that only 1,000 people were allowed in at any time and that was why we were waiting. I don't mind to wait but keep the customer informed...saves a lot of tension and disgruntled customers"

This also meant we had a guide to improve our knowledge and enhance our journey through both these impressive historical landmarks. Our guide for the Colosseum was good and we did learn quite a lot but when we got handed over to our guide for the forum things really stepped up a few notches. The guide, David Battagliano was not only extremely knowledgeable but the ease at which he imparted it made it so enjoyable and made the heat almost bearable. His sense of humour, wit and slight sarcastic slant on life was a welcome change to the usual tour guide, but most of all his tips and helpful hints about Rome were invaluable. He made such an impression on us that we actually went on a further 2 tours with him. One, an evening walking tour of Rome, which was brilliant but the best was the day trip to Ariccia where we went to Angelos Osteria and had a pasta making course and then ate what we had made (plus lots more) not to mention the wine. Our fabulous day ended with a visit to a lovely park overlooking Rome which was filled with orange trees, the smell of which was amazing.

Nonetheless, the Forum is an impressive location with many fascinating features, you can feel how the area used to look.Palatine Hill is a fair walk, especially in the August heat, luckily there are plentiful water fountains located around the main pathways. There are some excellent views of the Forum and the Colosseum also.Well worth a visit, especially if you have been to the Colosseum and have access anyway."

The bathrooms are poorly maintained and smell horrible. There are no places to get water or food once inside. The water fountain water is not drinkable, although others out of desperation were filling up their water bottles with the water. On a hot day, the site is sweltering with very little shade. It can be a test of persons patience and resiliency. Often it is too crowded and the tour groups all compete with each other to see who can get to the bathrooms first. Expect to stand almost the whole time. Handicapped persons will have a very difficult, if not impossible, time getting around."

It's free if you go on the first Monday of every month for some reason and there's so much history to take in that you could spend all day here.Fortunately once you are inside the gates you are also protected from the hoards of thieves and scam artists lurking around outside. Be very wary of the locals. They're thoroughly unpleasant at best and downright dishonest. Even the state will try to rob from you at every turn with fines for everything including the common scam on the trains. Fail to 'validate' your ticket at a second (usually hidden and always unsigned) machine in the station before you leave and you'll be hit with a minimum of \u20ac50 fine despite having the correct ticket with the dates and journey clearly stamped on it!!!! They caught 3 other groups in the same carriage as us and almost every tourist we spoke to had been hit with this. After a couple of days of having to queue twice at public transport hubs for this nonsense, fighting off the scam artists and thieves plus seeing the miserable, unhappy faces of the locals glowering at the very people who bring so much money into their failing state I'd tell anyone thinking of a trip to Rome to really think again and choose a more welcoming destination instead."

If you do buy a ticket, it will give you access to the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill and the Colosseum, whereas the Roma Pass does not also provide access for the Colosseum unless you still have attractions left on your pass to use.Make sure you get to the top of the hill to see a beautiful view of Rome!"

My family took a whole day to experience the Roman Forums, Palatine Hill and the Coliseum (we bought tickets online and are so glad we did, bypassed the queue and went straight in). Palatine Hill took much longer than I expected. It is much larger than I expected with paths going off in all directions. Don't miss the archway towards the old vineyard. At the top is a lovely view of the Coliseum and surrounding areas. We also queued to see Augustus' house (Cassa di Augustus), and although it was amazing to witnesses frescoes from over 2000 years ago, not sure I would queue again just to see 3 old rooms. It was very hot, and an uncomfortable slopped queue. Lots of walking, so make sure you are wearing comfortable walking shoes. I wore my flip flops, and what with all the uneven surfaces, stones, cobbles, dust, etc, in hindsight, my feet got a definite work out, and got very dirty. Also, once you are inside, there are no shops to purchase water, food or other refreshments, so make sure you take water and a few bits to munch on. There are a few water fountains to fill up your bottles, so you can stay hydrated at least. Enjoy!"

There is quite a climb up to the top of the Palatine, but it is worth it once there. The Palatine Hill takes up quite a large area and the preservation of the buildings is quite good (much better than the Forum). We managed to get into the House of Augustus and it is stunning. It really is a miracle that the painted walls have survived in such a good state for the best part of 2000 years. The views over Rome from the top of the Palatine are superb and well worth the climb. There is a path leading down into the Forum or vice versa if you started in the Forum. The Forum is not as well preserved as the Palatine Hill and it is largely just ruins now, however there are 2 Ceremonial Arch's and several columns still standing. Taking the Colosseum, Palatine Hill and the Forum altogether, the whole area is a must see and well worth the time and effort."

We prefer wandering at our own pace so we are not fans of, or have ever done, a guided tour but know many people prefer them for the additional insights you may get from the guide. We do use phone apps that we've found or podcasts that I've downloaded as we walk through the sites.I think it would be impossible to walk through these sites and not wonder what life must have been like almost 2000 years ago when it was first built or how they even managed to build it at all. From the relics of old palaces on the Palatine, to the Forum, which was the commercial center of ancient Rome, to the majestic Colosseum, the history of ancient Rome comes alive and you find yourself immersed in thought, \"what would it have been like?\". Been to Rome several times around Thanksgiving and once in September and I much prefer the Thanksgiving time period. September was really hot and still very crowded - almost too hot to enjoy the city, with all the walking and outdoor places to see. Thanksgiving was less crowded (although I don't think there is really a time when there aren't a lot of people visiting) but, most of all, it was cooler. Temperatures around 55-60 during the day so doing all that walking and touring was much more enjoyable.Love Rome, one of my very favorite cities....."

Lots of ruins to look at as well as nice shady grassy areas to sit down for a rest.It was nice to walk around and there is a good view of the Colosseum from the far end.If you are short on time and wanting to see ruins, I would recommend visiting the Roman Forum over Palatine Hill."

While the lines to enter the Coliseum are endless, and the are bustling crowds try to enter the Forum, Palatine Hill is less crowded which can make the sightseeing experience much more pleasurable even in the summer tourist season. There are great views from this vista and plenty of old palace ruins to explore. Though it can be hot in the summer heat, there are fountains available where one can get water for free to cool off. It is from her that one will be able to view the Circus Maximus in much the same way as Rome's distant Emperor's once did. There are also beautiful botanic gardens here (a legacy of from Rome's Emperor's) as well a views of the Forum below. I would recommend one first explore Palatine Hill before descending below into the Forum which will more than likely be packed with tourist and sometimes difficult to navigate if you want to take your time and soak it all in at a leisurely pace. Save the Coliseum for last as your ticket to get you into Palatine Hill will allow you to skip the long lines to enter the Coliseum."

The amount of history contained within this area is fascinating. Excavations are ongoing meaning that the area is continuously evolving. There is a lot of walking over uneven ground - so not very suitable for disabled access. We would definitely return - next time we would do more homework about the significant historical characters involved in the development of this area way back when. Don't miss the view of the Circus Maximus and imagine watching the chariots!

I don't know if you can by separate tickets for Palatine Hill and the forum, there were kiosks outside the entrance. If it is possible ques for just these attractions were very small but if you want to visit the Colosseum as well I recommend booking tickets online in advance. We arrived quite early and still queued for an hour and a half.I had not idea how big Palatine Hill was, we had driven past it the day before and had heard the views over the city were beautiful. We made our way up, but the site itself is stunning. Although \"only\" ruins remain of the huge palaces they still show the quality of the building work which leaves you stunned. Repeatedly heard \"This is amazing\" from other tourists on the site as well as ourselves. Leaves you feeling quite humbled and linked to ancient civilisations, apparently 2000 years isn't that long! There are old cobbles (I don't know if they are original but they look pretty old) they are quite uneven, also a lot of the paths are just dirt which gets very dry in the summer. I wore cheap sandals and was ok but my feet were filthy. Make sure you were smart shoes esp if you are unsteady on your feet. There are plenty of places to sit so although its a big site if you have problems walking you can take breaks. All the kids there seemed to be having lots of fun as well. Give yourself time to see the whole site along with the Roman Forum which is within the same site. The Colosseum provides much more shade than this area so I would recommend seeing the Colosseum first and then Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum in the late afternoon when the weather has cooled. We spent all day seeing just these three and I would have gladly spent longer. When you enter the site Palatine Hill is left of the first arch, if you visit this first you can walk back down and visit the forum. You can exit the forum and see the Altare della Patria which is just the most OTT building ever (some call it the 'typewritter' which it does look like!) Enjoy!"

I think they're trying to keep in touch with ancient times but not accepting anything but a piece of paper for a ticket. Anyway.... The tour we had wasn't the best. It was a series of short speeches punctuated but walking in the sun. When it finished most people commented that they thought there would be more to it. The night visit, the tour of the top tier and the dungeons are all meant to be worthwhile. It's a pleasant place to sit out in the evening watching the hawkers trying to sell their wares. A top Rome tip - there are two places outside the Metro where you can get fresh drinking water. Save yourself from carrying big bottles and please save yourself from buying a bottle from a hawker (I have a feeling they use the free water and re-seal the bottles- not at all hygienic to re-use bottles). If you've got an iPhone there are apps that show the approx 2,500 fountains' location."

Building materials were just left scattered all around ruins, wet bags of cement were resting against the pillars, iron bars hidden in the thick weeds growing all around. Honestly this looked like the most slap dash renovation job I have ever seen! the sort of thing you see on TV when they expose dodgy builders!Albeit I went in January, the down season, the place was still full of paying tourists from all around the world. And to see some of the most important history of the world being ruined was utterly disheartening. Italy should be ashamed!"

We were able to have some drinks & ice-creams but those Romans of 2000 years ago-I wonder what they had to keep cool.

I prefer to research and visit on my own first - as I like to get the \"feel\" of it without having to hang on to the words of the guide - then, when I return, I will hire a guide. If you do not have this luxury, try hiring a private guide if you can, or, a small tour - if you go with a large tour - you might as well just read a book and go on your own. My opinion. there is a lot to see and learn and you will NOT do it in one visit. I have been to these areas many times and will always find out something new or see something new or there are new excavations (Domus Aurea area is one example - Nero's Golden House was huge and covered a great area).

You can get a two day ticket which allows you to see the Palatine, the Forum, and the Colosseum with a chance to soak it all in. I think a lot of people skip the Palatine, which would be a mistake. That's where the rich Romans lived, and chunks of their mansions, one with part of a marble floor intact, are still there. It is breezy even on a hot Roman day. The very earliest remains of the huts of Romulus are there as well. A huge athletic field is sunken behind what was one of the mansions. Go down hill to the Forum and you have another experience altogether. It is harder to imagine what it was like when intact- the multi story structures that once existed have been reduced in size. Archaeological digs were still ongoing when we visited . The Italians continue it make new discoveries."

My suggestion is to visit the Colosseo, Palatine and the Foro on the same day, and end the afternoon with a visit to the Capitoline Museum. Personally, I opted to visit all three sites with a tour guide because I was interested in the historical aspects behind them. These three sites were definitely in my favorite top 10 - they are all remarkably well-preserved and just bloody awesome! If you're a photographer like me, then you will find plenty of photo opps here. DO remember to go to Palatine Hill - it's beautiful up there and there are plenty of ruins to check out. Palatine is quite a large area so make sure you're wearing comfortable shoes. I wore my Birks because I just could bring myself to wear runners in the intense heat, but be warned - you're much likelier to sprain an ankle wearing sandals than you are wearing runners! Anyway, I really enjoyed visiting this site - there are many ruins scattered throughout, and you will find one of the best views of the Colosso from one very specific vantage point (be sure to keep an eye out for it as you start walking up). You will also find great views of the Forum as well as Circo Massimo."

We have been to Palatine Hill many times but this is the first time we \"discovered\" the frescoes in the house of Emperor Augustus. We followed a school group who knew where they were going, then we realized there frescoes which have been on view since 2008. You can only look in the door at the frescoes because they are fragile and they only allow a handful of people to enter at one time. It is well worth the wait. The frescoes are vibrantly colored and beautiful.I would suggest visiting the Forum and Palatine Hill before the Colosseum since the same ticket allows entry in to the Colosseum and you can skip the queue if you already have your ticket.

This place is worth a visit definitely, but what is left does not do justice to what it must have been like when it was all intact. Huge columns, arches etc are all so immense, these Romans really were great builders! Palatine Hill is not so great, but worth the climb to see the colosseum from the top. The ticket includes the colosseum so no queueing!"

And it is such a large site and visually uninterrupted by the modern ( except the museum, which tries to blend and does a reasonably good job at it ), that it adds to the feeling.Unfortunately, it was late when we started the Palatine Hill and we wanted to see the Colosseum before it closed, so that all we saw of the Forum was from the Palatine Hill, itself. What we could see looked great and made us sad as we knew we wouldn't get to see it, as we were leaving Rome the next day. It was just one of many places on the itinerary we had to excise due to time constraints. I used to get upset when we wouldn't see everything I planned. Maybe I'm getting older or just realistic, but this time I took it in stride. Besides it's easier to accept when what you do see is so spectacular that you are in a perpetual state of awe."

The line is very short; it allows you to bypass the lines at the forum and Colosseum, which is always very long. The entrance is just up the hill from the Colosseum entrance. I enjoy Palatine Hill because it is a quiet, tranquil area in the midst of the usually overcrowded forum and Colosseum area. It is full of gardens and ruins. A peaceful, relaxed walk through the Palatine Hill area prepares you for you entrance into the crowd at the Roman Forum, which can be entered directly from Palatine Hill and then the Colosseum entrance is just across the street from the exit from the Roman Forum area. As you walk past the very long line waiting to buy tickets at the Colosseum, you will be very glad you have your ticket and can walk straight into the Colosseum."

Wear comfortable shoes.3. Bring a few bottles of water."

One thing I would mention though is that it would be difficult to get around with a pushchair/buggy or in a wheelchair or if you are not too good on your legs or don't like climbing slopes, as the whole area is very uneven and on a number of levels. We wanted to see the Palatine Museum too but unfortunately it closed at around 12.30 because Barack Obama was visiting the Colosseum next to it and all areas around the site were closed for security purposes( I've never seen so many police in one place, let alone armed police with helicopters circling overhead!!) I would loved to have been able to spend a couple more hours here and if it wasn't our last day in Rome today I would go back tomorrow to see what I missed but I suppose it gives me the excuse to visit Rome again but if I do I must remember to consult with Mr Obama's diary to make sure our sightseeing trips don't clash again!"

I would have given this 5 if I had been rating on the historic Forum and Palatine hill itself but I'm afraid the upkeep, signage and management is appalling. Firstly without Trip Advisor city guide we would never have found the entrance. Secondly there are only 2 ticket offices creating I would suppose monumental ( excuse the pun) queues in the peak season. Secondly you need ID to get an audio guide, being a Brit I don't have this unless I carry my passport not a good idea in an area renowned for pick pockets. One post said the audio guide was useless anyway. Thirdly there are no other guide books or maps to buy or any free maps given out. Fourthly there is no obvious way round so it's easy to miss the items of interest, and the signage which is up is wordy. What is so obviously needed are some drawings of how the buildings used to look. All the guides have these little books to show their flocks of tourists my top tip would be to buy your own before you go. The ruins themselves are amazing and some are intact like the senate building which is tucked away and we could have easily missed. This could be a spectacular attraction if managed properly they might take a tip from whoever is running Edinburgh Castle which we visited only a few weeks ago, here we were just handed the audio guides which were excellent for a very reasonable sum.

Unless you have researched extensively, it's hard to tell exactly what you're looking at. Don't get me wrong, the sites are impressive, and there are some parts in particular that are pretty well preserved. For instance, there was one spot where I was walking through a covered passageway and there was an amazing carved ceiling overhead. Look all around, because not many of these things are called out specifically if you don't know they're there! There are a number of signs at the top of the hill where the Flavia Palace is, and that is a must-see if you are in this area. My ticket purchased at the Colosseum also covered admission to the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, so for 12 or 13 EUR, you could spend a half day or more seeing all there is to see in this part of Rome."

For complete detail all the way through that part of the hill from the Colosseum and the forum I think that the entire journey would take more or less than 5-6 hours, but I think to visit every corner of this beautiful piece of history it takes half a day, there is a endless supply of things to see. I think if you wanna get a good knowledge of all the notions is appropriate to hire a guide that will explains everything you need to know from the single altar to the ruins or building.

My husband and I visited via a Walks of Italy tour that combined it with the Roman Forum and Colosseum, so our entrance fee was already covered and the tour allowed us to skip any lines (the tour was the best tour we've ever had, so I highly recommend it as well). It's an incredible experience to visit and feel the presence of another time. And with so much open space, it's not crowded, so very relaxing to take everything in and take amazing photos of the area and city beyond. In our opinion, visiting is a must."

The Palatine was the home of many of the most famous figures of ancient Rome and as such it is hard to stand on any part of the hill and not feel awestruck by your insignificance in the vast scheme of history. You could easily spend a day walking around enjoying the marvellous views of the city of Rome, at one moment you are struck by a view of the dome of Saint Peter's in the distance and then you find yourself looking down to find the ruins of the Forum laid out below you like the pillars and blocks of a child's building set that someone has forgotten to tidy away at the end of playtime. It is a great place for a picnic. It is a confusing site there is no doubt and a good tour guide is probably necessary if you really want to get under the skin of the site. Even without a guide it is possible to feel the very essence of ancient Rome all around you. Augustus and Livia lived here as did Cicero and Mark Anthony and it is even believed that the twins Romulus and Remus were reared here by a wolf. Do not miss the Palatine Antiquarium Museum which is housed in a large building on the site. It is full of artefacts including busts, statues and artwork actually found on the hill and some of these are absolutely stunning."

As with many of the places I visited in Rome, I felt there wasn't enough information given to tourists about the history of the site, which is a shame, so I would suggest maybe looking into a guided tour, just so you can fully appreciate the surroundings. Spent a good few hours here, looking at every nook and cranny, touching everything possible (gently of course) that wasn't roped off, but also, just standing, breathing in the air and imagining life in Ancient Rome. Considering what is left, Palantine Hill is very authentic and makes you able to do so. The buildings are very impressive and makes you appreciate just how creative we are as a species and for how many thousands of years that humans have been able to design and build such beautiful, complex buildings. This could potentially be boring for younger kids, who may be irritable with the lack of shade, so consider in summer going in the afternoon. Also, don't be surprised if your teenage kids don't appreciate it as much as you thought they would; unless they are into culture, then they're more than likely they were on a beach in zante, or some other 'cool' party place. All in all, a great experience and I would have loved to have learnt more about it as I walked around, but luckily, thanks to my free wifi at the hotel I was able to find out evrything I wanted to know about it, when I got home.Don't give this place a miss, and remember, it is included in the collosseo ticket alongside the roman forum"

Do your homework before you fly and gather information before you fly to Rome to make sure you have a reasonable knowledge of the place you'll see and their significant importance. For history buffs, like I am, a very moving visit to the heart of western civilization, not to be missed and to enjoy to the fullest. If you stay in Rome for at least 3 days, use the Roma Pass and get entrance to the nearby Colosseum and Palatine Hill, skipping queues at each."

It is just breathtaking and if you love history, you will not be disappointed. I cannot describe the feeling of being in a place like this. It is a unique experience that I wouldn't trade for anything. It is a a ruin, so not everything is perfectly preserved. However, it seems that every time I come here, a new section of Palantine HillI or the Forum is being conserved or renovated. It is also an archaeological site that frequently has new sections opened up or discovered. So each time I visit, I see a new part that I did not see before. I looked at a lot of the reviews that complained about not getting a map - maps are available with Roma Pass purchase, online, and with many guide books such as Rick Steve's. Rome is not a place to go and just \"wing it\". It is very old and can be confusing. With taking the time to thoroughly check out places we wanted to visit, reserving tickets, and properly planning our time, my husband and I never got lost and came away happy. YES, you do need to keep your belongings close. Pick pockets are a problem. My husband keeps our IDs, money and credit cards in a zippered pouch that he wears around his neck and buttoned inside his shirt."

A prime spot for Roman aristocrats to live for centuries, it became primarily the location for emperors to live starting with Augustus. He lived here for over 40 years in the same modest place he first had when he became emperor. Granted it was more lavishly decorated then the average Roman's, but compared to the emperors who followed him, it was modest indeed. Later a palace was built by Domitian in around 81 AD. Presently there are the extensive remains of later modifications and additions to this area. There is a small museum on the top of the hill that is worth about 30 minutes to go through. For me the highlight of the Palatine is the House of Augustus. You get to view four rooms of the man who had total control of the western world for 45 years. Absolutely check the hours this is open. I was told all day and arrived about 2:00 to find it closed. It appears at present it's only open until 1:30, but only on certain days. The House of Livia (his wife) is closed to the public. There are also some remains they have discovered that date to about 850 BC that support Rome's legends of having been founded in 753 BC. It seems the Colosseum and The Forum get all the press (which they deserve) but do not overlook this fabulous area."

We bought the 12 Euro ticket at the Coliseum and used that for our entry here.We considered hiring a guide, but I've done a lot of reading...travel books and Roman history....so we decided to go it alone. It worked out just fine. I actually carried Rick Steve's Rome book so I had a quick reference to fall back upon when needed.There is so much to see here and so much to \"feel\"....soaking in the sights...thinking of who walked these streets 2000 years ago....and just trying to get deep into the ancient Roman experience.There is much much much to see and take in here. I really don't suggest trying to walk it and just look. Either study up or go with a tour that uses headsets so you can clearly hear the guide.However you do it, I think your visit to Rome isn't complete without a visit to the Forum."

When I crossed the gate coming from Constantine's Arch I made a turn on the left and passed under a giant roman aqueduct, then I advise you to go see the enormous retaining walls that allowed a building extension to the palatine hill (for imperial palaces mostly), they are indeed impressive you can't miss them! Them I went to the inner gardens of the palatine called Stadio Palatino,a big rectangular and green open space, lovely! it had once a two-story portico all around! there were many houses(domus augustana, domus severiana) all of this in massive proportions, the walls and roofs, amazing! Well they are the Imperial Palaces!! Wen I reached the top, the palaces were less impressive, but wen I got to the other end of the hill, I was prized with a stunning overlooking view of the roman forum!!The palatine hill was something I wasn't expecting, and impressed me a lot!"

We went on our own thinking that we could follow along on the audio guide but it was pretty bad. First off, you cannot actually follow the audio guide's route due to construction near the senate building. Secondly, the descriptions were not very helpful and were long-winded and boring. I do NOT recommend getting the audio guide - go with a real guide! You really need it in order to understand anything about the site, since nothing is labeled and if you don't get an audio guide they don't give you a map.

I highly recommend having a private tour as we were able to hear and see exactly what she was showing us. She had so much knowledge of the Ancient Ruins, my children are actually still recalling the information we learned from her. She intertwined history with the artifacts and a timeline of how and why things happened when they did. We were able to take the information we learned from her to the next tour at The Vatican City. We had a horrible, group tour there. If I had known better, I would have hired Chiara to do that tour as well. Because it was a private tour, we were able to move quickly and see more of what the ruins had to offer. It was definitely the best tour we have ever taken. In hind sight, I would book Chiara through Emma Villas for one tour- a private tour, and then contact her personally (they give you her cell#) to see if she can take you to other places. 5 starts out of 5!!"

We did not get an audioguide, and was the poorer for it, but still got an idea from the information stands and the map. One palace stood out for us, the complex that was built by Septimius Severius, who was Roman Emperor around the year 200. The Flavian Palace overlooks the Circus Maximus, and one can only marvel at the scale of undertakings that was done here. If you finish your visit of the Palatine Hill here, and have about two hours of your afternoon left, it is only a ten minute walk down the Via Terme di Caracalla, to visit the baths of Caracalla. Also begun by Septimius Severus, and finished by his son Caracalla in AD 217, it is a marvellous example of Roman ingenuity and engineering."

Walking down a road where Julius Caesar once walked, seeing the remains of once vast temples and getting a feel for life in ancient Rome is fascinating.Okay so the buildings are really just ruins and some people have described it as stones and rubble but if you become aware of the history then it does come to life. So don't just wander round, you need to be guided. This could be by a tour guide, a book or as I would advise an MP3 recorded tour guide on your phone or MP3 player. We used a tour by Rick Steves. This meant we got a full explanation of what we were seeing and a real feel for the events that happened exactly where we were standing. It also meant we could go at our own pace, as it was a sunny 35 degree day and I am Scottish (I get moon burn :) I like to move from shade to shade and having my own tour allowed me to do this.We loved the whole experience, thinking about Roman legions riding down these roads in victorious return to the city gave me Goosebumps.A visit to Rome would simply not be complete without a tour of the Forum."

We went in August and yes it's very hot but we planned to spend the whole day looking at the 3 sites of Palentine Hill, the Forum and the Colosseum so took our time. Someone recommended we go to Palentine Hill and Forum first as there were no queues as most people head to Colosseum first. We got in very quickly and purchased the audio guide. It was a bit frustrating to follow as not very clear where you are supposed to stand for each location and could do with a numbered sign so we knew we were in the right place. As a consequence we ended up repeating each bit several times and took a lot longer than it should have. I would recommend printing a guided tour from the many you can find on-line to take with you to make more sense of it. Even so it's quite an amazing site and well worth a visit. We spent all morning there and had a long break for food and drink in the shade before heading to the Colosseum mid afternoon and walked straight in ahead of those queuing to purchase tickets. Again the audio guide is a bit disappointing with not enough information. A good guide book to accompany audio guide would be recommended. Also the queue to pick up audio guide is same as the drop off queue and as they keep a credit card or passport to make sure you return handset, there was a long wait to give audio guide back. Not very well organised. But All in all an awe inspiring day!"

The signs aren't in important places (which is good to preserve the view) but do not really teach you about the history of the sites. A lot of museums in other countries include the audio guide with the price of your tour so I think it's slightly annoying that you need to pay extra for it. I have heard of audio guides you can download as mp3s and listen to on your mp3 player while you walk around for free, so that might be an option. Other than that these areas are beautiful and it is a good deal that the various attractions are bundled for one price."

But she just said no maps, only audio guide! I'm so annoyed! I have paid 12 euro for the entrance fee and am not even entitled to a map?!!! I felt that visitors are being forced to rent the audio guide as there are no sign, no map and no proper guide. It cost you 5.50 to rent the audio guide and you need to queue up again after buying the ticket. Again, another long queue. Although the ticket is valid for 2 days but you are only allowed to enter each of the attraction once! You cannot re-enter the same site for the second time within the same day or the next day after you have exited! As such, the 2 days validity period is not very helpful at all."

Get an audioguide but first get a glimpse of it from Google Earth to know where would you be and get a quick idea about the huge and sprawling place. The ticket costs 12 euros per person and it also gets you in the Colosseum. This helps you avoid the long lines waiting to get entrance to the Colosseum, The other good thing is This ticket would stay valid for two day, and that is good as you will very exhausted after the first day in the Palatine Hills and the Forum Romanum. Get yourself a bottle of water, then you can refill from a lot of places inside, try to wear comfortable shoes, sunglasses, sunblock, and a hat."

They do have a bathroom.5) Do not buy bottle water from guys standing besides the staircase toward the top of the hill (near Stadium of Domitian's Palace).

Everyone is miserable and wishing they hadn't spent $50 for walking around a heating pan. I don't know who these people giving it 5* rating are- probably some crazy palaeontology/rock historians types from Hong Kong who don't mind the heat. I like history more than the average person but this was pure torture. Without a real guide, the map and audio-guide are incomprehensible. The map black and white and the size of a post stamp.There are so many things to do in Rome... don't waste precious time. Don't do this to yourself, let alone your kids."

If you're not familiar with this archaeology then get yourself booked onto a tour, that will help a lot. If you go in high summer then make sure you take sun tan lotion and plenty to drink as the sun will suck the energy from you in no time at all. There are toilets available and there are running taps where you can refill your water bottles. The water from these taps is totally safe to drink too.Be prepared for long hot days in the central area."

Its an amazing place. Its hot and there are pies to fill your water bttles from - eep an eye out for the lizards i you into nature and have children who like thi sort of thing. Apparently we found out at a later time there is an option of getting gladiator training dressing up in the full gear and having a fight - would have done that if we'd known.Palatine needs more imagination - we had been to pompeii a couple of days earlier so dont feel its a fair review from my part but probably spent too much time in this area - disappointed in the museum. Forum - very magical get a map if you not havving a guide as its confusing and the history is well worth it could really grasp the ancient city would revisit this in the future in cooler weather for more extensive disccovery.

You can enter this on the same ticket/pass as the colosseum (use Roma Pass to bypass long lines - see my review of colosseum for info). However when I was there the last week in June, finding the entrance to the forum was a huge challenge for not only me but many others, as there are many paths that appear to go to an entrance but instead end up at fences; I finally asked a policeman and got directions. There was no signage and it turned out I had to go back up along the main road and away from the colosseum to the traffic light (to what was previously just an exit) to enter; this is due to the extension of the metro that is being built right there. For information and a walking tour for the site I downloaded Rick Steve's free podcast which gave me a very information walking tour and I didn't feel I needed anything more re info. If there had been good signage/entrance would have given 5 stars but so much walking and back tracking which also caused me to miss Palatine Hill due to time constraints so only 4 stars (but this is a must not miss attraction)."

There was limited written boards to inform what we were looking at so would advise to have a guided tour.  the ground at times were very uneven and it is a big asda that you cover so its advisable that you were comfy footwear, i word flip flops which wasn't my greatest idea!your feet get really dusty too.  the ruins are so interesting and it definitely worth the money because you will be there for hours! and no street sellers inside woohoo!"

Give yourself plenty of time for this site,it's huge, we had a 2 day pass from doing our tour of the colosseum, we only used one day of the pass but in hindsight should have used the other day too. The day we went it was hot so in no time we were really struggling, so my advice is to get there early in the morning. Loved the history. A tour would have been good to understand more about the place but they do have plaques along the way explaining some of the ruins. It really is a must see"

You can see the forum and Palatine Hill at your leisure, and there's plenty of places to stop and rest with strategically placed water fountains to drink from. Both the history and the views from the top of the hill are things you should come here for, but this attraction seems less crowded than the Colosseum can get anyway. I was a little disappointed with the Romulus Huts as I'd climbed up the whole hill only to find the \"huts\" were just holes in the ground filled with rocks, but the feel of the rest of the place connected me much better to ancient Rome. Leave a bit of time to explore this area as you won't want to rush up the hill, especially in the heat, and leave buggies behind- I lost count of the amount of people I saw struggling with buggies on the ancient cobblestones."

You get a great panoramic view ,from the southeast corner of the hill, of the Forum, Arch of Constantine and Colosseum when looking from left to right. There are a few fountains scattered around the area and ruins that offer crystal clear, ice cold water that is necessary on a hot day. There isn't a lot of shaded areas and facilities are scarce so keep that in mind prior to starting up the hill."

Even after a few hours we felt a little rushed to get in to the Colosseum, however, it turned out to be perfect timing, as there were few people left at the Colosseum by the time we got there (after 5pm). Expect to walk, a lot. Palatine Hill is vast, with hills, walkways and lots of stairs, but it is fascinating and is so big, you won't feel crowded like many other Roman sites. Skip the audio tour--we tried it, but nothing is marked, so it's very difficult to figure out where you are on the audio. If they fix the signage issue, it might be worth it. In addition to the expense, the units don't work well, and we had to return one. We saw many people doing the same thing. You also have to wait in a separate line to get one, and you have to leave an ID with the desk, which also means you can't exit from the Forum and go on to the Colosseum without first returning it. Take in your water bottles; there are fountains with potable water you can refill them--and you'll probably need to. There are bathrooms in the white museum about midway. Buying a combo ticket gets you into the Colosseum the same day and you get the benefit of skip the line without the extra expense. It's the most economical way to see both."

If you want to skip an official tour, get a small guidebook or one of the numerous walking tour guides for free on the Web (no tour guides are required).

Definitely head up the Palatine Hill and see the Cardinal's Gardens - there's a lovely view of Rome from high atop the hill.

We ended up wasting an hour staring at piles of bricks that were better looked up in the internet rather than explored on foot. There was a crowd gathered at Stadio Palatino probably because it was recognizable and had a marker with description. Here we found a big Colosseo/Forum/Palatino location map that identified other points of interest as well as drinking fountain, washroom and entrance/exit locations. A copy of this map should have been given free with admission! We followed the signs to Casa di Augusto and were sorely disappointed when we got there. It was behind closed gates with some work underway, there was nothing to see. We went to Museo Palatino just to use the washrooms. The Palatine Hill has a viewing deck but the view is nothing compared to those you can see from the Gianicolo, St Peter\u2019s cupola or Il Vittoriano\u2019s terrazze. There was hardly anything worth taking pics at this site. It has a lot of history but sadly we did not find it interesting. It might help if management (Soprintendenza Archeologica di Roma?) provided free maps and put up markers with descriptions as well as reconstructed drawings at every significant rubble to serve as visual reference. Until then I say visit the Forum but skip Palatine Hill."

This is the most tranquil of the three, situated high on a hill, there are fewer tourists, and some great views of surrounding Rome to be had. Though much of what must have been opulent palaces has been reduced to rubble, it\u2019s still possible to imagine what life must have been like for Roman high society and the Emperors. The site is massive, and some parts of it are still very impressive indeed. I was surprised just how integrated and close it was to the Forum.

After the hoards in the Vatican Museum at at the Papal Audience, we were pleased and soothed to find we had the paths and venues almost to ourselves on several occasions. Finally, it is not a new insight, but it is useful to think about how the palaces of the rich and powerful are all gone. It reminds me--in my humble life--to understand the transitory nature of power and to try to invest in things that last. Highly recommended."

The kiosk girl responded to my request for a free-bee with a massive yawn - not even a hand to the mouth. I have a reasonable knowledge of Italian, but she did not know this, and my explanation that I was English received a barrage of hostile Italian that translated roughly as 'get lost'. Unless you opt to carry your passport (not advisable) or birth certificate everywhere, forget it. We paid Euro 24.The Palatine gardens are these days scruffy and weed infested. We came across one loo, mixed gender, no signs of any shape or form, and a little boys-and-girls room that you would definitely prefer to forget. If the Rome archaeological authorities want to keep attracting visitors they need to improve their act. I know Italy is in recession but it is not sufficient justification to soak tourists at every opportunity, and one or two could do with a refresher course at charm school.If you want nice, relaxing gardens in Rome, the Borghese Gardens that you get to via Flaminio on the Metro are prettier, they won't cost you, and you may not even get yawned at."

If you don't like crowds and are not a huge history buff, go late in the day...around 5:30. There are very few people there, albeit some of the attractions are closed for the day....like the house of Augustus and Livia and the view of the Circus Maximus. If you are a big history buff, also go late in the day, but return the next day since your ticket is good for two days...and see the sites that may have been closed previously. The museum is small but I enjoyed it. If you like history you will enjoy it. If this is the first museum you've seen on your Rome visit you will enjoy it. If you have seen the Vatican museum, Capitoline museums, or National Museum of Rome already, then skip this as it is sculpture and bust overload. The house of Augustus is very cool. However if you're not overly enthusiastic about the Roman empire skip it as there is generally a half hour long line. If you are looking for the throne room, it seems its no longer accessible. Also as of April 2013, the Romulus and Remus huts that guidebooks tell you to visit are also no longer accessible."

I wil recommand spending a good half to a whole day here if you have the time to spare: the tickets include Colosseum for 2 days.

A little history here and there.I felt we just walked around and looked at one ruin after another not really knowing what it was, the history behind it etc.If the ruins were not so impressive and vast this would have been even more disappointing."

            "review": "Breathtaking place - but disappointing information. To see an amazing place that we have been aware of all our lives was fantastic. We started at the entrance by the Palatine Hill and used an audio guide. The numbered map provided to use with the audio guide was totally inadequate and, unlike the excellent audio guide at the colosseum, there were no indicators at the site to help with which number to key on the audio device. Also, because we entered at the Palatine Hill entrance and not the Forum entrance on Via del Fori Imperial -THE NUMBERS ON THE MAP NEED TO BE FOLLOWED IN REVERSE. This is probably sounding like gibberish unless you have been and tried to follow the guide. In a lot of places - most particularly on Palatine Hill, we struggled to relate the map,guide and site together and hoped that everything would fall into place at some point, but it remained difficult and frustrating to follow. It was clearer when we reached the forum area, but still inadequate as some parts that the guide tells you to walk through were closed.This is an incredible historic place that once affected the history of a vast area of the world but we feel as though we have missed out on a lot of information. It could be organised much better - a few scale models of what it was like in it's glory days would have been so helpful and valuable - there is certainly the space there for this without impeding on any of the site. An absolute MUST has got to be maps and audio devices that correspond to the Palatine Hill entrance. We came away with a plan to buy a DVD/Book to go through and tally-up details with what we can remember. NB. The whole area is totally unsuitable for disabled guests due to the rough terrain."

            "review": "Excellent views, an essential companion to the Forum. The Palatine hill was where the Roman elite mainly had their homes and palaces from the earliest history of Rome right through to the later Emperors. Indeed our word for 'palace' derives, I believe, from the word Palatine. It was here that Romulus and Remus was supposed to have lived, and where figures such as Cicero, Mark Anthony, Emperor Augustus, Nero and Domitian had their palaces. Indeed it is worth remembering that what you see today are the ruined remains of perhaps 1,000 years of building activity which transformed the original shape of the hill. The large brick structures which you see from the Forum are merely the supporting structures for the great marble palaces that would once have stood on top.Here are the main things that I have discovered on my visits to the Palatine Hill:1. Do consider getting a Roma pass for 30 euro before going to Rome. You can buy them on the net beforehand and pick them up when you arrive. I picked mine up at the airport at a tourist information desk - it was very quick and easy. The Roma pass gives you free access to your first 2 attractions and then half price to many more, for a period of 3 days. It also allows you free transport on the metro and by bus for 3 days. The Forum and the Palatine Hill count as one attraction when you use the Roma pass. The Roma pass also allows you to skip the ticket queue at attractions which can be a real boon. Note that one place where you cannot use the Roma pass is the Vatican - for that you need a special ticket which can be booked in advance on the Vatican website. Note also that the Vatican museum is one of the few Roman museums to be open on a Monday so it may make sense to visit it then if you can. 2. The metro in Rome is very easy to use as it only has two lines which cross Rome in an X shape with the intersection at Termini main train station. One arm of the X comes from the direction of the Vatican and goes down towards south-east Rome and the other arm comes up from south-west Rome, past the Colosseum and on up to north-east Rome. The Colosseo stop is probably the closest stop to the Palatine Hill. If you have a Roma card you can simply walk up to the ticket barriers, hold your Roma pass up to it and they will open for you. The buses are also easy to use and cover more of Rome than the metro. With a Roma pass you can simply jump on whichever bus you want without needing to buy any additional ticket.3. The Forum is joined to the Palatine Hill so it makes sense to do the two together. It is basically one big space. There are no ticket barriers or anything separating the two.4. The Palatine Hill is grouped close by a number of fascinating things to see which you can visit in conjunction with it. There is the Forum, which is joined to the Palatine Hill, the Colosseum which is very close (maybe 200 metres), Basilica San Clemente (which has a fascinating piece of Roman housing in the basement), Trajans Markets, the Baths of Caracalla and much more. You can certainly quite comfortable do the Colosseum, the Forum and the Palatine Hill in one day and that would be a sensible group of things to see. If you don't have a Roma pass, you can get one ticket which covers the Colosseum, the Forum and the Palatine and it costs 12 euro each.5. Do bear in mind that both the Forum and the Palatine Hill are basically open air, so come prepared for the weather. And I don't think that there is anywhere to get food or drink, so you might want to pack a picnic. Toilet facilities are limited too. There is a museum on the Palatine Hill and there are toilet facilities there. It also takes a good few hours walking on sometimes uneven paths to see both the Palatine and the Forum. I don't think that most of either the Forum or the Palatine Hill is going to be very accessible to those with walking difficulties. If you have such difficulties you will need to look into access to these sites beforehand.6. You can get some great views of Rome from the hill - for example looking down into the Forum and from the other side of the hill, directly down on to the Circus Maximus, the great chariot racing circuit of Rome which is, to this day, the largest sporting venue ever constructed. The hill is also pleasantly covered in trees and it can be a wonderful place to stroll on a sunny day.7. The hill is not well sign-posted at all and is a rather confusing jumble of remains. Do bring a map and do a little reading beforehand to make sure that you see the main sights.8. The main sights on the hill are probably the Houses of Augustus and Livia. Augustus was the first emperor of Rome and Livia was his wife. Their houses are remarkably well-preserved although they tend to be shut somewhat randomly! The Palatine museum is also worth a look, as are the rambling jumble of palace remains which cover the whole site. There is also a tunnel which I believe linked two palaces belonging to Nero which I found quite interesting.9. I have not yet chosen to get either a guide or an audio-guide, preferring simply to wander at my own pace. One type of guide which I have found useful, and which you can buy widely in Rome, is a special type of guidebook which has modern-day photos of key sites together with transparent slides which you can overlay to see what the sites once looked like. This can be very useful. I have certainly seen these for the Forum, but am not sure if they cover the Palatine Hill in detail as well. You will see them advertised as many small newsagents, newspaper stands and small shops."

Because so many areas were closed the map was very confusing and we couldn't find our way around. We obviously understand there's restoration work going on and that;s ok but someone should at least warn tourists where it is.It's nice to see how the Romans used to live but actually compared to the Forum the Palatine Hill is really not that special so I'd recommedn spending a couple of hours in the Roman Forum and just walking through the Palatine Hill .You get a ticket for all three attractions anyway (incl.

The ruins are amazing and you can see and discover so much of ancient Roman life here. We spent two hours here and it felt like not enough time to appreciate it all.A few comments: it doesn't make sense to visit without a proper guide or map or without reading up about it properly. You'll end up walking around, not knowing what's what, it's pointless. They don't give you a map unless you buy the audioguide.We had a big glitch with the audioguide: we bought it for both palatine hill and roman forum (7 Euro instead of 5) at the entrance and found we had to leave an id as deposit which was very impractical as we wanted to leave through the other entrance, closer to the colosseum. Never mind that. They gave us the audioguide and told us to walk to point number 1 which was about a 10 minute walk away from where we were. When we got there one of the audioguides wasn't working but we were close to another entrance so I went to exchange it (they had the same audioguides available) only to be told that they can't exchange it and I should go to the entrance I came through- 10 minute walk away! After arguing with them for a while and saying there is no way we are possibly walking back they agreed to exchange it but they made it very clear to me they were not happy about it. After that we walked around and it was great although the amount of information could be overwhelming at times. Gorgeous place though and could spend hours there but someone needs to talk to staff and make sure they know who the paying visitors are!"

We bought our 2 day tix to Forum/Palatine/Colisseum at the Forum entrance on Via del Fori Imperiale. The weather: January 2013, 40-ish with heavy rain the whole 3 hours that we trekked through mud and puddles. The ticket agents at the entrance were not helpful and didn't even provide a basic map with our admission. There were no guided tours available. Using Rick Steve's and Fodor's guides were impossible in the downpour plus they are not very clear if you don't have a point of reference when you enter. The signage at the Forum is awful. Unless you really know what you are looking at, don't go without a personal guide. We don't know how good the audio guide is because we're not audio guide people. Other visitors wandered about aimlessly like us and we all had the same complaints: Not knowing what we were looking at. Re Palatine Museum - nothing memorable. The best thing about the Palatine Hill was the view of the Circus Maximus. We had the feeling in advance that the Palatine and the Forum were separate but they're not. The Palatine is a section of the Forum, just up a hill."

The site is larger than I anticipated so there wasn't time to see everything. It's also exposed to the elements so dress accordingly. There are many steps and uneven cobblestones which are hazardous on a wet day so a degree of care is necessary. There are toilets at the entrance gates. There's a wonderful panoramic view over the city from the terrace at the top of the hill.There are several entry and exit gates (some are exit only). I used the Roman Forum entrance and there was virtually no waiting time to buy tickets. Combined tickets are available, for 12 euros, for entry to the Forum, Palatine Hill and Colosseum. The Forum and Palatine Hill are part of the same site but you have to exit and re-enter to gain access to the Colosseum which is a completely separate site. There's a combined audio guide to the Forum and Palatine Hill - you have a choice of paying 5 euros if you intend to return it within 2 hours, or 7 euros if you return it within 3 hours. If you exceed the time limit you will have to pay an extra 5 euros for each additional hour when you return it. You have to leave your passport at the entry gate as security. This of course means that you have to return to the same gate to return the guide and retrieve your passport when you're ready to leave. As it's a large site this is somewhat inconvenient. The audio guide doesn't include the Colosseum - I believe you can buy a separate one at the Colosseum entrance if you so wish. Tickets only permit one entry to each site.I'm not convinced of the usefulness of the audio guide. There are plenty of information boards that you can read as you walk around, and having a time limit on the audio guide is very inconvenient. Being prepared by reading a guidebook beforehand is a good idea."

The sense of history up there is overwhelming and intense and yet there is is a peacefulness at the top and a great view over the modern city of Rome. There is also an amazing view over the forum from the Farnese Gardens.It can be very hot and unforgiving in the high summer so best to visit in spring I think. Take a picnic and find somewhere to eat amongst the ruins and enjoy a leisurely day drinking deep from 2700 years of history. Visit the museum and absolutely try to go on a day when the Casa di Livia is open as this is stunning with amazing frescoes.I always start my day with a visit to the Coliseum, then the Palatine, the Forum and then a wander up to the Trevi Fountain in the twilight to round off the day.

Unfortunately, we\u2019d been on another gruelling walking tour that morning, and we were exhausted for our march up the Hill. Our guide was full of heaps of information about the site, including the palaces. But regretably it went in one ear and out the other. However, what did remain was that according to legend, Palatine Hill was the place where the she-wolf first found Romulus and Remus in a cave and raised them as her own. Romulus then went on to kill his brother and found the city of Rome there. If nothing else, it makes for a good story.The line for admission is very reasonable, and as the tickets purchased there also get you into the Colosseum, it\u2019s a great way to skip the queue at the latter. And there\u2019s also the odd stall out the front, where you can buy an overpriced snack or a cold drink.It is worth a visit. But just make sure you\u2019ve got the enthusiasm for it."

If you are going here and want to know the history then i would look into getting a guide, but if you are just wanting to site see then dont get a guide , and make sure you get a guide that you can understand a lot of the guides i heard around us i couldnt understand and they were speaking english."

A good tip I can offer is to buy a book called Rome Past and present, which is sold by street vendors near by. This book will give you images of what the ruins looked like back in the 7th century. A must when you visit Rome."

Possibly would have missed it completely if it wasn't included in our entrance ticket for the Coliseum and Roman Forum. We'd just come from the Coliseum, and, not knowing what to expect, we thought we would give it a few minutes before heading to the main event: the forum.Well; expect the unexpected. This place just blew us away completely. It's a big, sprawling complex of ruins in very good condition that just seems to go on and on. There are surprises around every corner: like the sunken arena set between the two ancient villas. And a sunken garden behind one old residence. I was amazed at just how tall, and deep, these structures were. And I overheard a local guide explaining to his group that the building were twice as high when built than than are now. The early Romans were certainly not scared of heights.We ended up spending almost 3 hours here. We'd decide to just go so far, but then a new sight would draw us in further and further into the ruins. There were plenty of areas that were fenced off and just a jumble of old building stones, making you realize just how vast this place must have been in its prime. The parts that were excavated and accessible, from towering ruins to underground roads, held our interest for hours, and it was only reluctantly that we turned back to allow us sufficient (albeit shorter) time to explore the forum.I would rate this place above both the Coliseum and the old forum, and you don't have the crowds to contend with. Later we visited what's left of Circus Maximus, and from there you get a fantastic view of the Palatine Hill ruins."

If you are a fan of ruins don't miss this but be prepared to walk a lot. The water fountains have wonderful cold water you can refill your bottles with.

Don't even bother try to get a view of the Circus Massimus from here - it's blocked off, and even if you could see it - it's just a grassy, gravel field. MUCH better is the view of the Palatine structures from the Circus Massimus if you are walking in that direction anyway (near Santa Maria in Cosmedin, for example). From the view point on the far side of the Circus Massimus, you can really appreciate just how huge the structures on the Palatine really are, something that is elusive when you are walking among the ruins. When visiting the Palatine, I'd suggest just wandering around, getting the overall picture from the (few) informational signs and your guidbook, but enjoy the atmosphere, the views, and gardens."

One downfall is that the current excavations mean that some parts are closed - but there were still more than enough fascinating sights to see in one visit. A guide or audioguide is an essential - otherwise you're just looking at a pile of stones, but the explanations on audio guide from the ticket office were very good. The downside is that they give you a tiny map to follow, and at times it can be hard to locate the right place to stand (and this is made more difficult because parts of the audiotour route are currently closed as already mentioned). However, with a little patience, and a boyscout badge in map-reading the audiotour provides for a full and rich day of sightseeing in both the forum and paletine. If in doubt try a tourguide - but be warned, last time we visited Rome the guide was in training for The Olympics and rushed us on at too fast a pace. The audioguide enabled us to go at our own pace.Other reviews comment on carrying water - and this is a good idea, but there are a number of places where the Roman Springwater can be used to fill your bottle. Be warned though, once filled with water - there are precious few places to visit where one can become comfortable! We tried to use one of two toilets on The Paletine, which was temporarily closed for cleaning. When we tried to wait, an overzealous cleaner told us firmly to go away and find another toilet!A thoroughly enjoyable day - even in the rain - made better by the excellent commentary of the audioguide. For 7 Euros it was very good value."

The Palatinus is a hill alongside Forum Romanum and Colosseum, the most famous of the historical attractions in Rome, and one can buy a combined ticket to all three. According to our experience of many discussions with people visiting Rome, Palatinus is often omitted of the three. Don't make that mistake, since in the end this is the one that will leave the most impressive and deep-felt image and one where you will want to visit again. It is enough to visit the Colosseum and Forum Romanum once, and you will see them anyway many times during your visit, if you move around that part of Rome. But you can really spend time on the Palatinus Hill, both engaging with the history and finding tranquility in the arboretum. What's more, there are several places where you can get a good view of the city.There's a historical museum that offers interesting insights into the ancient habitation on the hill, but it is a bit old-fashioned so perhaps not so engaging to some. The main historical attractions are the ruins, however, among which my favourites are the racing arena and the banquet hall.Whenever we visit the Palatinus, we bring our own stuffed panini sandwiches with us and dine in the arboretum, one of my favourite places to rest in Rome. Just don't litter!"

We aimed to take in the Palatine Hill and Roman Forum sites as the last stop on our weekend of exploring Rome last week (21st September 2012).Having walked down from our hotel near the Spanish Steps and then spent 2+ hours in the Colosseum, all in 30 C heat, we got to the Palatine Hill entrance to be greeted by another queue. With no shade and the 100 metre queue seemingly not going anywhere quick, we decided to skip it.Instead, we walked around the Perimeter (past the Circo Massimo - which is a bit of a mess), up via san del theodoro (there's a good bar for a quick drink there called 0.75) and then climb up the zigzag of Via del Tre Pile. At the top of this road you can look down into the entire Palatine Hill site and take some good pictures.From here you walk straight into the beautiful square by Il Vittoriano."

I purposefully stayed in accomodation one road away so that I could gaze upon this site daily. The best view is from the Capitoline Hill and I highly recommend going there at dusk or dawn, as the viewing spot is packed during the day and nothing beats standing there at 11pm with no one else there and just gazing out over a remarkable piece of history. Remarkable considering it had become a cow field in the latter par of the last thousand years with most of the lower standing monuments only unearthed in last hundred years or so.  If you are a fan of Roman history you will be in your element here - it is a must go to place. I highly recommend purchasing the 3D souvenir photo book from the tourist bookshop, as it has reconstructed images of what this and other important Roman sites looked like in their hey day and you can switch between the now and then photo/image in astonishment. Sadly the audio guide was extremely confusing and very short narratives about different sections (if you do take this option remember to take ID e.g passport otherwise they won't rent to you). I didn't take a tour but listened in here and there on passing tours and I would say the more personal tour you can take the better, as we could never hear what the guides were saying clearly and the groups were 15+. Purchase your tickets online in advance to avoid the queues you can print tickets from home and bring them with you. I highly recommend this destination."

Don't miss the gardens overlooking the Forum.The one set of toilets that aren't marked on the site plan - and accordingly didn't have a queue - are near the Arch of Titus in the building adjoining the Temple of Venus and Rome.

It is now mostly tumbled down ruins or excavated walls with a couple of fountain ruins. The information signs are absolutely essential to understanding what any particular ruin is. A tour guide adds much useful information. At the far end of the hill is a remnant of the Farnese garden (build in 1550) promoted in the tourist literature. The garden has only a single entry/exit but the views are grand.The Roman Forum is easier to interpret. It is probably a quarter to half mile long with ruins, arches, and temples throughout. It provides a better \"feel\" for what ancient Rome must have been like. These sites would be difficult for individuals requiring walking assistance or wheelchairs"

While it's a bit of a hike to get to the top of the hill, once you're on top, the walks are very easy and the ruins are worth a leisurely stroll. There aren't any concession stands on the property, so bring your own water. There are also few sitting areas, but there are many shady spots where you can relax. Many people were picknicking on these shady grassy areas when I visited. So if you are a non-athletic traveller or simply would like to take it easy, the Palatine Hill can accomodate that after you get to the top.If you don't need a leisurely day and want to take-on the hill without breaks, you should be able to see everything in 1.5 hours. Just be sure to bring a map since the ticket office doesn't hand out any, at least not to me or anyone else that I saw. And the direction signs on the property simply are WRONG! They will point you to the Forum entrance and you will find yourself elsewhere, repeatedly. So, it's easy to get lost; however, if you come without a map, there are plenty of visual landmarks to guide you, chiefly being the stadium.The stadium is a must see. Supposedly St. Sebastian was martyred at the stadium and there's a big bloom of beautiful purple flowers growing in the area, at least in May/June. Also a must-see is Livia's house where you can see a great deal of the villa's layout. At the end of the house, down the hill a little is a FANTASTIC view of Rome with the Temple of Hercules to your left and St. Peter's Dome straight ahead. This is one of the best photo-ops of the city. But the star attraction of the hill, to me, were the tunnels, called the Cryptoporticus. The Cryptoporticus is a series of tunnels that the emperors would use to get around the city without being seen or exposing themselves to the threat of crowds. Despite the safety purpose of the Cryptoporticus, in one of these tunnels, Emperor Caligula was assassinated. I was a little hesitant to walk through these tunnels--fear of the potential creepiness, cave-ins, and claustrophia, but the land around the tunnels has been dug up, so there's a reassuring blast of sunlight at the end of each tunnel. Also the tunnels are amazingly sturdy and preserved; you can even find some great ancient reliefs and carvings inside them. These are definitely worth seeing!If you plan on seeing the Colosseum, Palatine Hill & Forum in one day, I'd advise that you visit in the order listed. After seeing the Colosseum, you'll exit behind the Arch of Constatine. Don't go back to the Via dei Fori Imperiali, which you'd likely take to access the Colosseum. Instead, take the road to the left of the Colosseum exit (Via San Gregorio) and go upwards to the lesser known entrance of the Palatine Hill. There should be either no line there or a very tiny one. When you are finished with the Palatine Hill, you can enter the Forum directly without reentering any lines outside. Go down the ankle-twisting original stone path carfeully! You'll be facing in the direction of the Colosseum on this path and enter the Forum by the Arch of Titus.I booked my online reservations through OmniTicket before my trip: the Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill three-in-one ticket. It cost 13.50 Euro per ticket for all three sites and no wait in line. There's no signs or separate entry area for the three-in-one ticket, so just go to the area designated for the Roma Pass, raise up your printed-out ticket, and the guards will let you in."

The Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are a glorious testimony of the illustrious Roman past, but to truly appreciate the significance of the ruins around you need a bit of imagination and, most importantly, adequate guidance. We are here to warn you that the scandalous Audio Guide sold at the entrance to the site is one to avoid as an overpriced and inadequate service that does not actually reflect what you see on the ground.Crucially, with an audio guide you should be able to clearly understand what you\u2019re looking at. But the Roman Forum audio guide is not grounded on the map, and consequently two reasonably intelligent persons with some experience reading maps got quite lost in the details.The main complaints are these:1. The official site map is outdated, inaccurate and misleading! The site\u2019s layout has clearly changed: some paths are off-limits, some roads are closed, and some ruins are simply not accessible. None of these changes are reflected on the map. Regrettably, the audio guide tracks correspond to this map, and now the audio guide walks you through places that are inaccessible on the ground!2. This would have been OK if there was some way to re-orient yourself when the map and the guide mismatch, but no. There are hardly any signs in the site, and none of them use the numbering system of the map and audio guide.3. The audio guide is nicely divided to tracks (you click a number to play the relevant track depending on where you are) but the commentary is continuous from previous tracks. You can\u2019t always make out the historical context if you just click a track in mid way.4. The audio directions for navigating around the site are also relative, not absolute e.g. \u201clook to your right\u201d or \u201ccontinue the guide when you pass the temple of Castor and Pollux (remember there are no signs on the ground corresponding to the map...) Therefore it\u2019s hopeless to re-orient yourself if the road was closed or if you took the wrong turn.5. The commentary is uneven. Some tracks are very basic for the un-initiated tourist, while others assume a deep background."

It doesn't have the opulence or grandness of St Peters, the richness depth of the Vatican, or the beauty of the Sistine Chapel, or the steps of the er...Spanish Steps.The Roman Forum and Palatine Hill is the beating heart of Imperial Rome. You can walk where not just emperors and Senators roamed, but where the millions of ordinary Romans saw the seat of their empire. The senate. The Temples. The sacred flame. The law courts. The triumphant arches. The palaces...so some of them are just ruins, but that's what you get guidebooks for. That and your imagination to fill in the gaps. For a mere 12 Euros (at time of writing)!So here are my helpful tips:(1) Rome isn't just about the place where the gladiators fought. But if you just want to visit the Colosseum and you have very limited time, just pop to the Forum or Palatine Hill entrances, buy your ticket there and walk back.. Enter via the group entry signs and skip the horrendous queues.(2) Take plenty of water.(3) The Houses of Augustus and Livia have limited opening to preserve the archaeology. Head there first and early to avoid queueing or disappointment.(4) For your own sake go to the loo before hand and use them when you see them. Facilities are few and far between on these sites. They haven't quite mastered catering to the tourist masses just yet, surprisingly.(5) Take water.(6) Dress appropriately. That mean sun block, hats, good shoes (it is uneven underfoot and not fully pavement for the stupid unprepared tourist in high heels)(6) Take plenty of water (and food). There are no cafes etc on site at all. If you leave the site, you cant go back in. Don't say I didn't warn you.(7) Beware the guided tour groups! These numpties plug themselves into their headsets blithely following round some tour guide carrying a coloured flag or brolly and barking into mikes, and they have literally no regard to what's going on around them. Women, children the infirm...watch out for the invading hordes!!! The problem with these groups are they are so interested in the audio track and keeping up with their guide they lose all perspective of what goes on around them and they pile through anything. No wonder pickpockets thrive at tourists sites!(8) Take a guide book. You'll notice in Rome the locals aren't great in labelling anything, so you have to self identify a lot from the books. When they do out a sign up its usually just in the mother language (of the monuments that is).(8) Take plenty of water, head wear and good shoes. If I hadn't mentioned that already.And after all this you can leave one exit and pop into the Colosseum without queueing. What a grand way to end you day."

We booked a tour guide for when we arrived. We had not really done much research on the different tour guides, but the one we had, Felicity, was very good and enthusiastic and she really brought the whole history of the area to life.The guided tour was about 1 hour long and we went through and looked at the various different temples, archs and buildings. Felicity gave a brief history of each of the buildings. You had great views of the City, and you could really imagine the hustle and bustle of the city in Roman times, when this small area would have been the centre of the huge Roman Empire stretching across Europe. With Julius Caesar and Nero striding through the streets.Once the main tour had finisged we were free to wander around some of the other sites and take in the view.The fact that over 2,000 years ago the Roman Emperors and generals had the confidence in the future to build the various temples and that these have mainly survived all the tribulations of history and passage of time is truly inspiring.As with many monuments in Rome, you are walking in the footsteps of history."

This we were okay with...the thing that really angered us was the fact that the audio guide was not beneficial unless you started at the Roman Forum... we had entered at Palatine Hill so were not pleased we had to trek through Palatine Hill to begin properly looking at Roman Forum especially in 30 degree heat, would have been better if the woman on the desk had told us this. Another thing, with the audio guide, you did not know where to look, there was no signpost of interest so we were listening based on guess work....due to the fact we'd been given an old map!!! So although it is a beautiful place...I'd advise going through a tour group or at least enter through Roman Forum...least then you stand a chance of knowing what to look at."

(I also don't like that me and my partner nearly gave ourselves twisted ankles tripping over uneven cobblestones, but these are, probably, the original flat stones, so I can't really complain about that!)The signage. So, I knew where one toilet was - at an entrance - but despite having a map and there being signs, the \"toilets\" labeled on the signs were not where the signs pointed to and I ended up never finding them. I also never did find the \"Romulus Huts\" which I really wanted to see, unless it was next to the House of Augustus - I don't know, the signs pointed here and there but if we did actually see them, we wouldn't have known it because it wasn't labeled. Many places DID have adequate signs and even short descriptions and history. Very good, English translation mistakes aside. (Doesn't matter if you know your Roman history).** Speaking of languages, the signs, etc are bilingual in Italian and mostly-correct-English. If you read neither of these, you will need a guidebook in your language.Tips for travellers:- Bring water and lots of it (or refill in an antique wall-water-spout fountain if you're feeling brave). Even at 70F and partly cloudy you are walking (and even hiking) a lot and you will get thirsty.- Bring a snack or have a big meal before going. There are random places to eat overpriced food OUTSIDE the forum but if you're still viewing the huge grounds and feeling hungry you probably can't leave and come back without paying again. I had a granola bar just in case but didn't need it because I had a good-sized breakfast. - Wear sunscreen - you will be out in the open for hours. I wore SPF30 and still got a little color (I burn easily).- Wear hiking shoes or cross-trainers. You will be traversing uneven flat stones, rough and uneven cobblestones, gravel, and steep slopes and steps."

Instead they recommended we went to the Colosseum to obtain one from there - which would result in joining an even bigger queue to then go all the way back again. I don't think so!

I don't usually go for an audio guide but the place seemed so vast that we felt it would help us get a better grasp of it all. The problem is that it is virtually impossible to work out which number corresponds to which site so we couldn't find the correct commentary, and then we realised that the information on the little maps we'd been given was not the same as the large maps around the site! Then my audio guide stopped working altogether and when I asked for my money back, the girl on the desk was a complete cow about it (I'm used to rudeness in big touristy cities but she was reeeeally bad). This may all sound petty but we quickly became tired and irritated and by the end of it we couldn't have cared less about the stupid ruins, we just wanted to get out of there and find wine and pizza.

It was lucky we had that, as to borrow an audio guide at the gates you required official ID (eg. Passport) which we didn't have. It may also be worthwhile to visit the Pantheon first, to give you an idea of what Roman buildings looked like (as it apparently looks more or less the same as it did back then), before you try and imagine the grandeur of some of the ruined buildings in the Forum.

Archeology would seem to be about defining the different periods, firstly from the layers. The great thing about archeology is nothing is for sure, all the great ones will give you at least three stories for each subject. Also you have to use your your imagination, eliminate certain parts, to imagine what it was like in this or that period, fascinating! It actually made me depressed at one point to realize what tremedous wealth the Flavian Emperors had and how even with all there power, how Rome fell in the end... if you buy your ticket for the Palatine just do the Palatine, take a sandwich up there with you and stay all day."

Pick up the handy map at the entrance and map a path that will let you exit into the roman forum. In the midst of the maddness of the crowds in downtown rome, this area is quiet, isolated and almost unpopulated. My grandson and I enjoyed the solitude and the interesting ruins and gardens. We stopped for our midday picnic lunch. Take your time because there are a lot of nooks and crannies to explore. They have excavated the ruins of some of the old houses and restored some of the ancient gardens. Be sure and visit the overlook just beyond the gardens. It is a great view of the forum below. A great picture site and you can see every building below. When you are ready to re-enter the crowds, follow the path to the entrance to the roman forum. Walk down the steps and you are in the forum near the entrance across from the coloseum where the crowds enter, so you won't miss anything. Remember that the palatine hill is include in the combo ticket for the coloseum and the forum."

I did not understand that my card was taken by the cashier and thought that it was either lost or stolen when I was coming away from the cashier's window with the tikets. I got stressed very much and have to call the bank (international call!) to emergently block the card. Maybe, the cashier warned me, but it was impossible to hear her perfectly, because of the plastic glass wall. By the way, the other cashier at nearby window used the loud-speaker. Was my window not equipped with it? Furthermore, after I had found the card absent I asked the officer to check at the cashiers if I had left my card there forgetting to take it after the paying. The officer kindly did it replying that \"no, there was no card left at the cashiers\". Couldn't he guess I was asking right about the card taken as the deposit?! Such situation would be impossible in my native country, Russia, because a credit card is considered to be personalized finansial document, and it cannot be asked or withheld as a deposit by anyone at anycase (because a misusage by other person is possible). Is it OK with it in Italy? So, I regreted very much that I took the audio-guide, further more the sound quality was very bad, it creaked steadily while speaking"

I would therefore recommend taking a good guide book with you, or doing some serious reading beforehand, just to ensure that you get the sense of occasion of the site.There is so much to cover in this area, that you could easily spend a couple of hours here, if not more. Plus if the weather is not too hot, it is a lovely spot to sit and watch Rome from the top of the hill and you get some great views.Some areas worth mentioning are Domitian's Palace built in AD 81, Augustus' house built in AD 1, the Temple of Cybele the Farnese Gardens (great views over Rome from here) and there are numerous others.I would highly recommend this as a historic spot, without the tourists.

The Pantheon might have offered light on the gods 1900 years ago but today the Pantheon is a Roman Catholic Church. Though it does not resemble a church because of it's architectural design, it is indeed a church as signified by the large crucifix. Therefore, there are no images of \"gods\" in the Pantheon. A stunning piece of architecture!"

As I am an EU teacher I got in for the reduced rate of 7.50 euros (EU children are free) so spent 5 euros on the audio guide, with an extra 2 euros to include the Palatine Hill (the birth place of Rome) that you should include as it takes longer to explore than the ruins themselves..There is little information inside so I think having some kind of guide, be it audio or written is worth it. This audio guide is one where you hold it up to your ear rather than having headphones. I did therefore have some tricky moments holding it, along with my umbrella (essential sun shade) and the map. There are no audio guide numbers anywhere within the sie so you have to identify your location on the map and then type in the number. This does present some difficulties such as when the narrator says \"look at the column on your left\" and you, not having a particular point of reference, can see columns in all directions. It is hot so bring water bottles - there are several fountains within the site from which you can refill bottles or cool yourself down. It can also be very dusty. I had the the audio guide for 3 hours and had to leave to return it as my time was up - it was a rush to get around in this time and I could have stayed longer."

Roma Pass was useful for skipping the ques, and we avoided the touts (guide, ear phones - but with 40 others!!) and opted for audio guide (which was fantastic in Pompeii) - very disappointed. Unlike Pompeii there were no highlighted spots on site, only on map to know where to stop and listen. this made it very hard to know what they were talking about - or referring to, even when you thought you were in the right place. Map was poor too especially when some ruins were blocked of and you had to work out how to get to the next number on the other side of the blocked off one. I really recommend a guide with a small personal group if you can manage it - i really feel i would have got more out of the trip that i initially looked forward too. Go late in day to Colosseum for less crowds... E12 for the lot - good value."

But there is no need to pay someone to tell you what you can read for free online and bring with you (or just get a guidebook like we did). If you don't want to carry the heavy pages with you, then just copy the ones of the palatine hill and bring those.While we enjoyed the roman forum better (we had the free rick steves tour on his iPhone app for that) and enjoyed the history there more... the palatine was still worth it and had some amazing views over rome and the forum!

It was nice to walk around for about an hour in the forum before the first groups started to arrive (we call them herds of cattle) and then we headed up to Palatine and the museum and again, no crowds. We spent a little over an hour in the forum listening to Rick Steves podcast which is free on I-tunes. I suggest having some sort of a book/audio guide otherwise you won't know what you're looking at. Palatine Hill is really very beautiful and the views of the forum and the coliseum are incredible. We also liked the museum which was nearly deserted. We spent about two hours walking through Palatine hill and we could probably have spent two more.So don't forget... buy your ticket on-line and go to the forum first.

The hill was where many of Romes rich and powerful had their palaces over the centuries and it is fascinating to walk through the remains of their homes.Like the Forum it is not an easy place to visit at all if you have walking difficulties - it's a long walk, quite steep in places and uneven.I do not recall there being much in the way of facilities, signage or explanatory material on the Palatine Hill so make sure that you have some water with you, a guide book and a coat if the weather looks suspect.

Much work is being carried out on preserving what's there and unearthing more ruins so it's a little like a construction site too. The crowds gets bigger as the day goes on, so again, get there early if you want to move around more freely. We didn't have a tour guide, but were able to eavesdrop in many places to pick up on what we were looking at. We could easily have overlooked Caesar's resting place if it weren't for being next to a guided tour. While we spent an hour at the Colosseum, we spent several hours wandering the Forum and Palatine Hill. Tip: wear good walking shoes and be careful if it's raining as the pathways get slippery.

Also, the House of Livia and the House of Augustus are highlights of the visit but they are not open every day and they are not necessarily both open on the same day.

The wealth of really significant important sights here is stagering. You can see the curia (the Senate), the Temple of Jupiter, the Rostrum, the triumphal arches of Titus and Septimumius Severus, the location of the cremation of Julius Ceasar, the Basilica of Constantine, the Basilica of Aemilia (where you can see the remnants of the sacking of Rome by the Goths - look for the green stains in the rock, they are the melted coins), and so much more. You will walk on the Via Sacra and touch the stones touched by the ancients. The richness of history here is palpable. Take your time and enjoy it. Remember though, you have to go over a few blocks to the Largo Argentina to see where Julius Ceasar was assassinated (a place that is shockingly unexploited and relatively inaccessible).

Spectacle from lost ages on all sides, whist treading upon the ancient roadways constructed by the slaves of the Roman Empire. Starting at the Colosseum, winding up hill on the ancient stones of Via Sacra, (the road depicted in movies with the Roman Legions marching down it and the crowds standing on the sides of the road cheering), passing Caligula's Palace, the Basilica of Emperor Constantine, and through the archway of the Roman Senate. Smack in the heart of Rome, surrounded by the modern ways of a modern city with the Roman Coliseum to the South, lies the ruins and the history of the former greatness of Rome. Easy to get to off of Metro line A, (Colosseo stop), or by taking bus number 60 to the Coliseum, Via Sacra wanders up the hill through the columns and arches of the Empire. The cost is relatively inexpensive for the experience, 11 euros, (around 17 USD), for entry into the Coliseum and Palatine Hill. Private guides are also available for an additional charge. Palatine Hill encompasses the funeral spot of Julius Caesar, the Roman Senate House, temples, forums, and everything you've ever seen in a gladiator movie. On your left after your entry from the south are the remains of Caligula's Palace, (Emperor from A.D. 37 to 41, and the guy who gave all Emperors a bad name), and immediately on your right is the Basilica of Emperor Constantine. The Circus Maximus lies just to the west, (home of the chariot race, a.k.a. demolition derby with horses), and the Pantheon is about a mile or so north. At the end of the Via Sacra is the legendary Roman Forum. Guide book vendors adorn the entry and surround the Coliseum, and the purchase of one, or the acquirement of a guide I highly suggest. Knowing what you're looking at makes the experience of Palatine Hill come alive, and the experience should not be shortchanged. It's the birthplace of the Roman Empire, and a must see destination on any trip to Rome. Magnificent doesn't describe this incredible Roman day trip. It's an easy 5 stars."

My sisters and I, unfortunately did not have this foresight so we did not get to fully appreciate the significance of the forum remains. We were walking aimlessly in the forum and Palatine Hill, and the mid-day May heat did not help either :("

It is unbelievable how the emperors lived!!! The indoor riding stadium, the banqueting rooms (where you lie down to eat), even the wall decorations which looked very modern. The view of the forum and Diocletian baths is stunning. The original aqueduct that supplied homes on the hill is still intact. Some of the ruins are so sparse that you will have to have a guide to put it in perspective. This attraction is underrated."

But folks please please do not crawl or climb up on the ruins that have been around since 500 B.C. It was a little embarrassing to see American tourists being so disrespectful for the sake of the a picture and the security guards will escort you out."

We walk up Via San Gregorio and get online for the Palatine/Roman Forum entrance. We wait about 45 minutes and buy our ticket for the combined entrance to Palatine/Roman Forum and the Colosseum.We enter and start walking around toward Casa di Augustus (Augustus House) and stop at interesting ruins and vistas along the way. As it turns out, only 5 people at a time are allowed into Augustus, so we skip it. We walk more and see that the Palatine overlooks the Roman Forums. We walk through the Palatine and come through the entrance to the Roman Forum. It was a lovely day, but make sure to wear sneakers (or closed footware) or you will get dust all over you.Listen in on a tour group, if you can and receive a mini-history lesson. There is not too much to see here as the Roman Forum and Colosseum are right in front of you and included in your ticket."

            "review": "Fascinating for history buffs. We started our Ancient Rome touring day at the Palatine, where we bought our combined Palatine/Forum/Colosseum ticket for 11 \u20ac. This was a trick from Rick Steves that worked great, since there was no line at all at the Palatine, and we wanted to see it anyway. We didn't get a map with our ticket, so if self-touring like we did, I suggest taking copies of maps and/or tour itineraries. The best guide I found for the Palatine was in the \u201cBlue Guide Rome\u201d. The Palatine was fascinating. There is a lot left of the giant Imperial palaces, so you can easily imagine how the emperors lived. Domitian's private stadium is largely intact. There are also older ruins on the site, going all the way back to Etruscan times, and the views from Palatine hill are superb. Well worth a visit, especially for those interested in Roman history."

The Palatine usually plays second fiddle to the Forum and the Capitoline, and wasn't marked as a 'must see' in our guide.In many ways though it was actually better than the Forum. Not as historically significant I'm sure - but there's actually quite a bit left of the various emperors' palaces.You get a good idea how lavish the lifesyle of the rulers must have lived - and the hill itself is like a little oasis of greenery and calm in the midst of the bustle of Rome."

We enjoyed the Hill as it had loads of ancient ruins lying around for us to look through and under and around. As usual, bring your own guidebook 'cause there's nothing there to tell you what's what. There are: a grotto, a garden, great views of the surrounds (the Forum, the Colosseum, and Circus Maximus) and the city (you can see St. Peter's Basilica in the distance). There are marble bits lying around, so you can take a rest on a marble column if you're tired. There's a small museum with more interesting bits on show (statues, wall paintings) and it's a great place to cool off from the hot sun. (It's also got a lavatory.) Behind that is the Circus Maximus which is now mostly a grassy area bounded by parked cars. We liked Palatine Hill, mostly because there's lots of open spaces for kids to run around in, lots of trees, and because of terrific views of Rome around you. In reality, there's actually more to see at Palatine Hill than the Colosseum -- don't miss it!"

            "review": "Great guide for Ancient Rome. We scheduled a private walking tour of Ancient Rome with Through Eternity tours for September of 2006. We booked this tour with them online at . Our guide was Andrew, a young , fun and knowledgeable fellow from Ireland. He met us at our hotel in the morning and we took a cab together over to Palatine Hill. We got our tickets at the Palatine Hill entrance, which is key because the line is so much shorter there than at the Colosseum. Andrew then quickly immersed us into the Ancient Roman world with an accurate and entertaining history lesson that continued throughout the entire tour. Our tour included the Palatine Hill, the Colosseum and the Forum. At first I thought that we could tour the ruins on our own, but about a week before the trip we decided that we wanted a guide to help us make the best use of our time. I am so glad that we decided to hire a private tour guide. As we traveled I saw large groups struggling to keep together and listening to their leader with headsets. It was nice to be able to chat with Andrew and ask him questions at any time. He allowed us to linger where we wanted to and I am sure he was able to tailor our tour to us based on our reactions and interests. I would definitely recommend Through Eternity Tours-and ask for Andrew!"

These are the remains of the royal families' residences--and you can see why 'Palentine' is the origin of the word 'Palace'. The place must have been immense: vast rooms on multiple levels. Check out the 'rec room' and the room with the fountain in particular. Use your imagination along with a guide or a guidebook (we used Rick Steves) as there are no markers to tell you what you are looking at.The museum (the only 'modern' building) has some very nifty stuff ie models of the original huts on the hill, and an amazing piece of mosaic from the palace is mounted on a wall. As others have said, there's a bathroom here, so take advantage!"

Also, if you need to use the toilets, use them here, practically no wait unlike at the Colisseum."

I'm usuually no tour person, but here you NEED a guide, otherwiuse it is better not to visit this place at all. Invest your money on a good guifde. Two nice options (we tried sweveral ones, as we visited Ropme 9 times) are: Icontours (for good grouptours, ask for Naomi or Mike) or still better, but obviously a little more expensive: Roberto Miglio, a great private guide, -----------------------, ask for his handsome looking son!!! :-)"

The entrance fee includes entry to the Coloseum and is good for 24 hours, so be sure to hold on to your ticket. This is a pretty big area with the ruins of ancient palaces so you might want to read up on it and study a map before going. Pay a short visit to the small museum - there are some great statues and mosaics - all the interpretive material is in Italian. Nero's Palace is here - it's mostly underground and has a separate entry fee."
