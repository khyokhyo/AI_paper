            "review": "Manaslu + Annapurna (20 days) - fantastic guide!. Our trek included the entire Manaslu circuit to Dharapani, where we joined the Annapurna circuit and completed it in Jomsom. Our guide Harry Pokhrel from\u00a0Great Vision Treks and Expeditions was\u00a0top class. His English was excellent, his care for our welfare during a sometimes gruelling experience was\u00a0second-to-none and he was great company too! Our porter (soon to be guide) Krishna Khanal was\u00a0strong (machine-like stength) and had great humour, rounding out a stellar team!\u00a0The Manaslu circuit is a highly cultural and challenging experience. The mountain when you see it, is easily the most spectacular we saw in the entire trek. Though we originally planned to trek the Tsum valley, the state of the trail leading to it was unsafe. One complaint of ours is that Great Vision failed to inform us of this until we were basically starting the Tsum valley! To be fair to them, they had a plan B and we changed our itinerary on the spot to include the Annapurna circuit. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, insofar as the Annapurna trek was awesome. Ask your trekking company about the state of your chosen trek, be aware they don't like to disappoint you so perhaps reassure them that any news is good news where safety is concerned.Shankar, the manager of Great Vision, kindly picked us up from\u00a0the airport, welcomed us warmly to Nepal and was generally very friendly. Our only complaints about his service was occasional lack of clear information. I would recommend potential customers to challenge him on everything to do with transport to and from the trek and transport of your bags if you are ending up in Pokhara afterwards.Harry our guide is local to the Manaslu region, actively seeks local knowledge regarding state of the trails and landslide prone areas. He ensures food is hygienically prepared and trust him on his choice of accommodation. Generally his choice is best and he is alert to Western comforts. He is also great buzz and taught us many things about the local flora and fauna (including eating foraged food) as well as many evenings playing Nepali card games together. He is a kind-hearted and honest man who we instantly warmed to. He even invited us to dinner with his lovely wife Sangita when we returned to Kathmandu (she is an amazing cook!).Our porter (again, soon to be guide) Krishna was also awesome company and such a funny dude. Same as Harry, he is local to the Manaslu area and is actually Harry's cousin!Overall, our experience, aided by Great Vision, was mind-blowing. If we had to choose one trek over the other, our choice would be Manaslu. It is more challenging (no wifi and basic accommodation) but also much more rewarding than the Annapurna circuit. The Annapurna circuit was well marked and provisioned and the views are simply glorious. It is obviously to the customer's taste which\u00a0trek they decide to do. But we cannot recommend Harry or Krishna enough.Cost for two people, a guide and porter,\u00a0all necessary permits and accommodation paid for (we paid for food and considered it a saving over paying upfront) was 1650 USD. We considered this a fair price. However I would mention that if we were to do it again, we would also pay for accommodation ourselves, despite having to carry more cash.Some essentials :Take chlorine solution for water. No need to buy any just fill up from local taps in the mountains. Your guide will help you choose faucets or tals that are safest. We also had a lifestraw and a steripen.Bring snacks with you if you can. Buying on the trail is costly.\u00a0Be careful on the Manaslu trek there are some areas which can turn dangerous in a hurry. Ask your guide questions about the state of the trail and how safe sections are as you encounter them.\u00a0In Lho, a small village in the Nubri valley, visit the small monastery in the town. The monks and especially their Tibetan cooks are so welcoming and looked after us with a fire and plentiful tea. Lovely experience.At Sama, if the weather is clear enough, attempt Manaslu base camp on your rest day. It is gruelling but at the top the feeling is incredible. You also gain some valuable acclimatisation and sleep well that night!"

            "review": "Great care, kindness and honesty for Upper Mustang trek with guide. This is the second time my partner has booked with Great Vision and my first. Shankar met us at the airport and helped us plan an awesome trek in the Upper Mustang region. We were assigned Ragesh (we called him Razz) who really took care of us on the trek. Our plane from Pokhara to Jomson was cancelled and Shankar organised a jeep for us all the way from Kathmandu so we wouldn't miss out on our trekking days. When we changed our plans for the end of our trek (choosing to spend some time in Chitwan instead of heading back to Pokhara) Shankar ensured that we had a ride to Chitwan and organised a driver to get us back to Kathmandu. While we were walking Shankar also organised our India visas and bus trips for the next part of our journey out of Nepal!Overall, Great Vision are an warm and friendly company. Almost everyone who works in the company is family to Shankar, and GV really go out of their way to help you. From booking stuff to telling you the fair price to pay for souvenirs and services. Our guide had a backpack full of medical supplies and additional clothing in case it got cold and ended up helping other trekkers along the way who had less prepared guides. I would 100% recommend Great Vision trekking to anyone (and will send my friends their details) and will definitely be booking with them when I'm back in Nepal."

They expertly organised a guide and all other arrangements for our 12 day trek on the Annapurna Circuit and we could not be happier. Our guide Ganesh was very experienced, a lot of fun to trek with, and was very knowledgable about all things to do with our trek, and Nepal more generally. We also arranged to have our bags sent from Kathmandu to meet us at the end of the trek in Pokhara, which at the time we were slightly nervous about, but which came off without a hitch.  Great Vision also were very reasonably priced and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to organise trekking and other activities in Nepal. "

We walked the Annapurna from Bhule Bhule to Jomsom. Easily the most incredible walk I have done. Our guide Ganesh was an absolute legend. From helping us get on the right bus to picking the right tea houses, he ensured that our trip went down without any issues. Shankar was also a great help. He organised to have our bags moved from Kathmandu to Pokhara and sorted all of our transportation. All in all, we had a great trip and could not fault Great Vision. Plus, we've made two great friends in Shankar and Ganesh!"

It was an adventure from the get go, without having to deal with any of the stress usually involved in planning a trip like this. It was my first time trekking further than to the local bar, and I've been craving more ever since getting back to Denmark.I do have to give a huge thank you to Harry, our guide, for putting up with us and just for being the way he is. Great sense of humour, almost inexhaustible, and the apples he packed and provided for dessert was a definite icing on the cake. If you're ever in doubt whether you even need a guide, Harry is worth it just for the company. On a final note, the scarves we were given for good luck actually worked. We were upgraded to business class on the flight leaving Kathmandu, and I refuse to believe Great Vision didn't have a hand in it. Either way, they deserve all the credit for an amazing trip!Wishing the whole gang in Nepal the best,Mark Jennings"

He organized the Annapurna circuit and Chitwan very well for us. Our guide Santosh and porter Soo Zan did both a very good job. Radjive was the guide of another hiker but helped us very good as well, especially when we had problems with the altitude. The atmosphere within the group was very nice, spent lots of time playing games and the guys learned us a typical Nepalese card game (dumbal). We can definitely recommend this family company."

But after having a meeting with the guys, I got a very positive sense of the company and after relaying the meeting, my companion and I decided to book. We had Harry as our guide for the trip and I must say, we've are immensely glad that we did! I had a couple of days in Kathmandu before setting of, and got excellent help for taking day trips, planning the trek and finding a better hotel than the one I was booked at for the first days. And once we were on the trek with Harry being our guide, the experience got even better. Harry is definitely a guide I would recommend. He is easy talking to, fun to be around and really knows his way around. There was never a time when we - or others around - did not feel taken care of or left with unanswered questions.I could probably write pages and more pages from the trip and my experience hiring Great Vision Trek, but I'd rather recommend you take the trip yourself. And if you do, these guys are without a doubt those who will get you there! Only regret I have is not travelling longer!Regards Christian Kj\u00e6r, Denmark."

I arrived in Kathmandu with no prior arrangements and expected to burn a couple of precious days in making arrangements to acquire a guide and to fly to Lukla to begin a trek to Everest Base Camp. Instead, the travel desk at the airport took my information about the type of accommodations and travel interests and then pointed me to a smiling young man... Shankar. He quickly came over to the desk, listened to the info and assured me that he could make the arrangements and have me booked to Lukla quickly with a guide and mountain accommodations. He was very friendly. He and his driver ferried me and another airline passenger for no charge to the hotel wherein his office was prominently located. (Note: This worked well in Nepal but, when in South America, never get in a vehicle that is not marked as a taxi). Shankar handled every detail from that first day until I got in the plane for the flight back home. He did so for a very reasonable fee. Shankar, the tour operator and a former guide, described the itinerary and possible flight delays due to the start of the \"rainy season.\" I flew out the next morning and was met at Lukla by a wonderful young Sherpa, Gyelgan. He spoke good English in several dialects. Gyeljan took good care of me. He quickly ascertained my conditioning level and monitored my health status regularly and adjusted our hiking speed and itinerary as reasonable and necessary. Overnights and dayly meals in the various \"tea houses\" made travel easy. I had a great time interacting with local people. Gyelgan seems to know everyone. There is no need for a tent or a sleeping bag. The rain did delay our flight back to Kathmandu but Gyelgan and Shankar modified flight tickets and coordinated with pilots as necessary to get me a flight. No worries for me. Overall, it was a great trip with wonderful friendly people. Oh! The views and scenery are spectacular - as expected.JesseRetired firefighter USA"

Normally I get very annoyed at these sort of things, but I honestly liked him instantly. He offered us an excellent deal on the Annapurna Circuit trek and we left after one day. Our guide, Ganesh Khanal, was SOOOO knowledgeable of the region. He was super fun to talk too, his english was outstanding, and he was an amazing hiker. (He NEVER got tired!). He could answer all our questions about each region we hiked through and he always walked at our pace. Our two porters, SooZan and Subash were so great at their jobs. They were always smiling and laughing, and they were very encouraging of us as well. If you plan to go to Nepal to do any hiking, I highly recommend requesting Ganesh as your guide, and go with Great Vision. There are many many trekking organizations in Kathmandu, but seriously- go with these guys."

Going to them is like going back to \"my family\". Prices are right and service is alway excellent. If you plan going to Nepal look for them.A good advice. If you are going hiking be sure to have an inssurance that covers emergency transportation by helicopter. My FINNISH insurance was a BIG disappointment but Great VISION adviced me on a great insurance!THANK YOU GREAT VISION"

I was so lucky to meet Shankar at the airport when I arrived in Nepal because he helped me with my whole itinerary while I was there for 2 weeks. He planned for me a trip to Chitwan and a trek, including all of the transportation to/from Kathmandu. He was really informative, explaining what each part of my trip entailed, and he brokedown the prices for me as well. I actually had a wound on my leg that was healing slowly, and he was very flexible with me, letting me know that if my leg didn't heal after my Chitwan trip that I could get my money refunded for the Annapurna trek (and told me how much that would be). That was such a relief. I found him to be very friendly and engaging, and I think that all the people for the company appreciate working there because of the atmosphere - something that is rare to find sometimes. I LOVED everything about the Chitwan trip that they put together, including the hotel and the guide that I had while there. I ended up being able to do the trek, and I think I got the best trekking guide in Nepal, Harry:) He actually works for Great Vision and does different treks for them. I felt like I was hiking with a friend from home. Except Harry would bring me masala tea every time I was cold:)!! He was very sensitive to my needs and actually ended up changing what we did on the last day of the trek on the fly b/c my shoes weren't handling the snow/ice on the trail we were to take. SO awesome. The places we stayed at during the trek were so much fun. I really had a blast in Nepal. I'm so happy that I was able to get help from Shankar and Harry at Great Vision b/c they made my vacation there so much fun. When I return to Nepal to do another trek, I'll definitely want to go with Harry as my guide and Shankar coordinating:)"

After I met a fellow trekker with the same goal, he got an offer from great vision, which was not only half the price of what other guides would ask for, but also included a 3 day stay at our guides family through the dashain festival. We were absolutely blown away by the beauty and kindness if the people in the little village about an hour away from the start of the trek. We received our blessings from the father and made our way up the manaslu. Of course the scenery was absolutely amazing, but our guide prakash was a blast to have around. He was fun and motivating and he knew what he was doing. From drinking rice wine and playing dumbal in the evening to sliding down snow covered ridges after larke pass it was great to have him around. I stayed for a further month in Nepal after my trek and met up with the great vision team almost daily to go to dance bars, grab some dinner or breakfast, get some trekking or tourist advice or to just do some chit chatting and grab a cuppa tea.Keep up the good work fellas!SANGLA BORO!!!"

From mid october to end october we did the Manaslu Circuit with Great Vision Trek & Expedition. They providied us with a very good package price exactly to our wishes. (all costs of Guide, Transport, permits and accomodation included, costs for food excluded) Moreover the trip schedule was very flexible. The Guide, Prakash Simkhada, Great Vision provided was very experienced and did the trek several times. Also we became really good friends on the trek and had an amazing time. Another group of Great Vision who started at the same time with an other Guide got some troubles due to the bad weather (it was snowing for two days) and altitude sickness in Samdo. Great Vision managed their fly out with the Helicopter as well as they managed everything with the insurance to pay. Our group could safely pass Larke pass and from Dharapani we took a Jeep. I guess managing all the transport at this time (for weeks there was a big shortage of petrol and gas due to the blocked border to India) was not very easy, but it worked out perfectly. I can absolutely recommend Great Vision Treks and Expeditions they were able to provide a perfect, safe and amazing Manaslu Trek under not easy circumstances. Moreover we became really good friends to the lovely family runned company. Next Time in Nepal I will go Trekking with them again."

After two days, Kedar decided he would personally take us to the countryside to make us feel like true Nepali. Unfortunately, there was a landslide on the road we were attempting to take, but he provided us with several alternative activities we could do. We ended up choosing to see more of Kathmandu and once again it was wonderful. Kedar could not have been kinder or friendlier to us and we have never been happier with a decision for a guiding agency. Kedar took a very hands on approach with us and always made sure we saw what we wanted and that we were enjoying our time in his wonderful country, even when he was not the one leading us around the city. Without a guide Kathmandu would likely be one of the most difficult cities to navigate around, but thankfully we had wonderful service and guides and our family cannot wait to return to Nepal!"

The only reason we were successful was because of our guide, Rajeswor Amgain, our porter, Krishna Pandey, and the great organization provided by Kedar Khanal of Great Vision Treks. Kehar was himself a guide for many years and so provided us with a realistic plan and a great team.Although this spring the pass was very snowy, which made conditions potentially difficult, Rajesh stayed optimistic and proved to be an extremely amiable and resourceful guide. I would not hesitate to recommend this company should you wish to explore Nepal. In fact, we are using them again to organize a second trek in the Pokhara area!"

My eldest son is quite the history buff and he was evidently mesmerized with every cultural destination we visited. I think he fell in love with all the temples. My daughter meanwhile enjoyed Chitwan National Park. She kept gushing about the rhinos, and crocodiles she saw even after we went home. I think the best reward for us parents during that trip was the relaxing experience at Pokhara where we went boating and enjoyed the sight of the Himalayas. I loved how relaxing that went.

In short Mosiac were excellent during all stages of our trek from initial emails, delivering what they promised and their staff and accommodation.As close to faultless as you could get.I arranged an EBC and Gokyo trek for 6 friends to be followed by a Chitwan and Pokhara tour by two couples following the trek.Madhav was by far the best of all the companies I approached initially. He replied promptly to all emails and also answered all questions fully as they arose.Our group arrived all at different times and all were met on time. Hotel Moonlight was great accommodation which drew comment from two of our group who have been to Nepal many times and they both claimed it was better than any others they had previously used in other treks.We had major issues with weather conditions for our trek but both Madhav and our guide Bhabanath Adhikari AKA BN always met with us all, laid out our options, and allowed us to formulate any changes if necessary. Luckily although two days delayed we managed to complete all parts of our trek due to the flexibility of the Mosiac team. The guides and porters were great fun, honest and made our trip fantastic. The tea houses were all above my expectations and again them and the meals were great quality.The post trek dinner was a great night and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and Madhav's company on the night.Following the Trek as it transpired only three of us went on the following trip to Chitwan & Pokhara again Mosiac's flexibility on the cancellation of one of the guests was commendable and more than fair on refunds etc. (Keshar) the guide supplied for Kathmandu tours and Pokhara was excellent and all vechicles, drivers and hotels were really good, made us feel safe and comfortable. More delays with weather flying back from Pokhara but Madhav kept in contact from Kathmandu so we at all times were aware of the changing conditions of the airport and flights. To sum up I am a first time Nepal trekker but could not have wanted for a smoother organised trekking company. Madhav had everything covered. This message was again also relayed from the two in our group who normally have trekked using a bigger international tour company in their several other treks, they were doubtful at first but came away so impressed with what the small local company had provided. Really pleased we were able to deal direct to a local company cutting out the big multinational tour group"

He responded promptly to any email or query that I had.Pralhad, our guide, was an exceptionally attentive guide who made the trek a fantastic experience. He was very knowledgeable and went out of his way to help and support us on a daily basis.Our Sherpas, Tiki and Jeeven, were always happy and friendly, their energy was tireless.I was pleasantly surprised with the accommodation and facilities we had during our trip. They were better than I expected by far, even the toilets!!!The food was always hot, plentiful and delicious.With only thee days left of our trek I was flown out by helicopter, from Macchermo, as I suffered from HAPE. Pralhad was efficient when he organised the airvac. I couldn't have had a more compassionate person to be there with me. My disappointment at not completing my trek was at times overwhelming but Pralhad was understanding and supportive in all ways.Madhav was at the hospital when I arrived and dealt with all the details of insurance as well as a daily follow-up on my condition while I was hospitalised.The hotel, Hotel Moonlight in Thamel, in Kathmandu went out of their way to make me comfortable when I was discharged from hospital.I have absolutely NOTHING negative to say about Mosaic, it's employees or the service they provide and I would certainly use the company again in the future.TIPS: Take more money than you think you will need, there are delicious bakeries en route and as you climb higher all items (water, phone charging, drinks) are all more expensive.Consider a small solar charge pack for your phone.Take time to talk to people and slow down, the people of Nepal are a gentle race and the scenery is beautiful."

We called Madhav right away and he was able to arrange a jeep for us for the next morning (and we were really glad that we weren't on that bus!). Our guide Rishi was thoughtful, professional, and a lot of fun. He has a good sense of humor and taught us a Nepali card game at night. He even taught me a magic trick! He went above and beyond what we expected from a guide throughout the trip. We couldn't be more happy with him.

I visited Kathmandu in September 2016 with the intention of travelling to Lhasa; however, after my application for a permit was rejected I was stuck in Nepal with no plans. Staying in Thamel, I googled for reputable tour companies on my phone and came across Mosaic, which happened to be nearby my hotel. I turned up at the office to see how much a trekking tour may cost and what might be possible to arrange last minute. I received a full briefing on the possibilities for last minute 6 or 7 day trek in the Everest Region or Anapurna, as well as advice on gear, plan B if flights didn't take off on the day of departure, and very reasonable and fair prices. I felt very comfortable and paid by visa that day for a trip departing two days later - 6 days trekking to Tengboche in the Everest Region. Mosaic was very professional - enquiring about my travel insurance and also arranging a meeting with my guide (Pralhad) before the departure day. Although I only planned the trip two days in advance of departure, everything went incredibly smoothly and without a hitch. My guide (Pralhad) picked me up at my hotel and we flew out to Lukla. From then on, everything went perfectly - Pralhad knew everything about the trail and I was more than satisfied with all of the teahouses that we stayed at. He arranged everything, including the porter, meals, etc. and I feel like we stayed at the best places on the trip - I had my own room each time, most times with my own bathroom and even hot water sometimes. Pralhad came across as a very experienced guide - and I could tell he was paying attention to the effects of altitude, hyrdration, and also hygiene in the sense that he offered useful advice of not eating meat (because it is not fresh in the mountains) etc. I thought this was a good sign - particularly for tours going further because my opinion was I could trust him should anything ever happen in terms of injury or sickness (so if I return to trek t basecamp I will definitely look him up). Also important to note - as a solo woman traveller in my twenties I originally thought that a woman guide would be the best option (but none were available), however, I felt completely at ease with Pralhad due to his easygoing nature and professionalism.At the end of the trip, our flight back to Lukla was delayed due to technical difficulties and we risked being stuck in Lukla for another couple of days. Pralhad transferred us onto another airline at no extra cost to me despite the extra cost to the company and we got back to Kathmandu on schedule. In comparison, the other trekkers on the flight with different companies who did the same were charged extra by those companies. Given that I practically found Mosaic Travel on the street, I was completely impressed with how smoothly everything went - and some of the other trekkers asked me for the name of the company and guide while we were on the trek based on things such as how the flight delay was sorted out and Pralhad's knowledge of the area and professionalism while we were trekking. I'm tempted to return to Nepal next year to trek all the way to base camp this time and I'd definitely use Mosaic again. I visited the offices of a couple other tour companies in Thamel randomly and although everyone was very nice and the prices were good - and I felt like the tours would be arranged - I felt most confident at Mosaic's office based on their professional vibe and luckily, I was right."

My girlfriend and I did the Gorepani-Poon Hill trekking (5days) with Mosaic Adventure this summer (2016) and it was one of the best experiences we've had in all our travels!We found Mosaic via tripadvisor and decided to look them up in Kathmandu. The office is a bit hard to find in Thamel, but later we were told that they don't mind picking you up at the hotel if you prefer so. We were warmly welcomed and spent a good hour discussing our plans with Raj (founder). He gave us very useful and very honest advice, making sure we would get the best possible experience during our trekking. Next morning we were introduced to Rishi and Purna, our guide and porter. It was really nice meeting them before the trekking. These two guys turned out to be the best guide and porter in the world! Rishi really made sure our trekking was as comfortable and interesting as possible, and Purna is a super friendly father of 2 kids who was always fun to be with on the trail. We enjoyed a lot our evenings with the guys, playing cards and having good talks.The trekking itself was amazing. The 1st day was very easy (just 3 hours walk), and the night was spend in a nice Teahouse on a beautiful location. The 2nd day was very intense (7 hours walk) with 3 hours of climbing 2.000 stairs. But it was a victory at the end of the day when reaching Gorepani. Day 3 was also tough, going up Poon Hill and down to Tarepani. Day 4 and 5 where easy again, but beautiful nonetheless. All together a very beautiful trekking, quite intens but manageable if you are fairly fit.After the trekking we were invited by Raj back to the office to review the trekking. Her truly wanted to make our experience the best possible. We also had dinner with Rishi and Purna, who have become true friends and we will stay in touch with these great guys!I can recommend everybody to book their trekking with Mosaic Adventures. It is a very well organized, honest, friendly and affordable agency managed by some great people :)Thanks for everything Raj, Rishi, Purna!!"

This August a group of friends and I decided to finally do it. We did a lot of research online before deciding to use Mosaic Adventure. The affordable price and the positive feedback from other travelers really was the deciding factor. Mosaic organized our trip down to the smallest detail, and we will cherish the memories of this adventure for the rest of our lives. I could not have asked for more, and Mosaic is exactly the tour company that we were looking for."

Raj responded to me right away with the itinerary that I was looking for and within our budget! Our tour included Kathmandu, Pokhara, Chitwan and a trek to Poonhill. Throughout the whole trip everything went smoothly with help of owner Raj, guide Rudra and porter Purna. Rudra spoke good English and taught us some Nepali along with Nepalese religion, culture etc. We will definitely book with Mosaic again for our next adventure to Nepal!"

We would like to thank our guide Bhabanath for accompanying us on our trip of a lifetime and this firsthand experience of Nepal. He made sure we enjoyed our trip, and even made some changes to our itinerary for us. We had heard that most of the teahouses were pretty similar to one another, but the ones Bhabanath chose for us seemed much better than we had expected them to be. We absolutely fell in love with the villages, and we were constantly amazed by the beautiful scenery. Mosaic Adventure organized an amazing and wonderful trip for us in Khumbu, and I cannot thank them enough!"

He sent an itinerary and quote for a trek to Annapurna Base Camp. I looked at the details of the trip on their website and liked the 15 day schedule they listed. We were able to book online with just a deposit and to pay the balance when we arrived in Kathmandu. They arranged everything, including pickup and drop off, Kathmandu/Pokhara tour, hotels, teahouses, our guide and porter \u2013 they really covered all the bases. Our two week went smoothly, without a hitch. My sincere thanks to everyone at Mosaic, especially Madhav and our patient & helpful guide BN!"

We booked the standard 16 day, all inclusive tour that Mosaic advertises on their website. When we booked, the price was $1345 each \u2013 and it was worth every dollar. There were problems outside Mosaic's control, when our flight was two hours delayed and then we were further delayed at immigration and baggage claim, and we were a little worried that they would have given up on us. We never should have doubted them. Our guide, Pralhad, was waiting with a big Mosaic sign. From the initial trek briefing right through to dinner at Bhojan Griha, everything was well planned. Mosaic Adventure really took care of us, and I would do it again in a heartbeat."

When we approached Mosaic adventure, we asked them to assign Keshar as the tour guide. Madhav of Mosaic adventure made our trip itinerary which was absolutely right paced to cover multiple important sites within our time schedule, which was very short. Keshar accompanied us to Kathmandu, Dhulikhel, Pokhara and Nagarkot. The tour with Keshar as our guide remains a pleasant memory and we were greatly benefitted from his experience and knowledge about the sites. We record our appreciation for both Madhav and Keshar of Mosaic Adventure and look forward to approach them again when we plan our next trip to Nepal for one of their Everest Base Camp tours."

I simply cannot say enough good things about this Nepali owned and operated tour company.I recently completed their \"Taste of Nepal\" tour which included a guided tour around Kathmandu, the famed Poon Hill Trek, and a visit to Chitwan National Park. I also added a flight to view Mt. Everest and the surrounding Himalayas.I had extensive e-mail communication with Madhav, one of the owners, in the preparation phase for this trip. Even before I had agreed to anything, he was very responsive to my questions via e-mail, discussing various trek options and the status of facilities following the 2015 earthquakes.. He must never sleep because many of his replies came at what must have been middle of the night in Kathmandu. The cost of such an inclusive tour was very low, and the down payment at the time of booking was minimal (the balance of pay,ENT was not made until I arrived in Kathmandu). He continued to provide helpful information and prompt replies to my questions during my preparations. He was present on my arrival in Kathmandu, and made sure I was clear about the upcoming details.One of the main logistical challenges of this trip (that involved multiple locations) was that of transportation. Here, the arrangements made by Mosaic went as smoothly as possible. Road conditions are very rough compared to US and European standards, and traffic is nothing short of chaos; however, my travel to and from the airport, around Kathmandu, and between cities went very smoothly. Again, the details were clearly communicated.I had 3 excellent guides for the various portions of my trip. Keshar gave me a great tour around Kathmandu, providing information about the various sites we visited, as well as background about the history- old and recent- of Nepal. Sundeep, my guide in Chitwan, was a great resource about the flora and fauna of the jungle, and made sure I saw as much of it as possible. A special word of commendation must go out to my guide and porter on the trek. Panu, my porter, was a beast as he carried 75% of my gear plus his own up and down the steep and rocky trails, seemingly without effort. He spoke limited English, but seemed to understand mine well enough. He was always eager and willing to help. Rishi, my guide, was nothing short of outstanding. I began the trek at less than full strength, yet he was patient and helpful as I acclimatized to the heat and exertion. Fortunately I grew stronger each day. He handled all the details at the tea houses. We laughed, joked and told stories as we became great friends. He always kept me informed with any necessary details about the trek.I met Raj at the end of the trek. He was extremely gracious, and sincerely wanted to know if there had been any problems on the trip that needed to be addressed (There were none).It is without hesitation that I recommend Mosaic Adventures. The people are committed to providing excellent service, and certainly did so for me. One can take chances with any of the myriad tour operators in Kathmandu, or even attempt to handle the details by oneself, but I cannot imagine the trip could go as well (or much less expensive for that matter) as mine did. I am extremely grateful to everyone at Mosaic. I look forward to returning to Nepal, and trekking with Rishi to Annapurna Base Camp."

Contrary to what is published on the Internet, there are still plenty of places in Nepal that were not affected by the earthquake that hit the country in 2015.

Madhav was incredible at answering our questions and was very quick to respond. He provided us with excellent information on what we would need and what to expect. To be honest, we didn't have high expectations, as we were booking a trek - not a 5-star luxurious vacation. BUT, we were overly impressed and amazed by our trek. It was far more than we ever hoped or expected. Pralhad was our Guide and he was perfect! He made sure we were always hydrated and fed, had what we needed, and that we were enjoying ourselves. He answered our cultural questions and always greeted us with a smile. We can't wait to come back and go trekking with Parlhad again! Thanks for making this an unforgettable trip!!! Amanda & Richard"

Hi all,In August last year, we went with Mosaic tours in Kathmandu to do the Mount Everest Base Camp Trek and some day tours. We would highly recommend them to anyone who is keen on doing a tour in Nepal. They are reputable, reliable, well priced, trustworthy and most importantly they put our personal safety above all else. All ran smoothly from start to finish. We started our experience with Mosaic Tours the day we arrived in Kathmandu with our guide Pralhad and tour organizer, Madhav. They met us at our hotel in Kathmandu and gave us an in depth run down on everything we needed to know for our upcoming tours. They lent us down jackets and Sleeping bags (free of charge) which saved us lugging them half way around the world. The morning of the trek, Pralhad meet us again at the hotel and we were off on the most amazing adventure ever! If you can get Pralhad as your guide, we would highly recommend him. He really knows his stuff! He is extremely experienced, kind, understanding (especially appreciated by my wife who was a novice trekker), knowledgeable, good fun\u2026 and good at cards! Between Prahlad and our fantastic porter Jetha, we had an awesome experience. When we arrived back at Lukla it was too foggy for planes to fly in, so we ended up having to get a helicopter at our own expense. We were escorted by Pralhad to the spot where we were collected (about 1.5 hour trek) where he dropped us and then trekked back up the mountain to Lukla, which we appreciated SO much. One week after leaving Nepal we noticed our credit card had been charged an EXTRA $1000 USD for the helicopter trip, which we had organized using another company outside of Mosaic. Although the helicopter was arranged completely externally from Mosaic tours, we contacted Madhav and asked if he could help us retrieve our lost funds. Within 2 days Madhav had resolved the issue with the helicopter company for us and had our money refunded!If you are looking to trek in Nepal- Mosaic are awesome, they are the real deal. They are a reliable, safe and a \u2018no-stress\u2019 trekking company in Kathmandu, Nepal!! Cheers Madhav, Pralhad and Jetha! Joe and Soph."

In addition to being extremely competent and flexible, Madhav is a kind and caring person with great love for the people in his country. In the midst of the need for housing reconstruction after the earthquake and a fuel crises causing shortages of materials for daily life as well as for the repair work, Madhav remains upbeat and optimistic. We participated in a five day rebuilding trip in a village 7 hours from Katmandu ( the last 50 km took 4 hours, so you can imagine the roads!), which gave us insight into life in a village. We worked and laughed alongside the Dalit, or \"untouchables\" as we shoveled dirt, broke stones into gravel, and the stronger of us carried heavy rocks from a quarry. Madhav did all this alongside us tourists, and it was a joy to watch his interaction with the villagers, who clearly admired and appreciated him. We also painted the three rooms of the grade 1- 3 school, and then spent a day at that school as well as at the 1 - 12 school when supplies for rebuilding were delayed by the fuel embargo. At the school, we taught about hygiene and taught some songs and expressions in English. The children were delightful and responsive. Asseem cooked delicious meals for us in the village. After the wonderful, heartwarming time in the village, we parted from Madhav and went to Pokhara. Our guide for our \"easy\" three night trek, Pralhud, was extremely helpful, competent, and flexible. When he realized that we didn't have the strength for the original plan, he quickly revised our itinerary and we had a great time. Many thanks to Pralhud and our porter and guide in training, Santos, for their assistance down all those steps from Ghandruk!Not only did we do the rebuilding, trek, and city tour...but Madhav also arranged a day long visit to a school in Kathmandu ( I'm a retired teacher), and a meeting with a public health official for my husband. He drove us to the school and meeting, and we learned more about health and education in Nepal. It was a fascinating day. All details of our trip were expertly planned, and we strongly recommend Mosaic Adventure for great adventure in Nepal. I chose the company online because of the great reviews, and was pleased by all the prompt, thorough email exchanges with Madhav.

One of our friends suggested us to make sure to contact Mosaic to have everything go smoothly. And, we did just that. We were eight of us and every one of us had our trip of a lifetime. Annapurna Base Camp trek was, by far, the best trekking experience I've had in my life. As a matter of fact, it was more the arrangements that Mosaic had managed than it was the trekking which made it special. What we liked so much about them is that they are so easy to access and very organized. Thank you!"

A few minutes on Trip Advisor suggested that Mosaic Adventure was the one to use, 106 recommendations, 106 Excellents! Never seen a 100% record before. Went to the office, hard to find, but a call to Madhav and he collected me from the street. Within 30 mins he'd fixed a 4 day package. Perfect. Polite, efficient and charming. Absolutely worth the high rating.On the Saturday I flew out to Pokhara, 3 hours later the earthquake struck. The following morning I was due to fly back to Kathmandu, but the airport was closed. Madhav tracked me down in Pokhara and organised a vehicle to take me back.Brilliant service and customer care in extraordinary circumstances.Will definitely use Mosaic on my next visit.Thanks Madhav. I hope you and Nepal come through this tragedy soon."

If like us you are booking from Europe then going directly with a local operator rather than through an international company may feel risky. We would very strongly recommend Mosaic: Madhav responded to all enquiries within 24 hours, the information was comprehensive, we were met from our flights, trekking permits etc were organised in advance. Why pay an intermediary when you can go directly so easily?Our trek to ABC was superb. The views were beautiful throughout, and Annapurna Sanctuary was genuinely breathtaking. We took literally hundreds of photos, but they can't capture the massive scale of the Himalayas. A special thank you to our guide Rishi and porter Krishna. Rishi made sure that everything worked smoothly and was able to tell us about life in the mountains, and entertain us with his card tricks and flute. Krishna carried our bags each day: he was a real gentleman and very strong indeed.I hope we'll be back in Nepal soon, and will definitely arrange our next visit with Mosaic."

We were recommended Mosaic by my dad, who organised a similar trip with them the year before, and we will definitely be sharing that recommendation with other friends and family. Everything ran so smoothly (including when flights were unfortunately delayed) and the Mosaic representatives that assisted us were all very helpful and friendly. In particular, we loved our trek to ABC, and this was in no small part due to our absolutely fantastic team of Roshan and Puna. Roshan was an excellent guide; his enthusiasm, knowledge and support, as well as his exceptionable English, made our trek a hugely enjoyable experience. Puna was also very friendly and helpful (as well as incredibly strong carrying our bags up the mountains!) and we believe he will make an excellent guide once he has finished his training. Indeed, the other trekkers we met along the route also told us how impressed they were with our team. We have made some great friends!In all, we had the best trip and are extremely grateful to have had Madhav and the team at Mosiac look after us so well. Thanks again!"

I booked with Madhav in Kathmandu and went for the the Everest Base Camp trek via Gokyo Ri and the Cho La pass. Our guide from Mosaic Adventure was Shanker, with Mingma and Rama as our porters. The company was great about all aspects of the hike. We got in to Lukla on a day where most flights missed out. The accommodation was good and the itinerary coming via the Cho La pass made for a far more interesting trek than the standard Everest Base Camp route, and also a fair bit more challenging.I would highly recommend trekking in the Everest or Annapurna region with Mosaic Adventure, as they were a great team to hike with. Two members from our crew decided not to go over the Cho La pass and Mosaic were happy to split the group and managed the trip so both groups had an enjoyable time. The guides and porters were happy to point things out, go at our pace, laugh and joke around with us and each other. If anyone was not feeling well it was looked after immediately and professionally.The Everest region itself was beyond spectacular with highlights including Gokyo Ri, the Guzemba glacier crossing, Cho Las pass, and Kala Pattar. I would absolutely trek with Madhav, Shanker and Mosaic Adventures in the future, and recommend them to anyone looking for a great company to trek with. Thanks guys!"

I made it clear to Sushil when we met that I what I was most interested in was the \"real\" Nepal, and Sushil delivered beyond all expectations. Here are some highlights of my Nepal trip that was entirely due to Sushil's efforts to make my trip one to remember:* His introduction to goat curry and buffalo momo, washed down with Everest beer, while overlooking the Boudhanath stupa.* Hindu palm reading in the backroom of Sushil's uncle's Nepali homeopathic drug store.* Speaking to his friend of the family, the Kumari's caretaker to catch a glimpse of the living godess.* While trekking, arranging an impromptu meeting with an Untouchable family and seeing their home.* Having a cold beer and spicy Nepali snacks, with a view of the Himalayas while trekking through Nargakot.* Arranging for a three person motorcycle ride up rough and winding mountain roads for an amazing adventure.With any other guide, I would have had a great time. With Sushil, however, I had the Nepal adventure of a lifetime and made a wonderful friend."

I wanted to upgrade a few of the lodging options, which Madhav handled with no problem, and our guide, Rudra, who has been guiding for over 15 years, was fantastic. We had a lot of fun joking around and it was interesting to learn about his family and the various traditions of the Nepali people.

Our trekking guide, Pralhad was really good, always making sure we were okay, he was really patient encouraging us to walk slowly, answering all our question and he also take good care of us both when we got little bit sick towards the end of the trip! The accommodation on the trek was basic of course but the place we stayed always seemed pretty nice compared to some of the other places around. Mosaic were very accommodating, for example we had to put the trek date back just a few days before it started and they arranged this immeediatelly with no complaints, answered all our queation throughout and were extremly organised and efficient (every time someone was supposed to collect us from somewhere they were on time with their Mossic sign, friendly and helpful) also they arranged to donate our unwanted treking clothes to a local orphange for us.

He was always pleasant to deal with, organised and knowledgeable about every aspect and answered every question we had on our way. The weather in October was perfect and we did not even have 1 rainy day! The teahouses were cleaner than we thought and always had great Dahl Bhat and tea after a long day trekking. We were impressed to have Rudra all to ourselves too so were able to stop to take photos or have a rest whenever we wished. The sherpa was great too, always with a smile on his face even after carrying our big bag all day! I saw many people doing treks without guides and even sherpas but I did not regret it at all, as our mind was at ease the whole time and we felt safe the whole way.

I never worried once about trip details. And while on the trek, the guide and porter were both friendly and enjoyable to be around, as well as professional. Although it was the monsoon season, my guide did everything he could to show me the beautiful mountain views! It was an amazing experience. Couldn't have done it without the Mosaic team to keep me composed though, thanks guys!"

There is no easy way to tell how much I appreciate those guys putting all that together for us. I really enjoyed the cross cultural society of Nepal. Shopping on the streets of Kathmandu, traversing the back country and up close and personal encounter with the wildlife was something that is going to go all the way to grave with me. I have never seen such friendly people willing to do anything to make our stay a grand one. We were captivated by the people, beauty of the place and diversity there.I have told everyone at work and our friends about Mosaic. We will certainly get back to them when we are travelling that part of the world."

And I particularly appreciated the \"on phone\" help provided when I needed to organise the return flight.

If/when I return back to Nepal for more trekking, I will surely contact Mosaic Adventure again and happily use their services again!"

They were also extremely helpful when we had several extra days following our trek up to EBC and arranged a splended trip out to Pokhara.

Special thanks to Arjun, top guide, and Radon, top porter, who were both excellent company during the trek and thoroughly recommended. The fact that Raj managed to get me out of Lukla in time for my flight, while others struggled speaks volumes. Also enjoyed the tour of Kathmandu with the very informative Kaysar.

My wife and I went there with our three kids and they adjusted our trip plans so much so that both we and our children felt at home and did not have any hassle at all. The extra care they took to make sure of our children\u2019s safety got us to believe that Nepalese people take their guests for god in every sense of the word.

I had a great time organising my itinerary over the email with Madhav and he was always very efficient at replying and was extremely helpful with my requests and questions. Once I arrived, I found there were some misunderstandings but they soon took care of it, and gave me a refund when they realised I overpaid. They went out of their way to make my trip a memorable and enjoyable one. Madhav even personally took me on his motorcycle to a tailor to get a suit done in Kathmandu! I would definitely recommend Mosaic to anyone who is planning to visit Nepal."

After reading of several reports we decided to buy fly tickets and to book the hotel for two days in Kathmandu. Trough the book service i booked Great Wall. My choice was accidantal. I just wanted to secure our staying in Kathmandu for the short time and in case we wouldn't like the hotel we were ready to change it. The first pleasant surprise was when i received the e-mail from Madhav offering the pick up service from the airport. Later i understood how important was it. The hotel locates in Tamel - district in Kathmandu, actually it's old part, close to Freek Street and to many of historical objects. There are no exact addresses and we had the problems with taxi drivers in finding the right way to the hotel. Anyway Madhav send the car to the airport and we were successfully driven to the hotel. As we understood the hotel is under management of Mosaic Adventure. This circumstance was very helpful for us. So Mosaic arranged our trekking to Everest inside of an hour: all permissions, fly tickets to Lukla, guide, porters, equipment, accommodation, transfers and so on. Unfortunately we had bad luck and on the day when we had to fly Lukla was closed due to bad wetter. We were short of time and decided to rearrange our rout and instead of Everest to go to Annapurna. Many thanks to Madhav - he re-booked and rearranged everything very fast and next day we landed in Pockara and started our trekking to Pon Hill. Now after the trekking I'm sure it was the right decision and only the highest professionalism of Mosaic and especially of Madhav helped us to spend the great time in Nepal. Every country is introduced by the people and such guys like those who are working with Mosaic adventures make Nepal very attractive for visiting and traveling. Herewith i would like to express my personal gratitude to Madhav and very friendly stuff from the hotel Great Wall. They did everything to make our staying in Nepal comfortable, interesting and unforgettable."

My friends and I wanted a highly rated guide service and also one who was responsive and answered our questions. Doing a huge trip of a lifetime like this and trusting someone you have not met in person or have a friend / relative to vouch for requires a certain level of \"testing\" the owners by asking whatever questions concern you and will allow you to make a choice based on a level of perceived trust. Babu was completely responsive, patient, and provided the best possible \"pre trip\" experience we could have even asked for. Once we arrived in Nepal, we met with both Babu and our guide Sonam. They both helped make sure we were ready to go and had all of our questions answered for the path ahead. Moving to the \"during the trip\" experience, Sonam made sure every day that we understood what the plan was, how much water we should drink, what we should eat along the way (including what we should NOT eat or drink!), and worked with us given the different pace of those in our group."

They provide me and my friends with their very experienced trekking guide (KC Bhim) and porter services to ensure I have nothing to worry about, except to enjoy the journey into the majestic mountains of the himalaya. Thank You for the unforgettable experience and for providing me with the best on-route support, Unique Path! I will be back for more. ;)"

When we finally made the commitment and started planning one of the major decisions was whether to trek on our own or with a guide. We chose a guide and porter as we also chose a long (15 day) trek. Unique Path had very good to excellent reviews in our research and they lived up to those reviews. We built in extra days in our planned itinerary and that was a very good thing as well. I suffered from gastro problems 2 days into the trek which slowed us and hiking at high altitude has it's challenges as well. We used our extra days to slow our ascent to stay within the recommended altitude gain recommendations. Something we would caution other trekkers to do as altitude sickness is no fun and climbing to fast can void your travel insurance should you need help.Fantastic experience in a country of wonderful people and spectacular mountains. Unique Path adapted our trip plan to meet our needs and wishes, they were very flexible and accommodating. We could not have completed the long trek without our guides help and our amazing porter to shoulder a significant amount of gear. It allowed us to trek with lighter loads and enjoy the experience more.So do your homework, come prepared and do not hesitate to contact Unique Path for help. They are a great choice for planning and carrying out any trek in Nepal. Highly recommended!!Cheers,David & Karen"

My girlfriend and I were fortunate enough to take this trip of a lifetime a while back and could not speak highly enough of every aspect this trip. From the moment we landed in Kathmandu, transfers were arranged and we were effortlessly guided to Thamel. Our guides Ramon & Raj, alongside our sherpa Yup made all things possible with ease. The professionalism, experience, and hospitality of this team makes choosing this company for your Nepalese trek quite easy in my opinion and would certainly use Unique Path again. We chose the Gokyo Ri trek during the month of May which was fantastic. Less popular than Everest Base Camp but comparable views and we oftentimes found ourselves surrounded by snow capped mountains with no one else around. It was heaven! Highly highly recommended. Thank you so much unique path! We hope to return soon enough for the next one!"

It's clear that Sonam had a real inside knowledge on exactly where to go and what conditions to expect. We felt safe and in good hands the entire time. Sonam went above and beyond his duty by taking us around Kathmandu when we returned. We even had the chance to visit the owner Babu during the festival of Desain that year. Such kindness and generosity... I count them both as my friends to this day and I look forward to going back to trek with them whenever possible!"

The team of Unique Paths is so delightful, experienced and nice. They get my highest appraisals. They hire locals only. And get them insurance and treat them super fair. Which you will rarely find in the Himalayas where thousands of tourists travel with agencies that don't insure the sherpas or guides, let them schlepp way too much weight and make them stay in worse housing than their guests! Not with UP. They are fair all the way. The hotel they put us in was the best in Kathmandu. Please be aware of Nepal standards but for Nepal standards this was the best. They were always on time. The guide was very knowledgable and fun and gave is our space. Even had medical ideas around altitude sickness. The sherpa that schlepped our luggage was adorable and we tipped him a a lot. He was providing for his family with this. Please book UP. They are the Fair Trade of Nepal!"

I will never forget the time I had and the beautiful sites and places I visited. I highly recommend Rajan and Earthbound Expeditions. Thank you for everything."

Their man in Kathmandu, Rajan, was extremely helpful. nothing was too much trouble, from the airport transfer to the farewell dinner....and help with buying a few extra pieces of trekking gear....very cheap to buy there rather than fill up your flight luggage.And their hotel of choice, Thamel Eco Resort, was a good place to start....very convenient location. But best of all was my guide Ramjee who was so considerate with all of my needs, including my slower pace.(I'm 66) He made sure everything was looked after, and got me back in one piece without any dramas. The Annapurna Base Camp trek is one of the best treks to see 8 mountain peaks from one location without any special equipment or experience. I was so moved to get to the base camp at dawn and be overwhelmed by the majesty of those peaks ranged 360 degrees around me.I'm more than happy to recommend Ramjee and Earthbound Expeditions."

I could write a novel on how both the experience and the excellent service we received from the Earthbound team. The key message I would pass onto anyone considering heading to Nepal is that despite last year's earthquakes, Nepal is certainly still a fun and safe place to travel. One of our party had to return home due a family emergency and the Earthbound team pulled out all the stops to get them home as fast as possible. I'd highly recommended them to anyone looking to see this amazing country."

The trek is by no means easy, if one is expecting it to be so, we are mistaken.

I was a solo traveller who tagged onto a group of 11 other trekkers. The Thamel Eco Resort was fabulous. A cute little boutique hotel only a street back from the main road yet so peaceful and quiet. Very clean and well presented. All the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough to help with my stay.I used Earthbound Expeditions from a recommendation from a friend and I wasn't disappointed! Right from the get go everyone was so welcoming and I felt I was looked after really well. Especial being a single girl on my first visit to Nepal. Rajan, Arjun and Bibek (our tour leader and guides, respectively) were amazing! So patient with all of us, as at one point or another we all had aches, pains, sickness and suffered from the effects of the altitude, and not once did any of them make me feel like a was slowing the group down. They really looked after us all and cared about my well being, offering me certain foods to help with nausea and Diamox to help with the altitude, which they supplied. All done with a constant smile on their faces! Such a lovely team.As for the trek it's self.... Incredible! Beautiful scenery, stunning views and those peaks! Wow! I couldn't have asked for a more magical trip, caring staff and friendly group. Despite it being overcast and drizzly for most of the trip (just the time of year) we were treated to glimpses of Everest and were surrounded by towering peaks. The most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. Accommodation is clean and dry, very warm in the main lounge and simple, 2 single bed rooms with shared washing facilities. The accommodation gets a little more basic the higher you climb but that's to be expected. Especially when you see that everything is walked up from Lukla! Toilet rolls and bottles of water included! Simply amazing, herculean effort by all the Sherpa people! A truly wonderful trek! Thank you Earthbound Expeditions for an amazing adventure, new friends and memories to last a lifetime! Jessica"

The ground team is knowledgeable and the trek team are just awesome, from the trip leader, to the local guides to the porters and right through to the food, being vegetarian can sometimes be difficult on travels, but this is certainly not the case with Earthbound Expeditions.It's a pretty basic trip but is fully packed with amazing delights and sights, it's hard work at times but is definitely worth it.Nepal is safe to travel to and this trip is definitely a fantastic one...go on, give it a go!Jasmin."

We changed the offered tour and got our own \u201aprivate\u2018 tour for 8 days. We went together with our guide Namaraj Sapkota and our porter. Because we spent some more time in Nepal apart from trekking, we started the tour in Pokhara. On the tour we slept in comfortable Teahouses and also the drinks and food were quite good.The impressions and views will always be rembered. Our guide, Namaraj Sapkota, told us a lot about the people oft the Anapurna area and Nepal in general.As well as the rituals of the temple in Muktinath, the whole story about the earthquake and even the traditional way of living in this area. Our guide was always careing about us and our health. All the time were feeling pretty save.We didn\u2019t see any effets oft he earthquake in the Anapurna region, all the roads and the bridges were in good conditions, so we had no problems. In Kathmandu we only saw a few buildings and temple which were beeing rebuild.The whole trip was very well organized by Earthbound Expeditions and individual and sponaeous wishes were always possible. We can highly recommed Earthbound Expeditions and our Guide Namaraj Sapkota. The next trip will definitely be with them.All in all we can say the country and the people are amazing, it has an exhilarating landscape."

I did not have to worry about a single detail as everything was planned to perfection. When I needed changes to be made, they were made quickly and I was kept in the loop constantly. I was anxious about going to Nepal a year after the Earthquake, but as soon as I touched down I knew I had nothing to be fearful of. I have never traveled to a country that has made me feel so welcome right from the get-go, and despite all the damage that has been done, the natural beauty of the country and the smiles of the Nepali people shine through. Tourism is essential to helping the country get back on its feet and it felt wonderful to be a part of that whilst being able to enjoy such a vibrant atmosphere.The Everest Base Camp trek was the most incredible thing I have ever done. There wasn't a single day that disappointed and despite it being very challenging, it was 100% worth all the sweat and tears. I have never seen anywhere like it on Earth and I feel so privileged to have been able to see such beauty in my lifetime. Badri, Arjun, Narayan and Baburam were provided the most amazing support system and we couldn't have done the trek without them. Earthbound Expeditions provided some of the best customer service I have ever seen and I will most definitely be booking with them again. The best service and the best experience, provided at the best price point in the market. Thank you Earthbound!!"

Some words that come to mind to describe him are trustworthy, organized, professional, personable and dependable. Initially, our tour was scheduled for the end of May 2015, but due to the earthquake it needed to be postponed until 2016 due to my schedule. Rajan communicated with me immediately after the earthquake and maintained communication throughout the year. I had been a bit unsure about organizing a tour from the USA with a company that I only knew about through TripAdvisor. However, Rajan's professional service reassured me throughout the entire process. This was my second trip to Kathmandu and it was completely safe after the earthquake. Our trip to Tibet was wonderful. We flew both ways to and from Lhasa since the overland route between Tibet and Nepal were still not open after the earthquake. On our return to Kathamandu, Rajan escorted us to a fabulous meal with traditional Nepali music and dance on our last night there. I highly recommend Earthbound Expeditions and also encourage others to consider traveling in Nepal post earthquake to help them recover economically. Many merchants were very grateful for our presence there."

The organisation of the trip was superb from the time we first made our enquiry until the moment we left Kathmandu to fly home. Rajan answered our emails quickly and his responses to our questions before our trip were great and put our minds to rest about problems we thought we might encounter. When we arrived in Kathmandu our driver was waiting with our name clearly shown which was a great relief as Kathmandu airport is a bit overwhelming after a long flight. We were quickly taken to our hotel (Thamel Eco resort) where we were given a warm welcome and quickly taken to our rooms. The flight from Katmandu to Lukla was delayed because of poor visability and eventually cancelled until the next day. Our guide Namar, arranged for our transport back to the hotel and we were given our original rooms back for the night. Next day the flight was again delayed but Namar managed to get some of us on a plane and the rest onto a helicopter to make sure we could start our trek without any further delay. He really deserved his tip just for these efforts alone as after we arrived in Lukla all flights were again cancelled.The rest of the EBC trek was superb as were the porters that we had waiting for our arrival in Lukla. Everyone was very friendly in the tea houses that we stayed in and the food was great considering where we were. Eventually after 8 hard days we made it to EBC, all made possible by the crew that looked after us day and night. Don\u2019t underestimate the effects from the altitude and follow what the guide tells you to do, and drink lots of water.On arrival back in Katmandu we met Rajan again and were taken to a cultural evening. Our guide also joined us on a night which will be remembered for a long time, superb food, drink and entertainment. We were a group of 7 and everyone had the same opinion. If going to Nepal again we would not hesitate to book with Earthbound Expeditions. Contact Rajan for help advice and you will not be disappointed."

We arranged the trip via email with Rajan Simkhada. He was always timely in responding and answering all questions. The trip was great, and we loved our guide Maule Tamang. He was very experienced (he has been to base camp over 100 times and has even summited Everest). He flew with us out of Kathmandu, and back at the end of the trek. He looked after all our needs. The two porters we had did an excellent job, and our belongings were always waiting for us when we arrived at the teahouses. The teahouses were very basic, and we were grateful that we had sleeping bags. The extra time on the trek allowed us to acclimatize to the elevation. We had minimal symptoms of altitude sickness. While trekking we were never rushed by Maule. The extra time after the trek allowed us to not worry about potential flight delays out of Lukla (it wasn't). It also gave us time to relax in Kathmandu (we got a massage) and take a half day tour to Bhaktapur. We highly recommend Earthbound Expeditions, and you will be lucky if you get Maule Tamang as your guide."

However since the earthquake in 2015 the number tourists has dropped dramatically. The tourism business being the main business of the country is greatly affected. So just by hiring a guide and a porter you have already help to boost the industry. My favorite view was from Tolka. Couldn\u2019t be more lucky in terms of rain and hail stone.

            "review": "The Trip of A Lifetime. This is the company to choose! With plenty of heart and sincerity, Earthbound Expedition is definitely set to impress. I chose the Annapurna Circuit trek for the lack of time and did the trek in a total of 11 days, with the firstand last day dedicated for rest and sightseeing. Rajan the owner, was a lovely help. He responded to our emails and enquires with patience and was genuinely interested in assisting us instead of simply sending us a template response which many of the other companies we contacted did. The itinerary provided was comprehensive and easy to understand and covered our meals and when necessary, sleeping bags and down jackets, which will cost you a substantial amount should you choose to purchase. Being the first time I had ever trekked, taking this expedition on served to be a daunting task ahead for me as I did not know what to expect.Should you choose to do the Annapurna circuit, be prepared to climb a lot of steps! DO NOT skimp on purchasing the right shoes, and if you are trekking during the cold season - gloves and socks. These will serve you very well. Also, ensure that you have clothes that you can layer so that you need not carry too many bulky items. As we were trekking near the end of winter (February), which is the off peak season, we experienced a whole host of temperatures from 29 degrees celcsius all the way to -15 degrees celsius at Annapurna Base Camp.I had requested for Maule, upon reading the excellent reviews by our fellow reviewers below. Maule truly impressed. He has plenty of experience under his belt which greatly assured us, given that the trek does come with it's danger and risks with the unpredictable weather and relatively challenging terrain. I had bought gloves that were not effective in staving off the cold during our trek to ABC and the lovely Maule had actually switched gloves with me in order to prevent me from getting frostbite. Our porter Ong Chun was also a lovely help and boy it is a miracle how they can shoulder such weight and leap from one shaky rock to the other! He was a lovely humble and sincere man as well, just like Maule. I will definitely be requesting for them should I consider pursuing the Everest Base Camp in future. Nepal is a truly a beautiful country. It is a pity that this city of wonderful friendly people has had the series of misfortunes befall them, with the earthquake and political situation. When I arrived and went sightseeing on the first day, it was clear the lack of infrastructure and the recent earthquake had greatly shaken up the country, the economy and the tourism industry. If you are considering travelling to Nepal and trekking, you should go ahead and do it. The view, people and the experience is truly one you will remember for the rest of your life. Just ensure you do plenty of research, pack well, and go in with an open, flexible and accepting mindset as plans may change due to unforseen circumstances. Discuss the best possible alternative with your guide should you require any changes and DO NOT give the children chocolate as it encourages a bad cycle of entitlement and destroys their self-esteem in the long run.Do not drink water from the tap, ice drinks or eat salads and fresh fruits. Only eat freshly prepared food to prevent the very prevalent stomach bugs from reaching you and you should be fine and experience the trip of a lifetime!Cheers and wishing all future trekkers the best of luck!"

The trek itself was the most wonderful I have done to date. Walking through mountain scenery and seeing village life in the foothills of the Annapurna region was the highlight of the trek. I recommend it to anyone. The trek was capped at both ends with a stay in Kathmandu, a dynamic city. EE provided a fantastic tour of Kathmandu\u2019s sights and history as well. We also spent two nights in Pokhara and undertook a cooking class on daal bhat. Mr. Rajan and Shreeram and the porter crew ensured that the trek went without problems. But as always approach trekking in Nepal with an open mind and accept the daily adventures that come along as that is where all the memories come from.I am thoroughly impressed with Earthbound Expeditions and will not hesitate to call upon them for my return trips to Nepal! Earthbound Expeditions is a professional company who adheres to safety and ensures its clients get what they came for! Their services are first class!"

Then I thought I might try trekking to the Everest Base Camp. I wanted to use a local trekking company and after doing internet searches, found the Earthbound Expeditions. An exchange of e-mails started in September 2015 with Rajan. He provided detailed information, a list of items to take and also answered my questions promptly. On reaching Kathmandu on 16 November, I was met by a representative of the company, who took me to a hotel. After meeting Kedar on the following day, I was taken on a sightseeing tour of the city. This was very enjoyable. In the evening, I met my Shyam - my guide for the journey. The day after we flew to Lukla, met my ported Prem and stiff for trekking.It was sunshine with clear skies most of the days. We were surrounded by mountains and the scenery was breathtakingly beautiful. Walking along the river, crossing suspension bridges to get to the guest houses perched on hills and meeting fellow travellers is an experience that will remain with me for a very long time.Accommodation used along the route was very good. The guide and the porter were very helpful. The service received from the company exceeded my expectations. I would certainly use them again. I have no hesitation at all in recommending Earthbound Expeditions."

            "review": "We would use this Tour Group again without hesitation!. This is going to be long - in order to cover some facts as well as give an adequate description of the nature and spirit of the group. I hope it\u2019s helpful.First, let me clarify some things that might be confusing: When we booked our tour it was through Bohemian Tours located in West Bengal, India, and we originally got our information about them via an excellent website of the same name. For airport pickup, however, we were told to look for a sign that said either Bohemian Tours or Earthbound Expeditions. From that point on Earthbound Expeditions was the name used. Also, the listing says Day Tours, which could be misleading. Earthbound Expeditions offers tours of various lengths, from 1 day to 16 or more. I want to add that generally we\u2019re not \"tour\" people (or we didn\u2019t think we were.) We love exploring on our own and an organized tour like this wouldn\u2019t usually be something we\u2019d choose. What happened is that I came across it in a Groupon promotion with a price that was tempting, so I investigated further. Their website was so impressive that I convinced my husband and son to give it a try. Ours was the 8-day Taste of Nepal tour. Our initial communications with Tara, the International Director, were always prompt and clear. The website is extremely well done, providing useful information about flight booking, possible side excursions, vaccinations, money exchange, voltage/electrical requirements, travel insurance, visas, what to bring....and specifics regarding the food, water, weather, accommodations, etc. (with useful links where appropriate.) I highly recommend reading it thoroughly. This same level of care and attention to detail was present in all our dealings with them. Shortly before we were to leave the U.S., Tara sent a letter with additional instructions and offered to answer any last minute questions we had. He provided information about airport pickup and gave us names & numbers for contacts in Nepal in the event we ran into difficulties. One of those individuals, Rajan, was at our hotel to meet us and remained in touch during the tour, though he turned us over to Kumar, who was our guide throughout. It turned out that our group (with the exception of one day, when we were joined by 2 women from Australia) consisted only of my husband, son, 4 year-old granddaughter & me. It was clear to us that this would not be a lucrative venture for the company, yet no corners were cut. Kumar covered everything on the Itinerary and more. He also was attentive to our particular interests. On the way to Chitwan National Park, as we drove along the river, we saw suspension bridges leading to the bank on the other side. These looked intriguing and when we commented, Kumar asked if we\u2019d like to cross one. When we got to a good stopping place he had the driver drop us off so we all could cross, take photos and explore a bit. Obviously this was an advantage of being a small group. In a larger group it might not have been possible, though I\u2019d venture to say that in any size group Kumar would do his best to be accommodating. He\u2019s extremely knowledgeable and provided an abundance of information about the history and culture at each site we visited. Many times this was more than we could absorb at once and he was infinitely patient with our questions \u2013 even when he had to repeat things he'd already told us. He was always helpful and professional, yet over the days we spent with him we also came to view him as our friend. He went above and beyond anything we ever could have expected - even helping to carry our tired little one at times when the rest of us were worn out. In addition to Kumar, Deepak, the driver, was with us throughout the trip. Although he didn\u2019t speak much English, he communicated with a ready smile. He was always prompt, pleasant and helpful, handling precarious traffic and roads with skill and apparent ease. From our arrival in Kathmandu until we left, our days were filled with an amazing array of activities. It was a perfect mix of scheduled and \"free\" or individual time to explore (or rest!) as we chose. Seeing the ancient temples, stupas and shrines was fascinating. The beauty and history \u2013 there was so much to take in. The streets of Kathmandu were bustling, with rich colors and eye-catching architectural elements everywhere, even on the simplest structures. We loved seeing the medieval city of Bhaktapur, a World Heritage Site. There\u2019s still much to marvel at, despite the fact that particular area suffered a tremendous amount of damage in the April 2015 earthquake. Chitwan Park was almost tropical in spots \u2013 serene and beautiful. Among many other things, we were thrilled to see a mother white rhinoceros nestled under a shrub with her calf. We booked our trip prior to the earthquake. Apparently quite a few people were put off by the quake & rumors of widespread damage and cancelled previously made plans to visit. We did give it consideration, primarily because of safety concerns but after some research we determined it was safe to proceed. Moreover, we understood that one of the things crucial to the country's recovery is the return of tourist dollars. As far as earthquake-related damage, we definitely saw some, as well as many repairs and restoration - both completed and underway. During our time there, however, we were much more aware of the economic and social impact of the new constitution Nepal ratified in September. A significant effect of this - and there are various takes on exactly why - is that the borders between Nepal and its neighbor, India, have been blocked. Nepal is dependent on India for the majority of its trade and this has caused a restriction on the transport of goods including petroleum, cooking fuel, medicines, and many other supplies and daily necessities. Almost every aspect of life in the country has been affected - many restaurants were forced to shut down or convert to restricted menus because of food & fuel shortages. Petro lines snake through the streets, with people waiting 2 to 3 days to put gas in their cars and work vehicles. These factors didn\u2019t have a huge impact on our trip, though there was the difficulty of riding in a comfortable, spacious van, looking out at others stuffed into busses and even riding on bus roofs in order to make best use of precious petroleum. The restricted menus were a bit of a disappointment but paled with the recognition of how difficult it was for the restaurant owners simply to remain open. As foodies, we\u2019d looked forward to some exotic meals and especially the Indian spices. The meals that were included with the tour were always ample, good and hearty. They were not highly spiced and we learned that\u2019s probably typical of Nepalese food. Our free-time meal experiences were somewhat hit-and-miss. Because of the shortages, places that had previously received high recommendations might not be open or \u2013 if open \u2013 might only be offering salads (and not always too exciting.) We did come across one sure bet for both food and atmosphere and that was the New Orleans Caf\u00e9 in Thamel, Kathmandu. Unlike it sounds, this restaurant has a large menu and offers an amazing variety of food - everything from hummus to Tandoori chicken to Thai curries - and everything we tried was good. In addition, it had a charming ambience. Once we discovered It, we ate there 2 or 3 times. Another excellent place we didn\u2019t find until one of our last days in the city was the Roadhouse Caf\u00e9, also in Kathmandu. They had wood-fired pizza, so were unaffected by the lack of fuel and the pizza was outstanding! Amendments to the constitution apparently are being considered even as I'm writing this and it's hoped that the situation will be resolved in the near future. For us, we were glad we didn't cancel. Both Kumar and the tour group as a whole let us know they were glad too. They did everything possible to make our trip memorable. They showed great willingness to be flexible, helping us negotiate an unexpected schedule glitch (on our part) and also arranging airport transportation for us at the end of some additional personal days we spent in the country. In summary, Earthbound Expeditions/Bohemian Tours is a first rate organization. We thank them for their kindness and proficiency and for helping to make our visit to Nepal such a great success. We\u2019re considering a trip to India at some point in the future and will most definitely seek them out again."

I stayed with Rajan and his family for a homestay before and after the tour. I would highly recommend this as well as the wonderful cooking class given by his wife.

We booked our trek from Pokhara to the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) with Earthbound Expeditions (run by Rajan), and would highly, highly recommend you do the same. This was one of the best things we did in Nepal and we had an absolutely terrific time. Email Rajan before you go to Nepal to start setting things up, rather than getting approached on the streets of Kathmandu by someone who wants to sell you their (probably less amazing) tour. Rajan laid out all the pieces of the trip by email and was very responsive to any changes or questions we had. Once we arrived in Kathmandu he met us in person at our hotel (booked for you by Earthbound) before our trek began. He arranged for a private guided tour of Kathmandu, which was a good way to see the big sites across the city and to adjust to the time difference before setting off. The one small hiccup was that after getting transferred to the Kathmandu airport for our flight to Pokhara (again, arranged by Earthbound), the airline didn\u2019t have a proper record of our flight. It\u2019s unclear whose mistake this was, but all it meant was that we missed our 8:30am flight and we called Rajan who sorted it all out for us by phone with the airline, and we just took the next flight at 9:30 \u2013 no big deal.The trek itself is an unbelievable and rewarding experience, especially if you can make it up to ABC. Certain sections are definitely strenuous (e.g. getting to Ghandruk/Chommrong via thousands of stairs), but there are also flat sections and we took plenty of breaks. The guide we were provided by Earthbound (Maule) met us at the airport in Pokhara and if you go with Earthbound, definitely request him. He\u2019s an incredibly experienced mountaineer, having grown up near Everest and having summited many of the major peaks in the Himalayas. He\u2019s funny, speaks very good English, and we felt totally safe and comfortable with him. Through observation in the early stages of our trek he learned our pace, adjusted his pace as necessary, and recognized when we needed a break for water or a tea. He pointed out all kinds of things you\u2019d never know/notice on your own, and really made the entire thing run incredibly smoothly. You can do the trek to ABC on your own, there\u2019s really only 1 route and you can ask any of the other trekkers along the way, but having a guide is great, and if you are debating who to use, use Earthbound (and ask for Maule)!"

I'm not one for writing reviews good or bad, but after having such a fabulous trip to Nepal last October I felt the need to leave some positive feed back about this beautiful country. Through a recommendation I booked my holiday with Earthbound Expeditions about five weeks prior to my trip and they were fantastic. They accommodated me as a solo traveler despite not having any treks scheduled for the period of time I was traveling in Nepal. Nothing was too much trouble for them, from the hotel staff in Katmandu & Pokhara to the President of earthbound , Rajan who made every effort to make sure my trip was tailored for what I wanted to do. I ended up doing the Poon hill trek, which was fabulous and relatively easy, along with some white water rafting. My guide, Ray was very knowledgable and enthusiastic, which made the trip even more enjoyable, if that's possible!Nepal is a fantastic, extremely friendly and very safe country to visit despite all It's problems after the earthquake and the ongoing fuel shortage. I would encourage anyone who likes a little bit of adventure to visit Nepal, it was everything I expected and more, and you won't go far wrong if you let Earthbound Expeditions organise your trip for you.

We have always been pleased with the professional, friendly and prompt attention provided by Rajan, president of the company. He has been very helpful in customizing trips to suit our needs and always selects good guides and drivers.There are many things to do in Sri Lanka. We especially enjoyed exploring the historical sites that had once been capitals of the country. Hiking to and exploring Buddhist pilgrimage sites such as Sigiriya fortress, Mihinthale and Dambulla Rock Cave Temple were also highlights of the trip. Visually the island extends from coastal beaches to cool lush green hills where large tea plantation hills are located."

The trip with earthbound expeditions was incredible. There is nothing I repeat nothing like staying in the hills of the Himalayas, in simple cabins, huddled in your sleeping bags and blankets, bed at 8 or 9 pm, simple but lovely lovely food made by the house owner (what id give for more dhal bat, momos and those Nepalese fried breads!). Nothing like knowing how far you've trekked that day and that you've finally arrived in your destination for the day. Nothing like seeing rolling hills 2000metres below, or the sunset over the mighty peaks across the way. Our guide was amazing, Thakur Sapkota. He took care if us like a brother or father, and I never doubted him. Of all the groups (there were three in our 'trip') I was glad he was our guide. Nepal felt safe, fun, wonderful people, cheap and good value, most beautiful scenery. I was definitely shocked at the poverty when arriving, but quickly realised it was safe and you get accustomed to it. I'm so shocked and horrified by the recent earthquakes - life is just not fair for this poor gem of a country. Nepal was rising as a traveller destination - continue one and all I say. I would love to go back and plan to - I never got to chitwan national park! I wish to see her (Nepal) rise up again."

We had a guided tour around all the landmarks of Kathmandu and we went to Nagarkot and Bakthapur. We eventually flied to Pokhara. The highlight of our trip was the 6 day trek through the Annapurna Region. The hikes were not particularly hard however, there were enough brakes at teahouses or viewpoints so that our youngest one (11 years old) could also keep up. Even when it got more difficult due to snow and ice, the enthusiastic guide Ramchandra Sapkota and the very friendly porters Padam, Kedar and \u2026 were very helpful and made sure nothing would happen to us. Ramchandra could tell us a lot about Nepal\u2019s history, culture and nature. We spend the nights in lodges which provided us with all out basic needs like a warm welcome, a fireplace, good food, clean rooms, often even WIFI access and sometimes a hot shower. After the trek we traveled by bus to Chitwan National Park. Again the accommodation was perfectly organized. We spend 3 days with a guide in the jungle, either on foot, on an elephant, with a jeep or in a canoe. After this we flied back to Kathmandu to fly home from there."

It was our first visit to Nepal, and EE were fantastic.I was a little nervous booking online, especially as sending a deposit in dollars was a MASSIVE faff, but as soon as we met Rajan at the hotel our worries were put to bed. Rajan was very professional, and the hotel (Eco Resort) was clean and well-staffed. Whilst in Kathmandu we had a day tour to various temples and sights, which was a great way to get a feel for the (hideously dirty but very interesting) city and find our way around.We chose to do the Gokyo Lakes, Cho La Pass and Everest Base Camp trek, which was very reasonably priced. Our tour guide, Ram, was very friendly and informative, and did everything within his power to get us on a plane to Lukla when the first day's flights were cancelled due to bad weather. Throughout the trek Ram was fantastic - he organised things to suit us, including pausing the trek for 24 hours when I got the mother of all colds, carrying packs when I twisted my ankle, and offering advice, medicine and good company. We were delighted to make it to the lakes, the pass and EBC, and Ram and our porter Nima were fantastic the whole way. The trek itself was breathtaking, so many beautiful views, and although a real physical challenge, was definitely doable for anyone with a decent base fitness level. Still can't get over quite how cold it was at night when we were at altitude, but many of the tea houses provided extra blankets if you asked.An element which really highlights the fantastic customer service was when we returned to Kathmandu. Back in the hotel, I sadly suffered from a bout of food poisoning, and Rajan helped my husband to get the right antibiotics, and re-booked a party due to arrive in our room that day so that I would not also have to move rooms whilst suffering. (I'm making this sound like so many things went wrong... seriously, it was an amazing experience, and EE fixed every minor issue.)I've recommended EE, Rajan, Ram and Nima to anyone who has mentioned trekking in Nepal, and will continue to do so as their service was so fantastic."

Both were attentive, helpful, friendly, fun, knowledgeable and went beyond the call of duty to make our trek a very memorable experience.Due to bad weather we couldnt make it over the Larkya La pass, which was disappointing but we fully trusted the advice of Mahendra, and pleased we took the safe option of turning around. In fact, it turned into a positive experience, as M knew a different way to trek out and so we returned via the amazing villages of Laprak, Barpak and the town of Gorkha.

It also felt safer in case something went wrong. We compared prices from several operators and EB was the cheapest. We thought a porter was a non-negotiable but in the end we had only a small bag that he carried and we just carried the water\u2026so you can maybe negotiate about a porter (though he bought such personality to the trip it was well worth the cost!). While this trek is listed as an easy one, I would caution people who don't like lots of stairs up and down! If you are going in Winter take some crampons with for the few snowy/icy patches. Accommodation is basic but pleasant. Food prices on the menus along the way were as high as Thamel, as stuff often needs to be brought in by donkey for the tourists.

As a solo female traveler, I felt that joining a group trek with a guide would be the safest choice. When I was in Katmandu, I was fully prepared to purchase some Dimox (altitude sickness medication) in case I got sick which is a very common occurrence amongst trekkers to this region but my guide told me he had some and that I would not have to buy any.Four days into the hike, I became ill, with severe nausea and severe headache. I asked for the pills and the guide would not give them to me and said I wasn't \"sick enough\" for the pills. The next day the symptoms intensified and he still wouldn't give me any pills. Had he forgotten them and felt to embarrassed, I am sure he could have gotten some from another guide since they are cheap and plentiful in the area.....but he felt no sense of responsibility. On the third day of suffering from the altitude sickness I was unable to sleep because of shallow breathing and consequentially began to slow down considerably when hiking. The guide and sherpas proceeded to complain about my slowed walking speed right to my face which was totally rude seeing as how if they had have held up there end of the deal, I wouldn't have gotten sick in the first place. Point being - there is no point to going with this company. You pay all that extra money and there is no accountability. You may as well organize your own Sherpa which is very easy, get your own trekking permit - simple again, make a trip to the pharmacy and pick up some pills in case of emergency. Go it alone and spare yourself the aggravation."

Rajan was fantastic at answering all of our questions and liaising with an associated your agent in Sri Lanka. Everything went extremely smoothly and all our requests were met perfectly. I would highly recommend Earthbound."

Managable distances for the children, excellent organisation, loadsa playful interactions with our crew and locals.... What more do u want! With stunning views of Fishtail and the Annapurna range, we are all excited for our next trip to the Himalayas. Our 9-year old son even said, he'll come to Everest basecsmp with me when he is 16!!!!

This was a holiday meant to be different from the rest that we\u2019ve had. This holiday was like an adventure \u2026 trekking, rafting and coming up close with the animals at the Chitwan National Park! The city folks that we are enjoyed the experience thoroughly and earned ourselves some bragging rights!We were lucky to have the help of Earthbound Expeditions who helped plan the itinerary and arranged for everything\u2026 ground transport, domestic flights, hotels, an experienced trekking guide and porters, a knowledgeable city guide etc. What really set Earthbound Expeditions apart is the personal and prompt service of its managing director, Rajan. Rajan pays attention to the details, was contactable at all times and was very flexible with our last minute changes. And the fees charged for all that? HALF the amount quoted to us by a local agent in Singapore! I had compared apples to apples\u2026 same activities, same / similar accommodations in the cities etc. Nepal has lots to offer \u2026 so I say \u2026 we\u2019ll be back!"

After contacting several agencies, my wife and I selcted Earthbound Expeditions for our trip in Nepal and Bhutan based on a number of factors. First, Rajan (owner) responded to our questions with specific responses that actually answered our questions. None of the other four agencies we contacted did that. Second, Earthbound Expeditions is locally owned and operated, and it made a difference to us to know that local people would benefit from our visit. And third, Rajan was kind to tailor the trip to our needs while suggeting some tweaks that would (and did) result in a great experience.We did the Annapurna circuit. We had a great guide in Lekh and a great porter in Naram. Both of them were extremely kind, and they were also very smart with logistics - to the point where we usually got to the best lodges, ate great food and did not waste any time looking for lodging and/or transportation during the peak season. We had to reroute our trip due to the big October snowstorm, and we were glad to have Lekh and Naram with us to descend safely and with minimal disruptions. During the storm aftermath, Rajan also took good care of us remotely by rerouting our itinerary (including some domestic flights) and letting our family know we were fine.Rajan also arranged for us a few days in Bhutan, where we were under care of a partner company that also treated us extremely well.All in all, these were probably the best vacations we ever had and we thank Rajan and his team at Earthbound Expeditions for a wonderful work. We would not hesitate to go straight to them again."

Earthbound Expeditions provided us with full information before we led the UK, replying within hours (and sometimes within minutes!) to our emails and queries.Earthbound Expeditions took very good care of us while we were in Nepal, including being invited to Rajan's home to celebrate Divali with his family. Being invited to share in such a occasion was very special.We can not speak highly enough of our guide Lekh, who was excellent. He was highly knowledgable and did everything possible to ensure our trek was a wonderful experience. His customer service was first class. When problems did occur, such as one of our group experiencing altitude sickness, he found solutions to enable us to continue our trek. Similarly, when we unable to fly out of Jomson due to high winds stopping flights, Lekh arranged a jeep to take us to Pokhara so we could stay on schedule for the trip (I would not recommend the jeep, unless you have to meet an international flight as we did, as the road is so rough it can be hardly called a road and the 139km journey by road took 9 hours). Lekh's excellent guiding, calm problem solving and quiet reassurance was very much appreciated by all of us. The food was excellent and the tea houses and hotels were basic and cold at night as you would expect, but very welcoming. As we wanted a walk while we were at Jomson, Lekh even found a \u2018side trip\u2019 for us the afternoon, to a neighbouring village.The porters, Shiva and Balpu, worked equally hard on our behalf going to of their way to help us, and when they reached the hotel before us in the afternoon, came back and offered to help with our small packs. Their attentiveness at all times helped make the trek a memorable experience.Needless to say the scenery was glorious and our thanks go to Earthbound Expeditions team for a highly enjoyable (and challenging!) trek. i would recommend Earthbound Expeditions to anyone considering trekking in Nepal."

All of our plans were executed flawlessly and perfectly thanks to Earthbound. Our guide, Gopal, and porter Kaji on the Annapurna Circuit were simply the best! Our overland trip to Tibet was awesome and winding down with a few days at Chitwan was the perfect way to end our adventure. Thanks to Rajan and his incredible staff we had another spectacular tour.

All activities were organized by Rajan as described in the itinerary from A to Z, including ground transport to/from airport, trail head and trek itself. If we were to be met by a driver or guide at a particular time, then this really happened. The hotel in Kathmandu, while located in the chaos of the city, was tucked away in an oasis of quiet. The room for first night was near the noisy bar/eating area, but this was more than offset by the great suite we received on the last night after the trek.We were there for the Poon Hill trek and we were not disappointed. The company means it when it says that trail speed is not important \u2013 it\u2019s about going slowly enough to absorb the experience (that\u2019s why we saw the monkeys). Even so, we always reached the day\u2019s goal in sufficient time to unwind, shower and have dinner.If you can, ask for Maule to be your guide. He\u2019s extremely knowledgeable and will talk to you about any topic from things you see on the trail to life in Nepal. You\u2019ll make a friend by the end of the trip. He will set an appropriate pace and won\u2019t whip you along the trail like some other guides we heard about. On the trail, he organized all meals and overnight stays. A couple of times at lower altitudes when one of us was struggling with the heat, he took our pack in addition to his own for the rest of the day."

We had done a lot of research regarding which tour company to use and wanted to make sure it was Nepalese owned and operated to support the local community. After reading impressive reviews of this company, we booked online with them for our tour which was 12 days. We were very happy with our choice! Rajan, the president, answered our many questions over the period of weeks leading up to the trip. He met us at our hotel in Kathmandu the first day of our trip and also the last day to ensure we enjoyed our time there. Our tour consisted of the following:- arrival day- one day in Kathmandu to see the many temples the city has to offer- a travel day to Pokhara- a 4 day trek of the Annapurna Circuit, including Poon Hill- a day in Pokhara to see the sights- 2 1/2 day safari in Bardiya National Park- one last day in KathmanduThe trekking part of the trip was absolutely amazing! The trail is tough as there endless stairs to climb up from Nayapul to get to Poon Hill/Ghorepani area and then it is back down the endless stairs. All those stairs were worth the trip though. The guides and porters made sure we were well taken care of, both on the trail and once we got to the guesthouses.We chose Bardiya over Chitwan as we had read that the chances of seeing a tiger were much greater and there too many tourists in Chitwan. We were glad we chose Bardiya. The guides were incredible and the lodge that Earthbound Expeditions uses was great! The wildlife viewing was spectacular as we were lucky enough to see a wild tiger not once, but twice! We saw many birds, monkeys, and 3 rhinos. We didn't see any wild elephants in the area but they were definitely there as a guy on a domestic elephant was chased by one while we were out on our safari. Overall, Earthbound ensured we had an excellent trip and we wouldn't hesitate to use them again in the future. A few suggested improvements for the company include:- ensuring guides can speak very good English. Some guides were better than others as was expected but we ended up talking to another Earthbound guide for the majority of the trekking- ensuring the guides are well aware of the itinerary of the individual groups. Because we were going into Bardiya, not Chitwan, we had one less day in the Annapurna region which he did not realize until we brought it to his attention. It did cause a bit of a hiccup in our plans but we managed to work around it.Thanks Earthbound for a wonderful experience!"

However, our guides and porters made it possible. We were a very diverse group of 10 and by the end of the trek we were all friends. On the first day one of our porters Ramjee Bhatta stayed behind to bring up some luggage that had been lost in route to Kathmandu. He covered in a couple of hours what had taken us all day. With a smile on his face. The accommodations on trek, while spartan, were totally adequate and quite comfortable. The food was much better than I expected. I have done a fair amount of travel and this was one of my best experiences. It is difficult for me to put into words how life changing this trip was. Imagine 5 days without seeing a vehicle with wheels? All transport being on foot. And yet we had internet service at night. Meeting people from all over the world and still being in contact with them 7 months later. Not only did we experience incredible landscape beauty and physical challenges, we made friends. Ramjee was among those making this happen. Not only did he carry our bags he was more of an assistant guide, told us about his culture and was a great cheerleader. I would highly recommend making this trek."

Our guide Namaraj was great, informative and entertaining. He even ran back an hour to our lodge to retrieve the kids' Kindles that were left behind! Thanks also to our porters Harry and Bhadri who held our kids' hands over the difficult bits whilst carrying our stuff. Even when we chose a different rafting company than Earthbound use, Rajan and Namaraj still arranged private transfers for us at no extra charge.

Trust me this organisation babies you the whole way leaving you to enjoy the hike, the food, the scenery and the wonderful people. Here are some tips. Go in October which is sunny and warm.Take the rafting option. Use hand santizer often. Bring power bars. Bring aqua tabs and flavored electrolyte tablets. Bring flip flops and micro fibre towels. Use zip lock bagsto separate your items. Bring a emergency poncho as well as a thin water proof jacket. I would allow two days n Katmandu prior to the tour and take a day tour of the city but leave the day the tour ends. The tiger hunt part of this tour was especially interesting as we stayed in a nice resort in Chitwan park and actually herded a nasty rino on while riding the elephants.

We never had to wait for a car and the drivers were extremely friendly.We were greeted at the Kathmandu airport where a car was waiting to take us to Nagarkot. The next morning another car was avialble to take us to Pokhara. Because of the rules of sightseeing within Pokhara, you are only allowed to use the local transport people. So they have worked out a deal with Pokhara tour agents to arrange day tours for their customers. We did not have to pay separately or tip separately for anything. Everything was arranged and taken care of. We took all the little detours to Mankamana temple and Begnas lake on our way back to Pokhara and our driver never complained.

Traveling to Nepal not only gives us a feel and appreciates the diversity in all aspects, it also gives a new definition of what customer service means. The good feelings my family experienced makes us loyal and satisfied customers of Earthbound Expeditions. From the initial stage of trip enquiry, tailor-making of our itinerary to the execution phase, it was a relief to know that all of the logistical details had been taken care of and still we can modify the itinerary while on the trip. Thanks to Rajan and team especially Arjun for putting together such a great trip for us. Rajan\u2019s follow up calls when we were at Chitwan was heart-warming. Even though we are back in Singapore, we are surprise to receive greetings through Rajan\u2019s email. What a great after-sales service. Having traveled to numerous countries, I single Nepal as being my favourite country. What could be so good about it? Earthbound Expeditions make us, as customers, feel special and important."

Both regions allow you to really appreciate the inspiring beauty in spirituality and religious piety. We do not see this in the West anymore, unfortunately. Go soon because the culture, even in once remote Tibet, is changing due to secular influences. We also witnessed some of the most breath-taking natural wonders of the world. Trekking through the Himalayas, I was able to witness the most beautiful, majestic, and terrifying mountain range mankind has ever encountered. And learning about the history of the region really makes you feel small and realize that, as a Westerner, your perspective on the world really is limited.Earthbound Expeditions, along with Tibet Kyunglung Travel Service, made this all possible. Rajan was a great organizer for the trip. He was always prompt in returning our emails and answered all of our concerns, and he took care of all of the fine details, including transportation, stay, and food. We recommend Earthbound Expeditions with the highest enthusiasm, and we hope that you will be able to, and humble enough, and make it to the roof of the world."

I didn't take long to decide on Earthbound Expeditions. Email responses from Rajan were quick. Our itinerary consisted of trekking, rafting, jungle safari and sightseeing, suited my children age 17, 15, 7. Charges were reasonable, no hidden costs. We had the best guide, Arjun Adhicari who is confident trekking guide with excellent track record and speaks excellent English. We met as strangers but end up as friends. My eldest son fell ill since arriving Nepal. Arjun and the porters were well-equipped with first aid box. I am thankful for that because the medicines I brought were finished. And thanks for their care to my 7-year-old son and my eldest son who had fever at the beginning of trip. When we were in Pokhara, we wanted to do paragliding, an optional activity but we had no time. Arjun did not want to disappoint us - he took an extra mile and arranged us to stay one more night in Pokhara and arranged us for the activity. The itinerary was so perfectly modified that we did not miss any programme later on and there was no additional costs we had to pay. Despite monsoon season and my sons' age, the amateurs were able to complete several days of trekking in the villages safely. Our trekking was in the third week of June and we expected rainfall. Contrary to what we know from travel guides, the monsoon was not as bad as what we thought. Rain did not hinder our travel plan. Throughout the entire trekking, there were only two occasions of a 10-15 minutes showers. At most times weather was cloudy and occasional sunshine. Things were cheaper in low season and accommodation, restaurants had few guests, hence, the advantages to travel during low season outweighs the advantage during peak season. Change in schedule, according to our guide Arjun, was easier to manage. This is our best holiday. Naturally Nepal - once is not enough...we will come back to explore another part of Nepal in the near future. A returning customer next round and hopefully we can meet Arjun, our trekking mentor, again. I recommend Earthbound Expeditions to anyone and family who looks for professional, personalized fun-filled tour package."

He looked after us every day and ensured we had a comfortable, fun and enjoyable trip. It was great listening to all his trek stories. His English was flawless and we had no problems communicating with him. In the end, he was our friend, not just our guide.

Before leaving for Nepal we had numerous conversations with Mr. Rajan over emails and he was always prompt with his replies. Once we reached KTM, a Tata Grande was sent for us which was extremely well maintained. Our driver/ guide Mr. Manoj was too good. Extremely patient, knowledgeable and a safe driver. We enjoyed his company for the whole time we were there. We had also booked the mountain flight to see the Everest through Earthbound Expeditions and Mr. Rajan gave us the most reasonable rates. That flight was the highlight of our trip and I would highly recommend this flight to everyone visiting KTM.Another tip that Mr. Rajan gave us was to go for the Aarti at Pashupatinath at 7pm which was a magical experience. Almost like being on the Ganga ghats at Benaras. If it hadn't been for Mr. Rajan's suggestion we would have just gone to Pashupatinath during the day.

The best organized and most enjoyable trekking experience among any of my guided trekking experiences abroad so far. Our group of 12 was quite varied in age, but everyone bonded and had a wonderful time trekking, eating together and lodging at the guesthouses along the trail. Our guide Pravin was very organized, gave informative daily briefings, answered all of our questions, and made sure everyone was taken care of and accounted for on the trail even with our different ability levels as well as ensuring we were well taken care of at meals and for our overnight accommodations. Pravin and our 4 porters were very helpful, cheerful, friendly and encouraging the entire trek and made the group feel like a big family. We started as a group of strangers but ended feeling like a group of friends who I hope to see again. This was truly the trip of a lifetime!! I would not hesitate to return and trek with Pravin again in the future in Nepal"

Knowing that we had a particular interest in agriculture in Nepal, he went out of his way to answer questions and share extra information on this topic. We had an amazing sunrise over the Himalayas, a great stop for tea and Nepalese donuts, and an introduction to Nepalese lifestyle and culture unlike what we could have gotten anywhere else. Both Shree Ram and the driver were prompt, courteous, and professional.We couldn't be happier and hope we have the opportunity to go out with Earthbound Expeditions and Shree Ram again."

I also value the fact that they are an environmentally and socially conscious company.I did the 8 day Langtang Valley trek and absolutely loved it! It was important to me to feel comfortable with my guide as I was a solo female traveller. Rajan paired me up with Mitra as my guide/porter for this trip and it was no problem when I requested I meet him first, which I did the day before we left.Mitra means 'friend' and that he was. He was so professional for such a young age. Mitra took such good care of me, always making sure I was comfortable and ok. He stuck with me at my pace, made sure I was well catered for at every meal and always had a big friendly smile on his face. I was so very lucky to have Mitra as my guide. Langtang was amazing and Mitra made it even better for me.I hope to go back to Nepal one day and do some more trekking. I will go straight back to Earthbound Expeditions. No need to look elsewhere.

            "review": "rajan of earthbound expeditions is the best. If you are thinking of doing something out of the ordinary, THIS IS IT!!!Just like you, I found Earthbound Expeditions (EE) through the internet and chose them based on all the positive reviews. I haven't written any review in my whole life but I'm doing this because the world out there deserve the best of what Nepal has to offer through the warmth and expertise of the people from Earthbound Expeditions.Even if you are not sure of what you want or where exactly you want to go, the first thing you have to do is go to their website and get in touch (email is the fastest) with Mr. Rajan Simkhada right away. He is the president of Earthbound Expeditions and he will help by giving you an idea of what's best for you based on your time and budget.My friend, Jennifer, and I just finished trekking to Everest Base Camp (EBC). Our guide, Resham, and our porter, Bal, were extraordinary. They provided us with the kind of service that's way beyond our expectation. (Check out Jennifer's review on April 24, 2014).For me, March is the perfect time to go because there were other trekkers but not enough to make it like a circus. I treasured the solemnity that the trails had to offer.Also, the weather was just right. Warm enough so as not to feel like we were freezing (down jacket is important + gloves and head cover will help) but cold enough so that the yak dung on the trail didn't stink.When you are ready to go, the most important thing you have to bring with you is your diamox (to prevent altitude sickness) and your used hiking boots. The rest (I mean, everything else that you will need for the trek, I'm serious!) you can buy at Thamel, good quality for an incredible price. Spending money in Nepal is also a good way to give back to the people who go out of their way to to make your stay a pleasant one.Pack lightly. When I was reading the reviews before my trip, I won't believe what they said about wearing the same clothes for days and not taking a shower. It's true. My socks smelled fresh like they were taken out of the dryer. It was crazy!!! I brought a lot of baby wipes and felt fresh everyday.Next is water. I got Steripen from Costco before my trip and it served us (including our guide and porter) well until the end of our trek. I gave my Steripen to my guide after the trek. (Actually, I left a lot of my stuff with our guide and porter, including water bottles, sleeping bag liner, trekking poles, shirts, a lot of food, etc.) There is bottled water available if budget is not an issue. But you have to remember that everything, yes, everything up there was carried on the backs of either the porters or the animals.Which reminds me to tell you not to bring too much food. We did, which just resulted in excess baggage. All you need to bring are snack items because breakfast, lunch and dinner are provided during the trek. I became a vegetarian during the trek to avoid digestive problems. (We didn't have any.)Bring your camera, it's a photographer's paradise. There is internet almost all the way to EBC. You can also charge your phone, camera, etc for a small price. Buying my power bank was useless.And last but the most important of all, get travel insurance. Despite all the preparations, I caught the flu 3 days before flying to Kathmandu. But still, I made it to Kala Patthar (KP) and the original EBC. I was coughing and my lungs were not strong enough and succumbed to High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) two days after summitting KP. When you are in a very bad situation, you want to have Rajan Simkhada in your corner. One text message to him and the helicopter was on its way to pick us up in Lobuche.Despite 2 days in the hospital in Kathmandu, I believe that this trip will remain on top of all trips. Anyway, for me, the best part of traveling are those that are not part of the itinerary. Six weeks after coming back from Nepal, every now and then, my mind still drifts back to those magical mountains in the Himalayas and the bustling streets of Kathmandu.May you have a safe and fun trip."

New to the field and rather young, he was able to carry our light (to him) load. At dinner we would try to help him with his English. After our trek, I had gotten a stomach flu while in Chitwan, and Ratna stayed by my side, bringing me tea and company while my friends were out exploring. My friends did not enjoy the tour bus ride back to Kathmandu from Chitwan but I on the other hand found it quite the local experience! There were some doomed vehicles that had gone over the cliff at a couple spots on the route and that seemed to worry other travelers that we could be next, but we made it back safe and sound with stories to tell.If I ever find myself back in Nepal, will definitely book with Rajan and Earthbound again. Won't bother looking elsewhere. :)"

Lows secondary to crazy GI issues, but to be normal coming from the USA. Rajan was a great director of the show. All of our guides were amazing, but I can only refer to Apar who was great, several of us could not make it to EBC, so we were accompanied back to a lower level. They did everything they could to make sure our HOliday was perfect. Everything was totally orgainized beyond our expections. Crazy Kathmandu was made relaxed with Earthbound Expeditions. An experience to last a lifetime, a life changer, whatever, but the memories we made with Apar and the gang will last forever. Not a fan of group travel, but we made friends for a lifetime. Keep up the good work."

I loved this company because:It was 100% dependable despite the chaos that is travel in Kathmandu.It practices fair trade and thus its staff is professional and friendly.It is owned by a self made entrepreneur who has local knowledge and a passion for promoting NepalGreat Guides--fun and friendlyloads of extras--I recommend the cooking class hosted by Raj's (the owners) wife which is done at their home-great food-yum!Mistakes I made when booking:I booked my hotel separately because I wanted to upgrade. I stayed at Dwarikas and though it was lovely-I found it to be overpriced and very stuffy. In retrospect I would have been better off at the Thamel EcoHotel that the company manages.I took the bus with the group to Pokahara-8 hours of breathing dust and swerving aound hair pin curves on bumpy roads--spluge for the 100 USD plane ride--30 minutes long and comparably safer.I bought my gear ahead of time. There gear in Thamel (the section of Kathmandu you stay in)and Pokhara was everywhere--and super cheep, e.g. down sleeping bags for 12-20 US dollars, UV light to sterilize water are 20 USD there 200 dollars at home, very nice \"Northfake\" jacket for 20 USD...Bring your own hiking shoes and a good day pack--but buy the rest there--you will save loads.Things I did right:Brought duct tape, O2 canisters and my own meds and plenty hand sanitizer of Toilet PaperHints-donate your boots and other gear at the end of the Trek to Gopal with \"Shoes for Sherpas.\" Your porters will be working hard for the cash you tip them--tip them well and remember that some of them are in need of good foot wear.Biggest Hint--use this company they are fantastic!!!"

I have travelled extensively but never written a review, however; I am so impressed with Earthbound Expeditions that I\u2019m compelled to share my experience with this company whose excellent reputation is obviously well-deserved. A very special thank you to our fantastic guide, Resham, who made our trek so thoroughly enjoyable with his friendly demeanor, wise judgment and exceptional knowledge of the area. Every aspect of our trip was handled so personally and professionally from start to finish which ensured a wonderful experience for my friend Judy Ann and me. I am absolutely effusive about the quality of our trip which was superb in every way. The Thamel Eco Resort in Kathmandu was a delightful place to stay with a friendly, professional staff, excellent food and gorgeous garden. Our city guide, Kumar, was excellent and provided a comprehensive tour of the major sights with in-depth knowledge and fascinating facts. On our trek in the Everest region, Resham took care of us like we were members of his family! The teahouses we stayed in were carefully selected to ensure the highest quality accommodations and sanitary conditions. Resham was always on top of everything and catered to our every need with kindness, compassion and always a smile. Resham went \u201cabove and beyond\u201d to guarantee our comfort, safety and happiness every step of the way. Thank you, Resham!!! The cooperative weather allowed us to spend time in Chitwan National Park which Judy Ann and I really enjoyed. The Jungle Safari Lodge was a beautiful and peaceful place to relax and continue to enjoy nature. Riding an elephant through the jungle and canoeing past crocodiles in the river was awesome! Thank you for suggesting this additional trip and for making the arrangements, expertly, as usual. Rajan and Resham, I will be forever grateful to you for your unsurpassed expertise in handling this memorable lifetime experience. I miss the beauty and culture of Nepal and I will definitely return someday. In the meantime, I have been recommending Earthbound Expeditions to everyone I know! I MISS YOU AND THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING TIME!!! Jennifer OffillCalifornia, USA"

Half of our time in trekking, half of our time in visiting Nepal cities and the national park safari activities. The trekking is extraordinary, we have the best team which make a lot difference, big thank to our guide (Shrek) and our porters, who have looked after us, make us feel in good hand and relief. Its our first time for being so adventure, and i was worried if the kids can manage. However, to my surprise, they did so well, and i am really proud of them. Nepal is a beautiful countries, people we met have been friendly, nature. There are lots to do, other than trekking(though, i highly recommend trekking with Earthbound team, even for a short trip, its a life time experience), rafting, jungle safari in the national park, riding elephant, paragliding. a lot of memories have been brought back, and a few lessons that i hope the kids would carry on throughout their journey of life. big thanks for Rajan professional team.

Namaraj Sapkota has been my guide and companion throughout my visits and always goes the extra mile to see to my comfort and wellbeing. From shopping partner, tour guide, translator and friend, Nama made sure my time was safe and memorable.Anything I needed or problem I came across was solved with a phone call, and I always felt like I was cared about as a valued guest.My plans were pretty loose and I wanted a great deal of flexibility, once this was explained I was given the freedom to choose what to do and when to do it. Even though Rajan was on business out of Nepal the very capable Kadhar saw to my needs. Nepal has plenty to offer the traveller from wild safari, majestic scenery, bustle of life in city or village or peaceful retreat. Earthbound Expeditions have experience, networks and resources to meet any desire. You will not go wrong by engaging in their services."

I was part of a diverse 15-person group and from various countries and of varying ages and fitness levels. Nepal is a gorgeous, amazing country. I'd probably give a 4.8 rating if it were possible because I did have some minor critique's - beware if you travel during rainy times & read up on how to deal with pesky little leeches and know that this culture isn't precise in the timing or scheduling of things ( you might hear: \"may be yes, may be no\"). It's funny if you can just go with the flow and being open-minded, patient and having a sense of adventure. The Nepali people are extremely kind, personable and modest. I found it very easy to converse with all sorts of people there. Our guide, Gopal Neupane, was wonderfully kind, patient, knowledgeable, fun and supportive. He took great care of all of us, especially with those who lagged behind due to altitude sickness, etc. and he was infinitely encouraging, patient and had a good sense of humor. In fact, all the staff, porters (Deepak, Mahesh, etc.)and other guides (Arjun, Rajan) for other groups, were also very kind and encouraging. These young men all work incredibly hard and have the best, positive attitudes in taking care of all our needs from ordering and serving our meals, getting our rooms, and keeping track of us along the trails. They did so much to make sure we were all enjoying ourselves, happy, and safe at all times from before we woke up until after we went to sleep! While the accommodations were \"almost like summer camp\" and adequate, I recommend bringing quick dry clothes and ear plugs and to take all the recommendations the tour gives for what to bring seriously to ensure one is as comfortable and prepared as possible (as there are, of course, no Western style convenience stores up in the mountains!).The natural beauty of the geography, flora, and fauna (elephants, crocs) were almost unbelievable, pictures can only capture a limited portion/shadow of what is really there so I strongly anyone with the least inclination to try it. The group is large enough and has enough porters to help that one can basically go as fast as desired or as slow as needed with many breaks in between for respite, photos and even to buy snacks as needed, so its suitable for all able-bodied people at all fitness levels.Moreover, many of us got to know each other well and I feel I made some genuine life-long friends. Nepal with their ancient, vibrant capital city and those magnificent mountains are a must see and also benefits the Nepali people by bringing in revenue. I can hardly wait until I can go again to see the legendary rhododendrons forests in bloom next time."

It's become somewhat of a yearly tradition for me to help such children - it is my gift to myself, but not knowing anyone in Nepal I did a bit of research and eventually found Earthbound Expeditions headed up by the extremely intelligent, warm, and dynamic Rajan Simkhada. I was extremely impressed by how quickly he responded to my messages at all times of day and even more so when I found out how busy he was with civic and community projects aimed at improving life for the Nepali people and giving back. Their Ganesh Himal Charity trip was a wonderful idea but like so many people today with very little time I did not have the amount of time necessary to do take this tour. I explained to Rajan my situation and what I wanted to do and he custom made an itinerary to accommodate my wishes. I was sincerely impressed with his staff such as Shreeram Adhikari who outside of trekking up to the earth's highest point was assisting in the civic and community projects to aid Nepalese people. Rajan and Shree along with the rest of their staff did everything possible to make my trip to Nepal my favorite one to date. I accomplished all I set out to do and more. In a country with more spirit and kindness than money or infrastructure this is a HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT! I would HIGHLY Recommend Earthbound Expeditions to ANYONE seeking to visit the beautiful country of Nepal, India, Bhutan, or any other area they service. Best Regards, Alex Kruz"

These guys went above and beyond, making sure we were safe and comfortable, during and after those grueling hours of trekking.

It was an amazing experience teaching the students in the mountains (highly recommended to all!!!). There is no hotels in his village so I stayed at Arjun's house (I lived like the locals!!). The Everest Trek was great but the experience of living like the locals was even more memorable. Without their assitance, it would not be possible to set up a students scholarship to support the students (some w/o parents) in the mountains. Thousand thanks to Arjun and Earthbound again for making my dreams come true!"

My friend and I joined the Earthbound Expeditions yoga and trekking tour on 23 November 2013, and could not have had a better time. The itinerary was fantastic, challenging enough for a novice like me - my legs definitely felt it! - but managing to take in many different facets of Nepali life. We saw the sun come up over the Himalayas from Poon Hill, witnessed many Nepalis going about their daily life and really getting an insight into how hard that really is, and seeing forests, rivers and waterfalls, as well as wild monkeys. I loved every minute of it.All the Earthbound Expeditions staff we encountered were fabulous. Our guide, Apar, was particularly good..... helpful, informative, quick witted and entertaining.... The porters were excellent.... Always cheerful and smiling, often singing, and happy to help with anything. Our group included a couple in their 70s - truly inspirational in itself - but when they did struggle on some parts, Apar and the porters were always right on hand, making sure they were ok. We were treated to dancing from the porters some evenings, which really was a highlight - the joy they exude is infectious and soon we were all on our feet. The yoga sessions we had as part of the trip were just what was needed in preparing us for the trek, and sorting out our aching muscles after. I would happily have done more - and the opportunity to do some on the trek itself would have been welcome, although I realise this would have been a logistical challenge to organise. If I were to pick a lowlight (not an easy task), it would have to be the cultural show they provide on the last evening. After several days experiencing real Nepali life on the trek, this was less than interesting, with average food, and little to commend it. As an aside to the organisers, this may have some merit on the first night of the trip, before we've had the opportunity to sample so much fabulous food, and warm hospitality on the trek. After the trek, it felt entirely manufactured. Our group still had a great evening as we took in some of the Kathmandu nightlife after the show. My advice would be if you are considering taking this awesome trip..... skip the show, and head straight for the nightlife!All in all, an exceptional holiday that will be remembered for a long, long time. Thanks Earthbound Expeditions...... hopefully we will trek together again one day!"

Trek itself was tough, but to be expected. It would be wise to train before hand. We had one person in the group that didn't finish for the sole fact that they were not physically prepared. You need to have a good amount of money in rupees for the trek as there are not many ATMs or money exchange places and commonly the ATMs were out of money. You can also pretty much expect to get sick in some sort of way, whether its a cold/chest infection, altitude or from food. Be prepared with medication for all of the above. Also beware of what you eat. Things such as baked beans are opened and used again only when ordered which means you have no idea how old they are. Milk, tomato soup etc is all powdered and again sometimes risky. I learned alot of this after the fact. When you get travel insurance make sure you get additional insurance for helicopter rescue. One person in our group needed helicopter rescue due to altitude sickness and ended up with a $4000 bill that was not covered by insurance. Chitwan was a good experience for me although some people did not feel it was worth it. The bus ride is 6 hours long and very bumpy. You are not guaranteed to see rhinos and other wild life. I was lucky to see 5 rhinos on elephant back and another one at sunset crossing the river although I know someone that went and didn't see even one. Tigers are very very rare. Me and a few others paid extra for a longer and deeper jeep safari and it didn't turn out to be worth it as we saw alot more in the morning during our elephant ride, but I guess thats the risk you take. All in all, a trip of a lifetime!!! Very recommended!"

Everything was set up, there was always a taxi waiting for us, and local to meet us at the next activity. We simply sat back, stopped stressing and enjoyed the trip. The best part was the poonhill trek. You MUST request Thakur and Narayan for your guide/porter team. They went above and beyond in all aspects. While staying at the tea houses with other Trekkers and sharing stories, we got the sense our experience was much more enjoyable. Their English skills are impressive as well. We really enjoyed learning about the culture from Nepalis rather than a western guide like some companies employ (and charge more for!)We were always happy, and felt safe. On a personal note, if I were to redo our trip, we would skip the Chitwan Safari(which isn't run by Earthbound anyway) and instead add more trekking days. A great experience!"

It is possible it was because I was travelling alone and slightly neglected even though I was charged a premium for the single supplement. Also spent alot of time waiting for other people. They were very quick with responding emails which was great but I think at some point he got me mixed up with someone else and I had to reconfirm my itinerary last minute. Let me just put out there I've roughed it plenty so I'm not too picky on where I sleep. I could tell I got a substandard room in Thamel on the first night because I could compare it to my last night when I got a much better room. On the first night the bathroom was separated from the toilet in the next via a wooden plank so I could hear everything going on (yes. all kinds of business). The guides I was provided with were EXCELLENT. I have no complaints there, at one point my mountain biking guide might have even saved my life from a head on truck. We did a short pleasant hike to Nargakot, accommodation there was pretty good the sunrise could be seen on the roof and even my room. The next day was \"downhill\" biking to Dhulikhel. It was NOT as advertised- easy downhill through a national park. The majority of it was on highways which I was not comfortable with at all, it was very dusty and people had a general lack of concern for cyclists. I felt like I spent those two days mostly trying to stay alive and avoid everything else and it was not enjoyable coming back into kathmandu city on a push bike. I wish this point was made more clear for people taking the option to mountain bike. Accommodation in Dhulikhel yet again was disappointing simply because I could compare it to all the other better available spots across the street for a lot less than what I paid for (guides/fees accounted). My room had a huge hole in the wall which was apparently used for trash disposal. No back up gen power out all night-thus no warm shower. Sleeping in my clothes covered in dirt from mountain biking was a better option to getting under the grubby looking sheets (covered in someone else's hair). If I was up in the mountains where accommodation was limited I would have no complaints but in a big city like Dhulikhel I feel like the company skimped out."

About 7 years ago I learned that one could actually hike to the Everest Base Camp, and in June of this year I finally booked the EBC trek with Earthbound Expeditions. Originally I chose them because this particular tour was being offered at a discount with Travelzoo, but the real reason I booked with them was the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. Organization leading up to the trip was via email with Tarek, who answered all of my questions promptly. Just don't expect to get too much more than brief answers out of him - I got the impression he was very busy and also found out later he is based in India, not Nepal. In short:*Unlike some other members of our group (12 of us in total) I had no issues with my airport pick up or hotel drop off. This went quite smoothly for me in spite of the fact that I didn't exit the airport until almost 1.5 hours after we landed*Accommodations were just fine thru out the tour. I paid for the single supplement (a slight rip off when you realize that rooms are only about $2 on the trekking portion) and it was worth it for me to have my own room everywhere we went. *Our guide, Prem Tamang, was wonderful. I was sad to say goodbye to him and wouldn't hesitate to hire and/or request him as my guide on my next trip to the mountains. He was friendly and polite but also took his job of keeping us alive and well very seriously. Plus he gave these awesome group speeches every night, and quite often he had everyone in the teahouse listening along with us lol We appreciated the information he gave, and the timing in which he gave it. (not too far ahead as altitude kind of makes you a bit stupid and he knew we wouldn't remember anything if he told us too early!) His assistant (Dambar)and our porters were also a great group of guysUnfortunately the beautiful weather we had for the first week of the hike suddenly turned on us at Dingboche, and we were unable to continue on to EBC. This was EXTREMELY disappointing to all of us, but it was fairly obvious that we would not be able to safely or logically continue due to the snow. Such a bummer.My only suggestion would be for Mr. Rajan to offer more guidelines in terms of appropriate and fair tipping for the guides and porters. His offhand \"base amount\" suggestion at our original group meeting was taken very literally by some members of our group, while some of us felt the amount suggested was unfairly low. This caused quite a bit of discussion and tension amongst some of us and was the only sour point of the trip for me. (other than having to turn around of course!)Can't say enough positive things about this experience....it was so much more than I imagined and I can't wait to go back for Round 2!"

It was simply breathtaking! At that point, I knew I wanted to be closer to those giants.We were fortunate to find the time to go back to Nepal for our second trek in the Khumbu region. Although Tengboche was our farthest point on the trek, we were still surrounded by 6,000m, 7,000m and 8,000m mountains! And thanks to Resham our Earthbound guide, and Bhim our porter, we were well looked after all the way.We were impressed by Earthbound's owner Rajan Simkhada and his dedication to his work. We communicated by email before we arrived in Nepal, and he was there to greet us when we arrived. He is very professional and well informed, and he is passionate about Nepal and giving back to the community. One thing also to note - Earthbound seems to be highly regarded by the teahouses, which would make a difference in securing accommodation during peak periods.We'll definitely visit Nepal again, most likely with Earthbound, as there is so much more there that we haven't seen and experienced."

I selected the 5 star package for Kathmandu (Hyatt), Pokhara(Temple Tree) and Chitwan(Jungle Safari Lodge). I am really happy with the package that I selected. The only room of improvement that I would like to suggest is if the accommodation in Chitwan can be higher level of standard for the 5 star package. Rajan was very accommodating in fulfilling our requests. The day hiking down Sarangkot was simply excellent. Well done Earthbound Expeditions."

While I am always travelling solo, I took a chance with a small group trekking adventure with Earthbound via Rajan Simkhada - Earthbound (simkhadar@yahoo.com). I had the most wonderful experience and met the most helpful staff (hotel and trek). The trek leader and the boys carrying our gear became family before the end of the trek. I was extremely impressed with the Thamel Eco Resort accommodations. Not only were they the most comfortable among the places I stayed during my 3 month S. Asian trip, but the price for the rooms were only what I could call inexpensive, if not cheaply priced, when they could have been double and I still would have been happy to pay. I will surely use Earthbound arrangements again not only for a return Nepal trip but also to visit Tibet and possibly northern India. Thank you Rajan and please say namaste to all the trek staff, including Ajay Dharal, the trek leader as well as Prakesh, food provider Sushel, the famous dancing machine Buddhi and, finally, the funny and easy-going Ramesh Tamang. See you all soon at the Thamel Eco Resort and at Earthbound!"

Included meals were authentic and delicious. Hotel staff were always gracious and smiling. The yogi was wonderful as well, teaching an emphasis more on mental awareness over physical fitness/toning of western course I'd done in Berkeley and SF...Which was unexpectedly useful for the long trek to come. All day trips around Kathmandu were guided by a very professional and knowledgeable college professor with a good sense of making sure things didn't feel too touristy. Owner Rajan was usually personally available to attend to needs and questions. At dinner one night we spoke to him in the hotel to upgrade our trek to a custom private Annapurna Base Camp, and by breakfast the next day he had it all set up complete with an AWESOME guide + porter. We will never forget our wonderful guide, Barat, and our porter Sandisk. We ended up spending two weeks trekking the Himalayas with these two men and they were personable, friendly, and knowledgeable, and never too chatty, imposing, or pushy. (We'd noted some other groups along the trek with guides/porters that were boorish, incompetent, or unprofessional). Our guys handled our supplies, lodging, food, communicated well, even bringing an impressive array of emergency articles...EVERYTHING 100% pro and totally inspired confidence. We didn't have to think about logistics at all, and utterly enjoyed every moment. There are some things in Nepal that I didn't like seeing so much, such as certain groups of tourists unfairly haggling poor merchants, the oppressive pollution and traffic in Kathmandu, and those darn rolling power outages. But due to Earthbound's ways, none that stuff negated any of a wonderful experience overall. Thank you Rajan, Barat, everyone on the Earthbound staff, and all the associated vendors. You guys are the best!"

Usually independent travelers and not fond of traveling with large groups, we decided to go with a tour company only a few days before leaving for Nepal at the recommendation of friends who had recently traveled there. Found Earthbound Expeditions on Trip Advisor and believe it made all the difference in the world. Rajan worked with us to develop and tailor a trip that met and then far exceeded our expectations. For the majority of the trip, it was the two of us and our guide, Nama. Rajan met us at the airport in Kathmandu, made sure we got to the domestic terminal with no issues and continued to check in with us during our trip to make sure everything was going as planned. Our guide, Nama, was tremendous. It was like traveling with a very knowledgable, old friend. He proactively took care of everything behind the scenes that I am sure would have otherwise led to great frustration. It appeared seamless, yet I know took a great deal of coordination and time to set up. We were just able to enjoy an incredible two day trek from Pokhara to Ghandruk and back, paragliding in Pokhara, trips to the World Peace Pagoda, the lake in Pokhara, and the best place to watch sunrise over the mountains. He was a wealth of knowledge about trekking, Nepal, local culture and customs, and really any other question we had. Once back in Kathmandu, Nama continued to guide us through the top sites in the city - Boudhanath stupa, Bhaktapur, Durbar Square, and the Pashputinath Temple. I hope to be able to return to Nepal some day and will most definitely plan that trip with Earthbound Expeditions."

Rajan and his team didn\u2019t disappoint - From the initial Airport pick up, welcome phone call and also welcome meeting, we knew that all our needs would be met.  Accommodation in Kathmandu and Pokhara was booked in advance for us and was of perfect standard. As was the pre-arranged flight to Pokhara which ran on schedule.  The Kathmandu sightseeing tour included in our itinerary was fantastic! \u2013 Visiting 4 different sights it was very educational. The guide was extremely informative and the day itself was breath-taking \u2013 I would highly recommend.  The trek itself was truly remarkable and we decided to take up accommodation at the teahouse lodges. Our guide and porter were very attentive going beyond their call of duty. Food was filling and tasty and we were always left with them us asking if we were satisfied. Gopal was our guide and a pleasure to spend time with. The porter too was very helpful and always cheerful.  Again, the trek was flexible in how much distance we wanted to cover and which villages we preferred to stay in. Gopal was great in finding the best rooms with a view and the best tea houses for comfort. The trip finished with a Nepalese evening and dinner with Rajan. It was a nice gesture and end to our trip. We will be back!"

From our first enquiry, Rajan at Earthbound Expeditions was nothing but helpful, responding to emails promptly and advising on an itinerary for us. From the minute we arrived in Nepal we were well taken care of \u2013 we were picked up then settled into the Thamel EcoResort, where all the staff were helpful and friendly and they put on a great breakfast buffet! We started off on the Poonhill Trek which was beautiful and our guide Gopal was brilliant, making sure we had the rooms with the best views, advising on the best eating and drinking options \u2013 all around attentive from start to finish. He was also incredibly caring always checking we were okay and even helping us down some of the steep and icy paths! As two women travelling alone, he made us feel very much at ease and we would not hesitate in recommending him to other women travellers.For the second part of our trip we had intended to go to the Everest region but unfortunately on the morning we were due to fly to Lukla we had to change our plans as my mum was experiencing some symptoms of altitude sickness from our first trek. Even though it was such short notice Rajan was able to change our flights to the following day to allow another rest day in Kathmandu and the chance to go to the doctors. In the end she was advised not to return to altitude, so Rajan cancelled the flight and rebooked us onto a Mountain Flight so we would still get the chance to see Everest. Rajan and Gopal then came up with a new trek for us to do in the Kathmandu Valley. Once again Gopal catered to our every need on this beautiful trek through traditional countryside with wonderful panoramic views of the mountains, and unlike the Annapurna trek we hardly encountered any other tourists which was great! We were so impressed with Earthbound Expeditions and the way nothing was ever too much trouble, Rajan completely rearranged our itinerary at short notice and for no extra cost \u2013 he even accompanied us to dinner on our final night! I cannot speak more highly of Rajan and the excellent way he treats his customers - please do not hesitate to book a trip with Earthbound Expeditions!"

A word about our porter Dhukpa, should also be said - like Maule he was exceptionally friendly, helpful and incredibly fit!The teahouses chosen were all comfortable and had excellent food (albeit mainly dhal baat, hehehe), and plenty of hot tea.When bad wheather struck, Maule tailored our trek accordingly (after discussing it with us of course) to ensure we remained safe.Our additions to the trip where also excellent. Rajan (the owner of Earthbound) was very friendly as well and ensured we were comfortable and well taken care of. The hotel (Thamel Eco-Lodge) in Kathmandu was very comfortable and clean. The Kathmandu city tour was very interesting and well organised with a private shuttle bus to get us around. Our trip to Pokhara and to Chitwan were also fantastic. (We got terrible food poising in Chitwan through no fault of the company but although we were sick it was great to see that everyone was concerned and offered as much assistance as possible until we were well again.)Earthbound expeditions is an exceptional company and made our dream of visiting Base Camp a reality in a well organised, comfortable, friendly and safe way.I would recommend them very highly and in fact are already thinking about planning our next trip to Nepal with them."

The scenery was amazing. Breath taking in fact. The meals and lodging were great for what was on offer. Never went hungry or without a comfortable bed and was always felt very welcome. In fact being vegan the earthbound staff would always make sure my meals were suited to my requirements. I often have trouble getting that type of service at home. Brilliant!The best memory I will take away from this trip is of the staff. Our guide Gopal is without a doubt the most peaceful, caring, respecting man I have ever met. His knowledge and passion for these wonderful mountains was a joy to witness and I will think of him whenever I think of my amazing trip to this wonderful country. I hope to see you again Gopal.Oh, and a big shout out to Debendra, who was always there when the legs got tired and the going got tough.This company comes highly recommended and rightly so.Cheers."

            "review": "Good choice. I spent approximately three weeks sending e-mail to different companies to decide which one to choose. They are pretty similar when you receive the e-mails although the prices are quite different. Earthbound came with a good price and I like the communication with Rajan. The e-mails were nicely detailed and he was open to discuss new ideas.The first day I arrive in Kathmandu there was someone waiting me at the airport, the person took me to the Hotel, which I chose before, and in the next morning there was a really nice guide who take me to a tour around Kathmandu. I went then to the Agency and after a long talk to Rajan I changed my plan and instead of going to Langtang region I went to Pokhara heading to Mustang area. I paid for a Guide and a Porter and one day before he told me I would have a porter guide which I did not like. I'd rather believe it was a mistake since as soon I told him I paid for both separately he said there was no problem.One of the things I believe differ from one Agency to another is the choice of the \"hotels\" you will stay during you trekking. I believe some agencies safe money at this point. I have no complains about the hotels I stayed during my trekking except one that was quite dirty. Anyway you should not expect to do a trail with fancy hotels. Most of them have no hot water and are basic but good.The guide and the porter were nice people and really helpful. The guide told me to not eat meat during the trip. Later on I found out they say sometimes to not eat meat to safe money as they receive a fix amount from the Agency and whatever they save stay with them. Anyway I agreed with the idea of not having meat as I might not be used to it. I told my guide to suggest something every day.When I came back from Mustang there was no flight available due to bad weather. We came back by bus, truck and the guide made the difference. We had a big group and if my guide was not there I believe we would not have arrived back in Pokhara on the same day. All the guides were following my guide.The price was reasonably good however a friend of mine asked the price recently to Earthbound and unfortunately it was not not cheap. Overall I would recommend Earthbound."

We had many pleasant conversations along the trek with them, and other trekkers, and were quite sad that we did such a short trek! As hard as it was for us, the encouragement of our guide and porters and patience was very nice to see. We wished we did a longer trek for we truly had much fun!Rajan gives his clients really good personal attention, and met us for dinner - the Nepali cultural show. Its really nice to meet with such a motivated and ambitious person who is truly making a difference in the industry. I believe he has one of the most comprehensive programmes and there are loads of activities you can choose to do with Earth bound - there is even a charity trek.Truly enjoyed it, and I could not had asked for more.

However, there was no reason to be nervous as a representative from Earthbound was standing right at the door with a sign to pick us up and bring us to the hotel. We stayed at the Eco Lodge in Kathmandu which is also owned by Rajan. It is a very nice hotel with a good breakfast. I recommend to try and get a room in one of the higher floors as they are much nicer. The staff was very friendly and we felt comfortable and safe the entire time. Everything about our trek was organized perfectly and went off without a hitch. Our guide Hari was fantastic! The Tea Houses were quite comfortable and the food was good. Neither my husband or I felt sick from the food at any point during our trek. We did our trek during high season and it was quite busy. However we never had to worry about getting a room as Hari always made sure to book the rooms in advance and to send our porter ahead of us as a double check. This was not the case in other agencies as we witnessed some people arriving at the tea houses only to find out that even though they had a \"reservation\" the room had been given to someone else. Rajan's attention to detail and passion for his job are very apparent and we are so glad we went with Earthbound.

Choosing Earthbound Expeditions was one of the best decisions we made about our trip for several reasons. It is a local company run by its president Rajan Simkhada, who wants people to see Nepal as he does. Compared to large trekking groups, we had exceptional value. We were led by Apar Datta Pant, Guide and Gopal Neupane, Porter were two of the most exceptional, experienced and English speaking Nepalis we met on the Annapurna trek. Also, Apar was always in the teahouse kitchen watching food preparation so neither of us were sick with the \"tourista.\" Huge plus! Since there were only two of us on the trek our guide was able to make a few modifications which really enhanced the trek. One of the best changes were to trekked out via a another route. A real plus during the busy trekking season. Least favorite part of the trek for me was the body-to-body head lamp hike before sunrise. But suffice to say as the tourism slogan goes \"Naturally Nepal once is not enough\" and I'd do it again and again with Earthbound Expeditions."

But discover the magnificent waterfalls and majestic mountains, too. Special? We savored a 4-hour jungle safari atop an elephant (and then bathed the elephants!), tracked and found a wild rhino, loved several boat rides, walked the steps of the Dalai Lama's Palaces, and had immense fun bargaining at every market imaginable. I could write a book. The scenery was drop-dead gorgeous, and flying over Mount Everest was unforgettable. Our guide, Hari, in Nepal and our driver Deepok were frosting to the best cake I have ever eaten. We wanted to bring them back to the States with us. Please visit Tibet NOW. The culture is fast changing, so see it while the alleyways still remind you of the old country. I waited until my 60's to see these magnificent countries, and it was worth the wait, understatement.

Traveling to Nepal for the first time and making it back safe (and a better person) \u2013 I will have to say that I definitely made the right choice to travel with Earthbound Expeditions as my guide and agent.For the first time travelers: the best way to start your adventure is to hire someone who can navigate the labyrinth of options for you. From finding and booking hotels to arranging (and changing) airline and bus tickets. Traveling in Nepal is not like any place else (that I have experienced). You will have to be patient and flexible. Having someone to take care of the formalities for you makes things much easier and can save you a lot of stress and time. If you are worried about being on a \u201ctour\u201d and being stuck with a schedule \u2013 don\u2019t be. I have changed my mind about bus travel after my first trip from Kathmandu to Pokhara. Rajan got me on a flight \u2013 no problem. Last minute. I didn\u2019t particularly like the hotel in Pokhara so I found a better one \u2013 I then called Rajan \u2013 he changed the hotel for me. No problem.As I got more comfortable in Nepal and still had time to spear I decided to add trekking to my repertoire. As usual \u2013 no problem. He even provided the guide I felt comfortable trekking with and some small things that I needed for the trek (since I was completely unprepared). I canceled (last minute) my trip to Tibet due to problem with my permit (I had to travel to Shanghai after Tibet and I didn\u2019t have time to get a new Chinese visa) \u2013 no problem.It is not an easy task to manage people\u2019s expectations while using very limited resources. Earthbound Expeditions and Rajan did absolutely amazing job. You will have to change your realities and standards \u2013 things are not the same in the mountains. But after a month I have to say that I had an incredible journey and memories to last me a life time.I will definitely return to Nepal soon. And even now though being able to manage the trip by myself - I would definitely chose to work with Earthbound Expeditions."

Rajan Simkhada organized it very well and our experienced guide, Thakur Sapkota, and the porter, Susil, were excellent. They treat us easily like family, always watching to see what we needed and providing us with the best rooms in the teahouses. The landscape was very impressive, specially the night we spent at the ABC when at 4:30am we were waken up by Thakur to see all the peaks, lit entirely by moonlight. We won\u00b4t forget that image.We strongly recommend this experience."

Mygma, our guide, was a very experienced and customer oriented person, he spoke english very well and he was always open to do some changes to our itinerary.

Rajan the owner of the company went out of his way to answer all our voluminous questions before our departure. His gracious answers were always quick and to the point with no nonsense. This gave us great confidence in his company and we decided to select Earthbound Expeditions with my friend. We did right, as our trek in the Annapurna Sanctuary was just magnificent, well organized, and so amazing. The staff went out of their way to make this trek one of the most memorable journey of our life. We were pampered and always felt safe during all our stay even when crossing some difficult paths on our way to the Annapurna Base camp. We had a lot of fun, laughter and discovered amazing sceneries with both our outstanding guide Nabin (who speaks French and English) and our outstanding porter Krishna, an incredible human being. Thanks to the support of our two great friends and the Earthbound company, this was more than a trek. It was also a lesson in selflessness, inner peace, and compassion in the midst of landscape of extraordinary beauty.We have done many trips around the world but we will rate our journey in Nepal without hesitation an outstanding experience.On the practical side we loved our hotel: the Kantipur Temple house: a three star hotel exquisitely decorated in Nepalese style and with a friendly staff. Good food, calm and very well situated near Thamel where you can do incredible shopping. Ask for the deluxe room good value for your money. Free wifi in the lobby.In Pokara the Bahari hotel situated near the lake and restaurants is nice with great views on the snowy mountain. Ask for Deluxe room with balcony upper floor. Good value for money.The tea house picked up for us by our guide Nabin along the trek were all very clean with great views on the mountain. Be ware that at high altitude you need an adequate down comforter (0 to minus 20 degrees Celsius), the company graciously will provide you with an adequate one. The tea house have no heating in the rooms. I strongly recommend the national vegetarian dish the Dhal which is excellent in protein, you can also ask for pizzas. Bring with you a camel bag for your water. In the last stretches toward the Annapurna base camp mineral water is not provided bring pills to purify the water. We had no problem with food poisoning during our entire journey.We recommend spring as the rhododendrons are in full bloom. Also do not hesitate to take a few days to visit Katmandu with the help of Earthbound Expeditions you will not regret it."

He was very patient and able to accommodate to my requests in order to tailor a special trip for us. We went back and forth on email several times until I was happy with the itinerary.We had a wonderful experience, and everything went as planned. Some of the hotels were better than others, but in some of the places we visited, there very few lodging options, so you have to be a little flexible and understand that some of the hotel standards will be different from back home. I reviewed the hotels in which we stayed, so you can check my other reviews for more information. For the most part, our guides and drivers were excellent who went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.Overall, I highly recommend Mr. Rajan and Earthbound Expeditions.

Nothing was too much trouble for the three of them and they helped ensure we had an unforgettable trek up to Everest Base Camp. In Kathmandu Rajan ensured we were looked after by suggesting other sights we might be interested in, and, of course, dinner on the last night with him and our other companion was a great way to end our time in Nepal.

Rajan kept us updated on the travel situation constantly and reassured us that they will do whatever is necessary to keep our cancellation costs low. Even though we did not make it for that trip - Rajan made good on his promise to hold on to our deposit to use for our trip the following year - very commendable for his honesty.During our trip, we made a last minute decision to go to Bhutan since we had additional time at hand. In spite of the very short notice, the visa and all trip arrangements were made very promptly for us. It is very apparent that Rajan is very highly experienced as a ex-guide and trip planner, so everything went smoothly for us in spite of a complicated and intense itinerary involving Tibet-EBC-Bhutan-Nepal. The guides we had were professional and took care of us. We enjoyed our trip immensely and would highly recommend Rajan and Earthbound Expeditions to anyone!"

My husband and I spent 1 month in Nepal. Prior to our trip, Rajan (the owner of Earthbound) personally answered every question we had and helped us customize a trip to exactly what we wanted to experience. We chose Earthbound Expeditions based on the wonderful reviews, but we were still amazed at how personalized the service was. Rajan was completely flexible in tailoring a trip for us. We're seasoned travelers and had never used a tour company before so we were a bit afraid it would limit us (the serendipity of travel is often the best part). On the contrary, Rajan deftly reacted to every change we made along the trip. We don't even know how he would do it, but magically there would be taxis/bus tickets/plane tickets waiting for us or people to help us every step of the way. Place your trust in Rajan and you can't go wrong. He is also incredibly loyal to his country, knowledgeable, kind, and helps build schools in local villages.We started our trip by trekking the Annapurna Circuit. Much to our surprise (and happiness) were weren't placed in a group of 10+, it was just my husband and myself. Our guide Sudip and our porter Gokel went above and beyond to make the experience outstanding. Sudip spoke excellent English and would willingly answer the thousands of questions we asked about Nepali culture. He was knowledgeable and helpful, but more important he was friendly, kind and so easy to be around. There is a risk in choosing to spend most of your vacation alongside perfect strangers, but we couldn't have asked for a better experience than with Sudip and Gokel. Gokel also spoke English and was helpful far beyond his porter duties...including being the best of us at spotting monkeys on the hillside and even cooking us a delicious lunch himself when the tea house was crowded. Sudip and Gokel always made sure we were taken care, both on the trail and at the tea houses. I had some issues w/ altitude sickness going over the pass; Sudip was completely reassuring and when I was at my worst and scared, he somehow released the pressure in my head through massage to help me make it over. Gokel also went the extra mile as well by even taking my Day Pack. It was on that day that I couldn't have imagined not having them alongside. I've backpacked all of my life, but being at that high of an elevation is unlike anything I've ever experienced...having an experienced guide and porter to pace us, monitor, and reassure us when we were sick made all of the difference in our confidence. Even for little things like colds and food poisoning, they always had either medication or traditional remedies (like garlic soup) to help us.We planned to end our trek in Jonsom, but when our flight was canceled due to weather we decided to change plans and finish trekking the circuit on our own. Within minutes, Sudip stopped a local bus passing by, plopped us in a seat and asked a guide he knew on the bus to help us if needed. Sudip even dropped our extra bag in Pokhara (our destination) and arranged for a taxi to be waiting for us 5 days later to take us there. Mid-trip, we even called him to confirm and mostly because by then we missed our friends Sudip and Gokel!All of the lodging selected by Earthbound Expeditions was great. On the trail, they always procurred the rooms with the BEST views for us. Whether we were coming off of the trail or on our way to Chitwan, they were always a step ahead of us arranging transportation and lodging.The value of hiring Earthbound Expeditions for our Nepal trip far outweighed the actual costs involved. The charges are very, very reasonable and the service absolutely exceeded our expectations!"

This message is for those who are interested to join Kailash - Lhasa tour, Traveling with Earthbound Expeditions in (western) Tibet is traveling with a feeling of safety. Especially in that part of the world where they do not have all those safety services we western people are so common with. Earthbound Expedition is very keen on prevention for the food, drinking water, cars and also for the altitude sickness. Yes, it hit me and it hit everyone who is not used to travel on such altitude. But slowly I, and the others are used to it. They never forced a situation for the sake of their own. Speaking for my own. I could make it without taking drugs like Diamox. That brought me the feeling having a very relaxed time in this remote part of the world. Traveling western Tibet and climbing Mount Kailash ( Dolma - La) was a kind of adventure that makes me feel good because they saw it as their duty to guard us without overreacting. And although we were with a group of fourteen, which meant so many different people with all their different wishes, nevertheless everyone off us was satisfied about the quality of life. One thing you should know ! They know very interesting places even the well-known travel guides do not describe.

Without hesitation, Ajay went down the hill to retrieve it, without a complaint! Our porters and us continued on and Ajay caught up with us within 20 minutes, with perspiration and a smile on his face.At Birenthanti, our last stop before heading back to Pokhara, Ajay noticed that we did not enjoy our dinner of Mashed Potatoes.

This is my second time in Nepal and my second time using Rajan and Earthbound. Nepal is an amazing place to go so Rajan's product is quite easy to sell, however it's so easy to become stuck with a bad company and a bad guide - there are 1500 or more companies in Kathmandu, not to mention all the overpriced companies organising trips from Europe and the US, not knowing anything about the guide you will be assigned. Rajan thankfully gets it all right. And at the right price (if the price seems low it's because that's how much things cost in Nepal, the service is still 5*). He's professional, friendly and always responds to your queries no matter how many times you ask the same thing. The guide he sent with us knew everything about the entire region - believe me some guides can't even point out Everest - and was very professional. We also had the best porter on the entire base camp trail. As we were in Nepal during Diwali Rajan invited us to his house for the final day of the festival - Tihar - to experience and celebrate this with his family. Additionally, my boyfriend and i volunteered in an orphanage in Kathmandu, also arranged through Rajan, which in many ways was the best part of our entire Nepal experience.

The two of us were the only one on the trip, which was great, compared to many of the larger groups that we saw. We had a phenomenal time and I would recommend Earthbound wholeheartedly! They do a great job in arranging everything, so there were no communication / arrangement problems.Earthbound staff (guide/porters): Our guide and porter were great! They were knowledgeable and very friendly and we felt completely at home with them. Our porter was especially awesome, though he didn't speak English, he was just a stand up, genuine fellow.Overall, we had a great time and wouldn't change anything about our trip, I was hesitant at first to go through an organized agency, but I quickly changed my mind."

Nepal never runs on time and is one of the most unreliable countries I've been to but the same could never be said about Rajan. From the moment you first email him until the time to say goodbye at the end of the holiday you feel that he is there just for you. It doesn't matter how many clients he has and how many flights are delayed, bags are missing or passports are lost, he can cope with everything.As I said in my first posting, you could do Nepal on your own and rely on planning everything locally but it will never go as you plan. You need someone to step in and rearrange when airports are shut down from fog or roads are cut off from landslides. Rajan is your man! His company will tailor any trip just for you and his prices are incredibly reasonable. Even more so when you see Rajan in action when things go arrray (which they probably will).I love Nepal and I was very, very sad to leave it again. The people are just fantastic. I will be back and I will be booking with Rajan again."

My father and I (68 and 38 respectively) just returned from a TRIP OF A LIFETIME trekking the Annapurna Circuit trek in Nepal, with Earthbound Expeditions. Back in April, we read an article in the NYT regarding this trek and the reporter mentioned two trekking companies. My dad sent emails to both organizations and was amazed to receive a thorough response with customized itinerary and pricing within the next day. That was our first excellent experience with Earthbound that continued on up to, during and at the end of our trip.Having trekked throughout the world, I must say that Earthbound Expeditions, the owner Rajan, our AMAZING guide Hari and porter Chhirring, are some of the most service-oriented, professional, caring and wonderful people we've ever worked with. Rajan answered my numerous emails in a timely manner and met with us personally at the beginning and end of our trek, for a wonderful NEpali dinner and culture show.In Nepal, anything can go and there are many unexpected events that can change your trip such as outrageous traffic jams, illnesses, altitude sickness, homesickness etc. Rajan and his guide were UNBELIEVABLE in their ability to go with the flow and change our itineary and WORK MAGIC on the trip. I could not believe it! We would never receive this kind of customer service and individualized attention in the US! Our guide, Hari was unbelievable. He and our porter bent over backwards to ensure we were happy, had lots of laughs, comfortable and even helped me make my daily calls home to my family! They became instant friends who I plan to keep in touch with. I would highly recommend EARTHBOUND to anyone interested trekking in Nepal, especially ones who want a unique experience and not to be with the herds (those huge, annoying trekkiing companies with 15-20 people per group...no thanks). I felt like being with the people from earthbound was almost more important even than the trek....I learned so much about the culture and life of Nepal and its people. It was an amazing experience and one I hope to someday do again. THANKS EARTHBOUND for your wonderful trip!!!!!"

            "review": "Earthbound Expeditions - Beyond Expectations. What a magical experience! This August my family and I enjoyed the trip of a lifetime in Nepal and Tibet. We are in our 40's and 50's and have two boys ages 5 and 12. Since we had just under two weeks for our trip we had a lot of things we wanted to do in a short time. We used Earthbound Expeditions of Katmandu for every detail of our trip. We flew into Katmandu, spent a night in Nagarkot and the Club Himalaya, drove to Pokara for a few days - stayed at the Fishtail Lodge, drove to Chitwan - stayed at the Rhino Residency, drove back to Katmandu - stayed at Darwicka's, flew to Lhasa - stayed at the Four Points Sheraton, worked our way overland back to Katmandu via Everest Base Camp, and then Darwicka's in Katmandu again before flying out. All along the way we had private guides, a Landcruiser, and driver.I really can't even begin to describe how utterly amazing this trip was. We were in the car for a very long time but I wouldn't have traded it for the world. The road trip let us see so much beauty and get such a feeling from being immersed in the both countries. Every corner we rounded brought another amazing sight into our view. Wow. It was simply breathtaking. Additionally having our own car allowed us to stop and check out whatever caught our interest. Like in Nepal the kids wanted to go out onto one of the wire suspension bridges that span the rushing rivers that crash through mountain canyons...so we did. HIghlights of Nepal include seeing all sorts of wildlife including several rhinos, up close and personal. Rhino Residency and in particular Mr. Chok our Chitwan naturalist were spectaular. If you go to Chitwan and you are interested in the people and wildlife of the area, you must go out into the jungle with Mr. Chok. He is like the \"Steve Irwin of Chitwan\". Highlights of Tibet were the breathtaking scenery and the off road trip from Everest Base Camp to Tingri and stopping to have tea with an ancient looking monk who invited us into his tent on a lonely mountain pass. The Tibetan driver and guide had friends all along the way.In regards to taking young children on this trip, I would say it is not for everyone but for our kids it was wonderful. They had so much fun and everywhere we went they found other kids to play with and got lots of attention for the local people who were not used to seeing young American kids. I believe that this trip and our other travels have made them very accepting to all of the diversity in our world and very comfortable with it. Whether they were receiving a blessing from a Hindu holy man, lighting a yak butter candle in a Buddist temple, or playing with the local Taru children in Chitwan .....they took it all in stride. I found myself yelling after the little one in Chitwan \"Hey slow down and stay away from the water buffalo's\". That is something I never would have said back in Ohio ;) The altitude in Tibet has to be respected especially with kids. The most important thing is to know the signs of altitude sickness and go lower if you have problems. Since we were traveling a little faster than I would have liked we took diamox which I think helped a great deal. My little one started to feel sick after a couple hours at Everest Base Camp so we headed back down instead of staying overnight in the tents like we had planned. As soon as we descended to a lower altitude he was fine. I made everyone drink only bottled water, no ice, or boiled drinks and nobody got sick even a little bit. The food was great in both countires. By the way, all of the reviews speak negatively about the tents at EBC but I found the one we were going to stay in to be very cozy and we had some yummy noodles and coffee there.I really can't say enough about Earthbound and the owner Rajan. I think we exchanged about 100 emails trying to sort out the details of our trip. He patiently worked with me and made change after change to our itinerary until we finally settled on the perfect package for our family. He was honest. Completely trustworthy. And best of all treated us like respected friends during the entire process. I have to admit that as a suburban American Mom I was a little cautious about heading out into exotic Nepal and Tibet with my kids. Working with Rajan was like having an old friend or a family member there for us. He met us at the airport, dropped us back off at the airport, was available via cell phone at all times during the trip. I am amazed at how he handled every detail. He took care of us at every step. For example, I was particularly concerned about the border crossing between Tibet and Katmandu because our guide from Tibet couldn't go with us across the border. However there were two guides waiting for us and introduced themselves as soon as we stepped out of our Landcruiser. They walked us through customs, over the border, through Nepal's immigration, and to our waiting Landcruiser on the Nepal side. It was seamless. Our guides and drivers were fabulous and wonderful company on our vacation. I can imagine that they are treated very well by Rajan and that promotes their great attitudes and service levels.So if you are thinking about visiting Nepal and Tibet I would say go and enjoy. It is a once in a lifetime magical experience."

Everything was perfectly organized yet flexible enough to mold to our schedule. The trek itself was outstanding, but our wonderful guides and porters enriched the experience tenfold. Rajan, the owner of Earthbound, was extremely patient in responding to our (probably excessive) emails beforehand, and extremely accommodating once we arrived. On my second to last night, I left my camera in a hotel room. After making several calls to track down the camera, Rajan had it sent overnight to Kathmandu so I was able to get it back home. I was extremely grateful for this extra aid."

We have been travelling the globe together for over 40 years and have never received such extraordinary expertise, service, and value as we did with Earthbound Expeditions. The Earthbound itinerary to Base Camp/Kala Patar is exceptional and our guide \u2013 Sudip \u2013 was extremely knowledgeable pacing us perfectly to ensure our success. What really separates a good company from an excellent company is how a crisis is handled. Inclement weather shut down the Lukla airport for several days and hundreds of trekkers, including us, were forced to wait in Kathmandu for a break in the clouds. Rajan, Earthbound\u2019s president, however, took charge and since helicopters were able to still make the flight to Lukla on one of the days with a break in the clouds \u2013 we were on one of only 13 choppers that made the flight. Not only were we now days ahead on the trek of our stranded fellow trekkers, Rajan also ensured that we had a full chopper both directions to minimize our extra cost! Also nice Earthbound touches include the use of excellent down sleeping bags and jackets for the trek minimizing our airline luggage check-ins; a wonderful celebration Nepali dinner with Rajan in Kathmandu; a great city tour; and, yes, even cool T-shirts! Earthbound is eco-friendly and supports numerous charities in Nepal. It is simply an exceptional organization and , of course, we plan on using Rajan and his team for future treks in Nepal, Tibet, and Bhutan."

Hary go on the EBC more than 20 times and the Annapurna circuit more than 40 times - he his a pro! very kind and the most modest person, you will not here a ward about money. Hary took care of us on the trek make sure that we will be happy he is an amazing guy, let me just say it like this: if you go to Nepal - go with Earthbound Expeditions, and do yourself a favor, ask rajan to assign you Hary nepal as porter/guide! It was Hary, just as the view and scenery, that made it a once in a lifetime journey for us."

Rajan is very good in hearing what you want - even if you don\u2019t know it exactly yourself yet- and can present you different customized options. He is straightforward in explaining both the highlights and potential downsides one might expect during a trek or trip; as well as what is possible and what\u2019s not. He takes customer care to the core of his business, never being bothered to call you during and/or after a trek to check if everything goes well.Besides his good humor and his dynamism, you can bet Rajan is very reliable. I never had any problem and will surely turn to him for next treks and trips.In addition, I also like his personal dedication to the development of Nepal. He is currently developing a trek that will pass his home village, far remote in the mountains, and where he personally is setting up a school. The income that he generates from this trek is set aside for the school. A great initiative!"

It was exactly what I was looking for, a low-key, very 'real' sort of feeling traveling by local bus and jeep, heading deep into the mountains and far far away from developed civilization. I was introduced to many friends and family and couldn't even believe that a place like this exists, where you can still find people living in such a pure and natural way. This first visit actually occurred last summer, and I have spent the last year fundraising and working to create an NGO. Now this summer, I returned to with a pocket full of donated money to help build the people living in this village a new primary school for their younger children. Over the span of four months I made 7 or so trips to and from the village and never tired of the experience. This is offered to everyone though its sort of like a secret item on the menu, just ask for the homestyle village trek. I highly reccomend it, it was life-changing for me. It is perfect for those looking to get off of the overcrowded tourist treks like EBC and Annapurna and get some insight into how Nepal might have existed before tourism became such an industry. The people living in these areas are so wonderful, all I can say is try it out if you have the opportunity. Rajan and his guides are the most helpful, respectful, and charming people in the business. Without his connections and professionalism nothing that I had hoped to accomplish in Nepal would have came close to fruition.

I received every thing promised and was very happy with my accomodations that were better than expected from books and informations I have read. The food was great and my guide was excellent and was there for me always, especially when I got sick. When I came back I felt like leaving a son in Nepal. I will be back."

            "review": "Wonderful Nepal trekking and Tibet tour with Earthbound Expeditions. We just got home from a fantastic trip through Nepal and Tibet. Rajan from Earthbound Expeditions arranged our trekking to Everest Base Camp and our Tibet jeep-tour wonderfully. EBC: We booked a trip with just the two of us, a private guide and a porter. Our guide Ram was really great. It's just this guy that you need during such a high altitude trek. We were quite unexperienced with high altitudes, but we felt really safe with him. Ram talks english very well, and just knew what to do when we suffered from the high altitudes; brought the right medication, and let us eat garlic and drink heaps of water. Furthermore, he knew the mountains very well. He is also volunteering often in medical camps and thus he's not only caring about his clients, but he cares about all the people in the mountains. Unfortunately we found out that not every guide in the EBC region cares about his clients. Ram had to take care of a girl that had problems with the altitude. Her guide was drinking beers somewhere else...Tibet jeep tour:We flew in on Lhasa, stayed there for two days, and drove back with jeeps to Kathmandu over the Friendship Highway. The whole Tibet-trip took us one week. Our Tibetan guide talked english very well, although he could not answer all our questions. But that was because of the difficult political situation in Tibet at the moment... Views during this jeep-trip were great, but you don't really need jeeps. The highway is just renewed and a normal bus would do the job as well. Hotels were fine, only in Tingri the rooms were very dirty. Luckily Rajan already told us, so we knew what we could expect.Everything was included in the trip, also all entrance fees. We heard from other travelers, who booked their jeep-trip somewhere else, they had to pay all entrance fees themselves. Rajan is always very explicit and he tells you exactly what is included and excluded in the trip, and what further expenses you can expect.Rajan responds on emails and requests very quick. He is very flexible and tries to make your holidays as convenient as possible. When you book a trip with him, you just know that everything is arranged well."

I found Rajan and his company completely by accident- a week before our holidays I still had no idea where to go so I searched Google for ideas. I wrote to Rajan and several others about possible last minute tours and an hour later Rajan had one sorted! Took 6 days to hear back from the only other person to reply.I have no idea how many other tours Rajan had on the go at the same time but I never felt like there was anyone else. All his attention seemed to focus on us. Even his drivers complain that he never stops calling them asking how things are going!! (Sorry Rajan- but it's true).Nothing ever goes to plan in Nepal- I understood that immediately. But Rajan can sort any problem out for you. Plans can be changed without you having to do anything- it will be Rajan and his mobile phone.I fully recommend Earthbound Expeditions to anyone interested in a trip to Nepal (or Bhutan, India or Tibet). Rajan takes care of everything for you (except traffic jams and weather) and leaves you to enjoy the experience. Adding, changing and tailoring the trip to your own needs is no problem at all for his company.Despite not seeing a single mountain during my stay (!!!!), I had a fantastic time and I am most definitely returning again. And again."

I learn of the above tag line used to promote nepal tourism i.e: once is not enough.....Indeed, how right they were !I was over in India for work early March 2010 and decided (very last minute) to take the opportunity to travel to Nepal. Having looked at tripadvisor review, not difficult to tell that there are many trekking companies available in Nepal, and that Earth Bound Expedition (EE) has consistently remained as the top ranking company. I decided to write to EE as i wanted to have a peace of mind knowing that i have a reliable company making all the necessary arrangement and all i need to do is show up and be prepared to trek for 12 days ! From the time the first email was send to EE, i got all my enquiries answered almost immediately, and there i was in Nepal doing Annapurna Circuit Trek, something which i have talked about for many years.....As i was travelling alone, EE arranged for a guide/porter whom took care of all the arrangement throughout the trek. Thoroughly enjoyed my trek and the view of Annapurna Region is stunning.....As i write this small little review, i hv already been back in touch with Rajan for an itenery of an overland trip from Kathmandu to Lhasa which i hope i could pull together sometime Sep/Oct this year itself with a few friends whom were obviously envious of my Annapurna trip and hence asked if i could arrange for another trip back to Nepal !"

On the trekking itself, our guide (Gopal) and porter (Rek) were absolute the best. Gopal is a nice and very experienced guide who did the track many times. Because of that, he knew the best places to sleep and eat. Due to rain, a lot of people had trouble finding a place to sleep but our guide managed to find a room every time. Both were very helpful, flexible and friendly. We felt sad when we had to say goodbye to them and are sure that next time we are in Nepal we will contact Earthbound for another trekking."

Rajan arranged flights for us to Pokhara and Jomsom, as well as a private car and driver for the return to Kathmandu. We were accompanied on our trek by an excellent Earthbound Expeditions guide/porter who helped us arrange food and lodging during the hike. When it came time for us to leave Kathmandu, Rajan also booked us a flight to Bangkok at the last minute which was cheaper than anything we found ourselves on the Internet.

We had a great experiance on this trek, its quite tough but also rewarding to see the big peaks on the way to and in the sanctuary itself, nothing quite compares to what you see when you get into the sanctuary, you really will not have seen anything like it before.Rajan from Earthbound did everything possible to ensure our trip was smooth, well organised and easy for us Brits who found ourselves in a strange land and initially the madness of Kathmandu. All his organisation and very warm welcome takes away some of the culture shock and makes you feel safe and in good hands right from the airport arrival pick up to the drop off (sadly) on the last day when you just won't want to leave Nepal.We were due to start our trek on Mon 6th April from Nayapul by taking a taxi 2hrs ride from Pokhara, unfortunately as it was nearly a year since the government took over the country decided to take an unofficial holiday so there was no transport. Rajan was on the case immediately and called our guide to discuss options with us, by 8am we had a new plan and we were off! it involved a bit if extra trekking but it got us onto the trail and started so we could remain on schedule. The change in plan meant we now how to do our trek backwards but our fantastic guide Gamboo was very careful to plan in a good aclimitization strategy which paid dividends as none of us suffered any altitude sickness symptoms at all so on our 'summit' day to ABC we all felt great. That day will stay with me for the rest of my life, we left in the dark just before 5am and walked up in the snow into the dawn as the sun began to flash its rays upon the sanctuary, an unforgetable moment.Our guide and porters were first class, they looked after us the whole way, at meal times, getting us good rooms etc. a total service. Our guide was very experianced and every time we asked 'how long to ..... ' he was spot on every time so we knew we could rely on everything he said. He also know's all the mountains, will point them out and tell you a bit about them. They also appreicate some mustang coffee (not sure i recommend it but give it a try!) over a few card games in the evening.As, when, if (I really hope so) I return to Nepal I would go straight to Rajan's company to make all my arrangements as I know from this experiance that he's totally reliable, does everything he can to ensure you have a great time in Nepal, is passonate about tourisum, and his price is very competitive - you get excellent value for money.If mountains, the outdoors and trekking is your thing (or even if its not) I recommend Nepal for a great experiance and you won't go wrong with Rajan and Earthbound."

Indeed, we were referred to Rajan by our friends who had good experiences with them. The decision to use Rajan and his team was such a blessing to us and we were so glad we did. To be specific, Rajan first impressed us with his prompt responses to our emails enquiries before the trip.There were many changes in our planning as it was our first trip to Nepal but Rajan was so patient to guide us through the planning and eventually we decided to take a 6 days leisure tour around Kathmandu and Pokhara.However, upon our arrival to Kathmandu, we were so thrilled by the mountains ranges seen from the plane, that we decided at the last minute to change (again) our itinery to do a trekking holiday instead.Rajan was so kind and so accommodating to us, making sure that we get to have the best experiences in Nepal, that he helped us to change and plan our trekking expedition. That means he has to book the air tickets and land transports and make accommodation arrangements on the mountains at the eleventh hour for us.We truly appreciate this gracious gesture from Rajan as he keeps his clients' interest at heart and go an extra mile for them to make sure that their clients get the best experiences in Nepal. We were just 2 ladies and we trekked the Ghorepani/Poonhill trek. We had a fantastic guide, his name is Shree, who speaks good english and a very experienced and knowledgeable trekking guide. During our trek, he showed us the Nepalese culture, the people and the way the Nepalese live their lives more than a guide book can offer you. He is very warm and attentive to us. We strongly recommend you to use him as your guide in your forthcoming trip. The porter we used, his name is Sunil, who is also very good and very thoughtful. We would also recommend you to use Sunil as your porter too. From the land transports, the hotels on earth and lodges on the mountains to the hospitality extended to us by the Nepalese during our trip, were simply first class quality services we could not ask for more. There were no hiccups, no hidden cost, Rajan's team was all honest, sincere and reliable. Most importantly, we felt that we were so well taken care of by them that we have decided to use them as our guide in our future trips to Tibet and Bhutan or even to trek the Mount Everest basecamp. Naturally Nepal, once is not good enough, we have to thank Rajan and his team who were the ambassadors of Nepal that contributed to our wonderful experiences. We will definitely return for more and pass our good words around to recommend and appreciate them. We hope you find the above helpful. Our humble experience assures you that your decision to use Rajan and his team will not disappoint you.Be blessed by Earthbound Expeditions so that you can be a blessing to our lovely Nepalese friends.

Rajan was always very prompt and detailed with his email communication, which immediately made him stand out from other tour agencies who I was considering. He accommodated my last minute variations and tailored the trip exactly to my time constraints and interests.My biggest concern was that I would turn up to find I had been scammed. But everything lived up to, or exceeded my expectations. The hotel he had arranged for me in Kathmandu was fantastic. Almost too good - I felt like I wasn't experiencing the true Kathmandu, by staying at something so nice! But it was a comfortable way to get introduced to the environment before the challenges of treking to Everest, so was perfect for me.When I finished the Everest trek ahead of schedule and returned to Kathmandu 2 days early, Rajan immediately came to meet me and altered the itinerary accordingly, fitting in extra activities. While I expect you can shop around and find some things cheeper, my main priority was for everything to run smoothly and for plans to be flexible. Earthbound Expeditions (ie. Rajan) was fantastic for me - no surprises at all. Considering everything, I am happy with the value for money I received.The guides organised through Rajan had good enough English to provide a good service. ie. they had strong accents but they understood everything you asked. While treking, I encountered some guides who had better English, but I saw some that were much worse. Most importantly, they were as friendly and flexible as Rajan, which was very helpful."

We hope to join you when you return back to Nepal... :)My family and I took the Everest-Taj Mahal Tour with Earthbound Expeditions - December 2008.. In Nepal, what we enjoyed most were: the mountain flight over Everest / Himalayas and our visit to mountain towns of Nagarkot and Dhulikhel, not to mention the Nepalis themselves. From Nagarkot, we had about a 15 km hike to Baneppa and from there rode public buses to the mountain resort of Dhulikhel. The hike was memorable because we had the opportunity to interact with the villagers and children. We saw scenic views: waterfalls, rice terraces, farms, hills, and mountains - so different from the chaos of Thamel/Kathmandu. By riding the public buses, we were able to be up close and personal with the local people. We had tea with a family while waiting for the rain to stop and for the bus. In Dhulikhel, we had a good view of the Himalayas right from our breakfast table while being served freshly cooked omelettes.We hope to return to Nepal and go to Pokhara and Annapurnas. Again, with Earthbound Expeditions who gave us a very professional and personalized service. Rajan (president) did a good job of planning and coordinating our trip. He customized a tour for the three of us. He responded promptly to my every email or inquiry. Throughout our stay, he monitored or coordinated our daily activities. Rajan also deployed the best staff to take care of us: G.P., our skilled, careful, and caring driver; Salik, our tour guide for the Kathmandu sites, who gave an in-depth and insightful lecture on the temples and on Hinduism/Buddhism; and Shree, our guide in Nagarkot and Dhulikhel, who was resourceful, reliable, and went beyond the call of duty. He even found the best-tasting radish and soy beans for us to eat while we hiked. Thank you, guys! You are great and we miss you.I think the best asset of Nepal is its people. As a people, the Nepalis are gentle, warm, and friendly. In India, we did the Golden Triangle of Jaipur, Agra, and Delhi. The Taj Mahal lived up to our expectations \u2013 despite the day starting out foggy which can affect your view of the Taj. We were very comfortable in the Holiday Inn in Agra and Jaipur. They offered complimentary bottled water in the rooms \u2013 nice touch. Clark International Hotel in Delhi was interesting because it was located right in the middle of the action, close to everything. We had a good driver in Jaspal and a competent tour guide in Gaurav.By the way, there were power outages in Nepal when we were there. So, while the hotels could run on back-up power generators, it was not enough power to run the heaters, if any. So, be ready to layer and bundle up if you come during the winter. In Dhulikhel, we were given hot water bottles to keep warm in bed \u2013 that worked! All part of the cultural experience. Tip to travelers \u2013 never expect your destination to be like home. If you do, then better stay home. Open mind, open heart! B,C, & G Gonzales, San Diego, US."

They encouraged me when i thought i couldn't walk anymore, ensured that i went uphill 'slowly' so as not to burn out and watched out for me the whole time. The nature, views and people are incredible and i will definitely be coming back for more trekking with EE. Chitwan was also fantastic and this part of the tour was again organised by EE. I swam with elephants which was a truly awesome experience. The accommodation in Kathmandu was also very nice and Rajan can organise for you to stay in whichever area of the city you like. As i was there during Diwali it was a bit manic and part of my trip had to be rearranged but they did this without any hassle. I was also invited to spend the brother/sister ceremony with Rajan's family which was a truly memorable experience and i felt honoured to be invited.

It was an amazing experience, and I hope you will consider it too if you are reading this. The villages and views along this route are like stepping back in time. The views of the three peaks of Annapurna were so magnificent, but equally amazing was walking along acient stone steps used by villagers who have lived here in this high mountains for centuries. We saw people plowing with water buffaloo, local brew being made, old women in colorful skirts and hand-embrodiered tops wearing beautiful beaded necklaces carrying heavy loads in baskets on top of their hears, and barefoot! We sat in the morning watching the sun turn the tops of Annapurna pink, and drank hot tea and ate momo's in a Tibetan teahouse at night. You can't help but feel special to be given this opportunity to visit this remote corner of the world, and Earthbound did a superb job in supplying us with a great guide, Narendra Timalsina, and a good route for us to take. I look forwrd to doing it again-I hope soon-and this time maybe go farther. I will aslo add that the rigors of the uphill climbing is quite a test of physical endurance if you are not used to backpacking-I'd advise you get in shape and you'll enjoy the trekking so much more!! Best of luck to all going to the mysterious and ancient Kathmandu--you will have a Friend in Rajan and Earthbound Exped.! when my luggage didn't show up right away, he was so helpful in assisting me with trying to locate my bags.

They were very accomodating toward our need and request. We wanted to try a nonconventional trek (Tilicho Lake, tea house trekking) and we found them really prepared. They took care of us from airport pick up. Our guide (Sidip) and porter (Gokul) were both very prepared. Alway nice and careful. They were able to understand how we were feeling just looking at us. They knew every single stone of the path we were walking on. We had always good accomodations. The accomodation in Kathmandu was also very good (Samsara Hotel). Rajan, chief of Earthbound Expedition, took us to a restaurant for a tipical Nepalese evening. He was really very kind, hospitality was great! We really recommend Earthbound Expeditions!http://www.earthboundexp.com.np/"

When we arrived in the office all the staff were very friendly and helped us with any quires we had about the trip, this was excellent as it made us feel that everything had been perfectly planned and we were in to have an amazing trek. Kalos, our sherpa was brilliant. He always had a lovely big smile on his face when he came to collect our bags and was always great to talk to. He also gave us excellent advise for when we were trekking in the mountains. We both have great respect for the job he does, as it is not easy to walk in the mountains carrying just a day bag let alone both of our luggage. Gadul, our guide was just fantastic. His wealth of knowledge about the mountain range was amazing and any question we ever had, he was always more than happy to answer them. You could tell he is an experienced guide. Gadul made our trip so enjoyable, not only was he a wonderful guide that made us feel safe and at home in the mountains, he was such a lovely person. He again always had a great big smile on his face to greet us in the morning. On the trek we were constantly laughing and enjoying Gadul\u2019s company and he would always go above and beyond to make sure we were well looked after and happy. I recommend this trip to anyone, it really was a trip of a life time and Himalayan Glacier were such an amazing company to go with!"

My friend and I joined a 12-day custom \u201cluxury\u201d trek to Ama Dablam Base Camp in Nepal organized by Himalayan Glacier. This was my second trip to Nepal organized by HGT, and they made planning this trip extremely easy. We were not disappointed by their professional service. HGT developed a custom itinerary for us, answered all of our emails promptly and executed every detail of the trip. We had an unforgettable experience; our guide Gadul Tamang is very experienced and knowledgeable about the Khumbu region and mountain ranges. He always provided great assistance to us and ensured we were comfortable throughout the whole trip! We would definitely choose HGT and guide Gadul Tamang again!The trek itself was beautiful, the views and weather were great and we got to see some amazing views of the Himalayas and Ama Dablam. The six nights in \u201cluxury\u201d accommodation with private bathroom and warm shower were definitely a treat. We stayed at the Yeti Mountain Lodge in Phakding and Thame; and the Everest Summit Lodges at Pangobche, Monjo and Lukla. During the other nights we stayed in traditional tea houses.I would highly recommend HGT, our guide Gadul Tamang and this trek to Ama Dablam."

This October my friend and I had an amazing experience trekking to Ama Dablam base camp with Himalayan Glacier (trekking). Himalayan Glacier organized a private luxury lodges tour for us from Lukla through Namche, Thame, Khumjung, Portse and Pangboche to Ama Dablam base camp and, of course, back. The amazing experience was enhanced by fantastic weather and the best guide we've trekked with - Gadul Tamang. Gadul was always very friendly, kind and attentive. The company, Himalayan Glacier was very responsive when booking the trip. They tailored the trip to our time schedule, preferences and style. For most of the trek we followed the typical Everest Base Camp trek, or Everest Luxury Lodges/View trek. Except, we did not go all the way to base camp but rather visited Ama Dablam Base camp from Pangboche and trekked back. We added Thame to the itinerary. We loved visiting Thame. It is not often on the typical Everest BC trek. We highly recommend this addition. One of the most charming Sherpa villages. Along the trek, from Namche, thru Portse and Pangboche and on the way to Ama Dablam BC we had amazing views of Everest, Lhotse, Lhotse Char, Nuptse and Ama Dablam itself. We highly recommend this 11 day itinerary and the luxury lodges. The views are spectacular. The lodges we used were the Yeti Montain lodges and the Everest Summit Lodges. We also highly recommend Himalayan Glacier and Gadul Tamang. They provided outstanding service and a most memorable experience. We loved our trek and time In the Everest region. We'll definitely return again."

Thanks to Naba the organiser and the company owner, Karma excellent , helpful and flexible tour guide and a very friendly and accommodating driver Pema. I highly recommend Himalayan glacier trekking with out any hesitation. They were very prompt and quick in getting back to our queries. once we shared our trip duration, hotel locations and standard we prefer, Naba was very good in finding and recommending perfect hotels for us. We had six days trip to Bhutan visiting Paro, Thimpu,punakha and two days bhumdra trek- with overnight stay at a very luxurious camp site at 4000 metres height. We couldn't believe they managed to provide us double bed and mattress in a tent at that height. Camp was very clean and maintained to high standard. Every hotels they booked for us were of highest quality standard, food was amazing and they were located in beautiful nature. We only wished we had extra day in every hotel we visited. Trip was organised so well we never felt rushed in any place. We had ample to spend in each location visiting local attractions and shopping as well. Team were very helpful in understanding our needs and pointed us in the right direction for food, shopping , places of attraction etc. we received excellent service and we certainly will use their again in future with out a doubt. We did not do any water sports or biking, if we had the time we would certainly consider adding that to our itinerary. Bumdra trek requires moderate fitness and you can hire porter to carry your stuff . No need to carry sleeping bags for trek as they provide everything you need, you just need to carry clothes to change , tooth brush and paste, water and snacks , ( they provide breakfast, lunch and dinner)"

The company also provided a fabulous porter named Fulman who helped carry our large duffel bags up the mountain.Even though the trek was quite strenuous, Tulsi and Fulman both made the trip much easier by helping us every step of the way. Initially our flight to Lukla was cancelled due to bad weather, and Tulsi conveniently arranged for us to be flown by helicopter when there were no other options available. He was also very helpful with little things along the way such as food advice, medical help, etc.All in all, this was a great experience. If you are planning to do this trek, I recommend choosing Himalayan Glacier and requesting Tulsi as your guide, if he is available."

As it was on my Bucket List somehow I grasped the chance to join him. This was how I met the guys from Himalayan Glacier Trekking. Frankly speaking my expectation were not such as high as my experience from travelling in Asia framed me in a certain way. It was at my surprise then to learn how perfectly Ms. Urusha organized the trip upfront with no question being unanswered, then being accompanied by Narayan and Rishi who took perfectly care about us during the 5 days walking. Even if it is possible to explore one\u2019s own way during the lower level hills (up to 3.800 m) of Nepal the taking care of the team of Himalayan Glacier simply let us feel relaxed and provided a hunch of luxury. It is definitely worthwhile to spend the money here. Thank you to the MD Mr. Narayan Regmi who did not want to miss the chance for a personal exchange of ideas and information by inviting us to a gorgeous dinner once being back to Kathmandu. The professionalism and personal taking care of only two of us before, during and after the hike let us think to come back ASAP \u2026 the Annapurna Base Camp tour is waiting \u2026 Thanks again to all who made this trekking trip such an unforgettable event to us."

It was with some trepidation I left my wife (she was volenteering in Kathmandu) and put myself totally in the hands of the Himalayan Glacier team on the 23rd May for a trek to EBC via Gokyo lakes. Conventional wisdom suggests that the end of May / beginning of June is the start of the monsoon season and signals the end of both the climbing and trekking season - but this also opens up the opportunity to experience this fantastic trail as nature intended - uncluttered footpaths and mountains with only the occasional clashes of other Trekkers and tourists. With the right apparel either umbrella (as our guide carried) or \u00a3300+ breathable coat (I may re-think my wardrobe) the occasional shower was a small price to pay for the peace and tranquillity of the trail. Our trekking team of myself, Mel and Lucy coupled with our two porters and guide, Gadul + (sorry guys can't remember how to spell your names), we soon established a comfortable but hard pace and easy enjoyable bantering, which added greately to the trip.The organisation of the whole enterprise was exceptional, great advice from the guide, exceptional support from the porters and excellent tea house stop overs to rest weary limbs before each day. This was exemplified when at the end of the trek we found our flight back to Kat cancelled and the guide and team back at head office arranged helicopter recovery for us - thus avoiding missed international flights back home.My advice to anyone considering this trek is \"stop considering and get booking - you won't be disappointed\" however do read all the kit list carefully and do come prepared, I'd definitely recommend DIY water purification and a trip to the docs for a course of antibiotics just in case ;-) .My last piece of advice is don't forget your cards, dhumbal is compulsory, but please be warned cheating also needs to be practiced - anything from chanting mantras to concealing jokers is fair game :-).Lastly a big thanks to all the team, joking apart, this has been one of the best experiences of my life and I really don't think I could have enjoyed myself anymore with a different company or trekking buddies. When I return to Nepal to trek some more of the Himalayas it will be with Himalayan Glacier."

Sangita and Sneha were very helpful and responsive during the planning phase and were very responsive to emails. In fact, not too long after the earthquake occurred, they were in contact with me since our scheduled arrival was within 2 weeks and they offered to reschedule our trip for this year at last years price. We did a trekking trip through the Annapurna Sanctaury (with its never-ending steps!) with our guide Tulsi, who was very good. Based on my husband's interest in birds, he suggested we visit Chitiwan National Park after our trek and made all the arrangements for us at a very reasonable price. We also had a couple of day tours in Kathmandu arranged by Himalayan Glacier, which were nice. I would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier and visiting Nepal. It's safe and rebuilding is under way after the earthquake."

The hotel was fine and I was invited to awkward welcome dinner with tour guide who seemed to not want to be there. I signed up for volunteering days and said from get go I would like to work with kids. When I got to HGT office, they kept pushing construction work on me and when I said I wanted to work with kids and said this from beginning they didn't have a plan.When I was sent to town in Gokura, I was told it would be a bus. It was a death trap for 5 hours where 23 people were crammed on a 15 seat bus and the driver was darting through winding mountain roads. If you google bus accidents and Nepal, they are monthly and due to overcrowdeding and poor driving. HGT showed little regard for my health and well being.When I got to Gokura, I met with a tour guide and I demanded to speak with his boss and I said I was never told I would be put in such an unsafe bus. He then tried to flip it on me and say I wasn't up for experiencing life like a local. I said I refused to ride another bus like that and demanded a private driver or safe ride, which he said was not possible and we had to cancel the volunteering portion.I wasted a day in a non-air conditioned hotel HGT placed me in with poor service and a thin mat for a mattress. It was pitched to me as best hotel in town aka cheapest for them to maintain their margins off me.We agreed to do a trekking trip for four days and the guide and sherpa were cool.I spent a few extra days in Pokhra and then returned to Kathmandu. The manager insisted on meeting me at my hotel at 8:30 AM to discuss my trip. I agreed but he then no showed. When I called him later, he said he was there, but I was asleep. I called him out and said I was sitting there in the small lobby at agreed upon time. After I told him this, there was a long pause and no response.I then asked him, why he was lying to me. He said he called and hotel staff said I was asleep and I said no, I was eating breakfast in area visible from lobby. He couldn't keep his story straight.All they care about it money. Lied to me. Had no regard for my safety and well being. You can get guides and find groups once you arrive in Kathmandu at a much cheaper price than HGT. I felt like they took me for a ride and were full of crap.I know they have good reviews, but I am telling my story to let people know my own experience and the disorganization and cost cutting they used that put my well-being and life at risk."

We soon found that Himalayan Glacier Trekking (HGT) was the obvious choice. They have been around for 24 years and we couldn't find a bad review on the internet. We started planning well over a year before we decided to travel. We filled out the online request for the EBC Luxury Lodge Trek offered by HGT, and in less than 12 hours we had heard back. Our first contact was with Urusha, her emails told us what we needed and explained everything we could expect on our trek. Urusha was amazing, she was more than someone on the other end of an email, she wanted to make sure we were well taken care of and there were no issues with our planning. Even after the earthquake, when we were concerned about Urusha and everyone at HGT, she contacted us to say that communications had been disrupted, but they were still working hard to make our trip the best experience possible. We were blown away by this company's dedication to our needs. When we arrived in Kathmandu, we were met at the airport by our guide, Asabir (Asi) who was to take care of us at every turn, not only on the trek, but from start to finish.First on the schedule was a tour of Kathmandu, which was included in the package. Our tour guide, Dipesh, was exceptional. He was incredibly knowledgable and gave us plenty of time to explore on our own. After the tour, we met again with Asi and Mr. Regmi, the Managing Director of HGT, to go over final preparations for the trek. Mr Regmi was wonderful. He would check in by phone every couple of days while we were on the trek to see how everything was going and to make sure we were enjoying the trek. The next morning, Asi met us at the hotel, and our trek began. We flew from Kathmandu to the Tensing-Hillary airport in Lukla. We met our porter, Bok Tao, another exceptional individual, and we were on our way. Asi is the best! Every aspect of the trek was taken care of by Asi. He made sure that our trek would be memorable but also safe. It was just us on the trek, so we were able to go at our own pace. Asi has over 15 years experience and knew the name of every mountain, glacier, village and almost every person we met. He encouraged us everyday and his knowledge and support were the reason this trek exceeded our expectations. Thanks to Asi, we made it to EBC and had a wonderful time.I've never dealt with a company who has such a complete understanding of customer service. Their dedication to giving clients the best experience possible and to their well being is rarely found. The HGT team is the best."

The trek to Everest Base Camp was an interesting warm up before climbing Lobuche East Peak. We also climbed Kala Patthar down the valley from Everest Base Camp to help the acclimatisation process and get some stunning photos of the landscape. Lobuche East Peak itself I found to be a challenging climb as it is quite steep, but with the help of Chaweng the climbing guide and some fixed ropes I made it to the top without too much difficulty! I would definitely climb with Himalayan Glacier again....I highly recommend them!"

I decided to opt against getting a porter..but after our first day of trekking, I knew a porter was definitely needed..(I packed wayyyy to much)..so of course Babu came to the rescue and managed to get a porter, who just happened to be another amazing soul to trek with for the next 10 days or so!! I honestly could go on and on about every detail of my trek and how much fun it was, especially doing it with such an incredible guide (Babu)..but I think you should find out for yourself and just book your trip with these guys!! So professional, so helpful, so accommodating and have just made some of the best memories forever!! You won't be disappointed!!!"

Instead I chose from the many tours offered by HG \"Annapurna Sunrise & Mt.

The HG porters who carried my luggage were also very helpful. I returned from the trek with no bodily or joint aches and pains, only with fond memories to last a lifetime."

We were extremely surprised with the level professionalism we received from the agency. They gave us a clear itinerary and clear gear list required for the trip. At arrival we were greeted by our guide who took us to the hotel to check-in and from there we went to their head office for a briefing session. We met with the managers Narayan who clearly explained the next steps and the procedures. Then we made our way to a charming restaurant were we had a Nepalese traditional dish \"Dal pat\". Next morning we took an early flight from Kathmandu to pokhara, from Pokhara then the agency had organised for cars (4 wheel) to take us to our trekking starting point. The agency made bookings for us in tea houses. Some of the teahouses were good and some we extremely poor. We felt that they have chosen some terrible ones (on the way back) in order to make a bit saving. We felt that way because we were comparing the teahouses around the one we stayed in and they were a lot cleaner. Our guide Tulsi was a bit rushed in the beginning, we understand that he is pressured with a schedule that he had to follow. We thought that was a bit annoying and defeated the purpose of a hike where we can relax and forget about time... after couple of days he was less pressured so we all started enjoying the trek a lot more. Overall Tulsi was professional supportive and well knowledgable about the country. We had a bit of a challenge communicating with his assistance due to the language barrier. Also, at the end of the trip we stayed with the assistance and he had organized for a pick up with in a small car, when we asked the reasons why he blamed on a new rule (and we know that our friends returns in a big car) we felt again in that situation that they were trying to make a bit of saving. We insisted on getting a big car, simply because the small car in these roads was not the safest option. After we insisted they eventually managed to get us a jeep. Overall we would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier for whoever is planning a trekking experience in Nepal. We will definitely use the agency again."

After setting out around 2am, we made the summit of Island Peak at around 9am. It was a tough climb, but worth it as the view at the top was spectacular.I have been traveling across the Himalaya for nearly 15 years and have done many treks and climbs.

We are in our 30s, are usually independent travellers and have trekking experience, but we decided we wanted some help with this trek. We wanted to have someone with experience who knows the side trails off the sections of jeep road, as well as some help carrying one of our backpacks. We decided a porterguide would be the best solution for us, and we then spent a long time researching agencies to arrange the porterguide. There are so many agencies to choose from, and we're so glad we chose Himalayan Glacier. Within only a few days of our planned departure date for the trek, we went into the HG office and met with Naba, the manager. We were worried about having to fend off an upsell to an organized tour, but Naba was amazing! We explained what we wanted, which included a flexible itinerary, only one staff to help us, and that we have final say about the route and which lodges we would stay at. Naba was entirely agreeable, and made the whole process very easy. He set us up with a porterguide and made a meeting time for the introductions for a couple days later. He also arranged our trekking permits and transportation to the trailhead (by public bus, as we had requested). The price for the agency's services was very reasonable and competitive. Naba also arranged for us VERY warm sleeping bag and down jacket rentals, at half the price that we had been quoted in the stores. Then we threw in a last minute challenge for Naba. With only 15 hours until departure, we decided we wanted a porter to carry the second bag. We emailed Naba, and he had no problem graciously accommodating this last minute change of plans. In fact, he got us a second porterguide. The trek far exceeded our already high expectations. The circuit was absolutely breathtaking. Our two porterguides, Sanjib and Gokul, were AMAZING. They were friendly, fun, easygoing, and took great care of us. Sanjib has a lot of experience with the circuit, and knows the trail very well. Gokul has less experience, but speaks better English. Although we had wanted to have final say on the lodges, we were always happy to go with Gokul and Sanjib's recommendations. They always found the best places, and always managed to get the best rooms for us. Having good connections definitely helps! We really had an incredible time with Sanjib and Gokul, and are glad to now count them as friends. We hope to return to Nepal in the future for more trekking, and without question we will arrange it again with Himalayan Glacier."

They went as far as Tadapani and headed down while I trekked all the way up to ABC Camp. This has long been a dream vacation of mine having seen friends pictures years ago of their trek to EBC. After careful consideration and with MUCH help from Sristi in the Kathmandu office, we settled on ABC. And boy am I glad we did. The scenery and people were amazing!!! What a phenomenal experience in all ways - the highlight of our recent Asia trip in my opinion. Love the Nepalese people - warm, caring and loving. And it all started with Sristi in the head office. I probably sent her 100-150 emails in preparation of this trip and she never failed to answer all my questions and calm any concerns I might have. She was amazing and invaluable! Then we met the manager. A fantastic guy who was not just concerned about our money but about our safety! A wonderful man who called the hotel that my wife and son were staying at to see how they made out as I ascended higher. From there we had the opportunity to meet our Guide and Porters. I cannot say enough good things about these men. Shankar, our trekking guide is the type of guy you could trust with your life or your 6 year old son's. He is very knowledgeable, caring (safety first) and fun loving. He was like a brother to me by trek's end. My family had a hard time saying good bye to him when we departed Nepal. Ram, one of our porters, was as strong as an ox and as loving as a grandfather type. Both of these guys were my soulmates as I trekked up to ABC camp, attending to any needs I might have and providing advice and companionship along the way. I can't say enough good things about them. My wife and son were looked after by porters named Gopal and Sanjib. My wife could not say enough good things about them. They really looked after my family, especially when Ethan got a dose of TD coming down the mountain. They showed geniune concern for my family and my son reallly bonded with them both. They became like members of my family. The whole Himalayan Glacier Company can be best described as a Family Operation. it is impossible to not feel connected to these people. Yes, it is a business, but they make it feel like a family. You absolutely must utilize this company if you are planning a trek of the Himalayas. You will not be disappointed. I certainly was not. I would rate my entire experience an 11 out of 10. I am planning to go back and do EBC in a couple of years. Can't wait. And I will insist on using the same crew-from Sristi, to Shankar to Ram, Gopal and Sanjib. Thank you HG for an amzing experience. P.S. The earthquake effects or fuel issues with India were in no way felt by our family. It was not an issue at all. Nepal is ready to accomodate. And with HG's hospitality, you will be in family like hands."

The experience was so wonderful, I decided to return to Nepal to try an Everest Base Camp hike. I was concerned about the conditions in Nepal after the earthquake and the fuel shortage and wondered if Himalayan Glacier would be able to provide the same level of service. I emailed Naba to inquire about the trip and the region's safety. His quick reassurance convinced me to sign up for the new trip. I was met at the airport by Dol Amgai, the same guide who cared for me on my Annapurna trip. He is such an asset to the company as he smooths the way at every turn. I cannot imagine trying the challenging hike without his expert knowledge, local contacts and direction. He is a friendly and fun person who cares from the heart about his clients' health and safety. With his support, I happily achieved my 3 goals for the trip...experience the flight to Lukla, reach Everest Base Camp and see some yaks. Dol is no longer just a guide that we hired to help us, he is a true friend that I'll always remember! Thank you to Naba, Dol and the company for making this trip of a lifetime so special. Yes, beautiful Nepal is safe! Go...now! :-)"

We planned our EBC trek over a two year period (the 2015 earthquake caused us to postpone our trek until March 2016). We selected Himalayan Glacier through a trekking friend's recommendation, and they fully exceeded all of our expectations with their responsiveness, thorough explanations in answer to our questions, and patience and reassurance with handling our concerns about safety, etc.Our trek was 'picture perfect'--no one got ill, no dysentery, no altitude sickness. We attribute our healthy trek from start to finish to our amazing guide, Giri (Dev Raj Giri). Giri, a very experienced guide, took extreme care to make sure that we were staying hydrated, eating properly (he insisted that we eat 3 meals a day even when we felt too tired to eat), recommending which foods to avoid at which lodging and lunch locations, and showing great sensitivity at handling our occasional headache. One of our group had a bout of tummy trouble at the beginning of our long day to reach EBC, and Giri worked with her, supporting her, and ensured that she healthily and successfully reached base camp. He is well-known to other guides and tea house/lodging staff, giving us added assurance that we were in the best of hands. He let us use his phone to call loved ones at home (US), too--eliminating the need for a SIM card or relying on the iffy wifi that was avaialble at some of the higher altitude inns. Jiri, our assistant guide, was a quiet and calming influence on our group, sometimes leading, often 'bringing up the rear' to complete the team effort. We saw beautiful vistas, amazing sights (an avalance in the disstance, yak 'trains' moving across thin trails, monks chanting at Tembouche Monastery). While we worked strenously to complete our trek, our guide's guidance and his uncanny ability to know what we needed (words of encouragement, assistance with carrying our daypacks, a Snickers bar when energy was failing) ensured that we completed the trek on time and safely.  We talked with many other trekkers during our trek and we were the only group that experienced no ill effects (tummy trouble, altitude sickness). We attribute it to the care and intelligent way that Himalayan Glacier operates--seasoned guides, known lodges, perfect pacing."

Himalayan Glacier was quick to respond via email and incredibly flexible in making an itinerary that suited our needs and budget. Once we arrived in Kathmandu, Narayan looked after us incredibly well - took us out to breakfast, introduced us to our guide and provided us with great advice. Our English speaking guide, Kewel, ensured our safety along the trail as well as answered all of our many questions about the culture, landscape and trek. While we met many people on the trail that didn't have a guide, I am incredibly satisfied with our choice to hire a guide - the information and ease of travel they are able to provide is invaluable and for a first time trek in Nepal we saw it as money well spent. I was so impressed when Narayan checked in on us throughout our trek to ensure everything was going well. I would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier Trekking, they treat their staff incredibly well and provide their customers with top level service! Note: If you plan on doing the Annapurna Circuit, try to go to Tilicho Lake if it is safe to cross and you feel comfortable crossing the rock slide. It made crossing the pass so much easier since we were able to acclimatize with the few extra days. Also try to trek the whole circuit if you have the time. Tourism has declined in some of the lower elevation villages with the construction of the road and they could really use the business!"

We organized the tour once we arrived in Kathmandu by talking to Naba, who gave us some great advice and catered the trip according to our time constraints and what we were interested in. There was only 2 of us and we had Babu as our guide. Babu is a top guide but because there were so few tourists in Nepal when we visited he was happy to work as our guide/porter - which meant he carried one of our bags and while still being an excellent guide. We really found our experience with Babu amazing. He enabled us to chat with all the locals we met along with way and gave us some good information about the area. He was also really easy to get along with, very friendly and looked out for our needs (and seemed very responsible and capable). You don't need a guide to do the Annapurna circuit (and this is the first time I have ever used a guide, and I do a lot of trekking) but I think the experience we gained with Babu was definitely worth it. I would also strongly suggest now is a great time to visit Nepal as there are so few tourists (and they are in need for tourists!). The Annapurna Circuit has a reputation for being so busy but when we went in December, the combination of the season, earthquake and fuel blockade, meant we were often the only people at the teahouses! December was a great time for trekking. It was cold, but beautiful weather. Highly recommend!"

Once we arrived, our tour guide and driver did everything possible to ensure we were comfortable and enjoying our trip. As vegetarians, aside from one small mixup, we were always presented with a range of food choices that met our dietary needs. The hotels (we opted for the standard, 3 star accommodation) were perfectly comfortable, although a bit breezy/cool in January, the middle of winter.

The route, far up near the border with Tibet, had been closed since the April 25 earthquake and its aftershock last year. The trek was not easy, but Himalayan Glacier stepped up and made it all run smoothly. Naba, one of the principal figures at Himalayan Glacier, met with me personally over lunch to see what my interests were. My guide, Ashish, helped me hunt for the best equipment, taking my limited budget into account. He handled all the permits and bus tickets, and was a genuine friend on the trek.Langtang itself has been hit hard by the earthquake. The aftermath is everywhere, and the entire village of Langtang is now sitting under rubble. This creates one part of the trek where it's highly advised to bring your own lunch, owing to a significant distance (6-8 hours) between meals. However, more people should really go on this trek, both to get a better sense of the devastation that has racked the country as well as help in the recovery. Every person who goes on this trek and visits Kyanjin Gumba is helping bolster the many families who are still living and working there.The view from any one of the peaks ringing Kyanjin Gumba is worth the trip, but the opportunity to help the community makes it a can't-miss. I thank Himalayan Glacier for giving me the opportunity to see this, for their unwavering support and commitment to what turned out to be an unforgettable experience."

Prior to the tour, we were always in contact with Vidya via email and she was great and responsive to all our inquiries and concerns. She was a big help in accommodating to all our requests and we were so happy to meet her in person in Kathmandu. In addition, I lost my wedding band at the hotel and we contacted Himalayan Glacier to ask them pick it up for us.

Everything went smoothly and Pradip had everything well planned and organized. The trek itself was physically challenging, but doable even without significant training before hand. The sights were incredible, as expected. I will definitely return to the Himalayas either for the Island Peak trek or Anapurna, and will use Himalayan Glacier again."

We found a country and a people for whom life just goes on, that are welcoming more than ever the tourists and gifting us their most solar smiles.We arranged a short hike on the foothills of the Annapurnas just a couple of days before going to Pokhara, and everything went more than smoothly. We enjoyed much the luxury of sharing a guide and a porter for the 3 of us, which allowed us to fully concentrate on the ascend and descent of the infinite steps of the trail (!!), and to play Nepali card games with our companions each night after a good hot shower and warm dinner!"

Himalayan Glacier made my trip everything I had hoped for and more. Our guide, Rishi, picked us up at the airport and from that time on everything was taken care of for us. We hiked the Annapurna loop including Poon Hill and then the Everest Trail. Rishi was wonderful - brought coffee to our room in the morning, shared so much information about Nepal and everything we were seeing, answered the hundreds of questions we asked, gave us encouragement when we needed it, and was always patient and kind. He also has a wonderful sense of humor and we had fun and laughed a lot! I celebrated a birthday while hiking the Everest Trail and he even managed to have a birthday cake (with candles) for me when we arrived at our lodge that evening. Our porters, Prokash and Sumon, also did an amazing job. Our bags were always waiting for us, clean and dry, at our lodge.We also spent a week in Bhutan and had a wonderful time with our guide, Sonam, and driver Sangay. We visited monasteries that were hundreds of years old, and Sonam shared the history with us in such a way that we felt as though we were living it.I hope to go back to Nepal in the next year or so, and I will definitely go with Himalayan Glacier Trekking, and would love to have Rishi as our guide again."

We had the best service by Rissi and our porter Sandib. Our private cultural tours by Paras were fantastic. We not only visited the cultural sights but also had private cars and really decent hotels in both Kathmandu and Pokhara. When the gas crisis affected some air travel, Naaryan was quick to refund us the difference in cost for driving. The entire time I felt like our guide Rissi was looking out for our best interests. In one instance we wanted to rent a motorcycle to go around the lake in Pokhara and Rissi negotiated down to a third of the price that the vendor wanted. Rissi even purchased a muda for me when I was paragliding and I absolutely love it (I paid him back immediately, of course). I would recommend all my family and friends to have a trip organized by Himalayan Glacier. I will do a Everest basecamp trek one day and would put my all my trust into Himalayan Glacier to get me there and back safely."

I can still not believe that I did them all. I couldn't do this without the help from my amazing guide Babu, who guided me true all difficult parts. Babu a big thank you for you, for being a good brother, taking good care for me. I will never forget. Also a big thanks to Naba for arranging my trip smoothly.Frequent asked questions:Is it safe to travel in the solo Kumbu area after the earthquake? YES! The trails are in a good condition. There was a small land-sliding area just before Cho La Pass, Babu guided me safely to the other side. You will not travel in this area if you do only EBC or Gokyo Ri. Teahouses which got damaged during the earthquake are repaired or rebuild.Is it safe to travel alone (female) with a guide?Yes this is no problem at all! My guide took excellent care for me and had professional manners. In the teahouses I had my own room.Why travel alone?You walk at your own pace. It is easy to meet people underway in the teahouses. It is also a great opportunity to build a friendship with your local guide. And yes, my guide spoke excellent English.Why a guide?A guide is there for your safety. If anything happens he will take care for you. He can show you 'inside' Nepal. He will arrange that everything goes smoothly.A wish came true by doing this hike. It was a life changing experience. Once again thank you so much. Warmest wishes to everyone from the HG-team. I wish you a great season & happy Dashain."

Unsure what to do, Himalayan Glacier emailed that they were resuming tours in late May. Not wanting to pass up this once in a lifetime opportunity (literally, we were both between jobs and had could spend the month travelling) we hopped on the plane and eventually landed in Kathmandu.We were the only ones that came, so it was just the two of us, our guide Tulsi, and our porter Rahm. Given the circumstances, the expertise of the entire Himalayan Glacier team was a welcome blessing. Due to risk of landslides, we changed our trek from the Everest base camp to Annapurna base camp. They made it clear that we had full control of our trek, but they acted as trusted advisers at every step. Tulsi knows all the owners of the lodges at each village and camp, and by reaching out to his network he knew exactly where we could go that would be safe, open, and good for a hot meal.Before our trek, we got a tour of some of the fantastic temples (unfortunately damaged by the earthquake) and sights of Kathmandu. Himalayan Glacier took care of the hotel (the lovely hotel Aryatara in our case), all the flights, and transportation & sightseeing. We were never left wanting, we had a driver, guides, and fantastic service at the hotel. Tulsi even took us out to the markets in Kathmandu and made sure we were properly equipped.In terms of treks, Annapurna may not have the same name appeal as Everest, but it's a beautiful region. Greener than the Everest trek, the lower altitudes are almost tropical . Plenty of wildlife, including monkeys, buffalo, ponies and burros, goats, as well as village cats and dogs. As you start to climb it gets cooler, and you have fantastic views. The ever-present landmark is Mount Machhapuchchhre (\"fishtail mountain\") names for it's unique identitiy.Stays at lodges are fun. Due to high vacancies, we typically got the best room in the house (with attached bathroom / shower). All the food is covered, and you'll be hungry. Dal Bhat is more or less the national food of Nepal, and I highly recommend it. We were coming up against the rainy season, but Tulsi was very good at getting us to the destination village before the afternoon rains. We didn't get rained on once.Due to landslide concerns, we didn't go all the way to Annapurna Base Camp (again, our choice, Tulsi was ready to take us if we desired), so we trekked around at the lower altitiudes. We ended our trek at Sarangkot, a village overlooking Pokhara. Instead of hiking back to the city, we gave all our things to Rham and Tulsi and then Parasailed down!All in all, it was an experience to last a lifetime. I can't recommend Himalayan Glacier enough, and will strive to make it back if I can ever get a month of again."

I'd love to do another trek with Hira, Padam and Bishow - can't thank these three enough for an amazing experience. We had to change our schedule in the 2nd half of the trek and it was seamless on our end; they took care of changing any lodging arrangements and worked out flight changes out of Lukla without us ever having to worry about it. They are very focused on health and safety, both for us and their crew, and they have a ton of knowledge of the mountains. It's not a cheap trip, but the value of what you're getting is well worth it (transportation in Kathmandu, flights in and out of Lukla, lodging and meals every day, and their expertise in the mountains to name a few). In terms of the Gokyo Ri trek itself, it's the most beautiful setting I've ever experienced. We did this in late march / early april and got to experience a wide variety of terrain (including snow). There are definitely some days of tough hiking in terms of climbs, but nothing technically challenging. A great trip for anyone looking for a beautiful trek."

Words cannot begin to express how I feel, and how grateful I am to the team at Himalayan Glaciers to have put together an error free and splendid trek for me along with my partners on trek ( 8th March 2015 ). the whole trek has been cast in fond memories which i shall cherish throughout and because of the trek and Himalayan Glacier have now developed a yearn to summit Sagarmatha !.Naba ( co founder and overall incharge of operations ) has put together an excellent organisation both in terms of customer delight ( not just satisfaction ) and the professional team of guides and support staff.Right from my very first interaction on email with Urusha from Himalayan Glacier i could tell by the way all my queries over the weeks were answered patiently and with all details that i had made the right choice in going with Himalayan for the trek. Urusha not just answered all my queries but was most helpful in providing various other inputs both with regards to trek and for things to do at Kathmandu.We were a group of 4 ( my Australian mate, a German and an Indian and all of us gelled and hit off the trek with fun and close bonding ) and were accompanied by Dol ( main guide ), Biru ( assistant guide ) and 2 porters ....so for the 4 trekkers we had an equal number of support staff !!!! Amazing....Dol has been the most clam and composed guide one could have asked for, his knowledge about the Himalayas, its people, the nature and the trek were beyond any fault. He took great care to ensure all our likes were catered to throughout the trek and at times he anticipated our needs in advance and had them met with in advance. Himalayan Glaciers is congratulated for having trained such exceptional staff. Biru the assistant guide, is another prized catch Himalayan Glaciers have and shall one day turn into an exceptional guide himself under Naba and Dol.We could tell from the places we stayed at and the kind of food we ate that we were \" royalty \" as we always had the best places with best rooms to stay and the food was exceptionally good ( i also made it a point to interact with chefs at all the places we stayed which meant we could all have food to our liking......).I can go on and on about the trek especially because everything was thought of and taken care by Himalayan Glaciers ( right from first interaction over emails to Welcome and farewell dinners and the trek in between...).I happen to be a very fussy person, however Himalayan Glacier have not once given me any time to complain about anything, cos there wasnt anything to complain upon....I do look forward to many more treks with them ...and congratulate the entire team on the exceptional work they all put in."

What a fantastic touring holiday we have just returned from.From booking our tour of Kathmandu, Nepal and the Himalayas through Himalayan Glacier's booking representative Sristi, who's response was always prompt, excellent information and a tour itinerary tailor made to suit our requests, to the many queries we had before and during our booking process, to our fantastic driver Laxman, who provided support and assistance at all times especially when we were delayed, at no time did we feel alone, or helpless, he provided an unfailing service which was above and beyond the call of duty. It was very comforting to know that this company was still there for us even after our tour had ended. Thank you so much Laxman for looking after us so well. Also our English Speaking tour guides all arranged by Himalayan Glacier, they were very informative, interesting and professional, at all times giving us a good insight into the country's culture and wonderful sights making each tour interesting and extremely enjoyable. Finally to mention the special care we received from Executive Director Naba when our flight was cancelled due to unpreventable circumstances at the airport.Naba arranged for us to stay at the same hotel, he liaised with the airline and kept us informed of any progress and when we might expect to get a flight. The car and driver was available to us for the whole of the delayed period, and it seems absolutely nothing is a bother to any of the staff but quite the very opposite, they all take the greatest of pleasure in giving their utmost assistance.Himalayan Glacier certainly excelled in in everything they did for us, an excellent, professional service from beginning to end with all members of staff. If we ever return to this wonderful part of the world we will have no second thoughts of booking with, HIMALAYAN GLACIER!"

We took a private van from Kathmandu to Sarangkot. We stayed at the Sherpa Resort with the best views of the Annapurna Range. Watched the sunrise light up the Himalayas, did a day trek to another overlook and enjoyed hot tea on the hotel roof top while watching the sunset. Enjoyed a half day tour of the sites and sounds of Pokhara; the lake, Davis Falls and cave, and enjoyed some of the best mandarins I've ever tasted. We then hopped a short flight from Pokhara back to Kathmandu and continued to enjoy some amazing views of many of the Himalayan Ranges. Overall a great experience, well planned, and saw a tremendous amount in just a few short days. Highly recommend booking your adventure with Himalayan Glacier and major props to Sristi for her help and patience."

We did something quite extraordinary and completed the tour in 8 days, rather than the recommended minimum of 12. We had the excellent guidance of Asis and our wonderful porter Raju (I highly recommend that you ask for them when getting in touch with this company), we have achieved every goal we set for this trip. Asis organised everything for us and thought of every little detail from antibacterial gel to biscuits for afternoon tea. We have seen many tour guides on the way to Base Camp who would remain behind to chat with their fellow guide hence leave their clients alone in some treacherous paths, Asis would never do that. He adjusts his pace according to the clients and he would never get you out of his sight, in case something happens. Many times when I was struggling to see the next unfrozen point in the path, he would come to the rescue and made sure I would cross that bit safe and sound. I would heavily recommend anyone to specifically ask for him."

            "review": "Recommended tour group for EBC. Having completed a trek to Mt.Kilimanjaro in Feb 2014 my wife and I decided we'd give Everest Base Camp a go. In selecting a tour company we chose Himalayan Glacier based on a colleague's recommendation. We found going through the source rather than a third party who subcontract it to a local operator (as can be the case) both saved us money and gave us a greater understanding of who we were dealing with.After feeling very fortunate in having a great group in Kilimanjaro we decided we wouldn't risk the group dynamic this time and chose to take the tour as a couple. We also took the trip over the Australian summer (Jan 2015) - which is the Nepalise winter - the main benefits of which are the lack of crowds and mainly crystal clear days. We chose the 15-day luxury trek which included a day tour of Kathmandu and approx 11 days of actual trekking. Of this 5 nights were in \"luxury lodges\" hosted by Yeti Mountain Houses and 6 nights were at tea houses/lodges. The differences between the luxury lodges and guest house/tea houses was significant particularly for those who dread communal toilets, especially in the bitter cold. We would definitely choose this form of \"glamping\" again. The Kathmandu day tour was run by a very informative guide ( forget his name) but very knowledgable, good English and plenty of stats. Whilst \"temple-itis\" set in quickly, we found the day surprisingly enjoyable and a great experience of Kathmandu city. The trekking part was run by our guide Pradip and our porter Furman. Pradip was an extremely competent guide, great English skills and knowledge of the various mountains and their peak heights. He was always ready to help and make sure we were ok. Whilst I think we're pretty straight forward and low maintenance, we really couldn't ask for anymore. Our porter likewise always carried our bags with no fuss, forever with a smile and whatever English he knew and always helping out with tea and clearing plates etc.As a team both Pradip and Furman worked very well and are a credit to Himalayan Glacier. In summary the comments we make are: * Compared to Kilimanjaro we found this trek far more enjoyable. All the various villages, proper altitude acclimatisation, and being in the midst of such a landscape was amazing.  * Of the very many tour groups in Nepal, we would recommend Himalayan Glacier to anyone for professionalism and care of Trekkers as well as proper conditions for guides and porters. Personal touches by the owner to make sure things met expectations was also appreciated. * Request Pradip and Furman to be on your group if at all possible. * Whilst trekking in winter was cold towards Base Camp (around minus 10 in the tea/guest houses at night) we preferred having more of the trails and guest houses to ourselves or a few others. Of approx 39,000 who do the trek each year, around 9,000 trek in Oct, which in our view would have made the trails and guest houses/lodges way too busy and hardly enjoyable for such a serene location. However we also note that for most of the trek, when going uphill we spent a lot of time in t-shirts and lose clothing. * The luxury Yeti Lodges were well worth it - not only was the food far better, but hot showers and bathrooms to yourself and electric blankets added a little bit of comfort to what can become a little tiresome in the guest houses.* A lot of the food on the menus arrived quite differently to what you'd expect in a western country. Tolerance of understanding that this was the Nepalise version of a favourite dish goes a long way. * Avoid potatoes or anything that may of needed preserving north of Namche Bazaar. We made the fatal mistake and thereafter stuck with staples that came from a tin or was dried ( eg pasta sauce, soups, noodles, etc ). * Take plenty of layers with you clothing wise. Beware that the 15kg limit on baggage for the Lukla flight includes hand luggage otherwise you have the excess baggage charge ( about $10 for us). * A hot water bottle will get you through cold nights - alternatively having your water bottle filled up with hot water before you go to bed can help. * Last but not least, take plenty of photos and remember that even if the view of Everest is cloudy on the way up, it may still be clear on the way down.

We visited the Peace Temple in Pokhara and the Alpine museum as well as many Buddhist temples.

We trekked through rhododendron forests with monkeys cavorting in the trees above and shared the trail with donkeys carrying heavy loads as well as young children on their way to school.

There had been an issue with the vehicle that was to be used on the Tibet tour several hours before my arrival. This did not affect my time at all.

We moved thru the deep mountain gorges. Across multiple, high suspension bridges, thru villages and along mountain trails where nothing moves unless someone carries it, from heavy stoves for the tea houses to the 4x4 beams to build houses. The constant sound of rushing, milky colored water, hundreds of feet below us was a constant reminder of the magnitude of the countryside. The mountains appeared and disappeared in the high mist, but are overwhelming when fully revealed. The resonant chanting of the Buddhist monks will remain with me forever as will the lone Yak bells along the trails. Himalayan Glacier is a first class organization from start to finish. The guide, Bimal Thapa was simply outstanding. When I needed special treatment for an injury the entire Himalayan Glacier team made sure everything I required was provided for and personally made sure I was taken care of. I will go again without a doubt. But the besides the incredible scenery the personal care show for me will remain with me always."

I saw parts of Nepal few westerners see, met some beautiful families. I even one night slept in a room that had an enormous baskets of rice drying out. And many breathtaking sunrises did I see from the mountain tops. Naba is passionate about Himalayan Glacier Trekking and this is reflected throughout his very loyal team who are more than happy to assist you in having a life changing experience when trekking with them. I will return to Nepal and when I do Naba will be the first person I will call on to organize my next trek. Job well done."

Things can go terribly wrong travelling 1000 km at such high altitudes so we wanted a knowledgeable person to plan the itinerary and arrange the logistics of passing from Nepal to China and then back to Nepal without any hassles. We found him in Mr. Naba of HGT. The whole trip was executed like a dream. He took care to arrange for us to acclimatise ourselves properly in Lhasa before setting out for higher terrain. A master visa for all twelve of us made immigration checks a breeze. The Tibetan guide was superb. Fluent in English and thoroughly professional. The driver was very skillful and he needed to be since our vehicle was travelling along winding mountain roads. Sure, some of us still experienced some AMS symptoms but we were prepared with medication and oxygen. And sure the road to EBC was torturous to say the least, but this is an adventure trip as Mr. Naba himself told us in his earlier briefing. So we were prepared to take the bad with the good. And it was good!It was exhilarating taking in the mountains and lakes, experiencing a snowfall and visiting the ancient monasteries. Not your run-of-the-mill type of holiday definitely.

I was taken to the hotel (Shanker) and got settled in after being up for 40 hours! We had a welcome dinner, a tour of Kathmandu, and everything was included! We flew to Lukla and luckily had no flight issues! Our tour included the Gokyo Lakes. I was SO glad I booked this trip vs. just going to EBC and back. Our tour breaks off from the mainstream for several days. We saw so much more, it was cleaner, a lot less crowded... Beautiful! Challenging due to Gokyo Ri and the Cho La Pass, but SO worth it!! Gokyo was my favorite part of the trip. EBC was just a bonus! HGT took care of everything! I only really had to pay for tips, 1 shower, battery charging, wifi, and souvenirs!! Our guides were all great: Suresh, Uttar, and Jungbu. Uttar and Jungbu were younger and played cards with us and were very personable. They called me \"didi\", big sister. Kinda miss it! The porters were also fantastic and worked their butts off! We also had afternoon tea every day complete with \"bickies\" (cookies), and fresh cut apples after every dinner!

The guide and driver greeted us at the Kathmandu airport and escorted us to the office where they briefed us on the trip, and gave us the sleeping bag, down jacket, blue HG bag and blue HG tshirt. We then had dinner back at our Shanker Hotel which was had good food. Four star hotel which was acceptable according to our standards. We still purified the water with steri-pen even though it purified bottled water. We always used the steri-pen for the trip and never had any gastrointestinal issues. Our guide was Bimal and he was top notch. He was polite, professional, quiet at times, but strong with his recommendations to keep us safe and healthy. For example, he explained that meat should not be eaten above Namche Bazaar. He would check for any symptoms of altitude sickness and had an emergency first aid kit on hand with medications commonly used to treat altitude sickness including Diamox and Ibuprofen. He was well versed in the culture and mountain environment based on his substantial experience leading trekking tours over the past 10+ years with over 50 trips under his belt. After the trip was over and we were back in Kathmandu, he took my wife and I out to the Thamel streets for shopping. We became friends and exchanged contact information at the end of the trip. He was genuine and sincere, as evidenced by the fact that he was constantly approached by other guides from HG or other companies who wanted to greet him. That speaks volumes of his character that everyone knew him and was friendly to him on the trail. That gave us confidence to trust him with his decision making and recommendation. Our porter was Bikram and he did an excellent job carrying our bags over the mountain terrain. He was always courteous, on time, and delivered our bags before we even reached our destination. On the second to last day with him in Namche Bazaar the four of us played a few rounds of pool together. On the last trekking in Lukla, we took him and the guide out to dinner to say farewell to Bikram. He deserved the recognition after doing an excellent job over the long hard work. The trekking experience was more difficult than we initially imagined primarily due to the altitude related issues such as the cold temperature and 50% oxygen relative to sea level when we were 5500meters above sea level. Fortunately, we acclimatized by gradually ascending, and took a rested in Namche. The itinerary was \u201crapid\u201d in part to the rapid descent. Our legs were sore by the end. I would recommend this trip only for those who are physically fit otherwise it may be difficult to enjoy the beautiful surroundings if you are having problems with leg pain from the moderate to hard trekking."

Recently, my friend and I stumbled out into the almost overwhelming chaos that is Kathmandu excitedly looking forward to a trek into the Himalayas. We were met and cared for by Dol, our guide from Himalayan Glacier. We experienced many adventures, including Holi (a funny holiday where we were pelted with colored powder and water balloons). The trek itself was a feast for the senses. The mountains were absolutely glorious; and the non-stop stairs were challenging, yet rewarding. If I ever go back to Nepal, I would have no hesitation requesting Dol as he was kind and professional. From the welcome dinner to the terrifying in-country transportation, to the fantastic trek, to the basic, yet comfortable tea houses...everything was handled expertly by Himalayan Glacier; and I would highly recommend them. Thank you for an incredible experience!"

We cannot say enough about Himalayan Glacier Trekking and highly recommend this organization to all fellow travelers!From the moment our guide met us at the airport and throughout our stay in Nepal, our experience with HGT was beyond compare. We were impressed by the attention to detail regarding every aspect of our trip: the professional orientation; our accommodations in excellent hotels; our airplane reservations; our knowledgeable and helpful guides who also showed us the less visited side streets as well as the thriving tourist section of Thamel. Though we were travelling alone, we always felt safe and in competent hands.The highlights of our trip included visiting the temples in Durbar Square where we were honored to see the current Kumari goddess; the colorful Monkey Temple; Pashaputinath with its heartrending funeral ghats and the unforgettable Tibetan Buddhist Boudhanath Stupa with its wise Buddha eyes looking down at us while monks and devotees walked around its periphery. We also visited Tibetan carpet weaving studios as well as the famous Rum Doodle Restaurant with signatures and photographs of the world's most renowned mountaineers adorning its walls. These include a photo of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, prominently displayed, who in 1953 was the first Nepali to climb Mt. Everest (Chomolungma - mother goddess of the earth in Nepali) with Sr. Edmund Hillary.We departed Nepal with deep appreciation for the wonderful people of this beautiful country and especially for our friends at Himalayan Glacier Trekking who made our visit to Nepal both joyous and unforgettable. Without reservation my daughter and I (Chori and Aama) highly recommend Himalayan Glacier Trekking to travelers with an interest in Nepal and its rich culture.Namaste and safe travels!"

It's taken me a little while to write a review, Outfitters started well, although we had a slight hiccup at the airport in having to get ourselves on the plane and off to Luckla, but once on the trek all was going pretty well. Raj and Sunil were both excellent, very supportive and good blokes. Our journey to EBC ended at Dughla at lunchtime on the 25th when the earthquake struck. Although the we were at altitude, cold and a long way from home Raj, Sunil and our wonderful porters looked after us, kept us moving, safe and eventually got us to Lobouche for a very cold and scary night. They safely led us back to Luckla, finding safe accommodation and safe paths on the damaged track. At a time of a devasting national disaster the Outfitters team got us to places in between consistent tremors up to 6.7 ! It was sad, unbelievable, tragic and still immensely beautiful. The people of Nepal are the strongest and kindest. I sincerely thank Outfitters and the team on our trek who looked after us and cared for us when we were in extreme danger. To think of us when we know their families were in very sad situations was incredibly overwhelming. I will be back, I think we have about 8 kilometres to go to finish off from where we got to, my bucket list is not complete and I want to see Nepal and the magnificent Nepalese again, my best regards and sincere thanks to the Outfitters team.

The guides kept us motivated throughout the trip and were careful to make sure that we all walked at our own paces and were well hydrated throughout. The Outfitter Nepal crew were a breeze to work with and really did treat us like part of an extended family which we were very appreciative of. I highly recommend visiting Nepal and using the services of Outfitter Nepal, especially if you want to go trekking.

I booked this trip with a friend through scoopon during February.Seems a lot of Australians took advantage of this deal.I'll try and quickly sum up the tour in pros and cons; I covered accommodation through my review of moonlight hotel who were the preferred place to stay by outfitter Nepal. Pros;- much cheaper than most tours under the same umbrella. This is the biggest pro with other competitors asking for 2500 AUD for the same tour.- experience through the tour provided the best chances for reaching base camp.- it's not so overly risk averse that you can do most things at your own pace and also have some real adventure.- with reduced numbers of tourists in the aftermath of the earthquake has made the track much user friendly with no hold ups in areas such as the suspension bridges, which also leaves more abilities in top areas for crowded free photos. This also gives the tourist more ability in negotiating prices when shopping.- our guide Hom was extremely patient and friendly throughout some extraordinary circumstances with clients sometimes acting up outside what would be \"normal\" sensible requests.- the sleeping bag provided was extremely good, warm and clean. I wouldn't take one if your okay with using another sleeping bagCons;- the current fuel crisis is causing difficulties in many areas including restaurants for example now stating \" gas free\" menus.- when arriving at the airport for the fly out to Lukla try and have your bags weighed individually on scales before checking in or have that done when actually checking in. 15 kilos combined hand luggage and checked in bags is the limit per person.Other fellow travellers might not be so rigorous when packing to the 15 kilo limit. We ended up around 20 kilos above the limit with only 7 in our party? So the costs was shared - my friend and I ensured we were below the limit excluding items that would have been nice during the walk. Recommend wearing a few sets of clothes on the plane - heavy jackets carry with you for the flight.Things to bring - just a short list.Diamox - above 2700 metres. Can't believe how many people got altitude sickness and waited until after the symptoms had struck them. Improve your chances - take them as prescribed.Aquatabs (water purification) will save you money. The last place Gorekshep is the only place where you must buy bottled water. They get their water from a muddy glacier puddle where all the livestock drink from.Take a water bladder as it's easier to sip as you walk along.A good wind breaker - imperative. Saved my bacon on the Pumori base camp hike. Minus 10 and then add the wind chill!!!!!Hiking boots aren't really that necessary when I was there. Hybrid shoes would have been far more comfortable. However I had no snow on my hike. An extra pair of lightweight comfortable shoes would have been beneficial for around the tea houses.Additional items;Ask for an additional blanket at tea houses before sleep.Buy a beanie along the trek if you like - I got a super warm one in Namche for around 300 rupees.Take a few batteries for your cameras if you can, as charging gets pretty expensive the further up the hill you go.All meat labelled yak is actually buffalo as yaks are far too valuable to just slaughter. You will find that eating meat becomes more risky to eat the further up the hill you go. This means the longer the meat has been sitting on someone's back the further up you go. Avoid when required ask your guide here.Four people of the original seven from our group made it to base camp. Three were not fully prepared - one person had a cyclists water coat as a wind breaker!!!! I suggested getting something warmer than the \"Cape\" he had.I would recommend this company due to the savings and the fantastic nature of our guide and porters. Not sure what extras you would receive from other more expensive companies."

The trek was equally well organised and Bim, our guide and the 3 porters, looked after our group of 5 brilliantly. Unfortunately, I wasn't well on the first 4 days of the trek, but Bim paced me and I was able to get to the Annapurna Base Camp, without Bim's knowledge, expertise and encouragement, I probably wouldn't have completed the trek. However, the trek was fantastic, the scenery was stunning and seeing the sun rise over the Base Camp was one of the most inspiring things I ever seen.

I recently was able to work through Outfitter Nepal's Volunteer Program and couldn't be happier with the results.In October I traveled to Khahare which is located in the Dhading District, a rural area of Nepal that was greatly damaged by the 2015 earthquake. With the assistance of more than a dozen local workmen and Outfitter's guide Hari, I was able to complete \"The Pani Project\" This project included the repairing, replacing, and rebuilding of a water system for the Shree Achane Higher Secondary School in Khahare.It was an amazing experience that would not have been possible without the excellent suggestions, help, encouragement and support from Hari Bahadur and Outfitter Nepal. An extra special thanks to Hari for all of his hard work and for his exceptional local knowledge and expertise.I continue to be inspired by the great people at Outfitter Nepal and thier commitment to rebuild thier nation. I look forward to my next trip to Nepal and working again with Hari and Outfitter Nepal."

After originally having to postpone the trip due to the earthquake, Arjun was so quick and professional in responding to our emails and rescheduling. They responded to every single email within hours. The tour itself was impeccably organised from start to finish. We were greeted at the airport and were made to feel special from the beginning to the end. BIG SHOUT OUT to Mohan our guide - what a guy - full of knowledge and interest and pride in his country - give him a pay rise Arjun!The EBC trek is difficult and many of us were tired and weary along the way, but Mohan kept our spirits high. I would recommend Nepal, the EBC and outfitter Nepal to anyone and everyone. Everything went so smoothly. Thank you for making this the trip of a lifetime.If you're thinking of booking - go for it!!!"

Hi all just returned from katmandu and a 15 day trip trekking to Anna Purna well what can I say from the moment I stepped of the plane I was out of my comfort zone it was chaotic manic and frenzied I was met by a representative of outfitter Nepal and we where soon on our way to our first hotel,,,we pulled up late and it all looked scary hotel was under renovation at the time so there where a few loose ends needed finalising,next day went on a tour of katmandu full day very eye opening tour and marvelled in sights I had never seen before,next day we started our adventure of on a 6hour drive where we would start our trek was never worried at the fuel crisis out there even when seeing thousands of people waiting for a bit of fuel we where assured tourist buses would be OK and we was. Thankfully,the trek well I can say is I'm not a Trekker in any form my training for this was a comfortable stroll round picturesque lakes where I live topping it of with a swim a couple of times a week I was comfortable in belief I would stroll round the whole circuit without discomfort,,,,,arrghhh I was in for a shock it nearly broke me ,lol.i remember the man replying to my email expressing my concerns about my fitness and if I would make the circuit,his reply was if you have a strong heart you will do it ,well I guess I have a strong heart because I got stronger every day,,17stone lump am I and I do consider myself a couch potato or did,,the trip was awesome the views where totally overwhelming the simplicity of local life upon the mountain trails where fantastic and so refreshing the leg work was calf busting but rewarding as every turn and uphill hike meant full on wild life from mountain goats in there hundreds troops of monkeys eagles etc,,the mountain tops where in sight and we was eager to get there I won't spoil it for you when u get to see the sun rise at Anna Purna base camp you will know ,,even at 6am from then all down hill very hard to turn my back on the views that I struggled to climb to see but you do and before you no it you are winding your way down trails and meandering to the bottom where you are picked up and drove back to a hotel where being deprived of luxury for a few days meant hot water and a comfy bed was 6star ,the Sherpas where immense so young so strong carrying two large bags of our gear each full credit to them the guide made you feel in good hands and overall the company outfitter Nepal did a great job even taking us out to dinner on the final night to say thank you and to get some feed back,if you're wondering about is it safe to go I would say yes deffo the city was in a bit of chaos but the mountains where so calm and tranquil,,again I'm not a big walker and I was hovering over the buy button for ages when first paying for this trip and all I can say is I'm so glad I had the nerve to push buy ,,it was eye opening culture vulture back breaking awesome and I take my hat of to this company efficient reliable and under the recent tragic circumstances which has befallen this country I'd say first class outfitter Nepal I'd go again and I'd tell all to go to hope people return in there numbers once again ,,,,ow hello to my group that trekked good meeting you ,Noel Barrington ,England"

This was a varied package of sightseeing in Kathmandu, trekking and wildlife in Chitwan NP. From the outset, our enquiries were dealt with quickly and efficiently by Arjun, who arranged the holiday for us, including a number of extras.We were met at the airport and from then onwards, the holiday and all its arrangements ran very smoothly. All the accommodation was of a good standard and the transport, whether by private car, taxi or bus, went well. Our contact \"on the ground\" was Raj, who was available for support throughout and who readily changed our last day so that we could visit a temple that we'd missed earlier.The undoubted highlight was our trek to Ghorepani and Poon Hill. Although this might be deemed easy by Nepalese standards, we found the walking to be satisfying and sometimes challenging. The countryside is extremely beautiful and varied, with farmland, villages and views of the mountains, particularly the walk up to Poon Hill to see the sunrise on a clear morning Special mention goes to our companions, guide Sanjay and porter Rajan. They looked after us well and were excellent throughout, we can't thank them enough. They are both true gentlemen and a credit to the company.For anyone thinking about visiting Nepal after the earthquake, you definitely should. There has been some damage, but all the tourist sites are up and running and there is plenty to see. It's a beautiful place and the people are lovely.We had a brilliant holiday in Nepal. Many thanks to Outfitter Nepal who are an excellent, professional company with great staff. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone."

I travelled with Outfitters for the Everest Base Camp trek (the first one since the Earthquake) at the end of August and I have to say they were so good! Originally our trek was due to leave after the first earthquake and after much panic on my side about re-scheduling my trek, Outfitters were quick to respond to my millions of emails and handled the whole situation with true profession. Our tour was re-scheduled within days. I was blown away.Our Base camp trek guides Suraj and Dipak were great group leaders and their knowledge and experience of the trail felt second to none! They were very friendly and happily answered any questions or concerns I had in great detail. I felt very safe in their hands! My friend and I also had planned to visit other areas of Nepal for which Arjun at Outfitters organised for us at no extra hassle. He had a full week and a half of itinerary planned for us to visit Pohkara and Chitwan N.P which went to plan without a hitch. I have to say our experience of visiting Nepal wouldn't of been as incredible as it was, if it wasn't for Outfitters.. So thank you!"

            "review": "Professional and responsible tour company . My friend and I booked the 12 days EBC trekking package from Outfitter Nepal via Groupon. This was our 2nd time to Nepal. We were very excited and thrilled of the altitude. Nevertheless, on the 7th day of our trek, the devastating Nepal Earthquake happened. We are really blessed and protected by God throughout the next 6 days, and I think one of the biggest reason is because we have good support of mountain guide Raj, assistant mountain guide Sunil and porters who had worked their very best to ensure our remaining trek as safe as possible. (1) Comfort On the days before the earthquake, the teahouse that we stayed are reasonably comfortable (we have make mental preparation that we are coming for trekking tour, not luxury tour). Some even with hot shower! On the days after the earthquake, the team really worked their best to get us safe, undamaged teahouse to stay. I was really blessed that none of the day I need to stay in a tent or dining hall. Many do not have places to stay, or have to sleep in dining hall / corridor. I'm thankful to our porters. Everyday they RUN (imagine to run downhill with aftershocks and landslide happened, not to forget at least 20+kg loaded on their back!) to the next village in order to secure room booking for us. During that period of time, phone network was down and it's impossible to made phone booking with the teahouse. They are like superhero.(2) Safety We have 1 head guide and 1 assistance guide for a group of 11 people. Usually the assistance guide will lead the group with the head guide as the last. Every night our head guide Raj will provide a briefing on the next day trek details after dinner. He is full of experience on the trek and can spell out the details of the trek to the team. Personally I find the briefing is really useful for mental preparation. Yeap, I didn't read the itinerary. On the day the earthquake happened, when all network was down, we rely on word of mouth and were clueless on the severity of the earthquake. Our head guide made the decision of descend base on info on hand. The decision was made for safety reason. We had met another group that delay the decision of descend and the whole group end up have to stay put in dining hall at the last pit stop - Lukla. (3) Fun We have fun and exciting moments throughout the trek. Even though after the crisis happen, with worries on our mind, we still try to have some fun (in a subdue way). Our mountain guide and assistance guide, though worried of their friends and families in Kathmandu and their village, has been very supportive to us. It was a sad moment, and I think only by understanding and respect each other can the whole team pull it through the crisis. The Outfitter team works far more than what I had mentioned above. I'm safely back home without any severe health / injury issue. I always have access to food, clean water and lodging during the days of crisis. Despite I do not have money to pay for flight from Biratnaga to Kathmandu (during crisis there were no small aircraft being able to land in Kathmandu Airport ), the company had prepaid for my flight to get back to Kathmandu. They are sincere people. They did their best to keep us safe though they have bigger worries and urgency for their home and family. Words couldn't express how much I appreciate what the Outfitter team has done. The beauty of Nepal and Nepalese will always remain in my heart."

From the moment I had emailed Outfitter Nepal to schedule my trek a year ago and till the day I left for my flight they have been right there through it all. Email correspondence was fast and easy. Outfitter Nepal was very informative and helpful. Before we went on our trek we had a nice city tour and had briefings to discuss what would happen throughout the trek. Namaraj who goes by ANDY took care of everything in Kathmandu. Our trip was led by Raj (main guide) and Sumil (assistant guide). We had a great group and enjoyed ourselves during the trek. Both Raj and Sumil were very accommodating, entertaining, helpful, and fun. Unfortunately, halfway through my trek I became very sick. It was not from AMS, I had eaten something and was having intense abdominal pain that I had to be helicoptered back to Kathmandu. Raj and Andy both took care of my insurance company and figured things out for me to arrive safely in KTM. Upon arrival I did not expect anyone from Outfitter Nepal to come visit me at the hospital. Andy showed up to check on me and to see if I needed anything. He told me he would come the next day to pick me up and take care of things. I was very thankful that I had someone there to help as I was not feeling well at all. The only people that were helping me was my boyfriend and sister who were across the world from me and they could not do anything for me in Nepal. I was alone if Andy was not there for me.Andy took care of everything till the end. He took me to the hotel the next day, made all the arrangements for the airport and even got me some gatorade! Maybe the Gatorade sounds silly but honestly it was a life saver. I came home and was hospitalized and found that I had a parasite. I am finally recovering and much better. The night I left Kathmandu... 8 hours later is when the earthquake took place. I am not sure if my illness was a blessing or a curse but I was very lucky to have left the time I did. My friend who was still on the trek was a day away from Everest Base Camp when the earthquake had struck. Fortunately, the group was not affected and because of the care of Outfitter Nepal my best friend just made it home on Sunday safely. Even in this catastrophe Outfitter Nepal stood strong and stood by their customers and for that I truly respect them. They are all so genuine and I could not ask for more. I would recommend them over and over again. They truly care and are the best of the best! Martha Ha"

Prior to the trek I was dealing directly with Arjun via email who was prompt with his responses and extremely helpful. On arrival to the meeting point at hotel Moonlight (good hotel) the group was met by Raj who gave us a detailed brief on what to expect during the trek and again answered any questions the group had. When we arrived at Lukla airport the group was met by Birodh the guide and his support staff (assistant guides/porters). The whole transition was seamless. I was very impressed by the coordination.Birodh was outstanding as the lead guide. He was very motivating, knowledgeable and observant to the needs of the group. While he was jovial throughout the trek, he was able to make the tough decisions when required (evacuating people back to Lukla) and constantly adjust to the appropriate course of action to keep the trek moving forward.I would strongly recommend Outfitter for any trek you intend to do. I had an outstanding experience and would not hesitate to trek with them when I get the chance to do the Annapurna circuit.For the trek be aware:- Although it suggests you should be able to walk 4-6h. Most days were longer than this and there are some very steep slopes both up and down, coupled with the high altitude. You need to have at least a basic level of fitness, but this doesn\u2019t mean age restrictions apply (except being too young).- Drink 4-5L water a day without fail (or whatever ensures urine is mostly clear each time). This will get you out of bed multiple times during the night but it is necessary.- People do get evacuated by helicopter more regularly than you\u2019d think due to Acute Mountain Sickness symptoms. Don\u2019t be afraid of this; just be aware as it is easily managed by managing yourself \u201cEat on time, drink on time and sleep on time\u201d.The team/guides will discuss everything else in detail for you to be aware of. Listen to their advice."

The guide at Chitwan was very difficult to understand at first but after a while we did become accustomed to his English. He was very knowledgable of the local area, traditions and especially the wildlife. We floated down the croc infested river in a dugout canoe to the jungle in order to spot rhino, wild boar, deer and other wild animals. He showed signs of where tigers had been, where rhinos had mud bathed and scratched against the trees then we saw a rhino! Later that day we went on an elephant safari through the jungle spotting many more animals - elephants don't need tracks or paths! Lastly, we went to Pokhara in the mountains. Again, a hotel in a great location and a great guide for the city tour. Our driver was very quiet and did not speak much english but he was very considerate and a really safe driver. I can't say enough good things about this company, they would do anything to help make your tour the best experience they possibly could."

Outfitter accommodated all my questions and replied promptly. Everest BC trek was mixed with adventure and unplanned struggles to which our guide and porters assisted. We did it !!!!! and after time passes I realised the extreme efforts by the team to get us there and back safely. Secondly another trek to Annapurna BC was spectacular and and different scenery to EBC... again the guide and porters kept us safe and a priority when the mountains challenged us. I'm going back again and Outfitter will be my first choice. Thankyou Outfitter for a lifetime of wonderful memories. Highly recommended!!!"

My partner and I had booked a trekking tour through Outfitter Nepal which was supposed to start on a certain date, however when we were due to arrive in Kathmandu, there had been a minor place crash in Kathmandu airport which closed it for 4 days.We were worried that we weren't able to make the trip or that our trip would be cut short, but we were ensured that our trip would remain the same when we arrive. Since we were stuck in transit for 4 days we had very limited access to communication, which made us quite worried as emails weren't replied as quick as we'd hoped.We arrived at the airport at 12 at night to which it took us 2 hours to get our luggage. As we had no real means to communicate that we had arrived, we were worried that we'd have to find our own transport and accommodation for the night. Luckily we found our guide in amongst the crowd outside still waiting for us and were taking to our hotel for the night.From then on it was all smooth sailing, the tour guide was great, informative and was helpful when needed.I'd be happy to recommend Outfitter Nepal to anyone planning to do some trekking."

Raj and Arjun were incredibly helpful always at the end of a phone their attention to detail when organising our trip was brilliant and they delivered on everything they promised. There is comfort in knowing that Outfitters Nepal are there for travellers to Nepal because it takes the worry out of having to organise trips, porters, guides etc as they do it all. I would give Outfitter Nepal a 5 star rating and would not consider travelling with anyone else when I return to Nepal."

From the first email to Arjun, requesting details of possible trips, to our final drop off at the airport at 5am everything went as smooth as clockwork. Our inward flight was delayed by 6 hours due to fog at Kathmandu Airport. We had further delays due to the large numbers queuing for visas. Despite these long delays as soon as we emerged from the airport we spotted our pick up. We have no idea how long he had to wait around for us, but he was a most welcome sight! This attention to detail was replicated in all our experiences on the tour.Our guide, Birodh, and his two assistants did everything to make our trek as enjoyable as possible. Our accommodation, meals, the pace of the trek, etc. - all excellent. As we had a spare day at the end of our trek Raj organised a tour to Bhaktapur and Patan. Again, a very enjoyable experience with a lovely guide.For anyone considering a trip to Nepal, no matter what their particular needs are, we would without hesitation recommend Outfitter Nepal as the best of tour/trekking companies."

Booking from the UK was straightforward and we really appreciated the quick responses to questions etc... Even when we had to change our flight time last minute, they were flexible in our pick up. Our whole trek in Nepal was seamlessly organised by Outfitter Nepal, we never had to worry about how we would get places or what we needed to do. Much of this is down to the excellent guides they employ. Our guide was very personable and caring and along with our porter made our trip even more enjoyable and exciting with good natured jokes and informative explanations of the local people and mountains which is priceless when you have long days of walking and sometimes need a little encouragement. We really enjoyed the trek that Outfitter Nepal put together for us up to Annapurna Base Camp and want to thank Raj and his team for such an amazing time and our guide Mohan for his outstanding leadership and company. I think what makes Outfitter Nepal an excellent choice over the many rivals out there is the individual service you receive, you are more than just another client, they know who you are, what you want to do and are keen to tailor to your needs. The fact that the co-owner Raj spent some time"

            "review": "Adventure of All Lifetimes. My new husband and I booked a special package tour with Outfitter Nepal for our honeymoon and from the absolute beginning of our emails with Arjun (one of the company directors) to their organizing a car to drive us back to the airport, we have had a fantastic experience. Because we got this tour through a special deal provider, we didn't know what to expect and thought it might be a cheap abridged version of Nepal's sightseeing potential. But instead, we had an amazing itinerary full of cultural and historical sightseeing, then a challenging and very rewarding 5 day trek to Poon Hill, a relaxing 2 day jungle safari, and a lovely farewell dinner with Raj (company manager). The itinerary was set out well: something low key, then a challenging trekking adventure, and then the opportunity to wind down again. The guides and porters from Outfitter Nepal were excellent: friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable and helpful. Within a day, our group (we had a perfect group size of 10) and the guides/porters were getting along like family. My husband and I had arrived a day earlier than the tour was officially starting, and Raj had given us the option to go on an additional day tour to visit Bhaktapur and Patan which was great. All our accommodation and food had been organised prior to our arrival; all our transitions between lodges and hotels were smooth and we didn't experience any problems or disruptions to our holiday at all.Perhaps in the near future, Outfitter Nepal could add a small amount into the fees ($10 per person maybe?) to go towards helping porters purchase good trekking gear for themselves like footwear, clothing, rain gear etc. The porters are so hard working and wonderful, I personally would love to see them getting treated well. As mentioned, the porters we had with Outfitter Nepal were fantastic. The trek level of difficulty was rated as 'easy' but for a Westerner of average fitness, I'd probably rate it more as 'medium'. Perhaps Outfitter Nepal could include a basic fitness guide to help tourists gauge if they can successfully complete the trek (example: how often do you exercise a week? Are you able to walk 5km a day with minimal difficulty? Etc). That being said, our trekking guide Santos was extremely patient and accommodating and reiterated that the trek was not a race and for everyone to go at their natural pace and listen to their bodies. We are sad to leave this beautiful country and it's even more beautiful people, but are looking forward to coming back and traveling with Outfitter Nepal again. Thank you for your hospitality! We will never forget this trip!"

My brother and I book Nepal tour with Everest Base Camp trek with Outfitter Nepal and after numerous informative replies from Arjun (of Outfitter Nepal), we booked ourselves to join the Everest Base Camp trek\\tour in early May 2014. Alongside 2 other fellow trekkers, we were introduced to our friendly guide Vim and the latter's intimate knowledge of the paths, conditions, etc made our experience an unforgettable one. All domestic flights, teahouse bookings, porters, etc were organized flawlessly. As it so happens, my brother and I were affected by AMS and had to stay in Namche for some time as a precaution. Our guide Vim was prompt to make sure that we would be looked after by the teahouse owners and organised for one porter to stay behind just in case we felt better and wanted to keep trekking. While Vim pushed on with the other 2 trekkers and another porter, he regularly kept in touch with the Namche teahouse owners to see how we were going + also advised us of the upcoming plans (ie, day that he would be back). So, while my brother and I didn't make it to EBC (through no fault from Outfitter Nepal), we felt safe in the knowledge that we were looked after at all times and were able to relax\\recuperate. While on the tracks, Vim was excellent at gauging and adapting to our various levels of fitness and desire to take pictures of the fantastic surroundings. Overall, It was such a great experience that I know that my brother and one of the other trekkers are already planning another trek with Outfitter Nepal next year. As for me, I will definitely go with them again in a few years' time with my son (when he is older) and would gladly recommend Outfitter Nepal to my friends as an excellent trekking company to go with in Nepal."

Outfitter stood out because of the speed of reply and focus on what I was hoping for out of a city tour. I am so glad I went with this tour company and many thanks to Arjun for answering so many questions in advance of arrival!I may have been the only person in Kathmandu not on a trek, but appreciated that guide Bikash understood my interest in learning about the city, culture, and temples. We had a nice balance of history, fun facts, and a little shopping. As a single female traveling alone, I felt very safe the whole time and Bikash did a great job of keeping an eye on how I was feeling in the heat. I believe the sign of a good guide is when they feel less like an escort and more like a highly knowledgeable friend. Bikash certainly achieved this!I would recommend Outfitter Nepal for their services - they were great about all coordination, quick replies, and an amazing experience during my few short days in Kathmandu. Thanks again!(Side note - Make sure you have two passport size photos with you upon entering Kathmandu. You can take your picture at the airport for a price and a little delay. Also there are two entry forms to complete. Many people missed this!)"

They looked after us incredibly well, and the cost was amazing value. Our guide, Bishnu was friendly and knowledgable, and made sure we got the most out of our trip. I would thoroughly recommend Outfitter's services to anyone travelling to Nepal, we had absolutely no complaints and would definitely book with them if and when we go back to this amazing country."

Both trips were strenuous, but the friendly and helpful team of guides and porters made them both unforgettable experiences. What is most remarkable though is that the trips were undertaken with young children (Aged 8 and 11 in 2011). They loved spending time with the team, learned to play the drums, ploughed fields with an oxen drawn plough and sang songs around a campfire in the evenings. Priceless memories for them and us. Outfitter Nepal were instrumental in the success of the trips both in the organisation from Kathmandu and the quality of their leadership in the mountains. I would recommend Outfitter Nepal to anyone considering any excursion in Nepal, particularly trips into the big mountains. I am certain that as a family we will return to Nepal and of course will again rely on Outfitter Nepal."

When we arrived in the office all the staff were very friendly and helped us with any quires we had about the trip, this was excellent as it made us feel that everything had been perfectly planned and we were in to have an amazing trek. Kalos, our sherpa was brilliant. He always had a lovely big smile on his face when he came to collect our bags and was always great to talk to. He also gave us excellent advise for when we were trekking in the mountains. We both have great respect for the job he does, as it is not easy to walk in the mountains carrying just a day bag let alone both of our luggage. Gadul, our guide was just fantastic. His wealth of knowledge about the mountain range was amazing and any question we ever had, he was always more than happy to answer them. You could tell he is an experienced guide. Gadul made our trip so enjoyable, not only was he a wonderful guide that made us feel safe and at home in the mountains, he was such a lovely person. He again always had a great big smile on his face to greet us in the morning. On the trek we were constantly laughing and enjoying Gadul\u2019s company and he would always go above and beyond to make sure we were well looked after and happy. I recommend this trip to anyone, it really was a trip of a life time and Himalayan Glacier were such an amazing company to go with!"

This October my friend and I had an amazing experience trekking to Ama Dablam base camp with Himalayan Glacier (trekking). Himalayan Glacier organized a private luxury lodges tour for us from Lukla through Namche, Thame, Khumjung, Portse and Pangboche to Ama Dablam base camp and, of course, back. The amazing experience was enhanced by fantastic weather and the best guide we've trekked with - Gadul Tamang. Gadul was always very friendly, kind and attentive. The company, Himalayan Glacier was very responsive when booking the trip. They tailored the trip to our time schedule, preferences and style. For most of the trek we followed the typical Everest Base Camp trek, or Everest Luxury Lodges/View trek. Except, we did not go all the way to base camp but rather visited Ama Dablam Base camp from Pangboche and trekked back. We added Thame to the itinerary. We loved visiting Thame. It is not often on the typical Everest BC trek. We highly recommend this addition. One of the most charming Sherpa villages. Along the trek, from Namche, thru Portse and Pangboche and on the way to Ama Dablam BC we had amazing views of Everest, Lhotse, Lhotse Char, Nuptse and Ama Dablam itself. We highly recommend this 11 day itinerary and the luxury lodges. The views are spectacular. The lodges we used were the Yeti Montain lodges and the Everest Summit Lodges. We also highly recommend Himalayan Glacier and Gadul Tamang. They provided outstanding service and a most memorable experience. We loved our trek and time In the Everest region. We'll definitely return again."

We had six days trip to Bhutan visiting Paro, Thimpu,punakha and two days bhumdra trek- with overnight stay at a very luxurious camp site at 4000 metres height. We couldn't believe they managed to provide us double bed and mattress in a tent at that height. Camp was very clean and maintained to high standard. Every hotels they booked for us were of highest quality standard, food was amazing and they were located in beautiful nature. We only wished we had extra day in every hotel we visited. Trip was organised so well we never felt rushed in any place. We had ample to spend in each location visiting local attractions and shopping as well. Team were very helpful in understanding our needs and pointed us in the right direction for food, shopping , places of attraction etc. we received excellent service and we certainly will use their again in future with out a doubt. We did not do any water sports or biking, if we had the time we would certainly consider adding that to our itinerary. Bumdra trek requires moderate fitness and you can hire porter to carry your stuff . No need to carry sleeping bags for trek as they provide everything you need, you just need to carry clothes to change , tooth brush and paste, water and snacks , ( they provide breakfast, lunch and dinner)"

The guides were all brilliant - they had great knowledge and made adjustments on the tours to suit our needs, i.e. on the trek it was pouring down and we wanted to finish a bit early, so they arranged the car to take us back to town after lunch. I would thoroughly recommend this tour company and will use them when I hopefully return to Nepal to do the Everest base camp tour."

I did this 15-day trek with another friend in September 2016. The journey was difficult, but Himalayan Glacier provided an excellent guide by the name of Tulsi Bhatta. The company also provided a fabulous porter named Fulman who helped carry our large duffel bags up the mountain.Even though the trek was quite strenuous, Tulsi and Fulman both made the trip much easier by helping us every step of the way. Initially our flight to Lukla was cancelled due to bad weather, and Tulsi conveniently arranged for us to be flown by helicopter when there were no other options available. He was also very helpful with little things along the way such as food advice, medical help, etc.All in all, this was a great experience. If you are planning to do this trek, I recommend choosing Himalayan Glacier and requesting Tulsi as your guide, if he is available."

As it was on my Bucket List somehow I grasped the chance to join him. This was how I met the guys from Himalayan Glacier Trekking. Frankly speaking my expectation were not such as high as my experience from travelling in Asia framed me in a certain way. It was at my surprise then to learn how perfectly Ms. Urusha organized the trip upfront with no question being unanswered, then being accompanied by Narayan and Rishi who took perfectly care about us during the 5 days walking. Even if it is possible to explore one\u2019s own way during the lower level hills (up to 3.800 m) of Nepal the taking care of the team of Himalayan Glacier simply let us feel relaxed and provided a hunch of luxury. It is definitely worthwhile to spend the money here. Thank you to the MD Mr. Narayan Regmi who did not want to miss the chance for a personal exchange of ideas and information by inviting us to a gorgeous dinner once being back to Kathmandu. The professionalism and personal taking care of only two of us before, during and after the hike let us think to come back ASAP \u2026 the Annapurna Base Camp tour is waiting \u2026 Thanks again to all who made this trekking trip such an unforgettable event to us."

Sneha was our travel consultant and she could not have been more accommodating or communicative throughout the organization stage. Throughout the trip we were never left wondering or guessing ... It was always clear who would meet us and where. Even with flight delays (due to weather) we always felt that Naba and Sneha and team were one step ahead!The trip to Bhutan was so special. We elected to go during monsoon season and therefore at times our schedule needed to be adjusted due to weather. Never any issues or problems, the changes made were great.Naba, Sneha and team could not have been more hospitable or caring. Even after our trip ended they helped to arrange further accommodations and car service for us. In fact they even organized a small birthday celebration at the hotel - several days after the trip had ended! If you want to do a trip and feel 100% confident that you have 'friends' looking out for your best interests you should definitely book through Himalayan Glaciers!"

It was with some trepidation I left my wife (she was volenteering in Kathmandu) and put myself totally in the hands of the Himalayan Glacier team on the 23rd May for a trek to EBC via Gokyo lakes. Conventional wisdom suggests that the end of May / beginning of June is the start of the monsoon season and signals the end of both the climbing and trekking season - but this also opens up the opportunity to experience this fantastic trail as nature intended - uncluttered footpaths and mountains with only the occasional clashes of other Trekkers and tourists. With the right apparel either umbrella (as our guide carried) or \u00a3300+ breathable coat (I may re-think my wardrobe) the occasional shower was a small price to pay for the peace and tranquillity of the trail. Our trekking team of myself, Mel and Lucy coupled with our two porters and guide, Gadul + (sorry guys can't remember how to spell your names), we soon established a comfortable but hard pace and easy enjoyable bantering, which added greately to the trip.The organisation of the whole enterprise was exceptional, great advice from the guide, exceptional support from the porters and excellent tea house stop overs to rest weary limbs before each day. This was exemplified when at the end of the trek we found our flight back to Kat cancelled and the guide and team back at head office arranged helicopter recovery for us - thus avoiding missed international flights back home.My advice to anyone considering this trek is \"stop considering and get booking - you won't be disappointed\" however do read all the kit list carefully and do come prepared, I'd definitely recommend DIY water purification and a trip to the docs for a course of antibiotics just in case ;-) .My last piece of advice is don't forget your cards, dhumbal is compulsory, but please be warned cheating also needs to be practiced - anything from chanting mantras to concealing jokers is fair game :-).Lastly a big thanks to all the team, joking apart, this has been one of the best experiences of my life and I really don't think I could have enjoyed myself anymore with a different company or trekking buddies. When I return to Nepal to trek some more of the Himalayas it will be with Himalayan Glacier."

In fact, not too long after the earthquake occurred, they were in contact with me since our scheduled arrival was within 2 weeks and they offered to reschedule our trip for this year at last years price. We did a trekking trip through the Annapurna Sanctaury (with its never-ending steps!) with our guide Tulsi, who was very good. Based on my husband's interest in birds, he suggested we visit Chitiwan National Park after our trek and made all the arrangements for us at a very reasonable price. We also had a couple of day tours in Kathmandu arranged by Himalayan Glacier, which were nice. I would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier and visiting Nepal. It's safe and rebuilding is under way after the earthquake."

The hotel was fine and I was invited to awkward welcome dinner with tour guide who seemed to not want to be there. I signed up for volunteering days and said from get go I would like to work with kids. When I got to HGT office, they kept pushing construction work on me and when I said I wanted to work with kids and said this from beginning they didn't have a plan.When I was sent to town in Gokura, I was told it would be a bus. It was a death trap for 5 hours where 23 people were crammed on a 15 seat bus and the driver was darting through winding mountain roads. If you google bus accidents and Nepal, they are monthly and due to overcrowdeding and poor driving. HGT showed little regard for my health and well being.When I got to Gokura, I met with a tour guide and I demanded to speak with his boss and I said I was never told I would be put in such an unsafe bus. He then tried to flip it on me and say I wasn't up for experiencing life like a local. I said I refused to ride another bus like that and demanded a private driver or safe ride, which he said was not possible and we had to cancel the volunteering portion.I wasted a day in a non-air conditioned hotel HGT placed me in with poor service and a thin mat for a mattress. It was pitched to me as best hotel in town aka cheapest for them to maintain their margins off me.We agreed to do a trekking trip for four days and the guide and sherpa were cool.I spent a few extra days in Pokhra and then returned to Kathmandu. The manager insisted on meeting me at my hotel at 8:30 AM to discuss my trip. I agreed but he then no showed. When I called him later, he said he was there, but I was asleep. I called him out and said I was sitting there in the small lobby at agreed upon time. After I told him this, there was a long pause and no response.I then asked him, why he was lying to me. He said he called and hotel staff said I was asleep and I said no, I was eating breakfast in area visible from lobby. He couldn't keep his story straight.All they care about it money. Lied to me. Had no regard for my safety and well being. You can get guides and find groups once you arrive in Kathmandu at a much cheaper price than HGT. I felt like they took me for a ride and were full of crap.I know they have good reviews, but I am telling my story to let people know my own experience and the disorganization and cost cutting they used that put my well-being and life at risk."

We soon found that Himalayan Glacier Trekking (HGT) was the obvious choice. They have been around for 24 years and we couldn't find a bad review on the internet. We started planning well over a year before we decided to travel. We filled out the online request for the EBC Luxury Lodge Trek offered by HGT, and in less than 12 hours we had heard back. Our first contact was with Urusha, her emails told us what we needed and explained everything we could expect on our trek. Urusha was amazing, she was more than someone on the other end of an email, she wanted to make sure we were well taken care of and there were no issues with our planning. Even after the earthquake, when we were concerned about Urusha and everyone at HGT, she contacted us to say that communications had been disrupted, but they were still working hard to make our trip the best experience possible. We were blown away by this company's dedication to our needs. When we arrived in Kathmandu, we were met at the airport by our guide, Asabir (Asi) who was to take care of us at every turn, not only on the trek, but from start to finish.First on the schedule was a tour of Kathmandu, which was included in the package. Our tour guide, Dipesh, was exceptional. He was incredibly knowledgable and gave us plenty of time to explore on our own. After the tour, we met again with Asi and Mr. Regmi, the Managing Director of HGT, to go over final preparations for the trek. Mr Regmi was wonderful. He would check in by phone every couple of days while we were on the trek to see how everything was going and to make sure we were enjoying the trek. The next morning, Asi met us at the hotel, and our trek began. We flew from Kathmandu to the Tensing-Hillary airport in Lukla. We met our porter, Bok Tao, another exceptional individual, and we were on our way. Asi is the best! Every aspect of the trek was taken care of by Asi. He made sure that our trek would be memorable but also safe. It was just us on the trek, so we were able to go at our own pace. Asi has over 15 years experience and knew the name of every mountain, glacier, village and almost every person we met. He encouraged us everyday and his knowledge and support were the reason this trek exceeded our expectations. Thanks to Asi, we made it to EBC and had a wonderful time.I've never dealt with a company who has such a complete understanding of customer service. Their dedication to giving clients the best experience possible and to their well being is rarely found. The HGT team is the best."

We were extremely surprised with the level professionalism we received from the agency. They gave us a clear itinerary and clear gear list required for the trip. At arrival we were greeted by our guide who took us to the hotel to check-in and from there we went to their head office for a briefing session. We met with the managers Narayan who clearly explained the next steps and the procedures. Then we made our way to a charming restaurant were we had a Nepalese traditional dish \"Dal pat\". Next morning we took an early flight from Kathmandu to pokhara, from Pokhara then the agency had organised for cars (4 wheel) to take us to our trekking starting point. The agency made bookings for us in tea houses. Some of the teahouses were good and some we extremely poor. We felt that they have chosen some terrible ones (on the way back) in order to make a bit saving. We felt that way because we were comparing the teahouses around the one we stayed in and they were a lot cleaner. Our guide Tulsi was a bit rushed in the beginning, we understand that he is pressured with a schedule that he had to follow. We thought that was a bit annoying and defeated the purpose of a hike where we can relax and forget about time... after couple of days he was less pressured so we all started enjoying the trek a lot more. Overall Tulsi was professional supportive and well knowledgable about the country. We had a bit of a challenge communicating with his assistance due to the language barrier. Also, at the end of the trip we stayed with the assistance and he had organized for a pick up with in a small car, when we asked the reasons why he blamed on a new rule (and we know that our friends returns in a big car) we felt again in that situation that they were trying to make a bit of saving. We insisted on getting a big car, simply because the small car in these roads was not the safest option. After we insisted they eventually managed to get us a jeep. Overall we would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier for whoever is planning a trekking experience in Nepal. We will definitely use the agency again."

It's a very well run and organized group, they took care of everything and went above and beyond on several occasions. For example, having a birthday celebration for a member of our group and arranging for airport transfers for those of us who booked a mountain flight. Keep in mind, we did this outside the organized tour, yet HGT provided a driver, no problem. Our only regret was that we did not book a longer trip as we did mostly attractions within the Kathmandu Valley. We're already talking about returning soon and booking some longer treks with HGT. They are the nicest bunch of folks, and helped leave us with a lasting impression of not only Nepal, but it's people."

I joined Himalayan Glacier's 22 day trek and climbing expedition through the Everest and Gokyo regions as well as climbing Island Peak. It was an epic journey that was professionally organized from the beginning to end! All email communications through manager Naba were clear and quickly answered. My guide, Chewang Palden Sherpa, has vast climbing experience, including 3 Everest summits. He was a great companion to have and an excellent trekking and climbing guide. He is a true professional! Our summit of 6189m Island Peak went very well. My guide Chewang took care of everything regarding the set-up of base camp. He cooked a great dinner and breakfast and was fun to climb the peak with. After setting out around 2am, we made the summit of Island Peak at around 9am. It was a tough climb, but worth it as the view at the top was spectacular.I have been traveling across the Himalaya for nearly 15 years and have done many treks and climbs. Himalayan Glacier is an excellent company. I am already discussing a climb of 6476m Mera Peak in the near future."

We are in our 30s, are usually independent travellers and have trekking experience, but we decided we wanted some help with this trek. We wanted to have someone with experience who knows the side trails off the sections of jeep road, as well as some help carrying one of our backpacks. We decided a porterguide would be the best solution for us, and we then spent a long time researching agencies to arrange the porterguide. There are so many agencies to choose from, and we're so glad we chose Himalayan Glacier. Within only a few days of our planned departure date for the trek, we went into the HG office and met with Naba, the manager. We were worried about having to fend off an upsell to an organized tour, but Naba was amazing! We explained what we wanted, which included a flexible itinerary, only one staff to help us, and that we have final say about the route and which lodges we would stay at. Naba was entirely agreeable, and made the whole process very easy. He set us up with a porterguide and made a meeting time for the introductions for a couple days later. He also arranged our trekking permits and transportation to the trailhead (by public bus, as we had requested). The price for the agency's services was very reasonable and competitive. Naba also arranged for us VERY warm sleeping bag and down jacket rentals, at half the price that we had been quoted in the stores. Then we threw in a last minute challenge for Naba. With only 15 hours until departure, we decided we wanted a porter to carry the second bag. We emailed Naba, and he had no problem graciously accommodating this last minute change of plans. In fact, he got us a second porterguide. The trek far exceeded our already high expectations. The circuit was absolutely breathtaking. Our two porterguides, Sanjib and Gokul, were AMAZING. They were friendly, fun, easygoing, and took great care of us. Sanjib has a lot of experience with the circuit, and knows the trail very well. Gokul has less experience, but speaks better English. Although we had wanted to have final say on the lodges, we were always happy to go with Gokul and Sanjib's recommendations. They always found the best places, and always managed to get the best rooms for us. Having good connections definitely helps! We really had an incredible time with Sanjib and Gokul, and are glad to now count them as friends. We hope to return to Nepal in the future for more trekking, and without question we will arrange it again with Himalayan Glacier."

They went as far as Tadapani and headed down while I trekked all the way up to ABC Camp. This has long been a dream vacation of mine having seen friends pictures years ago of their trek to EBC. After careful consideration and with MUCH help from Sristi in the Kathmandu office, we settled on ABC. And boy am I glad we did. The scenery and people were amazing!!! What a phenomenal experience in all ways - the highlight of our recent Asia trip in my opinion. Love the Nepalese people - warm, caring and loving. And it all started with Sristi in the head office. I probably sent her 100-150 emails in preparation of this trip and she never failed to answer all my questions and calm any concerns I might have. She was amazing and invaluable! Then we met the manager. A fantastic guy who was not just concerned about our money but about our safety! A wonderful man who called the hotel that my wife and son were staying at to see how they made out as I ascended higher. From there we had the opportunity to meet our Guide and Porters. I cannot say enough good things about these men. Shankar, our trekking guide is the type of guy you could trust with your life or your 6 year old son's. He is very knowledgeable, caring (safety first) and fun loving. He was like a brother to me by trek's end. My family had a hard time saying good bye to him when we departed Nepal. Ram, one of our porters, was as strong as an ox and as loving as a grandfather type. Both of these guys were my soulmates as I trekked up to ABC camp, attending to any needs I might have and providing advice and companionship along the way. I can't say enough good things about them. My wife and son were looked after by porters named Gopal and Sanjib. My wife could not say enough good things about them. They really looked after my family, especially when Ethan got a dose of TD coming down the mountain. They showed geniune concern for my family and my son reallly bonded with them both. They became like members of my family. The whole Himalayan Glacier Company can be best described as a Family Operation. it is impossible to not feel connected to these people. Yes, it is a business, but they make it feel like a family. You absolutely must utilize this company if you are planning a trek of the Himalayas. You will not be disappointed. I certainly was not. I would rate my entire experience an 11 out of 10. I am planning to go back and do EBC in a couple of years. Can't wait. And I will insist on using the same crew-from Sristi, to Shankar to Ram, Gopal and Sanjib. Thank you HG for an amzing experience. P.S. The earthquake effects or fuel issues with India were in no way felt by our family. It was not an issue at all. Nepal is ready to accomodate. And with HG's hospitality, you will be in family like hands."

We planned our EBC trek over a two year period (the 2015 earthquake caused us to postpone our trek until March 2016). We selected Himalayan Glacier through a trekking friend's recommendation, and they fully exceeded all of our expectations with their responsiveness, thorough explanations in answer to our questions, and patience and reassurance with handling our concerns about safety, etc.Our trek was 'picture perfect'--no one got ill, no dysentery, no altitude sickness. We attribute our healthy trek from start to finish to our amazing guide, Giri (Dev Raj Giri). Giri, a very experienced guide, took extreme care to make sure that we were staying hydrated, eating properly (he insisted that we eat 3 meals a day even when we felt too tired to eat), recommending which foods to avoid at which lodging and lunch locations, and showing great sensitivity at handling our occasional headache. One of our group had a bout of tummy trouble at the beginning of our long day to reach EBC, and Giri worked with her, supporting her, and ensured that she healthily and successfully reached base camp. He is well-known to other guides and tea house/lodging staff, giving us added assurance that we were in the best of hands. He let us use his phone to call loved ones at home (US), too--eliminating the need for a SIM card or relying on the iffy wifi that was avaialble at some of the higher altitude inns. Jiri, our assistant guide, was a quiet and calming influence on our group, sometimes leading, often 'bringing up the rear' to complete the team effort. We saw beautiful vistas, amazing sights (an avalance in the disstance, yak 'trains' moving across thin trails, monks chanting at Tembouche Monastery). While we worked strenously to complete our trek, our guide's guidance and his uncanny ability to know what we needed (words of encouragement, assistance with carrying our daypacks, a Snickers bar when energy was failing) ensured that we completed the trek on time and safely.  We talked with many other trekkers during our trek and we were the only group that experienced no ill effects (tummy trouble, altitude sickness). We attribute it to the care and intelligent way that Himalayan Glacier operates--seasoned guides, known lodges, perfect pacing."

While we met many people on the trail that didn't have a guide, I am incredibly satisfied with our choice to hire a guide - the information and ease of travel they are able to provide is invaluable and for a first time trek in Nepal we saw it as money well spent. I was so impressed when Narayan checked in on us throughout our trek to ensure everything was going well. I would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier Trekking, they treat their staff incredibly well and provide their customers with top level service! Note: If you plan on doing the Annapurna Circuit, try to go to Tilicho Lake if it is safe to cross and you feel comfortable crossing the rock slide. It made crossing the pass so much easier since we were able to acclimatize with the few extra days. Also try to trek the whole circuit if you have the time. Tourism has declined in some of the lower elevation villages with the construction of the road and they could really use the business!"

We organized the tour once we arrived in Kathmandu by talking to Naba, who gave us some great advice and catered the trip according to our time constraints and what we were interested in. There was only 2 of us and we had Babu as our guide. Babu is a top guide but because there were so few tourists in Nepal when we visited he was happy to work as our guide/porter - which meant he carried one of our bags and while still being an excellent guide. We really found our experience with Babu amazing. He enabled us to chat with all the locals we met along with way and gave us some good information about the area. He was also really easy to get along with, very friendly and looked out for our needs (and seemed very responsible and capable). You don't need a guide to do the Annapurna circuit (and this is the first time I have ever used a guide, and I do a lot of trekking) but I think the experience we gained with Babu was definitely worth it. I would also strongly suggest now is a great time to visit Nepal as there are so few tourists (and they are in need for tourists!). The Annapurna Circuit has a reputation for being so busy but when we went in December, the combination of the season, earthquake and fuel blockade, meant we were often the only people at the teahouses! December was a great time for trekking. It was cold, but beautiful weather. Highly recommend!"

The route, far up near the border with Tibet, had been closed since the April 25 earthquake and its aftershock last year. The trek was not easy, but Himalayan Glacier stepped up and made it all run smoothly. Naba, one of the principal figures at Himalayan Glacier, met with me personally over lunch to see what my interests were. My guide, Ashish, helped me hunt for the best equipment, taking my limited budget into account. He handled all the permits and bus tickets, and was a genuine friend on the trek.Langtang itself has been hit hard by the earthquake. The aftermath is everywhere, and the entire village of Langtang is now sitting under rubble. This creates one part of the trek where it's highly advised to bring your own lunch, owing to a significant distance (6-8 hours) between meals. However, more people should really go on this trek, both to get a better sense of the devastation that has racked the country as well as help in the recovery. Every person who goes on this trek and visits Kyanjin Gumba is helping bolster the many families who are still living and working there.The view from any one of the peaks ringing Kyanjin Gumba is worth the trip, but the opportunity to help the community makes it a can't-miss. I thank Himalayan Glacier for giving me the opportunity to see this, for their unwavering support and commitment to what turned out to be an unforgettable experience."

Our own guide Rishi picked us up from the airport and the next day helped us buy all our kit on his day off. Rishi was an incredible guide, with so much experience he was full of interesting knowledge that he happily shared and some brilliant stories. Everyone knew him in the mountain and he made us feel safe and welcome everywhere we went he has definitely become a good friend we will want again when we come back. Sristi was also amazing, she recommended we didn't do the Thorong La pass due to the time of year and great advice it was as it was closed when we wouldn't of crossed. HGC are the best in the mountains."

My husband and I just had a tour with Himalayan Glacier from Kathmandu, Nepal to Tibet and we can honestly say it was an incredible experience we will remember for the rest of our lives. Himalayan Glacier staffs took great care for us the moment we landed in Kathmandu. There was a pickup ride arranged for us to the hotel and the hotel stay was superb beyond our expectations. Throughout the tour, the Executive Director (Mr. Naba) took care of us to ensure we know what to do and the detail itinerary for the entire tour in Kathmandu and Tibet. He made sure we know all areas we will face when entering Tibet such as dealing with the change in climate given that we went in January. In addition, the potential of altitude sickness for the high elevation in Tibet. Overall, we had a great experience on the tour and the staffs were extremely nice and attentive to our well beings. Prior to the tour, we were always in contact with Vidya via email and she was great and responsive to all our inquiries and concerns. She was a big help in accommodating to all our requests and we were so happy to meet her in person in Kathmandu. In addition, I lost my wedding band at the hotel and we contacted Himalayan Glacier to ask them pick it up for us. They were more than happy to pick up from the hotel and wait to deliver to us at the airport. We were truly grateful for their service as they went above and beyond our expectations. We would definitely recommend Himalayan Glacier to anyone looking for tours in Nepal, Tibet, India, and Bhutan areas as you will not be disappointed with their services."

The service provided were top notch, and we were taken care of very well throughout the whole trip. In fact, having been on many tours before, the level of service is above and beyond any other tours we have experienced. They were also very flexible with the schedule to ensure that we were happy and so that we can make the most of our time. The tour guide in Tibet was wonderful and we made a friend after the trip.I would greatly recommend this company. Especially if you are planning to go Tibet and Everest base camp, you want a company that you know and trust will take good care of you no matter what. They are also very responsive prior to the trip via email and will answer all questions you may have. So feel free to reach out to them!Thank you Himalayan Glacier! You made our trip something to remember for a lifetime."

Himalayan Glacier were an easy organisation to communicate with before and during the trip.

They also did a fantastic job of looking after us throughout the trip - airport pick ups/drop offs and taking care of us whilst hiking in the high altitudes! Our guide Suresh was lovely and it was brilliant getting to know him, as well as our assistant guide Saroj and our 2 porters Suman and Purna. They were a great team and really showed us the hospitable, friendly Nepalese culture.We booked our trip before the April earthquake and were unsure before arriving how the area had been affected. We were surprised to see that the EBC has barely been affected by the earthquake. We hardly saw any damage at all and can verify that the scenery, walking trails and accommodation are still in working order! Our only advice is to take warm clothing!!"

He also has a wonderful sense of humor and we had fun and laughed a lot! I celebrated a birthday while hiking the Everest Trail and he even managed to have a birthday cake (with candles) for me when we arrived at our lodge that evening. Our porters, Prokash and Sumon, also did an amazing job. Our bags were always waiting for us, clean and dry, at our lodge.We also spent a week in Bhutan and had a wonderful time with our guide, Sonam, and driver Sangay.

In one instance we wanted to rent a motorcycle to go around the lake in Pokhara and Rissi negotiated down to a third of the price that the vendor wanted. Rissi even purchased a muda for me when I was paragliding and I absolutely love it (I paid him back immediately, of course).

Unsure what to do, Himalayan Glacier emailed that they were resuming tours in late May. Not wanting to pass up this once in a lifetime opportunity (literally, we were both between jobs and had could spend the month travelling) we hopped on the plane and eventually landed in Kathmandu.We were the only ones that came, so it was just the two of us, our guide Tulsi, and our porter Rahm. Given the circumstances, the expertise of the entire Himalayan Glacier team was a welcome blessing. Due to risk of landslides, we changed our trek from the Everest base camp to Annapurna base camp. They made it clear that we had full control of our trek, but they acted as trusted advisers at every step. Tulsi knows all the owners of the lodges at each village and camp, and by reaching out to his network he knew exactly where we could go that would be safe, open, and good for a hot meal.Before our trek, we got a tour of some of the fantastic temples (unfortunately damaged by the earthquake) and sights of Kathmandu. Himalayan Glacier took care of the hotel (the lovely hotel Aryatara in our case), all the flights, and transportation & sightseeing. We were never left wanting, we had a driver, guides, and fantastic service at the hotel. Tulsi even took us out to the markets in Kathmandu and made sure we were properly equipped.In terms of treks, Annapurna may not have the same name appeal as Everest, but it's a beautiful region. Greener than the Everest trek, the lower altitudes are almost tropical . Plenty of wildlife, including monkeys, buffalo, ponies and burros, goats, as well as village cats and dogs. As you start to climb it gets cooler, and you have fantastic views. The ever-present landmark is Mount Machhapuchchhre (\"fishtail mountain\") names for it's unique identitiy.Stays at lodges are fun. Due to high vacancies, we typically got the best room in the house (with attached bathroom / shower). All the food is covered, and you'll be hungry. Dal Bhat is more or less the national food of Nepal, and I highly recommend it. We were coming up against the rainy season, but Tulsi was very good at getting us to the destination village before the afternoon rains. We didn't get rained on once.Due to landslide concerns, we didn't go all the way to Annapurna Base Camp (again, our choice, Tulsi was ready to take us if we desired), so we trekked around at the lower altitiudes. We ended our trek at Sarangkot, a village overlooking Pokhara. Instead of hiking back to the city, we gave all our things to Rham and Tulsi and then Parasailed down!All in all, it was an experience to last a lifetime. I can't recommend Himalayan Glacier enough, and will strive to make it back if I can ever get a month of again."

We booked the 12-days \"Experience Nepal\" tour and Himalayan Glacier provided us with a personal guided 15-days trip, customized to all our extra wishes - from the lonely trekking paths of the Annapurna Conservation Area to the crowded streets of Kathmandu Himalayan Glacier was always flexible and open to changes. Our way was very well lead by our guide Dol, who not only knew the best places to stay and visit, but also told us a lot about the people and culture of Nepal. Special thanks to Gopal, our porter, who carried our heavy backpacks and still was faster than us along the mountain paths (our hero!) - always with a smile on his face. Back in Kathmandu, Dol was so nice to accompany us in a unplanned shopping day in the city's local markets, including clothing shops, tailors, music stores - now we are totally \"nepalized\"!"

The company was very easy to work with in setting up the logistics, and our crew was terrific. Very friendly and always made sure we had what we needed. I'd love to do another trek with Hira, Padam and Bishow - can't thank these three enough for an amazing experience. We had to change our schedule in the 2nd half of the trek and it was seamless on our end; they took care of changing any lodging arrangements and worked out flight changes out of Lukla without us ever having to worry about it. They are very focused on health and safety, both for us and their crew, and they have a ton of knowledge of the mountains. It's not a cheap trip, but the value of what you're getting is well worth it (transportation in Kathmandu, flights in and out of Lukla, lodging and meals every day, and their expertise in the mountains to name a few). In terms of the Gokyo Ri trek itself, it's the most beautiful setting I've ever experienced. We did this in late march / early april and got to experience a wide variety of terrain (including snow). There are definitely some days of tough hiking in terms of climbs, but nothing technically challenging. A great trip for anyone looking for a beautiful trek."

Words cannot begin to express how I feel, and how grateful I am to the team at Himalayan Glaciers to have put together an error free and splendid trek for me along with my partners on trek ( 8th March 2015 ). the whole trek has been cast in fond memories which i shall cherish throughout and because of the trek and Himalayan Glacier have now developed a yearn to summit Sagarmatha !.Naba ( co founder and overall incharge of operations ) has put together an excellent organisation both in terms of customer delight ( not just satisfaction ) and the professional team of guides and support staff.Right from my very first interaction on email with Urusha from Himalayan Glacier i could tell by the way all my queries over the weeks were answered patiently and with all details that i had made the right choice in going with Himalayan for the trek. Urusha not just answered all my queries but was most helpful in providing various other inputs both with regards to trek and for things to do at Kathmandu.We were a group of 4 ( my Australian mate, a German and an Indian and all of us gelled and hit off the trek with fun and close bonding ) and were accompanied by Dol ( main guide ), Biru ( assistant guide ) and 2 porters ....so for the 4 trekkers we had an equal number of support staff !!!! Amazing....Dol has been the most clam and composed guide one could have asked for, his knowledge about the Himalayas, its people, the nature and the trek were beyond any fault. He took great care to ensure all our likes were catered to throughout the trek and at times he anticipated our needs in advance and had them met with in advance. Himalayan Glaciers is congratulated for having trained such exceptional staff. Biru the assistant guide, is another prized catch Himalayan Glaciers have and shall one day turn into an exceptional guide himself under Naba and Dol.We could tell from the places we stayed at and the kind of food we ate that we were \" royalty \" as we always had the best places with best rooms to stay and the food was exceptionally good ( i also made it a point to interact with chefs at all the places we stayed which meant we could all have food to our liking......).I can go on and on about the trek especially because everything was thought of and taken care by Himalayan Glaciers ( right from first interaction over emails to Welcome and farewell dinners and the trek in between...).I happen to be a very fussy person, however Himalayan Glacier have not once given me any time to complain about anything, cos there wasnt anything to complain upon....I do look forward to many more treks with them ...and congratulate the entire team on the exceptional work they all put in."

Finally to mention the special care we received from Executive Director Naba when our flight was cancelled due to unpreventable circumstances at the airport.Naba arranged for us to stay at the same hotel, he liaised with the airline and kept us informed of any progress and when we might expect to get a flight. The car and driver was available to us for the whole of the delayed period, and it seems absolutely nothing is a bother to any of the staff but quite the very opposite, they all take the greatest of pleasure in giving their utmost assistance.Himalayan Glacier certainly excelled in in everything they did for us, an excellent, professional service from beginning to end with all members of staff.

We have seen many tour guides on the way to Base Camp who would remain behind to chat with their fellow guide hence leave their clients alone in some treacherous paths, Asis would never do that. He adjusts his pace according to the clients and he would never get you out of his sight, in case something happens. Many times when I was struggling to see the next unfrozen point in the path, he would come to the rescue and made sure I would cross that bit safe and sound.

            "review": "Recommended tour group for EBC. Having completed a trek to Mt.Kilimanjaro in Feb 2014 my wife and I decided we'd give Everest Base Camp a go. In selecting a tour company we chose Himalayan Glacier based on a colleague's recommendation. We found going through the source rather than a third party who subcontract it to a local operator (as can be the case) both saved us money and gave us a greater understanding of who we were dealing with.After feeling very fortunate in having a great group in Kilimanjaro we decided we wouldn't risk the group dynamic this time and chose to take the tour as a couple. We also took the trip over the Australian summer (Jan 2015) - which is the Nepalise winter - the main benefits of which are the lack of crowds and mainly crystal clear days. We chose the 15-day luxury trek which included a day tour of Kathmandu and approx 11 days of actual trekking. Of this 5 nights were in \"luxury lodges\" hosted by Yeti Mountain Houses and 6 nights were at tea houses/lodges. The differences between the luxury lodges and guest house/tea houses was significant particularly for those who dread communal toilets, especially in the bitter cold. We would definitely choose this form of \"glamping\" again. The Kathmandu day tour was run by a very informative guide ( forget his name) but very knowledgable, good English and plenty of stats. Whilst \"temple-itis\" set in quickly, we found the day surprisingly enjoyable and a great experience of Kathmandu city. The trekking part was run by our guide Pradip and our porter Furman. Pradip was an extremely competent guide, great English skills and knowledge of the various mountains and their peak heights. He was always ready to help and make sure we were ok. Whilst I think we're pretty straight forward and low maintenance, we really couldn't ask for anymore. Our porter likewise always carried our bags with no fuss, forever with a smile and whatever English he knew and always helping out with tea and clearing plates etc.As a team both Pradip and Furman worked very well and are a credit to Himalayan Glacier. In summary the comments we make are: * Compared to Kilimanjaro we found this trek far more enjoyable. All the various villages, proper altitude acclimatisation, and being in the midst of such a landscape was amazing.  * Of the very many tour groups in Nepal, we would recommend Himalayan Glacier to anyone for professionalism and care of Trekkers as well as proper conditions for guides and porters. Personal touches by the owner to make sure things met expectations was also appreciated. * Request Pradip and Furman to be on your group if at all possible. * Whilst trekking in winter was cold towards Base Camp (around minus 10 in the tea/guest houses at night) we preferred having more of the trails and guest houses to ourselves or a few others. Of approx 39,000 who do the trek each year, around 9,000 trek in Oct, which in our view would have made the trails and guest houses/lodges way too busy and hardly enjoyable for such a serene location. However we also note that for most of the trek, when going uphill we spent a lot of time in t-shirts and lose clothing. * The luxury Yeti Lodges were well worth it - not only was the food far better, but hot showers and bathrooms to yourself and electric blankets added a little bit of comfort to what can become a little tiresome in the guest houses.* A lot of the food on the menus arrived quite differently to what you'd expect in a western country. Tolerance of understanding that this was the Nepalise version of a favourite dish goes a long way. * Avoid potatoes or anything that may of needed preserving north of Namche Bazaar. We made the fatal mistake and thereafter stuck with staples that came from a tin or was dried ( eg pasta sauce, soups, noodles, etc ). * Take plenty of layers with you clothing wise. Beware that the 15kg limit on baggage for the Lukla flight includes hand luggage otherwise you have the excess baggage charge ( about $10 for us). * A hot water bottle will get you through cold nights - alternatively having your water bottle filled up with hot water before you go to bed can help. * Last but not least, take plenty of photos and remember that even if the view of Everest is cloudy on the way up, it may still be clear on the way down.

We did a \"Nepal Adventure Trip\" with HGT in Oct/Nov 2014 which included a bit of everything: from city sightseeing to canyoning and river rafting and from a short trek in the Annapurna range to a few days in the Chitwan national park.Although we were both very hesitant of booking a complete trip beforehand, we were definitely not disappointed. Ok, we were lucky that we ended up doing the trip just with the two of us instead of a larger group but think even then - HGT would have made it a very enjoyable trip (maybe even better)...They were very attentive, informative, helpful and always there if and when we needed them. We definitely want to come back to the Himalayas soon - and we will definitely not look past HGT when booking! We highly recommend HGT to anyone."

From the moment we met our guide Tulsi, throughout our journey to Pokhara and on to trek in the Annapurna sanctuary, we were extremely well cared for and loved every moment. We visited the Peace Temple in Pokhara and the Alpine museum as well as many Buddhist temples. We witnessed the stunning sunrises over the Annapurna range and the sacred mountain named Macchapucchre, otherwise known as Fish Tail mountain, which is dedicated to the lord Shiva and may not be climbed. We trekked through rhododendron forests with monkeys cavorting in the trees above and shared the trail with donkeys carrying heavy loads as well as young children on their way to school. This was my third and my daughter's second visit to this amazing country. We cannot wait to return and to join the wonderful people at Himalayan Glacier Trekking for another adventure. Namaste, Ama and Chori."

Best of all, we were permitted to make some significant changes in our itinerary, while on the road in the kingdom of Bhutan, which really enhanced our journey, and were able to do so with no fuss or added extra costs, remarkable! Some other travelers we met along the way (with other companies), were having so so trips, while ours was superb and of quality in every way!My advise, especially in Bhutan, is to hire a private car (with driver and guide) as the roads are ridiculous. Also, spend more then one night in at least some places! Most companies seem to run you around needlessly, and exhaust one by arriving late and leaving early. Simply put, not my cup of tea!"

From being picked up at the airport in Kathmandu upon my initial arrival to being dropped off at my guest house at the end of the Tibet tour, I was very impressed with HGT. I have not participated in many guided tours of places I have visited, but would suggest HGT is the only tour company to contact if looking for tours in their region.As I was a solo traveler and was going to be on both tours by myself I did not expect such a great level of attention to detail. The guides and drivers in Bhutan and Tibet were excellent. Navigating those windy roads definitely takes a level of skill. There had been an issue with the vehicle that was to be used on the Tibet tour several hours before my arrival. This did not affect my time at all. We used taxis and public transport (at no cost to myself) for getting around Lhasa. When the time came to leave Lhasa (for the drive back to Nepal) and our vehicle wasn't available, another was provided without hesitation.Everyone who has asked me about my time in Bhutan and Tibet I have suggested they look into HGT. I am thinking about visiting Myanmar at some point in the future, if I do this as a guided tour, I will definitely be contacting HGT.Aaron Forbes"

We moved thru the deep mountain gorges. Across multiple, high suspension bridges, thru villages and along mountain trails where nothing moves unless someone carries it, from heavy stoves for the tea houses to the 4x4 beams to build houses. The constant sound of rushing, milky colored water, hundreds of feet below us was a constant reminder of the magnitude of the countryside. The mountains appeared and disappeared in the high mist, but are overwhelming when fully revealed. The resonant chanting of the Buddhist monks will remain with me forever as will the lone Yak bells along the trails. Himalayan Glacier is a first class organization from start to finish. The guide, Bimal Thapa was simply outstanding. When I needed special treatment for an injury the entire Himalayan Glacier team made sure everything I required was provided for and personally made sure I was taken care of. I will go again without a doubt. But the besides the incredible scenery the personal care show for me will remain with me always."

I have the utmost confidence that every detail will be considered and that delivery will be flawless. Every journey we have done with HGT has been planned exhaustively over many months. Every email is responded to promptly (generally within 24 hours). We travel as a family of five, as our own group, on itineraries that have been custom-designed by Naba. For the earliest trips our children were teenagers; now they are young adults. I have enthusiastically recommended HGT to others and look forward to continuing a long relationship with them as we continue to explore the South Asia region."

At each stop of the journey, he phoned our guides to make sure we were all well.The guides in each location were also fantastic. Sherab in Bhutan, Tenzing Norbu in Tibet, and Buddhi in Katmandu allowed us to set the pace while they provided all the commentary/explanation we could have ever hoped for. In every city, transportation arrangements were flawless. We were never \"worried\" about anything.We have travelled to many parts of the world (all 7 continents), and the service we received from Himilayan Glacier has been \"as good as it gets\". We will surely recommend them to friends and family and will definitely use them again on our next trip to the region.Naba Skype-d with us before and after the trip - before to make sure everything was set and after to make sure we had a good experience. We have nothing but the best to say of him and his organization!"

I have nothing but positive things to say about the overall effeciency of the trek, planning, guide (Giri),porters and accomodations. Himalayan has obviously done this trek numerous times and the guides/porters were well known to the locals which was a considerable advantage when accomodations are somewhat scarce. I would have no hesitations in recommending them for this, or any other trek/sightseeing. After this trek, I used them for a sightseeing tour of Kathmandu which was equally as efficient and plan on returning to complete the Mt. Kailas trek in 2015 using them also."

They organised everything perfectly and combined the two trips into one making the whole experience seamless and enjoyable.The guides were fantastic, and even though one of our connecting flights was cancelled due to bad weather, Himalayan Glacier refunded the costs of the flights to us in cash before heading back home - no issues whatsoever.The guides went above and beyond - and during the 11 day trek to the base camp of Annapurna our guide went so far as to provide us with fresh fruit with every meal - something no other guide did and something he did out of his own pocket - really amazing. If you are looking for an experience that delivers above and beyond all your expectations I couldn't more highly recommend Himalayan Glacier."

Doing such a long trip over nine days required an experienced and efficient tour company and Himalayan Glacier delivered on all counts. Things can go terribly wrong travelling 1000 km at such high altitudes so we wanted a knowledgeable person to plan the itinerary and arrange the logistics of passing from Nepal to China and then back to Nepal without any hassles. We found him in Mr. Naba of HGT. The whole trip was executed like a dream. He took care to arrange for us to acclimatise ourselves properly in Lhasa before setting out for higher terrain. A master visa for all twelve of us made immigration checks a breeze. The Tibetan guide was superb. Fluent in English and thoroughly professional. The driver was very skillful and he needed to be since our vehicle was travelling along winding mountain roads. Sure, some of us still experienced some AMS symptoms but we were prepared with medication and oxygen. And sure the road to EBC was torturous to say the least, but this is an adventure trip as Mr. Naba himself told us in his earlier briefing. So we were prepared to take the bad with the good. And it was good!It was exhilarating taking in the mountains and lakes, experiencing a snowfall and visiting the ancient monasteries. Not your run-of-the-mill type of holiday definitely. Thank you HGT!"

I researched several companies, including many American ones, and decided upon HGT. I went by myself and met my group there, so I have to admit I was a bit hesitant and wondering if the company would pull through! Everything was done online. My contact person was Sristi and she answered my many questions very promptly. When I landed in Kathmandu my guide Suresh was there to meet me, with a lei! I was taken to the hotel (Shanker) and got settled in after being up for 40 hours! We had a welcome dinner, a tour of Kathmandu, and everything was included! We flew to Lukla and luckily had no flight issues! Our tour included the Gokyo Lakes. I was SO glad I booked this trip vs. just going to EBC and back. Our tour breaks off from the mainstream for several days. We saw so much more, it was cleaner, a lot less crowded... Beautiful! Challenging due to Gokyo Ri and the Cho La Pass, but SO worth it!! Gokyo was my favorite part of the trip. EBC was just a bonus! HGT took care of everything! I only really had to pay for tips, 1 shower, battery charging, wifi, and souvenirs!! Our guides were all great: Suresh, Uttar, and Jungbu. Uttar and Jungbu were younger and played cards with us and were very personable. They called me \"didi\", big sister. Kinda miss it! The porters were also fantastic and worked their butts off! We also had afternoon tea every day complete with \"bickies\" (cookies), and fresh cut apples after every dinner! I would highly recommend HGT. Every detail was taken care of from airport transport, to meals, to rooms,... EVERYTHING! I truly can't recommend them highly enough! There are no HGT day trips to the Himalayas, so I snuck this in under a day trip they do offer! I hope those interested find it and read it! What an awesome, epic trip!!"

The guide and driver greeted us at the Kathmandu airport and escorted us to the office where they briefed us on the trip, and gave us the sleeping bag, down jacket, blue HG bag and blue HG tshirt. We then had dinner back at our Shanker Hotel which was had good food. Four star hotel which was acceptable according to our standards. We still purified the water with steri-pen even though it purified bottled water. We always used the steri-pen for the trip and never had any gastrointestinal issues. Our guide was Bimal and he was top notch. He was polite, professional, quiet at times, but strong with his recommendations to keep us safe and healthy. For example, he explained that meat should not be eaten above Namche Bazaar. He would check for any symptoms of altitude sickness and had an emergency first aid kit on hand with medications commonly used to treat altitude sickness including Diamox and Ibuprofen. He was well versed in the culture and mountain environment based on his substantial experience leading trekking tours over the past 10+ years with over 50 trips under his belt. After the trip was over and we were back in Kathmandu, he took my wife and I out to the Thamel streets for shopping. We became friends and exchanged contact information at the end of the trip. He was genuine and sincere, as evidenced by the fact that he was constantly approached by other guides from HG or other companies who wanted to greet him. That speaks volumes of his character that everyone knew him and was friendly to him on the trail. That gave us confidence to trust him with his decision making and recommendation. Our porter was Bikram and he did an excellent job carrying our bags over the mountain terrain. He was always courteous, on time, and delivered our bags before we even reached our destination. On the second to last day with him in Namche Bazaar the four of us played a few rounds of pool together. On the last trekking in Lukla, we took him and the guide out to dinner to say farewell to Bikram. He deserved the recognition after doing an excellent job over the long hard work. The trekking experience was more difficult than we initially imagined primarily due to the altitude related issues such as the cold temperature and 50% oxygen relative to sea level when we were 5500meters above sea level. Fortunately, we acclimatized by gradually ascending, and took a rested in Namche. The itinerary was \u201crapid\u201d in part to the rapid descent. Our legs were sore by the end. I would recommend this trip only for those who are physically fit otherwise it may be difficult to enjoy the beautiful surroundings if you are having problems with leg pain from the moderate to hard trekking."

Though we were travelling alone, we always felt safe and in competent hands.The highlights of our trip included visiting the temples in Durbar Square where we were honored to see the current Kumari goddess; the colorful Monkey Temple; Pashaputinath with its heartrending funeral ghats and the unforgettable Tibetan Buddhist Boudhanath Stupa with its wise Buddha eyes looking down at us while monks and devotees walked around its periphery. We also visited Tibetan carpet weaving studios as well as the famous Rum Doodle Restaurant with signatures and photographs of the world's most renowned mountaineers adorning its walls. These include a photo of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, prominently displayed, who in 1953 was the first Nepali to climb Mt.

The trip we made was in Langtang, it was designed on my request, and there's no need to say how beautiful it is there) I'm a person difficult to surprize, I have an outdoor experience and used to do everything myself, but even for me the help of Hari and his team was essential. For the begginers it would be an absolute must.I want also to emphasis that Mr. Harikrishna is an active member of his community. He is well-known in a neighborhood for a very important reason- he runs a lot of charity projects for people living next to him. He has build a big modern hospital near his home village Jibjibe in Langtang, and at the moment he's going through the paper legalization process for school building in the area. In his plans are 3 schools to build this year and he hopes to increase this number next year. He also supports many poor families around by paying the education fees for their kids in order to let the kids study and get a chance for a better life and future of next generation. Most of the guides working in his company where educated and trained at his cost for the same reason - to give the countryside people a chance for a better life. All the money Harikrishna spends on his projects are earned by his company tour services or donated later on by his grateful customers. Don't let go of an opportunity to become one of them!"

I have no words to describe the high level of organization and time scheduling of this agency. Margherita and I are two young and sportive students which knew very little on how to organize a trek. Luckily we found High Himalayan Trekking and Expedition on Lonely Planet and from there we connected with Harikrishna, founder of the company, which made our lives easier and set everyone up for us. He and his stuff took care of us, and we did not have to worry about anything.We are very grateful to them and I totally recommend it to families, couples, and friends."

I did bond with locals, have amazing photos around our journey. Although Hari is not my guide at that time, but he was looking for us time to time. He will make sure that everything is ok for us. The trek is so cultural and beautiful scenic view, from the deepest gorge of the world Kali Gandaki River to High Peak Snow Covered Mountain. I remember Hari always said this is an easy Trek, the trek is flat, from young to olderly also can do it. And i know what is Nepali's flat now, yes, little bit up, little bit down. Thanks Hari, you made a very wonderful trip for us, so many lessons i got while i was there."

The scenery is mindblowing amazing, from turquoise rivers, to scented pine forests, to the snow capped peaks of the Himalya\u2019s to finally the almighty giant of this world - Everest. The journey was such smooth sailing the whole time. No matter the weight they carried the Porters always had an amazing smile that could make anyone smile. I\u2019ve never felt so at peace and harmony with life until this trek. It really is a must do for everyone. No matter your age young or old anyone can do it; just \u2018Slowly Slowly\u2019 . The tea houses are great and there is always plenty of food to choose from. Finally though none of this wouldn\u2019t have been such smooth sailing without the guide with the biggest heart for nature, trekking, and NGO work - Hari. Hari you truelly are amazing,! You looked after the group amazingly and bent over backwards for them, always putting the client first. Whether you are seasoned traveIler or a little worried of what Nepal is like \u2013 Hari will guide you through everything and make you feel safe as can be.

Hari met us in airport (we are acquainted in 2011) and passed us to the hotel. He gave us a wonderful porter Sagar and organized both trips. During trekking we had no problems even if I change the itinerary. While returning from Langtang to Katmandu by jeep we faced the earthquake. You can imagine: everything is closed in KTM, nothing to eat and nowhere to live. Hari met us and invited to live in his rented house, he gave us mattresses and pillows, and we spent this funny aftershock night with him. His young sister cooked some meal for us next day. We spent one more night, and only when we took taxi to airport, Hari led us and started to his village to see what happened with his house. I think it was a real MAN act.

Through his associative activities, Hari found the perfect project for us and we could even distribute the clothes ourselves in the remote school. Before heading to the trek, we spent 5 days in Hari\u2019s village where Hari's family hosted us. Seeing how people work and live in this region was a fantastic and humbling experience. We then started the trek directly from the village.During the Trek, along with his expert guide input, Hari lead us to the best accommodations around. Since Hari is also teaching economics in Kathmandu University we could discuss broader topics such as the Nepali economy and the best ways for Nepal to improve its system. Finally meeting Hari was one of the highlights of my trip to Nepal."

Many friends who had been to Nepal had their own recommendations but when I contacted Hari the director of this company, with a rather specific request to do a not too tiresome trek, visit remote villages, and have a lot time for some meditation and writing, he came back to me with a variety of very appealing packages. Of the choices I decided to volunteer along with a group of French osteopaths and Doctors, and had the very easy job of helping out with the intake of patients for a couple of hours, with plenty of spare time to go off on my own, smoke the local ganja that grew everywhere, read, write, meditate and do yoga. It was an amazing soulful time I had, spending a couple of days at a time in these remote villages, near the Tibetan border.The biggest surprise of all though was just how good the meals were that we received. Each meal was delicious and plentiful. We ate like kings. I hadn't expected that. The company also assisted me purchase art in Kathmandu, and organised a guide (a really sweet college student) for next to nothing, to keep me company while shopping, exploring, eating out around Kathmandu, after mtg journey was done. I saw that Hari is one really well-connected guy in Nepal. He knows everyone!When I now consider the low cost of this incredible trek, I can't think of where else I've found such value for money. I will be back to Nepal again sometime, and Ill have High HimalayanTrekking design another choose-your-own adventure for me again."

Despite the rough monsoon (I suck at picking the right travel season), sneaky bloodsucking leeches, and me being extremely unfit and clumsy, I had the best time trekking with Hari in Langtang. It was my solo trip, I knew close to nothing about Nepal, have never been on a long trek before, and generally felt that it's gonna be an adventure. We stayed with local families in the mountain huts, ate amazing pancakes, and I even got used to the mind-blowing Mustang coffee (stuff with rum - a must-try). We haven't encountered a yeti, so I cannot confirm or deny its existence, but we did reach a Tibetan village at the end of the trek and watched colourful celebration of a local holiday, and even drank wine (they poured it right into my hands!).Fantastic guiding, interesting stories, great memories!"

Hari, the local porters and kitchen guys (best food you could imagine!) were so friendly, well organized, always smiling and real trekking experts.Trekking with High Himalayan Expedition is not like tours with other guides, its much more like travelling with friends and not just a guided tour. They have a huge knowledge about country and rural regions, the porters are choosen regarding the visited area. So we were allowed to get in contact with the locals (friends and family of the Hari & the local group members) and made some outstanding experiences, something you probably can\u00b4t make with other trekking companies.Choose High Himalayan Expedition, you won\u00b4t regret it :)"

Although we went during the rainy season, we were able to see the amazing mountains and were not so much affected by the weather. Our guide was very friendly: we even played cards altogether! Moreover, the fact that the High Himalayan Trekking Company is linked to a charity association (High Himalayan Community Project Nepal) gives an additional motivation to choose this Trekking Company! I highly recommand it and really enjoyed my time in Nepal through their organisation."

Hari was very accommodating in organising ways to visit local schools and sponsor families. Everything was possible and nothing was a problem to Hari. Hari is an incredible knowledgabe and passionate man and provided us with great insight into the history, culture, people and government of Nepal which was very intriguing.

The scenery is incredible. Be aware that accommodation is very basic ( bathroom and toilet especially) so you should be ready for it. You are also very likely to spend the night before the pass in a tent at 4400m as there almost no rooms there. It adds so fun memories to your trip but pack some warm clothes!Finally keshab, our guide , Prakash, yadop and bassu were an amazing crew taking great care of our safety and needs at all Times.

He was very patient, answering our hundred and one questions via email while we were working on our itinerary. We had planned to trek to Jomsom and fly to Pokhara, but upon hearing of a recent plane crash on that route Chhatra contacted us and suggested some alternatives, which was much appreciated. Having not been trekking at altitude before we selected to trek with a guide and porter. Our porter, Bishnu, was excellent. Our guide, Tshering, was very experienced. He knew the route very well and pointed out landmarks, some local history and the names of the mountain peaks as we trekked along. Both Bishnu and Tshering were courteous, never making us feel rushed and making sure they never lost sight of us or left us behind, particularly when we got higher in altitude. After having planned an itinerary with Chhatra, Tshering made changes from the outset without discussing the changes with us. As it turns out, this allowed us additional time at the end in Pokhara (and we really liked Pokhara), but we would've preferred to have a discussion about the changes first. Not all of the guesthouses we stayed in were ones we would've selected for ourselves, so if we come back to Nepal we would agree with the guide/company to select our own guesthouses along the way. Annapurna is an excellent trek; we would definitely recommend it and would recommend Nepal Eco Adventure."

So I decided to boot the Everest Base Camp Trek + Island Peak, which was a really good decision!Everything was arranged perfectly: the airport pickup, the Kathmandu sightseeing tour, the trek to Everest base camp, and the climb to Island peak. The trek to EBC was absolutely amazing. We had the best guide: Keshab. A great, knowledgeable local guide, always happy to help. Also we had two great porters: Bishnu and Santa, very strong guys. The trek is demanding (but very doable with some mountain experience) but really beautiful, great views!! Very nice lodges, especially the small ones owned by local family. And surprisingly good food, just make sure to be a vegetarian during the trek for safety reasons ;)The climb to Island Peak was really an unforgettable experience. Camping close to a glacier lake surrounded by beautiful mountains. Crazy mountain chickens. And a very, very demanding climb to the top. If you want it bad enough you can make it. What an astonishing view from the top. After the trek chhatra helped us to plan the rest of our trip to Pokhara, kayaking and Chitwan NP. We really had a great time in Nepal.I absolutely recommend this company! You will be assured of great service and an excellent Nepal experience!!"

I have lived at sea level (Florida, USA) for the past decade and in no way trained for this experience. But it's Nepal and trekking is pretty much the top tourist magnet here. Turns out, it's totally worth the hype.This was my first visit to Nepal and a visa was pretty easy to get on arrival. Tourism is their biggest industry and it\u2019s down significantly after the earthquake so I highly recommend a visit. Normally I travel independently but I was glad I booked my trek with Chhatra & Nepal Eco Adventure (instead of trekking solo) because all the transportation and trekking permits were included. Pro tip: Bring several extra passport photos with you for the permits! That being said, the trips aren\u2019t 100% all inclusive. You\u2019ll need some money for souvenirs, meals in the cities and to tip your guide and porter and the end of your trek. The 10-day Annapurna Circuit trekking trip I enjoyed during March 2016 actually included a tour of Kathmandu beforehand which happened to be during the annual Holi Festival so it was an extra treat! All of the accommodations were clean and comfortable. You will also have a few nights in Pokhara, which is a beautiful little lakeside town with all the comforts of home to enjoy before and after your trek. Obviously the rooms are a little more rustic once you get on the trail, but they all had solar-powered hot showers and hot food. I am a solo female traveler but was glad to be grouped with fellow trekkers Julienne from Canada, Deepak from Singapore and our guides Kumar and Babu. This wasn\u2019t due to safety - I felt totally safe during my almost month total travels in Nepal - it is more the social aspect and having a few others to share this incredible experience with. D and I also shared a porter named Subus. (A porter carries your bag for you.) Everyone was so friendly and helpful and Kumar and Babu even prepared fresh fruit for us every night as an extra treat! The weather was amazing but the temperature obviously gets cooler the higher you hike so you make sure you have layers. I recommend packing as light as possible. You really don\u2019t need much: two changes of clothes plus an under-layer, hiking books plus one pair of sandals/shower shoes, scarf, hat, sunglasses and small, basic toiletries. Electricity and wifi can be spotty so just bring one electronic necessity like a smartphone or a camera. Pro tip: If you forget mittens or gloves like I did, just use an extra pair of socks!"

They took into account days where we weren't feeling our best due to the altitude or various reasons and planned our trip out such that we would not miss anything. Chhatra was extremely efficient in organizing everything from our arrival at Kathmandu to flights to-from pokkahara as well as the major part of the trip which was our Mustang trek. Since I was not in my best shape possible and found myself straggling at end of the trekking party most of the time, there was always one guide beside me to assess if I needed help and to encourage me to push on. The overwhelming sense of satisfaction I achieved when I completed the trek can be attributed to them. Overall this was a life-changing experience and I'll definitely be back."

We had two porters -Omit and Poti (sorry for the probably wrong writing) on 5 people and one guide - Shiva. They all were friendly with us and helpful. Especially I would like to thank Poti, who was very responsive and kind, great person! Shiva was ready to answer the questions about current place, culture and nature and was very polite. Our group was very diverse in a sense of physical training, mountaineering experience and age, but the Eco team found good approach. Also we had never lost the way. We think that our driver - Shreehari was the best driver in Nepal, many thanks to him one more time. After the trekking we had an excursion to the Kathmandu valley (Heritage tour). Our guide had a deep knowledge about the area and good English, showed a lot of amazing places. All team members were in time and picked us up directly at the hotel. Many thanks to all of you Nepal Eco Adventure members!'-': After the trip guys, who helped with rucksacks, were very disappointed about received tips, it was about 35 $ per person for 10 days. We paid to the company good money and were sure that guys have good salary. It was not a big pleasure to have such reaction taking into account that for us the price tour was not an easy weight. It seems that their salary is very small even in such company. Before the trip we talked with Chhatra about two peaks on a way: Tsergo Ri and Surya peaks. They both do not have technical difficulties. And our guide was aimed to show the way. With Tsergo Ri all was ok, however when we came to second one, Shiva did not know the way, which is of course can be, but he did not ask local people about the best route (there are several). After our question he talked with a men in our tea house and suggested one rout in an abstract manner. But he said that he will not go, because it is quite dangerous and did not recommend us to do it either, but this men can show the way for 10000 NPR. For my parents we ordered before the trekking trip to Nagarkot. In the end of the dry season there is zero visibility on the top of the hill, it is better to know this in advance."

I was visiting Nepal for only six days and for such a short period of time, Chhatra was able to arrange domestic flights, a customized Everest View Hike, and full accommodations. He was also kind enough to set me up on a full tour of Kathmandu with an excellent guide! I planning on going back for an EBC Base Camp trek and will definitely be calling Chhatra again."

Although, July is rainy season in Nepal, I decided to make the best of it and contacted Chhatra to get a trekk organized for me. Chhatra answered all my emails, which where both many and detailed, without any delay and within a few days he had a 9 days trekk to Annapurna Base Camp organized for me. Many thanks for all your help Chhatra! July is not a good month for trekking with all the rain and I was prepared for the worst. However, I got surprisingly many days with sunshine and good visibility. As well as a morning in the base camp when the clouds lifted from the mountains and the beautiful Annapurna was revealed to me. Having a porter and guide was really excellent. Especially since my guide, Bijayrah Karki, was very knowledgeable about birds and we had many excellent bird sightings. Definitely a good idea to have a guide with an interest that is interesting to talk about when walking through the forests up to higher ground. When returning to Kathmandu, I also got a very interesting cultural tourist tour of Kathmandu with Raju Suwal and I was amazed with his detailed knowledge about Kathmandu. One item to keep in mind when organizing a trip like this, I took the 7,5 hours bus between Pokhara and Kathmandu after returning from the trekk. Although, the scenery is great, 7,5 hours is a very long trip on bad roads. Next time I will pay the extra to fly home to Kathmandu rather than taking the bus. To sum up, a surprisingly good trekk despite being rainy season and a very well organized tour by Eco Adventure. Many thanks to you all at Nepal Eco!"

Price was budget friendly compared to other tour companies and we seemed to get just about everything that other companies provided to their groups staying at the same locations.

This was BY FAR the most fulfilling trip of my life, and I am so very thankful I chose Nepal Eco Adventure to help get me there. I admit there was a lot of anxiety about the trip before making the 8,000 mile journey to Kathmandu but whatever worries and concerns I had were quickly diminished after dealing with both the tour operator, Chhatra, and then with my Guide Bijay.  To start with, my flight was cancelled the day of to Abu Dhabi and the next wasn't available until 3 days later. I was so stressed that I was going to have to find a new guide company but Chhatra replied to my email immediately saying that he took care of it and rescheduled my trip AT NO EXTRA CHARGE! That includes my ticket from Kathmandu to Lukla, my guide who was to meet me in the city, as well as any lodging issues.  When I finally made it to Kathmandu I was introduced to my guide. I was honestly a little nervous about this as well, seeing as how I was gonna be spending day and night travelling with this person for two and a half weeks, but we got on great! Bijay was attentive, knowledgeable, and always carried a warm personality even when I was ill with altitude sickness. He made sure to get me a bed in the nicest lodges available and had fresh fruit every evening to go with my dinner. My oxygen levels were checked twice a day and we walked at MY pace, which made a big difference.  If you want to have the greatest adventure of your life, going in with confidence that you will be taken care of the entire way with a very professional company then I can't reccomend Nepal Eco Adventure enough!!!!! Have fun, and ask for Bijay!!!"

I spent close to 40 days in Nepal in April/May of 2016. I booked solo and met fantastic people in my hiking group and while hiking. Both the Annapurna Circuit and EBC/Chola/Gokyo are beautiful in their own way. I highly recommend doing both treks if it is your first time in Nepal. Chhatra is super organized and everything was taken care of. The lodges we stayed at were fine - no thrills but none needed - you're in the mountains in the Himalayan range which is all you can ask for. Our guide was great - Narayen. He knew all the ins and outs. The only snag we unfortunately ran into was in Lukla on our way back to Kathmandu at the end of the trip - but most of that was due to unfavorable weather, causing us to spend an extra 2 days in Lukla trying to catch a flight out. Perhaps more attention could have been given here to prioritize us on a flight out but it is what it is, no biggie. All in all, my experience in Nepal and with Eco Adventure was excellent. Please don't take high elevation lightly - make sure you've tested your body with previous high altitude hikes/climbs - just a general statement. Nepal is a beautiful nation and the people in the countryside are genuine and goodhearted."

As part of a group trek, I did the Everest Base Camp & 3 Passes (Kongma La, Cho La, Renjo La) trek with Nepal Eco Adventure this Apr 2016, spanning around 3 weeks. This was a challenging and strenuous high altitude trek with all 3 passes above 18,000 ft, EBC at 17,500 ft and Kala Patthar at 18,500 ft. Chhatra Karki, who runs Nepal Eco, carried out the entire planning and logistics for this trek. Chhatra is extremely knowledgeable about the routes on this trek and was very responsive, detailed, helpful and flexible right from the first interaction we had till much after completing the trek. The trek guides and porters he provided were strong & competent, had a focus on safety, were polite and helpful and most of them had prior experience trekking these routes. Boarding, lodging and food was excellent throughout the trek relative to the tea house facilities available on these routes. Chhatra\u2019s information and advice around weather conditions, altitude sickness, safety, health, water & food aspects were very useful. Later during the trek as we improvised on the itinerary to save time, Chhatra responded flexibly (and patiently), at short notice, in re-booking flights, boarding & lodging to accommodate our changes. The trek in itself, for the most part, comprised of long 5-8 hour walks over 15000 ft, through steep inclines, snowy & icy paths, huge glaciers, moraine, scree and pretty cold conditions. These challenges, however, were well rewarded with magnificent views of the highest Himalayan ranges, stunning landscapes, mesmerizing alpine lakes, unique flora & fauna, serene monasteries, beautiful countryside, great food and lovely local people. All in all a truly memorable trek! As regards areas for improvement, some of the trek guides could develop deeper knowledge about the culture and history of the local places and people on these routes that would add to enriching the overall experience. Kumar Jirel, one of the trekking guides, while competent, could develop a bit more empathy for client trekkers not as experienced. As a disclaimer, I am not affiliated in any way or work for Nepal Eco nor do I write too many reviews. But, that said, I would have no hesitation in trekking again with Nepal Eco and would recommend them for those looking to trek in Nepal."

Last spring I did a 18 days trek in Sagarmatha National Park with my husband (30 years old) and my parents (58 and 65) - my best trekking experience ever! I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure and this trek, a beautiful and challenging one called the Three High Passes Trek. This was my second time in Nepal. The first time I was with another trekking company and Nepal Eco Adventure was definitely much better although the trek costed exactly the same price. Before the trek, Chhatra was very helpful and responsive, he gave us great advice to help us choose the trek and the equipment. Then he took care of everything very efficiently for us, including the trek permit and the hotel reservation in Kathmandu where he made sure we had the best rooms. The trek was wonderful, beautiful landscapes and people and excellent accomodation. Many of the owners of the lodges were good friends of our guide so there was also a nice and fun atmosphere. Our guide Rajesh was very friendly but also serious and responsible and he knew everything about the area. He spoke excellent English and some French too :) He told us a lot of interesting stories and we learned a lot about the Sherpa culture and Nepal in general thanks to him. Our porters, Man and Chhitra, were incredibly nice, friendly and helpful, they understood English well and we had an excellent time with them. Rajesh was very flexible and clever. When we arrived at EBC, my parents were very tired, they found the trek too challenging, had altitude sickness and didn't feel like crossing the remaining high passes. Instead of having the four of us go down together, Rajesh proposed an alternative that suited everyone: my parents went down with one of the porters while my husband and I continued and did the whole trek. The four of us were extremely pleased with our experience and if we come back to Nepal for a trek we will definitely choose Nepal Eco Adventure again."

Chhatra was very patient and offered a lot of good advice and assistance in helping us achieve this dream. He was always quick to reply our emails/questions, and always polite and courteous. His staff are also all very professional and friendly. We had Rajesh as our guide. He was very attentive to our needs and our health during the trek, always making sure we stay hydrated and keeping an eye on how altitude affected us. We were a bit slower on the trek, but Rajesh was very patient the whole way. We met quite a few other trekkers on this trip, and I really can't say the same about other trekking companies. We met guides who argued with their clients. There were also guides from other companies who drank too much off duty. My advice is be careful who you hire, and really consider Nepal Eco Adventures to make sure your holiday is safe and enjoyable. I don't work for Nepal Eco Adventures. I don't get commission from them. I am just another tourist from Canada. I don't write too many reviews but this awesome company really deserves a mention."

My husband did the Everest base camp trek last year and thought that it would be a good idea for us to do the upper mustang trek together. We did have our apprehensions but decided to just do it. We met part of our team in Kathmandu upon arrival at the airport and the others at Chattra's office and I felt like I could trust and connect with them almost immediately. After enjoying the chaos of Kathmandu and the calmness of Pokkhara, we took our flight up to Jomsom together with our guides Shiva and Narayan. We met our horseman Binod and his 2 horses. We rented 2 horses for the kids in case they got tired of walking. But I ended up riding the horse whenever I had a chance as it was so enjoyable. We also met our third guide Nikhil and our porter Munggal. Philipp our 8 year old decided that he was not comfortable on the horse on the first trekking day and Nikhil constructed a seat out of wood and cushion and piggy backed him through the mountains. They were inseparable after the second day.Narayan and Shiva were both great guides as they had different strengths. And we all got along well. Narayan had been on this trail often and he knew the trail inside out and shared stories about what the trail was like when it first opened up to tourists in 1992. Shiva shared lots of insights into the Nepalese culture and the current situation of the country after last year's earthquake. Although at certain points, we all experienced a certain degree of altitude sickness, were cold, got sick and were living outside of our comfort zone, we had full confidence in our team. The team was fun, my kids were happy, the adults were happy, the Dahl baht was good, my kids ate well, and the scenery was just amazing. We stopped at various tea houses and met strong resilient people who smiled a lot. I am humbled by our adventure and have a deep respect for the resilience of the people that we met in Nepal. Maybe we'll have another Himalayan adventure next year :)"

Our guides were brilliant, knowledgeable and made sure we were ok!"

            "review": "Everest Base Camp amd Chola Pass with Nepal Eco Adventure. I have trekked with Nepal Eco Adventure in April 2016. I was a bit nervous to embark on my journey as I never trekked before and it was my first time in Nepal, however Nepal Eco Adventure made me feel welcome and answered all my questions. Before arriving to Nepal I had several questions about the adventure, things to brings and what to expect. I contacted the company several times and got responses right away ( within 1or 2 hours) to all my questions. Chattra was very helpful and made me feel right away at ease.Once I arrived to Nepal everything was well organized and went according to the schedule. We (my father and I) were greeted by our guide and transported to our hotel with explanations of what will happen the following day ( city tour and meeting at the agency to have an overview of our trip).The following day as planned we had our city tour, with beautiful sightseeing and explanations about the local culture, customs and life style. Later that day we were brought to the office to pick up equipment that we needed ( sleeping bag, trekking poles) . We also met our guide who explained to us what to pack with us and how next day will go ( flying to Lukla).Next day we were transported to the airport and since we had an early flight that was booked by Nepal Eco Adventure we were able to fly to Lukla within 1hr of arrival to airport. Once in Lukla our trekking began with beautiful scenery surrounding us. Our trek included Everest Base Camp and then Chola Pass and Gokyo Ri. Throughout the journey we received many explanations about what we were seeing and where we were going from our guide. Our oxygen level was measured every evening which was very helpful and just re-confirming that we were all in good shape to continue our trekking. The acclimatization days were also very helpful to adjust to high elevations.Overall the trekking was absolutely amazing, we met interesting people, saw beautiful scenery and had personal experiences that I won\u2019t forget.Once we arrived back to Katmandu we met again Chattra from Nepal Eco Adventure who asked us how our trip went. We can feel and I know he really cares about our experience and works hard to ensure that we have a great trip not only trekking but also once we are back to the city. We spend 2 days in the city upon which the company arranged airport pick up for us and we were transported to catch our plane and be back to the reality as Nepal seemed an absolute dream!!!! I strongly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to anyone who is planning a trekking trip to Nepal. They have deliver on their service, attention and care!Thank you!!!!!I will be back, Nepal!!!"

            "review": "Everest base camp trek. I decided that the Everest base camp trek was to be my challenge for 2016- to help ease me into turning 30 :)So early last year I started googling different tour agencies and that's when I came across Nepal Eco adventure. after a quick look on trip advisor at the reviews I decided to send my prilimarily email. Chhattra was fantastic, all my queries, worries and general questions (there were a lot of them) were answered in a timely manner and much faster than I could have hoped for. For a solo female traveller this was enough to put my mind at ease and have trust that this company would look after my best interests. I didn't even bother to contact any other companies- it was decided that Nepal Eco adventure was whom I would travel with and I wasn't disappointed. I landed in Kathmandu on the 14/05/16 greeted at the airport by Ram and taken to the Nepal Access Hotel.I then went to meet chhattra, the team, paid my deposit and had a briefing on what to expect whilst trekking, which would commence on the 16/05/16On the 15/05/16 we had a guided tour of Kathmandu which was excellent and a great way to get to know the group of people I was trekking with.The 16th arrived and so did the dreaded flight to Lukla (actually it wasn't too bad- Goma air has nice new planes) to begin our 12 days of walking... Every day was absolutely fantastic! our lead guide Ram was extremely knowledgeable, kind and supportive. He made sure we were all ok and tailored each day to meet all of our needs at a pace that kept us all comfortable. Santosh our second guide was there to lead the guys with a faster pace and kept us all amused with his sense of humour. I can't praise these two enough and I'm glad I got to spend 12 days under there care. If we had any worries or concerns they soon put our minds to rest which made me feel safe and relaxed during the entire trip.Our days were spent walking- taking in the scenery and our evenings playing cards together. My only query although not big enough to knock a star off my rating was that I booked this as 16 days rather than the 15 stated on the website at the agreed price with chhattra and then received an email from him (whilst in Kathmandu) stating I had to pay an additional $40 to the hotel Access Nepal to stay the final night or find a new hotel. I would have understood if this had of been mentioned at the time of booking the trip but it was a little inconvenient whilst actually in Nepal when I was under the impression that everything was paid for in the itinerary I received at the time of booking.Regardless of this, Overall the Everest base camp trip surpassed my expectations, I had the most fantastic time. I made friendships that will last a lifetime and to be in the company of the great Himalayas is an experience I shall treasure forever! You can't beat the knowledge and attentiveness of the guides, and the speedy response from chhattra, In my opinion you can't beat it and I would recommend everyone to use Nepal Eco adventures for their travels in Nepal.Hopefully I'll be back soon to tackle Annapurna :) thanks for everything Sam"

All the way from BhuleBhule to Porkhara.As an inexperienced and unfit trekker, it was nice to have a very knowledgeable and one of the most nicest guide and of course porter ever. Bam was familiar with the route and all the significant points and views. I found it convenient for me to have someone help with my luggage and a well laid out itinerary. That is what I would call a nice vacation. Hands off!!Remember to bring a camera, for those who love photgraphy, some reading material, some nice music for those who love their own company and some nice companion. But like a friend of mine said, always remember to savour the moment with your eyes before you take it all in the camera.In short, It was one of the best experiences I have had in my life."

With 3 weeks to prepare and as a solo female traveller, I feel lucky to have found Nepal Eco Adventures. From the very first correspondence, I knew I was in good hands and all the positive reviews only reinforced my feelings. Chhatra was very responsive and patient with my multiple email inquiries. I considered different times and trek options, eventually settling on doing the EBC trek with Gokyo Lakes and Cho La Pass. Even though it was longer than the standard EBC trek, it made for a more unique and breathtaking loop. The trek was very well planned \u2013 including 2 days in Kathmandu before flying to Lukla, and then having 3 extra days at the end to allow to return to Kathmandu in case of bad weather in Lukla. Our group actually experienced weather related delays on the way back, so I was lucky to have had all these extra days, otherwise, I\u2019d miss my international flight back to Canada. About the trek \u2013 it was a trip of a lifetime with breathtaking scenery, wonderful people, and memories that will last forever. Again, I was lucky to find myself in a group with 3 other travellers, all from different countries and even continents. We all got along great, had similar pace when trekking, and had a wonderful time overall. Narayan Rai was our guide. Not only does he have extensive trekking, mountaineering, and rescue experience, but I swear he knows all the local people and speaks a bit of all languages that you may encounter on the trek. Always in a good mood, smiling, and positive, he is a very gifted \u201cpeople person\u201d. Narayan made our experience very special by choosing to bring us to very interesting Tea houses and restaurants, some of which were owned by Sherpa who were either part of the Everest expedition now, or have done one (and even several) before! Imagine talking to someone who climbed Everest 10 times or being able to visit a tent at Base Camp! All thanks to Narayan. Narayan was also very attentive and helpful in all situations, including when I got stomach sickness and had to spend one of the rest days in bed. Having him measure my oxygen was helpful because it confirmed that it was not altitude sickness. During the trek, I tried to follow Narayan as much as possible- he made trekking look so effortless, no matter at what altitude. Later on, when I would get very tired, he stayed back and walked with me. I cannot say enough good things about Narayan and express my gratitude for this experience. As for my brief stay in Kathmandu, the hotel was very comfortable, even though I was worried because in some of the trip advisor reviews people were not too happy. All I can say is that I was surprised how luxurious it was and I would definitely stay there again. Our city guide was Raju, a walking encyclopedia! He introduced us to the culture, religions, history, politics, etc. Raju was not only knowledgeable but also very charismatic and personable. He also has a great voice - made a great singer together with the driver, which to this moment represents one of the happiest memories from the trip. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Nepal Eco Adventures. I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking for an authentic experience of trekking in Nepal. Thank you to the entire Nepal Eco Adventure Team."

It was a spur of the moment decision-- 20% based on testimonials and 80% side-by-side comparison versus other companies.If I were to undergo the process all over again, I would look no further than the testimonials about this team. Surely, people will recognize the warm, personal, yet utterly professional approach that Chhatra, Ram, Santosh, the porters and even their drivers use.As we've experienced (you may refer to my wife, @patriciacpab 's posts), we were simply awed by the wonders of the entire trek despite the massive physical undertaking. And this is because NEA faciltiated everything smoothly. Some top strong points for NEA:> Chhatra's timely response to our first query. First impressions last.> NEA is very sincere with their recommendations, ie when to book your trip, the people you're going to be grouped with, why we shouldn't be anxious abut certain things... This speaks highly of the company's values.>Profile of their guides. I've met two of their lead guides, but I could only speak fully about RAM, the alpha-guide. His trekking skills are top-notch--from basic mountaineering to practical reasons such as when to take a shower. Ram is very reliable. Like NEA, Ram is sincere in ensuring that you feel safe and satisfied throughout the trek. Other trekking groups even consult him! This happened when one of the members of another group was suffering severe AMS-- good thing that Ram/NEA carries around their own oxymeter!>NEA maintains a good network among hotels and stops. You don't have to worry about missing a slot, or even missing a table.>NEA is a highly local company. We felt that in supporting NEA, a relatively small trekking company we were 100% supportive of the local economy. (Sure, they don't carry around reservation signs for our dinner table, but they make things happen!)Our EBC trek is the best, most out-of-this-world and exciting trip we've ever done and I just can't imagine taking NEA out of the equation."

            "review": "Awesome Annapurna Circuit. The Annapurna Circuit was an incredible and memorable trek organised by Nepal Eco Adventures: I chose a 18 day trek, which was actually around 14 days of walking from Besisahar to Ghorepani and then Nahyipul, 1 day acclimitisation in Manang, 1 full day in Pokhara and 2 days of travel (to and from Kathmandu). Our guide, Bam Magar, was phenomenal -- extremely knowledgeable about the different routes, very experienced (been a guide since the early 1990s), knew some really good places to eat and sleep, was very flexible, and was a good travel companion. Over the course of 14 days, I got to know quite a few of the guides, and Bam was definitely one of the best -- so would recommend asking for him (he also books groups privately).The route is very manageable and most days we would finish the days walking soon after lunch. Perhaps it would take an extra hour or two for a less fit group (so on average 5-6 hours/day, including stops for breaks and lunch). Our route was as follows:Day 01:Drive from Kathmandu to besisahar/Balbule (923m). -- VERY VERY long drive. lots of traffic, slow moving, took about 10 hours. Day 02:Trek to Jagat (1410m). -- Jagat is a beautiful town, but the walk here is not particularly exciting. I think Jagat or Syenge would be good starting placesDay 03:Trek to Dharapani (2160m).Day 04:Trek to Chame (2710m). -- beautiful locationDay 05:Trek to Upper Pisang (3240m). -- beautiful locationDay 06:Trek to Manang (3540m). -- recommend taking upper route, rather than the road.Day 07:Acclimatization day at Manang. -- must do walk to monastery, ice lake or Gangapurna glacier lake -- great viewsDay 08:Trek to Yak Kharka (4120m). --very short day, but necessary for acclimitisationDay 09:Trek to Thorung Phedi (4,560m). --very short day, but necessary for acclimitisationDay 10:Over Thorung La (5,416m) to Muktinath (3,802m). -- long tough day, but well worth it! I would recommend NOT staying in Muktinah, but rather walking to next town (20 minutes away) of Jharkot (much more rustic and interesting and less touristy). If you have the extra energy, can even do the 2-3 hour walk to Kagbeni!Day 11:Trek to Kagbeni (2840m). -- if you're on a tight schedule, can just walk through Kagbeni (to see the beautiful Mustang desert landscape) and stop in Marpha for the nightDay 12:Trek to Marpha(2670m) -- fantastic, must stay here! beautiful white lime-washed walled town.Day 13:Trek to kalopani(2530m) -- town has great mountain views, but town itself is dissapointing. Next town over Lede seemed less touristy and more beautiful.Day 14:Trek to Tatopani(1290m) Natural hot spring. -- I'm not that interested in concrete hot springs, next time will stay in smaller village.Day 15:Trek to Ghorepani (2750m). -- spectacular views from top of the hill (Superior Hill Hotel)Day 16:Early morning trek up to Poonhill and trek down to Nayapul then taxi to Pokhara. -- Great views from top of PoonhillDay 17: Pokahara -- worth spending an extra day here, drinking beer and relaxing by the lake.Day 18:Drive back to Kathmandu, transfer to hotel. -- VERY VERY long drive. lots of traffic, slow moving, took about 10 hours.I chose to go with a trekking company because I didn't want the hassle of organising transport, porters, accommodation, permits, food, etc. And Nepal Eco Adventures did a superb job, and I would recommend them to anyone. Retrospectively, it is relatively easy to organise these things, but it is still a pleasure to have everything sorted so efficiently by Nepal Eco Adventures. Chatra was also very helpful and quick in replying to emails, and very flexible with developing the itinerary. The company also gave the best value for money deal of any of the companies I explored.However, if you are a very fit/athletic person like me and experienced trekker, you may consider doing the route by yourself at your own pace, as it's very well marked trail and there are many places to eat and stay, and very safe. In this way you can adjust your route/walking distances as you feel fit. I would highly recommend the seamless experience provided by Nepal Eco Adventures for any standard trek in Nepal. But especially if you are NOT an experienced trekker, or don't have the fitness to do it alone, or don't want the hassles of organising any of the finer details!"

In addition to being patient (we were stopping all the time to take photos) Narayan was very observant, showing and telling us about wildlife and plants along the way and he knows a lot about the area and its history and culture. He is a very experienced guide as well as being calm, reliable and always in a good mood!We went on a six day trek from Syabrubesi to Kyanjin Gompa and a small peak just above the village. It was terrible to see the damage last year's earthquake had done in the valley, especially in Langtang, but everyone were working from early morning till nightfall to restore the the place. All the lodges we stayed at were very charming and the staff was always friendly and helpful, making us feel like home. We were very lucky with clear weather almost every day despite going trekking in the monsoon season, and I will absolutely recommend visiting this beautiful place with Nepal Eco Adventure. Having someone who takes care of everything; accommodation, meals, transport etc. is so comfortable, you won't have to do anything else than walk and enjoy the view!PS. Be prepared for a long and bumpy bus drive between Kathmandu and Syabrubesi, the view makes it worth it!"

They take care of everything for you (hire porters, take care of TIMS card, national park permit, book flights, sleeping bags, etc) and at a reasonable price! We were always in good hands with our guide Nir. Not only was he was very knowledgable and experienced guide, but also incredibly kind. When I was feeling some of the negative side effects of the altitude, he was always sure to check in on me and make me feel better. Plus he always had a good stash of Happy happy's(chocolate chip cookies) available! I'd highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventures to anyone considering doing trekking in Nepal - especially with Nir!"

            "review": "Great Local Company & Tour to Everest Base Camp. We recently returned from a private tour to Everest Base Camp with Nepal Eco Adventure. I decided to go through this company due to the great reviews on TripAdvisor. We also decided that doing a private tour would be a much better option than a big group tour - as we could be flexible with our trekking times and walk up to Everest Base Camp at our own pace.From the moment I contacted their office, Chhatra (manager) was very helpful and very flexible in planning our trek for us. He speaks wonderful English and looked after us very well. Our booking was made in 2015 before the earthquake in Nepal. Due to nerves, we asked if we could postpone our tour to 2016, which Chhatra had no problem in doing for us. We are very thankful for this. His prices and itineraries are very good and you'll find them a lot better value than a majority of the other bigger companies around.Upon arrival in Kathmandu, the airport is a crazy place and were glad that we had our own private transfer waiting for us. They took us to the office where we picked up our trekking gear and then headed to the Radisson (great accommodation in Nepal by the way) for a couple nights. It must be noted that Chhatra provided us with sleeping bags, duffle bags and trekking poles - which saved us buying our own. A nice touch from the company.The first part of the tour was a city tour around Nepal. Unfortunately, a lot of the city is still in the rebuild phase after the earthquake and while it is sad to see, it was a rather long day looking at the same sort of stuff. It probably could have been half the length that it was. Our guide for the day was ok, but he did seem more interested in taking phone calls than playing tour guide. The driver was fantastic though and I was still glad to have seen everything I did!When the time came to fly up to the mountains and start the trek, we were picked up from our hotel and really looked after by our guide, Ram (there's 2 Ram's at Nepal Eco Adventure - we had Big Ram). He checked us in and helped us with getting our luggage sorted. He also helped us get the best seats on the small plane so we could get the best views over the mountains as we flew into Lukla. His 20 years trekking experience really shows as he knows everybody and everyone is so glad to see his smiley face.For the whole trek, Ram was very patient with us. We were very slow walkers compared to most on the trails as we had never been at altitude before, so some of the days really took it out of us. But Ram never complained and always stayed a few feet in front to help us keep going. We never felt rushed and he always encouraged us to stop and take rests and photos.The accommodation that was chosen for us was always indoors in cosy little teahouses. While these are fairly basic hotels, the ones Ram chose for us were of very good quality compared to what other people were staying in. The toilets were mainly western style and the rooms were generally spacious enough with comfortable beds. I felt this was a much better option than going on a World Expeditions Tour - where they have to stay in tents and use outside toilets! I could only imagine how cold those poor people would be! The communal dining area in each teahouse was always warm in the evening when they started up the fire. The food at every stop is basically the same - loads of carbs (pizza, pasta, sandwiches, potatoes, etc.)! But in saying that, it is fantastic food and we never went hungry. You all need to try a Mars or Snickers roll when you go - AMAZING! The owners at each guesthouse were friendly and very accommodating. The scenery itself is what you'd expect in the Everest region - spectacular! Every day would bring new views, new mountains to see and amazing photo opportunities. The weather was great - sunny skies every day until about 2pm, and then the afternoon cloud would roll in and cool things down. While it did snow and the winds were cold, it was quite pleasant in the sun while we were trekking and by the time is cooled down, we were generally indoors anyway. Some days we braved very cold winds and cloud (about -15c), but if you're dressed appropriately, then it's fine.The trek itself is not for the faint-hearted. It is pretty tough going and there were times where we wanted to turn around and just go home. But everyone has these thoughts, and it is a mental game to make it all the way to Everest Base Camp. When you finally reach it though, you are glad you stuck it out and put in the massive effort to make it. It's a once in a lifetime experience that only very few can say they have achieved.One of the highlights of our trip was actually our porter - Rodna. He was a young, 26 year old Nepalese lad who grew up in the mountain region. He was so little and skinny, yet so strong as he carried both of our very heavy duffle bags each day. He worked so hard and we are so very thankful for all his hard work. We could tell he was very poor, but he always had a smile on his face and went out of his way to look after us. While he spoke very little English, we believe this brought an extra charm to his ways. He taught us card games, was always singing and never failed to bring us fresh fruit each night after dinner. I really hope Chhatra knows how valuable Rodna is to his team - a wonderful little porter!Overall, this was a fantastic trip that has memories that will stick with us for a lifetime. While it is tiring, it is definitely worth the effort to say you've made it to Base Camp and to see the wonderful sights of the Himalayas! We wouldn't have made it without our wonderful guide Ram and his little sidekick Rodna - thank you ever so much, boys! Chhatra's experience in trekking and running a business is wonderful and it was a pleasure dealing with him. Thanks for making our EBC dreams come true!If you're a bit worried about heading to Nepal after the Earthquake, don't be. While some older buildings and roads are still getting rebuilt in Kathmandu,the mountain region is fine and there are no signs of the earthquake even occurring. The danger of another earthquake has passed and you should feel safe knowing you're in the very capable hands of Nepal Eco Adventure!Thanks for the wonderful adventure!"

Chhatra was approachable and easy to get answers from before and during my visit. Trekking solo, with a guide and porter allowed me to set my pace to my liking, as well as the start and finish time. My guide Shiva and porter Ram were attentive and pleasant. The experience was everything I hoped for. As I finished my trek 6 days early, I ended up organizing a sight seeing trip of Nepal on the fly, making it up as I go. Chhatra was immediately receptive, answering whatsapp messages, arranging drivers, hotels, flights, he made it all as easy for me as possible. I highly recommend Chhatra and Nepal Eco Adventure for any travel need in Nepal."

Incredible scenery in an amazing country, along with Chhatra and Nepal Eco Adventures really did give me an unforgettable trekking experience. When booking the trip online, I was naturally a bit reserved as the package sounded extremely reasonable and I assumed there would be some hidden costs. However, I was wrong as everything was seamlessly taken care of and included, from airport transfers to hotel bookings to trekking permits! Chhatra is a lovely man who truly takes care of his customers, and really does go out of his way to give them unforgettable experiences. When speaking to Chhatra about his philosophy, he realises that price in no longer the determining factor that Trekkers look for when booking treks and therefore strives to deliver exceptional experiences (although the price is still really good!). I can confirm his company did this and cannot recommend Nepal Eco Adventures more for Nepal trekking holidays."

You will not find a better treatment and experience than the one Nepal Eco Adventure can provide through their dedication, experience and motivation to make everyone get the very best out of their travels in Nepal, this i guarantee.They were the best travelling partner i could ever have hoped for. My objective in Nepal was to go to Sindhupalchowk to see the true Nepal and to experience and document what life is like for those hardest affected by the earthquake. My translator, guide and now friend Raju was smart, knowledgable, kind, funny, courageous, reliable and indeed a great guide- but an even better person. My requests and destinations were by no means easy and accessible but Raju and Chattra did everything i could have ever wished for- and more in our attempts of getting there. Basically i could not have requested a more difficult task but with the help of Raju it was made overwhelmingly easy. Together me and Raju went to places very few ever go but in his company i couldn't have felt more comfortable. Nepal is a beautiful place with wonderful people and scenery and sharing them with a person as Raju added so much to an already incredible experience. Thank you so much for giving me an unforgettable time, i will stand by this agency as being the best in Asia for the rest of my life."

I travelled with two friends to Nepal in January and would highly recommend Nepal Eco Tours!Although January is not peak time to trek to Everest Base Camp, Chhatra was very enthusiastic for our trip and organised all the details with prompt emails - the process was very straight forward. He welcomed us to Nepal and is a very friendly guy. Nir was our guide for the trek and he was great. Knowledgable of the area and supportive when we had difficulties. He regularly checked our oxygen levels and heart rate to make sure we were acclimatising to the altitude. Our porter Mekman deserves a medal for carrying our gear!When one of our group fell ill, Nir and Chhatra were excellent at organising a helicopter back to Kathmandu and a hospital bed.We had great weather - very cold but sunny most days ensuring we got spectacular views. Also by trekking in January the route is fairly quiet so you feel you have it more to yourself but we still met great people to share the trip with.Our whole experience in Nepal was amazing. The Himalayas are incredible and I can't wait to return to the mountains. Our trip included a guided tour of Kathmandu which was fascinating and we enjoyed exploring vibrant Thamel.Trekking in Nepal is an incredible experience!! Go for it!"

I would highly recommend the Everest Base Camp trip with this company as they made sure we had the best accommodation and food throughout the whole trip. The porter we had was friendly as well. There were times when I felt worried about things due to altitude e.t.c and Ram made me feel I was in the right hands at all times. Not at any point did I fear for my safety. They use a heart and breathing monitoring device as well that most companies don't use which again makes you feel safer. Anyway you won't regret using the company take my word. I plan to use them again next year for the Annupurna Circuit. Thanks again Chhatra and Ram. See you soon."

Being my first solo trip for my 30th birthday, this was a big deal to me. As said in a lot of other reviews, Chhatra is very timely and thorough with his responses. before my arrival we only communicated via email however he answered every one of my plentiful questions and put my mind at ease especially since this was my first solo trip ever. I booked everything 1 week before and they were still able to accommodate me. It's nice how Chhatra comes to the hotel in Kathmandu to meet the guests and answer any other questions they may have and just have a good conversation. After our first meeting at the hotel He took me shopping to find a few things I needed, and that really made me feel comfortable and less anxious as I was a bit scared to go out alone. After that I was walking around Thamel like a local. The Nepali people are so lovely, kind, humble and smiley. My driver in Kathmandu - Shreehari - is so cool, he could totally run his own party bus and drive around Kathmandu playing awesome music, as we had done a few times. Raju my guide for the whole trip is amazing - very attentive, accommodating, knowledgeable, funny and kind. My porter Govinda is so sweet, always smiling and never complained about my incredibly heavy bag which he carried with absolute ease, while I'm struggling up the steps with my backpack weighing 500grams. The lodges we stayed at on the trek were on point, I paid for a single room and always had private facilities. My favourite place was Ghorepani, met some really cool locals there and had the best time ever. I am planning on doing a longer trek the same time next year with Nepal Eco Adventres. Nepal is such a beautiful country with beautiful people. My advice when travelling in general, have a open-mind, a positive attitude and ALWAYS make time for the locals.If you're in a group or travelling solo, don't hesitate. Book now!"

He was really funny, didn't bombard us with facts about flora and fauna and the politico-historical situation, he just let us ease into the trek. We were paired up with a couple who never stopped complaining for the first few days and they were really high maintenance but once they finished we were able to properly enjoy the views, the walking and the tea houses. Our porter initially was a puny 22 year old student who was too weak to carry our bags so we replaced him with a proper local Sherpa who did a great job. I'm so grateful to Nepal Eco Adventure for organising all the paperwork to do with the climbing permits, assigning us such a great guide and plotting out an achievable and stunning route for us to do. So many great sights and variety in scenery - it was honestly amazing and humbling."

Was not that keen on the Katmandue hotel was in a noisy area and the linen stank of smoke. Breakfast next day was good. The 6 hour bus ride to Pokhara was very unpleasant. We only took the bus as we believed from the company litreture that we needed to allimaitse to the altitude. Pokhara it's self is a much more relaxed place than Katmandue and the 2nd hotel the Third Pole was basic but clean with friendly helpful staff. Start of the trek went well until, we started to clime the hundreds of steps and our guide was keener on keeping up with another party than staying back with us. It was very obvious from the start that our pace was much slower but he still talked us in to completing all the steps in one day. Again keeping up with the other party. We could not keep up the pace and insisted the guide stay with us. The next 2 days were much more enjoyable as we slowed our pace and were able to take pictures and rest when we needed to. I expected the accomadation to be basic but it was more so than I had thought. We changed our plans on the way back and took a jeep which cut out 2 hours walking. Back at the Third pole hotel we got a room with a bath which was really appreciate. (Will review hotel separately) We flew back to Katmandue (prearranged) We declined to stay in the original Katmandue hotel and booked into the Hyatt. (Was worth every penny)ConclusionShould have done more homework my selve and not relied on company information (to general)Wish I took thermals and a hot water bottle. Annapurna mountain range and Rhodadendrum Forrest spectacular sights. I am glad I have seen them."

Coming from a flat, hot country we were not as prepared as we could have been for the walking involved.Our tips would be to:Take the internal flight from and to Kathmandu and refuse the bus. Cost is more but worth it.Refuse the hotel offered in Kathmandu and pick your own based on your own research. The hotel choice is not good from Nepal Eco Adventures.Take a hot water bottle and get used to using a bucket at night. Take the sleeping bags offered and learn the Nepalise for slow down."

If you are considering a trek in Nepal and are based in Kathmandu, Eco Adventure Nepal should absolutely be first choice!Chhatra, the chap who will fill you in on everything about the trek that you are curious about, is an ex-guide and the business owner so knows his stuff! We turned up short of a few bits we required initially and were fitted up and supplied with the gear we lacked immediately at his office.We chose the Langtang Valley trek which begins in the Village of Syabru Bensi. Our guide, Nikhil Basnet (Nik) was excellent and more than willing to go over and above if needed! He sorted a more comfortable trip for us on the first leg (Kathmandu to Syabru Bensi). Which gave me some peace of mind considering my nervous disposition as a passenger on the road. We travelled by jeep instead of local bus at no extra cost.Each day we set off early and our meals were paid for breakfast, lunch and dinner as part of the initial cost. Each night we were given fresh fruit after dinner that Nik carried along the way in his bag. Along side this, a medical kit and phone for outside the mountainous region contact.We had chosen not to take a porter and carry our own kit.My friends and I struggled to keep the pace that Nik had. We are all in our early twenties and Nik is 10 years our senior. However, he caught on to our slow moving trekking and stuck either close in front or behind with us, letting us stop for a snack and drink when we were in need. We trekked to Mundu, the next village onward from Langtang around 3400m. All along the way Nik was very informative of the surrounding area and path we trekked. Being a former porter (since 14!) he is very aware of the landscape and knowledgable.Unfortunately one of our friends fell ill with a cross, we believe, between altitude sickness and potentially something he had eaten or had to drink.Nik was quick to act and without fuss called Chhatra who then called in an emergency Helicopter to transport us and our sick friend back to Kathmandu. A normally 3 day trip back to the city had only taken us 20 minutes by chopper. The Insurance covered this no problem (a must have and not to be scrimped on!).Previously on the trek we tried to reduce our backpack weight by leaving clothes and other items at various villages along the way. Nik made room in his pack and sacrificed his quick getaway to Kathmandu and made off down the hill to our stops before, collecting 6 different items scattered between villages, only to return them to our hostel in Kathmandu a day later!We were incredibly grateful.A couple of days later when our friend returned from the hospital Nik joined us for lunch for a chat and a Laugh.Chhatra even left his office too to visit our sick friend in the hospital and see how he was! Excellent experience, always more confidence inspiring when you have people who enjoy what they do and know what they're talking about.Neil."

We were blessed with clear sunny weather everyday which I didn't expect for winter. The views and sights were breathtaking!My guide Ram was a gentleman, he was diligent at taking care of all of my needs. He was very sociable and spoke perfect English, it felt like trekking with a friend. He is very fit so even though I felt like I was pushing my limits physically he always was able to stay with me. We were able to squeeze 2 days trekking into a day (from Gorak Shep to Namche Bazaar), just because I wanted to use wifi and have a hot shower.Many people consider doing the trek without a guide or porter to save money, although its possible, most people who I met were struggling carrying their bags, constantly counting their pennies and having to find accomodation. Sure, they will have some saved money but their experience seemed a lot more stressful. I would recommend paying a lump sum and not having to worry about anything. I had 3 decent meals a day during the trek and with Eco tours I felt I got the best room where ever I stayed.If you go trekking take some books and cards (the guides usually know some fun card games). As some days you will arrive as early as 1pm with a whole day to kill, but no TV or internet. My porter was also very kind and humble. I was able to have dinner at his house and meet his family during the trek which was a fascinating experience for me.I couldn't recommend Eco Tours enough. Thanks!"

I was ridiculous the amount of care, effort and time they put into me to make the trip as worthwhile as I had imagined it to be. Chaatra took time out of his schedule to meet me at the airport, make me feel comfortable and even took me to a place to purchase all of my trekking gear to avoid being ripped off. He even lent me his personal items so that I could minimise my spending and future carrying load (as I was going to continue travelling after the trek). It was so generous of him! Ra Ju took me on a tour of Kathmandu and taught me so much about religion and culture- he's such an awesome dude and is the reason why we still keep in contact today! I originally booked a tour with 3 others, who unfortunately cancelled last minute due to the fuel crisis (that how now ended) and last years devastating earthquake (which does not effect the trek at all).. this meant that it was just going to be me, my guide and my porter on this trek. I was a little bit uneasy as I didn't know if the guide and porter would be able to speak English and would be as festive as me over Christmas... After the 3rd day on the trek every single one of my fears and worries were overcome. My guide, Tshering - the coolest guy in town- and Pemba my porter - the happiest man to walk this earth- were the best company EVER! They took care of me and my fear of the dark, made sure I was comfortable every step of the way and altered the itinerary to suit my physical needs. They did this all in the goodness of their hearts! They spoke awesome english and had the best sense of humour which meant the 6 hours of downtime we had everyday felt like 1... We even met solo trekkers on the route who ended up trekking with us until the end. Tshering opened up his expertise to everyone that he met on the way and when I thought I was never going to make it over the pass, he stuck through with me in the blistering cold. I learnt enough Nepali to impress the locals and even learnt how to cook with them! It was just so amazing having Tshering and Pemba- they were so open to teaching me and the 3 boys that we met the ins and outs of Nepali culture and history! I really felt like a local! I went travelling solo for 5 months around Europe and Asia. People ask me what my favourite part was and without hesitation it would be the 18 days I spent on the mountain with Tshering, Pemba, Aaron, Sander and Jo (the 3 boys we met) all because of Chaatra from Nepal Eco Adventures. If you want to be seriously looked after at a personal level you would be absolutely kidding yourselves if you didn't book Nepal Eco Adventures. They're the most flexible, understanding and caring group of people you will ever meet. Will totally be back in the next year or so to do another with them. Come as strangers and leave as friends!

We felt going in December was the best time for the trek, since it was not peak season, so the trails were not very crowded. The weather was a little cold, but manageable and we had clear skies for the entire trek. The guide did a great job and helped us reach our goal. The trekking was not very difficult (around 4-5 hours a day) and the views are spectacular. Sun rise a Poon Hill and base camp were definitely the highlights of the trip."

I thought it might be difficult to trek in Nepal as a solo female, but the NEA team made it easy by going through great lengths to make sure I was comfortable and that general logistics were taken care of from the moment I landed at the airport. Queries via email were responded to quickly with friendly, honest, and helpful advice. My trekking guide Shiva spoke good English, had excellent knowledge about treks/culture/wildlife/fauna, and was the most assuring and fun guide I could ask for. Trek route was safe, food was delicious, and accommodation was clean. The beauty of Nepal is truly spectacular and its people filled with warm hospitality. I can't wait for the next chance to do another trek."

From the very first moment I made contact with Chattra, I knew we would be in good hands.I had put together a brief of what I envisaged our family holiday to be, emailed several top tour operators (many recommended) and Chattra from Nepal Eco Adventure was the only one who was quick, responsive, professional, knowledgeable and experienced.We worked on an itinerary for a private tour, which later was changed following the Earthquake.Our trip took us on a mix of 'Nepalese flats\" (never believe a Nepalese flat) and cultural experiences. As we only had 10 days on the trek, we hiked part of the Annapurna circuit, starting at Pokhara (private jeep/bus to Tatopani) Walking from Tatopani through to Shikha - Ghorepani - Poon Hill - Tadapani - Ghandruk - Landruk - Phedi and back vehicle back to Pokhara.Life in the mountains is beautiful, basic, with warm hospitality and spectacular views. We loved every moment of the trek and although classed as an easy trek, there were many ups and downs which challenged our fitness. We were three people - my husband, 14 yo daughter and myself. We organised for a guide and two porters. Our wonderful guide Ram (although his real name is Jirel Hukum) was very experienced and he spoke very good English. Our trek was a holiday for him as he is used to getting up and down Everest Base Camp! He was respectful, warm with a gentle demeanour. He made us feel confident all the way. The two lovely porters were Santos and Mr G. The trio were a bubbly bunch when they got going in their native language or singing out loud their favourite beautiful Indian or Nepalese songs. My daughter, who was faster, enjoyed speeding ahead with the porters who looked after her and answered the endless questions.Our meal times took a while to get used to because they would ensure we were fed and settled before they ate anything. Even though we asked them to join us, very few times they did, as they sat with the 'family' our of respect.Our head porter, Santos, brought to our table a beautiful platter of slices of apple and pomegranate after every dinner. It was their way of saying good night. A lovely unexpected gesture, which was much appreciated and will be remembered.In a nutshell, our experience was wonderful and we would recommend Chattra and his crew to any of our family and friends wishing to have a similar adventure.I can't wait to come again and this time do the entire Annapurna Circuit!"

We had a rough itinerary that we were aiming for, but we had no idea how to go about it.We sent our itinerary to a few of the top listed TripAdvisor tour companies and Chhatra from Nepal Eco Adventures was not only the first to respond, he was also the only responder that seemed to have thoroughly read our itinerary. He not only understood what we wanted, but he was able to recommend some improvements to the trip that proved to be EXACTLY what we wanted. I could list all the times that Chhatra went above and beyond, but there were too many! He was always available, very communicative, knowledgeable and more than anything - willing to help.For the trek itself, Chhatra introduced us to Shiva, our guide. Shiva met us in KTM and took us all the way through the things that would have caused us dramas if we had been on our own i.e. flights (which can be a nightmare), permits etc.Shiva was a fantastic guide, he knew everyone! He was friendly, charismatic and engaging. There was never a dull moment around the fire at the end of the day! We were very lucky to be looked after by such a character. By the end of the trek, we were tired and sore, but thoroughly impressed with every aspect.I cannot recommend Nepal Eco Adventures enough. Chhatra and Shiva are two fantastic blokes."

(Honestly we dabbled with booking a US-based company but decided we liked the idea of supporting local business more.) We ended up picking the trek to Gokyo and hiked 12 days.Upon arriving to Kathmandu, Chhatra and his friendly driver met us with big smiles and got us to our hotel quickly - this was greatly appreciated after almost two days of flying. We were greeted with marigold flower necklaces too, which my wife definitely loved. The hotel selected by NEA was clean, centrally located and luckily equipped with a nice bathroom. Chhatra really put us at ease, we felt well prepared for the trek and he answered our endless questions with a smile. The day trips he arranged before and after the trek were lovely, it was great to get out of the \"touristy\" area and see other parts of town. I can't say enough about how professional and pleasant Chattra is to work with.Once we arrived in Lukla, we met our guide, Ram. My wife and I hit it off with Ram immediately, we are all around the same age (early 30s) and we ended up being the only two on the trek. Ram was such a great guide, he was patient with our questions and shared tons of trivia and information about the various mountains and history of the trek/Nepal. At night we often played card games ..where Ram beat us at numerous rounds of a local game ha. After a few days of trekking we all discussed our \"next trek\" and if we do venture back to Nepal, we would definitely book with NEA and request Ram."

All aspects of this trip were amazing--from the booking of the trip with Chhatra, to the tour of Kathmandu with RaJu, to the actual trek around Annapurna Circuit with Ram and Santos! Everyone was a pleasure to be with--friendly, helpful and welcoming. The trek over the Pass was a challenge, but the fact that we went higher gradually made it possible--even for a sixty something year old woman like me! The mountains and villages were amazing! It was cold (December) but most of the tea houses had a woodfire in the dining area. Food was really good--\"Dal bhat\" power! The fact that there were problems between India and Nepal (and a gasoline and propane shortage) did not affect the trip. We met other trekkers who did not have guides--including quite a few who were heading back the way they came because they didn't make it over the high pass--I wouldn't recommend going that route--especially when the weather can be questionable. We learned so much about the country from our guides. I'm looking forward to my next trek. This trip was really affordable--both the trek and the $650 plane ticket from LA to Kathmandu!"

I used Nepal Eco Adventure for Poon Hill trek and a trip with my family around Nepal.I had limited time for hiking so was looking for a 3-4 day hike in the Annapurna region. Poon hill trek was one of the top rated short hikes online. So, I contacted Nepal Eco Adventure regarding that hike and Chhatra got back to me the next day with a detailed itinerary. The cost was good and he took care of everything from right when I landed in Kathmandu - pick up from airport, hotel in Kathmandu, transport to Pokhara, food and accommodation during the hike, hiking permits, etc. It was nice to not have to worry about any of that during the trip. My guide, Ram was great. He was very friendly, accommodating and was happy to go at my pace. He made sure I got the best from the trip. The hike itself was great. The views from Gorepani and Poonhill were absolutely stunning. I had seen the pictures earlier; however, the views in person were surreal. We got lucky with the weather, it was completely clear.I also planned a trip with my family through Nepal Eco Adventure as well. After my hike I met up with my family in Pokhara. We stayed in Pokahara for a couple of days which was nice, then went to Chitwan National Park. This was the highlight of the trip with my family. Highly recommend canoeing in the river in the morning mist. Last part of our trip was cultural and architectural tour of Kathmandu. Our guide Durga was very knowledgable and friendly. Nepal Eco Adventure took care of everything - flights / buses between cities, accommodation, local tours. Again, not having to worry about any of that, made our trip easy and fun.I would highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventures for hiking or architectural / cultural tours. I'm already starting to plan my next trip - Everest Base Camp. Hopefully in 2017!"

I returned from Nepal just a month ago, having visited Kathmandu, Pokhara and Chitwan, and of course completing Everest Base Camp Trek with Kala Pathar. I initially only planned to do EBC and contacted Chhatra, the owner of Nepal Eco Adventure about, who immediately won my trust with his timely and knowledgeable answers. Thanks to this I also decided I wanted to to visit Chitwan and later Pokhara, which Nepal Eco Adventure arranged for me. Chhatra was very nice and obliging as my plans changed, making everything possible to realise them swiftly and smoothly. He also offered to provide down jackets, down sleeping bags, trekking poles and duffel bags to anyone in the group who didn't have any and did so free of charge - unlike most agencies who rent them. Of course, the highlight of the trip was the trek to Everest Base Camp, and I cannot thank enough my guide Ram, who was the best person you could hope to guide you through the mountains. He was always very informative about the places we visited and the peaks we were seeing as well as the local customs, and his English was fluent. The accommodations he chose for our group were the best we could hope for under the circumstances and he made sure everyone was comfortable. He advised us on food and made sure to check our oxygen levels twice a day. But the best part is, he was just fun to be around.:) I travelled as a part of an international group of six, with none of us knowing anyone in the group before, yet the group got along perfectly well and became friends. All of us reached EBC and summitted Kala Patthar. No one suffered from altitude sickness despite no one in the group taking Diamox, and I feel that this was at least partly thanks to the good care of our guide as well as the good acclimatisation routine we followed. Overall the EBC trip was a great success. The following visit to Chitwan was a nice contrast to the busy days on the trek. The jungle safari and the exposure to the Tharu culture were very nice, entertaining and relaxing. The resort we stayed at was also very nice, and our jungle guide was kind and knowledgeable. I also stayed in Pokhara for a couple of days, the second biggest city in Nepal, yet in many ways the complete opposite of Kathmandu. Chhatra helped arrange a trip to Sarangkot for me, but I also had plenty of time to wander on my own. I used the time to visit a Tibetan refugee camp by myself, where I met and talked with the Tibetans which was a very enriching experience. I also wandered around the lake, took a boat trip, visited the World Peace Pagoda as well as some local markets. Kathmandu was also nice, I had a personal city guide who took me around the city's landmarks. Again I had time to wander around on my own and very quickly felt right at home there. The best part was, that everywhere I went I met someone from my EBC trekking group. So even though I came to Nepal completely alone, everywhere I was with friends. If I visit Nepal again (which I plan to do), I would surely use Nepal Eco Adventure again. Happy holidays, Nepal Eco Adventure!"

From the word go, the exact price including what was included in the total price and what we had to pay for was explained. Very professional, honest and trust worthy. Our trek was pretty remote and we had to have a guide, which was part of the permit deal, unlike Everest base camp and Annapurna treks. Our guide Pemba a local of the area, was brilliant, telling us about the local culture, and supportive, keeping us right, especially above the 4000m mark. The teahouses were pretty decent considering where we were. The chosen tea houses appeared to be the best in each village. And all under 4000m had really decent options other that just dal baht.There were very few fellow trekkers on this trek (and not WiFi or phone coverage) which was pretty magic. However all of them appeared to have significantly more for their trips than us. Word of advice go with a reputable Nepalese company. All the European, UK, US and Aus/NZ companies outsource to them but charge you thousands extra for the privilege!"

First we went to Chitwan, where we had two night safari package, and we enjoyed it a lot. The hotel was nice and our guide for the jungle treks was incredible. Only a small minus comes from the misunderstood of the elephant ride; I didn't want to take the elephant safari because of the bad reputation of those (all over the world, not precisely in Nepal) and we had asked for a jeep safari. They didn't know this in forehand at the hotel, but they managed to book us to the jeep safari instead of the elephant safari for extra money. So everything sorted out and the jeep safari was excellent!Then we had the ABC trek. We decided to finish the trek in 9 days, if something doesn't (sickness, injuries) come to our way. Our guide was Raju, who took very good care of us. Special thanks also to our porter, who also took care of us and asked how we feel etc during the trek, despite his limited English :)All of the tea houses and meals were better than we expected, and Nepal Eco Adventures offered fruits for dessert, which was a nice extra!Overall everything worked out really well and we were satisfied. All the people in Nepal who we met were incredibly nice to us, no hassle or anything and we felt very welcome, all the time. Highly recommending Nepal Eco Adventures and Nepal!"

He paced the trek ideally for my fitness level and knew every stop for the best possible photos. His choice of stops for food were well placed, the food was great and the accommodation for every night was better than I expected for the middle of the mountains. Well known and respected by his many friends and colleagues, I would trek again with Thakur any time.In summary, this was the trip of a lifetime.

From arrival to airport in Kathmandu until our departure, we felt completely serviced both by our guide, and by Chhatra (monitoring us from NEA's headquarters ).NEA provided us with a great and experienced guide, something that became very apparent when we compared with various other groups along the way. The difference in experience and professionalism was palpable compared to other outfits. Our guide verified our oxygen levels regularly, modified our diets for maximum calorie intake despite lack of appetite at higher altitudes, and provided lots of colorful stories along our trek. We felt we were trekking with long time friends. Their choice of tea houses was also very good- something you come to appreciate very quickly. They did not cut corners and it showed. At the end of the day, the real value of an outfitter comes when you hit a snag. And sure enough, when we did, Chhatra and our guide Nirs did everything right so that we had a safe and terrific experience. I would feel totally comfortable sending my children to Chhatra and his team. My only advice to trekkers, take NAE advice- if they say to take a few more days to your schedule, DO IT. Adding a few more slack days to your schedule so that you have the flexibility to adjust your calendar to the inevitable snags you are bound to hit will make a huge difference to your experience. Running tight on days is unnecessary when you come from such a long way. Thank you NEA, and hope to be back in the coming years."

He gave us a very patient, understanding and pleasent guide; Shiva Baniya. Our porter Mechman was a gem too.(City guide Raju made our city tours enjoyable as well)Day after day we had superb views, terrific trekking experience and a tranquil feel. The tea houses chosen by Shiva were decent, as clean as they can be in the situation. No trouble with food whatsoever. Always plentiful and delicious. Kala Patthar, Cho La pass and Gokyo Ri were not easy but the challenge was made welcome by these guys. We were impressed by the honesty, sincerity and genuine niceness of people we met along the way.Definitely a super experience."

The tour options available were extensive but well thought through and planned. Chhatra was quick to reply, gave excellent advice (we decided on a cultural tour, with a mountain stay, sunrise/sunset trip and lots of history) and guidance and was a pleasure to meet in person when we arrived. The price was very reasonable as well and it was good to have everything clearly included/not included. Our guide and driver were faultless. They gave us the opportunity to tailor the trip how we wanted, were faultless in terms of knowledge, skills and enthusiasm and most importantly were a real advocate and insight into Nepalese culture, society and history. They were both such an asset to Nepal Eco Adventure - it was sad to say goodbye to them! We are often travellers who 'diy-it', but we wanted to take the stress out of it for our honeymoon and we were so overwhelmed by the educational, relaxing and mesmerising experience we had, all thanks to Nepal Eco Adventure. 5 stars doesn't seem enough! All I can say is thank you so much and we would do nothing but recommend them for your trip(s) in Nepal."

Upon my arrival to Kathmandu Chhatra arranged airport pickup and personally met me even though it was 9pm, he made sure that I safely checked in in the hotel.Both of the guides Chhatra provided me with have shown great level of professionalism and were really nice people themselves. Ra Ju, who has shown me around Kathmandu, was not only very knowledgeable in terms of history but also had an awesome sense of humour which made the short tour quite a pleasant experience. Kumar, my guide for the trek, had a good level of English, and made sure that I had the best experience on the trek. He is a really caring guide and throughout 3 weeks treated me like his little sister. He shown a great level of flexibility as well. When I had an idea to opt out for Tilicho lake we worked on the alternative route to sqiz it in without affecting safety (we still had to accent slowly due to risk of AMS). As well we did all the possible side treks to avoid the road which made an experience even better. The lodges included in the package were quite good and offered wide variety of food.The views on trek were breathtaking and I really hope to come back soon to discover Everest region.Overall I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure as a company of great professionals and people.Thank you, Guys for this unforgettable experience!!!"

Once we arrived at Kathmandu airport, we received personal attention from Chhatra, and that lasted throughout the entire time that we were visiting Nepal He was always on hand to answer our questions, advise us and point us in the right direction. Chhatra has excellent English so there was no language barrier, and he was able arrange English speaking guides to explain the intricacies surrounding the historic sites that we visited in Kathmandu.Once on the trek, the guides were superb. Very patient, loyal, funny, and knowledgable about the areas we were passing through. Their English was also very good and they always took the time to point out interesting features and were very attentive to see how we were all coping with the altitude. They were also integral to offering advice about getting wifi, hot water and decent toilets where necessary. Our blood oxygen was measured daily to ensure that we were all managing the altitude. All the guides were aware of health and safety and were able to break the group, or alter the speed, in order that everyone could achieve the trekking stage. Very quickly they became not just guides, but our friends. The weather forced us to alter our plans three quarters of the way through the trek, and this was accommodated by Chhatra and his team with minimal fuss, and they were able to arrange an alternative plan very quickly. From historic sites, to mountain trekking and safaris, Chhatra and his agency were able to devise an itinerary to suit our wishes. They really made Nepal accessible and provided the best opportunities to see a truly beautiful country. I would highly recommend them to anyone considering a trip to Nepal."

He met me at my hotel after business hours, brought my guide, and went over what to expect. He delivered true to his word without any high pressure sales tactics. On the day of the tour, Nir met me on the way to Nagarkot and made sure I was very comfortable for the day's trip. He was very patient with me, allowing me to enjoy the scenery an photography opportunities at my leisure. Both Chhatra and Nir showed their professionalism through their coordination and communication, making sure I received special treatment serving my personal interests. Nir made sure I got a tour off the beaten path, giving me a very up close and personal look into the village life in rural Nepal. Nir was also very knowledgeable, with a full understanding of everything that met my eyes. He was also very easy going, and I appreciated the warm small talk along with ample time for me to get my own space.I would without a doubt book a Nepal Eco Adventure tour the next time I'm in Nepal. I am currently looking forward to coming back, as 4 days in this magnificent country are not nearly enough. When I do come back, Nepal Eco Adventure and Nir will be my first choice. Although they have been in business for roughly 2 years, both Nir and Chhatra boast a combined 35+ years experience giving tour guides. I can't wait to see them and their majestic country again.

Their specialty is mountain trekking and anyone looking to discover Nepal on foot would be in good hands with their experienced guides and we would surely use them again on other adventures. Unlike many corporates, Nepal Eco Adventures was started by a former local trekking guide and I would like to thank Chharta (the owner and our point of contact) for making this a most memorable trip. We are now inspired to train for the Everest Base Camp trek in 2016! On a side note, Nepal is as enchanting as it ever was. Tourism is thinner than usual post the earthquake but that was an incentive rather than a deterrent for us - and we were amply rewarded. Top notch service, less crowds and the same gorgeous walks and views."

I decided to initiate correspondence with them and this is when the excellent experience I had with them began. Chhatra, who is the owner of the company, always responded to my emails in a timely fashion. If I emailed in the evening I would usually have a response by the next morning. This worked well for me as there is a 11hr45 minute time change from where I live. I quickly gained confidence in Chhatra as he answered my many questions and made recommendations to me. When I arrived in Katmandu all of my expectations and needs were met or exceeded. I was met at the airport by a driver and an English speaking guide who took me to my hotel. The next day I had a tour of Katmandu by the same guide, which included seeing a lot of temples, shrines, and palaces. Chhatra picked all of the hotels I stayed in which I found very comfortable and nicer than I expected.All of my trip was customized just for me. I trekked the complete Annapurna Circuit with just myself and a guide [Pemba Sherpa] that Chhatra assigned to me. Pemba is not only a very good guide, always looking after my needs, but a great guy. He was my friend, companion, and also my cultural liaison. He told me about sites, history, mountains, time to next teahouse [which proved to be quite accurate] and life in general in Nepal. He also knew that route so well that we could take alternative trails thus avoiding roads in the area almost entirely. All of this proved invaluable and I had a fantastic trip. I often travel, hike, sail, by myself, but Pemba provided a great value added. I'd use a guide again.After trekking I visited Chitwan National Park which proved to be a relaxing change of pace and allowed me to experience other aspects of Nepal such as elephants, rhinos, crocodiles, and beautiful birds I had never seen before. There are also about 200 tigers in the park, but I never saw any of them.In summary, I found the Nepalese people very friendly, and I met many guides and porters along my route who became my friends and I believe were competent, but the main reason I would recommend Nepal Eco Adventure is that their organization and advice made it very easy for me to have a great trip without knowing much about Nepal beforehand."

Firstly I would like to say that Chhatra (The Managing Director) is a very patient and understanding person who tirelessly attended to my numerous inquiry emails and the subsequent changes I had to make to the itinerary when my travelling companion pulled out. Arriving to Nepal alone and doubtful, I was thankful that he faithfully waited nearly 3 hours for me outside the airport, due to baggage delays, and was still very cheerful about it and pleased to meet me. I did a 27 day trip (ABC + EBC treks) and Chhatra customized the itinerary for me to minimize any unnecessary costs and allowed me to transit hassle-free and seamlessly between treks all the way to my return flight back to Singapore. When the earthquake slightly damaged the original hotel included in my package, he upgraded me to a better hotel without additional charge! Trek-wise, my guide, Narayan Rai, had a very good command of English and was very friendly and caring, treating me like his little brother. He would go out of his way to explain to me facts about the mountains and villages along the way. He also plucked berries and various fruits from trees for me to eat and always tried to ensure that I got the best room in the guesthouse. In addition, he was totally flexible in changing the itinerary based on my needs and wants on any particular day and made my trip unique and memorable. Though I was alone for this whole period, but my needs and safety were always taken care of and I never felt lost or abandoned in any way. So now that I am back safely and happily in Singapore, I would like to thank Nepal Eco Adventures for orchestrating such a pleasant experience for me =) I recommend that you try and speak with Chhatra should you ever think of coming to Nepal on vacation, you will not regret it."

There was 13 in our group and we had 3 fabulous guides plus Chhatra who gave us their undivided attention. My husband and I were usually at the back of the group and Santosh, one of the guides, stayed with us all the time, he didn't rush us or make us feel uncomfortable, we passed others, who, when the last members of their group arrived, set off again, meaning that the people at the back never had chance to recover. When we arrived at our hotels and joined the rest of our group, they all encouraged and supported us and didn't make us feel as though we were holding them back, we couldn't have asked for more and we successfully arrived at base camp and achieved our objective. On the last day of our holiday, when the rest of our group flew home, we experienced the earthquake and even though we were still having aftershocks and just a couple of hours after the quake, Chhatra came to our hotel to check that we were safe and after we had spent a sleepless night, he was on the phone at 5.00am keeping us informed of our flight details and turning up at 8.00am to check we were still fine and arranging a car to take us to the airport. Nothing was too much trouble and our safety was his priority.I would advise anyone thinking of visiting Nepal to make sure they speak to Chhatra, he will make your holiday one you will never forget and when we visit Nepal again this is something we will certainly do."

We were most impressed with his speedy, informative and helpful emails. We wondered if he ever slept as it seemed no matter what time we emailed him we had a prompt reply.We were met the moment we exited airport customs and were very well taken care of every moment of the way by Chhatra and his team during our time. Our first nights were in a nice hotel within a short walking distance to Chhatra's office and we met Chhatra and our guide, Kumar, several times as we fine tuned our prep and plans for our Annapurna Panorama trek. Kumar picked us up on the morning we set off for Pokhara and was by our side for our entire travels and trek, taking care of all arrangements for bus and taxi travel, hotel in Pokhara and for our trek including all meals and guesthouses. We found the hotel in Pokhara to be first rate and each of the guesthouses along the trek were very suitable to our needs. The menus at the guesthouses were pretty standard and offered a reasonable variety of hearty, home made and most often delicious food served in large portions. Personal favourites included Dal Bhat, moo moos, the soups and awesome wood fired pizza.Kumar was an excellent guide and his English served us well. He had a quiet disposition, a great sense of humour and was very knowledgeable, informative and professional. He kept a close eye on us and set a varied pace to match our speed that was never hurried, allowed for many photos and other stops and yet always got us to the next guesthouse in good time. It was very evident that our safety was always Kumar's first priority and his diligence and caution served us well when the first earthquake tremor and the many follow-ups occurred. Always under Kumar's watchful eye, we safely completed the last three days of the trek back to Pokhara.The trek route itself was very enjoyable and not too taxing to a moderate level. The sunrise at Poon Hill on day three was so incredible as to make it all very worthwhile. Because of the earthquake we were unable to complete the safari.When we arrived back in Kathmandu after completing the trek Chhatra was there to meet us and take us to a room he had secured at one of the few operating hotels in the Thamel District. He was constantly in touch by phone and in person with us over the next several days as we worked to secure new flights home. Whether it was 8 in the morning or 930 at night he was there for us and other of his clients who were at the same hotel. Despite the pressures that the earthquake must have brought him and his family, Chhatra provided my daughter and me with an incredible level of service and support during those challenging days for everyone. From first contact to our goodbye, our experience with Chhatra and his team were first rate. Everything was as we expected and we found Chhatra to be very professional and trustworthy. We were left with no concerns or complaints whatsoever.As Nepal and Chhatra and his team all recover from the earthquake tragedy, we would very much encourage people who are interested in any of his treks, safaris etc to contact Chhatra to plan future visits. I am confident that Chhatra will give an honest assessment of each region's recovery and guide you to a most enjoyable and memorable experience in beautiful Nepal. We will definitely return as soon as we can."

We had to improvise quite a bit due to weather conditions, but every circumstance we met was solved rapidly. For example, the second part of our trekking we were taken to Langtang as we could not proceed on the Manaslu circuit.Traveled as a single female, never felt unsafe or unpleasant.Thanks team at Eco Adventure for the excellent trek and great time. So glad to hear that you are all ok after the terrible tragedy that hit Nepal. Hope travellers will return soon, beautiful Nepal and the wonderful Nepali deserve it."

We used Nepal Eco Adventures for our entire private trip to Nepal which included an 8 day trek in the Everest region, sightseeing in Kathmandu and a Safari in Chitwan National Park. I can only agree with other comments. Chhatra did a great job of promptly answering all my e mails, addressing any questions or concerns, and organizing every detail in a professional manner. All the arrangements made were done precisely to what had been agreed upon and all transactions were handled professionally. If Chhatra is the brains of the organization, then Nir, our guide, is the heart and soul! Nir won us over from the first moment we met, with his enchanting smile, excellent English and engaging personality. On our trek he took especially good care of us and accommodated our needs, modified plans without any problems, when things did not go exactly as planned (my husband got the flu). We loved the many details that Nepal Eco Adventures attended to, that ensured our comfort and safety especially the fact that Nir had a pocket pulse oximeter to monitor for altitude sickness which is important when hiking at high altitudes. Overall a terrific experience I would recommend this company to anyone traveling in Nepal."

I initially signed up for the 17 day Annapurna Circuit in February '15 but finished 4 days ahead of schedule, this was never a problem and suited me as I wished to spend more time in certain areas - Tatopani and Pokhara. I received regular updates from Chhatra and quick responses to any questions I had from booking to completing the trek. Specialist equipment such as sleeping bag, down jacket and walking poles were also supplied with no additional cost. My guide Nik was fantastic had loads of experience, so much fun and I felt like I was treated as a King throughout my trek. Most importantly though when I had really awful symptoms of altitude sickness (feeling like death approaching), with Nik's experience, reassurance and the kindness of the tea lodge hosts I survived and still completed the circuit (if it wasn't for them, I would probably not have completed the circuit). I would thoroughly recommend this company to anybody who has not done any trekking before (like myself) or just wants a more care free approach to trekking as all your worries are in the very capable hands of Nepal Eco Adventure. Only recommendation the hotel you stay in at Pokhara - lovely but please not on the 5th floor I have had enough steps for the rest of my life after Ghorepani. Thank you very much for such a brilliant trek and adventure in Nepal."

We acclimatized slowly so we did not get altitude sickness and were healthy throughout the trek. Our guide Ram knew the region, trails, and teahouses well.

Our initial inquiries were promptly and thoroughly answered by Chhatra, and in the end we booked our trek for an excellent price on the precise dates we wanted with all the extra equipment we didn't have included in the price (jackets, sleeping bags and trekking poles). We had a bit of a problem getting to Nepal (a Turkish Airlines aircraft had been damaged on landing at Kathmandu, closing the airport for 4 days), but Chhatra maintained constant email contact with us on the situation, and in the end we managed to depart on our trek only one day late. Our guide, Jiba, and our porters were truly outstanding. Jiba spoke excellent English (and good German, too!) and our helpers went above and beyond their duty to make sure we were comfortable, well-fed and happy throughout the trek. Alas, deep snow prevented us from making it through the Larke pass, but the views need Lau and Samagaun were still stunningly beautiful. Nevertheless, Chhatra treated us to a wonderful dinner out in Kathmandu to make up for not completing our circuit--a very generous and kind gesture that we all appreciated. Chhatra also arranged several day tours in and around Kathmandu at very reasonable prices. All in all, I have trekked in the Alps, the Andes and the Rockies, and this was absolutely the best experience I've had with a trekking agency. Highly recommended."

When I was planning my adventure to Nepal, Chhatra was fantastic. Great at replying quickly, professionally and totally flexible with regards to planning the trek. Our guide Ram was also fantastic, he knew the routes very well, shared all of his knowledge and experience. He was also funny and would hang out with us every night, playing card games etc. Also our porters were equally great, even with their low level of English they tried their hardest to communicate and be part of the group. The only bad thing was flying to and from Kathmandu - Lukla. We had a two day wait on the way out and a three day wait on the way home. I only just made my international flight the following day! The company I flew with was called Goma Air. They are by far the worst company, aviation and otherwise I have ever encountered. On the way back to Kathmandu, we had tickets from the company but they had no record of us on the flight manifest... I would 100% recommend not flying with them if possible!! This however, was no fault of Nepal Eco Adventure, Chhatra tried his hardest to help us throughout. Without his help I imagine I would still be stuck in Lukla 4 months later!! The trek itself (Everest Base camp with one pass) was such a positive challenge. One of the hardest physically and mentally challenging things I have done but so worth every ounce of effort! The scenery cannot really be described in words, amazing, and you meet some awesome people during your travels there. To summarize, Nepal Eco Adventure was great. Chhatra, our guide Ram and our porters were all fantastic. It is diffidently one of the more affordable companies but does not lack in quality services. Do not fly Goma Air!! With the exception of that.... AMAZING !! Thanks to all at Nepal Eco Adventure :)"

I contacted Chhatra and he was professional, knowledgeable, and very quick to respond. He was able to accommodate our group for the dates we wanted at a great price, and was able to advise on logistics and gear. All safety concerns were addressed beforehand, so we arrived in Nepal ready for an amazing adventure.Throughout the trek, the guides and porters were incredible. They made sure we were all well fed and had everything we needed for a great trip. I had the unfortunate situation of becoming sick early on in the trek. I had terrible gastric issues followed by symptoms of acute mountain sickness and, in the end, needed to be heli-rescued from the Everest region (Note: this is rare- so don't let that deter you!). The guides Ramesh and Nik monitored me the whole time and put my wellness as their priority. I was taken to a hospital in Kathmandu where Ramesh and Chhatra checked in with me regularly and made sure I was okay. After I recovered in hospital, I now had a few days free, so Chhatra helped me arrange a side trip with Ramesh to Pokhara and Australian Camp to view the Annapurna Mountain Range at sunrise. All to say, the care and consideration from Chhatra and his team were there the entire time I was in Nepal, and they made sure my trip would be a memorable one despite having to cut the trek short.If you're looking for prompt and attentive correspondence; very experienced and personable guides; and a team with a high level of service who makes your health and safety their main priority, then I definitely recommend booking with Nepal Eco Adventure. You will not be disappointed."

The experience of a lifetime and I felt so proud to have achieved my goal & climbed to the tower at Nakarkot.

The walk itself was phenomenal, there aren't enough adjectives to describe how beautiful it is up there!

The trek itself was absolutely amazing (one that anyone who enjoys getting out in the wilderness should definitely consider doing this in their lifetime). I am very satisfied that I booked this through Nepal Eco Adventure. The owner - Chhatra - is a wonderful human being. Throughout my entire time in Nepal (one month) I visited Chhatra multiple times, choosing to use him for other adventures (Chitwan, Pokhara) after completing the trek. I'll try and summarize the reasons I would recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to others: Safety: Chhatra was always prompt in replying to any emails I sent him and incredibly helpful with all my questions and concerns. Chhatra connected us with a guide who has extensive knowledge of Sagarmatha National Park (has summited 6000m+ peaks, 16 years experience guiding, etc.) and provided an Blood-Oxygen Saturation Meter for us to help alleviate any concerns we had with AMS or our safety in general. I always felt that we were safe throughout the trek. Hospitality: Chhatra picked me up/dropped me off from the airport (saving me from the throngs of eager taxi drivers when I arrived around midnight) and ensured I got checked into my hotel after hours. Whenever I visited his office, he always had time to talk with me about my questions, experiences about the places I visited/planned to visit in Nepal, offering suggestions and recommendations. His english is very good, he's personable and it was easy to talk to him.Value:There are many trekking companies that head to EBC and they range in cost and quality. I was very happy with all that Nepal Eco Adventure offered for the price. They even go the extra step in providing down jackets, sleeping bags and trekking poles for those that need them.I can't wait for the chance to travel back to Nepal. Thanks again to Nepal Eco Adventure for making it such a special experience. I hope to see you again in the future."

My friend and I contacted Chhatra from Australia and he did a fantastic job organising our itinerary to fit in with our travel plans. From the moment we landed in Kathmandu, we were well looked after by Chhatra. He not only sorted our accommodation in Kathmandu, but set about organising an amazing trek to Langtang National Park and Gosaikunda Lakes. He introduced us to our guide and porter Dawa and Irra, who were to become good friends by the end of our two weeks together (and fierce competitors in card games- Dhumbal)! We saw the most amazing scenery everyday, but it was really the Nepali people who made our trip so special. Thank you to Dawa for being the ever social 'Red Panda' and introducing us to so many people on our walks. Thank you to Irra who not only carried our bags, but patiently taught us some Nepalese language along the way. Chhatra did an amazing job in organising our trek, and we look forward to returning to Nepal for another trek with Nepal Eco Adventure in the future. For anyone travelling to Langtang, you will read in Lonely planet about the long bus trip (9hr) to travel 120km. They are not kidding. We caught the public bus to Syabrubesi to start our trek, which took over 9 hours with a lot of bumps and upset tummies along the way. For the way home from Dhunche we opted to pay the extra money for a jeep which took about 4.5hrs. Thanks to Dawa and Chhatra for organising this, it is well worth spending the money. The cost of a jeep is 10 000 Rupees and comfortably seats 7 people + driver. We found many travellers willing to share the cost of the jeep. We highly recommend this, as the public bus is over-crowded with people, goats and chickens; and is subject to many stops by the local police/military for some time as bags are searched. Nepal is an amazing country, I am already looking forward to my next trip."

Like so many others, I found Chhatra extremely responsive, friendly and knowledgeable. He patiently answered all questions both via email before arrival and in his office before and after the trek. He also provided a great set of walking sticks as my sister hadn't brought her own.On the trail, our guide was Ramesh and I can't say enough great things about him. He's worked as a guide for 15 years and his experience shows. His knowledge, patience and kind demeanour were all so much appreciated. I always felt very safe as a female traveller and he was an excellent sport when asked for \"protection\" from the odd goat, buffalo or spider! He was also happy to talk as we trekked but provided plenty of space for us to do our own thing.One thing of particular value was that we were permitted to customise our trip once on the trail. Upon getting to Jomson after all the days of peaceful trekking, it became clear that walking on the hot, dusty road was not going to be much fun. I proposed hopping the bus to Tatopani and instead spending those days trekking in the Annapurna Sanctuary - and that was what Ramesh ensured we did. That level of flexibility just made the trip and ensured we enjoyed our whole time on the trail.Lastly, our porter was well equipped for the trail, personally known to Chhatra and compensated properly which was important to us.I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure, Chhatra and Ramesh - all contributed to an amazing first time trekker's experience and I will be travelling with them again when returning to trek Everest in years to come.Tip: When you arrive at the airport you will be swarmed by men trying to carry your bags. Resist! Your guide and driver will take of you and you will avoid dealing with an aggressive group looking for outrageous tips.  "

            "review": "An excellent trekking agency. I had a great experience with Nepal Eco Adventures, trekking to Everest Base Camp and the Gokyo Lakes (with two additional days sightseeing in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur), and enjoying a wildlife safari in the Chitwan National Park.With so many other tour agencies in Kathmandu, it is difficult to choose who to go with, but I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventures.Chhatra is extremely welcoming, trustworthy, and well-organised. He was very attentive and always full of good humour. From his introductory email to my last few hours in Kathmandu, Chhatra answered every question promptly and in good detail, going out of his way to provide the smoothest experience possible. Chhatra provides a personalised and friendly service that's excellent value for money. I wouldn't hesitate to use his company again or recommend it to others.Truly, the Everest Base Camp and Gokyo Lakes trek was one of the best experiences of my life. Our guide was Ram who was brilliant throughout; easy-going, very friendly, always ready to joke and laugh, but professional, very hardworking, reassuring and encouraging too. He answered our every question about the trek, about life in the mountains and Nepali culture, and was always at hand with facts about the Himalayas and its many mountains. Having never been on a trek before, I was glad we had Ram to guide us. We had no worries, just time to enjoy the beautiful views.Having spent hours researching this trek online, I am surprised that so many other groups trek to Gokyo first, before crossing the Cho La Pass to base camp. I'm glad Eco Adventures took the eastern route first. Not only is the route a safer choice for altitude acclimatisation, the scenery ascending to base camp via Tengboche and Dingboche is far more spectacular. It also makes crossing the challenging Cho La Pass more manageable, going down the steep western side rather than struggling up it. The scenery going down from Gokyo was beautiful too, but less dramatic, and the journey down takes less time than going up. I was glad to spend more time dwarfed by the snow-capped mountains.I'm a person of average fitness, but believe most people would enjoy this trek. There is no pressure to go beyond your ability, just take your time and enjoy. Do it and you will not regret it!"

He has excellent leadership and organisation skills, excellent English and is fun to be with. Chhatra took our group on a sightseeing trip around Kathmandu, 6 day trek from Jiri to Junbesi (the original Everest route), helicopter flight back to Jiri, white water rafting, elephant safari where we saw rhino, crocodile spotting in dugout canoes and exotic bird watching in the jungle of Chitwan National Park. As if that wasn't enough to pack into 2 weeks, we ended with an early morning unforgettable sightseeing flight to Everest from Kathmandu.Chhatra organised all accommodation, food, transfers etc. On his treks he uses well equipped porters all personally known to him who are paid more generously than many of the workers from other trekking companies. I have no hesitation on recommending Chhatra as a competent, knowledgeable and friendly individual who ensures you have a positive experience travelling in the amazing country of Nepal."

When I met Chhatra, I could not help to feel skeptical and felt a little scared given my experience already in Kathmandu. I was NEVER more wrong!!! He turned out to be the best surprise of our trip. He was friendly, engaging, honest, helpful, and kind. Not only that, he went out of his way to help us after our trek to Annapurna. This guy is incredible. He gave us everything we wanted. He made us feel comfortable, supported, engaged, and most of all excited about our trip. We are hoping some day to return as I keep telling my significant other I want to return. I can guarantee you that we will be looking up Chhatra and his company to help us with our trek needs. You won't be sorry!!!"

For some reason, those two things go hand-in-hand. Everyone always asks me,\"Where was the best place you've ever traveled?\" I have a few places that will remain close to my heart, and Nepal is absolutely on that list. People then ask, \"Why?\" Well, it's easy to say that Nepal is serenely beautiful and there is just something very special about the way this place made me feel. But I've learned from my travels that my 'favorite' places were better judged by the company I shared the experience with. Positive energy is something you cannot 'pay' for, but greatly enriches your experience.

Chhatra, the owner of the company, was very helpful in helping me organise the trek, making sure I had all the right gear before the trek and was a great friend too after the trek. He's actually the nicest, funniest most generous person ever. My guide was Siva who was also fantastic. It was just him and I and he always made sure I was feeling good and made sure I was included in conversations with local peoples and teahouse owners. Siva also taught me lot's of Nepalese language and taught me lot's about the culture, history and surrounding mountains which I would not have learnt had I not been with him and greatly enhanced my trekking experience. I did the Annapurna Circuit Trek, walking the entire way from Besisahar to Nayapul. Siva was very flexible and let me set the pace (walk more or less) in a day so we weren't tied to the itinerary. I was always happy with the accommodation choices Siva chose for us and he obviously knew where the best local lunch spots were!I felt very safe at all times (safety was a concern of my parents because I was a young female travelling alone) because of Siva and Chhatra's professionalism, trekking experience, loyalty and kindness. I felt the price was excellent value for the hospitality, guide service, food, accommodation, transport and the whole experience I received. I did not feel like a 'customer', but was treated like a guest and friend. I would definitely recommend Chhatra and his company Nepal Eco Adventure Treks to any person or group looking to go trekking in Nepal and I will definitely go with Nepal Eco Adventure again."

He also offered great advice based on our preferences. Chhatra sorted out our internal flights to Pokhara and even booked us an early morning Everest scenic flight. When the flight didn't take off, he assisted in us getting all the money back quickly and efficiently. During the trek itself, Chhatra was our guide. He was great to be around and really helped us get a good understanding of the local culture and customs in the villages we stayed in. I really did get so much out of our holiday and for that I must thank Chhatra and his insight and advice.I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure if you are looking for a safe, reliable and professional trekking company to the Himalaya."

I saw Nepal Eco Adventure online, did some research, and emailed Chhatra, the owner of the company. Chhatra was prompt, extremely thorough in answer questions and making suggestions to fit my criteria of a 14+ day trek with a few high points to climb. I ended up booking a trek tailored specifically to my dates through Langtang National Park, Gosainkunda lake region, the Helambu valley and Nagarkot, followed by a night in Bhaktapur, a beautiful city near Kathmandu. Chhatra was very clear on what was included in the program so there was no confusion and he even picked me up at the airport and dropped me off when I left. Chhatra runs a very thorough and intelligent company, plus he was a guide himself, so he understands the other side of trekking, so you end up with a company owner who understands the intricacies of all sides of this business. Chhatra found another person to help drop the costs on my end and quickly set up a porter to help the woman with her bag. Our guide, Jiba, was very experienced and knowledgeable. The accommodation was nice and the food was good and plentiful. Whenever I come back with the intention of using a guide, I will contact Chhatra only. I fell in love with Nepal on my trip and for good reason. Before I even left, I was trying to figure out what my next Nepal adventure would look like."

            "review": "Trip of a lifetime!. Hi, my review is long, but I hope you\u2019ll agree, worth the read. Chhatra at Nepal Eco Adventure was my guide for an unforgettable 23 day trek, last March, from Giri to Gokyo, Cho La Pass and finally onto Everest Base Camp, then back to Lukla for our flight back to Katmandu. On arrival, I was greeted at Katmandu airport with a friendly face and reassurance that Chhatra would look after me while in Nepal. We had previously been in contact by mail and I\u2019d felt I knew him before we had meet from his mail correspondence. Chhatra organized the accommodations in Katmandu, as well as each night along the trek, all the necessary visas into the parks etc. I had a fairly rough idea of where I wanted to visit along the trek, before reaching the main goal of Everest Base Camp as the highlight. I had a few last minute supplies to pick up before the trek and Chhatra was very helpful taking me around Katmandu to pick these up as well as a tour of Katmandu\u2019s main attractions the day I arrived and more attractions following the 23 day trek. Day 1 comprised of an 8 hour mini-bus twisty ride to Giri. It was a good experience, enjoying the local daily on-goings as well as providing an intro to Nepalese life, while providing a buildup to starting the trek. Along the trek, Chhatra was very informative of the surrounding village\u2019s main attractions, local mountains etc. and any local info that was worth mentioning. I did have a porter and felt a little guilty at times, but Chhatra reassured me that I was providing employment in the area. We stopped off at Chhatra\u2019s parent\u2019s village for a night to meet up with his family and see the various local projects, which Chhatra helped secure the financial backing for and helped with securing local labor, providing jobs for the local community. One of the many projects in his village was a new school, built from the financial help of a Scottish group which Chhatra guides on a frequent basis over the years. I have to say that Chhatra is a friend that\u2019ll watch your back, tend to your every need and provide the upmost service that you require on a once in a lifetime trip, that you won\u2019t forget. If you want to experience Nepal at its best from a trekker\u2019s point of view, I\u2019d highly recommended starting your trek from Giri, if you can afford the time. It\u2019s also a great way to acclimatize your body to the altitude. This is similar to the route that Sir. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay took while on their way to conquer Mt. Everest, so you\u2019ll be walking the route that\u2019s been part of history for the past 60 plus years. For the first week of the trek, I only saw/met a handful of trekkers. It wasn\u2019t until we joined the main route to EBC, that within the first hour, I\u2019d saw at least 100 tourist trekkers. Starting the trek from Jiri gave me more of an appreciation of the Nepalese locals and scenery, away from any tourists. A majority of the trekkers are in the 50 \u2013 70 year range. This must be due to the fact, that this type of trek is a once in a life time trek for them, or on their so called bucket list. You\u2019ll notice a majority of them won\u2019t make it all the way to EBC, due to altitude sickness. The route can vary from, normal hill walking to steep hill trekking. We passed by the famous Gokyo lakes and climbed the 5,000 plus meter Gokyo RI mountain peak the following day for a fantastic view of Mt. Everest and local glacier. The only deviation from the trek was that we could not trek over the Cho-La-Pass due to heavy snow blocking the route. This wasn\u2019t an issue, we just took an alternate route and kept on schedule. The alternate route was just as impressive. I was glad that Chhatra kept my safety in mind.You can build in rest days, which is recommended, not only for rest, but to visit local sites while acclimatizing. Chhatra will help you tailor your trek to your liking and time constraints, but you can\u2019t predict the weather at times, but Chhatra kept us on schedule. My trek started on Feb 28th 2013, for 23 days and had no major issues with the weather apart from the odd rain and snow shower. The trek is very manageable, but you do need to be fit. The Giri-Gokyo-Cho La Pass and finally Everest Base Camp trek will guarantee you fantastic and unforgettable views along the way, especially of the mountain peaks the higher you get. The snow covered hills and mountains can be surreal at times, with Everest and surrounding mountain reaching up to 8,000 meters. As soon as we reached our daily destination, Chhatra was on the case of organizing my room for the night. Before he and the porter got their room, I\u2019d have my bags in my room and the low down on the t-house, regarding the shower and meals available. All you need to do for the night is pick a good book and put your feet up, chat and plan your next day\u2019s route.When my wife came to visit me following the EBC trek, I booked a separate trek, again through Nepal Eco Adventures, with Chhatra and the porter to Phoonhill, to witness an unforgettable sunrise. She was feeling a bit under the weather at the time, but Chhatra stayed by her side for the duration of the 3 day trek. No matter how long the trek took, Chhatra stayed with her and treated her with the utmost respect, which we are very grateful. Chhatra and his guides will help you sculpt the trek you\u2019ve always dreamed of, focusing on your schedule and objectives from your bucket list trek. He\u2019s a very trustworthy guide and companion. He speaks fluent English and is very knowledgeable of the routes and locals along the way. You\u2019ll enjoy amazing hikes each day, where you can get into in-depth conversations with Chhatra or he\u2019ll leave you walk away, while you listen to your favorite tunes or eBooks.There\u2019re plenty of trekking companies out there, but I can\u2019t recommend Chhatra and Nepal Eco Adventure Ltd highly enough to book your next trip with. His rates are very competitive, but companionship, trust and most of all an unbelievable guide, which is priceless away from home. I hope you book your next trip with Chhatra\u2019s company and have the unforgettable trip as I did.All the best,Pat."

My guide was Chhatra Karki, he was more than great, professional, helpful andreally experienced. I wasn't sure what it would be like to do a trek like this on my own as a young female traveler, but Chhatra made me feel comfortable and seemedto intuitively know when I needed help and when I needed space. I felt very safe throughout and he explained me very interesting things about nature and culture.It felt like trekking with a friend I know a long time, which was great. Chhatra knew so much people in the teahouses along the way and he had a good relationshipwith all the people there. Everyday he was open and flexible for my ideas, we did some great and isolated side trips and everyday was an adventure. The highlight was the peak day on Kala Patthar with sunrise behind the Mount Everest in the early morning. The trip was one of the best things I ever did and their could have been no better company and guide for me to organise that!After coming back to Kathmandu, Nepal Eco Adventure organised a relaxing trip to Chitwan National Park to do some Elephant Back Safaris and to watch Rhinos in the jungle anda trip to Pokhara. Within this time of the side trips they organised my Indian Visa and everything worked out perfectly.The whole stay in Nepal was well organised and just awesome, I cannot recommend this company enough!I felt safe all the time and I can recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to all females who want to travel alone.Highly recommended to all people who want to explore Nepal in an authentic and amazing way!"

We had contemplated doing the Annapurna circuit on our own, but ultimately decided to go with a guide--great decision. Our guide (Shiva) was fantastic--excellent English and a lot of fun! Chhatra (owner, trek coordinator) was extremely responsive and accommodating--very knowledgeable and genuinely a great guy. We made several last minute changes to our trip and he was able to work them out without delay. We will definitely recommend Nepal Eco Adventures to friends and family and will most certainly use them again when we return to trek the Langtang region."

I\u00b4ve been in nepal in 2005 and was completely overwelmed by its beauty and peace. it took me some time to convince my lady, cause she was not that much in trekking. so i decided to arange a guided tour with nepel eco adventures and it worked out great. Transport and equipment and all this outher stuff around were perfectly organised and chhatra our guide took so much care about us. with his clear english he could give us an extensive introduction to country and people. Lang Tang during beginning spring was amazing with its rich colours and the warmth of the people. Threre were just a few outher tourists around during that time which made it even more peaceful. i can highly recommend chhatra and his crew for doing reliable service and giving a familiar feeling."

As Chattra is Nepalise, he was able to tell us a a lot about the Nepalise culture. He is passionate about where he comes from and shared this passion with us.Chaattra is very funny and really kind.

I have used Nepal Eco Adventure three times in the last four years, travelling with two of my sons on one occassion (Annapurna Circuit), a group of friends (Makalu Base Camp) and a couple of months ago a solo trip(the high passes of the Everest region)This company have the versatility to organise a remote camping trek or just ensure that one gets the most from the Teahouses routes. Whatever it is you have in mind the Guide will have excellent English and the ability to ensure you are aware of all that you are seeing around you, particularly the cultural aspects of whatever region you are travelling in. The customer service ethos is strong and there is an empathy with a western client that results in their willingness to show off the full glory of Nepal.Both Guides and Porters have a willingness to interact - so expect to trade knowledge and opinions about the West - and lots of banter! They are a hardworking company that want to see you again and that shows in everything they do."

The first time was in the Annapurna region, over the ThrongLa Pass. Back then Chhatra was the lead guide and I knew then, that should I return to Nepal, I would like to trek with him again. I am lucky enough to have returned and this time used Chhatra's very own company, Nepal Eco Adventure. I am delighted that Chhatra Karki has made this progression as he certainly deserves to do well. My second trip was to EBC. All my airport transport was well organised and even though my flight was delayed, Nepal Eco Adventure (NEA) waited for me to arrive. Accommodation in Kathmandhu was organised for me and was very good as well as some of the friendliest lodges along the trek. NEA arranged other side trips for me to participate in. These included a jaw dropping trip to the Temples in Bhaktapur and a relaxing stay in the national park at Chitwan where I was able to observe Rhino in their natural environment and many species of birds as well as crocodiles and elephants. Back in the mountains, after each days trekking, I was able to enjoy a short, interesting talk about the area, culture and religions of Nepal. I always received excellent advice on health and safety and felt very well looked during both my trips. Finally, two further reasons why I would only trek with NEA and Chhatra Karki. He pays his porters a proper wage without fleecing westerners, unlike some of the larger western companies and on my last trip I suffered with altitude sickness but NEA got me down quickly and safely. While I was recovering back in Namche Bazaar I witnessed another trekker being helicoptered out with HACE. My family will always be grateful to Chhatra and his company for getting me down safely and recognising early enough how sick I was becoming. I owe Chhatra and his company such a lot. I cannot recommend this company enough. I had so much fun with NEA, Chhatra and all his porters, I cannot imagine trekking with anyone else."

This is NOT the case with Nepal Eco Adventure; every rupee counts towards an authentic, honest and eye-opening experience. After some months in Kathmandu me and a group of friends decided to walk the Annapurna Circuit and luckily found Nepal Eco Adventure and Chhatra Karki. Chhatra was our guide for the 20+ day trek, and knew the circuit like the back of his hand. Speaking fluent English, Chhatra had answer for all of our questions, and often a story to go with them. He was as chatty and affable as he was serious and alert, and wherever we went, Chhatra always seemed to know where to stay and who to talk to. We would often talk during the course of the trek and once it was over we all felt that we had gained a friend as well as having shared a wonderful experience.No matter the trail that you decide to walk, choose Nepal Eco Adventure and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Highly recommend."

From the moment I met Chhatra in Katmandu to the final farewell I had a wonderful experience. I did the trip with a female friend and even though I had contemplated doing a self guided tour I made the right decision to get a guide. It made everything so easy from explaining menu's, paying for things, knowing the best places to stay/eat and of course local history and a great interest in his environment and global matters also. Excellent English with even a hint of a Scottish accent from his yearly Scottish HIkes. Chhatra is a very genuine guy and I'd have a drink with him as easy here in Ireland as in Katmandu. Down to earth, open and intelligent. I'd have no problem recommending Nepal Eco Adventures to anyone and if you'd like you can PM me and I can discuss costs/Annapurna/times etc. I also did a 3 day Chitwan National Part package with NEO.

Having trekked to Everest Base Camp in Khumbu, Nepal with Nepal Eco Adventure, I cannot recommend them enough.A local company using only local staff, the guides and porters are of the highest quality, with a rarely seen zest and contentment in their work. My guide had an enormous amount of experience, was deeply knowledgeable and was better equipped than any of the guides you will find in the mountains. The team were naturals at their work and extremely professional in their duties, and really made the difference on this trek \u2013 making a great trip into a truly unforgettable experience.The trip was absolutely incredible and I would encourage any able-bodied and properly-equipped individual who is considering it to go for it \u2013 from the chaos and diversity of KTM to the landing at Lukla to the endless 6000m+ mountain vistas and the unique landscape of base camp and the approaching glacier, which is like an alien planet. There are too many great things to experience and remember about this trip, is was a complete sensory overload. Things went pretty much as expected, I had planned to go to EBC, then over Cho-la and Renjo-la Passes and back down through to Lukla via Thame. However after EBC we reached Dzonghla, which is the only stopping place before crossing the path, only to experience heavy snow overnight making it too difficult to make the pass so we had to head back. That was disappointing but freak unusual weather can occur anytime.I would use Nepal Eco Adventure's services again without question. I saw many guides, some of which were substandard and didn\u2019t really do anything more than the minimum required, their customers were complaining but I did not have a single thing to complain about. The service started as soon as I arrived in Kathmandu and lasted for the complete duration of my trip, despite some large changes of plan during the trip. They have plenty of solid international references, which checked out very well and having used them I now add myself to that list of references, please feel free to contact me direct if you need any further information. Using Nepal Eco Adventures is the only way to trek the Himalaya - you will be provided with sincere support from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave; you will experience a deep sense of local life and culture which many trekkers do not see; you will have the best photos of your trip; you will be contributing only to directly to the people of this wonderful country. It is 100% guaranteed."

My friend found Mountain Mart Treks on TripAdvisor due to all its wonderful reviews, and after completing our trip with them on Oct. 19, I can also attest to their wonderful services! Their Managing Director, Dolakh, communicated all the necessary information for the trip and quickly answered any questions we had via email. The packing list they provided was very helpful--it definitely helped me figure out, and narrow down, what to bring. And I love how MMT offers the option to use their down sleeping back and/or jacket for the trip, as well as a duffle bag to be used on the trek.Since the day arrived in Kathmandu, MMT took really great care of us. Our arrival was delayed due to weather and we didn't get in until midnight, but our driver Bishnu and our guide Prem was waiting patiently for us and promptly got us to our hotel. MMT put us up at Hotel Apsara and they also provided great service--despite the kitchen being closed at midnight, they still allowed us to order some chow mein for dinner and it was really good!Our guide Prem came by the next day to take us to the MMT office to meet Dolakh, settle our balance, and get a sleeping bag and our duffle bags. Dolakh also was able to exchange money for us at a great rate.Prior to our EBC trek, we did have one extra day we used to tour Kathmandu for the day. We were picked up by the same driver who picked us up from the airport, Bishnu, and he was really patient and wonderful as he drove us throughout the city to visit 4 temples.For our EBC trek, everything went so smoothly! We really got lucky with the weather. We were able to fly in and out of Lukla with no issues, and our guide Prem and porter Sudip were wonderful! They both took really good care of us on the trek. BTW, I really appreciate the fact that MMT is willing to keep the travel groups small--I truly felt like they were invested in making sure we had a great trek, and that it was NOT about the money. I was the slowest in the group but I really appreciate how Prem would tell us \"bistarai, bistarai\"--\"slowly, slowly\", assuring me that it was ok that I was slow and that we would still make the next village in good time. And we always did! And our porter Sudip? I am amazed at how he seemed to carry our 20 kg duffle bags with no issue all throughout the trip! In fact, I'm just amazed with all the porters, as well as the local Nepalese who carried heavy loads of supplies between villages throughout the trek.I wasn't expecting much with the accommodations throughout the trek but I was pleasantly surprised. The walls are thin in all the tea houses, and the rooms got smaller as we got closer to EBC, but they all provided comfy beds with clean sheets and blankets. We were able to have private bathrooms until Namche Bazaar but we did switch to shared bathrooms for most of the trek. And all the tea houses provided meals that were included in our package. Prem and Sudip served us our meals and helped us eat what we couldn't finish. :) They also made sure that we had treated water every night and every morning. Prem also checked our resting heart rate and oxygen saturation each night, and often asked us how we were feeling on the trek. I really appreciated Prem checking in on how we were feeling.One additional thing Prem did that I really appreciate was that he helped get a cake for my friend in Tengboche for her birthday. He even was willing to pay a share of it, which was sweet but I insisted I would pay for it all.Prem was overall just a great guide. We were really lucky to have him on the trek. He made sure we had all we needed, he answered all our questions, and he was funny and easy to get along with.The EBC Trek was probably the hardest thing I've done in my life, but I'm so glad I did this with MMT because they were so supportive. They definitely do all they can to make sure the trek is a success. And their prices? I don't think you can get a better deal! I mean, we got our own driver to and from the airport as well as for our Kathmandu city tour, we got our flights to and from Lukla, and all our meals and lodging on the EBC trek were included. And the price they offered was the lowest among the trekking companies we looked at!I would HIGHLY recommend doing the EBC trek with MMT! I've already recommended them to all my family and friends who may be interested!MMT - Thank you so much for an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime trip!"

He arranged for us to meet our guide that afternoon and insisted that we should be happy before booking. We were ready to start our trek the following day (in the middle of Nepalese national holidays!). Our guide, Makar, and porter, Raj, were excellent. Makar was very knowledgable and ensured we were staying in the best guesthouses at each stop, booking in advance if it was required. They were both so kind, helpful and nothing was too much for them. We had great fun in the evenings as well, chatting and playing cards - exchanging Nepalese and English games - and they became good friends.Makar even came to our hotel to ensure we had the right clothing and equipment before commencing our trek. Dalakh kindly leant us a down jacket, sleeping bag and poles for the trek. Everything was included - breakfast, elevenses, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner. We ordered as much as we desired and always had full stomachs. The snacks (chocolate, cookies, fruit) were envied by our fellow trekkers using other companies. He even supplied a first aid kit, with Diamox (which we didn't need to use), analgesia etc.The circuit itself was amazing. We adjusted our itinerary for the last few days and Dalakh was kind to accommodate. He even arranged an airport transfer for us after we got back (for free). It is difficult to choose travel agents in Kathmandu but we genuinely think this company would be among the best. We felt we got good value for money and would not hesitate to book again!!"

The accommodation was basic, but nice - we were definitely staying in the better tea houses in each village. And the food was fantastic!Most of all however, our guide and porter (Ram and Padam) continually went out of their way to make sure everything was going well, and ensured we had an amazing trip from beginning to end.If you're looking to book the EBC trek (or any other trek in Nepal) through an agency, I can't recommend Mountain Mart strongly enough. Highly professional, and they'll make sure you're well looked after the entire time."

From a sea-level dweller at 20,300ft - thank you Tenjing Sherpa for your expert guidance!These guys were incredible with our Island Peak & Everest Base Camp Trek!Pre-departure communication and information was really clear and timely.Dolakh was highly informative and ensured that all arrangements were in place for our arrival.We had a last minute travel change which was handled exceptionally efficiently by the company. Everything was seamless and we did not have to concern ourselves with any logistics.From hotel transfers to local tours and Khumbu Region treks - all were arranged to a high level.Accommodation at the tea houses as with all treks become more limited with increased altitude. However, we received the best available at remote locations - and we even had wifi! Safety at no time was ever compromised.I'd give them a big old rating of 110/100!"

From us picking up, to booking all our hotels might i say they picked the best kathmandu had to offer, they were very polite, friendly and they did everything we asked and more. Even when the lukla flight was cancelled on the 1st day for bad weather they pulled out all the stops and re-arranged if needed another trek to pokahara, lucky for us the flight went next day. Our guide yukumar was the best, he looked after me like i was his sister when i fell ill on the trek, and even arranged a helicopter back from lukla to kathmandu when the weather changed on the way out. they chauffered us around kathmandu to visit temples waited for us, we had a meal with dolakh and his lovely wife chatting about family, england nepal and politics lol. We spend 3 weeks with these lovely people and my dream is to visit them next year for another trip,"

EBC trek is definitely one you can do on your own, but MMT had all of our transportation, lodging, meals, permits, and most importantly, flights to/from Lukla taken care of, which is no small task. We had Prem as our guide and he was great. Knew all of the mountains, knew the trek very well, and was always making sure we had everything we needed. Ask him to teach you some local card games (bring cards or other games!). There are definitely bigger companies out there offering similar treks (i.e. REI), but MMT holds their own and at a much lower price (plus you're supporting a local business). I would not hesitate to use MMT again or recommend to friends/family. This is a trip I had been wanting to take for a good 10 years and it did not disappoint."

And when indifferent weather presented us with problems at the start of our trek he made alterations effortlessly.

He appreciated that holiday time is valuable, listened to what we wanted and ensured that no time was lost for any reason. Thankyou for everything!Our mountain guide Kumar was brilliant. Nothing was any trouble for him and he looked after us amazingly. We made a nice group and I would love to hike in the Himalayas again with you one day. I am sure we will.And the company driver Bishnel was a delight to spend time with. A very talkative person who somehow manages to navigate his way through the traffic of Kathmandu effortlessly whilst pointing out the sights. Very punctual even in the small hours of the mornings.I will not hesitate to book my next trip to Nepal with Mountain Mart Treks and I am very much looking forward to that day.

            "review": "Annapurna Base Camp Trek. The experience with travel begins with the arrangements and competency of the company organizing the trip (in this case trek). Originally, our vacation was planning to do the Everest Base camp (EBC) under a 12-day trek. However, Mother Nature changed the original itinerary. Doing EBC is all about getting into Lukla and sometimes the weather does not cooperate for several days. Our plan for EBC was abandoned since all flights into Lukla weer canceled for several days and lost our rest days for acclimatization. Mountain Mark (headed by Dolakh) deftly managed our expectations and suggested that Annapurna trek be completed instead. It was not a disappointment. Our guide (Tilak) and porter (Ram) were indispensable in making our trek very comfortable over a 10 day period. The guide watched over our needs during and after our daily hikes. Both guide and porter would cater to us during off times (meals, evenings). Making sure our dinner was ordered and arranging places to sleep in various tea houses. The visual beauty of the ABC trek more than offset the disappointment of missing the opportunity of trekking Everest. The key days involving the morning hike up to Poon Hill and watching the sunrise over ABC were perfectly clear for fantastic photo opportunities. The trek itself was overall modest in terms of difficulty...just be able to walk up/done stairs for hours at a time (about 4-7 hours per day). Thank you Dolakh, Tilak and Ram for a memorable vacation. We be back to accomplish the Everesr Base Camp trek during the spring of 2018.One suggestion for those doing EBC. It might be worth the effort to book several days flights into Lukla (aka 1st flights). Once a cancellation occurs on flights into Lukla then one gets bumped into the 3rd or 4th flight the next day and so on. With limited vacation time, the odds of doing EBC diminishes unless weather is perfect."

However with all the companies out there in Kathmandu offering 'the best' it's hard to distinguish what was.... That was until we gave mountain mart treks a go. Right from the booking process whilst at home in England, dolakh (MD of company) added my wife on whatsapp and ensured everything was answered. Upon arrival in Kathmandu airport transfer was arranged to our hotel and then we went with our guide to mountain mart in downtown thamel to meet dolakh and finalise things before our big day! The next morning filled with excitement we had an early transfer to the domestic airport and our guide (Lochan) sorted everything for us. Flights from Kathmandu to Lukla can be very weather dependant and as such is out of control in terms of organising, but Lochan was always managing to be at the front of every queue and ensuring we were on the next flight! When we eventually arrived to lukla after cloudy weather all morning we met our porter Sanuvai whom can only be described as one of the strongest men I have ever met, him and Lochan always were very attentive to us and at meal times ensured we were looked after well! Mountain mart treks were the only company on our 12 day trek whom I saw who had a fully stocked first aid and drug bag (including the provision of diamox, cold and flu tablets, throat lozenges and any other drug you would need), as well as a pulse oximeter which was used every night after meal times to monitor oxygen saturations and pulse rates all of which were recorded by Lochan. Mountain mart treks pride themselves on good customer service and I can tell anyone whom is debating which company to use to go with mountain mart they went above and beyond and have exceeded any expectation I had. I will return to Nepal in the very near future and mountain mart treks will be the first company I will use for my treks, A big thank you to Lochan our guide, who provided a very knowledgable tour throughout our Everest base camp trek;Sanuvai (sudip) our porter whom worked tirelessly carrying out bags and looking after us at meal times; Dolakh for providing great hospitality and support in our planning and organising."

The path from Ulleri to Ghorepani to Poonhill is beautiful.

We both felt he really cared about making our trekking experiences as enjoyable as possible and about our wellbeing throughout our time in Nepal along with his great sense of humour and interesting knowledge of the area. I would highly recommend Prem, along with our porter Nabin, to anyone wanting to trek in Nepal.Mountain Marts service before and during our trip was excellent and very personal which made the trip to Nepal incredibly stress free throughout, which I don't think would have been the case without such exceptional service. I would however recommend to other travellers to ensure time for some flexibility around your trips and departure from Nepal, especially at this time of year, as we had quite an intense itinerary due to prebooked flights and this at times meant the trekking was much more intense than we thought it would be (sometimes arrow d 12 hours a day) and meant we had to slightly rush some parts of the trip and did not allow any time for hold ups so it is worth discussing this when arranging your trip.All round though a fantastic service and a company I would highly recommend."

Two days prior to commencement, I had two meets where all my questions were answered and was provided with any trekking gear I didn't already have! All equipment such as gloves and sleeping bags provided were great quality! I was luckily enough to trek by myself with local guide Lochant. Lochant was probably the funniest and most enthusiast person I've ever met! Full of energy ever day, always singing and dancing at night. Most nights we had the company of other Trekkers but when alone, Lochant did an excellent job at providing entertainment. Lochants knowledge of the trek, conditions and weather was beyond amazing! Each night he'd explain the next day's trekking path to amazing detail and answer and questions about steepness etc. As the altitude got higher, Lochant would continue to monitor myself and check for any altitude sickness symptoms. He definitely provided care to my self and had beyond adequate first aid supplies if needed (luckily wasn't needed). Any second we would have opportunities of good views, Lochant would be quick to request himself to take a photo of me-so I'm not short of photos. Lochants interactions with the locals also meant that our stays at well selected lodges went without dramas. Once the trek was over and we spent our last day together in Lukla, my flight was cancelled due to poor weather, Lochant arranged accommodation and flights and stayed with me for an extra day and didn't leave until my flight successful left. Where possible, Lochant and Mountain Mart picked accommodation with the best possible facilities such as hot showers and wifi if needed. Being the off season, little was open in most villages however Lochant was great at providing things to do. Having two acclimatising day-arranged by mountain mart, I felt no symptoms of acute mountain sickness and I was able to reach Everest Basecamp without feeling sick! I very much recommend have these days as the people we saw who didn't make it decided to skip acclimatising days. I very much recommend Mountain Mart and Lochant, I'll defiantly be coming back and using them. Small things such as providing chocolate bars and fresh fruit each day went far into providing excellent customer satisfaction. Despite the weather which was out of our control, I had the best experience with Mountain Mart, without any negatives. Even when times got stressful (when my flight to Lukla was cancelled) Lochant was able to provide excellent service and ensure I made it to Kathmandu. If you want to have an entertaining trek, I very much recommend Lochant!"

Look no further book with mountain mart treks!To be Honest I did not check the reviews before I stumbled open this office in Kathmandu. we spend half a day checking out EBC treking tours in Kathmandu the prices were very similar so we want to go with whoever offered the best service. I was immediately impressed by Mount mart treks. Their office is well presented the Manager Dolkah answered all our questions and queries directly and was very informative. Within 5 minutes we also met our Guide Prim. I wanted to meet our guide before we booked. he was very friendly and we got on well so we booked. Mountain mart offered us an all inclusive deal which included accommodation, water,snacks, chocolates, Tea and 3 meals a day this turned out to be very good value for money as it would have cost us more if we paid our selves. we averaged about 2/3000 rupees a day for food and Tea. The only thing i paid for on the trek itself was 3 bottles of coke and my sister had a shower at Lobuche which cost 1000 rupees! Absolutely no nickel and diming here and no hidden costs with Mountain Mart.The Trek its self was amazing. I myself have climbed Kilimanjaro before and I am used to altitude My sister has zero experience did minimum training or preparation (I told her to train before!) yet our guide Prim was experienced and set the perfect pace for both of us. Our guides timings were also very accurate! Lol this is Nepal but when he said 30 minutes more it really was 30 minutes more. Every morning our guide explained in detail what the day would entail and what to expect on the trek weather altitude gradient e.t.c another thing I liked about our guide was Im an amateur photographer so I like to stop suddenly, back track to get some yak pictures sometimes stray off the path and make everyone wait! But I did not feel any pressure at all from our guide or porter.The accommodation was acceptable and generally to a good standard dont expect the Hilton you came here to Trek! Guide supplied use with sleeping blankets and extra bedding when we needed it We got hot showers and electricity in our rooms up to Namche Bazar other Trekkers I spoke to did not have these facilities in their rooms.Our porter Lilet was amazing he catered to all our needs as best he could and I never caught him without a smile on his face! Try smiling while carrying 30kg using a head strap! Lilet also accompanied us on both our acclimatization day hikes and even all the way to the Base camp so he definitely went the extra mile.Bottom line I am 100% satisfied and I would definitely recommend Mountain mart Treks without hesitation as aspects of service were met or exceeded. Do your self a favour go straight to mount art and book your trip there when you arrive or email them you will save half a day shopping around! Then only thing they cant do is carry you up the Mountain, Though I'm sure Dolkah can arrange that if you asked!"

The first day was all we needed to see that they were serious about treating their clients with the best possible experience. All flights were cancelled that day but we were put on a helicopter, and the fee was paid by MM, so we were able to start our trek and stay on schedule. Our guide Kumar and porter Nabin were extreemly hard working and accomadating in every way possible and we enjoyed their company and all became a small family for two weeks. I wouldn't look at any other companies bc the prices are all similar and you stay at the same places and eat the same food. The only difference is the way you are treated, and MM treats you like family. Our next trek will certainly be with the Mountain Mart team."

The route was Gokyo valley, Chola pass, Everest basecamp and finally the climb of the Island Peak. Before choosing mountain mart I spoke to 5-7 other agencies in Kathmandu.Price /quality: I think the price level is just fair and right, not expensive and not low cost. I had no hidden costs. I booked an all inclusive package for the whole trek. If you only book the guide without accomodation and food you do not safe much. For me it was a great comfort not to worry or think about any expenses during the trek. I could always choose the meals out of the menu. One positve detail is that all mountain mart guides always have a well equipped first aid kid, including AMS tablets (Diamox). I have not seen this at other agencies. Guide: One of the key factors for a good trekking holiday in Nepal is a good guide. My guide was \"Raju Tamang\". I strongly recommend him, great person!!! His english is very good. He also has a high knowledge of the landscape/ nature, people and culture. He explained me many thinks. We also had lots of fun. Raju has a very good contact to the owners of the lodges. Therefore I always had some little extras, e.g. better rooms, food, ....I have to say... Thank you Raju and Dolakh for this great holiday!

Manaslu requires a special permit, which can only be obtained through a registered trekking agency. Therefore, you cannot do this trek on your own. But a guide and a porter make your life much easier anyways - in particular it is very helpful that the porter can carry extra gear. For the whole 15 days I have not met any other trekkers, which I enjoyed very much but if you are looking for more company, this is probably not the right trek. The trip was very well organized by Dolakh, though you should be aware that not everything runs perfectly smooth in such a rather remote area. In our case the next two lodges after crossing the Larkhe Pass were closed, which prolongated that day by approx. 5 walking hours. Therefore, if you are going in the off-season it might be advisable to specifically request that your group's arrival is being pre-announced (most lodges have telephone and can therefore be reached before arrival). I am pretty sure that they would come and open if a small extra fee is being offered. Due to that long day, we shortened the trek by 1 day and Dolakh was very flexible in getting the jeep to Besi Sahar one day earlier."

This process continued throughout the entire trek along with Lochan and Gokarna cracking jokes, telling us stories and also a lot of singing from Lochan. Along our trek we meet other trekkers who were all impressed with our guide and porter. The other trekkers keep saying your \"guides\" are very involved and we had informed them one of them was our porter (Gokarna). Everyone said the same thing that they rarely even seen their porters or even interacted with them, but to have him interacting with us was impressive.

Dolakh Thapa made all arrangements professionally, added with great hospitalities and a 5-Star customer service, from before I flew to Kathmandu, arriving there for briefing and checking (extremely important), to after the trek completed. It was impeccable. One note that this trek is very demanding and was meant for fit people, although I managed to complete it successfully as planned, albeit with additional trekking hours everyday. Also that it was much colder in winter. Now, the hero of my trek was none other than Kumar, my trekking guide, without whom I wouldn't be able to make it. He's a very trustworthy, strong, athletic, smart, resourceful young man who took care of me in every way possible. He's very experienced and know every nook and corner of this trek. Among other things, he would push me harder, motivate me, lighten up the mood by cracking jokes, help me in many dangerous and difficult paths. He would advised me on what to wear depending on weather, and at the end of the day, present a nice fruit platter, a very nice gesture. He made my journey enjoyable although I was dead tired. Now that I've completed the trek, I felt like a million dollar. A million thanks to Kumar, Dolakh Thapa, and Mountain Mart. I highly recommend them to anybody. My trek has ended, but the memories will last for a long long time. And I still hearing Kumar singing: \"Priya, Priya, oooh, Priya , Priya. Priya, Priya, oooh, Priya, Priya.\""

Prem and Nabin were my guide and porter and they took such great care of me. Every need was met where possible and every comfort provided. They were funny as well in addition to being kind and professional. I felt completely safe and well taken care of the whole way I was with them. I would recommend them to anyone who look for a reliable guide and porter and hope to minimize any hassle in their trip."

Thank goodness we were met by the smiling face of Lochan and his team. I have been planning this trip for years and years and wanted this trip to be perfect, just like I imagined. Thank goodness I chose Mountain Mart because, thanks to them...It was. The trip went seamless, all 12 days. Lochan made us feel like we were the only people on the trail and attended to every need and want. Him and his amazing cousin Gokarna who was our porter, held my hand my hand when I didnt think I could make it up Kala Patthar, they held my bag when I was sick with the Khumbu cough and they made sure that they held a place in our hearts :) Ill never forget them or this trip! Thank you Mountain Mart, Lochan and Gokarna for making our dreams come true. My suggestions for the trip...Pack extra socks, pack light, tip them good and listen to every thing your guide says, (your life is in their hands)."

I appreciated that they were willing to work with our itinerary and flexible to make our trip a great success when the unexpected (flight cancellations) occurred. I have been to Nepal before trekking to the Annapurna Sanctuary with another company. The other company did fine but Mountain Mart is better. I really liked that they set the cost and stuck with it. Little unexpected costs always come up, and when they did Mountain Mart covered those costs even when it would have been reasonable for them to pass those costs on to us.The guide Tilak was excellent. He was very knowledgeable, upbeat, positive and very patient. He was a pleasure to be with the entire trip. I would highly recommend him.Since returning I have recommended Mountain Mart and will continue to do so. They are professional, thorough, local, easy to work with and just good people. They are who I would use again and again...hopefully."

Each of my enquires were answered with details.On the day of my arrival, the guide Prem picked us up at the airport in the late evening and transferred us to the hotel. Then we also booked a private car for day trip within the city of Kathmandu. The car was comfortable. As for the trekking part, the transportations, itinerary, meals, accommodations - all of these were excellently arranged. Our guide Prem and the porter Nobin were very helpful. They would find the best lodges and restaurants for us. The mountain views was incredibly amazing. We went up to Poon Hill for sunrise and definitely worth a walk although you have to wake up very early in the chilly temperature. Eventually we ended our trip with a tourist bus back to Kathmandu. There was a bad traffic congestion. I would suggest others to take the air if budget allows. Last day we had a meal with the boss Dolakah. He was a really nice guy.Now I am planning to do the EBC and Island peak next year with their company!"

I found MMT to have all the required practical information I needed and a great price for what I was looking for (originally a 8 day trek to view Everest.) Upon my arrival in Kathmandu and speaking with Dolakh, I realized I had both the time and resources to make the 12 day trek to base camp a reality, so I went for it. Dolakh facilitated all the details and made sure I had the necessary gear I hadn't brought with me and off I went. Through a delay a 6 hour delay at Lukla airport due to weather, each day on the trail, tearing a ligament in my knee halfway through the trek, getting to Everest base camp and up to Kala Patthar and finally an emergency evacuation by helicopter back to Kathmandu, I was completely safe and very well taken care of. Every meal was always ordered ahead of time, I was encouraged to do day hikes on my acclimatization day, I met many beautiful people along the way, made lots of great friends and best of all fulfilled a huge bucket list item, to pay a visit to Everest Base Camp. My guides name is Kumar, a very kind, athletic young man with a great singing voice, who showed me a lot of patience and care through my painful knee injury and slow pace thereafter. What a journey, but one I couldn't have completed without Mountain Mart, Dolakh and Kumar, who went above and beyond the call of duty and base level of care for a relatively last minute client. When I say beyond the call of duty, I do truly mean that (Dolakh brought my personal items to the hospital in Kathmandu and drove me to the airport the day I left Nepal and Kumar came with me shopping in Namche Bazar to make sure I got all the warm clothing I needed last minute and then helped me to find a knee brace bandage in the interim.) They are wonderful people.I highly recommend!! You will have the best, most memorable experience! Good luck!"

I trekked with a friend of mine who never had been to Nepal and who did not have much trekking and walking experience. But the Poon Hill trekking is, although at some stretches hard because of the endless \"stairs\", not too demanding. It is a \"low altitude\" trekking. The little villages are all worth a visit and it tells a lot about the culture and way of life of the people living there. We stayed the night at nice lodges who were all used to have hikers. Good beds, good rooms, toilet inside the building, some even had a shower!!! The scenery of the Poon Hill trekking is very various and that's why we liked that trekking so much. Walking through forest, through nice villages, alongside riverbeds, and always the Annapurna peaks somewhere in the distance. Poon Hill itself was awesum!!!! Beautiful sunset, which made getting up in the early morning worthwhile!!! Again we chose Mountain Mart treks to be our trekking agency. I have done many trekkings with this company and they never let me down. Good, friendly guides who know their way around an who can tell much about the history and people of the mountains. Most guides are mountain men themselves and thus very used and familiar with mountain scenery, mountain dangers and mountain difficulties. On this trekking Mountain Mart provided us again a good guide who took care of us very well. Also the porter, a young man who did not speak English, tried his best to make contact which we appreciated very much. All and all it was a journey to never forget..because of the beautiful scenery, the nice compagny and knowledge of the guide, the characteristic villages and the good weather!!!! I recommend Mountain Mart very highly!"

I was traveling to Nepal to meet up with some medical colleagues to work at a hospital but we had a few weeks before to trek, and the Annapurna Circuit was the perfect length of time. One of the group members had done ABC trek the previous year with a guide, Rewati Parajuli. She recommended him to lead our current AC trek and so we contacted him. He was happy to lead our trek, my husband and I met him via email and were very impressed and convinced quite quickly despite doing a good bit of online research for trekking agencies. He was extremely accommodating and thoughtful via email, very organized and sent us a perfectly thought-out itinerary for the trek based on what we had communicated that we wanted, with room for flexibility, and for a very fair offer I might add. The day we arrived in Nepal, we met Rewati and went to Mountain Mart to cover the essentials and we couldn't have been happier with our choice. A great trekking agency focused on professionalism, safety, no hidden costs, and responsible tourism to start. Our trek had a few unforeseen complications (such as a lost passport which complicated things, but again Rewati handled the situation like a pro), and 10 days in, the massive April 2015 earthquake hit just a day after we passed Thorung La Pass. But through it all, our guide and 2 porters were phenomenal and honestly we commented so many times \"what would we have done without them?\" Rewati is the most kind and gracious person, extremely well connected within the trekking community and was able to navigate us to a safe place after the disaster. I highly recommend both our amazing guide to a group or solo traveler and also our two porters Ganesh and Komol who were extremely fun, attentive, and who work so well as a team with Rewati. We spent many nights laughing together playing card games, drinking tea, or just chatting and learning about local traditions in the villages and Nepal in general. After our trek, we were touched and so thankful to continue our relationship with Rewati as he so kindly assisted in helping us with logistics (that none of us Americans could perform well in a foreign country not speaking the language) related to transportation and lodging of volunteer medical relief workers when we arrived to Kathmandu. His assistance in networking our logistics during this critical time when he didn't even have a home to sleep in shows the dedication and caring nature of Rewati Parajuli. A big thanks to Rewati, Ganesh, and Komol for the best trek of my life, I hope to see you again in Nepal on those amazing mountains. Thanks to Mountain Mart for employing these great people."

Being my first trip to Nepal and first trekking adventure to high mountains, I have no slightest idea about Everest region at the time when I started trip planning few months prior to the intended departure date. Having done some online search, 3 trekking agencies was shortlisted by me. Frankly speaking, MMT was not my top choice initially, but after few email exchanges , Dolakh the MD, was quick to convince me with his professional presentation and personal attention to details. At age 66 and in average fitness, I was grateful to Dolakh when he made me a fair offer and a flexible itinerary totaling 22 days of solo trekking when my only 2 other buddies finally decided to drop out. The tailor-made itinerary included 3 prime destinations, i.e. EBC and Kala Patthar, plus Gokyo Lakes as an option. However, in view of unfavorable weather conditions and forecast, I decided to give up all three upon reaching Gorak Shep.Was I disappointed then ? Absolutely not ! Taking advantage of the flexible itinerary and being solo trekker, I opted to switch over to \"soft trekking\" from village to village, which I truly enjoyed after slowing down my pace and re-tuning my mindset. The 16 days trekking in Everest region is undoubtably a fantastic trip of a lifetime. The breathtaking scenery of towering snow mountains, the spectacular views along winding trails, the peaceful villages that nestle on rolling hills and valleys, the hospitality and cleanliness of lodges provided for overnight stays or for meals, the friendly and ever smiling Sherpa villagers, all these mosaic up a fond and lasting memory.Not forgetting to mention Lochan who was my guide/porter and an excellent trekking companion. He speaks fluent English and is a very cheerful, understanding and helpful person. He always stay within visible distance from me while on trekking and is most attentive in serving meals, drinks, fresh fruits and tidbits at lodges. On several occasions when the trail became too demanding on me, he never hesitate to offer taking over my backpack albeit a heavy load already on his back, He is well-liked friend not only to fellow guides and porters, but also to locals both in villagers and those passing-by. Lochan is indeed the super guide that I highly recommend to any potential trekker, be it on solo, or in group.Sadly, my wonderful trip came to an abrupt end at Kathmandu when a devastating 7.8 big earthquake hit Nepal. Luckily, I was safe, unhurt and managed to fly home despite flight delays. I was deeply touched when merely 2 days after the big quake, Dolakh came personally to pick me up and drove me to the airport, at a time when he was most needed for caring to his own family and members of his staff who were still enduring tremors from continuing aftershocks.A big \"thank you\" to Lochan, Dolakh and MMT !"

We have trekked around the world, and can honestly say this experience was second to none. This was in large part to a wonderful guide, Rawati, and porter, Buddhi. Mountain Mart takes great care of the clients, and our guide was excellent about letting us experience this trek as we wanted to. They take excellent care of porters, which was much appreciated, because we had a great one in Buddhi. He has a smile and disposition that can warm any heart. The 7 day experience was fun, breathtaking, and just enough of a physical challenge to keep us feeling like we were working for it (our longest day was around 14 miles). The terrain is challenging, a lot of stairs. Much like the Machu Piccu Trek for those that have done it. There is never a dull moment. The scenery is incredible. The lodges are surprisingly comfortable. We had private rooms at most of our stops, and a warm shower, and bathrooms that were much better kept than most trekking experiences offer. The food was good, although caution must be made in your food choices. Rawati brought snacks, etc. Overall, just an incredible and memorable experience. I cannot give any higher of a recommendation."

Our family of four just returned from a very successful trek up to Everest Base Camp, and we would like to thank and recommend Mountain Mart Treks. We decided to use a tour operator, instead of trying to organise everything ourselves, and are glad we did. Absolutely everything was arranged for us, completely hassle-free, from pick-up at the Kathmandu airport to drop-off there a couple weeks later. Lodging, meals and permits were all taken care of, even when we 'deviated from the original plan'. We looked at the various operators, emailed our top five, and chose MMT based on their quick and positive replies, and their willingness to tailor the trip exactly when and the way we wanted. We couldn't have asked for more. The guide and porters were very helpful, but didn't get in the way - allowing us to meet and spend time with many other trekkers along the way.We would also like to recommend MMT's guide Prem, who has personally trekked all over Nepal and in the neighbouring countries, and made more than 150 trips to EBC. His experience, level-headed counselling and friendship allowed us to make the important decisions we needed to make along the way, and maximise our good time! If we decide to return to Nepal, to do one of the many other interesting treks, we will definitely use this team again."

Was very thankful to have Rewati with us then as it is dangerous to walk in the forest at night. Was scary too but with him there, I felt safe.As for the managing director, Dolakh also known to us as mob boss because he looks like one. Lol. He's very friendly and was flexible with our itinerary.

We met other guides (from other companies) that would walk along side their group and leave for a bit with friends and come back, but not Bodrey. When we experienced over a foot of snow and thought we might not be able to make it passed, Bodrey was up all night trying to make a plan so we could push on and we made it! This was my husband's and my first trek. We've hiked in the US, but only for weekends. Mountain Mart answered every question I could come up with and within a reasonable time frame.

What makes Mountain Mart Treks special is that Dolakh Thapa is a still young and energetic, and an intelligent person who has long-standing experience with guiding tourists to the remotest places in the country before he started Mountain Mart Trips. Young, experienced and enthusiastic, I would say. MMT also does international events like treks around Mount Kailas (Kailas Yatra) - the holiest mountain in the world situated in Tibet over passes above 5000 meters (15.000 feet) -and book trips to Tibet, Bhutan and other uncommon destinations I have known him for more than 15 years as a reliable friend, and it is therefore no miracle to me that 80 % of the clients who he has helped earlier return to him when they come again. You have to try and perhaps you will also belong to that \u2018club of 80%\u2019 or even more. Dolakh claims a success rate of his trips of 99 % - I wonder where that 1 % comes from? Claiming perfection would destroy humility!Of course, if you make such a claim, you have to and will do everything to live up to it. That guarantees that MMT will do the utmost to satisfy your individual wishes according to your character (even if it is whimsical) or to suit groups according to worked-out schedules.It guarantees an unforgettable experience in this amazing part of the world!- Dr. Rudi Jansma, The Netherlands."

MMT arranged our 14 day tour of Nepal which included some Kathmandu sightseeing and a 10 day trek to Poon Hill and Annapurna Base Camp. Dolakh, who runs MMT, was very responsive from the first point of contact and provided all the information we needed for the trip. He also proactively followed up on flight information and details which were required for a smooth trip. After being picked up from Kathmandu airport, we were brought to MMT to meet our trekking guide and had our equipment checked out. MMT would make sure we had all the necessary gear and supplement any inadequate equipment. Coming from a tropical country, it was a really helpful step as some of our stuff was not suitable. During our 10 day trek, our guide Prem always made sure that we were trekking at a comfortable pace, had the best available rooms with hot showers and made meal times an occasion to look forward too! He would always tell us stories about the trail and life in Nepal. Trekking plans were dynamic due to weather and group speed, but Prem was always able to accommodate last minute changes by rearranging our accommodation plans via phone which was crucial due to the high demand of rooms from other trekkers. In many villages, we managed to secure a room while seeing many other trekkers being turned away. On our way up to ABC, we met many trekkers coming down who weren't able to summit due to the heavy snow and had stories of how bad the route was. However, Prem's experience came into play and brought us to our destination safely. When it came to the more treacherous parts of the trek, Prem would always ensure that we traverse them safely.In summary, Prem and MMT tried their best to ensure that we have the very best trekking experience and now I'm already planning my next Langtang trek with them!"

I went on the Everest Base Camp trek with a group of 6 friends with Mountain Mart from Mar. 9, 2015 to Mar. 19, 2015 and all I can say is that they are awesome. Our guide, Prem, was excellent, knowledgeable, made sure all of our needs were met, and genuinely cared for the safety of each person in our group. Prem had very good English and had many years of experience guiding treks in the Himalayas, including the EBC trek, and was always happy to share his stories. Prem's food recommendations were excellent. The porters were all friendly and superhumanly strong. The accommodations were on par with what you get in each village, although you need to temper your expectations as the higher up you go on the mountain, the worse the accommodations are. This is not because of Mountain Mart, but merely a reality of hiking the EBC trek.Now the important stuff. Prem made sure that we were taking appropriate measures to avoid symptoms of altitude sickness, including eating enough food so that we had the energy to complete the days trek, drinking enough water and taking diamox at the right time to minimize symptoms of altitude sickness. When members of our group did start to exhibit minor symptoms, i.e., headache (as is inevitable on the EBC trek), he made sure we were honest with our symptoms and made sure he was updated with how we were feeling at regular intervals. Our group had people with varying trekking experience levels and Prem was very good at setting a slow, but steady pace, especially on the uphill portions, so that we would all reach the next stop on the trek without being too tired or over exerting. Also, Prem demonstrated excellent route finding skills when it started to snow during the trek and the snow covered the trail. As an experienced hiker, to me this was a true sign that Prem was a very experienced guide. In addition, Prem's estimates on hiking time were amazingly accurate.Unfortunately, we had one member of our group that ended up with moderate altitude sickness despite our best precautions. However, I believe this illustrates how great Prem and Mountain Mart are. Prem was very helpful in identifying that the person could not continue because of the altitude and the difficulty of the next day's trek and arranging for a helicopter to come and take the person down. Prem was an invaluable resource in identifying a problem and providing a solution. For the EBC trek where weather and other issues can cause a delay or force you to change your itinerary, Prem's expertise was invaluable. I was very grateful for Prem's experience and judgment. Without a doubt, this is the type of guide you want for an EBC trek. While we always hope things go smoothly on an EBC trek, sometimes they just don't, and having a great, experienced, compassionate guide like Prem can help you get through the problems and still have a great experience.Mountain Mart is run by Dolakh and Prem. Both of them are honest Nepalese people who are trying to build a lasting business. I admire their entrepreneurship, kindness, commitment to service, and honesty and I hope this review leads you to choose Mountain Mart because I feel very indebted to Dolakh and Prem for helping make my EBC trek experience so memorable! I felt very well taken care of by Mountain Mart and can strongly recommend them to anyone looking for a great guide and trekking experience in Nepal. Thank you Prem and Dolakh!"

Everything was sorted for us from the moment we went to the Mountain Mart office, we were picked up from our hotel the next day, taken to the aiport where our flight was delayed due to bad visibility Dolakh arranged a car for us to drive to Pokhara, where a jeep was waiting for us to take us up to the first stop on trek. From then on the guide and porter, also the amazing jeep driver, were so helpful and great throughout the whole trek. Lucikly we had a beautiful clear morning for our ascent of Poon Hill and the views are utterly breath taking. Thanks again for a great trek."

None of us actually trained for the trek & we're first timers, so we were slow, had altitude sickness (the girls), tripped a couple times but we were very well taken care of & completed the trek in schedule! Prem got us honey lemon ginger drink which was so good & helped with the altitude sickness!! And they brought fruits along for us too! Dolakh was also very kind and prompt in replying emails & helped to customise our itinerary for a 11 days trip (3-14th Dec 2013) - 2 days city tour in capital Kathmandu, 8 days ABC trek, last day in Pokhara city tour, including 30mins of paragliding! All accommodation, 3 meals during trek & breakfast in hotel in the city, domestic flight, down jacket, sleeping bag, walking stick were all included!"

Awesome trip to Annapurna Base Camp via Poon Hill and all the villages in between, I was part of the Niven's Eleven group that had a fabulous trip at the end of 2014. All the parts of our trip were organised by Dolakh and his team, this included sightseeing in the Kathmandu valley, our trip to ABC and some post trek R&R in Pokara and a couple of nights in the very nice Yak & Yeti hotel in Kathmandu, it also including a flight to the top the world to see Mount Everest and the Himalaya. Although the extra bits were brilliant the main reason for our visit was to trek to Annapurna and this was made possible with the support of our guides and porters who were AWESOME. Cannot thank Tilakh and his assistant Guness for all their support and encouragement on the trip and also for their patience as we took photo after photo for 10 days.We also had a late request of Dolakh to organise a 60th birthday party at short notice on our return to Kathmandu, Mountain Mart organised the venue (K Too steakhouse) and the birthday cake etc. a memorable evening was had by all, Willie (the birthday boy) could not believe it when probably the finest chocolate birthday cake I have ever tasted was brought out after dinner. Superb.If you are considering a trekking holiday in Nepal just contact Mountain Mart Treks & Expedition and let Dolakh organise it all, before he hands you over to Tilakh for what will be the trip of a lifetime."

Their package are transparent with little additional charges along the trekking unless you want to charge your electronics or consume bottled drink. We used Jeep transportation to trek starting point. The Jeep is in good condition and pick up are on time. For lodges along the trek, we had 2 nigh with gas fired shower which provides stable hot water.(Solar power shower is not stable in Winter times) At locations without gas fired shower, boiled water and shower bag were provided free of charge. Some minor concerns: Food safety along this rout is not so good,though this has nothing to do with the travel agent. It is advised to bring some medicine for stomach problemsThe Guide are equip with good shoes for snow, however, the porter wore a sneaker and will have problem if walk in deep snow for consecutive days."

We booked our base camp trek through mountain mart after seeing all the positive reviews on tripadvisor and this turned out to be a fantastic decision. Dolakh was an absolute pleasure to deal with and was quick to answer any questions we had about the trek. The trek itself was an amazing experience and a special mention goes to our guide Bodri who looked after us and ensured that we knew what was ok to eat and drink and made sure we took our time getting up the mountain. With his help and our amazing (and funny) porters we were able to make it to base camp without succumbing to altitude sickness like other groups we encountered on the way up. The jackets provided were excellent quality and the included food was more than you'll need on your trip. All in all the next time I book a trek in Nepal I'll be doing it through Mountain mart."

Thanks must go to our wonderful guide Tilakh and his assistant Guness for there support, advice, encouragement and effort to please our party of 12 walkers ( Nivens Eleven). I did a lot of research into reputable tour companies for this lifetime ambition and chose Mountain Mart based on there recommendations on Trip Advisor and there qualifications. Dolakh was on hand from day one of my initial enquires answering all queries and giving advice were required and giving me peace of mind. I had dreamt about this experience for 12 years and it truly was an emotional and rewarding journey. Equipment supplied was of good quality and some of the talker people in our group required larger jacket / sleeping bags and this was addressed. Our every need was catered for and the tea houses ( lodges) flushing toilets were of a very good standard and the food was very good (Dal Bat recommended). We enjoyed the company of both guides and the 6 porters assisting with our kit who tended to stay with the group and assist with directions, tea stops etc when required. Tilakh worked hard at ensuring we were well looked after and that was reciprocated with a wee dram (malt whisky) at night time when we had a night cap. The Lakeside Retreat in Pokhara was a great hotel and worth the swap of return flight for land journey which was a fantastic experience to see more of the culture and will live long in the memory of many in the group. On our return to Kathmandu Dolakh was very hospitable and took us to the K2 Restuarant for dinner that evening. If you are thinking about a trip in Nepal, we did the ABC, then I would have no hesitation in booking Mountain Mart and being in the trustyhands of Dolakh and Tilakh, you will be glad you took the advice..."

The both of them ensured that my group (4 girls) were well taken of. In fact, we were spoilt! We were able to order anything we wanted off the menu, and our belongings were always transported to our lodge room. Our welfare was well taken care of, with snacks and water provided along the way. They always ensured that we were happy, and that we would trek safely - the route was slippery and our porter provided us with support -- even whilst carrying all that weight! One thing I'd like to highlight is that the employees seemed really happy to be working for Mr Dolakh, which I feel is a really salient and important point. With a great boss, they would do their best and provide the best service to the customers. I had an amazing trip with them and I would go back again. :)"

Our guide Bodri was excellent - he customised the trip according to the weather conditions and we actually made it to base camp despite many groups heading back because of the snow. All food was included in the trip price, and there was plenty of it. The quality of the hired sleeping bag and down jacket was great. I would recommend doing base camp in December, there were hardly any other people trekking so at times we had the track all to ourselves. It is freezing at night (I think the coldest was about -30), but very pleasant during the day (we only had to wear a fleece jumper). If you're planning on doing EBC, definitely go with mountain mart!"

            "review": "4 Day Poon Hill trek. So the 5 of us decided to climb the 3210m Poon Hill from 5-8 December 2014. We went with Mountain Mart because it was the only tour operator we can find on the internet which offered the shortest trek up a Himalayan mountain. The price tag of USD380 per person which included transfers, meals and accommodation was also another attraction. We were not expecting much due to the low price tag, however 5-star service we received was a pleasant surprise. First of all, the company upgraded our land transfer from Kathmandu to Pokhara to a domestic flight without additional cost. The flight gave us an aerial view of the mountains and avoided a repeat experience of the return leg by land where we journeyed through mountain roads, busy towns and river crossings. For that, we were provided with a 7 seater Japanese MPV which made the 6-hour drive back to Pokhara a comfortable one. Our trek was accompanied by a guide, Prem Thapa and 2 porters, Ganesh and Nabin. I was surprised that they were quite young as all three were in their twenties. Nevertheless they were very professional. However, soon gave in to our chidings and we became friends quickly. The bond we built during the trek which were filled with conversations, laughter and even singing made the experience richer but less tiring. Even with our guards down, they were very careful not to cross the line between client and service providers. Prem also performed \u2018surgery\u2019 on one of our member\u2019s shoes which did an alligator. In terms of accommodation, they gave in to our request for en-suite bedrooms in the lodges in the hills which made our rest from the gruelling trek even more rewarding. There was also no addition to cost on this upgrade. On the last day of the tour, Prem acceded to our request to meet pre-school children in the Tibetian refugee camp in Pokhara where we distributed gifts we brought from Singapore. It was fantastic meeting the enthusiastic kids. And just before we were sent to the airport, we were taken to the office of our tour operator in Thamel, where Dolakh, the managing director, presented us with our certificates and a traditional cloth for good luck. It was a bonus that Thamel was shopping heaven for tourist to buy souvenirs at great prices for our loved ones back home. These last two visits were not part of the itinerary but was a very welcomed addition. There are many tour operators in Nepal but we would definitely recommend Mountain Mart based on our positive experience. They really took care of us and we felt the bond that we created went beyond business."

I really don't understand why other people go with the far more expensive other trekking companies such as ACE himalayas or intrepid, Mountain mart treks is top quality at such a competitive price. We booked our 12 day everest base camp trek almost one year in advance and were kept in regular contact with the team. Dolakh in particular was happy to reply to my constant emails during the months as I had plenty of questions! The team picked us up from Nepal airport and took us to see Dolakh at his office for a meeting before our trek the next day. He provided us with all the paperwork and information that we needed including all the gear that was promised to us. They even dropped us to our hotel after. We could not have asked for anything more during the following 12 days. We were transported to the airport and picked up at the other in end in Lukla by our guide and porter who were absolutely fantastic during the trek. Our guide, Lochan, was kind, enthusiastic, flexible and encouraging the entire time. If you're able to request him then go for it! We were fed all our meals and given plenty of tea breaks during the day which was all included in the price. As the trek got harder (after day 6/7) Lochan provided us with chocolate bars to keep our energy levels up which was a great help. Whilst we were on the trek we also noticed that porters from other companies would go ahead and leave the groups behind, meeting them at the guest houses later on. However, our porter (Super Binad!) did no such thing. He stayed alongside us every step of the way just in case we needed anything from our bags. He even told us that he knew we would feel more comfortable having our bags nearby. He even offered to carry my girlfriend up the final few steps when she was struggling with it all!! We kindly declined but the constant words of encouragement from them both meant that we were able to complete the experience. Lochan, our guide, was incredibly knowledgeable about the trek and the routes being able to give us a literal step by step guide of how the route and the terrain would pan out. Trust me, you will want to know where all the steep hills are! He was even able to educate us on what feelings were normal and not so normal to experience due to the altitude which we found very helpful and gave us peace of mind. When we were feeling unwell he provided us with medication and advice, all of which helped us. Due to both of their friendliness and warm heartednessnes we grew very close to them over the 12 days and this just made the whole experience more enjoyable. I couldn't speak more highly of Dolakh and his team and the incredible value for money that they provided us with. I really hope they rise up the list of trekking companies as the experience was one that we will never forget. We left Nepal with a once in a life time achievement and many some new friends. All the best guys!!"

The trek was fantastic and my guide, Ganesh, worked super hard to make sure we were staying in the best places and to make sure I had everything I needed. He was an excellent guide and though his English wasn't perfect, it was good and he made up for any lack of English skills with his eagerness to help, his kindness, and his willingness to teach me the basics of Nepalese. It also seemed like he knew every inch of the trail and all the places and people along the way, which was great. I felt entirely safe the entire time and felt like I was in good hands! I met other trekkers along the trail who were traveling with other companies and who felt their guides were trying to cheat them or who didn't trust their guides and I didn't experience that at all. At the end of the trek Dolakh again made sure I had everything I needed and even came to see me off to the airport, which was a nice personal touch. I would definitely trek with Mountain Mart again and hope to one day soon!"

I had great weather the whole trip, I would recommend this company to everyone."

I trekked with my guide Badri Panta from Mountain Mart Treks in June 2014 and had the best time of my life on the trails of Annupurna Circuit. On every step of the way, my guide Badri was helpful and informative on the local cultures, history and food. I was delighted to be introduced to many of the local snacks and that made the difference. Badri was friendly and very fun as a guide and companion on the trek. He was able to point out the finer details of trekking in Annapurna and most importantly Badri had a good command of English. Doklakh, the manager, is a great person to deal with when I first contacted Mountain Mart Treks to arrange for my guide. Keep up good work, Mountain Mart Trek! Highly recommended."

I have forgotten even how many times I visited Nepal - its my favorite country. When he was still young (now he must be over 35) he helped me organizing beautiful treks and even then had so many contacts with the right people. I was happy for him when he could start his own business. He has traveled with me to remote places while organizing buses, airplanes - local and international - treks, permits, accommodation, money exchange and - last but not least - visa for India, including 'impossible' ones. He is a kindhearted and naturally helpful person and, if you didn't bring it yourself, he will give you the courage to act and enjoy. I am a low budget tourist, and usually travelling alone in the cheapest way, but for those who can afford it he will organize white water rafting, canoeing, 'jumping' off the mountain, helicopters to the snow and all the 'adrenaline' adventures you can have in Nepal. So try, and experience."

Through strong recommendation by another friend who has trekked with Dolakh several times, we decided to engaged his service. Dolakh was really helpful, patiently and promptly replying our numerous queries through email. He helped put together a 15 days itinerary which included an awesome trek at Langtang, day tours in Kathmandu & a short safari at Chitwan National Park.Dolakh personally received us at the airport and was a perfect host. At Kathmandu, we stayed at the FUJI HOTEL, which is a short walk away to bustling Thamel area where we could easily stock up on our trekking necessities. A day tour of Kathmandu was arranged by Dolakh, we were driven in a clean & comfortable car to various Unesco World Heritage sites and given ample time to explore the fascinating sites on our own. We even witnessed traditional cremation rites at the Crematoria at Pashupatinath Temple!The ultimate highlight has to be our 8days trek in beautiful Langtang. Our guide TILAK and porter SUDIP were excellent, they were attentive and took good care of my friends who were on their first long mountain trek. The Langtang trail meanders through breathtakingly beautiful valleys with quaint villages and amazing terraced fields, precarious suspension bridges, magical montane forests, meeting the very friendly villagers and finally a climb to the summit of Kyanjin Ri (4779m).After our trek, we made a short safari trip to Chitwan National Park where we got close encounters with elephants, indian one-horned rhinoceros and many other wildlife. Particularly unforgettable was a canoe ride along a river with numerous mugger crocodiles & indian gharials basking on the river banks!!!Having enjoyed our Nepalese adventure so much, I'm already making plans for another trek end of this year... with Mountain Mart of course!"

On all trekkings I had such a great and wonderful time. Every trekking is different as to toughness, scenery, altitude, but I can honestly say that ALL trekkings are worth while doing if you like hiking, mountain people and some effort and basic conditions!!!Mountain Mart has proven a reliable trekking agency with trust worthy guides and porters, who take real good care of you. Beside that I find that the guides of Mountain Mart know their bussines very well. They can tell you a lot about the scenery, the people, the trekking, the altitude etc. They are real professionals which gives a feeling of easy-ness. It is easy to make contact with your guide which is so nice and important especially to me, because I was doing the trekking on my own. For woman alone trekking with a guide is always a kind of risk. You hear stories of guides who get too familiar. But the guides in Mountain Mart are discrete, and I never ever felt like a had to be on my gard. I felt safe with my guide. I recommend Mountain Mart to everybody who loves Nepal and wants to do some trekking. The prices are fair and there is still room for negotianion.

The porter we had was an absolute machine! He had no issues carrying the extra clothes and supplies we decided to pass his way. The tour was very relaxed and we had the opportunity to provide our input as to what we wanted to accomplish and how quickly we wanted to accomplish it. I never felt rushed on the trek and the pace was set based on how we were feeling that day. The price and timing for the trek was also desirable. The trek with mountain mart treks was a couple days shorter than other companies which I preferred since it allowed for more time spent in Kathmandu and touring other areas.
