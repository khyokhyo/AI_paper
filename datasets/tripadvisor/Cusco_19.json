            "review": "Chocolate Workshop was great. We had a great time at the Choco Museo's chocolate-making workshop, and this review is for that experience. There are several locations in Cusco and Lima, some offering different workshops, but the basic course that my group did was approximately 2 hours for about 70 PEN (Peru Soles). It started with a introduction to the bean production, moved into basic production methods like using special tools to roast the beans, using a mortar and pestle to grind the beans into a paste, etc. The entire process takes 24 hours, so after guests finish with the steps leading up to the cooking, they are given pre-made chocolate (dark or milk) to mix with ingredients and place into plastic molds for refrigeration. The final step is to return an hour or so later and pick up the final product, which was delicious! The host spoke fluent English and Spanish and kept the class interesting for everyone."

We started with a free tour of the museum which was really interesting and had so many free samples we had to refuse some of the liquors as it wasn't even 10am and we were already feeling tipsy! Oscar who gave us the tour was really friendly! We then signed up for chocolate making workshop from coco bean to actual chocolates we got to take home. Again lots of free samples my husband won some chocolate tea and the chocolatier Jill who taught us was a real character then class was fun, informative and light hearted. Couldn't recommend it enough!"

The tour is offered in Spanish and English. On said tour they will take you in a small room where they will talk about the history of chocolate in Peru. This is interesting, but the best part is they let you sample the chocolate. We also sampled their hot chocolate and jams. Delicious! The gift shop has many chocolate treats one can buy, and there is a lovely adjoining cafe with many tantalizing treats that are not too expensive. For people who are looking to get more of a chocolate experience, they offer chocolate workshops. My group did not partake in this but it looked like fun. Overall it was an enjoyable experience, and it was a nice way to kill an hour."

Our guide, Gil, was very entertaining and informative. He gave us a briefing on the cocoa industry in Peru and then moved us all to the kitchen workshop. Our group included everyone from a 10 year old to a 60 year old and everyone enjoyed the session. We roasted beans, made 3 different versions of hot chocolate and then used the already tempered chocolate to make molds of our choice with favors and additional fillings of our choice. You pick up your finished chocolate 50 minutes to an hour after the class. The cost was S/70 each."

During the workshop, we learnt about the processes involved in making chocolate, tried three different types of hot chocolate, had a go at grinding beans by hand & got to create our own chocolates to take away (with a choice of milk or dark chocolate & plenty of different fillings, such as coconut, peanuts, almonds, oreos, cocoa nibs, puffed quinoa, M&Ms & salt). The staff were very friendly (especially Yilmar :) ) & happy to give tasters of products; I recommend the chocolate banana jam & cocoa nib tea, which were both incredible! The on-site caf\u00e9 is also really nice, with plenty of decadent chocolate drinks (with soy options available!) & treats to choose from & lovely views over Plaza Regocijo.

You select your cacao beans, heat them, peel the shells, grind them, etc to make 3 types of chocolate drinks and later melted chocolate/flavorings to make candies. Before getting started you go over a basic history of the cacao tree and chocolate history. I felt there could've been more the museum aspect of it, which is why I took off one review point. However, the instructor was awesome (and speaks in English, Spanish, or French) and your drinks/candy are delicious! Definitely recommend."

Conveniently located just a block off the plaza, the short free guided tour gives great information about cacao beans, the history, and process of chocolate making. We had \"Jill\" as our guide and he was fantastic!! He was very thorough and his English was excellent. The best part - sampling! We could taste the differences in dark, milk, and white chocolate. Then we tasted the differences in chocolate made from beans from different areas. Who knew they could have those nuances? We tasted various flavored jams made with chocolate. And we tasted liqueurs made with chocolate - several samples, as long as we could keep standing perhaps. We finished with smooth creamy hot chocolate made the old fashioned way.Of course they also offer several items for sale in their second floor museum, as well as their shop on the street.We were limited on time so were unable to take either of the 2-hour classes. The class in session at the time seemed to be having a great time though. This should definitely be on anyone's 2-day tour of Cusco. I mean, how many cathedrals and churches and monuments and old buildings can you truly remember? A chocolate museum, tour, and samples? Unforgettable!"

We enjoyed the chocolate making class that lasted two hours, and we started with raw cocoa beans and got to go through the whole process of peeling the beans, roasting them, crushing them ... all the way through to putting the chocolate in molds & coming back at least two hours later to pick up our home-made chocolates. Everyone got to participate - some of the steps we each did at our own place; some of the steps were done in a central pot and we took turns stirring it etc. If you are a chocolate fanatic, I'd highly recommend the class. I did think that we would learn more about the history of chocolate making during this class, and we did not learn much about that so that was a bit disappointing. The chocolate prices in this store are expensive (eg. $US 6 per 85% dark chocolate bar of 90-100 gms each) but it was yummy chocolate. I did ask at our hotel what is the best chocolate in town, and he told me the Republic of Cocoa which also has a store. Their chocolate prices are 32 soles/bar -- or about 9-10 US$/bar so much more expensive than the ChocoMuseo's prices. One thing we did learn while in Cusco, is that just because a chocolate bar says it is 85% chocolate, doesn't mean it is. We bought a bar marked as 85% chocolate with the brand of 'Machu Picchu chocolate' at the San Pedro market and it was more like a 45-50% cocoa bar. So if you want good chocolate to bring home for friends, best to get one of the better brands so you know it will be good."

We learned that roasted beans give off banana, coffee and olive notes - cool party knowledge, check!After finishing the process of prepping the beans, you try three different drinks - chocolate tea, Mayan hot chocolate and Peruvian hot chocolate (not sure if that's the real name, but that's what we called it). Following the drinks, you get to pour your own chocolates and mix them with any fixins you like! After pouring they take an hour to set so don't make the mistake we did of having to leave right after the class.

It was great to hear about the process from the instructor (who was great), but there was a lot less hands-on experience than I was expecting. The class boasts of \"making your own chocolates\", but that just means pouring already-prepared chocolate into molds and adding some toppings. I think I'll go for the \"Truffles\" class next time. :)Tasty though! Definitely stop by to pick up some choco bean husks for making tea!!"

Much self-guided information provided as well in diagram form and captions about the history of chocolate, etc. in both Spanish and English. The added bonus of tasting various types of chocolate was great. The museum also sells a variety of chocolate-based products. The White Chocolate Chirimoya Liqour is definitely a worthy find along with many of the chocolate treats to take home. An hour and a half well-spent."

The kitchen session was led by Gladys, a wonderful instructor who spoke very good English. She explained the process of making chocolate, spreading out chocolate beans still in their hulls which we removed with our fingers, and then chewed on a bit of the bean to discover its complexity of flavor including hints of banana and vinegar. She then set up the chunky ingredients (ranging from raisins, coffee beans, and almonds to marshmallows and M&Ms) and also the shaker ingredients (cinnamon, sea salt, chili pepper, coca, ginger and more.) We selected molds to shape our candies and whether we wanted dark or milk chocolate. After some final instructions on how to fill and tamp out air bubbles, she let us at it. There were shakers going back and forth, ingredients added, slight pandemonium, and lots of laughter. It was a delightful interlude and we received our completed, cooled candies at the hotel. I can't speak to the restaurant but we found some nice reasonable trip gifts, including $5 earrings, chocolate bath salts, and (naturally) candy. Also, a not unimportant thing when traveling with families, the best public restroom we went to in Peru."

Take the time to walk around and explore the history that is explained around the walls on this double level little shop. You're welcomed with a nice chocolate tea by the staff and they offer chocolatier classes where you learn more about the coffee beans and get to make some chocolate and of course eat it. A great history about chocolate in Peru and so many momento to take home with you.Definitely worth a visit. The best part is that the chocolate blocks they make there are in the shape of inca walls.

Then we took to the kitchen to crush, peel, roast and grind the cocoa beans up to what would normally be a useful paste. Given time constraints, we then switched to pre made chocolate to then assemble our own chocolate using different seeds, spices, nuts and sprinkles (M&M and Oreos were a true crowd pleaser).Once our moulds were full we were then encouraged to lick the bowl and the chocolate was delicious! The chocolate was then set and we could pick it up an hour later. Applicable to all ages and good value for money in my opinion, a great way to spend the afternoon!"

We went to ChocoMuseo on our first full day in Cusco, as we wanted a fun activity which wouldn't leave us too exhausted at the city's high altitude. Arriving just before the 11am session, we enquired as to whether there were still spaces. Fortunately for us, there were - although having gone back in the afternoon to collect our chocolates, I'm not sure we'd have been able to get into the afternoon session, so overall I would recommend booking in advance.Our tutor, Gladys, was fun and informative. She also switched effortlessly between Spanish and English to ensure that everyone in the group was catered for. With an introduction to the cocoa bean and how it is harvested, stored and fermented, we were well set up for our hands-on experience. I won't spoil too many surprises here, but it's fair to say that almost all stages of \"bean to bar\" are covered, and that you do get to be very hands on. Also, Gladys nearly got the better of us with a little joke; a quick Google search when we got home confirmed what we thought - that she'd been pulling our leg :-)The only stage that's excluded, for timing purposes, is the tempering of the chocolate; even then, we were given a good explanation, but given the complexity and the time required it makes sense that we didn't get to have a try ourselves.Finally, we were able to create our own chocolate flavour combinations - I'm enjoying mine as I type!Afterwards, I enjoyed a brownie and a cup of chocolate tea in the cafe - a nice, relaxing and reasonably-priced way to pass the time before heading back to the workshop to collect my handiwork!"

The people were very welcoming, but really, there wasn't much about the history of cacao at all. There were classes available, but it was not clear how you signed up, or when. There were chocolate samples - great! In the end, it seemed to be mostly a chocolate shop."

It was packed with interesting chocolate infromation and we got to make our own unique chocolates to take home with us and lick the delicious melted chocolate we did not use from the bowl! What a treat for anyone who loves chocolate. The class was totally worth it. They fit us in as our schedule was tight, and I am sure if you have more time that the longer class would be great! Also we had children in our class (about 9 and 12) and they enjoyed it!"

Although they have a first floor store, the actual museum, cafe, and class is on the second floor and can only be accessed by walking around the corner and entering through an open door and up stairs (it can be tricky).There are several reasons why we are giving the ChocoMuseo a 5-star review. We signed up for the chocolate making class and it was SO MUCH FUN (well, the first 20 minutes that is)! My son was ill about 20 minutes into the class and one of the employees immediately approached him with coca tea, rubbed tea leaves on his forehead, and gave him some liquid that she fetched out of a first aid kit. She was very kind and caring. We weren't able to complete the class unfortunately and luckily my son only suffered briefly from dehydration (it was a hot day).We were able to return to the second floor cafe and store after our Inca Trail hike/Machu Picchu trip and was sitting in the cafe drinking and eating when both the lady that helped my son and the man that was teaching the class remembered us. We spent about 2 hours in the cafe enjoying the surroundings. While at the register waiting to purchase all the fun chocolately goodies, we were offered a 10% discount!Not only is the ChocoMuseo extremely educational, but it is comfortable, kind of like your family's kitchen. If you have kids, I would definitely not miss it."

One can ask: what can go wrong knowing that their product quality is decent according to Peruvian standards. Well, many things are not OK- staff: clearly each employee does not know its responsibility as they are litterally jumping around. We had 4 different waiters, asking the same questions - also after order was placed. Our 'main' waiter was completely unstructured, laughing around withcolleagues without attention for the guests. Very unprofessional. Openess is great if it remains professional. How can you Enjoy your drink if they litterally are taking away each fork, plate or glass once its finished? Its means to be superb service but it gives you the complete opposite feeling. Like they are constantly looking at you. Also no question if you enjoyed it or not.- product: as said decent. The chocolate fondue however was with rather cold chocolate making it impossible to eat with the fruit- visitors: great that its a museum as well, but if you are drinking a chocolate milk with 30 people shouting around you, there is only a crowded mess after all and it takes away the Joy of drinking your hot chocolate completely. Nice view if you can catch a spot on the terrace.- payment: you need to go to the cashier to pay, where another employee needs to type in your full order again.Sadly i'm not just An old pensioner picky on everything, but a 26yo not liking to write bad reviews."

Not having much time in Cusco, I decided not to try a workshop, but a friend and I spent a very happy hour on the balcony drinking hot chocolate and watching life go by. We came back later in the week to do some souvenir shopping. One of the nicest things about this little museum was the lack of hard sell. We didn't feel under any pressure at all to buy anything."

She also spoke fluent english!It was such an interactive class, we got to try a lot of different chocolate drinks and made our own chocolate which we took home with us. The class room was clean and well maintained. There was also a young girl in our class with her parents (maybe 8 years old?) who was having so much fun, I would recommend this activity for families! The class was a few hours, the time flew by as we were having so much fun! After we had finished we spent some time in the adjoining shop and sampled the Pisco drinks mixed with different flavours - the lady behind the counter was very accommodating! I would recommend this to anyone who has a spare few hours, it was a highlight of our trip!"

Despite being advertised as a museum I agree with others that the exhibits and free tour provided serve as a courtship process towards angling the customer to purchase chocolate or dine at their small cafe - which is fair enough. On entering the museum a English guide introduced herself and took us around - taking around 20 minutes in a tour focusing on the creation of chocolate as well as it's introduction and ongoing production in Peru since the colonial influx. She also introduced us to her products and included a free tasting. I was quite impressed by her English and depth of information and to be honest was waiting for a dollar squeeze. But apart from the expected sales pitch while sampling the chocolate I didn't find her pushy or tip hungry at all which was quite refreshing for this city that loves to charge tourists.I think the real highlight of visiting the chocomuseo are the 2 hour classes in which you created your own chocolate. These cost 75 sol and take place at set times of the day, with a reservation being necessary.This makes an excellent rainy day activity while in Cusco, although I wouldn't classify it as a 'must do'. Give yourself 1 hours for the museum and cafe alone or 2 hours for the cooking class. The cafe served decent but not exceptional chocolate products - although I still suggest on purchasing a item there as a way of payment for the free tours they provide."

(Apparently, the Monday 11am class period isn\u2019t that popular, and so I was the only one that showed up.) The class was 75 soles and lasted a little under two hours (but allot another hour on the back-end for your chocolate to chill and for you to come back to pick up!)As you can imagine, you don\u2019t actually go from start to finish with the bean. You go through the motions of roasting the bean, peeling and grinding it, but you fill the actual molds with chocolate that they have already made. The ground bean paste that you actually do make is used to make several cocoa-based drinks instead. Prepare yourself for cheesy activities (such as singing while you are mixing the drink, or saying a toast in Quechua). The quality of the chocolate wasn\u2019t that high, but I thought it was still worth it. Note: I think the Peru Cooking Class chocolate-making class gives you more chocolate for the same price (200g instead of 120g), but I couldn\u2019t make the Peru Cooking Class lesson, as it was only at night (7pm), and I had a plane to catch)."

We cooked corn soup, lomo saltado, rice and potatoes. Also learned to make pisco and tried different fruits with chocolate as a desert. We pretty much knew all the fruits because in our country we have all of them, but it was good to have in the group tourists from Europe and Australia that didn\u00b4t know them.We had a great time and I definitely recommend this activity which begun at the market at 5:45 and ended at almost 9:30 pm.

Our instructor, Gilmar (correct name?), was hilarious, sweet and very knowledgable. I would recommend this class to any chocolate lovers visiting Cusco with some spare time for a relaxing and fun activity."

The information we received prior to the workshop was misleading, since we hardly did anything ourselves during the workshop nor did we go through the whole process of making chocolate. We hardly received any information about chocolate making, leaving us dissappointed in the end. The only thing we did ourselves was pealing the beans and making paste with them. Afterwards we could taste some drinks, but it wasn't very clear what they were nor why we were tasting them (they mostly tasted like honey). The \"chocolate bar\" making is nothing more than filling a mold with already melted chocolate. In conclusion, I think this is fun for kids, but don't pay 75 soles for it if you actually want to learn and do something. It's way overpriced for what we did."

The class was highly entertaining and informative and in addition to trying different types of chocolate beverages (tea, Mayan, conquistador) and learning how they are made, you get to make your own chocolate pieces that you can pick up later after they set in the mold.

We tasted the raw dried beans, then roasted and shelled them. Next we ground the beans to form a stiff paste. The lady used this to make 2 types of chocolate drink for us all to try. This involved some singing which I would normally avoid, but we were having so much fun I didn't mind joining in. As the next process, the blending, takes 24 hours we were provided with some ready made chocolate to put in moulds with our own choice of additions.

As a true addict--I mean connoisseur--of chocolate I was sure to swing by the chocolate museum and book a workshop for my group, they easily fit us in the same day and had several workshop windows available. The workshop starts with a brief explanation of chocolate agriculture and a tour of the (one room) museum (it's a much better confectionary and gift shop) and then you get to sample all the steps in the chocolate making process and your group selects, roasts, peels, friends, and mixes beans into three types of delicious hot chocolate. Then you chose molds and ingredients and set to work making your own chocolate bars. The staff was fun and engaging, if perhaps a little too tacky for some of our tastes; but at the end of the day you pick up your own chocolate bars, which were delicious! Overall the workshop was amusing but not amazing, and I'd recommend it if you have time around Cusco and love chocolate and audience participation."

There's a beautiful hand drawn infographic of the chocolate making process and on the other side upstairs a comprehensive display of the history. The chocolate making workshop from Pedro was one of the best things I did in Cusco city. We got to make chocolate from scratch, roasting and grinding the beans and then choosing from a wide variety of extras to put in our chocolates. After two hours there ready to pick up and they were super tasty! Pedro knows a lot about the history of cacao and of Peru in general and is a great speaker with cheeky humor.

It was a great coincidence that was worth our time.The Choco Museo has a gift shop on the first floor and around the corner on the second floor is the actual museum. The museum isn\u2019t very big but it is interesting and is worth a glance. There is also another gift shop in the museum itself.When you first get there someone greets you and gives you a mini tour of the museum as they teach you a thing or two about chocolate. At the end of the tour you are free to taste as many things as you want that they have available (chocolate bars, chocolate jams, and chocolate liquers). I enjoyed most of the things that I tried. My favorites were probably the Brazilnut jam and the banana jam. Those ended up making their way home with me. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for samples, they will let you taste anything and the staff were incredibly friendly when we were there.The Choco Museo is not large but it is worth a stop, at least to grab some gifts for people back at home. You should not need more than an hour there."

The one in Cusco is just one block away from the Plaza de Armas, making it a great stop on a day that you're visiting the area. It's a little hard to find - you can see the Museo shop from the plaza in front of it, but the museum itself is on the second floor. To find it, you need to go to the left if you're looking at the museum and then take the stairs - you should see it then. The museum is free. It's quite small, divided into 2 rooms, but is thorough - it talks about the history and manufacturing process of chocolate in Spanish, English, and French (good translations). In the center, you can taste different kinds of chocolate, chocolate jams, and chocolate tea. There is a little restaurant if you want to buy treats. They also have chocolate-making classes, but they are rather expensive (~75 soles), but you can still have a great experience just walking around the museum and shop!"

We signed up for the \"Bean to Bar\" class and loved every second of it! It was really cool to learn about all stages of the chocolate making, and of course the drinks and chocolate you have during the workshop are to die for!I loved the first workshop so much that I did the truffle making class as well which was not as interactive as the first one, but still really great. I'm still dreaming of those amazing passionfruit truffles we made!Pedro was our chef for both classes and he was a really great instructor. He's very knowledgeable about chocolate and you can tell he really loves interacting with people - not just in the workshop but in the museum tours as well. Thanks Chef Pedro and Choco Museo!"

The entrance o the museum part is free which was really great and they even gave us a guided introduction, Antonieta who was our guide was supeeer friendly and nice and knew her business well! They gave us free samples of chocolate and cacao tea which was sooo yummy! We bought chocotejas or peruvian truffles for 3.50 soles and tried them when we got back to our hotel and it was soo worth it! Amazing dark chocolate ffilled with caramel and nuts, a must try!!!"

It was interesting to hear more history and information about chocolate (e.g., depending on what other plants grow nearby to help cross-pollenate, the cocoa can pick up some of those aromas in its taste)FYI, even though they say you have to reserve online, we never heard back any confirmation, but we ended up walking buy the place in person, and we were able to sign up for the following day. Though it's not set up quite like a museum, there was definitely alot of interesting history and info around the area (that is the size of a clothing store). They definitely have some interesting chocolate-related products (e.g., chocolate tea, lotions, etc. so interesting gifts for a chocolate-lover, plus various edible chocolate bars and spreads too)."

But don't go expecting much more than a gift shop.If you take the class, however, you'll get a totally different experience. It's not cheap - 75 soles/person, but you get a busy 2 hours learning how chocolate is made - from the tree through to chocolate bars (and you get to make your own chocolates at the end). You get to taste stuff along the way too - an unfrosted, but fermented bean, a roasted bean, hot chocolate and some different kinds of chocolate.The class leader we had was great - entertaining, animated and informative. And the guy who was there when we were picking up our finished chocolates was equally so.If you have any interest in understanding the chocolate-making process, the class is a lot of fun and quite educational.

I enrolled in the 4pm workshop and was early so was able to have a hot chocolate with chilli and honey, I sat outside on the balcony which has a lovely view. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. Josie was my teacher for the class and she sure is passionate about chocolate. It was so interesting to learn where chocolate comes from, the process involved and it's context in terms if countries which produce and consume. The class is hands on so I now how to make chocolate from scratch. I went to the class by myself and my fellow classmates were friendly. Great to do solo, on a date on with a group. thanks Josie and the chocomuseo team for a fun afternoon!"

I did a \"class\" like this in a similar place in another city which turned out to be nothing but pouring melted chocolate into a mold - the class from ChocoMuseo was the real deal.The museum itself, however, is really just a chocolate store. There is a room above the store that has a nice display of ~6-8 boards to explain the chocolate making process - the boards are simple but effective - but that's it. There's nothing real to see.Note: I'm a chocoholic and particularly enjoy dark chocolate, but the chocolate I got from the class was too bitter for me (it's not actually what we made in class as one of the steps requires 24 hours). So I suggest either getting milk chocolate or adding sugar to the mix when given the option to mix in various additives into the molds. My wife got milk chocolate and it's much better."

Things like: the employee is wear latex gloves for cleanliness but just then she ran her gloved hand though her hair so that's not sanitary anymore. Some of the staff did not have their hair pulled back or netted (as well as some of us customers working along side where some legit chocolate preparation was going on) and I actually did have to pull a long dark strange hair out of one of my beverages. On a smaller point, the grouting in the tile counter was kind of old and looking like it needed to be scrubbed/redone and resealed.Also, it was kind of funny because we were taught about how long they have to mill the chocolate to allow the sugar to fully dissolve so the chocolate isn't gritty and then the chocolate they gave us to make our take-home chocolates with was totally gritty. Still tasted good. Wasn't a big thing. Still really glad we did it but somethings for other people to consider."

We chose to take a cooking class with the Soledad one evening held upstairs in an intimate kitchen. We were escorted by our chef to the San Pedro market to shop for our ingredients and learn more about the fruit, vegetables, grains, and cheese of Peru. Soledad is a gem and her English superb (she says she's learning but I was impressed!)Together our intimate group of 6 prepared an authentic Peruvian meal.

There are 3 phases to the the tour; one guided and the other 2 on your own. For the first phase, a staff member will greet you and tell you all about the process of making chocolate. The next phase is self guided where you will go upstairs and continue learning about making chocolate; reading/seeing/smelling. the last phase is a short documentary that you watch about the history and uses of the cocoa bean and process. Lastly, you do a taste test and then you purchase. Prices are reasonable, 3.50 - 27soles ($1.19 - $9.19) So basically, chocolate for everyone on your list! They also offer 3 chocolate making classes per day 70 soles ($23.83)Even though there is no entrance fee, don't forget to tip at checkout after you purchase chocolate."

The Choco Museum is located on the 2nd floor, in a building off a side street from the main square in Cuzco. Although difficult to find, the ChocoMuseum is worth the trip.Once inside, you pay $2 to enter the \"museum\" portion of the store. There are live trees, with pods, which show the life a cacao bean. Since I was the only visitor at the time, I was givena private tour. The guide explained how chocolate is processed from bitter bean, and blended with other types of chocolate, to make the \"perfect\" taste.There is also a section with different chocolate \"molds\" so you can see how chocolate is crafted into different shapes.You can buy just about anything you can think of here. They obviously sell chocolates of all types (milk, white, dark) and even show you what the ingredients are which go into the chocolate. You can buy cookies, brownies, fudge, and cakes. But you can also purcahse beverages (or powder to make your own drinks, once at home), shampoos, soaps, body creams, etc. This is really a chocolate lover's delight!This is not the only location of this museum. There are several, including a much smaller one outside the ruins of Ollanytambo. Either way, make sure to go to one of these locations while in PERU. You will not be sorry you did."

What a heaven this place is for a person like me :) I did the \"Beans-to-Bar\" workshop and it was so much fun and informative. We laughed as we learned the process from bean to a bar, we drank amazing chocolate drinks and made our own bars. What a great way to start the day, Chocolate makes people happy and I surely went out there a happy woman. It\u00b4s amazing to sit on one of the small balcony overlooking Regocijo square, have a wonderful brownie or fruit chocolate fondue. I also highly recommend the cacao tea that you can taste for free or win by grinding in the workshop, it\u00b4s delicious :)"

We were given the beans to roast, made coco tea with the shell and had some amazing hot chocolate to drink. We were able to add our own combination of ingredients and set our chocolate to mold. My kids had an amazing time and this is one of their favorite memory of the trip to Peru."

Nevertheless, you can take a chocolate-making class, which we really enjoyed. Classes run 3 or 4 times per day and it's recommended to make a reservation in advance (we made a reservation directly at the place). The cost is around 30-35 euro I think. Very nice lady, leading the class, explained to us the whole process of chocolate making, and some steps we were able to try on our own (cocoa beans roasting, mashing, peeling....). We were even preparing the chocolate \"tea\" (hot water and cocoa beans' shells) and typical peruvian cocoa. At the end of the class each of us was able to make its own chocolate truffles with different flavours according to our wish (various nuts, cinammon, coconut, vanilla, salt, chilli, coca, coffee etc...), which we could take home. Amazing experience!"

The chocolate paste was served with hot milk, so it was easy to mix based on your preference. I recommend taking the chocolate making class, trying a few liqueurs and other cocoa products.

Quite easy to book onto, although we missed one because it was full, so it is worth booking in advance. The lady who led it was really fun and spoke perfect English. We followed the production process right through from bean to finished product, and it was very hands on. We sampled a few Quechuan and Mayan chocolate drinks, some of them nicer than others! Then we made flavoured chocolates with loads of ingredients available to flavour our own chocolates. We then picked them up later on once they'd set. They were amazing!

Whether you take a chocolate making class, walk through the museum exhibits or enjoy the Sunday Chocolate Brunch, you MUST visit ChocoMuseo if you are in Cusco! EAT/DRINK: Take a moment when you walk in the door and just inhale! Now look around at all of the chocolates and you'll understand why the staff here is so happy and helpful; who wouldn't be happy surrounded by chocolate, and customers who are happy because they are eating and drinking chocolate? You'll be given a little intro to the place and offered something you've probably never tried - chocolate tea made by steeping the cacao husk pieces in hot water. Sounds weird, but I like it. There are chocolates to sample and you can enjoy a Chocolate Pisco (a Peruvian brandy made from white grapes) tasting. There are several kinds, I got the Passion Fruit version and I'm still enjoying it! If you buy some to take home, pack it carefully; they will wrap the cap well with strong tape, but you may still lose a bit of the liquid.The Caf\u00e9 menu is great; lots of chocolate temptations to enjoy at the tables set up throughout the facility. Chocolate fondue with fruit, chocolate lollipops to stir into your coffee or lattes, brownies, pastries, chocolate dipped frozen fruits, make-your-own-hot-chocolate (Mayan or European style) and all kinds of yummy coffee and chocolate drinks! We ordered a lovely sampling of 3 chocolates to taste with our latte for about $3 and sat at a table overlooking the little plaza. The caf\u00e9 is a wonderful way to relax and enjoy the view of one of the prettiest plazas in Cusco. LEARN: Tour the exhibits and watch a good little film if you'd like to learn about how cacao becomes chocolate; it doesn't take long and I found it pretty interesting. The museum and tastings are all free of charge. They also offer a couple of chocolate making classes (about 2 hours), a \"Bean-to-Bar\" and a truffles and ganache class. I didn't have the time, unfortunately, to take one, but the students who were seemed to be having a great time and producing impressive results! These workshops only cost a little over $20 and you end up with about $10 worth of chocolates to take with you!SHOP: Now, these are my kind of souvenirs! All kinds of chocolates, bags of cacao husk bits to make tea with, nibs, 100% cacao paste to use for making chocolate, chocolate infused Piscos, cacao balls for making hot chocolate, cacao powder, cacao butter for skincare, aprons, earrings and a host of chocolate themed crafts...this is a really fun place to shop for gifts - for small, medium or big budgets!Check it out; you'll be glad you did!"

Somewhat mis-branded as a museum, ChocoMuseo is actually a combination of chocolate shop, cafe, chocolate-making kitchen classes, and a series of educational displays, the latter representing the \"museum\" aspect, and in my view comes very much in fourth place in terms of what the ChocoMuseo has to offer. If you're looking to buy authentic Peruvian chocolates either to eat or for gifts, you probably won't find a better place, although it does very much cater for the tourist market. There's a very wide selection of flavours available. Beverage-wise, in the cafe area at the back, the chocolate tea is interesting, but the best drink on offer must be the hot chocolate. Try to bag a seat, if you can, on the first floor balcony for a nice view over the adjacent square and up the hill towards Sacsayhuaman. However this may be easier said than done as the cafe area is quite small and - at least on our visit - the ChocoMuseo was extremely crowded. The entrance is also a little hard to find: you have to go into a courtyard full of small tour operator kiosks and up some stairs."

The main body of the building is indeed a shop trying to sell everything from cocoa tea (not coca), to solid bars of the good stuff. And it is good.

Considering this as it's main reason for being, our 'guide' didn't have a great level of English, and the talk was a little short.

Out of my traveling group, only myself and one other person was interested in the chocolate making class so we ditched the others one evening to take the class here. I have to say, this was definitely their loss. This class was one of the highlights of my trip to Cusco coming in only behind hiking the Inca Trail and Macchu Picchu. The class was very informational, teaching us lots about how cacao is grown as well as the history and evolution of chocolate. As part of the \"evolution of chocolate\" bit of the course, you get to try three different drinks that represent how chocolate was originally consumed by the pre-Columbian cultures. After going through the steps of transforming a cacao seed/pod into chocolate, you get to make and flavor your own chocolate bars. After the class, you have to come back at least 45 minutes later to pick up your chocolate. We were a bit concerned about this as technically that meant the store would be closed before our chocolates were ready and we were leaving at 5 the morning to hike the Inca Trail. But turns out, if you take the last class of the day (4pm) you can come back after hours to pick up your chocolate. I believe they gave us until 7:30 that evening to return. Our class was filled with people in the young adult age range, but I think that was just coincidence as I'd recommend this class for people of all ages, including children. If we had had more time in Cusco, I would have come back for one of their truffle making courses. That is how awesome this experience was. If you like chocolate, consider a class here on your list of \"must do\" things in Cusco!"

Some of us did a 2 hour bean to bar session and it was definitely worth the 70 Sols. You can wander through the displays and the products available make great gifts to bring home.I would definitely recommend making time to visit in Cusco or Miraflores, Lima."

There is a separate store around the corner from the museum that we went to first. The actual museum is full of information and goods to purchase. They offer classes to make your own chocolate as well but we didn't have enough time during our stay. The cocoa tea is delicious as are the chocolates we sampled and purchased. As with most Peruvian businesses, they have several employees around that offer samples and information about the store and its products and everyone spoke English very clearly. It's worth a visit while in the beautiful city of Cusco!"

Back at the kitchen, there's all sorts of preparation activities: washing, dicing, slicing. Maracuya sours are fun and delicious. We make creamed corn and lomo saltado. While we eat dinner the chef prepares a decadent fruit and chocolate fondue.

The admission is free since the inside is the store with their chocolate and little plaques around the building talking about the history, which was very interesting since I knew nothing about Peruvian chocolate, but I think you had to pay for the tour. If you do have the opportunity to do the tour, do it!! The introduction was more about the history and seeing a real cocoa tree, and afterwards you spent about 1.5 hours making chocolate drinks and your own chocolate. I was more interested in making our own chocolate than the drinks because I wasn't very fond of the drinks. Making your own chocolate was one of the best experiences out of our whole trip though -- you get to pick from milk or dark chocolate and what kind of template you want (little chocolate balls, big \"jumbo bars\", different shapes), and then there's about 20 different toppings including oreo, M&Ms, peanuts, raisins, sprinkles, etc. I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Cusco, especially if you love chocolate!"

One can come here for the shop of chocolate products, or for the small cafe of chocolate drinks and sweets, with its its windows open to the square below, or to take classes (with a fee). I have done all the above and recommend any of them. Note: although there is a small shop on the first floor around the corner, the main Choco Museo is on the second floor (and I don't know if there are any elevators in the building). The workshop class is about 2 hours long and costs about 70 soles ($25). The docent teaches the class (3 in my group) how the cacao grows and is harvested and then the class becomes a hands on endeavor. We tasted raw beans (with a damp, white, watermelon flavored coating) and then peeled and roasted a portion. After that, she made three different cocoa drinks for us: tea made from the shells (gentle and tasty), a Mayan recipe, with chili peppers, and a traditional Spanish recipe, with sugar and milk. Next, we saw how the chocolate beans are processed to make a delicious chocolate puree for cooking. Each of us chose either 42% or 70% chocolate, a plastic tray of shapes, and mixed our chocolate with a variety of toppings. My husband, who is by no means a cook, loved this experience. While we waited for the chocolates to cool and harden, we enjoyed a delicious brownie and hot chocolate in the cafe. The shop also offers cooking classes (for dinner, not chocolate alone) which include a trip to the local market to select the ingredients. I have signed up for that, too, (120 soles, about $40). The shop is owned by a French company which has several other Choco Museos in the region, one in Lima and others in surrounding countries."

Visited for free samples and some chocolate history education as part of a Cusco free walking tour, then stayed on for a 2hr chocolate making course. Cost was 70sol per person, but we got a 5% discount with the 'D card' given to us as part of the walking tour. The class runs daily at 11am, 1.30pm and 4pm and goes for about 2hrs. Manuel was our head chocolate chef for the class, and he took us through the interesting history of chocolate, cacoa facts, and the steps of making chocolate, in a really entertaining, fun way. His English was great, as was his sense of humour, so we got along and could understand him well. During the 2hrs, we got hands on with roasting and grinding cacao beans, got to taste different chocolate products throughout, including a traditional Mayan spicy chocolate drink (which we helped to make), and we got to get creative with pouring chocolate and other ingredients into our own chocolate moulds at the end of the class. The delicious smell of being in this museum/cafe/shop/workshop kitchen really made me wanna eat chocolate, so, luckily, we got to pick up our own hand-made 120g of chocolate 1hr after the class (when it had set), and I couldn't wait to try it! If you're a chocolate lover, or just wanna do something a bit different, I would highly recommend this class! Also, if you just want to buy a chocolate treat or snack, the brownies, hot chocolates, and fruit covered in chocolate all looked amazing!"

They gave some more information on history and production, then let you go through some of the steps of production. There were many samples of teas and hit chocolate which were all great, and of course they then let you pour some into molds and bring it home. Considering the cost of the chocolate, the value of what you take home almost pays for the class. Can't say enough about how great a time we had. Plus their chocolate is organic and fair trade. Not to get on a high horse, but do some research on child slavery in the chocolate trade and you'll never buy a Hershey bar again. The fact that these guys are using high quality raw material and doing almost all the work in house is reason enough in my mind to support them as much as possible."

It's more of a chocolate store, with great marketing and some educational items on the walls. It's not sloppily done or anything. The educational material is actually very interesting, from the history of chocolate to the steps in the manufacturing process. The fake cacao tree is neat too. My wife did not care for the free sample of chocolate tea, but I thought it was interesting.Ultimately though, it's a cafe. The desserts are probably great, but we only bought a couple small truffles. They were both good. The classes on making your own chocolate look fun too, but I didn't want to spend hours doing that when I was on vacation in Peru. It's fun enough to spend an hour or so. Probably better if you've got the money and calories to spend on dessert."

Here we did order some hot chocolate, which was the highlight of the experience.

You order and receive food and drinks at your table, then go to the counter to pay. It all works on an honesty system, and sometimes the paper dockets with your order don't seem to migrate to the counter at all, so be careful when you are paying your bill. The second time we went, the couple in the queue before me had not paid for their food, only their purchases, and because my docket had not turned up at all, it took some time to convince the assistant that I had not ordered the couple's food as well as my own (ie that I should not have to pay for it).Otherwise, a lovely place and I highly recommend."

It is fantastic fun and very interesting. You will learn about how the cocoa brands are grown and fermented. But then you get to roast, shell, and grind the beans. Along the way you get to try chocolate tea and a couple of hot chocolates. You learn about how the chocolate is further processed before making your own. Pick a chocolate mould tray and from about 25 different ingredients ranging from cinnamon to Smarties to nuts, you make your own chocolates. Come back an hour later and they Arter yours to enjoy.We booked for the 11 am class and were the only two people. Maybe that was luck our the first class of the day gets you a more private experience.GREAT FUN"

Also a good place to grab a couple souvenirs; tried free sample of choco tea, ended up leaving with bag of it and some bars :) If you're not gonna eat or drink, or participate in a chocolate activity in the kitchen, you're looking at 15 minutes tops; enter from side of building and inside the plaza--steps up only to second floor, methinks."

Unfortunately, we came at a busy time so we were left out in the busy shuffle. The classes that they offered here were kind of pricey so we did not sign up. Also, we were heading to Hershey PA on a 3 day trip after Peru with a few chocolate making classes planned & paid for, so it would have made them redundant.

The whole museum takes up the space of a small apartment, spread over several levels. You get some chocolate tea on arrival (actually quite good, then you're on your own unless you want to buy their products or take a chocolate making session). If you have any mobility issues, I don't suggest even trying this (too many stairs). You can take a course in chocolate making (70 soles - $25.00), but it is quite expensive, you don't make much (more watching and listening than doing) or just buy some of their chocolate products. Their products are very tasty, but you will find just as good and much more choices in almost any store in Cusco and for a much cheaper price."

We got to sample 3 chocolate drinks and saw how to make them, as well as the fun of making our own chocolate inspired treats! it was so much fun and the information I got from it was awesome!

We were very pleasantly surprised and had what we would describe as one of the best experiences of our time in Cusco. Our host Gladys was very informative and very entertaining - cracking little jokes all the time. At the end of the chocolate making you have an hour to fill in while your chocolate sets.

A discount coupon to the Chocolate Museum gets thrust in your hands at the Plaza de Arms in Cusco, Peru - just a few short blocks from the chocolate museum. Being tired and ready for a treat, I ambled over to the place. Nothing prepared me for what a delicious and informative surprise awaited inside.Being a bit \"touristed out\" - and hungry and tired, I immediately opted for the day's special: Hot chocolate and chocolate-banana bread. Both were superlative. The hot chocolate was uniquely served: A generous dish of what looked like chocolate pudding: The waitress said that was to mix with the accompanying aqua caliente (hot water) in a pot. I had 3 generous cups of hot chocolate from this combo.The banana-chocolate cake bread was rich and also very generous sized portion.Both were served on nice dishes (no styrofoam cups!).I asked if wifi was available. Just like Starbucks, I was given a slip of paper with the secret password! Took out my little chromebook, and caught up with the news from home and friends while feasting in very lovely and pleasant surroundings. I sat in a big overstuffed very comfy chair, looking out the balcony window into a park.I would have opted for one of the two balcony windows, but both were full during my entire 2 hour visit.After getting refreshed and caught up with the news, I toured the quite well presented exhibits. They were all information story cards with good pictures and big print, so no squinting required to read in the soft light.There was a life-size model of a cocoa tree, and also beans and pods to freely touch and handle to get familiar with cocoa - from seed to goodies.There was no hustle to purchase anything. The museum is free. The coupon gives a small discount. The atmosphere was very friendly and slightly on the party side with all the tourists enjoying various chocolate goodies, and gathering info.There were classes offered by friendly staff, and lots of interesting choco items to purchase if so inclined.They also give a free very unique and extra delicious cocoa tea when you arrive (cocoa de mate). It was extraordinarily delicious. You can purchase some leaves to take out (but remember you cannot bring cocoa leaves in ANY form into the USA.)I definitely recommend this excellent attraction to my friends visiting Cusco, Peru.Yum! Yum! Yum.... 10+ Yum Stars for the Chocolate Museum :)"

We got an overview of chocolate in South America, and then we started making our own. It was a great experience to roast and mash the cacao beans ourselves. We made three drinks with it and then used a different chocolate (already tempered) to make chocolate bars or pieces. I would highly recommend this to anyone."

Didn't realise when we turned up at 11:10 am that there were only three time options - 11am, 1:30 and 4:00 pm. First was booked so we opted for last one to get some shopping in. At this point I will mention that we were still exhausted after doing the inca trail yesterday. The tour is 2 hrs long and you stand the entire time. It was fully booked and that was too many people - they should have restricted each workshop to no more than 8-10 people (we had about 15?). The first half hour was talk about the tree the beans come from. The room was hot and thick with the scent of chocolate (initially not so unpleasant). The next hour was hands on with the beans and we made two drinks with the bean paste. Interesting, but not to my pallet. So what was left was only half an hour to fill molds with pre-tempered chocolate and flavours. The shop shuts at 6:30 but you have to come back an hour later to get your goodies. The door to the complex in which the museo was located was shut and we were lucky someone came through while we stood trying to work out how to get in. My suggestion is to avoid the last session and don't do it if you're really tired already. I LOVE chocolate but I was not enjoying myself. If you've made chocs before you will be disappointed that the molds are the flimsy plastic ones not proper hard/durable ones and you don't learn how to temper it or produce a really top quality product (appearance wise). If you've never made choc and are just generally interested in the process this is the one for you."

Smiley Gladys was our chocolate-making teacher, and not only she guided us on the task of making chocolate from scratch, she also gave us a crash course on the origins of chocolate and the historic use of cocoa beans. After a brief introduction supported by the exhibits on the museum, we were all hands in action!We started by preparing and tasting different drinks prepared with cocoa beans. Then, we proceeded to make our own chocolate, from toasting the beans, grinding and mashing them\u2026 until we molded our own chocolate mixes with nuts, spices, and a lot of other \"toppings\" provided to add your personality to your treats.We had such a great time making chocolate with our group and Gladys and, of course, tasting different treats at the Museum as well. Their chocolate is top notch, particularly the bitter one: dark, so intense and sustainable, as it is locally grown.I'd absolutely recommend a visit to Cusco's Chocolate Museum when you are in town. You can buy a lot of chocolate related products in their shop (movies, toiletries, condoms, merchandise, jewelry made with cocoa beans), you can also have a sweet treat form their menu (coffee as well!) and, of course, take a class to enlighten you in the beauty of the chocolate making art. Loved it!"

The storage space for your belongings is under the counter where the workshop takes place. It's fairly safe, as I would assume that people who leave things typically only pick up their own things.

After looking to past chocolate publicity and reading some interesting facts clearing out misconceptions that we still have about chocolate (that it causes acne, cavities,etc...) the only thing you want to do is get a taste of this adictive product. They offer 2 specialty hot chocolates: Mayan or European style. Both are served in a \"build your own chocolate\" style. With the mayan they bring you the milk, the melted chocolate in another glass and in another recipient the secret ingredient: \"aji picante\". I lived in Mexico quite a time and learned that hot chili can be mixed with everyhting, so I loved this combination! Plus, since it comes separated you can control the amount of heat you want in it. My friend ordered the European which is a more classic option. The chocolate and milk are served separated as well so you can mix, but instead of \"aji picante\" the additional ingredients are cinnamon sticks and cloves. Both were delicious and perfect to help you deal with the cold weather. Please don't forget to accompany your chocolate with their specialty breads: raisin stuffed & chocolate stuffed. Both melt in your mouth! They are so good we went twice to get them!They offer chocolate workshops where they teach you how to transform the cocoa into the yummy chocolate bars we eat. I would have loved to take them, but they last 2 hours and we were tight in time.They sell all sorts of chocolate. A little expensive, but way delicious!

We found a huge variety of flavors such as Lucuma, Coca, and Sauco which are tipical fruits and/ or products of the area. Also, every visitor has the change to take a class to produce his or her own chocolate which was awesome."

Three of us went to the 4pm class on a Saturday afternoon and found it informative, hands-on and fun, if a little hot at times. There were six in the class in all, 5 English and 1 Spanish speaking; this did mean the explanations/instructions had to be given in 2 languages. Six is a good number for getting everything done on time, and if you go to the 4pm class you do need to come back about 7pm (or the next morning) to collect the chocolates you have made once they have 'set'; there are lots of shapes and fillings available for you to 'design your own' chocolates. I found it a well run and imaginative diversion from the 'standard' sightseeing attractions, fun for any age/sex. There is a lovely smell of good quality chocolate, the staff are welcoming, polite and well trained and you drink chocolate tea and hot chocolate you have had a hand in making. There is a little cafe and chocolate museum on the same floor, and both standard and unusual chocolate items are available for purchase."

We decided to pay a visit and it looked brilliant and we thought we'd give chocolate making a go!. So we waited an hour and paid our \u00a320 each and went back. They crammed so many of us in and had to translate in Spanish and English so the whole thing over ran and we got hotter and hotter crammed into the kitchen. We were given tasks to do and tea to drink that we had made with the shells, unfortunately they didn't wash the cups and everyone had to drink out of dirty cups which made us feel sick. The tops of the counters were filthy and people were able to come in and watch us working and breathing over us whilst making our chocolate. People were blowing their noses and sticking fingers into the chocolate which they expected us to then make into bars of chocolate for ourselves to eat. People were fighting over the flavours to add to the chocolate as their wasn't enough to go round. After making the chocolate you have to spend another hour and 20 minutes waiting for it. We had to wait for ours as we were leaving Cusco in the morning, but they had shut the kitchen and would not even make us a drink. We had a headache and were really tired by the time we got the chocolate which hadn't even set. The idea is good, but the place isn't hygienic at all, so many people washing their hands and using the same handtowel to dry them, even the actual chocolate makers themselves were using the same surfaces to make the chocolate sold in the shop. Everyone is allowed to wonder in the kitchen to have a look, hair, dirty hands, blowing noses, the lot in a food preparation area. We thought it would have been a good idea because we had seen the plants in the Amazon and thought it brilliant to see the end product, very saddened by staff that didn't care about people once they had your money and didn't care about customer satisfaction. Disgraceful attitudes, dirty and unhygienic and a lot of money, I wish I would have checked it out more before going back to make the chocolate. I thought they would have been more careful about who goes in the kitchen."

Indigenous to the Americas, the cocoa tree and its associated seeds are used here as a springboard to educate and inform tourists about the history and making of chocolate. We signed up for a \u201cbean-to-bar\u201d workshop previous to visiting and arrived about 30 minutes early to see the museum. The ground floor starts the process, covering the use of cocoa by the Mayans and Aztecs and explaining its introduction into the Old World and role on both sides of the Atlantic with an emphasis on religion. The scope of the topic is a bit broad obviously, but I learned quite a bit going through the explanations.The workshop followed, starting with a quick didactic session on the upper floor with a life-sized model of a cocoa tree. Growing and harvesting are explained and we were then brought downstairs in the kitchen to start working. The workshop lasted a little over an hour and was exactly as advertised: from bean to bar. Longer parts of the chocolate-making process like fermentation and refining were explained on a theoretical basis, while aspects such as roasting, winnowing, and grinding the bean were completed by the group. Two types of chocolate drink were made using ingredients we had just processed, then \u201crefined\u201d chocolate was brought out and we made small candies with additional ingredients like nuts, salt, sprinkles (think Maggie Moos or Stone Cold Creamery but using chocolate and not ice cream\u2026. Yeah it\u2019s that decadent). These were then stored to be cooled until pick-up later that night or the following day. There is a store and caf\u00e9 for purchasing the usual items during regular business hours as well.This was an enjoyable experience and I think the above title of the review sums up the process accurately. The only issues I had with the workshop was that our preceptor seemed a bit new on the job (and more interested in flirting with the college girls in our group) but a more experienced colleague helped with the process to smooth things out a bit. Additionally, we came back to pick up our treats later that night and the door was locked. After several phone calls from local businesses we were let in to retrieve our results. Fortunately both of these issues were fairly minor when viewed in the context of the entire afternoon. Thumbs up on this visit and recommended for all age groups."

It's a very complete package: museum about chocolate production through history, cafe to drink chocolate tea and hot chocolate, chocolate making workshops, eco tours to visit cacao farms, and a little shop to buy chocolates, organic coffee (bought several packets of this. It's very good!) and chocolate memorabilia. I learned a lot from the museum and then visited two more times for the chocolate making workshops, once just for fun and once with a group of students I was teaching.The workshop was in English the first time and Spanish the second. It costs S/. 70 per person (but ask for discounts for groups) and lasts two or three hours (add the time that it takes for the chocolate to set in the refrigerator.) If you take the class at night you'll need to come back the next morning to pick up your finishedWe learned about the entire process of chocolate production from the cacao tree and pod to how to make my own pieces of chocolate with different additions like peanuts, chilli powder, and cinnamon. The teachers had great English and were patient as we tried our hand at roasting the cacao seeds and ground them to paste. It was very engaging and fun and the end result was delicious. One negative experience was that when my mom and dad did the class, my dad went back to get his chocolates and they'd been given away to another customer. All that time and attention to make his very own chocolates and he never got to enjoy them. Instead they gave him someone else's. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place if you need a fun activity while you acclimate to the altitude."

The perfect mixture of learning, culture and fun!! We did the afternoon workshop which started by sipping chocolate tea while reading about the history of cocoa...then you get a small tour followed by the chocolate making workshop. This takes you from bean to chocolate - really interesting!! The best bit was when you got to make your own combination of chocolates - you can get pretty creative! I would highly recommend this experience to anyone visiting Cusco - it was one of my favourite things and a nice break from all things Inca!!!"

Yes, they give a brief review of history of Cacao/Chocolate making, and the history is displayed as exhibition on the walls, but we also learned about today's cacao bean 'farming' in Peru, and some facts about the bean's handling from harvesting through the processes to the ready product.We learned that the quality Peruvian organic grown cacao is highly valued in the world marked.The entrance to ChocoMuseo is free; one only pays for participating in chocolate making class. And we were lucky, somebody on the plaza next to the Museum gave us a discount vouchers to the class. We as a group of three participated in the fun chocolate making class in April this year. We had a lovely and enthusiastic instructor, Gladys, who made the whole experience even more fun. She is a happy person, nice to be around. In fact she was sweeter than the chocolate we made:). We had some competition in grinding toasted cocoa beans, made Mayan hot chocolate, and own our chocolate. After the class we enjoyed a hot drink by a window overlooking the plaza, next to which the ChocoMuseo is located on a second floor of an old building. The whole class was truly fun, and we got something special - self made chocolate - to take home too. Also, one can buy the toasted cacao bean shells/husks in nice size packages to take home. We tasted the tea made from these organic & shade grown, fermented husks, and it was delicious \u2013 I ended up buying a couple of packages. Organic grown coffee beans are also on sale. All in all, it was a time well spent in ChocoMuseo, and I would like to recommend it to anyone, young and not so young!"

We decided to take the chocolate making workshop at the Choco Museo.There is really a lot of information here - the history of chocolate cultivation and use, the various types of cacao plants, and the process of turning cacao pods into chocolate.The workshop starts with cacao beans that have already been removed from the pod and fermented. (This takes too long to do during the class.) In class, you roast the beans, separate the nibs from the hulls, and grind the nibs into cacao paste with a mortar and pestle. The teacher makes some traditional drinks from the paste and everyone gets to try some.Then it jumps to prepared cacao that has been ground for 24 hours in a commercial mechanical grinder. You choose fillings for your chocolate candies and pour the prepared chocolate into the molds with the fillings. You come back about an hour later to pick up your chilled and solidified chocolate. It's very good chocolate!The staff was very friendly and helpful. Ours was the last workshop of the day, so they had to stay late until we came back to pick up our chocolate candies."

The kids and I had done a chocolate making tour with a micro shop in Costa Rica so we had high expectations, and we were mostly satisfied. ChocoMuseo took us through the entire production process: we roasted the beans, shelled them by hand, crushed them (my 9 yo son loved the mortar & pestle competition!). During each step we tasted various drinks made from the cocoa bean or husk products (tea, etc) making the drinks ourselves. In the end, we poured our own chocolate bars after selecting mix-in ingredients like mint or peanuts (we chose from over a dozen items). The end result is delicious and we are still enjoying he chocolate bars days later. The only shortcoming in comparison to our Costa Rica tour is the lack of fresh cacao bean pods to sample; you simply must try tarting the fruit jelly that surrounds fresh unroasted cacao beans, the flavor rivals passion fruit for sweetness!ChocoMuseo is located only a few blocks off Plaza de Armas in Cusco, it's a bright and airy shop with plenty of chocolate options to purchase, great bathrooms - our kids went there from our restaurant they were so clean - and a variety of additional local touting options available. If you can find your way here, it should rank as a Cusco must-do activity."

We have done a few food workshops around the world and this one is great and very reasonably priced for what it is.The lady who does the workshop is very knowledgeable and speaks excellent English. You learn all about cacao and how it is processed. Then you roast some beans and grind them. With the cacao liquor that it produces, you then make two different drinks. You make a Mayan cacao drink and a Spanish chocolate drink. You also get to have a cacao tea made from the husks of the beans. You learn about the pressing process and the chocolate making process. After this you get to make your own chocolate bars/pieces with a variety of flavours. You go back an hour later to pick up your chocolate.I cannot recommend this place highly enough. We did the workshop and also came here twice for hot chocolate (delicious). The workshop takes almost exactly two hours and is a great break from Inca stuff."

We had so much great chocolate to take home. They also had a note that they do cooking classes, so you may want to inquire about that as well.

From the time you open the door and the smell has everyone swooning to when you leave with your own hand made chocolates, the entire two hours is fast paced, infinitely fascinating in the history, and always hands-on.  The folks here know how to interact with all age groups. Lots of touching the ingredients, tasting them, playing with them, and all in a homey setting. What a great place, and as a history teacher, I loved how they explained the history of chocolate, showed a cocao tree with pods, and made every part of the tour fascinating and super sensory."

My wife and I did the workshop and Alain was enthusiastic, energetic (must be from all the chocolate), informative, fun and hilarious. As much as learning the process of making chocolate and actually making/tasting chocolates made it fun, Alain made the experience with his personality. Experience drinking cacao as the Mayans/Incans did...then in the more modern and palatable way. The museum portion is informative and the workshop is enjoyable and informative. Alain is something to be experienced.Make sure you have time 2 hours or so after the workshop to pick up the chocolates you make."

Lovely place, very good idea and excellent hot chocolate and what a surprise to know the origins of the owner parents, Portugal, that says all."

They take you through the entire chocolate making process, letting you taste it along the way and wrapping up with creating you very own chocolates. They are in a great location, overlooking the square. Even if you don't sign up for the workshop you should stop by for a hot chocolate on the balcony."

            "review": "A Visit to Paradise. I spent two days and one night at the home of Julia and Jose, coffee farmers in the Quillabamba area. Choco Museo arranged the tour and provided a Spanish and English-speaking guide who was perfectly suited to my personality. Julia, Jose, and family made me feel at home. In addition, I received quite an education; they showed me coffee, tea, fruits, and medicinal plants around their home. The accomodations were perfectly comfortable and meals very tasty. I hope to visit these people again and would not hesitate to use Choco Museo to make the arrangements. The only negative part of the trip is the drive time from Cuzco. If taking public transportation, visitors should be certain to empty their bladder before leaving on the journey."

            "review": "Believe The Reviews & Hype - Amazingly Fun & Educational Experience!. Visited while in Cusco with family last week and all I can say is...WOW! Great cafe with delicious drinks, chocolate, snacks et al -- but far more in terms of the history, use and making of all things chocolate.Truly a novel and fun experience for all ages -- whether a family with young kids (would say 7 and up); single or young couples, or older travelers. We took the 3-hour chocolate making taller (workshop) which was awesome. Lead by Alain, who is hilarious and a true pleasure/joy to be around, everyone in our group had a blast -- and learned how to make chocolate from scratch. This was a surprise highlight of our most recent visit to Cusco. If you have a few hours of downtime in Cusco (after/before the trail, before a flight et al.) -- based on our experience, we could not recommend a visit to the ChocoMuseo more highly. If you have the time, sign up for the taller -- you won't be disappointed - you'll leave in hand with Chocolate you've made from scratch -- and a will have had a blast at the same time."

The museum is free and offers samples of some of the most delicious chocolate in the world, and it is all locally made. The owners are fun, friendly and so helpful and offer all the chocolates you want! There is educational information and chocolates to buy. There is also delicious coffee and hot chocolate. It is something completely different from what you'd expect to see while sightseeing. We were there only 5 days after it opened, and everything was delicious, unique and unforgettable. Lonely Planet and other travel guides WILL notice this soon enough, but get in on the action before it becomes the most popular spot in Cusco."

We knew that the factory was very new, but we didn't expect to have such a professonal operation, since we knew that it been open only about 3 weeks. But the young French couple who run the museum/workshop had the entire operation down to a science, having build a similar museum operation in Nicaragua. Our guide was an incredibly friendly American, a trained chocolate maker who studied in New York, who walked us through the entire operation of chocolate making, from roasting and husking through to pouring the finished chocolates into the moulds and helping us select the ingredients to add to help us customize our chocolates (raisons, nuts, etc). It was an amazing afternoon. Highly recommended!"

We visited ChocoMuseo whilst in Cusco, we were amazed at the Museo, very professional and some to die for chocolate drinks! We didn't get the chance to do a chocolate making workshop, but from watching some other workshop attendees they were loving it - plus they got to take home their own chocolate!I would mark this as a must for any visitor to Cusco!!!!Muy Bien!!"

A great introduction to the chocolate industry with very knowledgeable and friendly staff. We participated in the chocolate making workshop which was great value, being able to take home the goods we made. Their product range is focused on dark chocolate, although there is vision to expand their range as the company grows. Great location and inviting modern shop, highly recommended!"

It is not only a Museum but you can also buy chocolates, drink hot chocolate (they have many tioes of that one), and even drink a chocolate tee. The place is very well located and it is really cozy, te prices are reasonable, the service is really good they took the time to talk about the museum and to answer all of our questions about the place and the chocolates they sell, they also where asking us if we where ok with everything, the place smells amazing and I think it is imposible to walk in to this place and do not buy chocolate or feel happier than usual because it smells so good and of course to see the museum you do not need to do any payment but if you are a chocolate lover you are for sure buying or drinkink something in the Choco Museum."

That seems respectfull.You should go and spend 2 hours in the kitchen.Recommanded, good surprise !Vincent, Fce"
