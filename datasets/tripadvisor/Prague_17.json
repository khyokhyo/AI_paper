As I didn't have enough time to visit the Jewish cemetery, museum and all the synagogues in the Jewish Quarter, I was happy to pay the reasonable admission price of 70 coruna to see just the Spanish Synagogue. This impressive synagogue is the \"youngest\" in the city, built in the 1800's. The style of the interior is beautiful and ornate, unlike any I have seen. Ideally I would have liked to linger and take in the atmosphere at a quiet time, but I was there in the afternoon and unfortunately there were noisy tour groups going in and out. There was a small shop selling books and artefacts, and I purchased a small inexpensive book on \"Jewish Prague\" as well as several books by Franz Kafka.This synagogue is definitely worth a visit, and there are staff there to provide information."

Ornate interior with a very good display of documents, ornate silverware and personal effects from members of the Jewish community. I was appalled at the ignorant (in both senses of the word) behaviour of some of the tour groups. Talking and laughing in what is a place of worship and remembrance. Most didn't bother looking at the displays or bother talking to the informative staff who were there. To be frank I was a bit disappointed that staff didn't intervene and ask people who behave badly to leave. It's the type of person who later boasts \"Oh yeah we did the Spanish Synagogue\". Take some time afterwards to explore the Jewish area and pause in the shady seating areas, a world away from the madness that is Charles Bridge."

I understood that there were to be no videos taken and thought I was okay with a wide angle photo as there were many other people using digital cameras and cell phones taking pictures. The older woman attendant came rushing at me yelling and shaking her finger and saying no video. I tried to explain it was only a photo and she kept saying the same thing over and over and wouldn't let me explain, her voice getting louder like I was arguing with her, pointing at the sign saying no video cameras. I said okay, I got it. When I went into the next room she followed me suspiciously. I took out the iPad and went to open it to show it was only a photo and again she yelled at me NO VIDEO!! People in the room all looked to see what the commotion was about and I felt like a criminal. I finally just turned and left the building, her following me. It spoiled the whole experience for me and I deleted the photo as I knew I could never look at it without being reminded how unpleasant this experience was and how I felt. I asked the people with me what they thought and they said she was rude and over the top and no need for that kind of behaviour."

I thought I would be able to stroll around at my own pace and spend time looking at each of the buildings and learning more about the history of the area. Each of the buildings was packed to full capacity which made it quite uncomfortable in the heat. There is only one venue to buy your tickets from and the queues are very long you can gain access from the street behind but only to walk along the streets. You can't just visit the cemetery you have to buy a multiple tour ticket which makes the tour expensive for what it is. I left with the impression that this is just a money making exercise and the staff at times were quite rude to visitors who didn't understand the ticket concept to gain entry."

This is one of six sites of the Jewish Museum complex which also includes the Old/New synagogue - part of which dates back to the 1200s, the old Jewish cemetery, another Ashkenazi synagogue, and ritul museum.This particular site is no longer in active use as a synagogue due to the absence of sufficient remaining Sephardic Jews to form a viable congregation. It contains a well-organized and documented exhibit of ritual items from all major functions of an active synagogue ( most from other liquidated synagogues) and also several historical documents and commentaries. Because this synagogue was used by the Nazis as a storehouse for all the ritual items looted from other synagogues, this building was not destroyed as many others were. While neglected by the Communists that followed, they, too, also did not raize the building as they did to many others.Of note to those visitors from countries with prominant Jewish populations such as Israel, parts of the USA, Britain, many of the ritual items and their explanations may seem surprisingly basic - especially to Jews themselves (like our family). However, the tour groups we saw appeared to be mostly young people from Germany and Spain, and some middle-aged people from France. It occured to us that many of those people had little exposure to Jews in their daily life, so that this basic information was necessary to give them an idea of what the practice of Judaism even is. I have never, for example, seen a church in Europe that gives basic explanations regarding Catholic or Protestant church services, rituals, or beliefs. That fact is, in itself, quite sobering."

That changes almost immediately upon entering the synagogue. My eyes were drawn first to the high walls ascending to the ornate ceiling and skylight (the heavens as it were), and in any direction, spectacular beauty simultaneously adorns what is a reverent place. Along the walls are cases containing texts, historical documents, scripture and the personal items and stories of past members of Prague's Jewish community, gradually revealing the history of the Jewish experience in Prague over the coarse of many centuries, a tale recited in a subtle and somber, yet factual manner. A trip upstairs reveals artifacts that may be considered the \"Treasury\" of the synagogue and local Jewish community - a fine, and extensive, collection of mostly silver items relevant to the synagogue, its religious rites & celebrations, its rabbis, and its congregants. The gold and silver evident throughout, however, did not appear to represent decadence or wealth; it related, at least to me, the respect and reverence that the community had for its church, it's leaders, and its place of worship - a symbolic offering. I left impressed, and educated. See how you interpret it !!!"

Moorish.When you remember that Spain was conquered by the Omayyad and occupied till the middle ages no wonder the style is so Moorish .. .and it is beautiful.From outside the synagogue is not tempting at all.But when you get inside ...

Obviously, this is a matter of taste. The program on any given evening is not limited to 'classical' or 'opera' selections: Bach, Mozart, Rossini, Verdi, etc, but includes works by Bernstein, Gershwin, Cohen, etc. It was a marvelous mix and I must say that the soprano ( a Ms. Srumova, I believe) was fantastic.

This beautiful Spanish Synagogue does an excellent job marketing their concerts and it is easy to buy tickets on-line which is good to do if you want to attend a concert since the seating is very limited . I did just that and then eagerly anticipated the Gershwin concert which I would be attending .I agree with everyone about the beauty of the interior of this sanctuary . It's moorish style is very similar to the Central Synagogue in Manhattan . However the concert itself was disappointing . There were 5 musicians whom seemed to be going through their paces without any enthusiasm . Their renditions of the popular Gershwin songs was nothing special and exactly 60 minutes after they started they were finished . Yes applause brought them back for one more song . Twenty six USD seems expensive to me for such a short concert in Prague . Although I was quite happy to contribute to the financial well bring of this Synagogue I feel that in a city like Prague where wonderful music seems to ooze out of every corner of the city , this concert should have had some passion ."

Don't miss the large silver collection on the second floor, off to the left as you go up the stairs.You can also visit by attending one of the regularly held evening concerts, though you would have less opportunity to wander about.

There is 2 small bathrooms on the 2nd floor and a small shop near the entrance."

It was so beautiful, that it was difficult to absorb, and even more difficult to finally take my eyes off of it, and remove myself from the surroundings. Could be my strong attraction to the style of architecture. It was part of a ticket that included 6 or 7 sites in the Old Jewish Quarter, remarkably including the 13th century Old-New Synagogue, which is a working synagogue, the old cemetery, and several other synagogues. The other synagogues are museums and concert halls now; not a lot of people to use them after WWII. I didn't know what I was walking into when I entered the Pinkas Synagogue, until I focused my eyes on the pattern on the white walls and felt my breath leave me. In calligraphy the names, birthdates, transport dates, for 78,000 Jews of Bohemia and Moravia. The walls of the entire synagogue were covered in this manner, so to give a different perspective, how many walls, in how large a building, would it take for 6 million names? In summary, the Spanish Synagogue is an architectural gem, but it is just a small part, and a much later part of the story of the Old Jewish Quarter. The visit isn't free, and why should it be? For those who travel to actually see, learn, and appreciate, a visit to the Jewish museums will be an enjoyable and valuable experience. They are museums, they require time and thought. For those who hold up a cell phone, take a photo, and think you've seen something, then go to the next site, and want it all for free, probably you wouldn't enjoy these spaces."

Of course the design is based upon the Moorish buildings of southern Spain and North Africa, apparently I was told by the tour guide that this is a really popular building for Muslim tourists, because of it's incredible similarity to a mosque. It certainly looks that way, and really stands differently amongst the Czech grandeur that surrounds it here in the Jewish quarter, definitely worth a visit."

If you've traveled to Granada or Cordoba in southern Spain, you'll recognize the Moorish influence that is also found there. Oddly, however, this synagogue has no particular connection to Spain or Spanish Jews. There is some debate about how this site acquired its name, though the design aspect of it is a likely link. It was interesting to learn that during WWII the Nazis used the building as a warehouse to store property they had confiscated from the Jewish population of Prague. In any case, the interior of the synagogue is fabulous! Intricate designs dazzle the eye! There are interesting case displays relating to the history of Jews in Prague, but it's really the ornateness of the interior that is why this is a \"must-see\". If you have purchased a ticket for the New Jewish Synagogue and Jewish Cemetery, your admission to the Spanish Synagogue and a couple of other sites is included. Take advantage of it -- you won't be disappointed!Highly Recommended!"

It's a new building: After WWII what had been the ghetto became slums, and the synagogue was rebuilt when the Czech government had much of the area razed and reconstructed to make the neighborhood appealing again, or so I've been told. It is gorgeous, and the gallery holds a small but very touching memorial to the Jews of Prague, both before the war and during. This synagogue is accessible with the 300 crown combined ticket. It's a place I would love to see again, and definitely where I'd go for services if I lived in Prague."

The interiors too were very pretty though different from the churches one comes across in this part of the world.

Prague was always very important in Jewish history, so it was natural for us - family with Jewish roots - not to miss this part. We wanted to get more from our visit, so we decided for Anna Kristyna Sion to be our guide. Eventually we recognised it was the best decision we made, because without her, we will never feel that we really understood the story of Jews in Czech lands. She does her own research and studies going deeper to the core of Judaism and also making and filming interviews with holocaust survivors with her colleague and mentor Pavel Batel (whom we hired to take as to Terezin). Her personal interest and connection to this subject is admirable. She pointed us so many details and personal stories we wouldn't be able to know or find just wandering around the streets, that made our tour with Anna Kristyna Sion very unique, personal and moving. We can simply say, don't go there without Anna!"

The best of these synagogues is the Spanish Synagogue of Prague. The architecture is marvelous, it is truly one of the most beautiful synagogues I have visited. The gold walls and stained glass windows are truly stunning. The synagogue was not used by Sephardic Jews from Spain, but it was built in a very vibrant Spanish style. Truly a must see while in Prague."

(I would however have preferred they inform you at the ticket booth which locations do and don't allow photography) Now back to the Spanish Synagogue it is a unique and golden place. Ironically you will learn that the Synagogues were used by the Nazis to store their ill gotten gains. A true marvel that sticks out in time and location.

It was initially a bit confusing, trying to understand where things were located, how it was situated, and where we needed to go, but once we spoke with a ticket agent, it all made sense.Josefov was crowded the day we went - all the synagogues, all the museums, even the cemetery were full of tourists. It was great for them, because I'm sure the funds will go a long way in helping to preserve the landmarks, but it made navigating through spaces a bit of a challenge.There were so many great displays within the Spanish Synagogue. They line every wall, and every one of them has a story to tell. Most of the displays had placards with English translations on them, but there were a fair number that did not. You can get a sense of what they're trying to tell you based on the artifact and the surrounding plaques, but there were a lot of gaps in information because of that. I'm not one of those travelers who expects the rest of the world to speak English, but it's confusing that some are translated and some aren't.The architecture and decor within this synagogue were beautiful. There's quite a bit to see - two levels worth, as a matter of fact - and though it can get crowded, it won't feel nearly as pinched as some of the other locations in the area. Definitely worth the time and money, for the history alone, if for nothing else."

It costs 70 CZK and it is absolutely worth it. The only thing I didn't quite understand was that you are not allowed to take photos with a tripod. I guess it's because there are sooo many people and when you use a tripod you block the \"flow\". Which brings me to my next point: It's very crowded. I guess it would be best not to go there on a Sunday. It is closed on Saturday (obviously) and then all weekend travellers go there on Sunday, just as we did. I would assume that it is less crowded during the week but I can't really tell because I was there only during the weekend."

On the second floor is one of the more interesting exhibits of life in the Jewish Quarter (each of the places you visit with the combo ticket has exhibits of some sort). While interesting, my judgment was experience by the fact that you have to purchase an overpriced ticket. I judge the latter by the price of tickets to major sights elsewhere in Prague (this lis far more expensive) and also by European standards generally. When you consider that a ticket to the Vatican Museum, for example, is 16 euros (less than $20 currently) and the cost of this ticket is about $25, it seems unreasonable."

Any visit to Prague should include a few hours in the Jewish Quarter, just a small area of a few blocks that is full of history, architectural beauty, a sense of spirituality and sadness, and a bit of the mystical. Although my family and I are fairly well-versed in the history of European Jews we hired a guide, Anna Krystina Sion, to take us through the Jewish Quarter and found her to be excellent. She quickly assessed our level of knowledge and our areas of interests and was able to fine-tune her discussion of the various sites to that level. I was very impressed with that because many tour guides don't bother to alter their presentations based on the knowledge of their audience. She has a wealth of knowledge, a great deal of detail at her fingertips and an engaging personality. The four synagogues in the Jewish Quarter are each different, lovely in their own way and have singular histories. A Jewish cemetery is poignant and quietly beautiful. This was a morning well-spent and on our next trip we would not hesitate to hire Anna Krystina to accompany us to Terezin--time did not permit us to do that on this trip."

First thing I noticed was that the synagogue was a lot smaller than pictured on the brochure, but that probably allowed the architects to make the interior as detailed as it is. The symmetrical patterns spread across every inch of the synagogue (except the floor) was visually satisfying to my inner-OCD. There were only about 10 pews and they had to set up several extra chairs to accomodate for the audience. The ensemble were 6 members from the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra - violin quintet and a trumpeteer. The concert was technically excellent - great dynamic range and clarity. The acoustics of the synagogue allowed the music to resonate richly, leading me to wonder what it might be like during a worship service. What pleased me the most was the small shared smiles among the experienced ensemble; they really enjoyed making music together.After the short (1hr) concert, we quickly took as many photos of the synagogue interior as the security insisted \"No photos\" and shooed us out. If you can catch the Gershwin concert I recommend it. I'm sure the other classical concerts offered on alternate nights are excellent as well."

The marrying of Moorish design with the synagogue layout was wonderful. The intricate decorations from the walls and ceiling to the lighting were all spectacular. In particular the folding of the Jewish motifs (Star of David) into the designs was subtle and clever. The exhibits were also quite good on the 2nd floor. Come back for a concert in the evening for the wonderful acoustics."

There are no carved statues or frescoes in these synagogues. As in all Jewish houses of worship nothing representational is allowed except depictions of plants and animals: Images of God or the prophets are forbidden. Nonetheless, the Moorish carvings and painted covering the walls are a lavish feast for the eyes and for the spirit.There is an exhibit of Jewish life and death from medieval central Europe to the present. What struck out the most in the Spanish Synagogue was a picture (taken by the Nazis) of a woman unwittingly leading a group of children to the gas chamber.

But if you don't love the above, I'd say come to see the synagogue during its opening hours and ponder it for its beauty and history. If you come just to the concert, not only are you paying 700 CZK, but you are only there for the concert, the exhibits are in darkness and you don't get a chance to really see the Synagogue. To know if the concert is for you, you can find extracts on Youtube. We felt that the musicians were professional but there was no warmth or rapport with the very enthusiastic and appreciative audience. It felt like they were doing once again, what they do for exactly one hour a few times a week. TIP: If you opt to come to the performance, note that the wooden benches are very hard and uncomfortable - bring a pillow or go for the chairs they put out in front of and alongside the benches!"

It was nice viewing the inside architecture of the building. As you flow through both floors of the building, most of the display boxes have information about the artifacts as well as the history of the synagogue and the related events in the area. It seems like each site in the area has a great map which suggests a route to take through the area - this was helpful when we got to this part of town and were wondering where to start."

It's the very informative exhibits on the balcony that grabbed my attention on a wide variety of subjects, including Terezin (the concentration camp north of Prague). The Spanish Synagogue also sponsors regular classic music concerts, which would provide another way to experience it.

Despite not much of the original Jewish Quarter surviving, the synagogues are a great look back to how this area of Prague was before its reconstruction. Some may feel that the synagogues were lucky to survive Prague's Nazi occupation, but the truth of the matter is much more sinister. It was Hitler's intention to keep the Jewish Museum intact, so that in later years, when the Jews had been eradicated, if anyone ever questioned whether it had all happened, he would have it as a 'museum of an extinct race'. Knowing this gave me a much deeper understanding and more grave feeling as I explored the different buildings of the museum, knowing that it could have been for a completel different reason."

The Spanish Synagogue, just one part of the amazing sites in the old Jewish Quarter, awesomely demonstrates what was once a thriving Jewish community in the heart of Europe. What remains for us to view and contemplate is what the Nazis thought would be a museum and the subsequent communist government was too lazy to completely destroy. The small Prague Jewish community continues to restore this and other important sites so the public can view them. The attached photo of the Spanish Synagogue\u2019s interior is opulent. Not so the Old New Synagogue that is also part of the quarter. Dating from Medieval times, it recalls the ancient architecture and long history. It is still in use and congregants meet for prayers every week. The Old Jewish cemetery, with bodies supposedly buried 12 or more deep, includes the remains of sages and scholars, doctors and lawyers, and those who resided here over the centuries. Just walking through it evokes images of our ancestors. Along with the multiple artifacts that have been preserved that once functioned in European Jewry\u2019s daily home life, possibly the most disturbing exhibit described how the post-WWII Czech government treated (and treats?) Jews. Not a pretty picture. Reasons for seeing this site are many. For Jews and those of Jewish heritage, it recalls our ancestors. For others, it is a view of how those in the community lived when the Prague Castle was even more important than it is today. It also implicitly poses the question: Can you imagine the wondrous synagogues and artifacts that didn\u2019t survive because they were intentionally destroyed?"

All competently executed, and with a smiling stage presence, in a ornately decorated synagogue setting with decent if unspectacular acoustics. There was no Dvorak or Smetana, surprisingly. The synagogue exhibits = glass cases along the wall, old prayer books, illustrations of famed rabbis, Torah covers, head shots of Prague Jewish intellectuals, etc. The accompanying descriptions of pre-Nazi Jewish life were a bit dry but tasteful enough.

The exhibition provides a moving, heart-breaking journey through the life of Czech Jewish community from the every day life in Prague to the famous artists and writers. Its just the right length and packs a lot of information into such as small exhibition."

The building is so beautifully decorated in Moorish style, with so much to see and admire, from the painted walls, arches and ceilings to the windows and lights. In addition there is a really interesting exhibition, which can be found on the ground floor and on the first floor, around the galleried area, dedicated to the history of the Jews in Bohemia and Moravia from emancipation to the present. The exhibition in the gallery is about the Jews in the Czechoslovak Republic between the two World Wars. It provides a good insight into how it was for Jews living there during those years and a good basis for our future visit to the Terezin concentration camp (outside Prague)."

If you are short on time, this one building has a lot. Great building with Moorish revival mid-19th century decoration. Very fantastical with gilding and moorish designs and brightly colored wallpaper. There is an exhibition about Jews in Prague from medieval times to the present and the experience during WWII. There are photos and letters and small objects and drawings from the children etc. Don't miss the exhibit upstairs of the silver and treasures gathered from all of the synagogues by the Nazis. Fortunately it was not melted and it has remained as one group on display. Great shop as well with books and historical information as well as gifts etc."

The Spanish Synagogue has a very interesting exhibition on the life of the Jewish population \u2013 for years during the WW2, it served as a storage room for many items from the entire country. Now, some of these items are displayed there. If you are interested in the Jewish history of Prague and what is now Czech Republic, I suggest you buy the ticket that covers all the Jewish attractions in the Old Town. Start with the Spanish Synagogue and head to Pinkas where you can get an audio guide. The Spanish Synagogue is a masterpiece and I am positive you will be mesmerized with its interior. Pictures are not allowed (???) but can you blame myself for breaking the rules? It is such a beautiful place and I wanted to take some memories with me. Wanted to attend a concert there but time did not allow. Next time."

I visited all of the synagogues in the Jewish Quarter and would recommend buying the ticket which allows admittance to all of the synagogues as the history and the difference between them is something very special. One recommendation and one warning though! Recommendation:Classical music concerts are held each night at the Spanish Synagogue and the atmosphere is wonderful. The music was beautiful and it was well worth buying a ticket (this cost 700K\u010d). The concert lasted for an hour. Warning: You aren't allowed I take photos in any of the synagogues which can be disappointing especially as they are so beautiful. However, for some reason, if you go to the concert you can take photos so that's one way round it! A spiritually meaningful place with an interesting historical exhibition attached."

The ticket sellers and vendors are devoid of emotion, appearently not Jewish or even caring non Jews, and there is a small street that sells trinkets, made in China junk, and blares loud rap music right outside the synagogue. It seems that the Czechs should do more to honor what to Jews is a very poignant historical place and not let it turn into a purely commercial area. There was no soul or pathos left in the area, and I really resented the unfriendliness of all involved. I had done extensive research into the Prague Jewish quarter, and have to say that out of all the places I visited in German and Poland, Prague's Jewish area is the most crass, commercialized and disrespectul of all the Jewish sites in Central Europe. If you are Jewish and go there, please tell me if you think I am wrong about this."

Seating was mixed, and the style of service was close to U.S.Conservative. There's no \"eruv\" in Prague, but ladies had their purses (I think this used to be the European style of observing Shabbat). The crowd was friendly, and the atmosphere relaxed.We had visited the museum part and had admired the architecture before we attended the service, but if you're Jewish and want to greet some of the Jewish community in Prague, this is one place to go.Like many European synagogues, this one has security agents to quiz visitors who come for services, of course."

The concert was about an hour long and was not cheap (about $35 US per person) but the combination of beautiful music in such dramatic surroundings was a memorable experience. I would reccomend it to travelers who want to experience the musical side of the Golden City.Be aware, however, that there are only about eight wooden benches so space is extremely limited, and the seats are far from luxurious. A few people ended up trying to find chairs to pull up because they were unable to sit on the wooden pews comfortably. I did not find it that uncomfortable, but it is not like sitting in a theatre."
