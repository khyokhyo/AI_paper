Julie at Cape Splendour organised the transfers, hotels, and experiences for our three week holiday in South Africa.The transfers were always on time, the hotels were superb and the experiences will last us a lifetime.We had three fantastic days in Tsukudu Bush Lodge in the Pilansberg Park, a unique and exciting time. The Pretoria to CapeTown Rovos Rail train journey was like stepping back in time. The service and facilities were second to none, attention was paid to every detail.The Wine tram is worth a day out. Good fun and the vineyards are really interesting, the wines good too.Julie took us to Superb vineyards, penguin colonies and drove us through the most spectacular scenery, she even managed to find some whales for us. She has a great knowledge of South African history and makes every journey inform and entertain.Thank you Julie making our stay so much fun and so much more than a holiday."

Julie organised the majority of our 3 week holiday in South Africa for us and our friends.From a wonderful safari to the delights of the waterside in Capetown.From hidden boutique hotels to tastes of absolute luxury. Discovering new wines and the stunning scenery that the Cape has to offer, rugged mountain backdrops, white beaches and turquoise seas. Julie drove us to all of these and showed us more than we would ever have done without her. We set Julie quite a challenge in organising this holiday of a lifetime and she more than exceeded our expectations.If you want to see everything that the Cape has to offer, call Julie, you'll love it"

Julie called us ahead of time to see what kind of wines we were interested in and tailored our trip around our wine tastes. We tasted chocolates and cheeses as well. She also drove by a few sights we had not been able to see while we were touring the previous days. She is delightful to spend time with. You can't go wrong!"

Julie is an amazing human being who encompasses knowledge and caring and interest and humo(u)r and personal experience and stories into her trips. she made us feel like she was just a very good friend taking us around to see everything of note in her town. what a joy!we had the pleasure of having Julie guide us for three full days; one in town, one on the Cape, and one inland in the wine country. her knowledge is expansive; but what really sealed the deal for us was her personal connection to everything. i thought that it was wonderful to be able to talk to someone with decades of local knowledge and experience; someone who really made our trip to Cape Town 'personal.'also of note is her personal tailoring of each trip. she asked, we discussed, and conclusions were made based upon our needs and wants. she really listens!i would wholeheartedly recommend Julie, and in fact i look forward to returning to Cape Town and seeing / touring with her again!"

Very knowledgeable about the geography and history of the region. Very engaged with our children. It was a great start off to our vacation.We also booked a transfer to Aquila Game Preserve with Julie, however she was not able to do this herself. She arranged one of her colleagues Martin to fill in for her. We knew of this well in advance. He was also great with his willingness to share his love of the region with us. We were quite fortunate to have found Cape Splendour Tours and would happily recommend."

She was very responsive and we had several discussions about what wineries to hit and what would make for the best itinerary. She was flexible and willing to pick us up at Kirstenbosch gardens instead of at our hotel, and was on time and waiting for us for our scheduled departure. The vehicle was clean and had ample room for our group (3 adults and 2 children). All of the wineries were great, but the best winery of the day was one of her suggestions - great wine, great views, and a huge lawn area where the kids played soccer and croquet. Our only regret was that we did not have more than a day to spend there."

After a helpful discussion with Julie we decided on an itinerary at the start of the day and off we went. We had prebooked lunch at Delaire Graf so Julie made sure our route got us there for the lunch just in time. At the end of the tour we all agreed that Julie had really added value to the experience - throughout the tour she was happy to chat to us not only about the vineyards but about life in South Africa in general. She was the perfect guide for the day, full of interesting stories and background info on the places we visited - we could have listened to her all day. No hesitation in recommending her for any tour and feel a bit guilty about leaving it so long before finally getting round to writing the review (sorry Julie !!)."

Julie is an excellent guide, knowledgeable, gave us all the information we could need and was very good company. Her vehicle is very comfortable and she is an very safe and confident driver.Nothing was too much trouble, she reacted to any changes we wanted to make on route and gave brilliant recommendations for the itinerary both before we went in the planning stage and en route.Her day to day planning was excellent, a whale viewing was timed to perfection, she even managed to stop the few rain showers we had just as we wanted to get out of the car. The accommodation selected was very comfortable and in the case of the Elephant Hide spectacular in every respect especially the view.We enjoyed the tour so much we asked if Julie could extend it to take us on the Cape peninsular tour which she managed to accommodate by moving other things she had planned to do and picked the best day for weather.All in all a great trip which made our South African adventure a holiday we will treasure for ever made so by Julies expertise.If you are going to SA and want a guide you will do no better."

Julie went the extra mile by taking us \"Jo'burg\" travel agents to all the local areas for shopping, eating and stopping in places where we had great background photos. Julie takes pride in her own business. Julie is extremely knowledgeable about the different areas of the Cape, such as the History of the Cape, where to stay, where to eat and which vineyards are great for wine tasting lovers.

We has previously used Julie from Cape Splendour a couple of years ago for a very successful family holiday tour of the Cape Town and beautiful surrounding area but this was a solo visit with a business twist. I was looking for suppliers for a new business importing wine to Singapore. I contacted Julie to see if she could arrange a few meetings with prospective suppliers meeting my criterion. Julie was on the case and we exchanged emails finalising the details but I pretty much left things in her hands - and she came up trumps. She collected me from my hotel at the V&A and we headed off on a bespoke mini wine tour which included a spectacular 'boutique, estate in the Helderberg area. We took a break from the sourcing and tasting with a lovely Al fresco lunch in beautiful surroundings. Three of the four people we visited are now on my suppliers list and the other wasn't bad but just didn't quite offer what I was looking for. After a full and very successful day Julie dropped me back at my hotel, job well done. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommend Julie for any touring activities you are planning as there is no doubt that she well come as close as possible to putting together the perfect package for your visit. I will certainly use her again and am already planning my next visit for next year."

Due to unforseen circumstances, Julie was unable to meet us for our first day of Cape Town tourning to the Wine Lands. However, she called us upon our arrival to our hotel to apologize and assure us she was sending someone in her place as not to upset our planned day. After our first day which was a lovely day spent wine tasting, we were with Julie for the next 2 full days. She was easy to work with, and tailored our day to what we wanted to see and do while in Cape Town. She is knowledgable and energetic about sharing Cape Town and it's history. My husband was highly interested in seeing the whales in Hermanus and we had arranged for a whale watching trip. However, when Julie came to our hotel that morning, she informed us that because of the winds, the whale watching boats were not going out that day. But that we would still make our way to Hermanus where we could walk the cliffs and hopefully see the whales. Unfortunately, the whales that afternoon did not want to make themselves visiable, and after lunch we were going to start making our way back to Cape Town from Hermanus. Julie found a small beach/cliff watch and within mere seconds of being there, we were able to see a number of whales right off the coast line. My husband was THRILLED!!! We would highly recommend calling Julie to help make a memorable stay in Cape Town, and would definately call her again should our travels find us back in South Africa."

            "review": "Love Julie's Professionalism!. Our great service started well before we arrived in Cape Town. My dad worked with Julie over 6 months prior to our arrival. Of all the potential tour guides he contacted, she was the most professional and organized. She was able to handle ALL the activities we wanted, and work it into a manageable schedule for our 5 days in Cape Town. She even added suggestions that we might want to incorporate. She then provided us with a detailed itinerary to review. Our family greatly enjoyed 3 of our 5 days in Cape Town with Julie. Our Cape tour was already booked with another company prior to contacting her, and we toured the Langa Township with a company who specializes in Township tours.Julie picked us up at the airport in her immaculate van and hurried us to our bed & breakfast to drop off our luggage for safety. Then we were off to Table Mountain. Visiting Table Mountain was high on our to-do list, but during the winter, getting up there can be a problem with the unpredictable weather. Julie had incorporated flexibility into our schedule to allow us to visit Table Mountain whenever the weather cooperated. But luckily enough, the weather allowed us to visit as soon as we arrived. She accompanied us to the top to point out many interesting facts along the way. Afterwards, she drove around town to find us an open restaurant (not easy on a Sunday!) where we could enjoy a nice meal before retiring for the night. Now that we had crossed Table Mountain off our list, Julie provided us with a revised itinerary for our 2 remaining days. It was nice that she kept everything up to date. Julie would arrive a bit early to pick us up. We never had to worry about her being on time. This day my brother was feeling a little uneasy, but decided to do the day tour with us. Julie was very good in dealing with him \u2013 bathroom stops, not driving fast on curves, etc.That day, we enjoyed an informative city tour and visit to Bo-Kaap. We visited 2 overlooks including Signal Hill, The Company\u2019s Garden, a stroll downtown (National Library, Parliament, and St. George\u2019s Cathedral) and had free time to roam around Greenmarket Square to shop for scarves. One highlight for me was our lunch at Jonkershuis Restaurant at Groot Constantia. Julie introduced us to delicious Cape Malay food! It was one of the best meals on our whole trip. It was nice that she was able to eat with us during our meals also. I do believe they have a policy in South Africa that tour guides meals\u2019 free. That was a nice perk, but we would have been more than happy to pick up her meal too. In the afternoon, we visited lovely Kirstenbosch Gardens, and strolled through with Julie, to end our day just before the rains started.We spent our last day in Cape Town with Julie as well. We visited the Heart of Cape Town museum bright and early on our private tour. Julie arranged this because a school group had already booked the morning tour. It allowed us to see the museum before the crowds. Julie then took us to Stellenbosch to explore the quaint and gorgeous town. We visited some wineries and did some shopping. She suggested we go to her favorite winery, Annandale, which was great. My mom enjoyed the wine tasting and bought some to take home. We then went to a larger winery, Middelvlei. We were not there to wine taste but to enjoy their fantastic boerebraai (barbeque). Afterwards, it was time to head to the airport for our flight home.Julie was full of great insight and made each day special! You can count on her to show you the very best of Cape Town. Let her plan your next visit to Cape Town, and you won\u2019t be disappointed."

Her calm and friendly manner is a pleasant counterpoint to the hectic traffic and bustle of Capetown. Our family just finished a four day tour with Julie and had a fantastic time. She personally picked us up at the airport and took us on a City tour and day trips to the Wine Country, the Cape Peninsula and Gansbaai for a shark dive. All excursions were wonderful and relaxing.Do yourself a favor and book with Julie. You will not regret it. We are experienced travelers who rarely take tours but Capetown can be challenging for first time visitors and touring with Cape Splendour Day Tours is highly recommended. You can't beat local knowledge..."

My husband and I extended our Safari adventure with three days in Cape Town. Not wanting to drive on the left side of the road, we engaged Julie from Cape Splendour Day Tours to navigate us around. We could not have been luckier. Julie is very knowledgeable about the area. She makes suggestions where to go, but will go where you want to go and is the THE most flexible person. We initially asked for her services on a Tuesday and a Thursday. When the weather was not allowing the planned trip to Table Top Mountain on Tuesday, she was willing to add it to the agenda on Thursday. When the weather forecast was not favorable for Thursday but great for Wednesday, she gave up her own plans to switch days for us. Wednesday was a most fabulous and memorable day. We could never have done and seen what we saw on our own. Julie, thanks again. In our book you are #1."

The first day she picked us up from our hotel and we took a very scenic drive to the cape peninsula. We made a couple stops along the way to take in the views and then ate lunch/explored near the Cape of Good Hope before continuing on our journey back to Cape Town. The views were unbeatable. Day two was a trip to do some wine tasting. Julie picked out a number of vineyards based on the types of wine we told her we would like to try. They were all great, but our favorite by far was Annandale. Julie said this was one of her favorite vineyards, and I see why. It was fabulous wine in a fabulous setting. Julie really knows her stuff and she made our trip easy and enjoyable. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a knowledgeable driver while on your stay in Cape Town."

What were the \"must see \" things? I didn't want to go so far, and then not get to see all the important attractions.I decided to stay in Cape Town for a week, then move on having rented a hire car. As I searched through the Internet, I came across Cape Splendour tours. Not really being one for organised tours, I noticed that they not only did tours but prepared itineraries for people who wanted to self drive. I checked TripAdvisor for Cape Splendour and its founder, Julie Clarke.I thought I would give them a try.Julie spent a lot of time preparing an itinerary based on what we liked and did not like. A rough guide of our ages, capabilities and requirements, and she came up with an agenda of what to see, where. and who to stay with. Once it had been bounced backwards and forwards a few times, we had the final plan.I then needed to give her my credit card details so she could book the accommodation. As an ex Police Officer, I must admit to being a little wary about this. I had no reason to be whatsoever. Wherever she had booked us in, we had marvellous b and b accommodation in some stunning places, with amazing views. Exactly what I had asked for.We did use Julie for one day tour. This was to the Cheetah Outreach program near Cape Town, including Stellenbosch and 5 vineyards for wine tasting. A truly remarkable day, especially tailored to what we wanted to see and do.She is a lovely lady, who is easy to get on with. It was a pleasure spending the day with her. She is honest and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her services."

We were lucky enough to have Julie and her company Cape Splendour Tours recommended to us and lucky also that Julie was available. Julie took us on a Winelands tour for the day. The highlight was without doubt the vineyard with the unpronouncible name which had a stable of runner ducks who act as pest control around the vines and eat all the snails and insects. This was a real treat to see including the breeding process and was topped off by being offered a wine tasting, which was named Runner Duck. We had a wonderful day. The next day, Julie handed us over to Martin as she was unavailable, Martin was an equally good guide who took us to Cape Point. His maritime knowledge was fascinating and he ensured that again we had a wonderful day of touring. Thank you both Julie and Martin for your high level of professionalism which ensured we had a two jam-packed interesting days. If you know you are going to CT, book early for Cape Splendour Tours as I think we were lucky to get in on short notice. Jill, Perth. Australia"

Seeing those splendid creatures added the WOW factor to our holiday! Julie\u2019s knowledge of the areas we travelled was amazing and we learned so much on those trips. She also knew the ideal vantage points to take photos and so we\u2019ve managed to bring home with us many photos that will bring back very happy memories of a wonderful holiday.

Julie came to us highly recommended, and she did not disappoint. All communications pre - trip were handled over email, and our visit in May was flawless. Julie's fantastic knowledge of the area and wonderful sense of humor kept us entertained on our Cape Peninsular tour, and our private tour was full of memorable moments with breathtaking views from Chapman's Peak and the lighthouse, baboon sightings and the penguins, of course.The entire group had a great time, and all are coming home with beautiful pictures and memories. Several of us are planning repeat visits when back in town. I highly recommend Julie Clarke and Cape Splendour Day Tours!"

We found Julie and Cape Splendour Tours after hearing a story on the radio in Pennsylvania (USA) about Pack for a Purpose...a great organization that connects travelers with organizations all over the world that need a little help obtaining needed supplies to complete their missions. Julie works in partnership with Pack for a Purpose to support Rainbow of Hope orphanage in Cape Town and we were happy to be able, when we met up with her for our first tour, give her supplies to take to the 12 children who call Rainbow of Hope home. It was easy and affordable, by the way, to buy the supplies at the local grocery store when we got to Cape Town, rather than hauling them across the ocean! We prebooked a day safari trip with Cape Splendour at the Aquila Game reserve. Our whole trip to South Africa was a little \"out of the comfort zone\" of some of our family members and this seemed a good way to venture out of the immediate Cape Town area and have a \"big game\" experience without venturing all the way up north to the big game parks. We were not disappointed. Julie is on time, responsive, family-friendly, flexible, knowledgeable, and just plain enjoyable to be around. We enjoyed discussions on many topics that helped us understand the complex history and cultures of South Africa. We enjoyed the day so much that we booked another day trip...this one a Peninsula tour...that was just as wonderful as the first. Julie has a unique mix of professionalism and friendliness that serve her well as a guide and her guests well as she makes them feel comfortable and \"at home\"...even halfway around the world!"

She was always quick to respond to my emails with changes. While sightseeing, Julie's historical acumen of the city is amazing. She shuttled us around to all the sights in her lovely new van. She was excellent with the kids, often quizzing them on what they had seen. Loved that! She expertly set up all our transfers to the city and wine country which was a huge stress relief.

            "review": "Great Day Tour. Let's start at the beginning with the big question - If I were going back to Cape Town would I use Julie's services again - Absolutely without any question.We arranged two services with Julie - pick up from the Cape Town airport, and a day tour of the Cape. After flying 20+ hours Julie was at the airport, found us, and got us on our way to our hotel. On the drive from the airport to the hotel we got a mini tour including the history of District 6 and restaurant recommendations and she gave us some ideas of how to spend a day walking around Cape Town on our own. What was important to me was that she was at the airport waiting for us with a sign. We also had extensive communication through email and I had sent Julie a picture of my wife and myself and she found us before we spotted her sign with our names.On the day of our Cape tour she arrived at the hotel on time, spent time with us to understand what we were and were not interested in and got us on our way. From my perspective Julie is customer centric and worked with us to make our day on the cape work. The Cape sites speak for themselves, but Julie gave us a lot of insight into what was going on, how things got to be the way they where, and in her vehicle she had a number of field guides for animals and birds as well as being able to answer all of the questions we asked. We had plenty of time to make impromptu stops to look for animals, see antelope, and baboon at the Cape as well as a stop at Boulders for penguins. Julie gave us great advice at the Cape about the Funicular versus walking to the light house, and lots of back story on the history of the lighthouse. On the way back into Cape Town we also stopped at the Rhodes Memorial and Julie filled in many of the gaps in our knowledge of Cecil Rhodes, and shared a local legend regarding the lions at the monument. Julie was quite easy to work with. We made arrangements using email a single phone call. Let me end with where I started - if I'm ever in Cape Town and need a private tour guide - I would not hesitate to use Julie's services again, In fact I would start with Julie and if she wasn't available I'd ask her for a recommendation as to whom I should use. What I find surprising is that Julie and Cape Splendour are not more highly ranked on trip advisor."

We had 6 nights at 2 private games reserves (Tanda Tula in Timbavarti and Lukimbi in the Southern Kruger) and then 5 days in Cape Town before returning to the UK. We had been to South Africa before and knew the areas that we wanted to revisit but also wanted to travel to other places. We booked Julie via the internet and, through her, we also booked Craig Barrowman since Julie was not available for all the time that we wanted to tour.What we received was exactly what we had hoped for - 3 days of extreme in-depth conversations about almost every aspect of South African life, social history, politics, economics and wildlife whilst being ferried around the countryside. Although both Julie and Craig have favoured itineraries, they were more than happy to modify these. For example, we diverted to the Paarl sewage works which is a well know bird watching site! Both guides had comfortable vehicles with a PA system and the absence of other travellers meant that we could stop when ever we wanted, stay as long as we wanted and skip whatever we wanted. There is no doubt that we would have seen a small fraction of what we did see had we undertaken a self drive tour and we would have missed so much of the background explanations.If and when we return to South Africa, Julie and Craig will be our first point of call for value for money, background knowledge and a pleasure to be with."

Julie responded to my email promptly and suggested a three day itinerary and practical advice on booking Table Mountain and Robben Island tickets online in advance so as to avoid disappointment and long queues.We arrived late in Cape Town because of 3 hour delay in BA flight leaving Heathrow. Julie was waiting for us in Cape Grace Hotel and she quickly reorganised our itinerary. The following there was a very long queue at Table Mountain and according to Julie we would have to wait for atleast three hours to get to Table Mountain. We therefore headed for Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope in perfect weather visiting the penguins at Boulders and Simontown on our way. We had an excellent lunch at Cape Point that was prebooked on Julie's advice.

Julie knew the times of departures of tours and boat trips , where the best views were and always a story about the area when we were travelling.

Julie's company and expertise were wonderful. She then took us to the penguin preserve, which couldn't have been more delightful. Julie mentioned that not many people seem to know about this place, and while we were not alone, we didn't have to fight any crowds.

We did the Garden Tour togehter.We have been to Stellenbosch and did an interesting Cellar Tour for some wine tasting. It was really excellent. After that we have been to Oudtshoorn to an Ostrich Farm and to the Cango Caves and to the Wildlife animal park. Really brillant was also our stay at Knysna Waterfront. We did the Fetherbay trip - a boot took us across the lagoon and we were taken up on a hill with a special kind of \"truck\" - really funny and intersting. On our way down to the beach we had an amazing view and shot some very good photos.Very nice and impressive was also the Knysna Elephant Park, where we had the chance to feed and stroke the Elephants. We have also been to Plettenberg beach and took a boat ride to see a lot of Seals and - very impressive - also a Whale. Thanks to Julie and her perfect organization - also choosing excelllent Guest Houses - we will never forget such impressive and very nice holidays. Julie guided us perfectly. Thank you so much, Julie.Best regards from Regine and Wolfgang from Germany."

We just returned from our first trip to Africa. six days in the bush followed by 3 glorious days in Cape Town where we had the pleasure of being shepherded around by julie clarke of Cape Splendour Tours. Not only did julie put up with our rigorous schedule, but her intimate and in depth knowledge of Cape Town and South Africa made this time absolutely wonderful.Our whole experience wiht Cape Splendour, and Julie clark in particular made the trip! We spent one whole day touring the wine region in Stellenbosch and Constantia. She showed us some great wineries, treated us to some premiere tastings, and drove around two inebriated tourists with great cheer. Lunch at Delaire and the gardens at Babylonstoren were unforgettable! We spent a whole other day driving the penninsula== something a vistior to Cape Town should not miss. Probably one of the most spectacular days ever! We visited an Ostrich farm, the penguin preserve, some more wineries, and even had a major baboon encounter on the way. Anyone planning a trip to Cape Town should absolutely ahve a guide,a nd I for one, cannot think of anyonewho could possibly be better. Her prices were more than reasonable for our whole-day excursions. She even picked us up and dropped us off at the airport which reduces the stress level in a huge way!We felt as if she were one of the family by the end and have vowed to return soon. Only next time, she will arrange the whole shebang!"

In planning the trip I had looked extensively for a local tour guide who would be able to put together the perfect tour for us, I was lucky to find Julie in my search. Right from the start she made planning the trip easy with lots of helpful suggestions and ideas of places to visit! When we arrived it was so good to have her meeting us at the airport and not having to worry about getting to our guesthouse. Julie had organised the most beautiful accommodation for our trip, I especially loved The Thorntree in Oudtshoorn. We loved the week we spent in the Cape and Julie was extremely organised, prompt, very knowledgeable and easy to talk too. Our conversations on the road were never boring! I would recommend Cape Splendour to anyone wanting a professional and friendly tour of South Africa. It was amazing!"

We hired guides in countries we visited in the past, so we decided we would hire a local guide to show us Capetown. We received a referral from a colleague who used Cape Splendour. We had the best time. The owner, Julie Clarke, planned our itinerary based on our schedule & our interests. Julie was prompt, organized and knowledgable. It was like traveling with a friend.

In exchanging emails with Julie Clarke over a couple of months prior to our visit to the Cape Peninsula, I was gratified to see how quickly she understood the type of tour we were looking for. Touring Cape Town and environs in just one day is a pretty demanding challenge. Julie came up with some new ideas and pre-booked several attractions that I would not have thought of, even though I have been to the Cape many times before. While touring, Julie wears a hands-free speaker phone so that everyone in the vehicle can hear her narrative. The Seal Island book trip from Hout Bay was really enjoyable and the hour we spent at the Scratch Patch in Fish Hoek was well worth it, not only for our 12 years-old granddaughter but for all of the adults as well! Lunch at the Jonkershuis was outstanding. Due to limited mobility of some of our party, Julie arranged a golf cart tour of Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens and our guide was excellent! We topped off the day with a ride up Signal Hill through Bo Kaap. I highly recommend Cape Splendour Tours for anyone looking for a friendly, knowledgeable, guide, and a tour organized to fit your specific needs."

I thought since I was going to be in South Africa I should take some time there and see some of the country. Not really knwing where to start I searched on the internet and came across Julie and Cape Splendour Tours. This was one of the best decisions I made! Not knowing Julie at all at the time I was worried that I sending my money off to a black hole; but I thought I hope this works out. Sure enough on my arrival in Cape Town Julie was there to meet me. First day, a tour of Cape Town, a review of our plans, and then off to my Bed and Breakfast. Julie told me it was just a little place in the subuarbs of Cape Town. It was wonderful, (I remeber saying at the time it was too nice for me) All of the places I stayed while Julie took me on a tour of the Garden Route of South Africa were absolutely fantastic. One of the most amazing aspects of my tour with Julie, was that we had never met before this trip started; but within a few days its was like we were two old friends that had met again, and whe were happily travelling together and renewing a long lost friendship.Even the time we had the pleasure of changing a flat tyre on the side of motorway was a good part of my tour. I think that I discovered a gold mine when I found Julie Clarke and Cape Splendour Tours on the internet. I want to thank Julie was making my time in South Africa so very special. I feel that we parted as friends and I am happy to say we are still in touch 4 years later.If you want to have an unforgettable tour of Cape Town and area you have to look no further than Julie Clarke and Cape Splendour Tours.Thank you."

She has information on everything - hotels/hostels to stay, wineries, garden route and even has useful connections further afield, such as Johannesburg. She's also very flexible and even creative, if your holiday plan suddenly changes and you have to make alternative arrangements. I would strongly recommend starting your Cape Town trip plan by talking to her."

Despite my habit of visiting old places again (always the best of course) Julie balanced this with the needs of the rest of the party ensuring that everyone had a good holiday. We had a mixture of Cape Town, (The Sir David was great), Bartholomeus Klip (still like home), spectacular stay in Swellendam and Mossel Bay (Susan's B&B is fantastic and our granddaughter loved it and the extra care from Susan) and a game reserve (the giraffe were very photogenic). In all, thank you to Julie for looking after us so well, doing it in a very friendly way, being efficient and getting everything right and for a great holiday. And oh, I nearly forgot, I did the Cape Argus Cycle Tour in 5 hours and 25 minutes - not bad for an old guy.Thank you for a great holiday."

On our first visit to Cape Town, we had the pleasure of making a new friend based on an old friend's recommendation. Julie Clarke runs Cape Splendour tours and we hired her to take us to the Cape of Good Hope. As it happens, we had also booked a tour of the winelands through our hotel on the previous day so we had a point of comparison. The winelands tour was perfectly fine; the guide was friendly but didn't know much about wine since he didn't drink. He was clearly following a set itinerary. He also cost about 30% more than Julie for the same amount of time -- 9:00 am to 6:00 pm. Julie, on the other hand, started by asking what we were interested in and then saw to it that we experienced it all. She is very personable, a fount of knowledge about the areas we visited, very flexible with the schedule, and a lot of fun. We highly recommend her services."

Everything was a little 'short-notice', as we had had to cancel a visit to St.Helena, and put together four weeks in South Africa instead. We were always going to stay in Cape Town for a week though, and we spotted Cape Splendour Tours on our internet searches. Julie was an excellent, knowledgeable guide, and a fine companion also, for our two separate trips. We did a 'round-trip' beginning at our base just north of the city at Blouberg, via Cape Town, then the north-west coast, cutting across towards the Cape. It was all new to us, but we completed a very full day, returned to our base, armed with a much clearer picture about alot of things, and an SD card full of great snaps. Our other day's excursion with Julie was to the Winelands, and it was very much a bespoke tour; as much or little wine as we wished to sample, with information a-plenty about Stellenbosch and Franschoek, which we visited by request for our own reasons. Julie also has in-depth knowledge of good eating places, and quite a few contacts. We have no hesitation in recommending Cape Splendour, and Julie's excellent personal touch. In fact we were already in communication with her for trips out and hotel bookings also, for another trip down that way this year, before having to cancel; so we'd like to think that we will go through the same 'channel', if we are able to re-book!"

She picked us up at Ruslamere and was prompt, fun to be with and so knowledgeable about the Cape and all it's history. We toured the coastline, stopping to take photos and see some breathtaking vistas. First day to the Cape of Good Hope and a great lunch, then the penquins. She identified all the flowers and fauna, we spotted ostrich and had to be careful of the baboons! The second day was a winery tour and the cheetah rescue. Another great lunch and meeting the gal who is the winemaker, the owner of the place and the gal who is head chef topped off another great day. She was accomodating to our friends on the tour who needed to make a stop along the way and her van was immaculate, comfortable and a smooth ride all the way, all over some roads that were single lane, winding and had lots of curves. Go to Cape Town, but secure tours with Julie first. She made it even more memorable because of her knowledge of the Cape's history, the big ships, the early settlers, the new growth. Enjoy !!!"

The Cape of Good Hope is more than the fresh wind that blows in your skin but a remembrance that because of what happened in the History it wasn't a waste that the place was created. Freddie wasn't just driving but joining us in our laughs, he even sang with us \"Welcome to Capetown\" with enthusiastic. Mike in his most patient attitude despite we always came back in the bus late would still remind us with consideration. Baz Bus is one of a kind. What they offer is worth the price.

The food was tasty , and there was plenty of it.I also liked the option of being able to ride bicycles for a stretch of the trip.Baz Bus markets itself as a backpacker experience, but there were visitors of all ages, and the experience was first-rate. I would recommend it to anyone, and another plus is that it's cheaper than other doors.Thanks, Mike for a great afternoon."

Imagine my horror when I realised that I'd left my bum bag on the bus with my passport, driving licence and camera. In actual fact there was no need to worry. Calls to Faith confirmed that my bag had been found intact and arrangements were made for me to be reunited with the bag when I got back on the bus a couple of days later. True to their word their driver Jesse gave me my bag as promised. If you are wondering how safe is it getting on a bus with strangers run by a company that you know very little about put your fears aside, you can trust the Baz Bus to go the extra mile to deliver a professional caring service."

Lunch and snacks were provided. We saw baboons and ostriches too. Mike was very knowledgeable about the area and everything we saw and Freddie was full of jokes. A great time was had by all!"

Thank you Baz bus for a pleasant trip.The driver was punctual and polite and we felt safe and secure travelling on your bus from Durban to Umtentweni.Our observation however is the pick up and drop off times.Arriving and leaving lodges late should be reviewed i.e. checkout time is between 10 and 10.30am and your bus arrives in the evening only.Arrival after dinner can be a problem as some places are far removed from commercial centres.We will always recommend Baz Bus as a safe and pleasant way to get around SA."

Really nice and joyful driver and guide, we were able to observe the seals at Hout Bay, we stopped for a snack and had a wonderful view on the whole bay, then we continued and visited the cute penguins at Boulder's beach. Then we visited the cape of good hope and Cape Point sites. the small cycling trip was very pleasant even though we weren't enough lucky to see wild animals. The view from Cape Point is absolutely breathtaking, and the baboons, despite the warnings against them, were adorable and we were able to approach them really closely. We also observed a ostrich family from close. Thank you Baz Bus for this day, the food was really good. I totally recommend it for any age, any type of group."

But the price was not at all cheap, so my exceptions were higher than this type of transport--- a really narrow seat (& I am a tiny woman), no heat, no armrests & very crowded.

You start out getting picked up at your hostel if it's a Baz Bus stop and make your way South to Hout Bay harbour, where you get to go on a boat cruise for 80 extra rand ($8 CAD). I thought it was well worth it - I was short on time and didn't have another chance to hit the water, and despite it being rainy out it was gorgeous. The other attractions, including the lookout point (breathtaking), penguins (hilarious), and 5km bike ride down to Cape Point (beyond words!) were all so well worth it. Lunch was also included and the tour guide, Vaughn, was really informative and funny. Definitely learned a lot more and caught many highlights that I wouldn't have found on my own! Well worth the price, especially since the transportation up and down the peninsula (about 1.5-2 hours one way) is included!The ONLY qualm I had was that they forgot to pick me up from my hostel despite me calling in, so I almost missed the boat cruise, but I paid for a taxi to catch the bus at the harbour and they reimbursed me later. Doesn't seem like it happens too often - in fact I had the feeling I was the first person this had ever happened to - but it would be a good idea to send an email with your preferred day of touring as well as calling the number they provide, just to cover your bases.10/10 would recommend!"

Reserving the Peninsular Tour was super easy and just a quick phone call. Nceba was a great, informative, approachable tour guide who answered our questions and kept the energy going when our group got quiet. The crowd is mixed from young backpackers to well traveled seniors from all over the world so it was fun. They pick you up at your hostel/hotel (or a designated spot) and also drop you off there. The scenery was beautiful and Capetown really captured my heart. You see penguins, ride past seals on a boat, have a meal in a nice visitor center, hiked up to a lighthouse, take stops for snacks and photos, and even get to ride a bike through a bit of the Cape. I was a bit nervous about getting on a bike but they made sure that I had one that fit my small frame which I appreciated. My only wish was to spend more time at Cape Point but wouldn't ask for anything less. Well organized, I highly recommend."

It does bring you to the places you want to see, however, you need to be the kind of person who does want to be forced to change seats all the time to meet other people and that kind of ''animation''. There is a extremly short cycling part, which takes about 5minutes if you dont slow down on purpose compared to the 30minutes it takes to give everybody his bike. For us, it was quite a tough day, as we did not share the same humour as our guide at all and there was way more ''jokes'' than actual information."

Our driver Freddie was great (and completely mental) and the guide Mike also very good. You start by driving to the harbour and doing the optional seal island exertion for 80 rand to see the hundreds of seals. Basically everyone does this unless you get sea sick as otherwise you just sit in a coffee shop for 40 minutes. You get about 20 meters from the seals so it is a good view!A breakfast stop is included at some point here with juice, muffins and yogurts provided. Simons town and boulders was next with the Penguins. These are great and very cute!Leading to lunch you do a 5-6km bike ride. This was nice enough but a slightly forced addition as you basically get off the bus and then cycle along the same road. The views are nice but the same as you would have from the bus so I would probably rather just save the 30 minutes from the day. Lunch itself was nice with a good spread and lots of it! Mike is very good at keeping you topped up with food :-)You then visit a lighthouse and walk up there for amazing views and then visit the cape of good hope to get your photos taken. The drive back goes along the opposite (west) coast and takes in ostrich farms etc, arriving back into CT for 5.30-6.30 ish. All in all a great day and would recommend. Thanks Freddie and Mike."

We really enjoyed this full-day tour, where we visited the unbelievably cute penguins at Boulder's Beach, drove with bikes through the Cape Point National Park, had a really nice lunch, hiked up to the lighthouse at Cape Point and visited the Cape of Good Hope. Our guide Mike and the driver Freddie very both really nice and fun and provided us with lots of interesting information so the car-drive in between the stops never got boring. Highly recommended!"

I did the tour with guide Vaughan who was very competent and told us many interesting things, and driver Freddie, who was responsible for some very good laughs! It's true that one day is not enough for seeing so many attractions but when you are short of time it's really the best option. I enjoyed especially the Boulder beach penguins, the short bike trip and the delicious lunch."

While in South Africa, if you would like to see the best of the Cape Peninsula, I recommend taking the Baz Bus \u201cCape Peninsula Day Tour\u201d. Whether you\u2019re traveling alone or with a group, this tour made for a fun and exciting day with a little bit of exercise. The passenger van provided door to door service at convenient locations for pick-ups and drop offs. The tour guide Mike made you feel at right home as he announced your name and where you were from as you entered the van. The majority of our tour were backpackers from all around the world which made for interesting conversation. Although I was probably the oldest on the van, I had a ball nevertheless. Our tour began in Cape Town and after a beautiful drive along the Atlantic Ocean we stopped at Hout Bay Harbor and then on to Chapman's Peak for a breakfast break. We stopped at Boulders Beach to see the penguins and made our way to the Cape of Good Hope for that famous photo. We got plenty of exercise climbing our way to the lighthouse at the Cape Point and enjoyed a beautiful bike ride. Although the first portion of the ride was slightly uphill, it was worth because at the end was a picnic lunch. If you forgot your camera there was no worry because our guide Mike took several candid and group photos of the day\u2019s adventures emailed them after about week or so. If you want to see the best of the Cape Peninsula and get a little exercise while you\u2019re at it, I recommend taking this Baz Bus tour. Word of advice, if you decided to do this tour be sure to make your reservations well in advance to ensure that you get a bike for the biking segment."

The trip is well-planned with a bike ride before a delicious picnic lunch. This is one of the truly beautiful spots on earth with cliffs, rocks and turquoise water. This is a good value, too. If you rented a car and had to find everything using your phone, you wouldn't have gotten to ride a bike and take the hike over the rocks that Vaughn showed us. Relax and let Baz Bus drive you."

I really wanted to see Kruger but was hesitant to go it alone. Having previously taken the BAZ BUS 1 day Cape Point tour and loved it, I decided to put my faith in BAZ BUS once again. Once again, I was not disappointed.To be sure, the BAZ BUS tour of Kruger is contracted out to a separate tour group - I forget the name - but don't let that stop you. Everything about the experience was amazing. Our group was small, consisting of me and three college-age females (2 from France traveling together, one from Germany traveling alone). By the end of the four days, we were all very friendly with one another despite language differences, and we've remained friends. This is one of my favorite features of BAZ BUS: small groups of international travellers make for a nice experience. The tour itself was perfect. Day 1: a six hour drive from Jo'Burg to Kruger with several stops along the way. Our campsite was just 15 minutes outside of Kruger, and the accommodations were perfect. Sturdy tents with two beds (actual beds) per tent. The campgrounds had 6 showers (3F/3M) and two toilets. There was a campfire area where we ate dinner. Day 2: twelve full hours on Safari in Kruger - beginning at sunrise when the gates open (6am) until sunset when the gates close at 6pm (18:00). Yes - we saw the complete Big 5 and so much more from our 4x4 open vehicle. Then dinner around our campfire back at the campsite. Day 3: another full 12 hour day at Kruger. As we hadn't seen any rhino or lion on our first day, a second day gave us the opportunity to explore other regions, which provided us with a variety of different animals to spot - including rhino and lion! Day 4: return to J'Burg, with a stop at Blyde River Canyon in the morning. The canyon is beautiful and a nice way to cap the trip. Overall an amazing experience. Great guide, great accommodations, great food (I'm vegan and they accommodated me!!!), great price, and now - great friends. While some might notice that the 4 day tour only includes two full days in Kruger, I do believe this is an appropriate amount of time for for the tour. While I could stay in Kruger forever, you will not be disappointed. If you are considering booking this tour, please know that I have zero complaints, and will be booking the 20 day Victoria Falls next July."

I was warned that the tour group was with the 'backpackers' kind of crowd (no offence intended) and true enough we picked up from almost every backpacker hostel in Cape Town, but the resulting group was the usual mix from young to older. I had stayed at a BnB and they booked me this tour (without actually booking me), but Vaughn was kind enough to accept me even if I was not on the list. As such I did not know what to expect. We stopped off for a short boat ride to a seal colony which was optional. Didn't join this and took the time for coffee and meet some of my tour mates. Then it was off to Boulders/False Bay to check out South African penguins. That was cool. I think we had the breakfast (which was included) after...or was it before the penguins? Anyway a few of us really missed hot coffee, as it was the middle of winter in South Africa. Then off for a 5 km bike ride (this was a delightful surprise, and made me wish the mileage was longer). Then a hearty lunch. Still missed my coffee. Then off to the lighthouse which was a climb up, but really nothing to sweat about. The last part was at the Cape of Good Hope for a short visit and photoshoot. We saw a colony of baboons along the way back. I really enjoyed this tour. Vaughn was an excellent organiser, though you have to put up with his lame jokes. Freddie was the driver, but I believe he would earn more money in a comedy club. I highly recommend this tour to everyone wanting to visit the Cape of Good Hope."

The minibus is clean and ok for this daytrip and normally full of young people from all around the world!

The advice was correct, as I simply rode in the bus down the same hill to Cape Point. I really enjoyed my day, and the lunch was unexpectedly generous in both quality and quantity. The Mercedes-Benz bus was quite new and the guide and driver did their jobs well. It was a damp and cold day but we made the best of it. I\u2019d suggest bringing a raincoat along, even if it looks to be a fine day when leaving. There were several trip highlights for me, including visiting the penguins at Boulders Beach and Cape Point, the most southwesterly point of the African continent.

The online agent was always prompt in his replies and offered excellent advice on the specific details of our Cape Peninsula trip. We were picked up on time at the designated pick up point and we were warmly greeted by Mike and our driver Freddie. They drove us from Cape Town to beautiful places like Cape Point, Boulders beach and Cape of Good Hope just to name a few. The tour lasted from 8AM until 5PM and during that time, Mike provided a running commentary on the sights and offered insights into the South African culture. He was entertaining, sociable, and a joy to spend time with. Our entire trip proceeded without a hitch and the excursions were beyond expectations. Well, except for the fact that due to a problem on Mike's camera, we couldn't get all the pictures taken in our trip. Overall service and friendliness couldn\u2019t be beat, not only by this company but also by Mike and Freddie who made us feel special. I have no hesitation in recommending Baz Bus to others and my experience since this was the trip of a lifetime! Thank you guys!"

We did such fun things like a boat ride in Hout Bay, visited the penguins and even got to cycle 5kms in the Cape Point Nature Reserve. Our guide, Mark, has an incredible depth of knowledge about the Cape, along with a wonderful attitude. Our driver, Freddie, got us around the Peninsula safely, and had great enthusiasm and care for all of us. I will definitely do another Baz Bus tour and can highly recommend Mark and Freddie."

            "review": "Memorable outing 5/5 stars. On Sunday 26th June 2016, I decided that I would take a day journey/tour with Baz Bus.I was told that I should meet at the closest stop to where I reside in Green Point. Cape town. That Is The Sunflower Travelers Stop. At exactly the time said the bus arrived. 8.30am we were off to see the Cape peninsular. I was introduced to the other trippers by a very well spoken tour guide called Vaughn. Straight away he made me feel comfortable and at ease with his joking and familiar demeanor.We went along the coast line, past Camps bay and after 20min. arrived at Hout Bay harbor, where we were given the option to take a boat trip to Seal island to view a colony of seals or we could for the next 50 min. walk around the Harbor at the various gift shops, the wharf or the beautiful beach next to the harbor. I chose to take the boat ride as I have never been on any vessel on the open sea. I was been adventurous. After getting a ticket, we were off. I was nervous at first but the sea was calm and I never once felt sea sick. The boat was filled with tourists from all over the world, snapping away at everything with cameras and cell phones. One of the guys that was on our bus asked me if I could take a pic. of him with seal Island in the background. He had a monster camera with a huge lens that he had brought from India. After taking a few pics. With different backgrounds, we struck up a dialogue about his home town and how I would love to go to India. Seal Island was full of seals and luckily the wind was on our side. Apparently it really stinks. We were lucky\u2026. Nothing after bobbing around in the water for 15min. the boat turned round and we were coming back past Sentinel Hill which I told Natean that it resembled one of the huge temples I would love to see in India.After disembarking we all met at the Baz Buss and were off again next destination the spectacular Chapmans Peak Drive. Once again our very articulate and amusing tour guide Vaughn was on a roll telling us about the leopard sculpture on the rock and how it came to be there. The van stopped at the top of Chapmans peak. Group photo session followed by breakfast muffins and a cordial juice mix, I wished then that there was some coffee as it was rather cold.Musical chairs was the order of the day\u2026. Every stop we had to make sure we sat next to someone new. This encouraged us to really get to know the other travelers. Next stop was Boulders Beach. This where Penguins come to see humans with cameras. The penguins enjoy this past time, that they have made this an official breeding colony where the Jackass Penguin have finally started recovering from becoming extinct. A wooden walk way has been erected as to keep the tourists and penguins separate. After viewing this spectacle\u2026 I decided to wait at the penguin caf\u00e9 with a warm cup of coffee for the bus load to collect.The bus driver was also a well liked funny character who spoke in jokingly poems. His name was Eddie. With the combination of Eddie and Vaughn we were having a marvelous time. After the bus was loaded, we were on our way to the Cape Point nature reserve to ride bikes. All along the way Vaughn played great South African music in between keeping us informed about the Cape surroundings. We entered the Cape Point Nature Reserve and Vaughn after detailing about safety on the bikes and about it being compulsory to wearing helmets. Those who chose to bicycle it to Buffels conservation center, all said that they were confident that 5km was going to be fine. I suffer from Asthma and took a chance, because I had my pump and after signing an indemnity form thought well it\u2019s on me if anything happens. I am responsible and would take it easy. One the way we encountered Zebra. We all stopped and once again the phones and cameras were out and clicking away. The bus took off to go prepare lunch and we would meet at the given point. I took the lead and sped off on a mostly downhill tarred road. Passing a building on my left but viewing an old building on my right with cannons in front of it. I missed the turning but Eddie saw me and yelled \u201cHey, This way\u201d. I turned round. Luckily I heard him as I would of cycled all the way to the Point Parking lot.Lunch was ready and a few of the group were arriving on to the scene with a disheartening story. Natean, The Indian guy I met on the boat, who asked me to take his picture with his large camera, had fallen while riding his bike and at the same time, trying to take some snapshots of the beautiful cape scenery. Vaughn ran off to go and attend to Nataen instantly. An ambulance was called. Vaughn and Eddie nursed Natean until the ambulance arrived. These guys were amazing. They helped patch up as best as possible, before the pros got in. I was very impressed. They missed lunch. Luckily everyone on the tour was very helpful and the food was help yourself kinda food. Perfect for a picnic outing. After all had eaten. Me and a few others helped to clean up with Vaughn just checking in now and then. We were all packed up and ready to go. The ambulance had arrived and Natean was whisked away.The afternoon went on as planned. We stopped at point. It was very windy. I decided not to go up the path to view Cape Point. In the past, I have done this a few times already. So I casually waited at the restaurant sipping on another hot coffee hoping to catch a glimpse of baboons that menace the patrons, but had no luck. Finally at the Cape of Hope sign, a few baboons and ostriches came to show off. After lots of camera action, we were on our way home.Thank you Vaughn. You really made the day. Your forte as a tour guide is Awe inspiring and to Eddie thanks for driving us safely. I will recommend this excursion and was grateful to find out through Vaughn that Baz bus has a hop on hop off plan operating with stop over\u2019s. On the garden route right up to JHB. Thank you guys for a memorable outing. 5/5 Stars. Guy WalterOwner of Clay addicts School Of Ceramics021 4397686"

            "review": "Luggage stolen directly out of Baz Bus. This year April, I traveled with a friend from Durban to the Northern Drakensberge with the Baz Bus. We have been in South Africa since February and did not encounter any problems till then. The Baz Bus was by far the most expensive transportation, but it also claimed to be the safest and therefore we decided to invest the money. However 10 minutes in the Baz Bus and we regreted that decision dearly. We were still in Durban; in Pinetown to be precise. Not in the best nor safest environment and NOT on the regular route, which the bus should have taken. The bus driver claimed, he simply wanted to drop something from his own personal car off at his mechanic. Unfortunately, the bus driver did NOT lock the trailer with the therefore existing locks (which were with him in the front of the bus by the way). So while we were shortly stuck in traffic, three items of luggage got stolen directly out of the Baz Bus. Not only all clothes, but also IDs, driver's licenses, passports, bankcards etc. were lost. We, the passengers, were then left completely alone stuck in the middle of the more than unsafe surrounding with people observing us and informing us that it is not wise to stay there. After maybe 15 minutes our bus driver finally came back and we drove not first to the police station but instead firstly to his mechanic. This happend in the beginning of April and since then I have been in contact with the Baz Bus, requesting a compensation for all of my stolen goods. As the bus was not on the regular route and the trailer was not locked (as it is supposed to be) the fault lays undeniably with the Baz Bus company. However I have been put off and after handing in an official claim and till now I have gotten nowhere. So my advise would be: not to leave your luggage in the trailer or check if it really is locked. Because receiving any compensation from the insurance is more than difficult. I had nothing but trouble so far, trying to manage everything while being in South Africa - I can tell you: No fun. Not at all. I have lost quite some valuable goods, and am not willing to look it over. So as you can imagine, I am not going to be a fan of the Baz Bus and would not recommend it to my friends. Personally."

We stopped at the Waterfront and enjoyed breakfast and lunch at different places and also had the option to cycle between stops. After arriving at Cape Point we then walked to reach the Cape of Good Hope where the Atlantic and Indian oceans meet and the views were spectacular! We also visited the African Penguin colony on a small but beautiful beach and a lighthouse which was my first time to see one and a highlight of my trip. It was a busy but great day and as a first time visitor to Cape Town, it was a very interesting and informative tour."

Thank you to Mike and Freddy for being outstanding guides and driver.There is one thing that makes this day trip unique compared to the other ones: there is no wifi on the bus and the bus is small (20 persons). As a result, you end up talking with your neighbours and establish great connections with the other travelers. The nature is georgeous. We have seen pinguins, seals and even a whale. What a fantastic trip.Highly recommended, especially if you are travelling on your own."

Mike, the guide was knowledgeable, laid-back and friendly. Freddie was funny! The tour took you in a relaxed manner past some highlights of the Cape (e.g. seal colony (not included, but well worth the money), pinguins at Simon's beach, a short mountainbike ride and of course to Cape the Good Hope. The mountainbikes seemed brand new. Lunch was also included, which was really extensive and healthy. All in all, it was a fun, relaxed day with good value for money!

By the time we had picked up all the other tourists it was about 9:30 am before we left the city limits. We took the optional boat trip at Hout Bay to see the seals, which was worth it. The penguins at Simon's Town were difficult to see with the fencing and hoards of other tourists. We had a much better view of them later in our trip at Betty's Bay. We drove around to Chapman's Peak and here they had us cycle for 5 km. The chains fells off several people's bikes, but everyone coped and seemed to have fun with this. It was nice to get some exercise, even in the heat. The Cape of Good Hope is just beautiful, the views amazing. A wild ostrich ran alongside our van for awhile, and later at an ostrich farm, we saw a band of baboons stealing ostrich feed. Our driver Freddie and guide Mark were both great, having a wonderful sense of humour. They shared lots of information about the area, and really encouraged everyone on the trip to get to know each other and have fun."

First off, let me start by saying I have never had a full-day guided tour before, but you can be assured this trip will be hard to beat for overall value and quality! Our tour was led by our guide, Mike and his \"pilot\", Freddie. Mike was really knowledgeable about the history, flora, and animal species encountered during our Cape Peninsula Tour. We spotted a few animals ranging from baboons, seals, penguins, ostriches among others during our trip. The trip included a light breakfast, consisting of muffins and juice and a banquet (slight exaggeration) served up by Mike, which included Greek salad, lunch meat sandwiches, chips, drinks and fruits. The highlights of the trip were the penguin colony in Simon's Town, the scenic Chapman's Peak route, 5k bike ride just before lunch en route to Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope. I would recommend this tour to anyone, whether solo, with family or friends! At R$690 an unforgettable experience that was well worth the price of admission."

They take you to the nicest places in the south of the Cape Peninsula, starting from Camps Bay, Houts Bay (highlight of the trip, the seals) than Chapmans Peak (breathtaking views), Boulders Beach (where you can see the Penguins), then a quick bike ride trough Cape Point Reserve (we saw baboons and ostriches) and a stop at Cape of Good Hope. My tip: if it is a sunny day, bring A LOT of sunblocker!!!Our guides Mike and Freddy were really nice, helping us with the picninc and the bikes, and also Katie at the office made an effort to make us feel good.Highly recommended, and I hope to be back soon!"

He drove nice and slowly when the views were great but could pick up some speed when there was nothing to see. Chapman's peak drive was absolutely beautiful and it's great to be able to see it without renting a car.The penguins were a highlight.

I opted out of the bike ride as I am very wobbly at 72 years old but did all other activities including the optional boat trip to see the seals. Mike took group photos which he forwarded including some of Eland spotted during the journey and a very entertaining baboon hunting for food treats in the car park at Cape Point.

The driver phones to let you know if bus running early or late although 'early' can be a bit of a problem if the notice is short! Drivers were friendly and helpful too. My only gripe is related to the destinations that require a shuttle from a drop off point - in my case that was most of the places I chose to visit! This can be costly and the exact charge for the shuttle connection is not advertised so makes it difficult to budget for."

For me, the highlight of the whole trip was the visit to Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope....this alone made the trip worthwhile.

From the very beginning Baz Bus were incredibly helpful and always responded to queries promptly.The tour itself was well organised, the food included was excellent and the safari guide we had, had hawk eye. He was an excellent guide and managed to put up with a group of 9 girls! I was lucky enough to see 4 of The Big 5 and have to say it was a once in a lifetime experience, seeing the animals in their natural environment and hearing lions roar when sat under the stars at night is something that is almost impossible to describe. Thoroughly recommend good value for money."

The bus stops at pretty much every hostel, which I do think is a good idea but when it comes to the bigger city's a lot of your time is spent just driving round them going to all the various hostels.I can't get over the fact that none of the buses have air-con, the heat can be ridiculous at times and that's really my only downfall, maybe be an idea to install air-con??"

Our guide Mark and driver Freddie were amazing, very friendly and funny as well as being full of interesting facts. Overall the trip was very good but didn't have enough time at cape point to do the hike right to the edge but could go up to the light house. The downhill bike ride was fun but just a casual road cycle, we were expecting as off road downhill course (I'm not sure why) this wasn't the case.

They had some new bikes which also didn't work good, brakes and shifting were poorly adjusted...and along the cycling route was a lot of traffic. and the unloading an preparation of the bikes took a long time....so guys at Baz Bus, please adjust and maintain the new bikes and replace the helmets and the old ones or skip the cycling part completely and replace it with a (optional) hike form the lighthouse to cape of good hope, than the tour would be really excellent"

What an amazing experience, thanks Mario and Freddy we really enjoy it. From the early morning coffee in your offices, breakfast on the route, cycling with all the hills (hectic specially when you do not know where to stop), steps to the lighthouse and last but not least all the friends we met. Mario thanks for all the laughs."

The tour covered the following: Boulder's Beach (Penguins), Seal Colony, Chapman's Peak, Cape Point, Cape Of Good Hope, as well as scenic drives through Simon's Town, Hout Bay, and Clifton's Bay. If you're an outdoor enthusiast, there's even an (optional) cycling component that is already priced into the tour. On top of that, I enjoyed the insightful -- and often tongue-in-cheek -- commentary from our intrepid guide, Vaughan Olsen.I'd recommend this tour to anyone who has a day to kill in Cape Town without any reservation whatsoever."

You get to experience every significant attraction along the entire journey from the city center, all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope. The stand out highlight of the tour has got to be Vaughan - our phenomenal tour guide, and his partner in crime, Freddie - our tour bus driver.Vaughan was exceptionally knowledgeable about the areas which we traveled through and succeeded in being truly and genuinely funny (a trait which most tour guides only hope to achieve). He made himself very approachable so that everyone on the tour felt they could comfortably ask him questions.Vaughan's excellent knowledge of Cape Town and humor, coupled with the crazy and laugh-out-loud antics of Freddie, the driver led to a wonderful atmosphere throughout the tour, which all of us on the tour thoroughly enjoyed. Both Freddie and Vaughan worked extremely hard throughout the tour to ensure we had the best experience. This included them setting up a wonderful picnic lunch for us inside the Cape Point reserve. I would like to be able to make this review sound a bit more constructive by suggesting ways in which they can make the tour better. But I simply do not think it gets much better than what the Baz Bus provides. They are the cheapest Cape Point tour available in Cape Town and this is almost unbelievable considering the value you get.Overall, a fantastic tour. There simply is no better way to see Cape Point and the Cape Peninsula other than this superbly run tour."

The tour guide, Mark, was quite informative...knows his suject matter well. And both Mark and the driver, Donovan, were friendly, down-to-earth...which made the trip more enjoyable.More locals should do the trip, to learn more about our Mother City!One thing though, the seats on the bus were quite hard and sitting at the back of the vehicle some fumes came wafting along...but other than that, a wonderful time was had by all. It was fun meeting people from all over the world as well.Well done, Baz Bus team!!!"

We booked the day before our intended tour and had no problem securing a spot. The tour departed the office at 7:30 AM and made subsequent stops to various backpacking hostels. Our driver and guide (so sorry I forgot their names) we great. They were funny and knowledgable of the areas we visited. This is probably one of the best ways to see Cape Peninsula area affordably. The transportation, snacks, lunch and entrance fees were included. We also had a 3mi/5k bike ride once on the cape. It was really nice. I'm happy we booked this tour. I would say the Cape Peninsula area and Boulder's Beach shouldn't be missed when visiting Cape Town. Baz Bus also takes photos throughout the day and later posts them on their Facebook page without trying to sell them to you. I truly appreciate one less person trying to sell me something during vacation. Thanks Baz Bus!"

Loved seeing the penguins at Boulders Beach and the smaller fishing towns, like Hout Bay. Mark was a great guide and Freddy was a fantastic driver. The music in the van was cool, too - we've still got \"Welcome to Cape Town\" stuck in our heads!"

Through study and work opportunities I travelled to various countries. I returned to Cape town from South America on New year's day 2015 after being away for almost eight months. Before coming home I realized that I'd seen many countries and yet had not seen much of my country of birth. Eventually I decided to google bus tours to Cape Point. This is how I discovered Bazbus and decided to take a chance. I called their office and was assisted by Faith who patiently shared detailed information regarding the tour, pick up points and surprising me by adding that lunch would be provided. Wooooow, she made the trip sound very exciting and I confirmed my booking immediately. It was hot and cloudless the morning of the tour as I hopped on the train from the Northern suburbs and travelled to Cape town feeling like a tourist. I then took a 10 minute walk from the station to the Bazbus office in Burg street. At the office we were met by our very competent and knowledgeable tour guide Mario and the tour bus driver Freddie. The day ahead was filled with professional commentary about the historical significance of places we passed and stopped at and also great scenery. It was great to learn soooo much about my birth city. I was the only South African amongst tourists from about 10 different countries. It was a great opportunity to make new friends from different parts of the world. Mario and Freddie made sure we all had fun, lots of laughs and lots of pictures as well. The value for money for the tour is incredible. I paid R650 which included all entry fees (for Cape point as ) lunch, a bicycle ride, the pictures sent to all of us after the tour and much much more.A huuuuuge thank you to Mario, Freddie and the rest of the Bazbus team for making this fun trip happen. May God bless all of you.This is by far my proudest South African experience ever!!!!"

It took a long time to go and pick up everyone from many hotels and guesthouses, but once we left Cape Town the rest of the tour was excellent. Part of the delay was caused by Roger, our guide making sure that there was a bike suitable for my 10 year old son. We were very grateful that they went to so much trouble to make sure we were happy. Roger gave a very interesting and informative commentary throughout the trip. We were given a snack after Hout Bay. Taking the optional ferry to see the seals was definitely worthwhile and one of the highlights of the trip. After seeing the penguins on Boulder Beach and riding bikes for about 30 minutes we were given a simple but tasty lunch. Walking around Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope was a nice end to the trip. The views were amazing. I would highly recommend Baz bus."

The bike rides and hikes are all optional which is great but everyone in my group was so enthusiastic that we all took on the extras and had a great time! The guides are really outgoing and knowledgeable and will make you feel comfortable. A lot of the sites we saw would have really difficult to visit without a tour bus or someone knowledgable about the area, parks and entry fees etc.The Baz Bus is definitely the best option for seeing the sights around Cape PointGreat for young & old travellers!

The tour itself was excellent to, we got to see so much more than we would of done by our selves. Some of the highlights feeding the seals at Hout Bay, watching the penguins on boulders beach, and hitting cape point although the `leisurely` bike ride was a bit tougher than expecting.

Though we knew it would take up an entire day, we decided to do the Baz Bus Cape Peninsula tour, and we are glad we did; by far, it was the highlight of our entire week. It is a great value for what you get--- a full day of transportation, lunch, entry into a few locations, etc--- and it is done extremely well. If Roger is your tour guide, you are in luck. This man is a wealth of knowledge... no matter what the bus is passing, he knows something about it, even to the level of knowing the scientific name of a random flower in the field. This knowledge-base, on the nature and history of Cape Town, not only made the ride enjoyable, but gave us so much to think about. Plus, he had visual aids that he passed along; we appreciated the intentionality in everything he did.Even more, Roger cares about his crew. After doing things on our own the previous week, we were ready to sit back and let someone else guide us; my only hesitation was it feeling too touristy. Roger makes it feel more like he's taking a group of friends out to see his favorite places. He would look out for us, telling us the best vantage points for to see the seals, as well as if we needed anything (we changed our plans for drop off and he helped us to work it out.)If you don't get Roger, it's still an amazing tour. In one day, we experienced so much... seals, penguins, breathtaking landscapes, ostriches, biking... and left feeling like, if that had been all we had done in Cape Town, it would've been enough.If you have a day free in Cape Town, and if you want to really experience the Cape, do this tour. Look at the previous reviews... I'm just seeing them on the side now, and am not surprised to find they had the same amazing experience (especially with Roger!)"

We did a boat trip to see the seals, we went to Boulders Beach to see the penguins, we cycled towards Cape Point (nothing too strenuous and also optional, so don't worry) enjoying a picnic lunch on the way. We walked between Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope and viewed some Ostrich's and their babies from the van on the way back. After we got back we were tired but not too tired to take advantage of a clear evening over Table Mountain so we took the Cable car to the top and watched the sunset. Altogether one of the best days of my life....thank you Roger and Freddie Baz bus tours.Roger also sent photos of the group via internet, completely free of charge (and that is a first for me) Thanks you Roger."

(this seriously is amazing!! we saw a wild zebra just hanging out while we biked!) and they also give you time to walk the Cape of Good Hope trail which is AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL! (I wild baboon walked next to us during this walk) 4- to meet a bunch of cool young travelers 5- a hilarious driver and very fun and informative guide (ROGER IS THE BEST!) You really want to book this day excursion because I don't think there is a better way to see the Cape! Roger and Freddy are amazing guides and really make the tour even more enjoyable! Roger gives you the perfect amount of info while throwing in jokes that kept the entire bus laughing and wanting more. The lunch they provide is good, but make sure you eat fast or you get a lot of food during your first go, because once the food is gone, it's gone! :) Freddy stops by a market at the beginning of the trip so make sure to pick up some water from the store or extra snacks... You'll want it while you bike, since the hills are actually harder than they look! Most people were sleeping in the van on the way back... demonstrating how amazing and fun the day was since the entire day was jam packed with fun, laughter, and beautiful scenery overload!"

Nothing felt rushed and I really like that, with the exception of the seal trip, all entry fees were included in the price (which would have added about R150 if paid on top). Highly recommended."

You start the day bright and early leaving from town and head to Hout Bay where you can take a boat to seal island and see all the seals dancing through the sea. After that you get rewarded with a yummy breakfast snack and head through Chapman's Peak on your way to the penguins at Bolders beach. But the real bonus is Cape Point Nature reserve where you get to cycle, enjoy a delicious lunch and two short hikes. Here you can really soak in the absolutely magnificent Cape Scenery.In general I found this tour really well organised and the tour guide was super friendly and funny. When the tour ended I felt like I had seen so much and had a super fantastic time. I would genuinely recommend this tour to anyone wanting see the beauty of the Cape Peninsula this Summer season!"

Freddy (our driver) and Mario (our guide) kept us all thoroughly entertained with their jokes and were so friendly and welcoming. Mario also provided an informative commentary on the areas we were driving through, as well as pointing out all the different animals we passed. The views along Chapman's Peak Drive and at Cape Point are beautiful and are not to be missed if you are visiting Cape Town. The whole trip was very well organised with just the right amount of time stopping in each place and a lovely picnic lunch. It was great to have the opportunity to stretch our legs with some cycling and walking. The bikes were not in the best condition, but this does not really matter as you aren't on them for too long and the ride is along a tarmac road. When comparing to all the other tours on offer, this really is the best value for money and doesn't disappoint. I would absolutely recommend Baz Bus to all my friends."

No air conditioning. Smelly. Not sure what I expected at that price... And then.... although the bicycles were very old and one of ours just broke totally and we had to walk, we landed up having a GREAT day!All in all, we understood that with this tour, we experienced Cape Town in ways we would not have on our own, in our own car. It was truly special. A note of warning to the not so young - the bicycle route is uphill in the beginning. Not easy for people not in shape. But you can walk it and then cruise down after the rise. The Flora and fauna are spectacular.The driver was very cautious and took no chances. And the guide did his best to accommodate and bind a rather diverse group. To his credit, he managed in the end! So, Kudos to the guide, the driver and the arrangement."

First of all - it's safe: you are picked up at 'your' door, and the driver will not drop you off if a place is closed or there is no one to meet you (in the case that you are getting another lift). Secondly - it's convenient: you don't have to worry about driving long distances, and on some pretty challenging terrain, and you are picked up with your bags right where you are leaving. Thirdly - it's friendly: the drivers are all nice and really informative along the way, and then there are also the other passengers, many of whom you will end up befriending and even traveling further with! It's not just a way of traveling - it's a lifestyle choice, because the journey to your destination also becomes significant and might change the course of your trip entirely!

The Baz bus offers the opportunity to explore the beautiful peninsula, a generally rocky peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean at the south-western extremity of the African continent. Tickets can be easily bought on internet. After picking you up from your accommodation, the tour continues along the Atlantic Seaboard to Hout Bay harbour, where we took a boat cruise to visit the Cape Fur Seal colony on Duiker Island. Then comes a visit to the endangered (and very entertaining) penguins at Boulders Beach in Simons Town. After a picnic we enjoyed a leisurely stroll to the South-Western most point of Africa. This tour is just the best value for money for independent travelers. The day we took the tour, our welcoming guide, Roger, turned it into a great experience. From the beginning he took the lead of the group in a very professional way. He was very knowledgeable of the region and shared a lot of information and interesting tips. The tour allows you to ride a bike for about 5 km, visiting the Peninsula in a different way . It\u2019s true that bikes are not in the best shape. But as far as you are, the experience will make up for it. I would highly recommend to take this tour when visiting Cape Town.The icing on the cake is that Roger has just sent me a few pictures of the tour, which are an unforgettable memory of the experience."

The picnic lunch was delicious, and the 45 minute hike down to the Cape of Good Hope was breathtaking. We spotted dassies, eland, penguins, seals and even a pair of orcas just off the beach at Cape Point.As local Capetonians we have visited these locations many times over the years, and there is always something new to see.

I did not take the boat ride to see the seals in Hout Bay and I don't think I missed out on anything special. We also rode bikes for 5 km in the national park. It was a short ride and didn't really seem worth it in the end. The bikes were so hard to pedal and the gear shifts didn't work, this made biking uphill very difficult. The lunch provided was picnic style where you built your own sandwich; it was very nice. This tour is also one of the cheapest deals you can find but service is above and beyond.

Roger was a wonderful guide and we would not have asked for a better day trip! Roger had a large amount of knowledge about Cape Town and its surroundings, but kept everything fun and light by adding his own jokes. Biking through the national park was nice to get out of the bus and spend some time in the fresh air. The scenery at Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope are unparalleled. Take the optional boat trip to see the Cape Fur Seals. Absolutely recommend the Day Peninsula Tour to everyone!!"

The driver Freddy 'Always ready' made all the passengers feel as if we were on a party bus. he is the funniest guys. I learned so much about Cape Town as a whole. We went to the seals, penguins, cycled in the park, walked up to the light house and hiked to the Cape of Good hope point. The muffins are nice and nice pace.

The stops were well chosen, especially the morning tea location overlooking Haut Bay, and Boulders Beach to observe the African penguins. A particularly good part of this tour is having the opportunity to cycle for 6km inside the Cape Point Nature Reserve and after visiting the lighthouse at Cape Point to take the cliff top walk around to the Cape of Good Hope."

Roger is a walking encyclopedia and knows every thing about modern day Cape Town as well as its history. Freddie is hilarious and cracked jokes the whole day. On the tour we took a boat to look at Cape Fur Seals, had coffee/tea on Muzinberg Beach, saw the African Penguin colony at Boulders Beach, took a bike ride through the Cape of Good Hope Park, and hiked down to the the actual Cape of Good Hope. Also, they provide a delicious lucy. Overall great day!"

I was by myself so booking a tour in such a hard weather was the perfect choice. The guide Mario picked me up in the my hotel and drop me off at the end of the day. Lunch was included and the price for everything we got was actually pretty good. Because of the cold and the win, the first stops were very quick. Just a couple of pictures of beautiful views and we were back in to the Van. Luckily the weather got better and we could enjoy the outside a bit more. We saw many animals in this short trip: Baboons, ostriches, birds... but the highlight for me was seeing the African Penguins in Boulders. Thousands and thousands of them. We went all the day to Cape Point and I totally recommend this tour. It is the easiest way to see everything and the staff are not only very nice but you can ask them everything and they will be happy to answer your questions.The bike ride to Cape Point was also cool.

My group was hesitant to pay that much, regardless of the popular attraction. When we saw BazBus' price, we were very excited \u2014 almost half price! However, such a price drop made me nervous about the quality of the experience ... but there was no need for that, I soon found. The sights, the tour guide Mario Jacobs, the history provided throughout the bus ride \u2014 all were wonderful! We had a well made lunch stop and a nice 5km bike ride to stretch our legs, plus we saw everything you would see in the more expensive tours (Chapman's Peak Drive, penguins at Boulder Beach, Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope, etc.). I definitely recommend the trip!"

The quiet power of the CoGH comes a close second.My only constructive feedback for Baz Bus would be to review the chocolate/caramel sweets they give out at the end, which we all spat out! It was a sweet gesture none the less and certainly got us bonding with our fellow travellers! Thanks team :-)"

In the park, you will have the option to do a bike ride. The ride is nice, although very windy on our day, and you'll need to be careful as it is on the main road. Following the ride, you'll get lunch - it's basic sandwich and chips, which serves its purpose, but if you're a picky eater or want something more substantial, just bring along.I do wish there was more time on the afternoon - I think our group was running behind so we did not have time to go down to the beach at the Cape Point, just the light house, then the Cape Point sign.Overall, a very enjoyable day trip!"

Fred was excellent driver and entertainer. We really enjoyed that day. Great work, Roger and Fred. We definitely want to use this company next time when we go to Cape Town again. By the way, Roger also shared the pictures he helped to take for our family when we were at Cape Peninsula. Everyone loved the pictures very much. Thanks a lot! A family from Chicago, USA."

Your then taken to Boulders beach in Simons town to see the cute peguins. Both destinations have souvenir shops to get some memorabilia. After an easy bike ride, they provided lunch which was delicious, fresh and filling. Cape point itself is just a wonderful sight to see and well worth the trip. It was peaceful to just stand there to appreciate Mother Nature and the fact that I was in South Africa. Great photo opportunities. There is a cable car, buts it's an easy 10 min walk. M and the girls at hq were also very helpful. They went above and beyond to help me with my little hair dilemmas, calling up a all their contacts to help me and I'm so grateful !

Visibility out the front is poor and I felt quite car sick at times.The website needs to make it clearer than many of the Baz Bus destinations actually require a separate shuttle to get there, and that the shuttles are NOT FREE. In fact, some of the shuttles are VERY EXPENSIVE. Baz Bus should make sure that the hostels do not charge more than 50 Rand per person for the shuttles. Some of the drivers made unscheduled stops to drop certain people off at specific locations which were NOT on the list of affiliated hostels (including the military barracks in Durban). This was infuriating, as it made the rest of us arrive late. Also, the drivers wouldn't make special stops for normal travellers, it only seemed to be people they were friends with or connected to somehow.The price of the 21 day ticked isn't much cheaper than hiring a car and is much less convenient - Baz Bus advertises that you can hop on and hop off wherever you want, whenever you want. This is misleading as the services only run every second day in most places and, as stated above, the Baz Bus doesn't even drop you directly at some locations (you need to get a separate shuttle)."

I passed on the bike ride due to a past experience of a spill I took on a scooter I didn't know how to handle so just rode along in the van. The hike up the Cape Point and to the Cape of Good Hope was a bit challenging for me scrambling over rocks, but I am glad I did it. The views are amazing and we had a perfect day. My only disappointment was it was not the real Baz Bus we were riding in and I wonder about Baz Bus advertising the 7 Day Chobe Tour which I took from Jo-burg later in my trip. That was outsourced to Selous Tours and did not meet my expectations at all. But I have heard the Baz Bus down the Garden Route is a good one and maybe I will try that next time. All in all, this Cape Peninsula Day trip is well worth it. Thanks Roger & Freddie!"

            "review": "Cape Peninsula Tour. We booked the Cape Peninsula Tour with Baz Bus after reading all the great reviews here. Though Baz Bus typically caters to the backpacking community, they were happy to allow us to book with them. Because we weren't staying at or near a hostel, we had to make arrangements to be picked up at the closest location from our hotel. We prefer smaller tours (versus the large buses that carry 60+ passengers), so this was just right for us.As many others mentioned, stops included Hout Bay (optional boat ride to see the Cape Fur Seals), Boulders Beach to see the African penguins, Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope. There's a lot to see on this tour, so of course, time is a little short in some places. But given the distance we traveled and how much we were able to see in one day, I felt it was good enough to see the highlights and move on to the next place.On the way to Cape Point, we stopped to go on an optional bike ride (if you choose not to ride a bike, you can ride along in the van). People's opinions have varied here on the difficulty of the ride. It's not very long (we were told 5K, but it didn't feel like it. Some thought it was half that distance), and there are a couple uphill climbs. In my opinion, while it's not a difficult ride, you should be in at least very basic physical condition to pedal small uphill climbs. The majority of the bikes seemed to be in good condition, but there were a couple that would not change gears, making the ride a little more difficult for some. Helmets were provided and required.Our guide, Mark, and driver, Freddie, were both very nice, funny and informative. The food included with the tour was also very delicious (muffins and juice after visiting Hout Bay and sandwiches, salad, chips/crisps, fruit, juice and water for lunch after the bike ride). For the price of the tour, I'd say it was a great deal and well worth it.I will say, though, that it's been a month since we took the tour, and I have yet to see the photos Mark took on the Baz Bus Facebook page. Mark took photos of the group along the tour and took photos of us on the bike ride. I'm a little disappointed that the photos have not been posted (I'm not sure if they were lost or posted on another page I'm not aware of), but I'm glad we took our own photos.I recommend this tour to anyone, not just backpackers, and not just the young but the young at heart. It's a great way to see some of the wonderful sights outside of Cape Town in one day, and all for a very economical price."

Like many other travelers, I purchased a 7 day ticket to go explore the Garden Route, which is for all intensive purposes an incredibly convenient way to navigate your way up the coast. You're able to go hostel to hostel on a predetermined schedule, and it helps nail down your travel plans a little. However, I also found the Baz Bus to not be as warm and welcoming as I had expected. People were somewhat quiet and reserved, and many opt for their headphones instead of conversation.However, the Baz Bus Cape Peninsula Tour was one of the friendliest, most welcoming tours I have ever taken. I was immediately greeted by a bunch of friendly faces and our tour guide Mark Fortuin, did a great job at melting the ice and ensuring that people got to know each other. He was also one of the most knowledgeable human beings I've ever encountered, consistently providing information about South African culture, geography and history, all packaged with a humorous twist. The tour itself covers a ton of ground, and really catches all of the highlights you'd want to see. You can see the seals, hang out with penguins, bike through the Cape Point National Park, do some short hikes, and watch ostriches cross the road. Perhaps at times it's a little rushed when you're moving around from place to place, but overall, I thought Mark and Freddie killed it when giving the tour. It was one of the most fun experiences I had in South Africa. So just know that this isn't necessarily the Baz Bus as you may know it from going up and down the Garden Route. This is the day trip to Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope that is way more social and crazy. Definitely hit it up, and be sure to photo bomb people at the Cape of Good Hope--it's just too easy and fun not to!"

It was such a pleasure to spend our day with them. They made sure everyone had a great time and kept us safe. The attractions they took us to were all breathtaking. From seeing the cape fur seals basking in the sun at hout bay to the cute African penguins at boulders beach, it was such a thrill for everyone, young and old. At chapman's peak we were rewarded with a magnificent view of hout bay, muffins, and really good juice.The peninsula is just stunning. The route we took winded along the cliffs, providing the most spectacular views of the ocean. The cherry on the top was the scenic bikeride through table mountain national park, where after we were served a delicious lunch that still makes my tongue water till this day. Later we were taken to Cape Point, where we walked to the lighthouse and then to the Cape of Good Hope. I've never seen so much beauty in one place, I could'nt believe my eyes at times. Luckily, we did not encounter and baboons, even though I secretly wanted to see them mess with us. Baz Bus was so grate that after the tour they brought us straight back to our hostel. Overall, we had an unforgettable experience that we will savor forever.The next day, our driver Freddy was so kind and agreed to take the four of us to the Christine Revell Children's Home. Before going there, we stopped by the Baz Bus HQ in Cape Town, where we met the whole Baz Bus team that make everything possible. We had a great time and pleasure talking to Melanie. Later at the orphanage, we were able to pass down the toys and some lollipops we brought from home. It was one of the most heartfelt experiences of my life. Without freddy, it wouldn't be possible. Thank you!Thank you again for making our stay in South Africa so memorable! We recommend this tour to EVERYBODY visiting Cape Town, it's a great way to get to know the beautiful cape. Be sure to check out the other Baz Bus services that include the hop on hop off service to destinations like Port Elizabeth and Durban!"

I together with my wife spent sometime in Capetown and we took to the baz bus tour to cape of good hope and cape point. we really enjoyed the trip and it was an awesome one. the best of it was having freddy(our driver) giving us muffins and drinks and shouting his usual jagons waki waki. and the other hand mark was not magnanimous to the baboons during our lunch break before the bicycle riding.in all i would say it was a memorable experience and cannot wait to do this tour again with baz buzz. thumbs up to mark and freddy you doing a good Job."

Great price and activities. I'm very glad I did this tour.

From Pick up from Ashanti Gardens our guide Mark was brilliant cracking jokes from the off which was great as we were a little worse for wear from the night before. I have done the Peninsula Tour before by hiring a car but the knowledge and facts Mark was giving us was well worth the money. Also the driver Freddie was a blast cracking jokes and silly rhymes which i have know clue where he got them from. You get very good value for the money , the tour lasts for around 8 hours and although this seems like a long time there plenty of time for lunch (which is provided) many photo ops and get to see everything from Cape Town all the way through the Peninsula. (Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, Boulders Penguins, Simon's Town and many more)Would recommend to anyone wanting to visit Cape Town and have a short amount of time to visit many places."

That isn't to say there's a military-style schedule to the day - this is Africa after all. Our friendly guide, Roger, made sure the day went smoothly and was a relaxed tour of everything from Duiker (seal) island (ticket's extra) to the penguins at Boulder's Beach. I enjoyed that there was some cycling and hiking involved further down the peninsula - the walk from Cape Point to the Cape of Good Hope was refreshing after a lovely lunch, and it was fun to hear the various stories of fellow travellers. Roger even sent photos that he took that day, a great extra effort to add to the memories! All in all a day well-spent, and great value for money too!"

I'm an Australian and It was a real pleasure for me to walk up to the lighthouse at Cape Point and look out to the Atlantic Ocean where my Scottish ancestors from the Isle of Skye would would have passed 168 years ago. Roger Airley (sic) was a great commentator and I learned a lot of historical information that he pointed out along the route. Freddie, too, was an extremely competent driver. Although i have rated this trip as excellent I would mention an improvement to management. I can't see the point in towing the bikes on a trailer over the fairly large distance travelled so that the tour group can ride bikes over six kilometres. There would be a considerbale cost saving in fuel if that part of the activity was deleted. Further, there is the risk that a rider might miss the pick-up point, and like me, end up cycling the whole way to Cape Point. That wasn't a problem for me but according to Freddie it's not the first time that a rider hasn't turned up and required an extensive search before being found."

I have seen and done a lot in one day and learned a lot from Rodger!The only real improvement point I have is BazBus should take responsibility on Tripadvisor. Every negative comment is being dismissed as the customers fault, others did like it and those kind of excuses. Customers are not always right and the feedback is not always fair, but own it. Try to create a solution instead of pointing at the customer. Blaming everything on them and not having any part in it as a company does not create a good image. I know other people have negative feelings about the way the complaints are handled, since we talked about it. It almost made me choose to not do this tour and I would have missed out cause I loved it!"

Top stop was definitely the penguins, and the cycle ride through the national park was really fun. The guide and driver were extremely friendly, and had a lot of interesting information to share on the drive! The food provided was really good, the big spread at lunch was exactly what we all needed after the cycle! Definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to travel the area!"

What can I say great tour, great staff!I love the variety to this day from boat ride to seals, to bike ride through a stunning national park, to a walk up to Cape Point to take in the panoramic surrounds and much more. You spend a while in the van travelling to these places as it is a way out of Cape Town but with such a knowledgeable guide full of fun facts and relevant trivia along the way you honestly don't notice it. I recommend this trip to anyone, great value, mix of backpackers and sightseers. The best part about this trip is you see places which would be hard to get to without a tour, you get all the interesting information to accompany it and you are in a small group :)"

I was only in Cape Town for a few days so this was a fantastic way to see the Cape.The tour started off by heading to Hout Bay where we took a boat out to a colony of seals. We then went on to Boulders Beach in Simons Town to see the penguins - didn't really expect to see penguins on the sand. This was great but the highlight was definitely once we got to Cape Point Nature Reserve. We cycled through the reserve and, having only been in Africa for a couple of days, I saw my first wild African animals (zebras) and then continued to climb to the top of Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope for breathtaking views!All in all, a fantastic day - helped also by our tour leader, Roger, who was really informative and interesting."

They were energetic, interesting and nice kids. And the tour guide Roger, who is an old genetleman, gave us wonderful and enlightening explanation about history, geography and all of interesting stories about Cape Town as well as South Africa. The driver was also amusing and nice guy, which always kept us laugh. Many thanks to them!And on Cape of Good Hope, we had a memorable hiking to enjoy different parts of the area, which might be physically challenging but unforgettable experience."

The guys were always on hand to take pics of the group to ensure we captured the special scenery, especially for those on the pics who were unable to take pics - Mark took pics and emailed these to us afterwards which was a nice touch and good to get some action shots. We saw some wildlife on the way, Baboons, ostriches and even whales from the bus! The trip was really good value and the Mark and Freddie did all they could to make sure we enjoyed our day.

We had bad weather for parts of it, but tour guide Mark's sunny disposition made up for the clowds! A word of advice to those who like me, will be riding a bike for the first time in their adult lives... Get someone on the tour to help you figure out the gears on your bike. The first half of the ride is uphill, and if you're in the wrong gear, you'll be super exhausted! The most fun part of the tour for me was the optional boat ride to see the seals. It was not the seals that were exciting, as much as the ride! Travelling out in to the bay on a little boat in choppy waters made us all realise just how courageous early travellers must have been... And it was just plain fun to be on nature's rollercoaster. Even the members of our group who normally suffer from sea sickness had a great time. I reccomend wearing layers and carrying a small rain jacket (it's cold at Cape Point, warm in the bus, and it will probably rain at some point on your journey)We saw wild seals, penguins, ostriches, baboons and buck. No zebra or whales, but who's complaining?!Frankie the bus driver and Mark the tour guide were helpful and jolly and made even the dull bits fun. All in all, I reccomend you do this early in your trip as it will give you a flavour of the region."

Roger also took pictures throughout the day and sent them out after the tour, which was a great way to get a few more shots from the day."

It picked us up from our hostel in the morning, (a little late due to some other passengers getting on the wrong bus!) and from the start Roger the tour guide was a font of local knowledge! We stopped in many lovely places; Hout Bay where there was the option of a boat ride to get closer to a seal colony, Boulders Bay to see the African Penguin colony, a bike ride through a national park before a simple but tasty lunch, and a trip to Cape Point followed by a short walk/hike to the Cape of Good Hope. We even drove through a small town called Scarborough on the way back to Cape Town, which was exciting for me as that is the name of my home town in England. It was a very enjoyable day, and considering it only cost us 490R each (we received a 50R discount as we purchased Baz Bus tickets from Port Elizabeth to Cape Town) it was excellent value for money. Roger and Freddie the driver were both friendly and pleasant people, and as previously mentioned Roger was full of interesting facts and information throughout the entire day.In reply to previous reviews, the bikes did not seem dangerous, the brakes were not as responsive as the ones on my bike at home but they certainly worked well enough for me!"

I don't usually go in for group tours but this was one of the highlights of my time in Cape Town... a sort of \"Cape Taster Menu\" that took in a bit of all the essentials - Hout Bay, Dekker Island, penguins in Simonstown, as well as the Cape itself. Our guide Roger was full of practical information and insight into the things we were seeing - from the wildlife to history, politics, sport... you name it! I felt a bit sorry for the folks in my hostel who decided to hire a car and see the Cape themselves as i think they missed out on a brilliant experience."

Even though we got picked up first (that means really early) we had a splendid day because from the first moment on our guide Mark was in a good moode and told us a lot of interesting facts about the penisula. The best part of the tour was - after my opinion - the bicycle drive - but check your bike first as advised because it is really hard work to drive with a broken one ;)I'd absolutely advise everyone to do the tour, it was totally worth the money!"

I realize that this review category is for the Cape Town day tour, but lacking another place to post, I'll post here.I went on the Kruger safari tour, which lasted four of the last five days of my month-long trip to South Africa, spanned my birthday, and was a fantastic experience. I had been nervous about being in South Africa alone (solo 37 yr old female) for the last part of my trip, and the tour was a perfect solution. I met some really great people, saw some amazing animals, and had what I suspect is one of the better guides in the country (Andre) as far as his knowledge of wildlife is concerned. Also (bonus!) I got to see the third largest canyon in the world and explore a pretty amazing cave system.I would definitely recommend the Kruger trip to others. I also had an opportunity to test Baz's customer service due to some miscommunication and stupidity on my end, and they really came through for me. It is my impression that they have good reviews and really work to keep them that way."

He has a wealth of local stories and anecdotes about the Cape that kept us entertained while travelling on our route. Highlights of the trip were the ferry ride to seal island off Hout Bay, a visit to the penguin colony at the Boulders, a bicycle ride through the nature reserve near Cape Point. Logistics, lunch, and the challenges presented by the Cape weather were all handled smoothly and in good spirit. After some rain, came some sunshine and we were treated to views of maginificent rainbows along the short walk near Cape Point."

Not to mention, the bus driver was the man! Our group got some great pictures and came face to face with a baboon. Luckily, we did not have any food for him to steal. For the price and what you see, this bus trip is great. The lunch could not be better and the bike ride was a nice addition to the experience. Make sure you get Mark as your guide and enjoy the ride!"

Our guide Roger was an expert. The tour information listed on the Baz Bus website tells you exactly what to expect on the drive. We did decide to take the (optional) boat ride to see the fur seal colony on Duiker Island, and although very windy, I would recommend it. We saw the African penguin colony at Boulders Beach but only got to go on the viewing platforms. This was the only downfall of the day because I was hoping to get on the beach to get a closer look at the penguins. We drove to Cape Point where we walked up to a lighthouse to take in gorgeous views of the peninsula and then hiked over to the Cape of Good Hope (45 min). Bring warm layers because the wind is brutally cold. I love that all of the attractions were included in the very affordable price. Well done, Baz Bus!"

There truly is'nt a better, more convenient, safer way for a young traveller to get the best out of a holiday down South Africas coast reaching out to far away places completely off route than the baz bus experience. I am 23 years old girl with a sheer passion for travel and people and throughout the many times i've travelled, i've never had more fun backpacking than i did on the baz bus from cape town to johannesburg then to durban. met so many cool faces along the way. Its easy -you purchase your ticket from a to b, hop on and off in one direction as much as you like inbetween both destinations knowing you have no hassles because they'll drop you off at your accommodation. Highly recommend the Cape peninsula trip which i got complimentary as id bought a long distance ticket. Had fun down the coast to durban from johannesburg as i made friends with most of the drivers- mzamo, jessie, ndumiso and lawrence - you guys are so amazing xxx! Hats off to mel at the cape town office who helped me with some good advice on how best to get the most out of my holiday, you're such a doll!

The bikes are rusty and we only get to ride for a very short distance before getting back on the bus to travel to Cape Good Hope"

Travelling around South Africa alone could be a nervy experience but with Baz Bus I have been travelling from Pretoria and am on the way to Cape Town. There are different ticket types and I have chosen a 2 week hop on-hop off ticket (unfortunately time constraints mean I cannot take more time to do this trip). Basically you can choose from well over 100 hostels and work your way down the stunning coast via the breath-taking Drakensberg Mountains. With so many fellow travellers, finding friends is easy. The vehicles are kept in good condition and the drivers are informative. This is a brilliant way to see South Africa, giving you the freedom to build your own trip and I would highly recommend it.see http://journals.worldnomads.com/butterfly-freed/ for more info on my trip"

To be fair, it happens very rarely as far as I'm aware. When we called them they apologised and payed for a taxi to pick us up, so it kind of made up for it.However, I was very dissappointed with the quality of the bicycles. The were in really bad shape so the cycling was a waste of time. The rest of the tour was okay, but in my opinion you are definitely better of doing it on your own. Although the guide was trying to make an effort and to be entertaining, it would have been nicer to visit the sites by car."

The tour was absolutely amazing both times. Looking back on my first visit to CT this was my favorite tour. Our guide Roger on both 1st and 2nd trip, was very helpfull and knows just about everything there is to know about anything. It's the cheapest Peninsula Tour and great value for my money. For further improvement I would suggest adding a bathroom break on the way back to CT, it's an absolute must when you've been walking for hours in the sun, and using the second entrance to the penguins on Boulders beach on weekdays, it costs the same and you can actually go down to the penguins there. We tried making it over there from the first entrance but there wasn't enough time. It would make the trip even better as a lot of people think they are going to go down on the beach with the penguins and might find themselves disappointed. Otherwise this trip has everything: bicycling, hiking, stunning nature, wild baboons, penguins, lunch included. Highly recommended."

Mark was a great guide, giving us lots of interesting information on the way and always willing to answer our questions - not to mention the good lunch, he prepared for us at the National Park.The tour is great for all those, who like to meet new people and see a lot in one day. Mark and our driver were always open for a chat and fit the tour to the ideas of the group - so THANKS for a great an fun day!"

I found the seal tour to be a bit of a rip off though, it was more expensive than some of the others and it didnt seem to stay out very long at all. Also thought the penguin colony in bettys bay was better but its not as easily accessible than boulders bay!would definitely recommend it to people who dont have a lot of time and want to see all the major attractions in Cape town."

I could have done without the bike ride as it was just on a surprisingly busy paved road in the park and didn't really add much to the trip. Everything else was great. The bus was nice, guide was good, and stops on the tour were ideal. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to explore the area and get to know more about it."

This was a great tour, it's A LOT in one day, but you get to see so much- cape point, the cape of good hope, the penguins along with a few other beautiful spots! You do a 6 km bike ride that while beautiful I much would have preferred more time with the penguins and just driven to lunch, because the 30 minutes they give you just isn't enough! Our Guide Nizzam was great and they pick you up and drop you at where your staying so that is also really nice! Overall great tour, just a little rushed in some points (mostly the penguins). I would still recommend it to anyone especially if your traveling with just a few people, since if you rent or hire a car the cost isn't much different and you wouldn't get to spend the time enjoying the views on the drive, some of which were pretty spectacular! I would highly recommend, but just be ready for a bit of a full and slightly rushed day!"

Our guide was very energetic and had a great character, our driver was very smooth and unnerving. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and found that our stops at Haut Bay, and Simons Town were timed just right to avoid crowds and so that we didn't spend time waiting around. The boat trip from Haut Bay to the seal colony was quite nice, and we saw plenty of seals in very clear waters. The bicycles could have been in better condition with a bit of TLC or upgrades needed. E.G. my bike had no brakes and couldn't change gears. The ride is not very challenging, riding only approx 5kms, slightly uphill but with rewarding views. The walks from Cape Point and then onto Cape of Good Hope were mostly on boardwalks with more steep downhill than up.There was plenty of food to go around for lunch which was fresh and tasty. We would recommend this trip to anyone who would like to get out of the city and see some of the country side."

The trip was very well organised and the guide Roger Airey was excellent - he was knowledgable and presented facts in an interesting and humorous manner. The trip took us to the fishing harbour of Hout Bay where we took an amazing boat trip (extra) to Seal Island. We saw hundreds of seals in their natural environment and the boat ride itself was an exciting 'roller coaster' ride over 3 meter waves. We drove along narrow Champan's peak with stunning views of the Atlantic,rocky mountains and white beautiful sandy beaches. The well thought-out-route took us through the fishing villages of Fish Hoek and Simon's Town to Boulders Beach where we stopped to see the famous Cape Penguins in their natural environment (entrance fee included in the Day Tour). From there we drove to Cape Point (entrance fee included in the Day Tour) and were lucky enough to see several baboons along the way! In the beautiful nature reserve, Edyn, my eldest daughter, did the bicycle ride to our picnic spot a few kilometers away. She loved the ride and said it was a unique experience to be on a bicycle with the blue sky overhead, the fynbos around her and the cool breeze in her face (highlight of her trip). Lunch (included in the price of the day trip) was very good and included fresh rolls (choice of white and whole wheat), fresh salad, pastrami and cheese, an apple and fresh fruit juice. After lunch we walked up to the light house to see the point where the 2 oceans (Atlantic and Indian) meet. Stunningly beautiful views. Then we took a lovely hike (about 45 minutes) down to the Cape of Good Hope - where we met up with the bus. The walk was exhilirating and the views breathtakingly beautiful. This was the highlight of the trip for me. From Cape Point we drove along scenic roads back to town. My girls and I absolutely loved the trip - from start to finish. Sharon, Edy and Noa - Israel."

I didn't do the Baz Bus day tour, but rather the Hop on hop off service that runs from Cape Town via PE and Durban and then inland to Johannesburg. The Bus stops at most backpackers along the way dropping you at the door. No need to rent a car! I hopped on in Cape Town and got Driver Kevin, he was very friendly and communicated with us all the way. I thought he was an exception, but in fact all the drivers were so good! keeping us informed with arrival times and if there were any delays etc. They often asked if we wanted to stop for food or if we would rather get ahead of schedule and arrive early at backpackers allowing more time to explore. The Bazbus is a GREAT way to explore South Africa, especially if you are on a budget. It's convenient and affordable. I met so many other backpackers on the bus who I made friends with and then explored the citys and towns with, which as a solo traveller was fantastic and helped make my trip that much more memorable.I will be sure to travel via Baz Bus if doing the trip again. Much recommended! Matt"

Saw some wildlife, took a boat trip, did a little cycling, got some great photos. The modern minibus is in great condition. Booking was efficient and painless. Nice picnic lunch and snacks included. The staff were great and in particular, our guide Grant, was fantastic! He had superb knowledge of the area (no questions could stump him), interesting things to say as he grew up around the area and had personal stories to tell and most of all a great sense of humour and infectious smile."

The pace was relaxed and the option to cycle a small part during the day broke things up and let you change pace if you wanted. Some gentle hiking and the chance to see the penguins was great. I'd recommend to anyone in a small group or travelling alone to do this as I met some lovely people on that day. Roger our guide was fantastic and gave some great info on the area. The picnic lunch was also lovely and the trip is great value for money!"

The drivers on all legs of the journey were great and good fun! Gavin was the best though and made sure that we were safely seen to our B&B even though it was off his route. He is a real ambassador for the company. I recommend using Bazbus not only because it's affordable but mainly because it is such fun to travel with them. You meet such a wide range of people and see South Africa at its best. Many thanks Yumna and Gavin - keep up the great work!"

I got the hint to go to see the Peninsular by BazBus by a friend and though admittedly never skeptical, the Tour itself was exceeding every hope. Pick up at the hostel is a luxury in itself as you will never have if not going by rental car yourself.Mario was our guide and a lot of fun, knowing obviously much about the country and the history but was able to light up the information with jokes, therefore it was no strict learning experience though one can\u00b4t help but taking the information in. The driver, Mark, was a miracle to me as he managed the big bus with bike trailer easily and skillfully. My deepest respects for some of the streets he passed in Cape Town!The bike trip was an adventure as the bikes admittedly are not in best shape. Breaking might be a matter of shear luck but then again this is not supposed to be a race but simply another way to enjoy the magnificent landscape.The landscape and nature are fantastic, there\u00b4s nothing more to say to it and the choice of stops is carefully made. I also very much appreciated the idea of being able to decide along the way if you want to do the things offered. Boat or rather not, bike or rather stay on the bus, hiking or driving down to the Cape in the bus - those choices make the BazBus Tour one that can be enjoyed by everybody. In the end there finally comes the longest drive back to the city when everyone is tired anyway and not eager anymore to walk around.Prize of the Tour is much worth it. I cannot imagine another tour with included pick-up, snacks, Lunch (a nice picnic right after the bike ride) and drop-of at your hostel again. So thanks a million to BazBus for offering this incredible trip with great company!"

The guide and driver were not only friendly and extremely helpful, but had a delightful sense of humor that put us all at ease! The variety of stops were appreciated and the lunch, although hardly gourmet, was thoroughly satisfactory.The only quibble I have was over the biking segment of the trip. Frankly, some of the bikes were not in all that good of condition and should be fixed or replaced. Furthermore, on the particular day we went, the wind conditions at the Cape were quite strong and so I hopped off the bike and rode in the van instead because the wind threatened to topple me over with traffic nearly running me over. So I think better care or warnings should be taken under such wind conditions.All in all - an incredible trip run by a great company! Two thumbs way up!!"

I had an amazing time, and would definitely recommend it. In responses to some of the things I read here are things you may want to know:- Cost \u2013 for everything you see and get it is the best value- Bikes \u2013 yes they\u2019re older but if you have a little patients they\u2019ll fix them up a  bit for you- Temperature \u2013 Yes it is hot, and no they don\u2019t run the AC on the bus or any of  the places you go.. I went in summer, this should be expectedWhy I recommend this:- Guide and Driver: Soo helpful and kind! Gave us options for parts to hike/  not hike based on the heat, took pictures, showed us interesting sites, great  lunch, wealth of knowledge- Friends: Traveled by myself and left the Baz Bus with a few new friends. It  was a diverse crowd but everyone was really friendly and we had a great  time together- Amount of sites: We kept a fast pace and saw a lot in a day! For someone  that is short on time in Cape Town, this is a great option!- Hike/ Bike: Enjoyed the balance between riding the bus, hiking and biking"

            "review": "Terrible Service, Overpriced and Unsafe. I took a day tour down to the Cape of Good Hope with Baz Bus in January 2012. As far as activities in Cape Town go it's definitely one of the most expensive choices but I went for it anyway because it made so many stops, offered lunch and a variety of experiences including site seeing, hiking and bicycling. In hindsight I wish I had partnered with people in my hostel to rent a car and left Baz Bus off of my itinerary. Downsides of my trip:-Aside from the driver's area the buses do not have A/C. In a 40C day this turns the rest of the bus into a miserably hot oven. You spend 8+ tortuous hours in this bus, it's miserable.-There are really only two interesting stops, the penguins (Boulder Beach) and the Cape of Good Hope. The rest of the trip is wasted time and/or costs extra (seal island is an additional fee).-The talking part of the tour is minimal, the guide shares only snippets of info, very little quality education about what you're seeing and its history. He spends the time making jokes about guests' countries of origin instead of providing info about the tour.-Bicycles are provided for a brief ride through the park but they're absolutely crap. The first bike they gave me was broken but I realized it right away and swapped for a second. The second bike they gave me broke during the ride but being that they do not have a sweeper following the group I was left to hitch hike out of the park!! I sent a message to to the trip leader with another bike that my bike had broken but I didnt know how far it would be, or how long it would take to get there. They give you a map but the tour guide told us he wouldnt come back looking for stragglers until 3pm, and it was 12:45pm when my bike broke down. He later said he was joking about the time but I of course I didn't know that and thought I was looking at 2+ hours in the blazing sun, which is what led me to hitchhike instead of just sit down on the side of the road and wait. When I finally made it to the meet up point the tour guide was shoving a sandwich in his face, didn't apologize even once for the broken bike/anxiety/scare and then said, \"oh sorry, we went bezerk on lunch\". They hadn't even saved me food! He later said, \"well, things happen, OK?\" I said \"No, it's no OK. Your bikes are garbage, totally not maintained and you put people out on the road on them without safety precautions to guard against incidents. It's anything but OK.\" He still never apologized or even acknolwedged that the incident was incredibly stressful for me.-The hike isnt 'easy' but it's well worth it. Bring water and keep buying refills at the stops as they never give you any along the way. Sunscreen and a hat are essential at the Cape of Good Hope, it can be blazing hot.-If you aren't fit then go with a buddy. As mentioned above, they don't use a standard sweeper method so if you break your leg or have problems on the hike they wont know about, they're waiting down in the A/C bus. Without a buddy you wouldn't be able to get a message to them.All together I think the Baz Bus day tour is way overpriced and very poorly run. This kind of operation wouldn't last a season in the states for safety reasons alone but owing to the very serious quality shortcomings too. If it was $30 or therabouts then maybe it's tolerable but at $70 (R550) it's a total rip off.I wish I had never done this tour and would absolutely recommend against it to travelers who can find an alternative way to get to the southern end of the Cape."

Our tour leader Roger was very kind and informative, even providing us afterwards with pictures of us as we were participating in the short (optional) biking portion of the program. There was just the right balance between meeting new people and being in a group and being able to take off on your own and do your own thing. Plus, there were options at each juncture for people of all fitness levels and desires. I highly recommend this tour."

We really wanted to see the sights of Cape Point and the Baz Bus tour was a fantastic way to do so.Our guide - Roger Airey - was helpful and knowledgeable about the area. There was never a dull moment in the bus with his commentary.We were collected from our hostel at 8am and the went to Hout Bay where there was an opportunity to see the seals. Next on to the dramatic Chapman's Peak drive which was spectacular. We then saw the penguins where - personally - I would have liked to tarry a little longer. Then down further towards Cape Point where we rode bikes for 5k or so which was brilliant fun.We stopped for a basic but filling lunch of cold meats and salad following the cycle ride. Juice was available. I would suggest Baz Bus consider giving people who wish to the opportunity to purchase a cold beer at this point.Finally, it was on to Cape Point itself and then a short hike down to the Cape of Good Hope before back to our Hostel around 5pm.Overall, a really enjoyable day which managed to take in all the sights while still offering you the opportunity to get out of the bus and stretch your legs. Our guide Roger was really good, even taking the trouble to email us some pictures he'd taken on the day which I thought was a lovely touch. Finally, compared to the other tour operators the price is very competetive making this a great value-for-money day out."

He is addicted to the computer and T.V. and I can never get him out of the house! He eventually relented and had ' the best time of my life!'. Good food, wonderful walking in nature, perfect weather, good company and tour guide on Baz Bus was superb and welcoming. My son was happy, he experienced Seal Island, Cape Point, Penguins at Boulders and much more. Thanks for a trip of a lifetime and good memories. Elana & Yoni"

They advertise as a \"stop-on stop-off\" anywhere on your route but the reality is that you have to stop where the mandatory stops are... this was a problem because one of the mandatory overnights was in Durban during a huge worldwide conference - making it impossible to get a place to stay overnight, therefore making it impossible to continue on our route. If you don't make it to the mandatory stops you don't proceed. The woman who booked our tickets at the African Center would not help us book a hostel in Durban - she told us we would be fine or we could give her R30 to make a phone call. What a Joke!!! Then they almost didn't let us on because we didn't have a hostel booked - all we had was our ticket. They don't stop for sights - only at gas stations for food - and its super uncomfortable. The seats don't recline and most of the people on our bus smelled really bad - showers anyone? The drive from Durban to Port Elizabeth turned into a 17 hour nightmare - stopping at 930pm for dinner at a gas station that had no food left - we had popcorn and water for dinner - then arrived in PE at 130am... Horrible. We scrapped the remainder of our ticket and rented a car - the best thing we ever did - to complete the garden route - too many missed picture opportunities while on the bus! - my advice - splurge on a car and find some friends if you don't have the money. SA is too beautiful to miss because you are on a stinky, crappy bus!"

The day is absolutely jammed packed full of wonderful activities. Our tour guide, Grant, was stunning at his job. He's been leading tours for four years, he does everything very smoothly and has great comedic timing. Grant is very knowledgeable about South Africa, and is interesting to talk to because he can speak frankly about the history of South Africa--very helpful for a tourist to get a real run-down.He guides you through a really wonderful day, and he's very friendly and approachable--so if you're doing this tour alone, don't worry, he makes it very comfortable. The day is very planned out but not regimented.My favorite part is that he's very accommodating to his tour groups by snapping any pictures of them they want!Baz Bus is the perfect choice because you meet adventurous people, vs. stodgy tour groups (and they are everywhere!), it's an affordable way to do it, the fees are included and they provide lunch. Also, the Baz Bus will never leave you behind, they are accountable for you and so they will wait if people are running late--which is just so helpful!!!I love Baz Bus and cannot recommend this enough!"

Less that 24h later, the bazbus website announced a special offer which is if you buy a ticket with Bazbus you get the Peninsula Tour for free. I was surprised at the beginning because I felt that I missed this offer for less than 24 hours. When I wrote an email to Bazbus I was agreeably surprised that the lady who took care of my booking was not aware of the special offer made by her Director and proposed a refund of the Peninsula Tour. I was extremely happy for this proposal not only becaue of the saved amount but also it gave me a great taste about a tour company which is not greedy and I really felt that I made the right choice when I booked with bazbus.I will send a detailed report once back from my trip and I'm already sure that I will be just awesome!"

It is a great way to see the stunning landscape around Cape Town, especially when you don't have your own wheels. Besides that the Baz Bus team is really awesome and gives a lot of interesting facts combined with a lot of fun! The tour started with a scenic route through Cape Town (Clifton, Camps Bay) to the lovely harbour of Hout Bay where we had the opportunity to take a boat to a seal island. We also tasted some seafood - the calamary there is the bomb! Than the tour took us along Chapmans Peak, the most beautiful coast drive. We even saw whales on our way to Simons Town! There we visited the African Penguin colony - a very unique experience to see those kind of animals chilling on the beach between palme trees :)! Next stop was National Park where we did a nice, little cycling tour to Cape Point with a delicious picnic stop with sandwiches, olives, fruites, juice etc. My favorite part of the tour was the following hike from Cape Point to Cape of Good Hope. The path is very good and the landscape is just overwhelming! If you have time hike down to Diaz Beach!To sum it up: we had a stunning day packed with a lot of great experiences. It had the right mixture between information, sight seeing and action. I would suggest Baz Bus especially because of its great guides and the fun atmosphere. Thanks a lot!"

So, we signed up. They were having a special so it was cheaper than normal. We had a personable guide. We went to the harbor to take a boat to see the Seals, then to the Penguin Reserve, bike riding through the national park, hiking up around the tip of the Point and then back to our hotel. I would recommend it because it was a great way to see the areas that are difficult to get to without a car. It's a big pricy for what it is, but everything is Africa is overpriced."

I would give the edge to Simonsig because their excellent Shiraz offerings. Note that the selection of wineries may change with each tour on account of availability and scheduling. You really can't go wrong with the South African wineries, however, either on account of the wines offered or the bucolic settings.At Franschhoek, we had an excellent lunch at the French Connection restaurant. The menu was extensive and highly affordable, and we were allowed to uncork our two bottles of \"Mackenzie\" wines just purchased at Hartenberg. Several of us ordered the sliced kudu (large antelope) steak, which was juicy and delicious, a perfect match for our wines!Cape Town is a wonderful city to visit, but it's not easy to visit either the Cape of Good Hope or the Cape wineries if you don't have a car. Tim is a knowledgeable and charismatic guide who showed us all of these places and greatly enhanced our visit. And he was very patient with our sometimes chaotic seven-person group.

One was a wine tasting day in Stellenboch and the other was a Peninsula tour. Both were absolutely fantastic! Tim was able to accommodate everything we were looking for... My two friends were interested in doing some port tasting, so he managed to squeeze a place in for them - even on a Sunday! The wineries he chose were all wonderful.On our second tour, we went to the peninsula and saw penguins at the reserve and seals along the way. We also stopped in multiple bays along the way and ate at a fantastic restaurant for lunch. We made it to the Cape of Good Hope and Tim let us stop at several scenic areas to take photos and point out wildlife. He was extremely knowledgable about the history of South Africa and we learned a great deal from our time with him.I would highly recommend Friends of Dorothy tours to anyone who is in Cape Town.

Originally we asked to do a peninsula tour but we did say - if the weather is going to bad - please just think of something else for us to do.When we met him - he informed us that the weather was miserable and that he recommended that we do the wine tour. Being wine drinkers - we were 100% fine with that suggestion.On our way to do the wine tasting - we learned about the history of Cape Town and little other tid bits of information. The information that he shared, along with his personal stories helped paint a picture of what life is in South Africa and Cape Town.Being someone that loves to learn about the culture and identity of an area - this was perfect.The wineries that he picked were great - along with the lunch location. Now this might not seem like a big deal - but I called him on a Sunday (on Sundays 85% of wineries are closed) at 9:30 am for a 10:30 am start. So yes - he pulled off a Superman like moved and rescued the day."

The first was the winelands of Stellenbosch and surroundings (\"Yellow Brick Road\") and the second was Cape Peninsula with False bay, penguins, Cape of Good Hope, Cape Point Nature reserve (\"The Ruby Slipper\").On the Winelands tour we stopped at some really beautiful wineries, but also got to see Stellenbosch, Franschoek and the beautiful surroundings. Our guide Tim helped us pick out wineries, but was also very flexible to the changing wishes of the group. While driving Tim told us a lot of fascinating stories about Cape Town, wine making, different grapes etc. All in all it was a marvellous day, filled with wine, good food and beautiful sights.The next day we went on the Peninsula tour. We went through Simon\u00b4s town (where we were introduced to Just Nuisance), via the penguin colony to Cape of Good Hope. Here we had a walk through the Cape point nature reserve and then went for a great seafood lunch at restaurant Two Oceans. We saw a lot of different animals, but were also amazed by the flowers. Unlikely at it seems the group agreed that this day was perhaps even better than the first one! The sights along the coastline are absolutely unforgettable. Whoever books a trip with Tim is in for a real treat. He is incredibly knowledgeable, and has a deep understanding of so many subjects (Cape Town history and politics, wine and winemaking, architecture, birds, plants...) paired with a gift of delivering anecdotes. I learned (and laughed) so much during the two days! Tim is also the perfect host, engaging everyone in the party and making sure all are having a good time.In short: when in Cape Town, day touring with Tim Freeman of Friends of Dorothy is something not to be missed!"

We stopped just short of Hermanus at the top of a peak to look down at the amazing coast and view from above, but also to try to spot where the whales may be. We then made our way to Hermanus. Such a beautiful quaint little town and the coast line was spectacular! Crashing wave over a rocky coast. There was a cliff trail that you could walk along or sit and watch. We spotted several whales, from a distance, but still was so cool to see!Then we went to lunch on the waterfront with Tim and had great food, sat outside, and even saw several whales breach during lunch!We then drove to Betty's Bay where they have the African penguin colony. This place was great! Less touristy than Simon's Town, Boulder's Beach (so we hear), and we were able to get closer to the penguins, there were 100's!Our drive back was the coastal route/scenic route along Chapman's Peak Drive. The sun was setting and the view was phenomenal! We even saw baboons walking along the wall on the side of the road! Tim is an amazing tour guide! He is fun, easy to get a long with, and very knowledgable about the area and the history of Cape Town, and enjoys telling you about it!I highly recommend booking a private tour with Tim. Thanks Tim!"

This review is a bit overdue, but after a few weeks I am still thinking about my two days on the wine trails, how much I learned about he area, and how much fun we had. The first day, Tim collected me and two friends from the Hotel in Cape Town. Driving out to the wine country, he pointed out important landmarks, interesting historical attractions, and fun facts about the area you're sure not likely to get on other tours. We started day one in Franschoek as Tim fulfilled our request to focus on some of South Africa's best sparkling wines. We toured three wineries, had a fantastic lunch at Delaire Graff, and purchased more wine than we knew what to do with. For anyone looking for a gay friendly tour operator, Friend's of Dorothy is it (as one might assume). Day two of the wine excursions included myself and 4 gay friends from London that I'd recently met at a wedding. While always professional, Tim made this day even more fun. The humor and jokes flowed as freely as the wine and rain that day. We toured several spectacular estates, purchased even more wine, had a Delicious lunch and one of South Africa's best, Overture. I was looking for a gay friendly wine tour, and was connected to Tim through Out in Africa tours. I'm so glad to have made the connection."

We had one day in Cape Town stopover while on QM2, I had organised with Tim to take us to Table Mountain, Stellenbosch Botanical Gardens and a winery. Our cruise ship was late arriving due to high winds but Tim was waiting for us in his nice, clean people mover. He had advised us to buy tickets for the cable car for table mountains online before we arrived. This saved us a lot of time as the queues to buy tickets let alone getting on the cable car was very long. We got there long before 4 bus loads from our ship had arrived and had 45 minute wait to get to the top. Tim pointed out quite a lot of interesting information. We then went to botanical gardens where we tried different South African foods in the cafe and then Tim took us for a walking tour of the gardens and once again was very knowledgeable and pointed out many interesting plants. He also managed to take us to a very nice winery called Klein Constantia for wine tasting. We had a great time and saw so much in a day.We definitely recommend booking Tim."

We are in our 70s and are still fairly agile, but without Tim's guidance and help we would not have accomplished half of what we did with him. After hearing the things we wanted to do and see, he managed everything. He did the driving, arranged reservations, chose places for lunch, etc. He made excellent additional suggestions.We toured Cape Town itself both walking and driving where we saw District 6, the Castle, the Company's Gardens, Signal Hill and more. Since our four days with Tim were on alternate days spread out over a week, Tim showed us many places we could return to on our own (including Table Mountain, the Slave Lodge, the Anglican Cathedral, and others). Outside the city, we went to the superb Hartenberg winery estate, the beautiful Kirstenboch Gardens, and the fruit and vegetable gardens in Babylonstoren. Along the way we stopped at places to sample artisan chocolates, craft beer, and olives. We went to Simon's Town and Betty's Bay to see the penguins and stood on the Cape of Good Hope. The drives to and from these places were beautiful. The mountains and beaches are fantastic sights.Tim also arranged for a tour of Langa Township with a guide from the community itself. It was a sobering and enlightening experience. I helped us contextualize our trip in the context of South African history, culture, and current affairs. We were a bit apprehensive but there was no need to have been. The people of Langa Township welcomed us. We recommend this visit stronglyNever did we feel rushed. Although we went many places in a few days, we had ample time at each of our destinations. With Tim doing the driving, it eliminated all of the extra time required to schedule a tour on one's own and to figure out how to get to places!It was more than worth the money. We visited Amsterdam on our own before flying to Cape Town. We did quite well there but Cape Town with a tour guide--especially Tim--was much more successful.Tim possesses a broad and deep knowledge of Cape Town and South Africa which he eagerly shares with his clients. He is very articulate and speaks clearly. We had no problem hearing him in the back seat of his comfortable SUV. He also thrives on his clients' suggestions, questions, and opinions. At times he had to remind us that we should be looking out the window!Tim is an affable, cheerful traveling companion. We felt that we had made a friend. Our advice is to seize the opportunity to engage Tim as a tour guide. You won't regret it for a minute. Our visit to Cape Town and environs was the trip of a life time and Tim Freeman was instrumental in making it so!"

In Cape Town, one major educational goal was to learn about the different populations of South Africa. Tim delivered in spades. We started our day with an overview of the European history, focused on Central Cape Town. Highlights for us were the Company Gardens, the flower market, District Six, and Groote Kirk. We then headed up to Signal Hill for the noon gun. It was an exciting ride up the hillside and we got there just in time.Next was the Cape Malay district where we admired the cheerfully painted homes, saw the prettiest mosque in Cape Town, and visited a spice shop. We had a curried-chicken lunch in a cook's home, and learned to make samosas. The food was delicious, and the conversation very informative. This was the first time my husband had been in a Muslim home, so he was very interested in the art work and the family's day-to-day life. Finally, we ended our day at Langa Township. This was simply amazing. We learned so much about the township system, how/when/why people moved to Cape Town after the fall of apartheid, and the community itself. We were happy to see people's pride in their community and the projects in place to help people learn a trade or craft. To be honest, it was a little uncomfortable to be visiting a community in such an intimate way, peering in to their homes and picking our way through the narrow paths. Visiting Langa, however, was vital to our understanding of South Africa, Cape Town, and Apartheid. (After all, traveling is all about experiencing new and different things, and if you're really trying to do that, you're going to be a little uncomfortable once in a while.) Note, however, that we were warmly welcomed by the Langa guide, the Langa children, and the people we met along the way.Tim's knowledge about the city was vast. He was able to answer all of our questions in great detail. His fellow \"teachers\", our cook in the Cape Malay district, and our local Langa guide, were friendly and welcomed our questions. They all had clear pride in their cultures, businesses, and communities. One downside of the tour for us was that the morning and lunch portion of the tour was very quickly-paced. We felt as if we were rushing through several elements. If I were to do this again, I'd want to take it more leisurely and break it in to two days."

His level and breadth of knowledge is remarkable, On top of that, he is witty and passionate about South Africa and his tours and, most important, very good at understanding and tailoring the tour to your interest. Highly recommend!"

We hired Tim as our private guide for 2 full days while we were in Cape Town. We also hired him to plan the rest of our 12 day itinerary for after we left Cape Town. We were extremely pleased. He did an outstanding job. Tim knows so many off the beaten path interesting places - places that only a long time resident knows. He also has a firm grasp of history, and is very good at spotting wildlife. We were especially pleased because he crafted a personal tour for us based on our interests, not his. As an example, we do not drink alcohol, so the typical wine tasting was not for us. However, In lieu of wine tasting, Tim came up with a \"dark chocolate tasting\" tour at a family run gourmet chocolate kitchen. It was one of the highlights of my trip. He also arranged for an olive oil tasting for us. I tend to ask a ton of questions, and unlike many guides, Tim was always able to answer my questions, and so far, none of his answers have proven to be incorrect.When we return to South Africa we definitely plan to hire Tim Freeman as our guide again. He was great!"

We had a wonderful time and an awesome day, mostly due to Tim and his tour. He is the perfect mix of personable, knowledgeable, organized and fun. He will tailor your tour so that it fits your interests and schedules. The lunch he arranged was delicious and memorable, as were trips to visit a township, the coast, penguins, Sea Lions, Gardens, Big Bang, etc. etc. He is also a wealth of knowledge about South Africa and its history, as well as a great story teller. I would highly recommend Tim and Friends of Dorothy Tours. Whether you are a couple, group of adults or a family with children, he will create a perfect day that is sure to be memorable and special. We hope to return to Cape Town and stay longer, and when we do, we will definitely call Tim again."

Our family [including 2 young adult sons] had Tim as a private guide for two chock full days in Cape Town. Tim was responsive even before we arrived by exchanging several emails asking us detailed & pertinent questions so he could plan an itinerary that fit our family's needs. He listened very well and knows all the ins & outs about Cape Town so we always felt in good hands. In 2 days, he took us up to hike around Table Mountain, a full City Tour hitting the highlights of Cape Town central, arranged a private Cape Malay cooking lesson in a private home in BoKaap, a tour of a township including visiting inside personal homes, a lovely day in Stellenbosch winelands with wine tasting and gourmet lunch. Any guide can take you to those places, but what distinguished Tim was his depth of knowledge and enthusiasm to share the history and inside stories of each place- really made the history come alive. On a practical level, Tim was on time, followed through on everything he promised and managed to meet the interests of the parents and the younger adults. Sign up for Tim when you go to Cape Town!"

As well as wine tasting, he was able to arrange for us to visit a couple of places that do cheese tasting. Tim has lived in Cape Town for nearly 30 years and has a great perspective on the history and culture of the city and South Africa in general. He also knows a lot about wine and food and is great company."

When we hire a private guide, it is important to us that the person is not only knowledgeable but that they are fun and personable in addition. We were in touch with a number of private guide companies in Cape Town and ultimately chose Tim from Friends of Dorothy for two full days of touring. Tim really paid attention to what we wanted and helped us plan two customized days of touring rather than the preplanned itineraries that other companies offered. We did a day down the Cape peninsula and a day in the Winelands. Each day included fabulous food and some stops that were more popular among locals than tourists.Tim had an unfortunate accident shortly before our trip. He went above and beyond to make sure that he put us in touch with his replacement, Anine, and that we were satisfied with the substitution. Anine turned out to be charming, full of information, and a delight to be with. She even helped us choose restaurants for our dinners and made sure we had reservations. We were delighted with our two days of touring and highly recommend Friends of Dorothy."

He picked us up at the hotel at 9.00 in the morning, and our trip started with a short stop at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens. He has great knowledge and gave us an introduction to the beautiful and special flora this area is known for. Then we went to the False Bay Coast at Muizenberg and the surfer 's corner. We drove on to Kalk Bay harbor to see the Cape Fur Seals, and at the local fish market we also got a little introduction to the \u201ccatch of the day\u201d! After Simon\u2019s Town and Boulders Beach with the penguins, we headed into the National Park. We walked from Cape Point to Cape of Good Hope, a 40 minutes beautiful walk. Tim met us down there with the car, and from there we drove back along the Atlantic Ocean to Noordhoek, where we had lunch at The Food Barn. We had a nice break with great food and a fun and interesting conversation with Tim. After lunch the drive went on back to Cape Town through Chapman's Peak and Hout bay, a beautiful drive!

He also knows his wines so was able to pick the wineries where we could experience our particular preferences in wine. All in all a wonderful day out and highly recommended. John and Greg"

Tim from Friends of Dorothy made all arrangements, picked us up at our Cape Town hotel in the morning for the best day of our already amazing trip. He took us out to the Cape of Good Hope, encountering on the way penguins, baboons (do not open your car window), ostriches, something that looks like a giant guinea pig, gale force winds, crashing waves, surfers, an excellent lunch, history, poetry, and witty conversation. Recommend you wear sunscreen, good walking shoes, and sunglasses. Scenery is beyond description. Cameras cannot capture, so leave those at the hotel and drink in the experience. We have another tour scheduled with him tomorrow and can't wait!"

Tim picked me up at the airport and gave me a quick tour of Cape Town and then again the next day for a tour of the peninsula and wine tasting. The days flew by and Tim is so very knowledgeable on so many topics - yes even mountain climbing and the English influence in South Africa and we had a great time exploring Cape Town. I immediately felt comfortable with Tim as I was traveling alone and was very thankful I had taken the time to spend two days in Cape Town during my travels through South Africa. I learned so much and wondered how much others miss when visiting Cape Town without a guide like Tim. We covered a great deal of territory and even squeezed in some shopping at his local favorites - all of who knew Tim and welcomed him and me. Great day Tim, thank you so much and I will ask for you again during my next trip to Cape Town. Deb"

He figured out the best route and didn't disappoint! We visited Fish Hoek, Shelly Beach, Simon's Town, the Penguin Colony, the Cape of Good Hope, Chapman's Peak Drive. We wanted to have lunch at the Food Barn, so he planned a stop there as well. Our last stop of the day was Constancia Farms Winery. We can't say enough good things about Tim!

We couldn't be more pleased with the all-day tour of the Cape winelands that Tim Freeman helped to coordinate. We wrote to Tim in advance of our trip to South Africa and shared with him a list of wineries we were interested in visiting around Stellenbosch, Paarl and Somerset West. Tim was very helpful in asking us what our personal interests were (serious wine tasting, sight-seeing, architecture, etc.). He made some suggestions for wineries he thought we might enjoy and politely suggested that some of the wineries we thought of visiting were either very remote or might be limited in their wine selections. Tim picked us up from our hotel in his roomy and comfortable van, showed us the cooler he had packed with water and refreshments to enjoy during our tour, and confirmed our time schedule. We were very impressed with how knowledgeable and witty Tim is. He not only made personal introductions to the staff at each of the five wineries (and our lunch-time restaurant as well), he made sure that all tasting and entrance fees were taken care of so that we didn't need to worry about extra expenses. He pointed out interesting plants, birds and animals along our journey, picking up on the fact that we had just come from a safari in Botswana and Zambia. Tim is very personable, professional and well-prepared. We were thrilled that we were able to visit five wineries on a gentle and comfortable pace without having to worry about directions or details. We enjoyed Cape Town so much we are sure we will be returning to South Africa again soon. We will be sure to book another tour with Tim and Friends of Dorothy Tours! Enjoy!"

Added to the excellent lunch overlooking the sea near Cape Point it was exactly what I had wanted from the tour. When you can see big coaches disgorging 70 or 80 people who just want a photo at the Cape signpost, it's clear how worthwhile a good guide is. Tim threw in a Cape Town tour on the way out of town, stopped frequently and flexibly and has a great deal of humorously delivered knowledge to share."

Tim has a natural friendly style and is very well informed about the area. His clean and comfortable vehicle (VW T5 minibus) had supplies such as water and snacks - plus some umbrellas (which were needed for this Cape Town winter weather). We were picked up from our hotel as planned at 9am and we followed his route around the cape which took advantage of the (little) sun and meant we avoided most buses/coaches. There were four of us and we feel this tour was good value for money. It is worth investing more in a personal tour and having a guide meant we learnt a lot more about the area and its history. We had a really good day and we are sure you will too! Many thanks to Tim."

I contacted Tim prior to arriving and described what we were interested in doing - a tour of the wine country, preferably including some wineries that were a little more off the beaten path. Tim picked us up at our hotel around 9:00 am and we headed towards the Stellenbosch area. We toured three wineries over the course of the day including a lovely one with a Japanese style tea garden. Tim was knowledgeable and entertaining; frequently quoting poetry to illustrate a point. Over the course of the day, we chatted about wine, history, the areas we were visiting and a wide range of subjects. He made changes to our itinerary as we went based on comments we made. For example, after I talked about how much I loved to cook, he added in a stop at an olive farm where we sampled different olive oils made on site. Tim sent me a list of restaurant recommendations and I had selected three that I thought we would enjoy. We had a wonderful lunch at La Petite Ferme which was one of the three on my list. All in all the day fit perfectly with what I had envisioned and I would highly recommend Tim for anyone interested in doing a tour."

Three of us decided to take a day tour of the Winelands and having been so impressed with Tim from 'Friends of Dorothy Tours' on a previous visit to Cape Town we booked again. It was a fantastic day! Tim really goes the extra mile to personalise the experience so that you feel this is not just another tourist day tour. Our friend was convinced she loved only red wine and Tim took us to try some great reds. He also took time to chat with our friend for some time and then took us to a fantastic vineyard to challenge some of our ideas - and he was right she (and we) loved the white wine we were trying. Tim also took time ahead of the trip to find out our lunch preferences and so we had a magical (and incredibly good value) wine tasting lunch on a vine covered terrace in beautiful surroundings. Later Tim could see we were looking for something different and suggested chocolate tasting - another great idea.More than anything the tour is memorable for the informed and entertaining style Tim maintains for the whole day and for the comfort of the spacious tour van. We paid a little extra for the private tour (just three of us) which gives you great flexibility. Our previous tours (in a bigger mixed group) were also excellent and I never saw Tim phased at all by any of the questions or demands aimed at him. The Cape Tour was particularly entertaining and informative.If you are looking for a fun and entertaining day with the reassurance of knowing you are safe in the hands of an expert then we heartily recommend 'Friends of Dorothy Tours'."

Peter isn't just a photo coach (and what a photo coach!), he's also a tour guide and knows so many fun stories and historical facts. Because he wears both hats, we got the best tour with the most fantastic scenes! We all were having fun with him by the time we got to breakfast. :)Peter was very patient with me. I love taking nature photos, but I was such a newbie. I didn't even know how to do anything on my camera but put it on auto and click. He never made me feel inadequate and was very encouraging. He had handouts to remind me of what he was teaching. He showed me how to apply all the information, too. Most importantly, while he made suggestions on angles or settings, he was never cross or pushy. He let me make mistakes and then made suggestions. This is how it should be done."

He was very friendly, laid back, and definitely had a great sense of humor. Our pace for the day seemed easy going and yet we covered a tremendous amount of ground! Peter gave me great direction on some camera settings and composition. We got some great sunrise shots, covered the penguins, and the best was shooting the children of the Langa Township. This was such a special experience and I can truly say that I shot some of the best portraits ever! The children are beautiful and Peter has an amazing relationship with the people of the township. It is very apparent that he has worked hard to build a trust with them and due to that trust he can bring people there to experience something that would otherwise be impossible. I loved the children! The were simply wonderful and so photogenic! I cannot say enough about the great day I had! The penguins were also very cool!

The whole family was immediately comfortable with him, and enjoyed every minute of the day. Peter is an excellent teacher. It was evident that he did his homework on each of our cameras, and was able to teach each of us at our own level. He mixed a lot of history and information about Cape Town into the day as well. Each member of the family ended the day with a sense of pride at having improved our photography skills and learned a lot about his beautiful home, Cape Town. I highly recommend an excursion with Peter to anyone at any level of photography skill."

Last month I did my third photography weekend with Peter at The Hex river valley.The other two that I have done are the Sutherland star trails and the paternoster weekend away.All three were of a similar standard \u2013absolutely fabulous!The photography part: Peter spends a lot of time finding good photo shoots around the area .The briefing beforehand is also very useful ,as well as the discussion of the photos afterwards. He also provides notes ,so that you remember what setting and approach was used to take those special shots .On site, he spends time with every person to show different perspectives to capture the shot as well as useful advice.The Hex river valley focused on colourful landscapes,the Sutherland one on star trails and the paternoster weekend on seascapes.accommodations and food etc.: All of the accommodations(bed and breakfasts) were very comfortable and clean. They were central so that not much travelling needed to be done before a shoot. The food was great (and I was catered very well despite being the only vegetarian).The hosts were extremely friendly and warm.I would highly recommend the photo tours with Peter as he goes the extra mile to make you get the best shot, as well as making your feel comfortable and at home.Besides getting great photos ,you also end up with a fun weekend away:-)"

Excitement mounted as I dusted off the cabin fevered camera and equipment to embark on the most incredible photographic full days tour with renowned photographic mentor and tour guide, Peter Haarhoff who not only entertains you his great sense of humor, but his knowledge of the area, it's history and culture and photography talents are unparalleled. I was instantly at ease with trying out a new camera with his informative 'what/how to do' approach and soon felt enthused, encouraged and confident again. Together with my good yachtie friend, we started with Peter driving us on a 2hr game drive (have good shoes for walking close to animals), followed by wine tasting (buy the wine and champagne here...it's fantastic), a delicious lunch at a nearby bistro (you'll find this to be an experience too with an eclectic mix of people, cockerels running under your feet, beautiful surrounds, together with excellent food, price and friendly local service), a butterfly tour which incorporates birds, reptiles and more (can be hot inside), then ended the day at the Lion park sanctuary watching them feed, as the sun dipped behind the majestic Cape mountains - what an experience! Cant wait to do the next tour with Peter, so I guess sailing will just have to wait!"

Peter strikes a perfect balance between first and foremost teaching you the fundamentals of good photography while secondarily familiarizing you with the area and teaching you about the culture and history. Peter is hands down the best ambassador for his city-- we absolutely loved spending the day with him. He's friendly and funny and a complete delight. I have dabbled with photography on and off for years but never really taken a lesson on the fundamentals and my husband had never used a camera that wasn't on his iPhone. Moreover, we had two different cameras (and two different brands with totally different formats). Peter flawlessly taught to both our skill levels and transitioned seamlessly between both cameras, both of which he was very familiar with. Peter formatted a custom day-long tour for us, so we were able to combine multiple areas of the peninsula that we wanted to see. Moreover, we were finishing our trip with a safari in the Kruger and Peter set up a tour of an animal sanctuary to make sure we learned the basics of photographing animals so that we'd get first class photos on that part of our trip. More photos to come as I get them all uploaded but attached are a few that we captured with Peter during our tour. I cannot recommend Peter enough. If you are visiting Cape Town a tour with him is a great addition to your trip (and do it early! you'll regret any of your photos taken before you do it!)."

            "review": "'Lekker' Tour ;-). My wife and I have just visited Cape Town to celebrate her 40th birthday with family living here. I wanted to give her a special birthday present that she would not forget. As her treat to herself, she bought a new Nikon DSLR camera. She a novice to this type of camera, and did not find the instruction manual very easy to understand. Despite the purchase of several magazines and books, she could still not get to grips with her new toy and was getting really frustrated with not being able to use the full potential of her camera. I chanced upon Peter's company on TripAdvisor. He had outstanding reviews and I decided to contact him several months ahead of our trip. Peter was extremely prompt with his reply and I went on to explain the situation. He was very helpful and offered very good advice. I then went ahead and booked a day tour which started with my wife and I being picked up before sunrise. We then headed out to catch the sunrise and the 'Golden Light'. Peter got my wife to work straight away and got her snapping pictures on the way there. He then went on to get her to use several different settings on her camera. She was almost instantly taking breath taking photos. He also went on to explain the theory and guidelines to photograph. After taking many photos around the location, we all had a well earned break at a local cafe. The food and staff were fantastic, and once we were all refuelled, Peter started to explain the various settings of the camera and how to use them. He also provided simple and easy to understand notes. We then headed out again, and by the end of the morning, my wife was shooting on manual! We then headed home to pick up our kids (7 & 10). The second part of the tour was supposed to be a visit to a township were we would have a traditional lunch, followed by a further lesson on portraits in the township. It was unseasonably hot that afternoon (30+) and by the time we arrived, we were all boiling. Nevertheless we had lunch a the local place selected by Peter. He knew the staff, and had a wonderful knowledge of what to order. We were not disappointed when the food arrived. It wonderfully cooked and very tasty. Due to the heat we decided to cut our afternoon short. Peter was very understanding of this and took us straight home. Despite having to cut our afternoon short, we had the most amazing time. My wife is now far more comfortable with her camera and has carried on taking amazing photos. Peter's notes are a wonderful aide-memoir and a reminder of a fantastic experience. I would not hesitate to recommend Peter to anyone, from novice to experienced photographer. He has a wealth of knowledge that ranges from photographic techniques to a love of his region. He knows where to go, who to speak to, and is very flexible. I am only sad that we did not have more time to spend with Peter. I would have loved to experience many of his other tours. I can only finish by saying that we will definitely be booking Peter again on our next visit, hopefully in the very near future. "

Right from the start, literally before we drove away from our hotel that he picked us up at, he was showing me tricks to do in the car to capture passing street lights with long exposures. We then watched the sunrise and Peter helped me work on technical settings with the camera and shot composition. He took some nice photos of my wife and I in front of the colorful beach huts and provided more assistance to me as well. After, we had a nice breakfast and he reviewed some more instructional material with me before heading out to Kalk Bay to shoot the harbor and work on shot composition. He offered my wife to go shopping along the beachfront stores if she wanted, and she was very excited to leave me to the camera for a while, so she could also explore the quaint but funky area. Then we headed to Boulders Beach where Peter took us to a lesser known area so we could actually get up close to the Penguins. It was incredible! All throughout our tour, Peter helped with my camera and provided feedback and assistance, but he was also very much a guide and told us about where we were, interesting facts and history and stories. He is such a friendly and charismatic individual- and he really knows his photography! During the ride home, we rode along the peninsula and stopped at a few lookout points for more scenic photos. We couldn't say more great things about the experience we had with Peter. Even though my wife isn't into photography, she enjoyed the day as much as I did. My goal for this tour was to focus on camera settings (aperture and shutter speed, etc.) as well as shot composition, and I became better at both. I definitely walked away from the tour a better photographer!"

We had the absolute experience of a lifetime alongside Peter who is a hugely passionate and incredibly skilled photographic tour guide.

Peter knew all about the history of the area and we started with a quick pit stop photo shoot on a children's merry-go-round, where he provided us an effortless instruction on panning (my father & wife are the photographers in our group) which was fantastic. We then visited a number of areas of a township; including a museum, information centre, shebeen (drinking den) and a number of shack residences. We hoped to educate our children in different cultures and ways of life and quite simply we weren't disappointed and it was a humbling experience for all who attended. Peter was attentive and genuinely interested in our groups photographic shots including a great contrasting shot of some large grafitti. We finished with one of the more touristy stops (Msoli's butchers & BBQ) which again was a great experience. At all times we felt at ease, safe and secure in our guides clear knowledge and love for his country.

            "review": "The Most Amazing Photographic Experience. Wow! I was lucky enough to enjoy yesterday a very long day with Peter which was effectively two private one on one half day tours - the Cape Town City and the Township - rolled into one . I had high expectations because of other reviews on here but even they were exceeded. This was quite simply an amazing experience, the most memorable of my 10 day holiday to Cape Town and without doubt the most remarkable photographic adventure of my life. Peter's email communication in advance of the day was prompt and comprehensive so from the outset he had a fair idea of my level of skill and experience and the equipment I would be bringing with me. He bent over backwards to be flexible and meet my specific interests and development needs.The day itself was essentially like a long private tuition class from a friend in remarkable surroundings. Not a moment was wasted. As soon as he collected me from my hotel at an unearthly hour to catch the sunrise (the early start is optional!) we were working on light trails from inside the car as we drove to the beach for our first shoot. The City photo tour in the morning was excellent. Standing on a deserted beach as the sun rose photographing across the sea to Table Mountain (the classic shot used by Trip Advisor as its Cape Town signature photo) practising slow shutter speed work was an experience in itself. Later we photographed fantastic street art in a grungy and atmospheric part of town and the picture postcard perfect colours of the Bo Kaap district. Tuition didn't stop even over breakfast in a cafe as Peter talked me through camera settings I wasn't familiar with and answered my technical queries.This was good, very good. But the afternoon visit to a Township was even better. After lunch in a township restaurant, which was an experience in itself, Peter took me into a neighbouring community where we spent several hours shooting portraits of locals both in their homes and around the streets of the township. We visited the dark and mysterious hut of a traditional spirit doctor, a local drinking place, were given access to people's desperately sad and poverty stricken shacks to photograph them in their own homes, took portraits of children playing in the streets, visited an outdoor butchery (I'm squeamish and was initially dubious about this aspect but it turned out to be another tremendous experience) and finished the day spinning around a roundabout in a childrens play area practising panning shots with dozens of local children for company!The only reason that all of this was possible in the township was because Peter has clearly put a lot of effort into cultivating good relations with the local community. He made it so easy for me, delivering a constant stream of willing subjects which allowed even somebody like me to take some utterly memorable and compelling pictures which I will be proud of for the rest of my days. All I had to do was follow him and take photos. He did the rest. Many of the locals were astonishingly willing - even keen - to pose for us and the results are stunning. At no stage was there any hint of personal risk. It was a privilege to be granted such access to places that few foreign tourists visit and incredibly humbling to see people's stoicism and friendliness in the face of such poverty. No visit to Cape Town is complete without stepping outside the tourist bubble and seeing a Township because of the broader perspective and understanding of the city it gives you.The day wasn't cheap even allowing for the currently very favourable exchange rates but I don't begrudge a penny of it (if you do the township tour you get a very appropriate, but optional, opportunity to make a donation to the local creche as a gesture of thanks to the community). Intensive tuition, good company, snippets of local history, access to amazing locations and people and memorable photographs. Perfect."

It was a brilliant day.My husband and I presented quite a challenge for a photography lesson, because my husband is somewhat experienced and I only take happy snaps with my Iphone. But, I was curious to learn what the \"P\", \"AV\", \"TV\" and M buttons on the real camera did. Peter, who owned a camera shop in his former life, patiently explained how to use each of the functions on the camera, as well as basic concepts such as shutter speed, ISO and aperture. However, Peter cleverly teaches you in context and whilst you are having the time of your life with him.The day began at 4,45 am (a little earlier than I would normally start a vacation day). But, we needed to catch the golden light. On the drive to a beach with a view of Table Mountain, Peter put my husband in the front seat with a tripod between his eyes to take photos with a slow shutter speed of the highway lights--wow, they were gorgeous. We then all set up on the beach with tripods to learn about catching the water falling with different shutter speeds and filters. Next, we did dunes and landscapes to learn about the aperture settings. Crazy fun. Over breakfast, Peter became teacher and explained the \"mechanics\" of what we had just learned.After breakfast, Peter took us to Woodstock--a neighbourhood where we never would have ventured alone to photograph flying birds and grafitti art. Amazing fun. By then we were ready for the \"P\" and \"M\" buttons.I highly recommend a day with Peter. We learned so much and had so much fun. Truly, our day with Peter is a highlight of our vacation. Loved it."

Peter is passionate about photography, and he has a very interesting facts and knowledgable about South Africa and Cape Town. I had an individual one-to-one photography tution with him. I have been using a Point and Shoot camera for a while, but had a strong desire to understand and use the Manual settings on my camera. I also also wanted to improve my composition. He tailored the course to suit my individual needs. Perfect!!!I learned heaps and was finally able to take some good photo's with my Canon EOS 60D. I also gained confidence behind my camera. Thank you Peter for the very useful and interesting photo course in Cape Town."

I am an experienced photographer and when I had the opportunity to visit Capetown was to visit a Township to see a first hand glimpse of what life is like for so many people. Security was paramount as I know there are dangers and I felt very secure and comfortable in the area we were. Peter did an outstanding job in taking me to the areas that I was interested in and left me to my job whilst watching my back as I concentrated on obtaining the images I had traveled for. This trip is gritty and hard hitting, you will be taken to places that you would never see without Peter's knowledge. It isn't pretty but it is much more rewarding because the images are strong and very thought provoking Well done Peter, I had a wonderful day with you."

He managed to organise the timing & route to meet our sightseeing objectives within sensible timings for the day. He has the ability to recognise people's interests and adjust the itinerary to meet while stopping at places that are photogenic.He has a knack of being able to find unusual sights which turn an ordinary day into something special.Very knowledgeable & not just about photography and always willing to help.Our day with him started with collecting us in Cape Town and taking us first to Stellenbosch (Oom Samie Se Winkel, Die Braak, St Mary\u2019s Anglican Church and the VOC Kruithuis). From here he took us to Boschendal Manor House where he got us into the Manor House (not normally open to the public) for a private viewing organised the Wine tasting (with extra tastings) & a walk around the gardens. From Boschendal we went to Fairview where unexpectedly we managed to get a Cheese & Wine Pairings Tasting. More easily organised was the visit next to the Afrikaans Language Monument near Paarl. The route from here to Butterfly World was interesting as he took us (as requested) along the N1 through the Huguenot Tunnel before turning back to re-cross the Huguenot Range via the R101 (Du Toitskloof Pass) to a viewpoint overlooking Paarl to Stellenbosch. The final visit was to Drakenstein Lion Park where we arrived about 15 minutes before feeding time.Overall a great day thanks to Peter"

Culturally, Peter's knowledge of the people (both individuals and the overall culture) provided a great insight into the lives of these poverty-saturated, but generally happy, people. Photographically, Peter had some ideas, models and locations that made for some PHENOMENAL captures. And finally, in what could easily have been a dangerous location, Peter seemed to maintain a good awareness and sense of control over the situations, however they developed. I never felt myself to be at risk.I would heartily recommend this tour."

Every year when I am in Cape Town, I spend time with Cape Photographic Company; I know I'll go away with increased awareness of my camera and how to take better (and better) pictures. This year, I did two things with Peter, a Township Tour with family, and an intensive and very rewarding LightRoom tutorial. For 4 hours Peter carefully and clearly, as always, outlined the steps for using the post-processing software, LightRoom, to enhance even the best photographs and certainly, to rescue the worst. I came away with an amazing amount of information which I have been using ever since. Peter generously offered to be at my beck and call for any questions, but he must have known that he was safe because he had explained things so well. I've never needed to call him.We also went on a Township Tour when family was in town. I had been on the Township Tour several times before, and each time was a different and unique experience, one I wanted to share with family. Peter knows the communities he visits and has formed relationships based on trust and respect. At Gugu s'Thebe, the art and cultural center, we were included in an impromptu drumming session and as always, ended with lunch at Mzoli's. A fantastic day.Peter can teach you something and show you something whether you're an experienced photographer or someone using an iPhone."

We booked this full day photographic tour months before our visit to Cape Town as it provided something the other companies didn't ... not just great sightseeing opportunities but also a great chance to learn more about photography. And it didn't disappoint thanks to our incredible guide and professional photographer, Peter. I just purchased my first DSLR camera a week or two before the trip and had absolutely zero knowledge on how to use it. Peter was patient and thorough in teaching me, not just all the various functions of my camera, but also about composition and exposure. Each new location visited on the day tour provided a new opportunity to learn something else about photography and also about Cape Town and its surrounds. To my surprise, I was experimenting with manual photography by day's end. Peter also provided handy instructional sheets so I can review what I've learnt and continue to improve.On a personal note, I want to thank Peter for such an incredible day. We thoroughly enjoyed his company, his friendly approachable disposition meant that ultimately we felt we were just spending the day out with a friend. The benefits of the day will impact on my photography long into the future, and I'm grateful that such a great day will have such a lasting impression."

We, as I had booked it for two, immediately received an email from Peter asking us what we wanted to see on the tour. Further emails followed right up until the day he met us promptly at 6 am.The first lesson started in the car on our journey to St James Beach to try and photograph the sunrise. Sadly, the clouds didn't cooperate but we still managed to learn about long exposures and captured some great images. We covered a lot of information during the day, but at no time did it seem like too much too quickly. Peter took time to answer questions, find out what we like to photograph, and shared some stories with us. He was more than just a teacher. By the end of the day it felt like 3 old friends out taking pictures; all getting excited when one would take a great photo.I highly recommend this tour to anyone interested in bettering themselves in photography; and also learning about the history of the Cape as well. Peter is a fountain of information about the region, and his excitement and love of his home country is infectious.I cannot thank Peter enough for the day that we had. Ultimately, the great photos I took were an afterthought.Geraint"

Not only was Peter extremely knowledgeable with all the sites to see, his comfortable, friendly and humorous manner made it so easy to learn how to take better photos.  Before we landed in Cape Town, we had e-mailed back and forth with Peter about what we wanted to see and exchanged some personal information, so when we finally met, we already felt like we had a friend in Cape Town. I shared with him my passion with taking photos of dogs and cats at my local animal shelters and rescues. Good photos of the animals help in finding them a new home and family. Using this info, Peter surprised me by stopping by Tears, a local animal rescue by his home. It was fun and informative to visit a rescue in another country. I was impressed with the facility and staff. I was also impressed with Peter who went beyond the tour guide/photographer role and found a way to give a personal touch to the day.We are coming back to Cape Town in a few months and the first thing we did after getting our flights booked was to contact Peter. He was a highlight on our first visit and we look forward to seeing and touring with him again.

He took us to some of the most beautiful places on earth and got us there before the tourists arrived, with each stop having a specific teaching theme. As a group we have a range of experience from DSLR regulars to phone camera users, and he provided both the appropriate level of just-in-time instruction to each of us as well as constructive and practical feedback on our efforts. He taught with great patience and good humor, and helped us get really spectacular photos. When Peter suggests a 5 a.m. start to catch the sunrise at St. James, don't hesitate to agree! We highly, highly recommend him: book in advance for the best day of your trip to the Western Cape!"

Second he listened and he adapted to what he heard (he found Sugarbirds & Sunbirds to photo) after a brief mention about sightings elsewhere. Third he was known in a number of places and this enhanced to the visits. But perhaps most important was he was good company & easy to get along with."

This was my second class with Peter. My first was a one-on-one class to get to know my new camera. By booking a class with the Cape Photographic Company, you can be assured that you will not only learn how to handle your camera and take better pictures, but you will also learn something about the area and the people staying in the area.

Peter told us interesting stories about sights along the way from Simon's Town to Bo-Kaap and then walked around with us amongst the quaint colourful houses, until it was time for our Cooking Course! This was done by one of the local residents in her own kitchen, and we learnt to make traditional Cape Malay curry, rotis, samoosas and more - making these ourselves and sitting down to have this feast for lunch when it was all done. Delicious!!! We then had the opportunity to buy our own spices at the local spice market which was an enriching experience in itself. I can highly recommend this tour to locals and visitors alike.

Not only to learn more things but also because those people usually know a lot about photgenic places and the right time of the day you have to be there.Brousing the Internet, I found Cape Photgraphic Company and Peter and he is just top notch. It was wintertime in Cape Town and rainy, but my only chance to go on that day. He could have cancelled the tour due to bad weather but he went out with me first to Langa and we even did the shipwrecktour, where we got quite wet. It is fantastic to see how the people in Langa like to see him which makes it easy to take photos. Most of them like to be willing models either becaue they know him or because of the way he handles people.The shipwreck tour was more of a challenge as we had to cross a small river and on our tour back, it started to rain again. Whenever you are in Capetown, I would highly recommend to book a tour with Peter. It might even be worth it, if you are only interested in some good snapshots. He is able to make photographie understandable for everyone and he knows all the good spots to take perfect pictures.On my next trip to Cape Town a tour with him will be on top of my list."

He quickly assessed our skill and knowledge levels and then worked with each of us on enhancing those in an easy to understand and helpful fashion.

I have done numerous workshops and courses with Peter and find his teaching style interactive, informative and exciting. Peter ensures that the workshops are structured for beginners and intermediate photographers,so that all benifit. Peter is passionate and loves what he does. Each time I have come away with practical knowledge that I can put into action immediatelly. I Love the setting of his home studio & teaching facility, set in the beautiful South."

As always, the workshops are an amazing opportunity to learn from someone who is passionate about what he does, is eager to share the knowledge, and imparts this in a nice and relaxed manner ... happy days indeed! I will be signing up for more workshops in the future."

Chose Cape Photographic Company and I am very happy with that. I wanted to do a lot more, but had only time for the Full Peninsula tour and half day Langa township. I really enjoyed this! In general Peter is a very nice guy to tolk with and he is a licensed guide. He knows both his history and how to take professional photos. He picked me up at my guesthouse excatly on time. I am a single traveler, but that was of no problem for him. Day 1 started at Muizenberg where we stopped at the beach, then the Penguin colony were we went to the 'normal' spot, but also to the other side were we got closer to the penguins. I also got nice tips on how to get better photos of the penguins. Later Cape Point and we walked to the top and as far south as we came. I was also able to walk from Cape Point to Cape of Good Hope while Peter took the car. We ended with the Chapman's peak drive. Day 2 was the Langa Township tour and portrait photos. He knows the people there and respects them. They also respect him. Firstly went inside a Shebeen to taste the local brew. A fun experience. Also got to take a lot of photos of the people inside. They were really photogenic! When we were inside a lot of children noticed the car and they started poping-up. Went for a walk around the area and to pictures of the children and bought some candy for them. Also learnt much more about flash photography. A quick stop at a traditional doctor before we had lunch at Mzoli's which tasted terrific!"

I have since completed 2 courses with him, and these have by far and away been the best that I have ever attended. He makes it all so simple, and is able to deal with more and less experienced students with the same patience and simple explanations that help to demystify some of the technicalities of photography, and now photoshop (my last course). I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him, and look forward to more courses, as well as some workshops in the future with him.

Being a mom I am passionate about taking photos of my family growing up - I felt I needed more help with my photos and decided to attend Peters course \"taking better photos\". It's the best thing I have done in a long time. Not only is he very down to earth and interesting, but he is totally committed to any form of \"painting with light\". His knowledge and passion encourages u to want to go out there and take the most amazing photos, he guides you in every situation that u could possibly find yourself in, he speaks to the very basic beginners and most advanced people all in one sentance. He tells you how and why your camera functions the way it does regardless of the make. He is the best mentor a person could have and he is always willing and eager to assist, no matter how long it takes or how many times he needs to explain the same thing, he just comes in from another angle and the piece of the missing puzzel falls into place. I would highly recommed Peter to anyone who would like to take a better photo, who would like to understand how their new or old camera works, or to go on one of his day outings, or use his studio (which I have done and I was so happy with the results) or just to find out which flash light or lense to invest in (I have done both and am very happy with both items)Thanks for your time Peter, you have helped me in more ways than you will ever know."

I really enjoyed his 'no pressure' style of teaching and understanding that each person in the class could have different ambitions for their photography. The course really was well worth the drive out to Noordhoek each week and was much more reasonably priced than other schools I investigated. It is also a great comfort to know that Peter is so willing to help and share his experience even after the course is finished should students ever be stuck!

Peter was a wonderful guide, teacher and host. He was very encouraging regarding my photography, with lots of advice and tips. Although I was shooting with Olympus, as opposed to Canon or Nikon, Peter knew how to get the camera to perform optimally, and I've come home with some great photos. However, it wasn't just the photos that had these two days special. Peter knows more than cameras. He is a qualified tour guide, and knows the history of the areas, and is also up on the geography and the wildlife. But it was his relationships with the communities we visited which made the trip very special. The Township tour gave me a perspective on the people of Cape Town, and indeed the history of South Africa, which I think few people get first hand. I didn't feel like I was intruding, rather I felt welcomed into an area where few visitors venture apart from in the safety of a tour bus. The community in Langa knows Peter, and it felt that there was a mutual respect. And the children took enormous delight in viewing pictures of themselves on the camera screen. If only I'd had another person with me to capture those moments! I was travelling alone. It is sometimes very hard to find a tour company that will accommodate a solo traveller, and particulary charge oppressive rates for an individual. Peter was willing to guide me alone for two days at a fair price, more expensive than if I'd had two or more people with me, but I was getting a personalised service, so the rate was appropriate. Peter was also great company. I'd recommend Cape Photographic Company highly. Thanks again."

Peter is incredibly professional, patient and accommodating he helped us with preparing ourselves before the shoot and was very good with my little niece who was a bit grumpy having just woken up.

We first started with Bokaap (which you could spend all day photographing) where we chatted with the locals as well. Then on to the district 6 museum to understand the history behind the area and significance of the Cape Flats. The highlight for me was interacting with the locals (that Peter has clearly spent much time with and respects) who would wave wherever we went. As a very keen photographer, Peter was able to help with organising people for portraits, and hear a little of their stories. Peter was also very happy to answer my many questions and did not hurry me up, when I just wanted to get that one more photo! A great day and will go again if ever I am back in Cape Town.

Not only due to her extensive knowledge on the area, but also her vast local connections and interest in the passengers' experiences and knowledge. I don't think anyone could not have a good time with guides showing this much passion and enthusiasm for what they do.Amazing scenery and experiences, with the flexibility to cater to groups of different age dynamics. Great South African food also prepared for us by our guide, as well as sampling some of the local delights.Thanks again to Ziggy and Lucky and Lost Tours, couldn't have asked for a better day on the Cape!"

The weather that day was not good , heavy rain , but Ziggy brightened up the day with her love for Cape Town that shone through the rain. Very informative, as being a local, she understands much about the culture and heritage of the place . The pace of the tour was adjusted to make the most of the weather , she took advantage of local connections to work out the best places to visit that day . Great commentary , and music, throughout the trip and after one day we had such an insight to the delights of Cape Town and the Natutionl Park . Highly recommended ."

Ziggy is super knowledgeable about the entire region -- history, nature, people -- and also very friendly. My group was pretty small, but I can imagine Ziggy would make it very easy for solo travelers to have a great time with everyone else on the tour. Other tours have you do a small amount of cycling at the Cape, but Ziggy -- very thoughtfully -- skips this to allow you to take one of the most beautiful hour-long walks I've ever experienced from the lighthouse to another gorgeous viewpoint -- absolutely spectacular! Of course, I enjoyed the stunning scenery, the delicious (and healthy) lunch, and the winery stop, but it was also a pleasure just to spend the afternoon with Ziggy and talk to her about South Africa and her travels around the world. Our day together was one of the highlights of my time in Cape Town and, really, all of South Africa."

Nachdem wir Kapstadt und Umgebung von unserer ebenso charmanten wie professionellen Begleiterin Pascale gezeigt bekamen, befuhren wir mit Manfred im klimatisierten Kleinbus rund 10 Tage lang die Garden Route, besuchten Knysna, machten Safari im Addo Park, sahen Montagu, Plettenberg Bay, Hermanus und viele andere wunderbare Pl\u00e4tze. Zahlreiche Stopps an Orten, an denen wir sicher vorbei gefahren w\u00e4ren, der Besuch des Robertson Weinfestivals und viele andere Tipps und Empfehlungen haben die Reise zu einem echten Erlebnis gemacht.

Er begleitete uns die folgenden zwei Wochen durch S\u00fcdafrika. Von Stellenbosch an die Garden Route \u00fcber Somerset West auf den Sir Lowry`s Pass. Den Ausblick auf die False Bay noch vor Augen weiter nach Knysna, durch den Addo Elephant National Park und abends bei Sonnenuntergang nach einer kleinen Bootsfahrt mit Boards die D\u00fcnen herunter. Als ich zu Beginn all diese Programmpunkte nacheinander durchlas, \u00e4hnelte das Ganze einem herrlichen Reisef\u00fchrer, fast schon einer fiktiven Geschichte. Aber all das real erleben zu d\u00fcrfen war wunderbar. Wynand hat uns an die weniger touristischen Orte gef\u00fchrt, fernab von Kamerablitzen und Reisebussen, er hat mit uns sein Wissen geteilt, nicht nur \u00fcber S\u00fcdafrika als Land, sondern auch \u00fcber die Kultur und die Menschen. Wir haben sehr nette, pers\u00f6nliche und anregende Gespr\u00e4che gef\u00fchrt und der s\u00fcdafrikanische K\u00e4fer, der einen bei\u00dft und nie wieder so richtig los l\u00e4sst, hat bei uns auf jeden Fall angebissen.Die zwei Tage, die wir, wieder zur\u00fcck in Kapstadt, zur freien Verf\u00fcgung hatten, waren f\u00fcr uns vollkommen ausreichend, und im Nachhinein h\u00e4tten wir definitiv mehr gesehen, h\u00e4tten wir diese Zeit mit Wynand verbracht.Besonders r\u00fchrend und beeindruckend war auch der Besuch in der Vorschule und im Kinderheim bei Amelia. Dieses Projekt unterst\u00fctzen Maria und Manfred Engelmann tatkr\u00e4ftig. Die Kinder haben f\u00fcr uns ein Lied gesungen und sich unheimlich gefreut, dass wir dort waren. Es war sehr bewegend und abgesehen von wundersch\u00f6nen Sonnenunterg\u00e4ngen, wilden Tieren und sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcstenstra\u00dfen bleiben auch solche Augenblicke f\u00fcr immer in Erinnerung. Es war die absolut richtige Entscheidung unsere Reise \u00fcber Kapstadt Exclusive Tours zu buchen und mit Wynand als Guide haben wir das goldene Los gezogen \u2013 das beste Geschenk was ich je bekommen habe und der mit Abstand sch\u00f6nste Urlaub \u2013wir kommen wieder!"

Zun\u00e4chst hatten wir nur Fl\u00fcge gebucht und \u00fcberlegt, alles selbst zu organisieren. Auf Grund der K\u00fcrze der Zeit, von nur 10 N\u00e4chten vor Ort, haben wir uns anders entschieden. Aus heutiger Sicht, die beste Entscheidung \u00fcberhaupt!!!Warum?Wir k\u00f6nnen uns nur den vielen \u00fcberaus positiven Bewertungen zu 100 % anschlie\u00dfen. Vom ersten Emailkontakt an war alles absolut perfekt \u2013 zuverl\u00e4ssig und vor allem sehr, sehr herzlich. Es mag sich vielleicht merkw\u00fcrdig anh\u00f6ren, aber irgendwie f\u00fchlte es sich nie fremd sondern gleich sehr vertraut an, so als w\u00fcrdest du mit \u201elieben Freunden\u201c schreiben. Diese Herzlichkeit haben wir zudem, fast \u00fcberall in S\u00fcdafrika erleben d\u00fcrfen. Wir waren 6 Tage mit Wynand unterwegs (Stellenbosch Weingebiete mit Franschhoek Pass, \u00fcber Betty\u00b4s Bay nach Hermanus, Safari Inverdoorn, Kap der guten Hoffnung mit Fahrt \u00fcber den Chapmans Peak, Amelia`s Kinderheim im Township Mfuleni, Kapstadt ganz \u201espeziell nur f\u00fcr uns\u201c, Bloubergstrand und vielen weiteren Highlights). Anschlie\u00dfend hatten wir noch 3 Tage Kapstadt zum Selbsterkunden.Was sollen wir sagen...schon als wir geh\u00f6rt haben, dass wir mit Wynand auf Tour gehen, haben wir uns sehr gefreut und das ausschlie\u00dflich, auf Grund der vielen positiven Beschreibungen \u00fcber ihn.Alles, wirklich alles war einfach nur gro\u00dfartig, informativ, innovativ, pers\u00f6nlich, f\u00fcrsorglich...wir hatten so unglaublich viel Spa\u00df mit Wynand und er wohl auch mit uns :0)F\u00fcr uns w\u00e4re es zuvor nie denkbar gewesen, eine gef\u00fchrte Tour zu buchen. Zu konservativ und elit\u00e4r erschien uns diese Form zu reisen. Im Nachhinein k\u00f6nnen wir nur sagen \u201cDANKE\u201c das wir diese Erfahrung machen durften. Die Reise war jeden einzelnen Cent wert.Diese Vielfalt, die wir dank Wynand in S\u00fcdafrika erleben durften, h\u00e4tten wir nie und nimmer erlebt, wenn wir es selbst organisiert h\u00e4tten...sei es an landschaftlichen Eindr\u00fccken, ausgefallenen Cafes, super Restauranttipps, so herzlichen Menschen und manchmal auch nur Stimmung einfangen.\u00dcberhaupt hatten wir den Eindruck, dass Wynand kein Standardprogramm abspult, sondern \u201eUNS\u201c S\u00fcdafrika ganz pers\u00f6nlich n\u00e4her bringt. Nach 6 Tagen endete unsere gemeinsame Zeit mit Wynand. Das f\u00fchlte sich f\u00fcr uns schon ein wenig nach Abschied von S\u00fcdafrika an. Aber auch f\u00fcr die verbleibenden Tage, hatte uns Wynand noch mit vielen tollen, individuellen, ma\u00dfgeschneiderten Tipps versorgt. An dieser Stelle sagen wir noch einmal vielen lieben Dank an Maria, Manfred und Julika...und nat\u00fcrlich Wynand. Ohne DICH, h\u00e4tten wir nie und nimmer eine so phantastische, beeindruckende, lebendige, fr\u00f6hliche Zeit erleben d\u00fcrfen, von der wir heute immer noch tagt\u00e4glich erz\u00e4hlen und das obwohl wir schon seit 2 Wochen wieder in Deutschland sind.Diesmal holt uns der Alltag nicht so schnell wieder ein...!!!Ist das die Faszination von S\u00fcdafrika???"

Maria Engelmann machte uns einen Vorschlag, der uns \u00fcberzeugte, und so ging es mit Manfred Engelmann auf die Tour. Von Kapstadt f\u00fchrt unser Weg an die Garden Route zun\u00e4chst \u00fcber Gordons Bay auf den Sir Lowry\u2019s Pass. Danach \u00fcber Swellendam nach Mossel Bay zum Gondwana Game Reserve. Dort nahmen wir abends an einer gef\u00fchrten Safari teil und nach der \u00dcbernachtung im Gondwana Game Reserve auch noch an einer Morgensafari. Dann ging es weiter entlang der Garden Route nach Knysna, wo wir auf Leisure Isle in der Knysna-Lagune wohnten. Wir erkundeten Leisure Island und die \u201eKnysna Heads\u201c. Am dritten Tag unternahmen wir einen Tagesausflug zum Nature Valley und zum Tsitsikamma National Park, wo wir zur Storms River-H\u00e4ngebr\u00fccke wanderten. Dann zur\u00fcck nach Knysna. Am vierten Tag ging es von Knysna \u00fcber die Garden Route nach Brenton-On-Sea und weiter \u00fcber Wilderness und spektakul\u00e4re P\u00e4sse nach Oudtshoorn in die \u201eKleine Karoo\u201c. Wir besuchten noch den Swartberg Pass, bevor wir nahe Oudtshoorn \u00fcbernachteten. Am f\u00fcnften Tag fuhren wir \u00fcber die nicht nur durch Ronnie\u2018s Sex Shop ber\u00fchmte Route 62 von Oudtshoorn nach Montagu: eine Fahrt durch die Halbw\u00fcste der \u201eKleinen Karoo\u201c. Wir \u00fcbernachteten in Montagu, einer kleine Stadt mit besonderer Atmosph\u00e4re und interessanter kap-holl\u00e4ndischen und viktorianischen Architektur. Am letzten Tag ging es von Montagu durch das Robertson Weintal zum Flughafen in Kapstadt und zur\u00fcck in die Heimat.Es war fantastisch: die abwechslungsreiche und spektakul\u00e4re Natur, die Pflanzen- und Tierwelt, die Betreuung, die Unterk\u00fcnfte, die Mahlzeiten. Auch wenn nur sechs Tage m\u00f6glich waren, es waren tolle Tage. Danke Manfred und Maria Engelmann. Elke und Rolf Michel, Burgdorf"

Gefallen hat uns, dass Wynand nicht einfach das vorher festgelegte Programm abgearbeitet hat, sondern immer wieder unterwegs Erg\u00e4nzungen oder Alternativen vorgeschlagen hat. So hat das ganze einen wirklich einen sehr individuellen Charakter bekommen. Wir haben uns regelm\u00e4\u00dfig auf die Vorschl\u00e4ge eingelassen und es nie bereut.

Manfred hat es immer wieder geschafft, uns auch die Tage mit langen Fahrtanteilen kurzweilig zu gestalten, indem er Zwischenstopps an Punkten eingebaut hat, die wir ohne ihn und bei einer Reise auf eigene Faust sicherlich nicht angefahren h\u00e4tten!Abgerundet haben wir unsere Reise mit einem Aufenthalt von 4 Tagen in einem genialen Ferienhaus in Somerset West, ebenfalls vermittelt durch durch Maria und Manfred - Kompliment an die im Nebenhaus wohnenden Eigent\u00fcmer, deren gro\u00dfz\u00fcgige Lebensart an jeder Stelle sp\u00fcrbar war. Auch diese Tage konnten wir dank vieler Vorschl\u00e4ge von Manfred, z.B. der Empfehlung einiger Weing\u00fcter in der n\u00e4heren Umgebung, einem Bauernmarkt und vieles mehr erlebnisreich verbringen.Zusammenfassend gesagt, die Reise wurde mit viel Einf\u00fchlungsverm\u00f6gen und der Liebe zu S\u00fcdafrika f\u00fcr uns von Manfred und Maria organisiert und so zu einem unvergesslichen Erlebnis.Der Name \"Kapstadt Exclusive Tours\" h\u00e4lt, was er verspricht: Exklusive Touren mit \u00e4u\u00dferst kompetenten, gef\u00fchlvollen Reiseguides und pers\u00f6nlicher Betreuung!Herzlichen Dank an das gesamte Team - ganz sicher 5 Sterne!"

Bei der Suche im Internet sind wir auf \"Kapstadt Exclusive Tours\" gesto\u00dfen. Nach kurzer Email-Kontaktaufnahme mit Schilderung unserer Reisezeit und Absichten erhielten wir umgehend Vorschl\u00e4ge von Fam. Engelmann. Wir sollten mit einer 2-t\u00e4gigen Safari beginnen, w\u00fcrden dann von einem Tour Guide (im Mercedes) abgeholt werden und 4 Tage mit ihm die Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten auf der Garden Route mit 3 \u00dcbernachtungen (Knysna, Hermanus) erkunden. Den 31.12./01.01. in Kapstadt verbringen und anschl. noch 3 Tagesausfl\u00fcge mit Cape Winelands und Kap der guten Hoffnung unternehmen. Von Frau Engelmann wurden wir auch telefonisch kontaktiert und konnten noch W\u00fcnsche \u00e4u\u00dfern. Wir best\u00e4tigten dann die Reise und um alles weitere k\u00fcmmerte sich dann \"Kapstadt Exclusive Tours\". Als Fazit nun nach Abschluss unserer Reise k\u00f6nnen wir sagen, die gesamte Reise und der Aufenthalt in S\u00fcdafrika war eine Bereicherung f\u00fcr unser Leben.Die Organisation durch \"Kapstadt Exclusive Tours\" war super, insbesondere die f\u00fcr uns gebuchten Unterk\u00fcnfte d\u00fcrfen wirklich das Pr\u00e4dikat \"exklusiv\" tragen, was die Lage, Ausstattung und den Service betreffen. Ein dickes Lob f\u00fcr die Auswahl an die \"Engelmanns\" daf\u00fcr.Zu unserem pers\u00f6nlichen Tour Guide ist zu sagen ( wir wussten nicht was uns erwartet - bisher waren wir auf unseren Reisen immer \"Selbstfahrer\") - wir haben mit Wynand das gro\u00dfe Los gezogen!Schon nach dem ersten Tag hatten wir das Gef\u00fchl mit einem guten Bekannten unterwegs zu sein. Er hat uns \u00fcber das Land, die Gegend, die Menschen und das Leben der S\u00fcdafrikaner so viele Einblicke gegeben und interessante Stellen gezeigt - da kann kein schriftlicher Reisef\u00fchrer mithalten! Man hat gesp\u00fcrt, dass er selbst auch Freude hatte uns das Land zu zeigen. Wir konnten auch W\u00fcnsche \u00e4u\u00dfern - er hat alles m\u00f6glich gemacht diese in die Route einzubauen. Dickes Lob daf\u00fcr. Unsere zahlreich gesammelten und erhaltenen Souvenirs werden uns an diese Reise erinnern.Eine Anmerkung noch f\u00fcr Leute die in Kapstadt auch mal Silvester verbringen wollen:K\u00fcmmert euch rechtzeitig um eine Reservierung. Man hat keine Chance kurzfristig vor Ort noch etwas zu bekommen. Wir hatten dies leider vers\u00e4umt bzw. sind nicht darauf aufmerksam gemacht worden (ist der einzige klitzekleine Minuspunkt bei der Reisevorbereitung). Allerdings hat uns die von Fam. Engelmann gebuchte Unterkunft gerettet. Sie hatte eine Dachterrasse mit Strandkorb. Wir waren allein im Guesthouse und konnten mit Blick auf die Lichter von Kapstadt und das Feuerwerk der V+A Waterfront das neue Jahr begr\u00fc\u00dfen (Essen am nah gelegenen Markt zu bekommen war auch kein Problem). Es war im Endeffekt sogar sch\u00f6ner als im Trubel der V+A Waterfront zu stecken. Tags\u00fcber hatte man \u00fcbrigens auch vom Pool aus eine sch\u00f6ne Sicht auf den Tafelberg.W\u00fcrden wir noch einmal S\u00fcdafrika besuchen, sprechen wir mit Sicherheit \"Kapstadt Exclusive Tours\" f\u00fcr die Organisation an und w\u00fcrden uns auch unseren Tour Guide Wynand wieder w\u00fcnschen.

Das Kunstwerk wurde extra f\u00fcr uns von dem achtj\u00e4hrigen Sohn unseres wunderbaren Tour Guides Wynand gemalt - als Dankesch\u00f6n f\u00fcr S\u00fcssigkeiten, die wir aus der \"alten Heimat\" mitgebracht hatten. Nat\u00fcrlich sind solche Kunstwerke sogar bei Kapstadt Exclusive Tours nicht Standard, aber ich denke, es sagt doch viel dar\u00fcber aus, wie pers\u00f6nlich und individuell die Reisen sind, die man hier bekommt.Hier bekommt man wirklich ma\u00dfgeschneiderte Reisen. Engelmanns geben sich gro\u00dfe M\u00fche, alle W\u00fcnsche zu ber\u00fccksichtigen und den S\u00fcdafrika-Urlaub f\u00fcr jeden unvergesslich zu machen. In den zwei Wochen, die wir dort verbracht haben (Garden Route und Kapstadt) gab es nicht eine Kleinigkeit, von der ich denke, man h\u00e4tte sie besser organisieren k\u00f6nnen. Alles passte. Ich war alleine mit meinen beiden Kindern (14 und 16) angereist und hatte Maria Engelmann vorher gebeten, uns eine Reise zusammenzustellen, die die besonderen Bed\u00fcrfnisse und Interessen von Teenagern ber\u00fccksichtigt. Das hat sie perfekt gemacht! Unsere Unterk\u00fcnfte waren, jede auf ihre Weise, sehr, sehr charmant und liebevoll gef\u00fchrt, aber \u00fcberhaupt nicht \"\u00fcberkandidelt\", was mir hervorragend gefallen hat. Gerne h\u00e4tten wir \u00fcberall ein paar Tage dran geh\u00e4ngt, doch dazu war die Zeit (begrenzt durch die Schulferien) zu knapp. Die Touren und Safaris waren ebenfalls toll gew\u00e4hlt! Jeden Tag haben wir ein anderes S\u00fcdafrika kennen gelernt. Mit unserem Tour Guide Wynand hatten wir riesig viel Spa\u00df! Es war, als w\u00e4re man mit einem guten Freund unterwegs, und sp\u00e4testens beim Abschied hatten wir auch tats\u00e4chlich das Gef\u00fchl, einen guten Freund zur\u00fcckzulassen. Besser geht es nicht. Auch Familie Englmann haben wir gegen Ende unserer Reise kennen- und lieben lernen d\u00fcrfen. Und dabei gleich beschlossen, uns bei n\u00e4chster Gelegenheit einen Namibia-Trip von ihnen ma\u00dfschneidern zu lassen. Ohne Kapsatdt Exclusive Tours, da sind wir uns einig, h\u00e4tten wir aus diesen zwei Wochen nicht ann\u00e4hernd so viel \"rausgeholt\". Vielen, vielen Dank, Wynand und Familie Engelmann! Wir sehen uns wieder!"

Wir haben die Stadt besichtigt, das Kap besucht, Wale in Hermanus gesehen, fantastisch gegessen und einige Weing\u00fcter besucht. Besonders beeindruckend war f\u00fcr uns der Besuch bei Amelia und ihrem Kinderheim im Township. Hier haben wir das Projekt Help kennen gelernt und die andere Seite der Stadt gesehen. Mit Manfreds Ortkenntnis und Hilfsbereitschaft haben wir Namibia und S\u00fcdafrika besser kennen lernen k\u00f6nnen als es uns selber in der Zeit m\u00f6glich gewesen w\u00e4re. In den drei Wochen hat ein Highlight das n\u00e4chste gejagt, danke Manfred f\u00fcr die tadellose Organisation, den Enthusiasmus, die Tipps, Gespr\u00e4che und die lustigen Doppelkopfabende.

Dazu haben sicherlich die niederl\u00e4ndischen, deutschen, franz\u00f6sischen und britischen Einwanderer beigetragen, die sich ab Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts in S\u00fcdafrika ansiedelten.Premierministerin der Provinz Westkap ist Helen Zille, eine Gro\u00dfnichte des Berliner Millieu-Malers Heinrich Zille. \u00dcber 30.000 Deutsche wohnen dauerhaft in Kapstadt, wird gesch\u00e4tzt, denn eine Meldepflicht f\u00fcr Einwohner gibt es in S\u00fcdafrika nicht. Weitere 100.000 sollen hier ihren Zweitwohnsitz haben. So verwundert es nicht, dass man an vielen Ecken auf deutsche Gesch\u00e4fte trifft. Manfred, unser Guide, zeigte uns die sch\u00f6nsten Ecken von Kapstadt. Dank seiner Ortskenntnis haben wir sehr sch\u00f6ne Eindr\u00fccke mitgenommen.Bereits in Kapstadts Victoria & Alfred Waterfront begegnen wir der Royal Bavarian Bakery, die Brot und Brezeln nach bayerischem Standard anbietet. Auf dem Weg zur Tafelberg-Seilbahn befindet sich im Stadtteil Tamboerskloof auf der Kloofnek Road die B\u00e4ckerei \u201eDinkel\u201c mit einem netten kleinen Caf\u00e9. Das labberige s\u00fcdafrikanische Wei\u00dfbrot ist halt nicht jedermanns Geschmack und hier gibt es knusprige Backwaren deutscher Tradition. Passend zu den Backwaren gibt es in der deutschen Fleischerei Raith Gourmet im Garden Centre in der Mill Street bayrische Wei\u00dfwurst, Fleischwurst und Schnitzel. In Somerset West, einem etwas au\u00dferhalb Kapstadts gelegenen Ort, in dem ebenfalls zahlreiche Deutsche leben, befindet sich der German Supermarket Woermann & Brock. Die Wurzeln dieses deutschen Supermarkts reichen zur\u00fcck bis zu den Hamburger Reedern Adolph und Eduard Woermann (Woermann-Linie, Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie). Wir haben etwa eineinhalb Stunden gewartet, bis sich auch f\u00fcr uns die T\u00fcren der hier scherzhaft \u201eFondue-Topf\u201c genannten Gondel f\u00fcr die Seilbahnfahrt auf den majest\u00e4tischen Tafelberg \u00f6ffneten. Oben angekommen, erschlie\u00dft sich uns ein phantastischer Rundblick auf Kapstadt mit seiner Waterfront, den Lion\u2019s Head, den Signal Hill und die Berge der Zw\u00f6lf Apostel.Die viktorianischen H\u00e4user in der \u00fcber 300 Jahre alten Long Street holen mit ihren schmiedeeisernen Balkongel\u00e4ndern noch heute das Flair vergangener Tage in unsere Zeit her\u00fcber. Das an dieser ber\u00fchmten Stra\u00dfe gelegene \u201eGrand Daddy\u201c-Hotel hat eine besondere Attraktion f\u00fcr \u00dcbernachtungen zu bieten. Wer mit dem historischen Aufzug in die oberste Etage f\u00e4hrt, findet sich inmitten eines silbrig gl\u00e4nzenden Wohnwagenparks der luftfahrtinspirierten Airstream-Caravans wieder, die noch heute aus Aluminium handvernietet werden.Der strahlende Sonnenschein pr\u00e4sentiert uns die bunt angestrichenen H\u00e4user des im sp\u00e4ten 18. Jahrhundert entstandenen Kapmalayenviertels Bo-Kaap in ihrer ganzen Pracht. Einige Minarette sehen wir als Zeichen des islamischen Glaubens der heute etwa 2.000 Einwohner. An der Rose Street l\u00e4dt uns das Caf\u00e9 Haas zu einer kleinen Rast ein. Das Caf\u00e9 hat eine sch\u00f6ne k\u00fcnstlerische Atmosph\u00e4re und das ganze Angebot ist hausgemacht, vom Kaffee auf dem antiken Kaffeer\u00f6ster bis hin zu den Backwaren. Gr\u00f6\u00dfter Touristenmagnet ist nat\u00fcrlich die Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. Ein Spaziergang auf den Piers ist entspannend und es gibt zahlreiche gute Restaurants und Pubs, in denen man eine kleine Pause einlegen kann. Die zahlreichen Gesch\u00e4fte im riesigen Einkaufszentrum Victoria Wharf bieten das \u00fcbliche Sortiment zu \u201eTouristenpreisen\u201c an."

Wir bedanken uns bei Maria und Manfred Engelmann f\u00fcr die Planung unseres Aufenthaltes, die vielf\u00e4ltigen Vorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr Aktivit\u00e4ten, G\u00e4steh\u00e4user und die Betreuung vor Ort. Das Wetter war ziemlich konstant sonnig, ca. 24-25 Grad mittags, nachts k\u00fchl, also angenehm f\u00fcrs Schlafen. Am Rande von Kapstadt haben wir, mit Blick auf den Tafelberg, ein sehr sch\u00f6nes, komfortables G\u00e4stehaus, direkt am Strand gelegen, bewohnt und konnten von dort aus mit einem Mietwagen die Stadt erkunden. Dank Maria und Manfred haben wir nicht nur touristische Highlights gesehen, sondern auch M\u00e4rkte besucht, die Insider bevorzugen sowie Einsicht ins Leben und Wohnen in einem Township bekommen.Auf der 7 t\u00e4gigen Rundtour entlang der Gardenroute haben wir dank der vielf\u00e4ltigen Hinweise und Buchungen von Engelmanns innerhalb von nur einer Woche viel gesehen und herrlich gewohnt. Die \u00dcbernachtungen in eher charakteristischen und kleinen G\u00e4steh\u00e4usern, hat uns gerade wegen der Unterschiedlichkeit der Unterk\u00fcnfte super gut gefallen. Alle H\u00e4user boten freundlichste Versorgung, mit Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck, lokalen Infos und Unterst\u00fctzung auch bei sonstigen kleineren wie gr\u00f6\u00dferen touristischen Anliegen. Die Empfehlung f\u00fcr den Addo-Elephant-Nationalpark und die organisierte Tagestour durch den Schotia-Park vermittelten einen naturnahen Eindruck von der Tier- und Pflanzenwelt der Region, mit einem anderen Parkkonzept. Das Interesse der Ranger f\u00fcr die Natur und das Projekt lie\u00df den Funken der Begeisterung auch auf uns Touristen \u00fcberspringen und im Austausch wurden vielf\u00e4ltigste Fragen aufgeworfen und beantwortet. Der Besuch war das erh\u00f6hte Eintrittsgeld allemal Wert, der Tag, eine Empfehlung von Engelmanns, war einer der H\u00f6hepunkte der Rundreise. Die Abschlusstage mit dem Besuch in Prince Albert, einem Trip entlang der roten Berge und anschlie\u00dfend der Fahrt \u00fcber den Swartbergpass machte die Rundtour, wortw\u00f6rtlich, rund. Der Abschied fiel entsprechend eher schwer von diesem Land S\u00fcdafrika, das sich uns mit vielen freundlichen und warmherzigen Begegnungen sowie mit so vielen Sch\u00f6nheiten offenbart hatte. Die Reise konnte aber auch nur zu diesem gelungenen Erlebnis werden, weil Maria und Manfred in der Vorbereitung wie auch in der Durchf\u00fchrung uns zuverl\u00e4ssig mit ihren Hinweisen und ihrer Erfahrung und besonders auch ihrer F\u00e4higkeit, auf unsere W\u00fcnsche einzugehen, hilfsbereit und offen an der Seite gestanden haben.

Abschlie\u00dfend m\u00f6chten wir nicht unerw\u00e4hnt lassen, dass wir uns mit Maria \u00fcber ein soziales Projekt in den Townships informiert und dieses auf bewegende Art auch kennen lernen durften.

We have been on a Township Tour on Sunday Morning and also for a cycling tour through the township of Langa in Cape Town. Both Guides Gladstone and Thando gave us a lot of information about housing, everyday life, history and also the community projects such as Gugu S'Thebe in Langa which is a nice cultural experience to see the pottery project and as well the first place in Langa to have a real coffee shop experience for the local community. The unique experience with the people who live there and their authentic story as well as the entertaining guides made the tours very special! I can definitely recommend both tours because going to church in a township on a Sunday morning is more of a party - not like a boring uni lecture as in my home country Germany. :D On top of that you also get to try some nice African traditional food such as butternut pumpkin or maize meal as well as a nice time at the happy feet project for the kids' education in dancing and keeping their traditions alive!It was a pleasure :)"

He first showed us a pottery project which is situated in the visitors center and this was very nice, one of the men working there explained to us how the pottery is made and we could also watch a lady actually paint a mug. Buying something or giving a donation was appreciated but there was no pressure. Then we went outside and the walking tour started. The guide told us he would show us different parts of Langa, from the very poor to the wealthier ones. I liked the first stop the most, it was in the house of an older gentleman who told us a lot about how he built the shack he was living in by himself, from material he found, he was actually very creative and had some clever solutions under the circumstances. He was a very positive and upbeat person and nice to talk to. We proceeded to another accomodation where six families were living under very cramped conditions and our guide encouraged us to look around and take pictures and just walk into people's apartments which I am not too keen on doing. We went into one and chatted briefly with a lady but the other doors were closed and that was fine for me. Later we strolled through the neighborhood and the guide told us some more stuff, we came along properly built houses and other amenities in the community. What I liked about the tour is that, especially as it was only the two of us, nobody paid attention to us and there were no crowds of kids following us. Apparently there are a lot of tourists visiting Langa so residents are used to them doing the tours which takes away from the awkwardness. The guide was nice, if I could give him a little point of improvement it would be to keep his attention to the visitors the whole time, even when they are engaged with other people. It's not that much about safety but about feeling you are not a burden as you are really getting into people's private space during this tour, being a stranger. I know for him it feels different as he grew up there but I have reservations walking into the bedrooms of strangers. In general, I do recommend taking a township tour and I also recommend Vamos. I think two hours are just the right time frame for such a visit."

My bike was in terrible condition and was difficult to ride but I didn't want to waste more time getting a new one. Once we were on our way the tour was fairly good but the guide was clearly tired, the tour was rushed (finished 15 mins early after starting so late) and the guide laboured for too long on the tipping expectations on multiple occasions. Overall we were very disappointed in what should have been an experience."

Siviwe is such a nice guy, very personable and funny. He is also an excellent storyteller, bringing me close to tears as he talked through the history of the township in relation to apartheid. Our experience of the township itself was very positive too - it was eye-opening being shown the shacks but also inspiring seeing the art and crafts and hearing about the positive attitudes, the grasping of opportunities presented post-apartheid, the loyalty of people to their community, and the effort made to make crime uncool. We were fascinated to learn about the culture and traditions of the Xhosa people and to meet some of the locals. We were actually joined for most of the tour by a 12-year-old boy who clearly fancied himself as a tour guide in the making, and he did a great job! The tour ended with lunch at the famous Mzoli's butchery and braai restaurant in neighbouring township Gugulethu, which served up the tastiest meat I think we've ever had! All in all we had a fantastic experience, we thoroughly enjoyed meeting and getting to know Siviwe, and would suggest that a holiday to Cape Town is not complete without this tour."

The guide and co-owner of Vamos Tours, Siviwe Mbinda, picked us up promptly from our BnB in BoKaap in a vehicle that was clean and airconditioned. Siviwe is an excellent guide, and inspirational. With him in Langa we felt perfectly safe. We were introduced to the home of a local resident whose abode was made mainly with recycled materials and he'd constructed a lamp from a recycled blender and a light fixture from a hair dryer part. The ingenuity of his inventions and the pride he had in his home were very evident. We spent some time at a cultural center and watched a group of school-age dancers. We saw government-built townhouses with solar panels on the roofs. It was an honour being welcomed into a local church and singing alongside these people. The pastor preached on how to deal with anger in a constructive way. We had a delicious lunch in a beautiful bungalow with double car garage. After touring Langa, we had completely different eyes driving past townships for the rest of our trip. We understood that these places are diverse, and populated with intelligent hard-working people who are overcoming challenges most of us have never had to face. Of all the things we did during our three weeks in South Africa, this was one of the best, and I would highly recommend going with Vamos tours for a safe and inspirational experience."

I wanted them to get a different perspective on life. We did the tour on Sunday which meant that there were children everywhere and a real buzz about the community. The children loved coming up to our group as we walked through the township and just wanted to hold our hands or do high 5's. Everyone was so friendly and said hello as we passed by and in no way were we made to feel like intruders. People welcomed us in to their homes and looked genuinely happy to see us. One lady offered for my youngest daughter to sit with her on her bed and told us all about living in the hostel. She shares a very small room with 9 others and they consist of 3 different families, previously unknown to each other. This was a real eye opener for us all. Thando, our tour guide was excellent. He has first hand experience of the township as he lives there and so he was able to answer questions honestly and with integrity. There are many churches within the !anga township and our tour culminated in a short visit to one of them. It was a wonderful experience and we were welcomed with open arms. In brief, I would highly recommend this tour to anyone who has a genuine interest in learning more about the townships.

Seeing the conditions that still prevail more than 20 years after the end of apartheid was very tough for a couple of westerners like us. The tour underlined the cruelty of that era and just how far SA has to develop to ensure all can live in decent housing. But underneath the superficial, we also met strong people with uplifting and inspiring stories to tell: the father who lived in a corrugated iron, home-made shack whose daughter want to be a lawyer and who was living in a better part of the township so as not to be disturbed; and the family who had recently moved into a new house which they saw as a palace! As their daughter told us you can either be controlled by the situation you are in or take control. She definitely was taking control. Some of the stories we heard moved me to tears. Thank you Vamos and Gladstone and the people of Langa for an inspirational tour. One small comment to make the tour better: the day we went was VERY hot and we did a lot of walking, but Vamos did not provide water. By the end I was becoming a little dehydrated."

Sensitively and interestingly conducted by the tour company entrepreneur (who was brought up there during the apartheid era and still lives there) , it provides a fascinating snapshot of the social and economic changes that have happened post- apartheid in a South African city township - and of what still needs to be achieved. In spite of the still harsh and difficult conditions under which many of the township's residents live (no running water, little or no sanitation, constant risk of fire, etc), the overall feeling and message was one of hope.

            "review": "Both enjoyable and illuminating, the highlight of our stay in Cape Town. Before describing the township visit itself I want to emphatically stress that you should 100% do this trip. Many people feel uncomfortable with the idea of a township tour and have preconceptions of it being being 'voyeuristic' and 'poverty tourism'. This is not the case. Apartheid and forced resettlement are a part of S Africa's recent history and townships are a living legacy of those times. That is not to say that they are negative or depressive places (Langa township was brimming with entrepreneurs, artists and joyful people), but it important that anybody interested in the country's society and future meet the people who come from these places and understand their challenges, hopes and ambitions. Equally, it is crucial that people in the townships meet and learn about foreigners and whites as well. I honestly believe that initiatives like Siviwe's will help encourage further integration in S African society.Our guide Siviwe came and picked us up from our apartment and then drove us to the Township. During the car journey we spoke at length about his views on the townships and S Africa in general and he was quickly open with us and very engaging. On arriving at the township we visited their theatre, met local artists and learnt about the social classes that exist within the area and how the municipal government is helping build new houses. We were quickly joined by 2 two school kids (Siviwe's tourism assistants !) who talked to us about their families and school. They stayed with us for the rest of the trip and were great fun! We met with a local who showed us how he had built his house (impressive improvisation!), visited a church and pub (sampling the local beer), and learnt about about the local delicacy; boiled lambs head! Lucky for us we didn't have to indulge Siviwe as he then took us to what was perhaps our best meal in Cape Town; a braai at Mzoli's Place. Beef, lamb, sausages, it was all delicious. We then dropped the kids back home and Sivile took us back to our apartment. Siviwe is charismatic, warm and attentive guide. The township trip is illuminating, educational and most of all, fun. We will definitely be returning next time we're in Cape Town to have a beer with Siviwe and to see how the township has changed.10/10"

It felt weird to take pictures of people who have it tough. On the other hand, thanks to the tours you get a change to help those people. The money is reinvested in Langa + we also bought a little something from the culture centre were they train people in handcraft so that they would be able to provide for themselves. I wouldn't call the tour nice because of the theme but it was informative and if you visit South Africa you should also see 'the other side' of it."

First off I'd like to say how happy I am that I decided to visit Langa, and experience a whole different culture and environment from the glam of Camps Bay where I had been staying. My guide was Gladstone, he was very knowledgeable about Langa and its history, as he still lives in the township. He took us to the home he grew up in, which was very special. The children in the township are absolutely beautiful, seeing the smiles on their faces even though they have so little, really opens you're eyes up and makes you have a different perspective on life. I loved visiting the cultural centre and seeing all the arts and crafts the community are making, and the delevopments that are happening, Langa is really growing into a great community. The highlight of course was visiting the Happy Feet Youth Project. The children performed a few song and dances for us and it was very special. If you want to take gifts for the children you can, just let your guide know beforehand. Thanks again Gladstone for being a wonderful guide. I recommend anyone who visits CT to see this side of the city."

Our guide as excellent and we cycled through the township stopping at a various sites, visiting local businesses and houses. It was interest and our local guide was very knowledgable. The only thing I would say is it felt rushed at times particularly when getting the bikes at the start. I ended up with a very large bike which is struggled to get on and most of the tour had left before I was even on the bike which took some time. So there were times when I was left behind by a rather significant distance. More time to select the right bike and helmets would be beneficial. Other than that it was excellent. Thank you"

Siviwe cheerfully picked us up from the hotel in a great new vehicle and we had fun learning Xhosa language's clicks and noises while we drove. When we started walking in Langa, we got the desired up close and personal look at the neighborhood including an amazing sit-down with the locals in the local beer hut ritual. Although the more famous eatery for lunch was closed, we improvised with another local and a great brai. The kids enjoyed meeting Siviwe's young friends and Maleebo accompanied us throughout the day. We were also fortunate enough to witness the return from the wilderness of the boys becoming men. Overall, a great experience for all ages. You owe it to yourself to see all sides of South Africa."

I came to CapeTown 2 years ago and did a township tour with another company and it was a very good experience.As I didn't remember which company I booked last time, I decided to go with Vamos due to its very good reviews.For both of us it was a big disappointment.We first went to the arts & craft center, which is not my favourite thing to do but it is OK for me (this is just a question of taste).Then I was hopping to do a walking tour with the guide with insightful informations on the life here, and how it is changing.Instead we went to the Langa Museum where another guide explained us a part of the history.Now, I want to be clear: this was interesting, and the museum as well, but this is not what I expect from a township tour: basically we started the day with this stop (after the art center) and it was nearly the only historical information that was given to us, ans it was in the form of a big speech and a museum.After that, we started walking in the Langa township and we didn't feel so good about the experience: without any historical information or insights, it really felt like we were taken there to \"look\" at people and their lives and we were not given the chance to understand the situations.There is also a moment where Gladstone (our guide) showed us the inside of a room from a shared building and we didn't feel in our place, I felt that we were disturbing the people who lived there (which I understand) and I would prefer not to do this kind of things.Also we were walking in the township and nearly not given any informations while hanging around. We also met quite often some other township tours in the same places which felt a bit weird (it never happened when I did a tour 2 years ago).We then met Gladstone's family which was interesting and gave us the opportunity to see new homes.The final part of this trip was supposed to be a lunch in Mzolis which is a Braai in the Langa township. Now I booked this tour because I was really expecting to have this lunch in the township and get the chance to meet people.When we arrived, the restaurant was closed and all our guide said was: \"sorry it is closed, I couldn't know\". and then we drove in the township and came back home. This is very disappointing and unprofessional, especially as the lunch was included: we were not offered any other solutions like to eat in another place, and in the end any kind of refund. I think it is quite an expensive activity and you would have expected the guide to have a second solution in case this happens.So in the end we felt like this half day was exactly what we didn't want in a township tour: be like tourists who are just there for seeing a township and not getting the chance to understand the history or the situation, combined with the lunch cancelled because of a bad organization, we felt very disappointed, especially my girlfriend who never had the opportunity to do a township tour and was very looking forward to it and finished very disappointed."

From the moment we met Siviwe he touched emotions within all the family (ages 7 and 10) and was a great tour guide. We took a half day private tour. Half of the 3 - 4 hour trip is taken on foot as Siviwe took us through the township showing and talking us through his insight and knowledge of past and present life / classes and Govt re-housing programme in the largest CT township. He also adapted the tour for the kids and taught them the local dialect and 'clicking', which they continued to practice through the rest of the holiday! We felt safe with Siviwe who was well known and knowledgeable of a community where life is changing and in time improving for many but still there is inequality and socio-economic issues both within and outside the township but hope and respect are key elements of township life and for the residents. The highlight of the tour was 'Happy Feet' a project founded and partly funded by Vamos for under-privilege children who have a safe haven to be fed, clothed and participate in a dance programme, which they then performed a dance and drum show for us. At the end my 7 year old son (AJ) who does street-dance showed them some of his \"moves\" which the children tried to copy and a uniquely interesting bond was formed. When asked what my kids highlight of the 2 week holiday in SA was the top 2 is safari and \"Happy Feet\". Thank you Siviwe you have truly touched us and I recommend no one leaves CT without doing a Vamos township tour ..."

Not beautiful, but reality, and in my eyes a must for everyone who visits South Africa.

However, from the beginning Siviwe put us at ease with his friendly personable style and and sense of humour. Picked up from the Waterfront, we went straight to Langa, first port of call was to a shop where they were making pottery, all part of what the people are doing to bring skills and trades into their community. TIP: if your going to buy local items as presents, it's probably worth waiting till you get here.. It pretty much wiped out our 'presents list' Walking through the township was an experience in itself, people going around their normal lives, living in such Close quarters, and their conditions, which are so different to ours (European perspective) but it was clean, and they take a real pride in their communities. There are plenty of photo opportunities. We were shown where Siviwe grew up and how he lived, which was a fascinating insight to who he was, and his background. He had, with imagination and determination started the business... Just shows what can be achieved. Finally came to eat (a restaurant in which Jamie Oliver has been to) and the food was lovely, mostly meat and mash and spicy sauce at Mzoli's - really tasty meats from the Braai, giving you an opportunity to sit down and talk to your fellow travellers and tour guide. A humbling and worthwhile tour, showing the real progress and pride these people have and determination to make their lives better and a great insight into their world. Highly recommend it.

We chose to do a cycle tour through Langa and our tour guide was the lovely Thando. We started off at the visitor centre where we saw pottery being made and other crafts and then headed out on our bikes for a look round the different areas of the township. It was interesting to see that there are areas just like any other town where there is obviously good incomes and people still choose to live in the township. When we entered the poorer areas though and saw how so many people were living it was quite a shock to the system. I think its something everyone should see, and although I felt a little uncomfortable intruding on peoples lives and entering their homes, no-one actually made me feel this way and Thando was happy to answer all our questions. I think it was more than I was uncomfortable knowing that some people in the world have so much when some have to survive on so little that made me uncomfortable, not the place itself. Thando even showed us his own home which was nice for us to see as it enabled us to know more about him as a person and felt much more personal and meaningful.So please continue to support ventures like this and buy some of the goods on offer when you visit (we bought a lovely salt and pepper set), you wont be disappointed."

From the moment he collected us he tried to involve us by trying to speak their native tongue, gave a brief history of Langa and current economic and social issues they have. The tour we went on was a walking tour, we started off in the community centre that housed a pottery shop and art gallery. The walking tour is a tour primarily based on the different social classes they have. We started off on the lower class with a stop off at a Shebeen where they brewed Sorghum beer. We were shown the illegal trade in the community, importation of sheep heads and how it is prepared, to how the beer is brewed and fermented. From here we went to the middle class areas. He outlined the key differences from lower class areas. He brought us into his Aunts home (his home growing up)and showed a typical layout. Any issues they had growing up but just meeting the people in that area was a delight. For the upper class we just drove arround the area but typically it isn't much different from how we currently live. We stopped off at the Happy Feet Project and were shown where part of the money you paid for the tour was going. Finally for the finish we were brought to Mzoli's Meat for lunch in Gugulethu a different township. You select the meat you want and then it is cooked on the braai in front of you. It was the best food I've had in South Africa.Langa is a strange place from the outside it doesn't look much but the sense of pride they have about their town and beliefs instilled in them makes it a whole lot more. It does put your own life into perspective and hopefully it will make me a better person from it. Thanks for the tour Siviwe Mbinda and wish you the best in everything you do!"

As we walked through Langa with him our first impression was obviously of poverty but, as we saw more, we felt increasing respect for the sense of community and optimism there. We started to understand the huge challenges facing the people living with the aftermath of decades of neglect, but also the sense that things are improving at quite a pace. Gladstone also explained a lot about tribal customs and structures, and the impact of only allowing the men to move from the villages to the townships. He lives in Langa and we could sense his pride in the progress his community had achieved. We took the morning tour, which included a good lunch at Mzoli's which was an experience in itself.

We had heard about opportunities to visit Langa Township during our stay in Cape Town, so we asked our South African travel consultant, WWS, and they put us in touch with Vamos Tours. We feel fortunate that our tour was led by Siviwe, the (co-)owner and founder of Vamos Tours. At our request, he started by explaining some of the history of South Africa, going back to the 17th century. He gave us a brief overview of the political and racial tensions that preceded the apartheid policy, which was officially imposed beginning in 1948. We learned about the ANC and the \u201cFreedom Charter,\u201d and how the racial, political and economic circumstances have evolved since Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990. He showed us poor neighborhoods, but also areas of Langa that are definitely middle class. We walked past ramshackle homes and small businesses, into a courtyard filled with both freshly-washed laundry and garbage strewn everywhere. (There is really no place to take the garbage, and no money to pay to have it picked up.) We chatted with inhabitants of a multi-family housing unit, where each 15X18 foot room houses a 3-5 member family. We were welcomed by little children who happily thronged about us while other children, members of Siviwe\u2019s \u201cHappy Feet\u201d dance program, performed for us. Siviwe is a very intelligent, articulate and sincere young man who is proud of his community and its culture and eager to help visitors discover why. He told us how all the children are essentially raised by all the adults in their life \u2013 an uncle is also considered \u201cDad,\u201d and all older adults are respected \u201caunties\u201d and \u201cuncles.\u201d Siviwe repeated for us the five things children are taught that \u201cmake you wealthy on the inside:\u201d 1. Don\u2019t look down on someone who is struggling. 2. Don\u2019t envy someone who has made it. 3. Don\u2019t be racist. 4. Never let anger or hatred drive you and 5. Don\u2019t beg. Pretty powerful rules to live by. And we had the impression that the self-confident children we encountered had already absorbed these important principles. Thank you, Vamos Tours, thank you, Siviwe, for a well-run, informative-yet-fun tour. It was the highlight of our 5 days in Cape Town!"

Surely one of the most unexpected surprises on any trip to Cape Town would be the simple joys to be discovered in a township tour. Much like the favela tours in Rio de Janeiro, the Langa Township Tour run by the Vamos Company engendered an initial bit of hesitation on my part, but the avalanche of positive reviews on TripAdvisor made me soon realize that I would miss something special if I didn\u2019t book it. Indeed I would because the tour is not an unrelenting and leering look at a people living in squalor and despair. Yes, there is plenty of poverty, but more importantly, there is a strong sense of community pride. Our guide was a local resident named Gladstone who took my partner and me around in his minivan. The tour begins with vibrant murals on an extended stone wall and continues to Gugas'Thebe, a multi-purpose cultural center that features local artists and musicians displaying their talent.We found our way into Gladstone\u2019s old neighborhood where a fellow tour member picked up a big, see-through plastic bag filled with little bags of chips which brought out dozens of children in the rain. We walked through the maze of shantytown shacks, and while an occasional dead rat showed up in our path, we never felt a sense of dread no matter how spartan the conditions appeared to be. In fact, we were welcomed warmly into one shack where a young woman explained how she went to college and journeyed to San Francisco on a student exchange program. We ended up attending a Sunday church service at the Langa Christian Church where we were treated to a two-hour, roof-raising performance of gospel music and sermons. It honestly felt more like East Oakland than South Africa, but it was truly inspirational. Our tour ended with lunch at the home of a woman who rents out her bedrooms to backpackers. She served a spicy beef stew over rice that was quite delicious. The tour costs R 500 per person (or less than $50). This was a most worthwhile tour that I strongly recommend."

We were so glad that other reviewers shared that Vamos guides are terrific and the Langa Township visit is a must do! It focuses on the history the tribes the culture and also what they have that keeps them together - thier communitiy. They are proud people and more than welcoming to have you visit. This is not a tour that your supposed to go and look down upon them - but actually you copme out with a heartening experience that most things in the western world are materilaistic and actually most of their way of life is centred about communication and enjoyment of life.. You will meet a wide variety of people from entrepreneurs who demonstrate the true meaning of small businesses to family members and children enjoying life and caring for each other. They have a strong sense of who they are and they know that they are not the weathliest people in Cape Town and by no way am I discounting that the poverty is profound but the spirit of the people in this Township is AMAZING. If you choose this tour, then choose Vamos. The visit to the community was intimate and Siviwe, our wonderful \"Langa ambassador\" was passionate and ver knowledgable about life in Langa and South Africa. We saw local businesses, homes, a cultural center with a chance to buy art and craft from Africa that is 25% of the price than you will have at the airport and belive me - a lot better You are safe when you are with Vamos and Siviwe as he knows everbody in the Township and everybody knows him. Amazing day. We loved it."

Excellent braai and you get to see a bit of other townships.

What stands out to me the most from visiting Cape Town for the first time is doing a bike tour in the Langa township with Thando as our guide. While he led us through the community on bicycles, we realized that what was supposed to be a two hour tour extended into three hours, and we could have easily spent much more time there. We met Simon, a local artist with an array of handmade paintings, jewelry, journals, and other trinkets for sale, and by purchasing them, you know you are directly supporting the township. We did the tour on a Saturday; had we visited on a weekday, we may have seen the Happy Feet Youth Project. Thank you, Thando, for a truly memorable experience."

When I visit Cape Town again in the future, I will surely be returning to Langa and contacting Thando. The bike tour was a good choice for us (even though I hadn't ridden a bike in over 15+ years!), because you can definitely cover more ground. The only thing we wish we could have done differently was perhaps visiting during a weekday, when we might have visited a classroom and saw the Happy Feet Youth Project!"

How special it was to have someone that lived within the township take us around and explain the history and current challenges of the people that were within his community.

We booked Vamos on the power of their trip advisor rating and we were not disappointed. We were picked up by our guide Gladstone at our hotel in a comfortable modern 'minivan' before collecting another couple on our way to the township of Langa. I have to say it started a little slowly and initially I had my doubts but it was building a picture and setting the 'story' in some context. From beginning to end it was interesting, sad, uplifting and thought provoking. You'll get a chance to see and feel everything you imagine - be prepared to be moved! You'll be amazed by the positivity of people living in such difficult circumstances and the pride they show in their country, each other and everything they do.Thanks so much Gladstone, you're a gentleman and I look forward to seeing your home in 'Beverly Hills' one day! ;-)"

The driver and tour guide are the same person and is a local resident of the township. He taught us a few words in Xhosa on the way, and even sang a song in his native language. The tour itself includes a lot of walking and you feel quite safe when you are with a local guide. I tried the gospel tour which included a 10-15 minute stop at a local Baptist church. The energy there was amazing! People are singing and dancing. Tour eventually ends at a local house where they cook for you. Food was great and host was very hospitable. The township itself is strikingly different from Cape Town. You see how people live there, in what bad conditions... And you visit a few local houses. Overall, it was a great experience. Highly recommended."

For those who are not into reading lengthy reviews I will summarize this: Contact them and do this.If you would like to know more details: We contacted Vamos tours through e-mail and they were very helpful and friendly and we booked a private half-day tour on rather short notice. Siviwe picked us up from our B&B and we drove to Langa township in his van. On the way he already gave us some background information about the townships and their development in general. We then had a short look at the community center before we started our walk through the township. During our tour Siviwe explained us more about the daily lives of the residents and he answered all the questions we had. We went into a bar and a true micro-brewery where we met other people from the township who told us about their lives an customs. Also we were invited into the homes of some residents and met some of Siviwe's friends. When we asked for a stop to look closer at a certain street that was no problem and we were shown around kindly again. The tour ended with a visit of the youth project Siviwe and the other guides run in the township where we had the chance to watch a dance invented, studied and performed by the kids taking part in the project.For us this was a great day and a unique experience. I cannot image that there are better township tours than this and I will do it again if I come back to Cape Town.I would like to end this review with paying respect to Siviwe who is not only the co-founder of Vamos Tours and as such a successful entrepreneur - which in itself is a difficult challenge as anyone who has ever founded a company knows. He also did this working his way up from the township himself making this an even greater achievement and he is paying back the community by running a project for the youngest in the township where they can develop their talents and interests. I pay him my deepest respect for all this. Big up!"

My wife and I were in Cape Town for a week (and I stayed an additional week for a conference). We wanted to see one of the surrounding townships first hand to get a sense, if only for a brief moment, of how people really live outside the city.I e-mailed with Vamos to set up our tour. Our guide was Gladstone, who had grown up in Langa Township; in fact, he was able to take us to his old building and the small trailer he had purchased as a teenager. He was very knowledgeable, and pointed out to us details that we would not have otherwise noticed - such as, when the police drove by, there was a flurry of activity due to shop vendors hiding their unlicensed alcohol inventory!I think Vamos tries to keep their tours small. We did encounter another tour group that was much larger as we were walking through Langa. Our group was just myself, my wife, and Gladstone. We felt very safe throughout Langa (in fact, safer than I feel at home in some areas!), although when we went to visit Gugulethu, Gladstone wanted us to stay in the car until we reached our lunch destination, Mzoli's.The entire trip was very informative and eye-opening, especially since we had really only seen the townships through car windows on our way into and out of Cape Town. If you have any interest, I would highly recommend making time for this excursion. As with most services in South Africa, for Westerners the prices are very reasonable or even a bargain."

We\u2019d trawled through TripAdvisor (and other portals) for an absolute age to find the right township tour. We didn\u2019t want to be voyeurs, we didn\u2019t want to tag along with a half-a-dozen other tourists. What we did want was a straightforward and honest guide who\u2019d happily chat through the reality of South Africa\u2019s past.Finally we came across Vamos Tours and liked their \u2018vibe\u2019. Garth was super-quick to respond to all of my questions and I was confident in their ability to provide what we were looking for.As the day approached, we got an email from Garth to say that our guide for the day would be Siviwe. We were also provided with his contact details etc. Siviwe turned up, bang on time, and introduced himself. It was at this point I knew we\u2019d got the best guy. Smart, smiley, chatty and very, very cool. We\u2019d struck gold here, I was sure! To make it even better was the fact that these tours are private, it was just me and my partner. Siviwe drove us towards the township and chatted along the way. No subjects were taboo and I learnt more in the first ten minutes speaking with him than on the previous ten days I had spent in SA.We arrived in the township and Siviwe turned the engine off and chatted for a good ten minutes about the history of SA (much, much more than you\u2019ll ever get from a book). So compelling was his story that it brought tears to my eyes (I\u2019m a bloke so I\u2019d never properly cry, clearly) it made me smile, a little lumpy-throated again before ending on a high.We set off again and stopped off at a local craft/education centre where one of the ceramicists told us their goals and achievements. A proud guy. We could then take a look at some of the stuff on sale. But there was absolutely no pressure to buy, none. Because Siviwe had moved the (new, air-conditioned) van while we were in the centre, we were able to walk with him though the streets. He explained the goings on of the township (where he himself lives) and gave us the full low-down of how life really was. This wasn\u2019t a \u2018Disney\u2019 tour. Everybody we passed were keen to smile and the kids all wanted to high-five us. To see their smiles was something else and affected me more than I could imagine. We continued through the streets (passing bigger groups who clearly couldn\u2019t expect anything like we were experiencing) and took a look in some \u2018hostels\u2019, which housed numerous families. We then came across a bunch of kids who were enjoying a \u2018kick-around\u2019 with a ball that had seen much better days. I\u2019d sort of expected this so I\u2019d brought a few new decent footballs from London and pumped them up before lighting up lots of faces! This was something else and totally priceless. We then went on to a shack and spoke to one of the girls who was living there. Totally humble and 100% focused on being the best she could be by studying hard and refusing to feel sorry for herself. Finally, we then headed off to another township (handed a few more balls/lit up little faces) before going to M\u2019zolis for one amazing Braii (our very first!) lunch.Throughout our few hours together I learnt heaps. I felt that Siviwe was more of a friend by the end of the trip and I have a huge amount of respect for him as a person, for what he does and for what he stands for.A totally priceless experience for very, very little money. Go, go, go Siviwe, you\u2019re something else. Vamos tours rock!"

Everyone was so friendly, and welcoming, it was fantastic. The boys got to help slice and dice some chips (fries) at an informal fish and chip shop, they loved the sheep head bit, and we all learned a huge amount. We visited several of Thando's friends and families in different parts of the township, so got to see a \"middle class\" area as well as the poorer shacks. Would highly recommend it.

Siviwe gave us a full look into life in the township - he shared his vision for a bright future for the people of Langa, and we learned about the education, traditions, and culture of the supportive community. We had a chance to meet local artists, visit entrepreneurs, learn the \"click\" of Xhosa from a sweet child, clap to the upbeat music at Sunday church, and share a delicious home-cooked meal.

People have asked us if we felt unsafe, so I thought we should mention here that we felt 100% safe at all times. Langa is the oldest township with a very strong community culture. Crime levels are low as everyone knows everyone else and if anyone did do anything wrong, they'd be quickly reprimanded in their local way. The residents did seem to welcome us and Gladstone explained that this is because they want perceptions to chance and through educating as many tourists as possible, it helps offset the often inaccurate perceptions portrayed by the media. The 2.5 hour walking tour is not to be missed, it gives you a genuine insight into the people of SA that will certainly enhance your trip and if you're anything like us, the memory will last a lot longer than the time of the tour."

I have to admit that my township tour with Vamos was a couple of years ago and it is only now that I am writing a review! I apologise to Siviwe as I had promised to write one on my return from my holiday to Cape Town in 2010! Having had plenty of time to reflect, I can honestly say that this excursion was the most moving and memorable one I have had for many years. Siviwe started by explaining the history and gave us a really honest account of life in Langa before we arrived. We felt confident that we were safe and walked round the streets just chatting with the locals and asking questions. The highlight of the trip was watching the performance by Happy Feet Dance company in a small garage, this was really special as it was in Siviwe's own childhood neighbourhood, which was one of the most deprived in the township. The youngsters were clearly dedicated to putting on a good performance for the visitors and were even more excited to see Siviwe, who had just purchased a video recorder for the group, so they could watch their own performances. The tour is extremely good value, but any extra donations to the dance group are reinvested into the project to develop the children's skills and chances of improving their lives. I was just so impressed that Siviwe was able to show the youngsters in his own community that they could have a better life through hard work and initiative. If you you only do one tour in Cape Town.... Do this one!"

We then walked through the streets to the hostel block where Gladstone lived when he first came to Langa as a young man, and briefly visited Silabulela school. We ended up with a welcome beer (it was very hot) at Mzolis in Gugulethu. We were very impressed by how friendly and positive people were. Thanks, Gladstone, this was a real eye opener and well worth the money and the time."

Our day started with Garth Angus ( the chap who acknowledges the reviews) and who is a partner with Sivewe , who does the Township tour through Langa. The morning was really rainy and overcast so Garth adapted the city tour on the fly and essentially gave us a historical overview of South Africa , from the time it was discovered 500 years ago through the end or Apartheid. We spent time in the District Six Museum and Garth' s overview of the forced evacuation of this area was fascinating. He is well spoken, intelligent and a really first rate guide. We then drove to Mzoli's for lunch. We loved the authentic experience and the braii was fabulous ! Not a great spot if you are vegetarian though. There we met Sivewe and started our Township Tour . We walked through all areas, from those where the very nice homes are situated to the shacks. Sivewe talked throughout and provided such insight into life in the Townships. ( He has no intention if leaving, by the way, notwithstanding the success of his business). Can there be a more memorable ( and valuable) experience for a child or teenager who takes so many things for granted? Although we never felt unsafe, incredibly, we were told less than 5 % of white South Africans have ever walked through a Township. If you doubt that, take your own informal poll. This tour is hire in price than many day long tours but worth it and more. Neither of us will soon forget this experience and I wish Sivewe's Happy Feet Project ( the concept of which he will explain) every successWhich he will"

My husband and I live in Cape Town and have been into the townships before but it is quite another experience being taken around on foot by a local. the townships remind us of the strength of human spirit and our collective responsibility to in some way give back to the community if we are lucky enough to not be living in a shack.Gladstone was an informative and pleasant guide. He spoke slowly for my German family and allowed us plenty of time to ask questions and do translations for the children. His relationship with the people we visited made us feel like guests rather than tourists.While chatting to Gladstone at the end of the tour I realised that although certain standard routes are covered, some 'attractions' like shebeens, sangomas (medicine woman), churches etc are visited on request. We only did a short walking tour (which was about the extent that 3 children between 8 and 10 years could cope with!) but it seems to be possible to customise the route to a certain extent. I would recommend discussing your requirements before you book and set off."

Our private tour included a colourful visit to a Baptist church where we were part of a memorable gospel service. Our favourite stop (especially for our 12 year old daughter) was at Happy Feet, a community project where young children express themselves through dance (in gumboots!!) Remember to take sweets, pencils etc to give to the children. It was a lovely experience. We took loads of photos and video and everyone we met was happy to pose. We shall be posting lots of photos back to Nathi to distribute. It was a great experience, especially with older children who will probably learn more about township life from a few hours with Nathi than reading any number of books.

Some bits were confronting (such as the cramped and ramshackle living quarters), some facts were surprising (such as the contrast of the neat and solid houses just a street away from abject poverty - people growing up in townships don't leave their cultural group behind, just because they are able to make a better living), and some parts were really entertaining (like the kids doing a rythmical dance routine wearing gum boots). We were able to interact with people, and stop whenever we saw something interesting or when we had a question. Nati is very knowledgeable and has a great sense of humour and is passionate about his fellow citizens in general and the children of the township in particular.

This was my first visit to Cape Town, and South Africa overall, and aside from playing with baby lion cubs (who wouldn't love that!), doing this tour was our most memorable and wonderful experience. Sivewe took us on a private cycling tour throughout Langa (lucky for us the rainy weather scared off the other patrons) and he shared a wealth of information with us about the township, the people, the history and the culture of the township. Probably the most memorable moment was when we were cycling by a local club (which was so small it could only really fit 10 people at best) and I insisted that we go in and I danced with some of the locals (not part of the official tour by any means). The locals thought the sight of this 34 year old white tourist dancing to their music was just hilarious (in a good way i hope) and we all had a great time. The performances of the happy feet children was also a highlight! They were all so friendly and passionate about their dancing it was inspiring. As for safety, I never ever felt like I was in danger and our car remained safe and sound outside the visitors centre for the entire duration of the tour. If you do this tour, I would definitely recommend you do the cycling tour. You can cover so much more ground than a walking tour and it was wonderful to be out in the open air interacting with the locals, seeing and hearing the vibe of the township. At one point we passed by another tour company whose tour consisted of a driver with the tourists sitting in the backseat of a car. They saw us on our bikes and you could see the instant jealousy in their eyes. If you are contemplating doing this tour and my advice to you is JUST DO IT! You won't be disappointed. Also I'd like to say that this is the first and only trip advisor review I have ever written. I don't usually tend to make the time to write reviews, but this is the first time in my life where I have felt so strongly about an experience, I had to share it."

My 18 year old niece who was entering college joined the African Studies club after this trip. I can not recommend Vamos highly enough. They are thorough pros."

Siviwe -our guide is inspiring, knowledgable and so passionate about his people and country. He not only showed us the townships but made us feel and understand. We laughed so much and it was such a positive experience. Our kids played with the children and did clapping games, we were invited in to peoples homes and businesses and we had the most AMAZING lunch. The best part was when we got to meet the children from his not for profit organization Happy Feet and see the kids perform for us. We truly loved it. We have been traveling around the world for the last 3.5 months with our kids (7 and 9) and this is one of the things that will stay with us forever. THIS IS THE TOUR TO DO if you visit cape town."

We had just arrived in this vibrant and interesting city and Ursula's tour was a brilliant way to get an understanding of the historical context. Ursula is a fabulous guide and we thoroughly enjoyed the tour. If you can arrive 15 mins early the exhibition on diamonds and precious stones in the basement of Prins (where you meet and purchase tickets) is well worth doing. Thanks Ursula!"

She shared that she has been giving these tours foe sixteen years, but it seemed as fresh as the first time to us. Many commented about her knowledge of the Cape Town history, and just as impressive was her love of architecture. Our friend lives in Cape Town and he also said he learned so much. Great tour with a warm hearted women. When we asked I'd she would accept a tip for her excellent services, she told us to give that money to a local church charity. Enough said!"

We loved the experience and picked up a lot of new points that have been missed during our previous four stays in Cape Town.

While I have been there many times on business I have not had the opportunity to do a walking tour. We signed up for Wanderlust and got Wolfgang, he was terrific. His background was in languages at one of the local universities but his local knowledge in the quirky architecture and folklore of Cape Town was excellent. My favorite piece of the tour was a piece of plaster work over the old slave detention center where he explained that the sculptor was not very happy with the British and decided to have some fun. He depicted the lion as a feeble sort an the Unicorn looking back towards the lion thinking this guy is not going to give me any grief! I have probably messed up the story but go visit with Wolfgang and he will give you the real story."

Ursula, our guide, was incredibly knowledgable, engaging and displayed an obvious passion for the city, its inhabitants and its history. Every aspect of the tour was clearly explained and thoughtfully presented. I was particularly impressed with the sensitivity and consideration that was given to some of the less beautiful facets of Cape Town's past as well as how respectfully Ursula spoke about all of the people and cultures that make this place so special. I can't recommend this tour enough, it was one of the most informative and enjoyable I have done. The time past far too quickly and I was actually sad when it ended. I really feel like I gained a new love for Cape Town and Ursula is to thank for this. Every question we asked was answered on topics including architecture, politics, religion, history and language. In terms of making sure you get the most out of the tour I recommend you wear good walking shoes and bring along a snack and a bottle of water.

Ursula adapted quickly and I have never seen nor heard someone switching that easily from German to English and vice versa. I do speak both languages fluently, but Ursula gave me the impression that it is actually one language. Listening to her switching wasn't difficult at all, one could follow her explanations all the time.The walk is a good work out for your legs and your conditions (I must say, I am 9 month pregnant and only 2 weeks away from giving birth) and it is worth every minute of it!

I'm glad we did it early on in our visit. Especially impressive was that she conducted the tour in both English and German simultaneously. Ursula clearly loves Cape Town and knew a great deal about the past and present of all the places we visited, imparting lot of interesting information. I particularly enjoyed the foray into the Bo Kaap which I wasn't sure about visiting alone, but the whole tour was excellent."

            "review": "Cape Town walk. The pleasure of Ursula Stevens' walk through central Cape Town is as much in her views of the place she's lived in for forty years or so as in what one sees. Her attitude to the city is one of deep affection and her enthusiasm for the place shines through. You'll get some history, of course, but also a sense of what this city is like to live in now, today, and she steers clear of the obvious political dilemmas with which in South Africa are so prevalent. It's the tolerance of the different cultures one for the others which is pointed out, a much more human approach than that of the conflicts which are so often the stuff of South African discussion. As for the walk, well, you get an apercu into Cape Town which gives you plenty of scope to make your own more detailed visits later, and you're left with a basic and clear view of what makes up the city and a strong desire to look at it more closely and in greater detail. We have been doing just this in the days since taking the tour, which hugely enhanced the pleasure of city wandering."

If you've ever wished you could walk around a new city with someone who's lived there for decades, hearing all about the neighborhoods and history, this tour is for you. Definitely recommended, particularly as an intro if this is your first visit to Cape Town. Ursula is a font of knowledge, and is friendly and easy to understand as well. In addition to showing you various Cape Town landmarks, she'll suggest other attractions that this tour doesn't cover (like the castle) and give you tips for how much time you should expect to spend on them. The tour isn't terribly cheap but it's definitely worth the price.When I took the tour I was the only person on it, which for me was a plus -- I could ask all the questions I wanted. Had some fun discussions of the various architectural styles on display in Cape Town!Expect to spend around 2.5 hours walking around the city center and Bo Kaap, some of it on cobblestones, so wear sensible shoes. If it's summer, you may want a hat or sunscreen -- you'll spend plenty of time in the sun.If you don't enjoy history this may not be the tour for you. But if you do, sign up!"

For us, that's what really made the tour worth it; we'd already been in Cape Town a few days, long enough to accumulate some questions about the fascinating city that is Cape Town. She was very attentive, and made sure we knew where we were going for the rest of our stay at all times, and even recommended the best service for Christmas Mass (St.George's Cathedral), which turned out to be one of the best services we'd ever attended anywhere in the world. While Cape Town is easily navigable without a tour, if you're curious about the city at all, Ursula's tour is a must."

I chose this guided tour because you don't have to book in advance: you just turn up at 11 at the information point in Burg Street, which is very convenient. Wolfgang was an excellent guide, one of the best I have ever had. He has a wide knowledge of Cape Town and knows how to transmit it in a very entertaining way.  It was really interesting to hear him talking about architecture (I loved the Art Deco builiding of Old Mutual or how he taught me to differenciate an Afrikaans house from one built by the descendants of the English) or explaining the different types of trees in Company Gardens.... What I most liked was the attention he pays to details of historic events, the kind of things you wouldn't find in a guide book and that turn a walking tour into a very enjoyable and experience. I was also very grateful to him, because that day I was the only one attending the tour (I guess because the autumn was already there and there are not many tourist at this time of year). He could have told me that he had a minimum number of people attending, which I would have completely understood, but he dedided to do the 2'5 hour tour only for me. It was a luxury!"

Our guide, Ursula, made every moment of the walk so interesting that the time flew by. We visited places we would never have thought to go to and got an insight into the present day and history of Cape Town. Ursula never bored us with long lectures but instead gave us snippets of information which we found easy to remember. She was also interested in our safety warning us of the dangers of being a pedestrian! There were just three of us taking the walk on this particular day. Norman and I from Northern Ireland and a lady from England. This made it a very personal experience for us.Thank you, Ursula, for such a memorable walk"

Walk with Ursula and you see Cape Town not through foreign eyes but through the eyes of a native. Architecture is among her passions, particularly anything art deco. Though Ursula is no spring chicken, she has the energy of a much younger person. Walk with her. You won't regret it."

An excellent and informative guide that gave us a lot of information of the history of sites as well as the South African history. After being traveling here for 10 years; I learned more this day than the previous 10 years of the S-A culture and history.If you ever need (and you might think you don\u00b4t) an excellent day of Cape Town - call them!We watched the seals from the boat at Hout Bay, we visited the Cape Point, we saw the penguins at Boulders beach and we finished off with wine tasting in Constantia..."

Thank you so much African Blue tours and congratulations to David, Valentine , Duncan and Matthew !A few day trips with this team made me addict to SA.With Matthew we spent a fabulous day exploring the West Coast National Park and the Cape Peninsula.

            "review": "family holiday. We can't rate African Blue Tours highly enough!!! David, the owner of the company, was our extremely knowledgable, amiable and passionate tour guide. He took our family of 5 on two private day trips, Cape Peninsula and District Six/Langa Township.He managed to combine his vast knowledge of the area as a local with an easy ambience and attention to detail making our tours tailored to our wishes and seamless in management. But we had fun too!! And learnt so much. The Cape Tour was fabulous, with personal touches such as providing cold water bottles, showing us where he surfed as a teenager, taking us to the non-tourist side of boulders beach, reserving us a great view lunch table at Cape Point restaurant, giving us a choice of wine estates, even keeping us calm as a wayward baboon came to check us for food whilst watching the ostriches!! All the while giving us snippets of local info, historical references and current political news. The tour to District Six and Langa though was something else. He introduced us to a whole subject matter that we had very limited knowledge of previously, and it opened our eyes to the huge traumatic politics of apartheid in this area of SA.David took us to the museum which was fascinating, and then a car tour of the area including the now very desolate district six and showed us with very precise knowledge where the old tracks and houses were, where the remaining churches and mosques fitted in.David has a very good friend and working colleague, Odwa, a wonderful and clever 26yr old man who was brought up in Langa Township, and still lives there. Odwa took us on a walking tour of the township, he reassured us of our safety and of our being very welcome, and that the local people would be very pleased to open up their homes and show us how they live. It blew our minds away seeing all the housing/shelters and what the township means to the people who dwell there. We visited the orphanage and saw the children's beautiful and fabulous welcoming dance. It was truly humbling. Would thoroughly recommend taking your children there and meeting Odwa and hearing the story of Langa. "

Karen our guide picked us up from our hotel on time and immediately put us at ease with her friendly approach and informative chat about Cape Town. The drive down to the Cape was really interesting and alongside the scenery we saw a huge variety of birds, animals and flora, with Karen able to give us a great commentary on what we were seeing. Excellent lunch at the Two Oceans Restaurant with great views. The afternoon saw us taking in the Boulders Beach peguins and then the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens which really are a \"must see\". Overall an excellent tour and well worth the money."

Matthew had very interesting information about Cape Town, and it was really great hearing about the area from someone who grew up there. The van was very comfortable with only 6 of us for the day. We hit all the big stops and had plenty of time to hike up to the Cape Point lighthouse, take pictures, hang out at the beach with penguins and even got to spend an hour at Kirstenboch. Wonderful views and beautiful weather all day. Had a great time and I have already recommended this tour to another couple who was traveling to Cape Town."

David was very quick to reply and in no time we had agreed for pick-up at the apartments I was staying at, along with an outline itinerary for a private tour. We are a family of 5. We have 3 sons, one disabled and two other 'adults'.The day before the tour, David contacted me as the weather forecast wasn't good for the day of the trip, and offered to reschedule for a day or so later, when the weather may be better. Whilst appreciated, we had other arrangements and needed to keep with the original date.We were picked up by our driver and guide, Karen, and we again agreed loosely what we wanted to do and where we wanted to go. Of course, no-one controls the weather, and it was pretty awful from 11ish onwards. So, as we were driving, Karen made suggestions of other things which we could do, which were really good. For example, we visited an ostrich farm and had a moment feeding them. We managed to prevent the big birds from eating our hands!We made it to Cape Colony and the lighthouse in the dry and agreed with Karen that we would walk from the lighthouse to the Cape of Good Hope where she would pick us up. When at the top of the hill at the lighthouse, the heavens really opened. We travelled back down on the funicular wondering what we would do about the walk and the rain, but then saw that Karen had waited as she thought the weather looked a lot like rain. What a relief!We went on and had lunch in a really nice restaurant on the sea front and then wanted to go on to see the penguins at Boulders Beach. It was still raining really hard, so Karen drove us as close as she could to the entrance - probably closer than she should have! - so we wouldn't get too wet. Fortunately, the weather eased up enough for us to see the penguins.We next agreed to change a visit to the gardens to a visit to a vineyard, which I was very happy about, and Karen obviously knew the staff there and arranged for us to have a special extra treat which was otherwise not available as a tasting.It also has to be said that Karen was good at informing us about where we were going, what we were looking at, some of the history of the areas we visited, and was very friendly and approachable regarding questions we had.So a great day. Did the weather spoil it? Well, it tried but when you travel somewhere in their winter/wet season, you have to be prepared. Did the tour deliver? Yes, absolutely. Karen went above and beyond to make sure it did.And the key question - would we use African Blue Tours again? Absolutely right we would!"

We liked that he involved us in deciding where to go each day. You have basic itineraries for each tour but he made sure we saw everything we wanted to see. One of our tours was of the Langa Township which I would encourage everyone to take. It's great to see the beautiful scenery of the Cape but you must experience all sides of the culture. Our guide was a local gentleman that showed us the positive and uplifting parts of the townships well as their challenges. We paid a bit extra to have the private tour. It's well worth it! The van you travel in is very comfortable and has large windows. We saw other tour groups with tons of people in them and we were so glad we had a guide all to ourselves! The owner is very conscientious and wants to make sure all your needs are met. I'm looking forward to using them again the next time I'm in Cape Town"

From the very start, we knew we were onto a winner as the owner, David, took one look at my misguided clothing choices and promptly lent me his African Blue jacket for the tour to prevent me freezing throughout the day! Our guide, Duncan, was friendly and clearly knew Cape Town really well. He was constantly advising us of the key historic points relating to each of the city's attractions and was always volunteering to take photos of us for our scrapbook. Highlights of the tour had to be Boulders Beach for the penguins, Hout Bay for the seal colony boat trip, complete with eccentric locals feeding the seals at the dock, through to the climb to the lighthouse at the top of Cape Point. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend African Blue Day Tours to anyone visiting the city, and want to thank Duncan and David for their hospitality, knowledge and friendliness. Well done boys!"

David was our tour guide and picked us up from the hotel (myself and my 3 kids ages 6, 8 and 10). We visited the District 6 museum and learned a bit of the history of the area.

Absolutely a MUST for everyone. I was a little concerned before we went about safety but as I quickly learned the township is incredibly safe, the people are very warm and inviting and our guide made us feel right at home, even teaching us some words in the local language so we could better greet the people. We visited several different types of houses there and is was incredibly impactful. I think this is a MUST do for a trip to Capetown."

I have to commend this company for their flexibility and professionalism.Duncan was our guide and he was most knowledgeable (facts and figures on the ready); friendly and quite frankly saved us a lot of time and hassle. We were booked to go to Table Mountain the next day and if it weren't for Duncan we would never have gone, as the weather changed the next day and the mountain cable way closed. He was kind enough to double check for us and organised for us to go that very day... I would recommend this company to anyone going to Cape Town as they will give you the full experience of the city and its sights but with none of the hassle. We where picked up and dropped off on time as well."

They had one day to see the city and wanted to have a lot of flexibility with the itinerary and length of time at each stop. Henry was their tour guide and both my husband and daughter raved about the day they spent together. Henry was very informative about the history of the city and S.A. The highlights of the day were stops in Soweto, the Apartheid Museum and Constitution Hill. My husband told me that they could never have seen so much of the city on their own. Many thanks to David for arranging the tour and his quick responses via email as we decided what to do in Jo'burg. I highly recommend this tour company."

Duncan our tour guide arrived at my hotel on time and was very friendly. He gave us a brief description of our itinerary which included Seal island cruise. Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope. This was an absolutely wonderful tour and a great value too. Duncan made sure we all had a good time and was a true professional. He was well prepared for the tour polite and friendly despite us making extra little stops to shop or have some ice cream along the way. We had lunch at Two Oceans, great seafood. I enjoyed seeing the Penguins and the drive along Hout Bay. This tour was one of the highlights of my trip to South Africa. Thank You Ducan and African Blue for a fantastic tour."

During the trip, Duncan (our guide) impressed us with his attention to detail, willingness to go the extra mile, his knowledge, and his eagerness to pick up new knowledge and experiences.

From the planning stages to our stay in Cape Town the service could not be faulted, even helping us do a shopping trip when we first arrived! We were met by David and Matt at the airport in Cape Town and were lucky enough to have Matt for the rest of our tours and travel. His knowledge and passion for the area and South Africa was amazing and he was so keen we see everything possible in our short time in Cape Town. They thought of absolutely everything, even bringing a car to the airport purely for our luggage!The Shark Diving was such an incredible experience, seeing a total of 5-6 different sharks. I would advise to definitely take sea sickness tablets, even if not normally seasick! Although you definitely feel better when in the cage...with your mind on other things!The Cape Duet Tour was also incredible, although obviously a lot to do in a day we fitted everything in, including a lovely lunch in Simons Town.I would recommend African Blue Tours to everyone and will definitely use them again when we return!"

Matthew was our guide, a really friendly knowledgeable guy who was clearly very experienced and knew how best to avoid the crowds on the busiest day of the year. We then followed this up with a day trip to one of the safari reserves, which David transferred us to and from himself - an unforgettable experience and a great introduction for anyone wondering if they would like a safari or not... this will definitely make your mind up for you. It was great to chat to David on the drive there and back and find out lots about the culture and history of the region and the future of tourism in the region. Finally, David arranged a shark dive experience for us which was something I will never forget. This is arranged through an external company that David deals with, but the day was perfect. All three experiences were magical and I couldn't recommend David and his team enough. Even if you are not sure what you would like to do in Cape Town (or other parts of the country) i'd recommend getting in touch. David clearly knows both the country and the tourism industry inside out and i'd trust him to plan the vacation for you."

We need that some times.Warning - if traveling to Cape Town in general, but specifically Cape Point during the summer seasons, it WILL be windy. We're from the U.S. so we think Chicago is \"the windy city\" but Cape Town brings it to a whole new level. My wife and I agree we've never in our lives experienced anything like it. So be prepared, and don't wear lose fitting sunglasses or hats because they'll be gone before you know it. We stopped at the old and new lighthouses at Cape of Good Hope (previously \"Cape of Storms\" which is more accurate given the wind) and be sure to walk up the hill instead of the cable car because there are additional spots along the way to take pictures you won't get via the cable car. And exercise never hurt anybody :)We saw a fire along the way which have been happening at higher rates because of the drought so our drive went on a bit of a detour but we were fine with it. We stopped to visit the penguins (one of the windiest spots so wear long sleeves even if it's hot if you want to avoid getting pelted by the sand). The R65 per Adult admission was a bit high for a few minutes of looking at penguins, you basically pay that much to get good close up pictures. And on the way back, stopping at Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens is an absolute must! We could've spent all day there. Amazing foliage and views of the mountainside one way, and the city and beaches the other. All in all, a wonderful day. Thanks Matthew!"

Highlights were the penguins at Boulders Bay, relaxed lunch at Simon's Town, and Cape Point.Although the trip was enjoyable, there were a few things that could have been improved: the vehicle's suspension was poor and air con unit's generator pumped out warm air, rendering it useless. We opened a window so no big deal, but I'd have preferred air con to wind blowing in my face. Also, instructions to other members of our group were seemingly either unclear or not adhered to, so we ended up having lunch after 3pm. Again no big deal for us but you expect things on such a packed trip to run like clockwork and have lunch earlier than 3pm.A good trip and hopefully the few negatives can be improved for others in future."

Matthew also pre-booked our lunch at a very nice restaurant (Bertha's) in Simon's Town. We felt like a friend was showing us around rather than a typical tour guide.

After lunch at Aquila, Matthew drove us to two wine farms, Warwick and Muratie, each very nice, and very different from each other. We did tastings at both and enjoyed the drive through the Stellenbosch area. Saw several baboons sitting on the guard rail of the road, watching us pass by!

He was patient, professional and very knowledgeable in the areas of history, geography and nature. Places we visited offered both magnificent views & enriching experiences. Thanks again, Duncan, for the well conducted tours, the exciting ride up to Signal Hill to catch the noon gun and the beautiful sunset captured during the scenic ride back to Cape Town Central from Kirstenbosch. Kudos to David, who, having checked the weather forecasts, took the initiative and efforts (by mail & phone) to contact us to swap the date for our private tour from Wed to Tue to avoid missing the Table Mountain given the rainy forecast for Wed. Proven to be a wise decision and we were blessed with beautiful sunshine. If you are searching for a tour operator in Cape Town, look no further!

Matthew explained us a lot about the area, the people, and the history. We also had very interesting conversations on the time before and after end of apartheit in south africa. It was a great day and we got a lot of impressions and information, We can highly recommend this tour and of course our guide Matthew."

He was informative and very open too and appeared to be very honest with his answers to questions about his community that he could have avoided or been evasive with. Being a local resident of the Langa township for me at least, gave it an authenticity that may otherwise have been missing. The Cape tour was also a great day made better by having the very friendly and accommodating Matt as our guide. The trip was diverse from penguins to wildflowers and from the cape and its beaches to historical monuments. Matt could answer all the questions asked and did it with great humour and an obvious love of his country and interest in his guests having a great time."

His enthusiastic conversations on flora, fauna, geography, history, politics and surfing kept us informed throughout the 8 hour trip around the cape peninsula. Highlights included the penguin colony, a very windy cape national park, and Chapman's peak. We didn't waste time on lunch and had plenty of time to explore the wonderful Kirstenbosch botanical gardens where Mandela's strelitzias were in full glory. Scones and jam at the park were a nice way to finish off a terrific day."

He helped arrange how it would be best for us to spend that particular day in Cape Town. About 2 weeks before our arrival in Cape Town, another tour guide of ours had a schedule conflict. David was more than happy to move our originally scheduled Wednesday tour to Monday to help us and the other tour guide out.We were picked up on time by Matthew, bright and early. We first headed off to the remains of District 6. Along the way, he explained the history of the area. Our visit to the District 6 museum afterwards really brought our experience at the actual site there to life and gave us a clearer perspective.When we arrived in Langa, we had a brief tour of the visitor center. Once our guide Odwa arrived, we started a walking tour. Odwa would walk and explain certain areas to us. Then we would hop in the van and head off to different areas of Langa for more sights and information. Odwa was fantastic! We were not apprehensive about visiting a township, but Odwa made it so welcoming and safe. At the end of our day with African Blue, Matthew dropped us off at the Waterfront to catch our ferry to Robben Island. He gave us great directions where to board the ferry, and after he parked, he met us there to make certain we made it there okay. Matthew was not as engaging as some of our other tour guides, but he did a very good job and we saw everything we were promised. Odwa made our day very memorable too. All in all, a great morning of enlightenment!"

Although the reserve cannot be compared with a 'real' safari - the reserve was fenced, and also the lions were separated from the other animals - it was nice to see all the animals such close. We also booked a City Tour, which was a little shorter than normal because we were the only two who had the trip at that day. Nevertheless, Matthew told us a lot about Cape Town and gave us a good view of the life over there. Unfortunately, the Cableway up to the Table Mountain was closed, but we drove up to the hill which still gave us a nice view over the city,"

His breath of knowledge stretched way beyond the content of the tour and was much appreciated. We saw the entire cape peninsula in the 9 hours we were together but left feeling it was just the right amount of things to do and see. Both the optional seal and penguin excursions are totally worth it so take advantage of them. Overall a wonderful day of sightseeing that generated many lasting memories."

Our first stop was the Anura Winery and we sampled wines with a selection of jams and cheeses. This was a great start to the day. From there we drove to Franschhoek and were given ~ 2 hours to shop and have lunch. This was too long for me. There was a wonderful Arts & Crafts faire with some vendors selling food. I had a good lunch and shared a picnic table with a local family. The next winery was Eikehof Winery where we tasted wines outside under ancient oak trees. The owner poured the wines! We then drove to the historic & university town of Stellenbosch where we had 40 minutes to explore and shop. Unfortunately it was Saturday afternoon and many of the stores had closed. We didn't make it to the 3rd winery before they closed (Vergenoegd) but we were able to walk the grounds.

The trip was well organized by David Smith, who was always prompt in responding to emails and giving us as much information possible prior to the trip. I am South African, and African Blue Day Tours have made it possible for me to explore and experience the beauty of our coastline. Well done to you all, I surely recommend African Blue Day Tours to anyone who wants to see the true beauty of the South Africa coastline in a one day trip :)"

Even though my African Blue tours were outsourced to Hylton Ross and another company for the shark cage tour, everything went off without a hitch and I had a great time. For African Blue tours part, I must say that David Smith did an excellent job of communicating to me clearly all the details that I needed to know prior to departure, and he was very quick to respond to all my questions via email and texting; his competence, as well as his professional and friendly demeanor were greatly appreciated...especially since I was a bit stressed out due to my procrastinating till the last minute to make tour arrangements for Capetown...totally my fault but he worked with it (which may explain why the tours were outsourced)! Anyhow, kudos to African Blue and David Smith...hope I am lucky enough to return to South Africa someday to try some more of the tours- they all look so fantastic! :)"

Our guide was Duncan who was very friendly and professional and made our day a memorable one. We initially booked a group tour but ended up having a private tour at no additional cost. Duncan is very knowledgeable about Cape Town area and made us feel relaxed, no rushing, we enjoyed every stop, took loads of pictures and we had a great meal next to Boulders Beach. We will definitely book tours with this company next time we are in Cape Town."

He was very knowledgable on the Cape Town area as well as South Africa. He was polite, friendly and made the trip well worth the cost.This tour has been by far the best tour we have taken here in Cape Town. They picked us up where we were staying all the way out in Hout Bay and dropped us off at the end of the day. We got to see areas of Cape Town we would not have other wise gotten too. This trip is a little expensive but well worth the cost. I would recommend it to anyone who is visiting Cape Town. Over all excellent tour!!!!!"

He started our tour by driving to the heart of District Six, where he stopped and gave us an overview of what happened there before taking us to the museum. After visiting District Six and Langa in the morning, Thabiso dropped us off at the harbor, and showed us where to catch the ferry for Robben Island and where to have lunch. We had a marvelous day despite the depressing aspects of the different sites, which are very much worth experiencing and provide unique perspectives on some of the darker moments in South Africa's history."

He knew lots of little side stories and anecdotes about each place we went, and was really nice about stopping for pictures and taking photos of my husband and I in each place. Since we did the private tour we were able to spend a little extra time in the areas that most interested us\u2014like swimming with the penguins at Boulder beach! Definitely a highlight of the day! Duncan shared a lot of fun local facts and recommendations that we used the rest of our time in Cape Town, too.

We did the Township Tour - an absolute must, Robben Island and a half day in the wine country. It was comforting to know that we had arranged all this with David before we left home.Our guide for the Township Tour was a native of Langa Township. His name was Ludumo Dwaha and he was just fantastic! He gave us such and insight and you could tell how easily he was connecting with the people who invited us into their homes and kindergarten, He also gave us great demos of the click sounds in the Xhosa language. Ludumo came to our hotel in a timely fashion and we had a great morning. If there is one tour that one must book in Capetown, this is the one! Ludumo also had our Robben Island tickets for the afternoon and showed us where to get the boat. Robben Island was very interesting but if you have a weak stomach, avoid the boat.It is still very important to see if you can get there.The next day we did a half day tour of Stellenbosch and the wine country with none other than David himself and his lovely wife, Michelle, who went to the university in Stellenbosch.The town was quaint and Michelle filled us in on the university.We are not wine drinkers at all but it was worth it to see the beautiful vineyards and landscapes. We did appreciate that David took us to a very unique and beautiful winery calledMuratie and if you love wine, you must go there.I highly recommend African Blue Tours for your next trip to Capetown."

From the moment I first inquired about the excursion, David was great to work with. He was quick to respond to any of my questions which made me very comfortable about booking with him. The tour itself was eye-opening and inspiring. David and Matthew picked us up at our accommodation (they ran a few minutes late due to a traffic stop). David was a great guide and very informative as we drove to the township. He was able to give us insight into what it was like to grow up 'privileged' during the Apartheid era before we got to the township. David then left us in the very good and capable hands of Odwa, a resident of Langa. Odwa was a fantastic guide and gave us a great tour of the township. It's difficult to put into words all that was seen and experienced, so suffice it to say, i would highly recommend this tour.After the township tour ended, David picked us up and brought us to the waterfront to catch the ferry to Robben Island. There was a bit of a hassle getting onto the ferry, but there is nothing David could have done about it. We had tickets for the 1pm crossing, but due to overselling and the lateness of the returning ferry, the 1pm ferry was full so we didn't board the next ferry until almost 2. Something to keep in mind if you have time constraints.The Robben Island tour itself was remarkable. The bus ride around the island for an orientation was pleasant. The bus guide did a good job of explaining what life was like around the island. However, it wasn't until we got to the prison and met Derek that the visit came to life. Derek was a political prisoner on the island in the late 80s until his release when all political prisoners were let go. His first-hand account of the treatment and conditions really brought the tour alive.David did an outstanding job putting together this tour for us so i can highly recommend his company as one to book with."

It all seemed to move effortlessly and next thing you know we were off to the next great spot.

He was fantastic and I can't recommend him enough. I really mean it, stop searching and just book with him. You won't go wrong."

It's almost a year since we have seen David Smith of Africa Blue, and I still keep telling people about what a great time we had with him.We had several experiences with him over a period of 6 days - all great!Firstly, he got us the Robben Island Tour in the 'nick of time'. We had arrived by cruise ship and were late docking so, with military precision and a casual, yet efficient manner, he made sure we got there in time.He guided us around Cape Town and Table Mountain. I like his style. He gives you enough information and enough time to yourself. Some guides just keep talking and nothing sinks in. He has a healthy balance.A few days later, he collected us in Franschhoek and guided us for 5 days to various destinations and attractions on the \"Garden Route\".Throughout this time, David had to deal with varying numbers of Aussies as some joined different parts of the activities. In total, there were 14 people.All-in-all, a big \"thank you\". We thoroughly enjoyed every moment."

Weather indicated there would be rough tides and everything looked like all things wouldnt happen. David did such a good job with arranging all activities associated with the tour. He was very engaged (even before we reached to SA) and kept us abreast to all matters that had to do with the dive. Even after our orginal tour was cancelled he made a special effort to arrange another tour for us. Trust me when i say, you will be well taken care of.

My cohorts, a gentleman from Austria and one from Germany, were great company and we all agreed to let David choose. He did a fantastic job...Fairview, Solms Delta and Tokara did not disappoint in experience, views or taste. Our lunch stop in Franchoek was a delightful break. The next day, I embarked on a day trip with David to see the Cape Peninsula. This time I was accompanied by two American ladies who were a blast! Every stop was worthwhile, and David even allowed us a couple of extra stops on the way by request. He even steered us away from experiences he deemed \"too touristy\" and encouraged to have the better experience. This is no cookie cutter tour. He was a marvelous guide and it was absolutely safe and fun for a woman traveling alone. I highly recommend anyone traveling in the area to contact African Blue Tours. They are exceptional!"

The tour, however, was great, and David (of African Blue) was very helpful. So this review is mostly a review of David and African Blue.We were on our honeymoon and while we were on our own on safari and in Cape Town, we were looking for a Garden route group tour for a few days in the middle of our trip. We booked a great 4 day tour with David, who also helped to arrange our hotel in Cape Town. As i mentioned our tour was great, but David had it provided by a different operator. When we arrived in Cape Town after the tour, there was a problem with the room that the hotel wouldnt fix, so as a last resort, we called David to help us sort it out. He actually came over at 9pm and convinced the hotel to give us a new room for the night, and to fix the problem the next day. What a great advocate!We also booked a private wine tour with David, but my wife was sick that morning so we ended up on a tour of a doctor's office instead. David helped us sort things out, and we booked a second day with him so we could ultimately do our wine tour as planned.In sum, we can't really comment on the quality of the garden route tour, because ours ended up operated by another company. But it was a fantastic tour nonetheless! I can comment on how great David was with the booking process, and how great an advocate he was when we were in South Africa."

Also went on the one day Safari and to Tygerberg Zoo. The Safari was great and David Smith provided history and insight to the area making it an unforgettable trip. The Zoo was nice but small. I would bypass for a trip to the wine country. Dont miss Table Top or a harbor cruise. David's associate Michelle was also extremely knowledgeable and a pleasant guide. Good times and good humor. I have travelled extensively and African Blue Tours is at the top of the list. If you go to Cape Town let African Blue be your guide."

After being turned down by other providers we've found African Blue Day Tours and they arranged for a driver to pick us up 2 hours later.Ludumo Dwaba was not just a great driver, but also a wonderful tour guide. He explained everything to us with a lot of detail and showed us the real life in the townships and settlements. From goat head BBQ to herbalists and traditional African healers we got to see everthing within the townships. This was a very educational day and we are very glad that we got the opportunity to learn so much about the history and culture of south africa!"

I was given the task to research and plan a trip through the Stellenbosch wine country: a task that took hours across multiple days cross referencing sites and whittling out the paid tourism posts on the internet. Skip ALL OF THIS, and hire David.David guided my group of 10 through wine country on a 3-stop day trip and it was the most comprehensive day on our South African holiday. I highly recommend hiring a small, local company like African Blue Tours because you get an authentic local's perspective of the area. Aside from showing up on time, providing great, comfortable transportation, the conversations we had with him gave amazing insight into the politics, culture, and geography of South Africa. Had I known better, I would have skipped all the research, worry, and planning and just had David take us to his favorite spots. I highly recommend letting him take the reigns when planning your wine country trip and let yourself sit back and enjoy your trip! African Blue Tours has the range across a wide variety of South African activities so just call them first!"

David was recommended to us and we were all certainly glad he was! Aside from the standard stuff, like showing up on time, having a nice van for transportation, and being generally knowledgeable about what he was doing- David was just a hell of a nice guy. We invited him to join us for our group lunch and he spent the meal acquainting us with the surfing ilfestyle of South Africa (another one of his passions). Aside from it being super interesting, you could tell he was just a genuinely good person. The wine tour itself was great, he selected 3 wineries for us that all had attentive staffs and amazing wines. It was a top notch day all around.I'm very happy to write this review for him and support his business in any way I can. I'd definitely recommend him to any friends that are traveling to South Africa and anyone that is reading this review. If you book a day with David, you absolutely won't be disappointed."

David was punctual, accommodating, extremely knowledgeable (not just about wine, but about local politics, surfing and all things tourism) and just a likable person. We immediately hit it off with him and asked him to join us for a nice lunch at one of the vineyards to show our appreciation (highly recommend asking him to join you, as he's a blast to chat with).I would recommend David to anyone looking for a guided tour. My only regret is that we didn't plan more of our activities through his agency. They apparently do much much more than just wine trips. http://www.africanbluetours.com/about/As an aside, I highly recommend all three of the vineyards we visited: L\u2019Ormarins, Thelema, and Tokara (excellent restaurant for lunch). The wine at Thelema was the consensus favorite and we ended up buying numerous bottles from them.Enjoy Cape Town. We most certainly did!"

Spoke with Mary Ellen Chown who gave us the details and arranged our tour. All I can say is all my expectations were wildly exceeded. This was a 2-part tour, 4 nights in Cape Town and 3 nights in Lion Sands Reserve, Kruger Nat'l Park.Cape Town is a beautiful city and the Twelve Apostles Hotel is incredible. Outstanding view, delicious cuisine and impeccable service. Mary Ellen was awesome. She helped us select some great activities and tours. Our first day there included a helicopter ride around the bay. That was fantastic, but a little short. We also did a tour to the Cape Point traveling along a highway rivaling the Pacific Coast Hwy in Cal. We passed wild ostriches and baboons, visited a beach with hundreds of penguins and enjoyed a nice lunch with an ocean view. We did a bike tour of the beautiful wine country. The second part of our tour, Kruger, was the most incredible experience of my life! We stayed in a nice bungalow with a deck overlooking a river. Right after check-in, I was on the deck and heard rustling in the trees. At first I couldn't notice anything but then a head and neck stuck out from behind some trees a little way out. A giraffe was looking my way. Wow! The stay at Kruger is all inclusive, including food,wine and beer. The meals were excellent and it seems as if they are always presenting you with food or drink. The highlight of the trip was the safaris int the bush. A guide and tracker take you in an open Range Rover in pursuit of wild animals. You go on two 3hr. safaris a day, morning and evening. On our first safari, we were within 20 ft. of a wild and very beautiful leopard. We saw lions, Cape buffalo, giraffe, birds hippos, crocodile, hyenas, antelope, a rhino and LOTS of elephants These are wild, free roaming animals. Our guide and driver, Ben was very knowledgeable of the area and the wildlife. He made the safaris exciting. We also had a visit to the Henna Preschool in nearby Huntington, That was both heartwarming and fun to see these wonderful children playing and learning.. I could go on and on about this trip. It was an experience I will never forget. "

            "review": "Lion World Tours, East Africa Safari. We had an amazing East African Safari vacation in September with The Lion World Travel, but there were things that could have been better. The quality of guides is something that left me wanting more. I thought there were more of drivers than the actual naturalist or guide who can educate me on the habitat, animal behavior and ecology of African plains. I felt I knew as much if not more, about the most of animals excluding birds, than the each driver, and didn't gain any additional insight from them. However, drivers made all out efforts to ensure that we had maximum viewing experience of all the animals including \"actual hunt\" as it took place in front of our eyes. They were courteous and safe drivers. Leopard Tours made changes that at least four of us found cumbersome and unnecessary. The driver changed the itinerary in Ngorongoro and Serengeti to an early start, and/or the whole day game drive from the morning to evening. He wanted to start at 7:00 AM in the morning, and we had to negotiate to start at 7:30 as the breakfast started at 6:30. I had to explain him that some of us are used to \"habitual natural\" morning routine after the morning coffee and breakfast, and will need more time to accommodate our routine, and we can not leave at 7:00, but would prefer 7:30 instead. Finally, he insisted on 7:15, and I told him we will try to be there at 7:15, and we did. I also told him that we would have preferred to stick to the morning and afternoon game drive as being out there whole day on the bumpy road was bit cumbersome, but we did comply with his request of a whole day game drive for two days in Serengeti with great reluctance. There was also on the issue on mishandling of our departure time despite making it sure on the day of arrival in Arusha. Leopard tour had our departure flight listed at 7:00 PM instead of 2:15 PM, and so we made sure that the time was corrected and the arrangement for transfer was agreed on. Despite this discussion on the day of our arrival, the driver announced day before our departure from Lake Manyara to Arusha that our flight information he had indicated that our flight departed at 7:00 PM, and our transfer will be arranged accordingly. I told him about our discussion on the very first day on the subject and indicated that we were assured of arrangements accordingly. He told me he would call the next day before we depart from the lodge. I insisted that he should call right away to sort our the issue and confirm the transfer arrangement to the airport. He did call and took care of it, but next day when I mentioned the situation to the very same person with whom I had a discussion the time discrepancy, and the transfer agreement on a very first day, he simply ignored me without saying a word! We did pay $50 for the taxi to the airport as had agreed upon and made it to the airport on time, but they could have handled the whole incident professionally and efficiently. Leopard tour to be more responsive to the clients. There is always a temptation to book directly with a local tour operator to save some money, but I am glad I do not succumb to the urge as I am not sure if they would care to respond to my misgivings, or go to extra mile in a critical situation to ensure my satisfaction, if The Lion World Travel was not the agency we had used, and booked directly with Leopard Tours."

She listened to every detail we wanted for this trip! We can't stop talking about it. From the camps we stayed at to the food, animals and people the trip was unbelievable. I, at first was a little nervous of going. Not my husband. Once we arrived in AfricaI I was thrilled, so happy I had the experience of a lifetime!!! Again, our agent Mary Ellen did an excellent job with our trip. If you are going to plan a trip to Africa book it with Maryellen!!! Thank you Lion World Travel!"

We had decided against the usual Capetown leg so she put together a special trip for us, It went off seamlessly---from the comprehensive instructions she provided for getting between the game camps, to the airport and even how to navigate the airport. The accommodations she selected for us were beyond fantastic. Everything was perfect---thank you Laurandie and Lion World!!"

            "review": "Luxury & Service Delivered. We started looking at packages to Africa at the beginning of the year. All we knew was that we wanted to see the Great Migration in the Mara. We became aware of Lion World on the Costco travel site, but those trips were for SA and Botswana. On the Lion World site we found a reasonable package that seemed to cover what we wanted to see in Kenya. The Serena properties we stayed in were all true luxury experiences. Our knowledgeable guides (through Pollman Tours) were able to get us up close with the wildlife and not only did we see the Big 5, but were lucky enough ( and luck is a factor in wildlife sightings) to see multiple zebra/wildebeest river crossings. Our package called for driving back from the Mara to Nairobi and we chose paying to fly back instead. It was a good decision-in fact if you're considering staying at multiple camps, I'd recommend flying between them-there's really not much to see on the roads-some of which are paved, but much is bumpy, dusty, rutted dirt. I'd also recommend upgrading to first class if you fly Ethiopian Airlines from the U.S-economy was not the best. Overall, we had a fantastic, memorable trip and appreciate all the support and assistance from Lion World and Pollman-both companies strive to insure you have a great experience."

Logistically, it was well-organized and everything happened when it was supposed to, and the guides and transportation folks were professional, timely, and very personal. Cape Town was beautiful. As far as the safari portion (both in South Africa and Zimbabwe), it was amazing to see the animals in their natural habitat, and to learn about them from very knowledgeable rangers/guides. This was perhaps the most memorable trip we have taken. Lots of activities and always something to be doing.The one downside: The long flights to get to/from South Africa were uncomfortable at best. However, South African Airways did a good job on its Africa continent flights.Kudos to Lion World Travel for a job well-done."

When we saw what Lion World Travel had to offer, and the great reviews they got, we decided to book a trip. And we are so glad we did! Laurandie was awesome in handling our travel arrangements. We got so much more than just a safari. Lion World offers so much in their 7 night stay in South Africa! We spent 4 mights in Cape Town at the great Table Bay Hotel. The Cape Peninsula is beautiful. On our first day we had a great wine tour in Franschhoek ( where in our case, we met the other Lion World tourists that would be going with us to Thornybush Game Reserve, nice plus ). We had a helicopter ride included inner tour and Laurandie arranged for us to see Table Mountain and do a shark dive, and we also added a trip down to Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope. A great stay in Cape Town!! Then on to the safari at Jackalberry Lodge (also great reviews... well justified). Just 14 people in the whole lodge! What an experience! Morning and afternoon game drives...amazing how close we got to the animals!! We saw the Big 5 and so many others both while on the game drives and at the lodge grounds! Great service and food at the lodge was a bonus. Between Cape Town and Thornybush Game Reserve, it seemed like we packed 2 weeks into one. A totally fabulous experience that we highly recommend for anyone wanting a Safari experience."

About 18 months ago, I started planning a trip to Southern Africa for my whole family (9 persons varying in age from 9 to 80) to celebrate a special occasion. One of the travel agents I contacted was Lion World Travel and I was immediately impressed by John Almeida's prompt response and helpful manner. I sent him my chosen destinations of Cape Town; small reserves in Sabi Sands or Sabi Sabi (Kruger) and Botswana; and Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. Within 48 hours I received a detailed itinerary, together with selected hotels, lodges etc. and a cost estimate based on prices prevailing at that time. Even though prices for the safari camps for 2016 were not available at that time (April/May 2015), he was able to lock in his original cost estimate in Canadian dollars, protecting me from inflation as well as the impact of a fall in the value of the CAD versus the USD. Between that time and our departure in August 2016, I frequently contacted him to make various changes and obtain clarifications. He always was very patient and obliging, meeting all my requirements. The trip itself was wonderful. Everything worked out well. No problems whatsoever. The travel arrangements in Southern Africa, the guides, the hotels, the safari camps, etc. were all excellent. Thank you, John and Lion Travel and your associates in that part of the world."

The food was wonderful everywhere we went. Our favorite dining experience was in Cape Town - restaurant Codfather's - excellent fresh seafood that you pick and they cooked. Be prepared for weather changes - weather turned from warm to chilly as we left Cape Town. In Kapama - weather changed from hot to very chilly after rain storm. Lion World did excellent job in the planning - we had no problems at all."

John Almeida has helped with both trips, and we couldn't have gone without his help! He out did himself with planning two PERFECT trips! We have now been to 7 different countries in Africa (South and East) and they were all exceptional! Every local person we met was so humble, friendly, kind and welcoming! Every lodge and hotel we stayed at deserves 10 stars for cleanliness, hospitality, food and activities. We haven't been to a lodge that didn't leave us speechless upon arrival and so sad to leave. All transportation was flawless, leaving nothing for us to worry about. There was someone waiting at each airport/air strip holding a sign with our name on it when we landed, making travel from location to location super easy and comfortable. We felt completely safe everywhere we went. There was and still is so much to see and learn. The different cultures are so interesting and amazing to learn about and observe, the food is OUT OF THIS WORLD, and the animals and other sites will leave you with memories of a lifetime! We cannot get enough!! Everyone needs to put Africa on their list of places to travel and get there ASAP. Contact Lion World Travels and John and get over and experience it yourself!!"

Cape Town and our private Cape Peninsula tour were more interesting and informative than we\u2019d anticipated. Table Mountain was awesome, city tours by the off-on Red and Yellow Line buses were interesting, and the meal/dancing/singing at Gold was good. (However, re the latter, all nine in our Lion World group regretted that while the performers danced and sang well, they never said what cultures they were representing each time. A major flaw.) Staff at Table Bay Hotel was excellent. The morning buffet was monumental, and the Brasserie offered good value (and our first taste of kudu as an entree). Discovery Tours provided an outstanding private tour of the Cape Peninsula, visiting all the sights we wanted to see as well as others our guide knew we'd like, and giving me plenty of time to take photographs.Jackalberry Lodge in the Thornybush Game Reserve was an excellent experience. Our chalet was spacious and first-rate. Food was good and plentiful. The staff was very pleasant and helpful, going all out to ensure everyone was satisfied. Game drives were interesting and at times exciting. Our ranger and tracker were very knowledgeable, and eager to show us a wide variety of wildlife in addition to the Big Five. Several times we were within 5-10 meters of lions, and once watched a pair mating right next to our vehicle. (No shame!)  On the last drive, a baby elephant we\u2019d seen before came right up to our vehicle and nosed around its side with his trunk, just below my wife\u2019s arm! The ranger was worried and unwrapped his rifle, but the watchful mother elephant fortunately didn\u2019t react negatively and the baby soon wandered away.  I\u2019m glad my wife found the Lion World offer on TravelZoo, and we feel it was an outstanding value as well as memorable experience."

My husband and I travel intentionally frequently with our children (now teenagers) and this was by far the most incredible trip ever!! Capetown is a wonderful and beautiful city with so much to do from hiking to historical tours, the very best food and wine, wine, more wine. Then off to Kapama for safari. We sat a few feel from a lion as he devoured his fresh buffalo kill, sat in the middle of a herd of elephants as they passed us by, giraffes and zebras galore, white rhino, leopard, and many more! The guides at Kapama were extremely knowledgeable, there was not a question asked that they could not answer, the resort was beautiful with our private lodging and pool and too much food (the fed us 7x a day! all delicious), Victoria falls was a worthwhile add on, \"glamping\" on the Zambezi river with hippos in our backyard and the water falls were breathtaking. What made this trip so special was Cheryl Gould and Lion World Safari, it was completely stress free! All transfers were arranged to perfection and occurred with ease, and we were escorted privately each time. We liked having our own \"down time\" in Capetown to do as we chose and Cheryl helped us decide on activities, restaurants and even made all of our reservations for us. She was extremely knowledgeable about her beloved \"home town\" and took great pride in making sure our individual needs and goals were met in every possible way. I had always heard that Africa is somewhere you go \"once in a lifetime\" but I have NO doubt that I will return and when I do it will be for certain be booked with Cheryl Gould and Lion World Safari. Any one blessed enough to be able to take this trip should not hesitate."

            "review": "An Exceptional Trip with Exceptional Service. While searching for a completely different trip, Susan came across an offer for the Planes, Trains and Safarimobiles Excursion from Lion World Travel of Toronto, Canada. Lion World has specialized in Africa tours for over 50 years. It was a too-good-to-pass-up package. The trip included 4 nights at the 12 Apostles Hotel & Spa in Cape Town, South Africa, 3 nights at the Kapama Private Game Reserve Southern Camp (including all meals and a total of 6 game drives), an overnight trip (with private cabin) on the Blue Train from Hoedspruit to Pretoria, and all transfers. Plus, it included airfare from the US to Johannesburg and return. In addition, there was an optional excursion to Victoria Falls, with lodging at the Victoria Falls River Lodge, game drives, tour of Vic Falls, and all meals. She quickly called Lion World before the package could disappear. We worked with Mary Ellen Chown who saw to all of our needs and desires \u2013 mainly including the Vic Falls excursion with a third night at the Victoria Falls River Lodge. We\u2019ve posted separate reviews of Kapama Private Game Reserve Southern Camp and Victoria Falls River Lodge on TripAdvisor.com, so we won\u2019t repeat all those details here.Our flights to and from East Tennessee were included and went without a hitch. We flew South African Airways to and from the US, within South Africa, and from Johannesburg to Vic Falls and return. We were very satisfied with all flights and all transfers. (Lion World partners with Thompson\u2019s Africa for some services there. While checking in at Vic Falls for our return to J\u2019burg, a Thompson\u2019s Africa guide who was with another tour asked us about our experience to make sure that everything had been done to our satisfaction.)In Cape Town, we first met others on the PT&S tour. The package provides for much individual choice so we only had a little interaction with the others there. Lion World offered to arrange tours in the area, but we chose to arrange private tours of our own. The 12 Apostles is a wonderful hotel located a few miles south of the city of Cape Town. They offer regular shuttles into Camps Bay and Cape Town. Cape Town and the Cape Peninsula are a wonderful area with great history. We chose to do a city highlights tour, a winelands tour, and a Cape Peninsula tour. It was a great way to start the trip.From Cape Town, we flew to Hoedspruit, where Rangers from Kapama met us. We drove directly out of the airport and into the Kapama Game Reserve. Southern Camp is a 5 star facility near the center of the 15,000-hectare reserve. Southern Camp is fenced, so dangerous animals are outside the fence (most of the time). Our lodging was a large deluxe thatch-roofed cottage with indoor and outdoor showers and a plunge pool. We had a total of 6 game drives and one game walk. While the reserve has all of the big 5, (elephant, lion, rhinoceros, buffalo, and leopard), leopards are rarely seen. We did see the other four. We also saw at least 6 antelope species, warthogs, giraffes, zebras, hyenas and many others. Meals were excellent, and they were able to handle special dietary needs, like gluten free for Susan. We would gladly return to Kapama.Next was the Train part of the PT&S Excursion. The Blue Train is often cited as one of the world\u2019s leading luxury trains. Upon boarding, we were greeted with champagne while we waited for our suite to be ready. The train is elegant, the service impeccable, and the food truly special. However, travelers should be aware that the suites are quite small. Also, the trip from Hoedspruit to Pretoria involves numerous changes of speed and several extended stops. (Otherwise, the trip would be hours shorter. The extended stop during dinner service was welcome, as it made the experience more relaxing.) It seems that the track on this route is not in good shape. The train was bumping and banging throughout the night, making sleep almost impossible. If we were to elect this package again, we would ask Lion World to substitute a flight from Hoedspruit to J\u2019burg and a night in a J\u2019burg hotel for the Blue Train, since the enjoyment of the train trip was lost because of the bumping and banging.Because we had taken the Vic Falls excursion, we had an overnight stay at the DaVinci Hotel in J\u2019burg. The hotel was quite nice and well located. We chose to take a private tour of Soweto (reviewed separately on TripAdvisor). That tour was a truly moving experience. The next morning, we were taken to the airport for the next leg of our trip, Vic Falls.We were met at the airport and taken to the Shearwater Adventures boat dock. From there, we were taken up the Zambezi River to the Victoria Falls River Lodge (VFRL) in the Zambezi National Park. VFRL has a different ambience from Kapama. Because it is in a national park, it is not fenced. It is possible at any time to encounter any of the animals native to the area on the grounds of the lodge. We were instructed to always be accompanied by a staff person when walking between our tent and the lodge between sunset and sunrise. On our last night, as we reached our tent, our guide pointed out a hippopotamus only 30 or 40 feet away. Hippos are responsible for more deaths than any other species in Africa. We were glad we had a guide.As for those tents \u2013 they were large (perhaps 20 feet by 30 feet) with a permanent raised, wood floor and a deck with a Jacuzzi. They also had an indoor and an outdoor shower. Based on reviews online, Susan requested the tent furthest from the lodge since that increased the chances of seeing animals. We were in tent 14 \u2013 the end of the trail. It was the perfect choice, not just because the hippos were near, but the view of the Zambezi River just off of our deck at sunrise and sunset was the best of any of the tents at VRFL.VFRL doesn\u2019t have the full range of animals seen at Kapama \u2013 no rhinos for example. It does have a different character, with the Zambezi River right there, baobab trees, and a good variety of game. As with Kapama, the guides and staff were excellent and highly focused on customer service. The package included two game drives a day and one trip to Victoria Falls. The Falls are every bit as impressive as their billing. Because we had added an extra night at VFRL, we elected to take a full-day excursion with Shearwater Adventures to Chobe National Park in Botswana. (When you enter Zimbabwe, you have a choice of purchasing a one-time visa, a dual-entry visa, or a multiple entry visa. We had purchased a dual-entry visa, expecting to walk across the bridge below Vic Falls to Zambia and back. Since we did not do that, we were able to visit Chobe without the cost of a second visa.)The excursion to Chobe National Park is a wonderful way to experience one more dimension of Africa. The trip began with a boat cruise up the Chobe River. Besides the expected crocodiles, we saw elephants swimming the river to reach an island for grazing. After a buffet lunch at a local resort, we were off on a game drive. Here Chobe differs greatly from Kapama and Zambezi National Park. In both of the latter areas, the only game drives were those associated with the resorts where we were staying. While they exchanged information, there never was a sense that the areas were crowded. In Chobe, there seemed to be many companies offering game drives. We were usually within sight of at least one other vehicle, and several times, we were within sight of several. When one driver radioed that he had spotted a single female lion, about a dozen vehicles converged on the same spot. Even so, Chobe is a remarkable place to view wildlife \u2013 with the best elephant sightings of any of our game drives. We also saw larger numbers of hippos than at VFRL, and a few animals that we had not seen elsewhere. We would highly recommend planning time to take Shearwater\u2019s Chobe excursion.We owe our thanks to Mary Ellen and to Lion World Travel for all of our wonderful experiences. They even had small gifts, such as Kapama ball caps, and lovely cards at each of our stops along the way. Even when we arrived back home exhausted there was a \u201cwelcome back home\u201d card awaiting us! Thanks for a job well done!"

This was a trip on my bucket list and I will definitely do this again. The hotels they lined up were top notch and special - not the typical 'hotel'. The 12 Apostles Hotel in Cape Town was in the Table Mountain property; Kapama South Camp is in a private reserve; and Victoria Falls River Lodge was in the Zambezi Park. Lion World are truly experts as they advertise in this region. The day excursions they recommended were phenomenal, Mary Ellen answered all my questions and helped also to arrange this trip which was for 3 of us without much increase in cost."

When we finally decided to go, Costco put is in touch with Lion World Travel to help with the bookings. At first, I wasn't sure about Lion World Travel because I have not heard of this particular company. But after numerous research online trying to book this myself, reviews of various itinerary, and quotes from other African tour companies with similar itinerary, I decided to give Lions World a chance. From our first conversation, our agent (Cheryl) was just super. She helped me add on extra days to the Costco offered itinerary, answered all my newbie questions, and was extremely helpful in recommending places to visit. Since she is from South Africa, there was no doubt of her expertise in the places we were planning to visit. One of the best simple item (among the many little surprises) we received from Lions Travel is a helpful guide to the countries we were visiting. In these travel size pamphlets, there were important information about visas, safety, and most of all a tipping guide for all the service we might encounter which I carried all the time. From the moment we arrived in South Africa, everything Lions World had on our itinerary was right on time. Our transfer drivers, our private tour guides (Thompson Travel), our hotels were all so diligent in making sure we were completely satisfied with their service. The only thing that did not go according to plan was the weather which of course if Lions World could control, I know they would try to make sure our trip was just perfect. Even when we had to switch days for our private tours due to impending weather conditions, Thompson Travel, the partners of Lions World located in South Africa, made it easy with a simple phone call. I cannot say enough good things about Lion World Travel and all their activity partners, Thompson travel and all their drivers and guides, and of course Cheryl who was so instrumental in planning our dream vacation."

From the time of booking until our return the service was impeccable. Our flights on Ethiopian Air were fine, food was plentiful but poor. Once we landed at Mt. Kilimanjaro, we were immediately met by a representative from Leopard Tours, the on the ground tour operator for Lion World. Pendo helped breeze our group of 19 through customs and onto a waiting bus. All of our accommodations were very satisfactory, Serena and Sopa lodges at Lake Diluti, Tarangire Park, Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater (I have reviewed each of them on their pages) most with amazing views. Our driver and guide from Leopard Tours, Moses Charles, was phenomenal! All the driver guides were excellent, but we got the best. Moses was extremely knowledgable, informative, patient and intent on creating the best safari experience possible for the five of us in his car. We loved being in Africa at this time of year. Although we were off peak, we saw so many animals including a lioness bringing down a wildebeest who then brought her three cubs back to the kill, lions up close in trees, on rock outcroppings, and 5 lounging in a bush. We saw the \" big five\" multiple times in amazingly close proximity, with the exception of the rhinos in the crater that we saw from afar. Our guides drove us out to where the migration was happening and worked hard to make our trip a success in every way. Our first day on the Serengeti was one of the most amazing and transforming of my life. It is impossible to anticipate, or truly imagine the spectacular and diverse expanse of land that is the Serengeti with the beautiful and wondrous creatures that call it home. Going on Safari had not been on my top 10 trips, but the package from Lion World was too good not to take advantage. Now, I would advise everyone who can to go to Tanzania and know that if you go with Lion World you will have the experience of a lifetime"

Taking in the gorgeous views from the included helicopter tour and from Table Mountain, experiencing the included full day tour, and enjoying the Saturday markets were a few of the highlights. Animal viewing at Shamwari was fantastic, and our ranger, Alistair, could not have been better. He was super knowledgeable and super fun. He seemed as excited as we were! The tranquil beauty of the Victoria Falls River Lodge brought on a relaxing calmness, and staying there was the perfect way to end our trip. We enjoyed the river cruise so much, we went out both nights. Elephant, baboon and hippo viewing was great here. We watched a baby elephant learning to walk and use his trunk, the behaviors of two baboon tribes living in the same area, and hippos in the water and out of the water to graze. Needless to say, seeing Victoria Falls was breathtaking. My kids thanked me again and again for taking them on such a wonderful trip. I am so thankful to Lion World Travel and Cheryl!"

An African safari has long been on my bucket list, and when I came across a reasonable-priced tour from Lion World, we jumped on it. Four friends and two cousins also booked and we all had the \"trip of a lifetime.\"Laurandie at Lion World Travel was spectacular at answering our questions and making sure our trip went off without a hitch. Our three nights at the Twelve Apostles Hotel outside of Cape Town were wonderful. Our room was very comfortable and the staff and amenities at the hotel were super. We especially enjoyed opting to have our breakfast outside on the patio overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. It may have been just a tad chilly, but lovely. Also, we enjoyed one evening with a gorgeous sunset. The other two nights were a bit cloudy. Our tour included an all-day tour of Cape Peninsula and a brief helicopter ride. Most of us chose to spend the one day (when nothing was planned), at the hotel. I enjoyed two services at the lovely spa. Food was yummy.While we thoroughly enjoyed our Cape Town time, the best was yet to come. We were at the Southern camp at Kapama Private Game Reserve. Wow! Comfy accommodations, wonderful food, great staff. Aneen and Mushi (our ranger and tracker) were super. Our game drives were fabulous; couldn't ask for anything better. Even though we cut one evening game drive short due to heavy rain and missed another night due to a vicious storm, we saw so much wildlife up close (including the Big Five), that we definitely did not feel that we missed anything. This part of South Africa had not had rain for quite awhile and some of the watering holes were almost totally dry, so they really needed the rain. On our very first game drive (evening) we saw female lions on the prowl and soon came upon them again immediately after they killed a poor pregnant impala. It was gruesome, but interesting, to watch the five lionesses feed on their kill. I also took a bush walk and saw quite a lot of animals during it too.All in all, we would not hesitate to recommend a Lion World Travel tour. It was fabulous!"

The people of South Africa are simply lovely. Caring, attentive, funny and so proud of their country. The animals left us humbled to see them in their natural habitat.and Victoria Falls is breathtaking. To thank for this adventure is Cheryl Gould of Lion World Travel, a marvel from the beginning. While in Cape Town, stay at or visit the Table Bay Hotel. Restaurant Camissa, High Tea, and their mascot Oscar, memorialized in a glorious monument (a beloved seal). We loved the Two Seas Aquarium, and right next door the Watershed, a beautiful building with individual stores selling everything African. Adjacent is a food hall that is out of this world! Our game drives were spectacular. Our camp was in the private Thorneybush Game Preserve where we stayed at the Jackalberry Lodge. This is where the word bliss comes in. Perfect in every way, and the meals were some of the best we experienced, thanks to their chef Martha. Lastly, the Victoria Falls River Lodge is where we wound down in beauty and luxury on the Great Zambizi. From here we visited Victoria Falls - a breathtaking sight. Our trip was a dream come true from the beginning to the end, and we hope yours will be the same."

Her suggestions seemed to fit us perfectly, as she had asked many questions to try to match us up with activities. Our experience was that 4 days/3 nights in Capetown and environs was fine. Our highlights were Robben Island (humbling) and the winelands. The Graff winery was out of this world. The Kapama Karula safaris were amazing. The place is stunning, and the service is very kind and gentle. The 12 Apostles hotel was lovely, and unique. The safari guides and spotters were exceptional and we can't think of anything on this venture that could have been better. Trust Cheryl. She has a good 6th sense about what you do and where you stay."

Cape Town is a great city. The third day we went shark cage diving. That was an adventure but not scary.  From there we went to the remote Kadizora Camp in Botswana. The staff and hosts, Greg and Sue, took an personal interest in all the guests and made them feel welcome. Our guide, Tuboy, was a real character and loved by everyone in our group. He was also very knowledgeable. We saw a lion and three cubs who had recently made a kill in addition to all the other animals. After that we went to Elephant Valley Lodge near Chobe National Park. The Lodge had a watering hole nearby where you could watch the animals come for a drink at night. We saw lots of animals including a leopard in the national park. They had to come down to the river to drink since it was very dry.  This was a trip of a lifetime."

Along the way Cheryl was amazing to work with - prompt in answering questions and providing her expert opinion - she made sure we knew everything we needed to have a wonderful time. She even worked with local tour companies and made arrangements so that we could swim at the top of Victoria Falls - a feat which even required a car change at the Zambia/Zimbabwe border. In addition to the service beforehand, they have extra touches as well. Lion arranged for personalized cards in each hotel room along our trip which reinforced for us that they would be there should we need anything at all. And once we got home there was a card and email to make sure we had a wonderful time. This is a boutique agency and I highly recommend them for their outstanding expertise, service, and personalization!"

Mary Ellen Chown was an outstanding agent. Below are some comments regarding impressions of various aspects of the trip.12 Apostles Hotel in Capetown - A fantastic choice with an excellent staff, comfortable beds and pillows (a pillow menu, sigh!) and delicious and beautifully presented meals. The concierge was outstanding. The views were stunning, and the housekeeping staff's uniforms added to the charm. It was very convenient to use their shuttle to the V&A Waterfront.Full day tour with Mark - He was knowledgeable and interesting. Seeing so many whales was amazing! Mark shared fascinating background info on politics in SA and in the townships. We even got to see the \"Smileys\", the sheeps' head delicacy which were cooking over bar-b-ques in the township. We were running late for our dinner to Gold Restaurant, so Mark graciously and seamlessly coordinated with our pre-arranged transportation, and drove us there directly from the day tour.Gold Restaurant - Learning to play the bongos was fun, and the entertainment during the authentic African feast was such fun.Gold's bathroom is lovely! The food was good, too.Helicopter 'flip' - Great fun, but it would have been nice if they could provide a bit longer ride than just from their site to the heli-pad at the hotel. Our sons wanted to be dropped off at the hotel, but they wouldn't allow my husband and me to ride back to their site with the pilot, even though that's where he was heading.We scheduled our own full-day tour with Cape Convoy, and loved seeing Cape Point and the botanical gardens. Our family would have preferred that those sites, rather than the winery, be included on your tour. Kapama River Lodge - We loved ending our tour with the safari, and what a gorgeous lodge! We were greeted with yummy green cocktails. The beds weren't as quite as comfortable as 12 Apostles', but they were fine.The morning and evening safaris were simply outstanding. Jakes and Michael were our ranger and tracker, and they made our experience memorable in all the best of ways. We saw things we never imagined ... a group of young male giraffes play-fighting, a lion roaring to its mate at night, leopards resting in the tree, groups of rhinocerous, hippos, water buffalo, and elephants, an injured hyena, and a warthog killed by a lion. The Range Rover seats were very comfortable, and we encountered no mosquitoes, so we stopped taking our awful anti-malaria meds! We lucked out with our fellow tour members. Ten was the perfect size group.It was pure pleasure to soak in the free-standing tub in our bathroom, with binoculars and a camera nearby to capture the wildlife right outside our room! We encountered wild deer each day on our walk from our rooms to the lodge.The food was beautifully presented. Our only concern was one night when we ate outdoors, and the buffet included chicken kebabs cooked in front of us. The cook used the same tongs handle the chicken before and after it was cooked. That made our group of salmonella-conscious Americans cringe.The only downside to the trip was the 22+ hours it took to get there from Portland, OR, and the discomfort of their economy seating. In addition, SA's entertainment system was down during the entire 14.5 hours it took to get there; the stewards said that it's often down. I'm sure there are restrictions on what airlines you can use, but a more direct flight schedule would have made the trip a 10/10.The bottom line, though, is trip was even better than we expected! Kudos to all of you at Lion World Travel. We had the time of our lives."

In October 2015 my wife and I took Lion World Travel\u2019s \u201cBest of South Africa \u201c tour with an option to Victoria Falls. Candidly, we have pretty much traveled all over the world and will have to place this trip very close to the top as our best overall experience. With Lion World\u2019s African Specialist Laurandie du Preez professional, efficient, thorough, and extremely patient assistance we planned and embarked on our tour which included Cape Town, a safari in Kapama Game Reserve and Victoria Falls. Beginning with our stay in Cape Town at the Twelve Apostles Hotel and Spa we were treated to a premier facility with exceptional accommodations, restaurants and lounges and a staff that couldn\u2019t do enough for you. The city is beautiful with many attractions to absorb your interest including Table Mountain\u2019s aerial cableway and the awesome sights from the top of the mountain, Seal Island, The Cape of Good Hope the most south-western point of the African Continent, Boulders Beach with its hundreds of penguins, and too many others to list. Of course there are the obligatory shopping areas where you can get all the authentic African souvenirs. The next leg of the trip was the safari. We stayed at the Kapama Southern Camp, and the lodgings were really very nice. The game drives, morning and afternoon, were wonderful in comfortable Land Rovers seating 3 tiers of guests. The guides are rigorous in trying to find the various wild animals and we saw everything with the exception of a leopard\u2026.our bad luck. Each game drive was interrupted for tea, coffee and snacks (morning) and cocktails and snacks (afternoon). Very civilized \uf04a. Our last stop was Victoria Falls. Simply awesome; do not make the trek all the way to South Africa without seeing the falls. Included in this leg were a couple of more game drives and it is here we got to see our fill of elephants. Lots of them; one of which took exception to our being there but it all worked out. We were led to believe that this would be a five star tour and we were not disappointed in ANY aspect."

He seems to be an expert on the country, the National Parks, animal behavior, the climate, and the history of the area. We were very, very impressed with him. If you are heading to Tanzania, you would be doing yourself a favor if you book TeDeus for your driver/guide. As domestic cat breeders and owners, we were most interested in seeing the big cats -- and boy, did we ever!! Our first one was a leopard with his kill up in a tree in Tarangire National Park Subsequently, we saw many lions, including a lion family with babies, a cheetah mother with three big kittens, and a Serval cat. The elephant families were also fantastic. What they say about the \"humanity\" of elephants is quite evident when you sit for a while and watch them. TeDeus was SO patient. He would sit and wait for the animals to exhibit their characteristic behaviors without seeming to want to move on as some guides like to do. Of course, we were snapping pictures every minute. The Ndutu Tented Lodge. It is a marvelous place where we had the best --- the best accommodations, the best interior decor, the best food, the best WiFi, and the nicest personnel !!! (The soups were amazing -- we met the chef and complimented him!!) The solar-paneled hot water tank outside each \"tent\" was most impressive! DO go there. Although some might think it too remote, it was super !!! I came home exhausted. Twelve days on the hop is not my usual routine, but it was the trip of a lifetime. This was my third safari trip, and while each one is VERY special in its own way, this one will stand out as extraordinary."

We normally book vacations on our own, and have very high standards for organized trips/travel agents when we use them. Lion World exceeded our expectations. We took the Best of South Africa trip with Victoria Falls in Luxury added on at the end. I highly recommend this combination (and in the same order - Cape Town, Kruger, Vic Falls).Somehow, Lion World is able to provide 5 & 4 star accommodations (I use that order because they were mainly 5 star) with great activities and extras at an excellent price. Every part of the trip was flawless - every transfer was handled by professionals who knew exactly what to do and were always early, waiting for us.The package included a full day Western Cape tour out of Capetown. There were only 6 of us on the tour and guide was incredible. He had a broad knowledge of the history of South Africa as well as nature and animals. A helicopter ride over the bay was also included - really nice helicopter with leather seats that picked us up at the hotel. Their choice of hotels (such as the 12 Apostles and Michelangelo) are flawless. Kapama Southern Camp in the Kruger area provided high end accommodations, with amazing safari animal drives and fabulous food. Victoria Falls is huge and beautiful. You get your own cabin on the river, surrounded by animals at the River Lodge. We were picked up in a van at the airport and brought to a small private boat that took us to the lodge. Throughout the process, Laurandie, our Lion World agent was helpful and advised us well.

I had gone to Kenya in October 2014 with Lion World and thought that was an incredible trip - but my trip to Tanzania in May 2015 was even better!!! Truly if you can only afford one safari make it Tanzania through Lion World and Leopard Tours - and ask that Ibrahim A. Gege be your guide. The Lion World trip was five star at 3 star prices. Since my friends and I (there were two couples) are older we required aisle seats going and coming, plus rooms close to the main lodges plus 24 hour access to electricity. Laurandie at Lion World made all the arrangements as we requested. I had been in Kenya so I had something with which to compare Tanzania - the people, the landscape and the number/type of animals. I found the people of Tanzania to be warm and outgoing with a wonderful sense of humor. The landscape of Tanzania is extremely diverse. In hours you can go from mountains and woodlands to savannahs, to lakes and marshes. I was in Kenya during the dry season so visually the landscape was pretty bare and somewhat boring. Tanzania at the end of the rainy season was so incredibly lush and green - fields of flowers everywhere. And I did not see a single mosquito or tsetse fly and there was only one day when it really rained late in the afternoon and through the night - so my fears about going during the \"rainy season\" proved totally unfounded. But the really big difference between Kenya and Tanzania is the sheer number of animals- thousands - I do mean thousands - of wildebeest, zebras, buffaloes and impalas in Tanzania. Giraffes and elephants were easily found in large groups everywhere. PLUS WE SAW LIONS IN TREES, LIONS ON ROCKS, LIONS ON THE ROAD, LIONS IN THE GRASS. We also saw a leopard and a very rare caracal. All of the cats were extremely active, not just hiding or laying around sleeping. I have incredible video of hyenas chasing a herd of elephants through the marsh, a zebra rolling in the dirt, wildebeest mating, monkeys - well monkeys being monkeys. Yes, we saw several black rhino and lots of hippos really up close and personal outside the water. And there are the most amazing birds in Tanzania. The Serena hotels in Kenya are very nice, but the Serena hotels in Tanzania are really special. First stop was the converted coffee plantation at Lake Duluti where you sense what Africa was like during colonial times. At the Serena in the Serengeti you truly felt like you are in the bush with frequent bushbaby, dikdik, and mongoose sightings. You actually believed the story that a leopard had been found in a room when someone failed to close and lock their balcony door. From our balcony we watched buffalo, elephants and wildebeest converge on the waterhole below. Finally the Serena at the Crater - we had just started to unpack when we heard this grunting sound. A buffalo was right below our balcony! As an older traveler you always wonder what will happen if there is a medical emergency - this was when Lion World and Leopard Tours displayed their true value. One of my travel companions got a severe case of motion sickness. Our guide, Ibrahim, was extremely compassionate. He gently cared for her and immediately arranged for a wonderful doctor to see her at the lodge; the hotel prepared special meals that were served in her room; she even got a call in the bush the next day from the operation's manager at Lion World making sure she was OK. And the food. In Kenya most of the meals were buffet style with lots of prepared Indian dishes. Nothing really special except at the Serena Camp at Lake Elmenteita. In Tanzania we had a choice of exotic soup (the banana soup was to die for) and entre (a meat, exotic fish or paste dish) at both Lake Duluti and at the Crater - in addition to salads and deserts from the buffet. Plus although buffet style at the Serengeti Serena there were always freshly grilled meats, exotic fish and vegetables. We had lunch by the swimming pool in Tarangire and lunch served on real plates picnic style in the bush by a hippo pool. The only real down side - if you go once you are going to want to go again and again and again."

Then Victoria Falls rooms not as luxurious but the view on the watering hole was rest of hotel great. We had no complaints.Additionally, one of us had an accident and our travel agent followed up contacting us at the luxurious Michaelangelo, wish we had another night there.

We\u2019ve used Lion World before and were very pleased with their services so we had no hesitation going with them again.Our agent was Cheryl Gould and she was superb, with lots of suggestions and advice, even finding us a real time saving in flying direct JFK-JNB and return. We took their Botswana for the Discerning Traveler package and were able to modify it to add extra days, use flights for all inter camp transfers, and added in the Elephant Experience at Stanley\u2019s. When we couldn\u2019t get it on the day we first wanted, Cheryl managed to find a slot on our departure day, changed our flights, and made it happen.The trip was fantastic, words cannot describe how great it was. The service from all the people involved in Africa, from the local agents at JNB that met us, to everyone that took care to see that we got where we needed to be, was excellent. The Melrose hotel overnight, and the camps, were a five star experience.The camps, all part of the Sanctuary operation, were excellent as was the food. It may be the bush but we felt pampered and treated exceptionally for the entire trip.We have no hesitation recommending Lion World to anyone looking to go to Africa."

I cannot explain in words the over-whelming emotions that were experienced every day. The people of Tanzania were very special, including the Masai people that we met.

It is difficult to come up with the words to describe our recent trip to South Africa with Lion World Travel....some that come to mind are jaw-dropping, luxurious, stunning, sacred and unforgettable! On the Cape Town leg of our trip, we stayed at The Twelve Apostles Hotel which had the most incredible scenery (direct view of the ocean), amenities and service we have ever encountered in all of our travels. Every single member of the hotel staff go out of their way to make you feel as though you are the most important guest they have ever had stay with them! The food was incredible (especially the included breakfast buffet each morning) and the attention to every small detail was beyond compare. Our day tours (penguin colony, drive along the Cape coast and wine tour) were hosted by Thomson Holidays who are affiliated with Lion World. The Thomson people (who also operated various of our transfers) were highly professional, well-informed, intelligent and funny....can't say enough about them (thank you Brian and Craig!!). For our safari we stayed at the Lion Sands River Lodge in the Sabi Sands Game Reserve. The accommodations, service and food were unbelievable! And the game drives were stupendous - we saw the \"Big Five\" in no time at all and then some! The skill level of both the rangers and trackers is really quite eerie!! And I never realized HOW up close and personal we would get to all of the animals (including in the pitch dark)! Even more thrilling and moving than I ever imagined. We are still shaking our heads at the incredible trip we had for the price we paid with Lion World. Our research had shown that we would be paying two to three times the amount with other tour companies, so we were a bit leery about what our accommodations etc. would be like but we had NO reason to worry! Every single aspect of this trip was first rate and impeccably organized, from the moment we stepped off of our plane to the moment we boarded to return home. Thanks so much to Laurandie du Preez for all of your help and prompt responses to our endless flurry of questions!!! We will definitely travel with this company again!"

The staff at Kapama Game Reserve were knowledgeable, helpful, and went out of their way to ensure we were seeing the animals and getting the best service and meals. We do suggest that you get the cash you will need on the safari portion of your trip while you are in Cape Town or in the airport prior to going through security in Johannesburg We thought we could get cash once we were comfortably at our gate area or once we landed in Hoedspruit. We learned the hard way that there were no ATMs past security nor in Hoedspruit or at the game reserve so we had no cash to give to our ranger, tracker and lodge staff. We were able to put the tips on our credit card with the lodge but really wanted to hand over our tips in person. We also learned from others who were on the same tour that flying out of JFK caused a lot of delays. We flew from Washington Dulles and had no delays or headaches whatsoever. Others on our tour said they will never fly out of JFK again if there are options to fly from DC."

The safaris were better than we expected and we were thrilled to see all the Big Five animals and more. We learned about everything from the Milky Way to the \"dung\" on the ground!

This year we were going, my dreams were coming to a reality. We booked with Lion World Travel and Laurandie du Perez was our travel agent because our son told us about it. This is the Creme de la Creme travel agency for Safari, the entire trip. Everything was planned, all my questions and concerns answered right up to the last minute as this was our first trip to Africa. We arranged to sleep in the Tree House before we left and this was fabulous. This was only one of the highlights of our trip. There were so many. There are not enough adjectives to describe what we saw. We saw the Big 5 & then some. The rangers and trackers were so knowledgeable.The Lodges that we stayed at were first class, all the way.weather was perfect, food very good. The animals were thrilling, elephants, king lions lion cubs, zebras, wild dogs, hippos, water buffalo, kudos, impalas, leopards,volgers, crocodiles, rhinos, monkeys, colorful birds, eagles. Every animal was more beautiful than the next. My husband was as excited as I was to see all. We both enjoyed this trip and out of all our travels this is definitely the best and most different. The Zoo will never be the same ever, have no desire to go to the zoo. We saw up close in the wild the way animals should be,free to roam. First class trip. People are wonderful in South Africa. All I see since I have been home when I close my eyes are the gorgeous animals that we encountered. If you plan to go to Africa a Safari is a must not just visiting Capetown or other providences, you must go on a Safari & sleep in the Tree house. We were at the River Lodge & Tinga Lodge in Lion Sands Game Reserve in Kruger National PArk. We were in the Kingston Treehouse..Out of this world..fabulous. My husband and I felt like we were on our honeymoon. We are married 49 years. This year we will celebrate our 50th come December. Loved every single minute of this trip. Still can't believe we were in South Africa, unreal.!!!!!!! Thank you Laurandie and Lion World Travel. Maxine and David from California"

Lion World Travel did EVERYTHING for us.... They made everything so easy. We originally heard about the company through Kathy Scott who works there and she completely solidified our decision on going to South Africa. She told us it would be amazing and it really was. She set us up with travel agent Cheryl Gould who was wonderful.....Cheryl planned the entire trip. We were very specific on NOT wanting tours and our entire schedule booked. Cheryl was completely supportive of that but continued to give us plenty of recommendations which we took her up on.... Capetown was beautiful....Table Bay Hotel was gorgeous with a delicious breakfast...Our favorite part of Capetown was our day trip to Stellenbosch where we spent the day in Wine Country. Another highlight was Shark Diving...Our favorite part of the trip by FAR was the safari... We stayed at Jackalberry Lodge and i can't say enough good things about this place.... Atasha and Willie were phenomenal along with the rest of the staff, including Gideon, Godfrey and John. They were some of the nicest people I have EVER met. The food at this lodge was AMAZING. The drives were unbelievable as well.. You can't explain what its like to be in the truck and be that close to these animals... It was definitely the coolest thing either of us have ever done. Finally we flew to Mauritius from Johannesburg and stayed at St. Regis which was also incredible.... I cant say enough good things about our entire trip...We have Lion World Travel to thank for it...I would 100% recommend them for planning a trip....Thankyou again to Cheryl and Kathy for everything....It was definitely \"The honeymoon of a lifetime\""

In November 2014, my husband and I took our honeymoon in South Africa and Mozambique. From the time we decided on this location, Lion World Travel made it easy to organize the honeymoon of a lifetime. Not only were the trip accommodations luxurious, it was an absolute treat to have Lion World Travel plan and book every aspect of our trip for us (this is coming from someone who plans as a profession). From international flight bookings to dinner reservations in Cape Town, Lion World Travel went above and beyond to make sure that our trip flowed seamlessly and was filled with exciting moments and memorable experiences. Even when we wanted to extend part of our trip at the last minute (because it was so amazing that we didn\u2019t want to come home as planned), Lion World Travel was there to help us change our itinerary from across the ocean.In terms of our itinerary, we spent time in Cape Town (where we stayed at Twelve Apostles Hotel), at Kapama Karula Luxury Safari Lodge, and at Dugong Lodge in Vilanculos, Mozambique. All three exceeded our expectations and truly surpass their five-star ratings. The service, food, accommodation, and ambiance at each embodied the epitome of luxury. Highlights in Cape Town included taking a breathtaking helicopter ride and touring the outlying wine regions of Franschhoek and Stellenbosch. Waking up in our ocean-facing room followed by the delicious and decadent breakfast at the 12A was the best way to start the day. We were sad to be leaving Cape Town, but were blown away when we arrived at the luxury camp at Kapama Karula. Our suite was larger than our condo back home in Canada and had views that rivaled those that we had in CPT at the 12A. The attention to detail and level of service at Karula is unprecedented. Karula staff \u2013 especially Sharin, our safari guide Mark and animal tracker Edwin \u2013 went out of their way to make sure we had the best time possible and attended to our every request. The food here is top notch and the twice-daily safari drives were exciting and memorable. We even treated ourselves to a fantastic spa package \u2013 watching animals at the watering hole while getting a deep-tissue massage was really the cherry on top of our amazing time at Kapama Karula. The ambiance of luxury continued when we travelled from South Africa north to Mozambique. If you\u2019ve never contemplated visiting Mozambique, please do yourself a favour and GO! At Dugong Beach Lodge, which has a maximum occupancy of 28 guests, we were treated like royalty. Our chalet even had its own plunge pool the most spectacular views of white sand beaches and turquoise waters. The food was absolutely delicious and the staff catered to our every need. We loved it there so much, we didn\u2019t want to leave!Without the incredible help of Lion World Travel, we would never have experienced such an astonishing, romantic, stress-free, mind-blowing trip. Thank you to the whole Lion World Travel team who truly are the best in organizing luxury African travel. We have already recommended your services to numerous friends!"

Lastly Lion World Tour and Mary Ellen Chown planned an \"trip of a lifetime\" for us.It was absolutely \"seemless\" the entire time..not a glitch. I am sad it is over but met some wonderful people and have lifetime memories.I would recommend this trip and Lion World Tour to everyone. This trip was in my \"bucket list\" and I was blown away with it.Thank You Mary Ellen for all your help !!! Maureen"

But as I reflected on the ease and flow of the trip, I realized that this was not luck, but organization and communication to perfection. Maybe that's why Lion World Travel is award-winning? We were the 'lucky' recipients of an awesome experience -superb food, lodging, service, weather, sightings... And in case you're wondering what animals we saw (courtesy of Abdi, our guide), here is a sampling: a leopard on our first game drive; zebras crossing the Mara with crocodiles taking down three of them; a full pride of lions finishing off a kill; two cheetahs lounging by the side of the road, then surprising and chasing an antelope out of the grass; lions mating \u2013 after which I got to hear my wished-for roar in the wild; a newly-birthed hyrax; a day old gazelle\u2026plus elephants, black and white rhinos, giraffes, hippos and numerous Cape Buffalo, gazelles, etc.Late November is a good time of year to visit - short grass so you can spot the animals, warm temps, a little rain mostly at night and since it's late spring, lots of babies.Have a great trip - we did!"

My husband and I can't thank you enough for arranging our fabulous trip to South Africa and Zimbabwe! \"Platinum South Africa\" really described our experience. Every aspect of the trip met or far exceeded our expectations. The Table Bay Hotel was the perfect place to start our adventure, a beautiful hotel with all the amenities. We loved Lion Sands! We were beyond thrilled to see the big 5 while we were there, and amazed at how close we were to the animals. Our Ranger, Greg, is a photographer and knew just how to position the Land Rover so we could get the best view and photos. One nice thing about going in late November - early December was that we got to see the babies. The leopard and lion cubs were adorable! Tinga was a different but equally wonderful experience. The rooms are exquisite, beautifully appointed including the plunge pool. We were amazed at the ability of our tracker, Chris. We stayed in the Tinyeleti Tree House and had a wonderful experience. Johannesburg exceeded our expectations. The Michelangelo Hotel was spectacular. It was great to walk out of our hotel into Nelson Mandela Square. We enjoyed the people taking pictures with Mandela's statue, the holiday decorations, drinks at the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 and dinner at The Butcher Shop. A memorable evening. The Victoria Falls River Lodge was an absolutely perfect ending to our trip. Talk about exceeding expectations!! The \"tents\" were, again, beautifully furnished and the plunge pool was so inviting! We were incredibly close to the Zambezi River and saw a hippo out of the water right outside our deck. From the moment we were picked up by Simatete, our river guide, until the time we left, the staff and general manager made every effort to make sure each moment was enjoyable and memorable. General Manager Brian Mullins personally took care of our group for our entire stay. We enjoyed both morning and evening cruises on the Zambezi River where we were able to see crocodiles, hippo, a large herd of elephants playing in the water, wart hogs, many, many beautiful birds and a beautiful sunset. Brian led an evening safari and arranged dinner after dark under a 1000+ year old boabab tree. He led our trip to Victoria Falls, making excellent recommendations to go early, just at opening, so we had the entire park to ourselves and the helicopter tour as the only way to get an overall view of the vastness of the falls. We travel internationally quite a lot and I can honestly say that we have never had that kind of personal attention from a property general manager anywhere. We would highly recommend this property! Cheryl, your hard work in getting this all arranged for us, your attention to detail and willingness to coordinate our trip with another couple made it all possible. Your first-hand experience helped to set our expectations and alleviate any concerns we may have had. We appreciate everything you did for us and will be recommending you and Lion World Travel to our friends who are listening to our stories, looking at our pictures and wishing they had gone too! Thank you again for a never-to-be-forgotten experience!"

You tirelessly answered all of my questions, even the silly ones, and made yourself available for me every step of the way from the planning stage, to implementing, to taking off on our adventure. Capetown was beautiful and so much to do! Thank you for setting up our shark cage diving adventure ... wouldn't have missed out on this for anything ... great whites up close! I will admit, even though we talked about safari, absolutely nothing could have prepared me for the sights and sounds we would encounter. I think I spent most of my trip with tears running down my face because I couldn't believe where we were and what we were seeing. Our guides and trackers were AMAZING! We had so much fun interacting and getting to know them and they made sure our trips were \"up close and very personal\" with the animals. We had a leopard come down out of a tree and walk within two feet of our jeep ... yes, I got it all on video! We almost saw a leopard kill a baby impala, but thanks to the thundering sounds of \"run\" coming from our group, the baby lived to see another day. A thirteen year old bull decided he was going to show off and flex his muscle ... it worked, it took me a few minutes to start breathing again! WOW! Also, thank you, Cheryl, for suggesting the tree house adventure ... in my wildest dreams I would have never imaging spending the night out in the bush with the animals in such luxury. I look forward to working with Cheryl again on our next adventure to my new love - Africa!"

We stayed our first night in Kenya in a beautiful hotel with lots of security in Nairobi, then had a 4 hour drive our first Safari Camp at Lake Elmenteita and our first of eleven game drives/photosafaris. On the way to Lake Elmenteita, we stopped for a boat ride on Lake Naivasha to an island where we saw many giraffes. We stayed at Lake Elmenteita two nights, then after a longish drive, got to Maasi Mara National Park and stayed there for three nights. Then a 5 hour drive back to Nairobi for one night. Our last Safari location was in Amboseli National Park where we stayed for two nights. It was a long hot dusty drive to and from, but well worth it. The highlight of our trip were the sheer number of animals that we saw including young lions playing together, two male hippos with their mouths wide open having a \u201ccontest\u201d, the wildebeest kicking up their heels, the wort hog and her baby running across the savanna, the sound of the zebra hooves running (sounded like rain), the zebras braying (like a cross between a donkey bray and a dog bark), and the elephants chasing away a lion pride.The accomodations and the food were excellent. Our driver had a deep knowledge of the animals and was warm and friendly. And the price from Lion World was amazingly reasonable!It's too bad that many people have canceled there trips to Kenya because of the Ebola scare. Kenya is far far away from Western Africa and they have been very careful to ensure that Ebola doesn't not enter into their country. It's safer than the U.S.!"

Mary Ellen at Lion World patiently answered our questions for months prior to our booking. My friend and I had chosen a package through Costco but then added some days on both ends. We started in Cape Town and the tours we opted to take - Peninsula Tour, Winelands, and Walk to Freedom tour - were excellent. We were very interested in the apartheid history and progress since apartheid was abolished and the tour guides were both candid and optimistic. The hotel Mary Ellen recommended, Table Bay, was world class with an amazing breakfast buffet that was included in the package. From there, we headed to Marataba Safari Lodge and wow - what an experience! From excellent trackers and breath taking encounters with the Big 5 animals to the unexpected birthday cake, rose petal strewn bed, and candle lit bath for my friend, and a luxurious outdoor shower for me, just could not have asked for more. The staff was super accommodating to dietary needs and just had a wonderful attitude that exceeded expectations on every level. After safari, we headed to the Oyster Box Hotel in Umhlanga Rocks north of Durban, for some beach time. Again, a great recommendation by Mary Ellen. South Africa is the most amazing country and Lion World did an outstanding job of providing us the trip of a lifetime."

The driver on the full-day tour from Capetown was timely and provided excellent history of each city we visited, making this tour a definite highlight of our entire trip. We loved the walk to the lighthouse at the Cape of Good Hope and had a tasty lunch on the patio overlooking the ocean. The Haut Bay boat ride to seal island was fantastic and beautiful, and seeing all the energetic penguins in Simonstown was amazing. Our driver spotted rare S.

            "review": "Great solo trip to South Africa. Like many others I hadn't heard of LW until I saw their amazing deal on Travel Zoo. I had assumed that a safari would cost me 8 to 10 k, and had no immediate plans to go on one. But when I saw that this 7 night trip was 4k including air, with luxury accommodations, and then saw all the great reviews of LW, I decided to bite the bullet.I loved the accommodations - both More Quarters and Lion Sands river lodge were top notch. Excellent food at the lodge, saw big five and then some. And I must stress how nervous I was about going alone on my first ever Africa trip. But it all came out okay, with just one minor glitch everything was well organized by LW.My only real complaint is that somehow, despite their offer saying transfers were included, I was told I'd have to pay $50 for an arrival transfer because I was the only person arriving on my flight (which I argued shouldn't matter. Transfers should be provided regardless, per the website, but they wouldn't budge). When I found out I could get a transfer for about $33 from More Quarters, I cancelled the LW transfer. Then I find out the others in my group were in fact on my same flight and they got the free arrival transfer. I called this out and the company agreed to refund me the cost of my transfer, so that was good, but still it seemed like a strange error given there were only 5 of us in this group and we were all on the same flight). I did a tour in Peru a couple years ago and the tour guide picked me up personally at the airport, alone, as part of the package price, and that was a far less expensive trip.It also seemed interesting to me that if I had booked a shark cage dive through LW it would have cost more than booking directly with the same company they were using (I emailed the company and got a quote that was lower than LWs). So I booked that on my own; however I should point out the one tour in cape town that I booked through Lion World (they use Thompsons tours) was awesome. I really liked the guide, he was on time and very nice, and I was sorry I didn't use Thompsons for all my excursions in cape town. (I used Ilios travel for a tour on the hotel's recommendation - mistake! The guide was 40 minutes late and a bit of a jerk). My suggestion to LW for solo travelers is to either let the traveler know which dates they have other solos booked, so we have the option of choosing one of those dates, or have trips that are reserved for only solo travelers. I was told there were 2 couples in my group but they turned out to be all in one family. I felt a bit odd at Lion Sands during meal time because I didn't want to eat alone but felt guilty infringing on their time together as a family. (they were lovely and welcoming but I still felt kind of bad). It also might be nice to have more of an organized tour experience with a few planned activities for the group balanced by a couple days at leisure, instead of having us be totally on our own and not meeting each other until safari time. But none of this would stop me from re-booking with LW if the deal was good or recommending them. I shopped around and was shocked at how much more expensive other companies' trips are, not to mention the single supplements! I paid just $500; some companies were charging upwards of $2000 for single supplement. I'm already thinking about where to safari next."

But I saw the offer in the Washington Post (half what similar safaris are advertised as costing) and after checking reviews on Trip Advisor I immediately booked my trip to Kenya with Lion World Travel. I left on Oct. 23 and returned on Oct. 30, 2014. My contract at Lion World was Laurandie du Preez. She was incredible - professional, knowledgable, but most importantly responsive. I have dealt with travel agents before who never returned an email or a phone call. Not Laurandie. No question was too silly to not be answered promptly. She calmed my fears when my friends questioned the wisdom of going to Africa during an ebola outbreak - Just in case you do not know this - they started tracking cases of ebola in 1976 and Kenya has never had a single confirmed case. Kenya is 3000+ miles away from the West African countries experiencing the outbreak. My chances of getting hit by a car in the US were greater than contracting ebola in Kenya. So please do not let unfounded fear prevent you from visiting this truly beautiful country.I spent the first night in Nirobi at the 5 star Serena Hotel. Then two nights at the five star Serena Lake Elementita - permanent tents with marble floors and all the amenities. Finally three nights at the five star Serena Lodge Masai Mara with rooms high on a cliff overlooking a savannah. The food, and there was lots of it, at all of the Serena properties was top notch, as was the service. Hussain with Liberty Travel was the lead guide on this trip. He has been doing this for 16 years. He knows everything about Kenya - its history, its politics, its culture, but most importantly, its animals. He also understands herding a bunch of strangers is like herding cats - some want to sleep late, some what to shop more than see animals, some I have no idea why they ever wanted to come to Kenya? But Hussain handled all our differences with ease. At the end of our time together we all shed tears over it ending way too soon.Transworld Safaris gave us a hot air balloon ride that was to die for - a typical 45 minute trip turned into a 75 minute experience of a life time. Daniel, our captain, landed the balloon 75 feet away from a herd of elephants - now that is mind blowing. You could hear the hooves of the zebra running, watch hippos fighting, be eye to eye with giraffs. During breakfast after the flight, Daniel's wife Joanna and Christopher took us looking for our first lion- AND WE FOUND HIM. He just sauntered right in front of our stopped vehicle while the zebras and gazelles stood frozen behind us.In addition to the hot air balloon we actually took a small skiff out on a lake filled with hippos. Now that is an experience you don't have everyday. During the morning and afternoon game drives we saw tons of babies - lions, giraffes, zebras, whorthogs, gazelles, monkeys, etc., etc. We saw over 30 varieties of animals, plus birds and reptiles.Kenya is a magical place. I wanted to see it before the advances of civilization change it forever. Lion World Travel gave me an affordable, but five star way to accomplish my dream."

Expert drivers and trackers resulted in safari sightings of The Big Five and many more animals in untamed wilderness. We always felt safe in open land cruisers which seated a maximum of 8 people. This holiday was unlike any we have ever had. We know now, why people say, \u201cIt was a trip of a lifetime!\u201d"

            "review": "I highly recommend Lion World Travel!. I just returned from an amazing trip organized by Mary Ellen and Lion World and I can't say enough great things about the planning and the trip. I went with 3 of my girlfriends and between us we had so many questions and Mary Ellen was always prompt and patient with her responses. She always had very good insight and worked hard to make sure that we booked what we wanted. Before we left she continually checked in with us to make sure all our questions were answered.Upon arrival in Kenya, everything was so smooth. It was an incredibly stress-free vacation. I don't think I ever even touched my suitcase, it was in the safari van and then in my room and then back to the safari van. Every detail was thought of and taken care of. We all felt very pampered :)The actual safari was unlike anything I've ever done, it was so incredible! Our guide was beyond amazing, he was so fun and funny and had answers to every single question we asked about Africa, Kenya, animals, culture etc. He also told us great information and kept it really interesting. Even more importantly, he was incredibly respectful of the animals. We saw some safari vans drive off-road (which is illegal) and they would get up into animals faces which felt very invasive to me. I felt like we still saw the animals up-close, but we were respectful of their environment and territory. This was very important to me and I still think we saw almost every single animal very closely (within 10-15 feet).The resorts were all top-notch, beautiful and relaxing. I really dislike staying at any sort of chain hotel because there are so many interesting hotels in this world. I was therefore very impressed with the accommodations, not only were they unique, but they were also luxurious. We got massages at one place, we swam at a couple of the hotels, enjoyed live music and dancing and more. There were so many options and the rooms were wonderful. The staff at each hotel went above and beyond and they were all SO friendly! Overall, I was extremely happy with Lion World and have already recommended them to several friends who I hope will go on safari! It is such an incredible experience and to have it all so organized was such a blessing! I will certainly use this company again in the future....perhaps for a South Africa vacation!"

We were leaving the next day to go to the Christmas Markets along the Danube. Intrigued, I called and Cheryl Gould answered :-) Thus began a great friendship and an amazing trip. Cheryl had me put down a small deposit for my husband and me since we were going out of the country,. We then firmed things up after I returned as the place for us was being held. The trip did sell out quickly Thanks to Cheryl, I extended our trip to include a couple of other lodges. I also emailed a friend of mine and let her know about the trip and she was also on board. Our trip highlights included:Four nights, three days in Cape Town, four nights at the Ivory Tree Lodge, two nights at the Kapama Buffalo Camp and two nights at the Kapama River Lodge. During our stay we: shopped Cape Town; did the Cape Peninsula and Cape Point Circular Route; did a day trip to Cape Agulhas, the Southern most tip of Africa; stayed at the Ivory Tree Lodge and had six game drives; stayed at both the Kapama Buffalo Camp and the River Lodge and had a fabulous time. (Buffalo Camp was our favorite though all were wonderful)Thank you, Cheryl, for walking me through all of the choices and helping me make the correct decisions that were meant for us. Yes, I could have booked South Africa on my own as that is what I usually do, but I would have missed out on so much and it was a seamless, flawless vacation. We moved from place to place and we were well attended to. All of the transfers happened as they should, nothing went right and everything went right:-) I could not have done it without the expert advisor and knowledge of Cheryl and Lion World. If you are thinking about using Lion World and have the opportunity to go to South Africa, don't hesitate. Our trip was such a value and I have the photos to prove it. Thanks again, Cheryl, all of your advise was perfect."

I went on a trip to Cape Town and Pilanesberg National Park through Lion World Travel at the end of August-beginning of September. Lion World did an absolutely fantastic job in organizing the overall vacation including side trips. The level of communication with the company through their representative Cheryl was outstanding. When there was a very small omission on the itinerary I was sent and needed clarification in the middle of the trip, they answered my questions almost immediatly.The trip itself was really great. Cape Town was a lot of fun and we particularly enjoyed the Walk to Freedom Tour. Honestly that was the tour I was on the fence most about, but it turned out to be my favorite thing we did while in town (extremly reflective and moving) . Each of the guides for the city tours were very good. The Commodore Hotel (the group stayed in Cape Town) was nice and we have no complaints with that. For those looking for a place to eat at the Waterfront, I recommend Belthazar's. I went there and had what may be my favorite meal of all-time at Belthazar\u2019s. They had a wild game kabob that was just out of this world.The Ivory Tree Lodge (where the group stayed while visiting Pilanesberg) was also a nice facility. The ranger that we had for the week (Leon) was exceptional\u2026and I\u2019m very picky about such things since I\u2019m in a similar field. We saw so much (but not everything off our list) and had an absolutely fantastic time. The lodge was great and they even went the extra mile by gave me a birthday cake since I was celebrating my birthday while we were there.All in all everything went pretty smoothly. After talking with other couples on the tour (we got to be friends with a few of them) it seemed like they had really great experiences as well and over all we were all very satisfied with the services provided."

Lion World Tours arranged hotels, transfers, international flights, and optional day tours. Hotels were four and five star, living up to their rating. Transfers and tours were very professional and timely. The safari at Ivory Tree Lodge was outstanding - animals galore, a very knowledgeable guide. Less traveled than Kruger which made it even more attractive to us. A trip of a life time. One added benefit, which I hope others do not have to utilize, was that we had to cut our trip short due to a family emergency. Laurandie, our agent at Lion World Tours, handled our new arrangements with efficiency, thoroughness, and compassion that blew me away. She thought of everything including extending our checkout time to allow us to wait for the flight."

From start to finish, Lion World took care of us. This was the first time my husband and I would be visiting Africa, and after having such a wonderful experience, I will only book future trips to Africa with Lion World. I would even book the same package, we loved it so much!Doreen Steenbok took care of us and was kind enough to answer any and all questions we had before and after we booked the package. She answered our emails in a timely fashion and was always patient with us when we bombarded her with questions. Even when Doreen was on vacation, Leeann Phayre-Mallo, answered questions so that we didn't have to wait several days for an answer. Our itinerary, tickets and additional information were mailed to us along with nice luggage tags and a beautiful case to hold passports and documents for the trip. It was a really nice touch.The \"Pride of South Africa\" package we booked made us feel like we were living a life of luxury. We never had to worry about where we were going to go and how we were going to get there - everything was taken care of and laid out for us in the itinerary. The accommodations included in our package were outstanding, and we always felt safe wherever we went. Lion World definitely has great connections with wonderful hotels, tours and such in South Africa. Even the nice little touches - greeting cards and treats upon arrival in Cape Town and safari from Lion World, were so appreciated. Even after our trip, receiving a card in the mail from Lion World, was a really nice gesture to show their appreciation for our business.When we have an opportunity to return to Africa, we will no doubt book with Lion World Tour again. It was an amazing trip, and thanks to this wonderful company, we (to quote them) did come home \"with a lifetime of memories.\""

We worked with Cheryl Gould, who was wonderfully patient as we quizzed her on best dates, weather & such, & we went Feb 24, 2014-March 6, 2014, and couldn't have been happier! From the very get go, our flights on South African Airways were perfect! The weather was divine, 90 degrees average in Cape Town...absolutely gorgeous! The properties were just wonderful (Twelve Apostles in Cape Town & Madikwe Safari Lodge for safari - see my separate reviews for these) We so appreciated the five star quality of both accommodations and the way every single detail was perfectly coordinated! Although we are both very experienced international travelers, as two (shall we say, middle aged ;) women traveling together, we felt so incredibly safe & well taken care of - the service everywhere we went was just terrific! All I can say, is you simply must go!! We are planning another trip back next year for my 20th wedding anniversary, and we're even going to bring my husband along this time :))) It really is the very best way to experience the best of both worlds...Cape Town and a Safari, simply A-M-A-Z-I-N-G and the value can't be beat!"

It was a 7 day trip to Nairobi, upon which you were picked up and taken to Lake Elmenteita and Masai Mara to see the big five...and more. Worked with Lion Travel to secure arrangements and lock in dates. Took the trip, which as it turns out was outsourced to Liberty African Safaris in Kenya. Accommodations were at three Serena hotels, which are extremely nice, upscale, well maintained and provide all the amenities - pool, fitness facility, wi-fi, laundry and more. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were included in the package. With just eleven people in our group, we were given two very good touring vans (that could accommodate 8 each if necessary) with pop-up tops that made viewing extremely safe, easy and fun. Having not gone on such a trip, we were very reluctant at first to sign up, but went to see how it would work out. To our pleasure, the trip turned out to be extremely fun, exciting and memorable. We saw stuff in a week that we could never see elsewhere. To be honest, we had a blast. For a trip like this, you need four things: good weather, accommodations, guide and luck to find the animals. Fortunately, Liberty hit home runs in all three. The Serena hotels we stayed were all top notch. Our driver was extremely aggressive, safety conscious, knowledgeable and likable. He knew everything about the local culture, animals and over 400 birds since he was studying to take people on birding expeditions. The weather cooperated too. During our stay, it was extremely nice, not to cold in the mornings/evenings (low 60s), not too hot in the afternoons (around 80). We saw every animal you could imagine - lions, elephant, rhino, cape buffalo, cheetah, giraffe, crocodile and more close up (some within 10 feet) in their natural habitat. Everyone in our group were completely engaged, fun to be around and easy going. This was without a doubt, the trip of a lifetime. It couldn't have been any better. Every day was like watching Animal Kingdom on TV, with the guide (Peter) answering every question thrown his way. With books close at hand, he would open to the page of our question to provide additional pictures of the bird or animal of discussion. He was a real expert!Our only issue with the trip dealt with Lion World Travel. The trip was scheduled to depart from Washington Dulles. We purchased an add-on flight through Lion World Travel to get from our home to Dulles on the date of departure for the sole purpose of making it a single itinerary. This was communicated very clearly up front to the agent. However, just days before departing, we learned upon checking with the airlines that the domestic itinerary was \"not\" connected to the international leg of the trip, and that baggage fees would be charged. We also found multiple other mistakes. Upon notifying Lion World Travel, the agent did not take responsibility, blaming the airline for problems. Similar problems were noted with seating arrangements, that were fortunately corrected beforehand. We were not at all impressed with Lion World Travel, but were extremely delighted with Liberty Africa Safaris. They went above and beyond to ensure our group stayed at the very best accommodations, saw the big five and more in their natural surroundings, and were driven around with extremely knowledgeable guides, all at a very reasonable price. If you go to Kenya for a safari, ensure Liberty African Safaris is at the other end because they deliver!One final note. Given the recent terrorist incident at the local mall last fall, we were very concerned about our safety in Kenya before departing on the trip, especially around Nairobi. However upon arriving, our fears were set aside given the fact we stayed at hotels that took significant effort to protect us. From going through two security checks at that Nairobi hotel (checked the car upon entering the compound, then everyone passed through a security checkpoint equipped with metal detectors to get into the hotel), along with gates surrounding the two hotels in the wild and constantly revolving security guards, at no time did we feel threatened."

Everything was as billed and much more than we really expected, very fine hotels with great meals. The buffet breakfasts at the Table Bay Hotel in Cape Town and at the Michelangelo in Johannesburg were better than the best fancy Sunday brunches I've ever had. At Tinga Lodge in Kruger we had a suite over 1000 square feet, with its own plunge pool, and wildlife viewing from our own large deck. The game drives were amazing, being in a private enclave within the park with its own road system. We saw everything. Guides were top notch. Staff was gracious. Ok, I'm getting long winded. Sorry.

They even took us to places that were not specifically part of the tours. Great surprises. Our tour vehicles were 9-seaters and were rarely full - everyone had a good view. We were given options of seeing additional sights and were able to stop for photos almost anywhere.The meals included in the trip were FABULOUS: A huge breakfast buffet every morning at The Commodore Hotel in Cape Town; breakfast AND dinner buffets at the Bakubang Lodge with a cook-out after the safari in Pilanesberg, and an authentic S. African \"family style\" dinner at Gold Restaurant In Cape Town with continuous entertainment and wonderful food!The Bakubang Lodge is set within the game preserve and we could see elephants, warthogs, and monkeys cavorting in and around the pond from our seats on the dining patio.All the comforts of home and then some were included in this amazing trip, including the beds being turned down and a chocolate on the pillow. Everywhere we went the people were friendly and helpful.

If you are trying to decide on a tour company to visit Africa, look no further and call Lion World Tours right away!!! My husband and I booked the \"South Africa In Absolute Style\" for our anniversary.

Cheryl and Lion World Tours made our vacation absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! Everything was top notch!! As an anniversary gift, Cheryl even arranged for champagne and wine to be delivered to our room!Jackalberry Lodge had the greatest staff and the most amazing food! We saw the big five and more.

This was our first trip with Lion World Tours and it won't be our last. Incredible value for dollars paid. The entire \"Safari in Absolute Style\" trip was first rate - accommodation, meals, transfers and inclusions. Everything worked like clockwork - just one unfortunate glitch at the end when our departure flight from Madikwe Game Reserve was changed and none of us were told, including our field ranger who took us on a fabulous last-morning game drive with coffee break in the bush. On our return we were greeted with the news that we had to leave in under an hour instead of 3 hours - eat breakfast/freshen up/change/pack/arrange our tips/etc. The lodge staff was able to negotiate an extra half hour for us but it was still a mad scramble and a very unfortunate way to end the trip. I advised Lion World of this on our return to make sure they were aware of it so it doesn't happen to anyone else. They responded promptly and assured me they would be looking into this since it is not in keeping with the way they do things. They are a first class operation and I have no doubt this is the first time this has happened to anyone. We are recommending Lion World to all our friends and can't wait to take another trip through them!"

We took 7 flights in all, had 3 hotels ,many many airport transfers and safaris, most of our meals and a wide variety of tours and experiences. Every flight transfer safari, hotel, and meal was on time and exceptional. I wasn't expecting everything to be such a high quality, but it was. Seriously, the hotels were highly rated and the Kapama Resort where we had our safaris couldn't have been better. I expected to spend three times as much for such a high quality trip. If you are lucky enough to book with Lion Tours you will be guaranteed the trip of a lifetime"

            "review": "Fabulous South Africa tour. A safari was on our bucket list plus our daughter and husband were traveling for 18 months and Africa was on their itinerary. So we wanted to meet them there. I started to research a trip and it was mind boggling. My husband found this tour to South Africa with Victoria Falls add on from Lion World Tours. I was skeptical because I Hate tours with a lot of people. But this was a max of 16 and we didn't have to be with them all the time. This trip ended up being amazing. We had great fun with the few other people who booked the same tour. All the accommodations were 5 star except for the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge., but we loved it. ( no bugs as one person reported). The bathrooms could use some more elbow grease, but i understand they are renovating the rooms. The honeymoon couple upgrade their room and said it was very nice. The reason I like the VFSL was that it was very low key, there was a watering hole, and you felt you were more in the bush than if you would be at the VF Hotel.... For the adventurers if you go in the dry season do the white water rafting... 17 miles of rapids with 3 level 5 rapids and a level 6 which you have to get out and walk your raft around.... Plus hiking down to the rapids and then hiking back up... Not for the faint of heart...In Cape Town we stayed at the Table Bay Hotel on the water. Fabulous hotel, wonderful food, service and great location. We rented a car and drove to the Cape of good hope and the point. Saw wild ostriches and baboons plus the penguins... Great day trip. The people in South Africa couldn't have been nicer. All the tour guides were very informative and helpful. For Safari we stayed at the Jackalberry Lodge in the Thorny Bush Reserve. It was fabulous!!!!!!! The staff was so attentive, food fabulous, safari guide and ranger competent.. What ever animal we wanted to see they found... I am ready to go back...Pat from Lion World Tours was great to work with helping us arrange flts for the 6 family members scattered across the Us, Mexico and Asia. I highly recommend Lion World Tours . They are efficient, helpful and a great value...I would use them again. Thanks Lion World Tours for a memorable South Africa and family trip."

We are not much for \"tours\" or organised holidays but given the vastness of the Continent thought it was appropriate to look to something organised for this trip. Everything was top drawer - the accommodation, the food, the service, and the sights. I cannot say enough about the service throughout in South Africa - a little less than expected in Zimbabwe after The Twelve Apostles in Cape Town and the Madikwe Safari Lodge..Doreen at Lion World was great. If you go to Victoria Falls - check out Lion Encounter - definitely bucket list material!!!"

My wife and I just arrived back from South Africa and Zimbabwe with Lion World Tour's \"Safari in Style\" including the Victoria Falls add-on trip. The trip was outstanding! From start to finish, Lion World Tours and their Agents handled everything seamlessly. We were supposed to go on this trip last year, but because of Family illness, we had to cancel our November 2012 dates. Knowing I had no recourse, Leeann and Mary Ellen still assisted and were terrific in trying to help us rebook at a reasonable cost. GREAT customer service!A few observations on the trip: The 12 Apostles Hotel in Capetown was beautiful. The setting on the ocean with the Table Mountains in the back was stunning. The Hotel is a wedding Mecca for the Capetonians. In the four nights we were there, four separate weddings. Unfortunately, our room (206) was just a few rooms away from the Reception Party venue. After the second night, we thought we were starring in \"The Wedding Crashers\", and let the front desk know. To their credit, they immediately changed us to another room, away from \"wedding central\". The food in the grill, bar (fabulous drinks and view!!), and Azure fine dining restaurant was excellent. Don't miss the breakfast buffet with oysters and to-die-for Cape Seed Bread. We moved from there to the Madikwe Safari Lodge. Spectacular!! Absolutely beautiful individual lodges with a pool in each. Outdoor showers, as well as inside. The personnel were wonderful, helpful and cheery. Our guide was Nicky. She was knowledgeable and great fun. She did a great job in each of the 6 safaris we were on with her in finding photo opportunities of the awesome animals. Next, an overnight in Jo'Burg at the Michelangelo Hotel in Sandton. Gorgeous Hotel! Short Stay. We finished the trip by taking the optional Victoria Falls add-on segment. We opted to pay a little more and stay at The Victoria Falls Hotel, an old British Colonial gem built in 1904, overlooking the Falls. The standard hotel on this segment is the Safari Lodge. Our friends stayed there and were not very impressed. They were visited by small insects that we in the South euphemistically call \"Palmetto Bugs\". All the other properties are terrific. It makes sense to finish in a \"terrific\" property.This trip was and excellent value, offered by very customer centric people: Lion World Tours !!!"

Our stay here was the highlight of our trip. The last adventure took us to the famous Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe where we stayed at another 5 star resort, the Victoria Falls Safari Resort.

Within minutes of calling for info, they're WONDERFUL agent Smruti Smith called me back.

Then ENTIRE trip was FIRST CLASS!! From Smruti's detailed emails, to receiving my Fed-Ex'ed Lion World-marked leather travel case with itinerary (perfect for holding Passports/important documents), to boarding South African Airways, to arriving in Johannesburg and on to Cape Town some 18 hours later and being greeted by professional and courteous tour guides, was just INCREDIBLE!! Lion World really rolls out the red carpet for it's customers. Thanks Smruti for coordinating the trip of a lifetime for me! The hotel (The Commodore - waterfront), the tours (Table Mountain, the wine country, coastal line, Robben Island) and Safari at Krueger were just AWESOME. I met so many wonderful people including a group also from the U.S. -- we ended up hanging out the whole trip and still keep in touch! A year later and I still miss it! I plan to visit SA again soon and will only be traveling one way -- through Lion World! Thanks again Smruti! (jm - Maryland)"

Lion World provided all 5 star lodges, Serena properties, food, and service through Liberty Travel in Kenya. Our driver, Paul, was knowledgeable, patient, and always was on time to give us the best experience. We literally saw thousands of animals, many were up close and personal. Paul knew how to find them. We traveled many rough roads so if you have bad backs, it might be a little difficult. The countryside is interesting and we really enjoyed seeing the native people in their habitats. You would miss this if you were flying from one lodge to another. We felt safe as there is security and fences around all the lodge areas. Our days were spent in the vans so don't think you are going to hang out at a resort. This was not the purpose of this trip. The purpose was to see as much of Kenya and the animals as you could in 6 days. We did and we feel our money was well spent. Thank you, Lion World and Liberty Travel."

We are very thankful for all Andr\u00e9 Steynberg's help and coordination of this great package thru Lion World Tours.In January 2012 my mom, aunt and I took a trip of a lifetime to South Africa.We all agree that it was a top level, high class travel package. We feel so thankful for the great value which Lion World Tours offered and executed so well from Travel Zoo. The two Legacy Hotels (The Commodore Hotel in Cape Town and the Bakubung Bush Lodge in Pilanesburg) were stellar!The carefree days in Cape Town were sunny and warm around 28 degrees Celsius and were most full and rewarding. The down time, (when we were not doing a Lion World Tour itinerary item), we filled with our own little trips to Kirstenbosh Gardens, Robben Island, The Two Oceans Aquarium and shopping and dining the V&A Waterfront. The travel desk at the Commodore Hotel had an outstanding employee, Pia. She helped us arrange this day trips.Some Highlights for us where:\u2022 Commodore Hotel Location, walking distance to the waterfront so we could be creative with the down town and evenings\u2022 My fair Cape tour to see the Penguins at Boulders Beach, Southern Light House and Cape of Good Hope Beaches (with the option which added on a boat ride to Seal Island, and Lunch near Simonstown) were fantastic!\u2022 We love the Cheese and Wine Tasting & Tour at Fairview Vineyards in Stellanbosh / Paarl at http://www.fairview.co.za/\u2022 We enjoyed the morning Table Mountain Cable Car Ride\u2022 The Game Drives from Bakubung Bush Lodge into Pilanesburg Park were great. The guides they had were very knowledgeable and safe. We had one Guide from Bakubung: Peter, which even changed a flat time while on the game drive with efficiency and ease. We saw Rhino, Elephant, Giraffe, Zebra, Gnu, blue wildebeest, snake, chameleon, impala and monkeys. We heard lions roaring, but never made a visual contact.\u2022 We loved the Bakubung Bush Lodge and were so glad we did not stay at Sun City (after we spent a few hours there looking around. It\u2019s too man made for our taste and a little bit like Las Vegas)\u2022 South African Airways \u2013 Wow what an airline! Smooth flights, always arriving early into the airports, lots of food, water and movies/TV shows. Free beer & wine, socks, toothbrush, eyeshade, pillows, and blankets! We think it is the best airline we\u2019ve flown!And finally, to end our trip, we have enclosed a picture of us when we were fortunate enough to do the hot air balloon ride over Pilanesburg National Park thru Air trackers / Game trackers.All the Thompson Tour representatives were prompt, professional, kind and fantastic. Again, thank you for all your and their help. We are extremely satisfied and can\u2019t wait to use Lion World Tours / Thompson\u2019s Tours in the future!Best Regards,The \"P\" family from Connnecticut"

I spent weeks piecing it together on my own and quickly realized that it was not going to be cheap. Between the flights to South Africa, flights within the country, airport transfers, and hotels, I started to worry that we might not be able to afford it. I stumbled across Lion World Tours online one day and sent a request for more information. I was contacted within a day by Andr\u00e9 Steynberg with Lion World Tours and instantly liked him. The package they offered was close to what we wanted, but we wanted some extra time in Cape Town and didn't want some of the tours included in the package. Andr\u00e9 was fantastic and made all of the changes we wanted while still staying at the budget we requested. The total price of the package, which included flights from a location outside of where the package specified, airport transfers, most meals, 5 star hotels, game drives, etc... was significantly lower than what I had been able to find on my own and the lodging was way nicer! I constantly e-mailed Andr\u00e9 with questions all the way up until our departure date and he always responded promptly and never got annoyed.The actual trip was incredible and all of the pieces arranged by Lion World Tours went flawlessly. Every airport transfer was on time, every flight was confirmed, every reservation was outstanding. Our package include the Twelve Apostles Hotel in Cape Town and Jackalberry Lodge in the Thornybush Private Game Reserve. Both are 5 star resorts that lived up to their ratings and when we checked in there was always a hand-written card from Lion World Tours welcoming us. It was so nice not to worry about confirming every last detail of our trip and knowing that Andr\u00e9 and Lion World Tours had it covered. I would highly recommend booking a package through them! My husband and I have already been back on their website trying to decide where our next adventure with Lion World Tours will take us!"

They will also arrange day tours for you as well as packages.I fly a lot in the US, and I thought that South African Airways was superb. The meals, even if they are airline, were very good, and the pacing of snacks throughout the flights was very good. Better than what we are used to. All of our connections had ample time, and all of the flights beat their ETA. Lion World's agent in Cape Town, Thompson's, was very well organized. We normally handle all of our own bookings and plans, so it's been awhile since we've relied on a tour organizer; but the way our tour was organized was obviously well planned. We stayed at More Quarters, on Nicol Street just off Kloof Street, and it was even better than we had seen on the web, or expected. They run a fine operation. The breakfasts were very good. The rooms were excellent. We had a double bedroom, which gave us more room to spread out our luggage, but also enabled us to appreciate the care that went into the room designs. The staff was very helpful for local advice. We had one included tour to Stellenbosch and did the rest of Cape Town ourselves. We booked a private guide for a day to tour the Peninsula and down to the Cape of Good Hope.Transfers and timing to the airport for the flight to Mpumalanga were excellent. The same organization was apparent at the Kruger end. Obviously they do this a lot, but it was still nice to see. The ride to Kruger and Tinga, about 80 Km, an hour and a half, was very scenic and interesting. As for Tinga. in a word, excellent. We have already decided to go back to Kruger, as well as other parks in Africa. However, Tinga was just a fine way to get introduced to Kruger and high-end game lodges. It may have spoiled us. We spent three days there.The rooms were picture perfect, the staff were excellent, the food was superb, and the game drives outstanding. Of course the main contributor to the drives, besides being able to see the animals (and just FYI, on our very 1st drive we were presented with three male lions and their obviously just killed Cape Buffalo, who they were in the process of having for dinner, and all meals for the next three days), was the driver/ranger and spotter. Everyone had nothing but high praise for the guys driving the Rovers and spotting the game. We find it interesting to discuss culture and life with foreigners that we meet overseas and our Ranger was excellent and open to talking about his life and his villages. And beyond that, his knowledge of the park, its animals and birds, plants and ecological system made for very intelligent and educational conversation. Everything about Tinga was first class.We work with Ethne at Lion World who was very helpful, and, as I noted before, on our next trip back to Africa Lion World will be our first stop."

My brother had some time off so we bit the bullet and bought the package to go. We bought the South Africa In Style. Smruti Smith was our agent. She booked all the flights to accommodate our needs and got us into the Table Bay Hotel on the dates we wanted. What a beautiful hotel. We've never been treated so well. It was right on the waterfront, a very safe and lively area & connected directly into the large shopping complex. Concierge helped to book all our activities. Before the trip, Smruti sent over a detailed itinerary in a travel pouch. I couldn't have been more pleased with the whole experience with them. When we were connecting in DC, we had some trouble finding our flight because the airline had listed our flight under the city where we were going to have the technical stop instead of the final destination of Johannesburg. We called Smruti and she did everything she could to help us out. She was always available and easy to contact by phone or email. The airport transfers were smooth - they had our names on a card and picked us up from each airport. The accommodations were lovely as well. The Table Bay Hotel has a classy breakfast, a patio with a view of Table Mountain, and excellent service. It's also walking distance(minutes) from restaurants , shops, bars, and the ferry to Robben Island. For the safari, we stayed at the Jackalberry Lodge. The rangers there were knowledgable and we got to see the big five. The outdoor shower and private game viewing deck was also a plus, especially after the busy days in Capetown. It was the best trip ever ....wine tasting, Robben Island, shopping, Cape Point, safari and shark cage diving. I hope to go back again very soon.

We have extreme confidence that they can make your trip as memorable as ours."
