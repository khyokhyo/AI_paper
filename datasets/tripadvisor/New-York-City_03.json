Although it recounts the terrible day of Sept 11, 2001, it is an unbelievable presentation for the events of that horrible day. It is a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives, as well as the first responders to the tragedy. Plan of spending at least 2 hours to see most of the exhibits. An incredible experience and one I will never forget. Please go and pay your respect to those who lost their lives on that day. Also, marvel at the rebuilding of this site and visit the memorial next to the museum."

He captured and documented history through his pictures. Each image and item in his studio, has a story that really helps you to understand what it was like for those recovery workers, working at Ground Zero in the aftermath of that tragic day in September 2001. We took our children 9 and 12 with us to get an understanding of 9/11 and they were both as interested in everything they saw, as us adults. This museum gives a deep, insight to 9/11, that is accessible to both adults and children. Thank you for a wonderful experience it is truely a really interesting place to visit. We are glad to have experienced it."

It was very emotional and eye opening of the play by play on 9/11. You get to read people's personal stories and see some artifacts that were collected from the rubble. Like I keep saying, it was very emotional, but if you have a moment to stop if I recommend going. It is not very big and only takes about an hour to go through the whole museum."

            "review": "A moving experience. We visited this museum after a trip to the national museum located at the World Trade Centre site. It made an interesting counterpoint to the huge scale of the 9/11 Memorial. This site is a small, single room site documenting one mans - Gary Suson - personal experience of the post 9/11 recovery operation and is no less an impact on the scale of devastation. This is a deeply personal and well told narrative of how the museum curator came to be asked to record the immediate recovery operation at the WTC site. You have to remember the sensitivities that were in place due to the bodies and human remains that had still to be recovered. Added to that, many of the recovery team were involved in searching for members of their own family. Therefore Mr. Suson was given a clear set of protocols to follow while he recorded the ongoing recovery process.As a result, he has put together a very personal and moving tribute to the people who lost their lives as a result of the attack and of those who undertook the recovery operation in what were clearly very trying an demanding circumstances.In the room there are numerous artefacts from the WTC site, found during the recovery process and numerous photographs. However what brings it all together is each part of the display is accompanied by a personal audio description by Mr. Suson which you listen to on the provided device and headphones. It is the use of the headphones which makes the visit so immersive as you listen to the stories behind each picture or item on display. I have to say I was stunned by how absorbing the museum was, the time just disappeared. The concept is different, i.e. being in a single room but that did not distract from the overall experience.One minor detail, if you do visit, it is not immediately easy to find. It is located on W14th Street in Chelsea and there is a small notice above a door but if you get there too early, access to the building is not easy. After 11 when it opens, a sandwich board is set up outside, so easier to find."

            "review": "A Moving and Poignant Experience, Highly Recommended!. This museum is an incredibly special experience. I brought my 15 year old son to this museum last week, who was a tiny baby when 9/11/01 changed New York and so many lives. He normally doesn't love museums or tours, but this one is a different story. When you entire the small space, you realize this is not any ordinary museum. Gary Marlon Suson, the photographer of every photo in the museum, narrates everything in the entire museum through his audio presentations, starting with his introductory video, and then continuing with the audio throughout the museum. With the headphones on you are able to hear him speak about every single thing in the museum, which makes the experience that much more close and interesting. This includes all of his photos, plus many items that he was able to take out of ground zero. An unexpected highlight for me occurred when I wanted to purchase one particular framed photo. There was only one left, so the tour guide made a phone call to make sure it was OK to sell it. She then walked over to me, handed me the phone, and told me that Gary Suson would like to talk to me. After seeing everything he had captured during the year of taking photos, and thinking about all he had been through, I was overcome with emotion and could barely speak. I am glad I found my voice because he was incredibly interesting to speak with, and I enjoyed the opportunity to commend him for the incredible work he had done. He has provided all of us with a chance to mourn, appreciate, understand, and reflect. I was blown away when he told me that he was only 23 years old at the time that he took all of these photos. Wow, a lot for a young adult to experience, and I might add what talent he had at that young age as well. I would recommend bringing tissues. When my son and I left the museum, I asked him, \"What did you think, do you think it was worthwhile?\". He turned to me, gave me a big and much-needed hug, and said that he was so glad I took him to see this museum.A long review, but hopefully worth reading. I could not recommend this museum more."

It is called a workshop because you can actually pick up and touch many of the artifacts recovered from the 9/11 site. It is centered around the recovery efforts of the FDNY as captured through the pictures of Gary Suson. As you walk around the small museum you are able to hear through the Bose noise cancelling headphones a short narration of each of the artifacts and pictures. The stories, facts and pictures give you a once in life time perspective of being involved in the recovery efforts after 9/11 and the stories surrounding those involved in those efforts. I recommend this museum to complement the 9/11 memorial museum."

It is NOT at ground zero, but after we went here, we didn't even feel the need to go to the \"real' ground zero. It is a single room with lots of photographs and artifacts from the ground zero site, including the only piece of airplane that was ever found. Every object has a number, and every visitor gets an audio tour headset. The photographer himself narrates the stories behind each photo and artifact, and so you really get a personal sense of what the years of recovery were like. I lost myself for hours in there, and even my kids (ages 8, 10, and 13) were totally engaged and touched by what they saw and heard. There are some stories that are really heart wrenching, and they have boxes of tissues around if you need them, but I would say overall it is FAR more uplifting of the human spirit than it is depressing or sad. If you want to teach yourself and/or your kids about the power of community, and how healing it can be to work together, then don't miss this museum! You have to make a reservation to go, which makes it hard if you don't plan ahead by a day or two, but this makes the experience WAY better! Instead of feeling jostled or rushed, you are just part of a small group of people, so you can see everything that you want to in a relaxed and thoughtful setting. The docents who work there are amazing, and when we were there, the photographer called in and spoke with us. He really likes to stay in touch with the people who go there, and it was wonderful to speak personally with him after experiencing just a minute fraction of what he experienced. I can't recommend this museum enough!"

The lasting impression Gary's images will have on all of us keep the memory of 9/11 alive. The FDNY (along with all agencies involved) should be proud of how this tragic event was encapsulated for generations to reflect upon. This was a great location, a great exhibit and Gary is a great person!"

Easy to miss walking along the street so do not miss it/ ring the bell/ go up. This personal photographic and audio narrative / chronicle by the photographer Gary Marlon Suson takes you, sometimes painfully, back to where you were, in NYC or anywhere in the world, on 9/11.It is an immediate and compelling and emotional experience made more intense by the small exhibition space. Is this the most moving exhibition in New York? Yes I think so."

It is a small museum but its power does not come from the enormity of its collection but rather from the very personal stories it tells through picture, touch and audio accounts of the photographer creator and the men and women who served in the effort to find the fallen to return them to their families. I cried several times listening to the audio narrative for many of the images displayed here. So if you're not afraid to open yourself to the pain of the losses endured and the dedication and love of those who came after to honor the fallen come here. Few museums will affect you this way."

These words describe the unique experience of visiting the Ground Zero Museum Workshop; an interactive journey that reminds and enlightens visitors about the recovery effort that took place the moment after the towers crumbled. The Manhattan skyline has been transformed since terrorists decimated it with airplane-bombs, but the little Ground Zero Museum Workshop is a big eye-opener to the fact that New Yorkers and other volunteers spent 9 months cleaning up the remains and recovering what was left of their dead. That painstaking process is explained here; in the most eloquently detailed way possible. Younger generations need to know what happened to this vibrant city just 15 years ago. This is a family-friendly museum where people from all over the world learn that Ground Zero was and still is a devastating experience. Even very young children will be able to grasp the concept of recovering after a disaster and how to honor heroes. Tucked into a corner of NYC's meat packing district, this amazing museum needs to be cherished... So make it a part of your kids' educational tour of NYC. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop is a fantastic, interactive way to teach 9/11 to future generations."

This museum has done an excellent job getting to the heart of the matter without showing the gory details. When I have the best parts about this museum is that you must make a reservation so you are only there with a few people at a time. It allows for private reflection and true emotion. It also prevents you with an audio tour like no other I have experienced. Each item number and the man who created the museum tells the story of every single item as you go. You can skip anything that does not interest you but my 8 year old son and I saw and listened to the stories of every item. We were lucky enough to be there when the creator was there as well and he was able to answer questions we had. What a humble and insightful man. This museum is incredibly touching and I will hunt you long after you leave but is more about healing than revisiting the pain. Highly recommended."

I immediately knew this was it. It was the right choice. Visiting the GZMW was one of the most important, worthwhile things I have ever done. The experience was made even more significant due to the fact that Gary Marlon Suson, the photographer, was my tour guide. Listening to him share his very personal experience about 9-11 was more emotionally moving than I expected. The fact that the museum raises and donates funds for the families of the firefighters who lost their lives makes it more poignant. The experience is one that I will never forget, and I would encourage anyone to visit the museum, no matter where in the world you hail from.\u201d"

By the end of our five day vacation all four of us voted it the highlight of our trip!Gary Suson was the only photographer authorized to shoot the aftermath of ground zero, documenting and archiving the effort for the FDNY. He is an amazing photographer, capturing the emotions of the responders with respect and dignity. There's not a single image in the 100+ on exhibit that was distasteful or disrespectful. He's also an amazing curator and host. He and his assistant, Kelsey, spent so much time with our family, explaining the significance of many photos and artifacts. Each of us was moved to tears holding a piece of the American Airlines plane recovered at ground zero, pieces of glass from the tower windows (very rare...all the glass found afterward can fit in a car trunk), and crosses made from the steel girders by iron workers at the site. VERY different experience than the 9/11 Memorial Museum. This was much more intimate and hands on. Gary brings a warmth and perspective and passion that isn't possible in the larger scale of the 9/11 Museum. Please don't miss this! They also donate a portion of their proceeds to the 9/11 Widows Fund! Donate generously, as many micro-museums simply can't keep their doors open without our help!Thank you Gary and Kelsey! NEVER FORGET!!! We certainly won't after experiencing your wonderful museum!"

We visited the Ground Zero Museum Workshop (GZMW) on Friday 1st April and I have to say that I am certain that it was one of the best museums that we visited over our 14 day holiday. This museum is located in the Meat packing District and is very easy to locate.Gary Marlon Suson has created something very special and he should be so proud. When we visited we we lucky enough to have Gary as our guide and listening to him tell his story and those of the recovery workers is something. Susan's work makes it all seem real and personal.Each item has a number that you type into your personal headset, listen to the story behind the item or how the item came to be with Gary. The stories are sometimes simple and other times very moving. One such was about the FDNY brothers who were lost and their father (also FDNY) carrying out their remains. When you first arrive you are given the headset and watch a brief movie on what the museum is trying to achieve - you heard real chatter from FDNY and NYPD when the towers were first struck - so many first responders just headed into danger without any thought of their own personal safety. You are also allowed and encouraged to touch and handle some crosses that were made from World Trade Centre Metal and glass that is rare to locate from the site - they also now have a small piece of the American Airline plane that flew into building 1 for handling.I cannot recommend this Museum enough - please remember to book and consider this a MUST DO when visiting New York. I liked this better than the offical 9/11 Memorial as it more personal and the talk isn't as rehearsed. It is all about remembering and recovery."

The site itself is all brand new and doesn't capture the true impact and emotion of 9/11 whereas this workshop takes you right back to the realities and emotion of what happened that day.The museum is based around the photography skills of Gary Marlon Suson who was the official authorised photographer of the aftermath from 9/11. We were fortunate enough he led the talk describing the events and the power behind his photographs and collated artefacts. Photography capturing emotion is a passion of mine and Gary really is phenomenally talented. Thanks to his talent to true emotion of that day will live forever through his books and photography."

It is filled with photos, and each visitor gets a handset, taps in the number of the photo that is of interest, and hears a brief explanation of the photo, given by the photographer himself. It is a tapestry of pain and hope, highlighting known and unknown stories. I could have stayed there much longer, but at one point it just overwhelms. Highly recommended. We went before going to the 9/11 museum, which is much larger and crowded. I think that is indeed the best way to absorb it all. I have to say that the photos are stuck in my mind ever since the visit, and even though I am very well versed in the events of 9/11, this museum managed to leave its mark on me."

We were also able to handle some pieces of steel and glass from the site which was surreal. Very in depth insight into the events that followed a day nobody will ever forget. You are able to buy some images and books which are unique to the museum. Our visit was made even more special by the arrival of Gary...it was an honour to meet him and hear a couple of his stories first hand plus he also signed our books. Amazing experience.

The 911 workshop museum was much more focused on the recovery after the attack. It captured the spirit, the dedication of the Firemen and the painstaking recovery of the victims of this event. It did this with reverence, respect and care. The photos and stories were amazing. The whole experience was far more intimate. So if you can only attend one place. Come here."

It was very powerful and very educational. The only sad part is that some people there were acting as though it was a fun attraction and taking funny selfies and laughing and carrying on. I saw a husband and wife remembering their lost son there (my wife asked them) during the Thanksgiving holiday, while a group of friends (10 ft from them) were talking a bunch of glamour, funny pics (e.g., like holding up the Tower of Pisa, etc.).

This Ground Zero tour, however, gives a different perspective to the whole event and is most definitely NOT simply a repeat of the 9/11 tours. At WTC you learn about the \"Day of\" experiences and events - at Ground Zero you learn about the 9 months it took to recover evidence and remains. I know, sounds like it would be gruesome, but it is done in such a respectful and UNgruesome way that makes it a beautiful tribute to the efforts of all the agencies involved in the process. The photographs by Gary Suson are placed around the walls for you to visit as you wish - each one has its own narration (you are given an audio headset) by Gary himself of what the photo is about and what was happening at the time. Just a beautiful narration! And this allows you to pace yourself however you see fit. Gary was even at the museum the day we visited, so we got to speak with him personally. It was a very moving experience - don't be fooled by the building fa\u00e7ade - it really is the \"Biggest LITTLE Museum in New York\" -- DEFINITELY A MUST SEE!"

They have set it up in such a professional but heart warming manner. You have to book in advance so make sure you do this. The meat packing district which it is in used to be quite an interesting place to look around but this little areas have now been made into shops and Starbucks. But it is very close to the High Line - which I have also reviewed. Well worth a look especially to reflect on everything you have just taken in in here. In this museum you are given individual headsets to go around and look at the artefacts and memorabilia. Everything is numbered and so you can take your time to absorb what each one says and always go back to them.I would personally say to try visit this museum before you go to the site of 911 to piece it all together."

It made viewing the memorial more private and impactful. When we left the museum 3 hrs later the memorials were packed. We bought timed tickets in advance on their website as friends had warned us about lines. In the morning the point of purchase line moved quickly but when we left that line was long. If you go later in the day the timed tix may be worth it. The museum was well done. But can get crowded. There are artifacts from all 3 sites. And a timeline for all 3 as well. It really brings back memories of that day so be prepared. I certainly welled up a few times esp with some of the audio replays of phone messages. We took our time which is our way.

Located on West 14th Street in what had been photographer Gary Suson's studio, the Ground Zero Museum Workshop is a classic NYC setting - small and intimate - in which to show Suson's extensive collection of photos and artifacts from the World Trade Center site. He began shooting from the roof of this building shortly after the first plane struck, and he continued throughout the months of the extensive clean up and recovery effort, up close and personal to say the least, with the blessing and support of the NYFD. The work offers striking depictions of the chaos and confusion of the debris pile, and of the people who struggled so long and hard to clear the grounds and recover what they could of those who were lost. The focus is largely on the efforts and sacrifices of New York firefighters, so many of whom converged on the sight to search for sons, brothers, fathers, and friends. Many photos depict the respectful removal of remains, and it is clear that Suson had every intention of being respectful in his documentation. The photos and artifacts, helped by the quaint setting, evoke strong feelings from that historical time and place. The official (so to speak) 9/11 Museum and Memorial at the World Trade Center are, obviously, impressive must-see destinations. But to me they offer neither intimacy nor a setting that permits reflection. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop, however, achieves these remarkably well, thanks to Suson's extraordinary work."

Our lack of subway knowledge meant my friend and I turned up half an hour before our tour, however they were very accommodating and we actually got to meet Gary. We booked this museum without knowing much about what to expect so unfortunately didn't realise he was the founder of the museum and the one who took the many photos until after he left. Which luckily for him meant he got away without us bombarding him with questions! The museum was so touching and the way it is set out means it was very intimate (there was only two of us in the museum so it seemed quite personal). All our questions were answered and everyone was super friendly. I would definitely recommend this experience to anyone visiting New York.. it was possibly one of the best attractions we went to. I wish I had taken the opportunity to ask Gary more about his experience!"

The fountains are a stunning tribute to those individuals who died in each tower block. We also saw flowers being placed by the NYPD on the names of those who died from the emergency services. Tuesdays from 4pm are free entry for the museum so we queued a short while for the tickets. We didn't do a guided tour but spent a couple of hours wandering around at our own speed. You could easily spend half a day here reading and seeing everything. A lot to take in and as everyone says it's very moving and makes you realise the huge scale of the tragedy. Especially seeing all the faces of the victims on the wall and some of their personal belongings that were found in the rubble. We thought the whole idea of intertwining the memorial and the museum underground was very clever."

The images are strong and emotive and after an introductory video and talk from a member of staff (who was excellent), you wonder at your own pace and in any order listening to Gary Suson's narration through an audio guide. Gary came down unexpectedly towards the end of the session too which was great. My two boys, aged 17 and 12 really enjoyed (if that's the right word) the museum and were both also very touched by the whole experience. My youngest wasn't even born when 9/11 happened and it felt really important to ensure they both have an appreciation of such a tragic event that impacted on us all across the globe.This museum is very much worth a visit and we all said we preferred this to the less intimate and more impersonal, larger museum experience."

The \"tour guide\" was very excited about his job, knew a lot of information, and kind. After a brief overview he left us to explore and learn all we wanted through the audio guide. I also asked him a couple questions just one-on-one, and he was more than happy to answer my questions fully. I'm grateful he knew so much that he was able to answer. A serene and beautiful look at a tragic day. As they said, it's a place for healing, and it felt like it. I would go back."

He had always encouraged me to visit his museum, and I finally did this past weekend. It far, far exceeded my expectations! The museum is small, but full of incredible photos and artifacts from 9/11 and the recovery efforts. Gary Suson was the only official photographer allowed to photograph the aftermath of 9/11, so his audio tour is developed so each photo and artifact has an interesting story behind it with a lot of very personal elements. I definitely learned a lot of information about 9/11 that I did not know. One of my favorite facts I learned was that the magnitude of the collapse pushed the first 29 floors 80ft underground with floors only 10in apart (I think I quoted that correctly). I also found some of his photos & artifacts to be particularly moving emotionally (i.e. the clock from the South Tower that stopped at 10:02am and 14sec). For the spiritually inclined, I especially love the Bible page that survived that had a lot of symbolism in it (I won't spoil the story for you). I personally think that this small museum in Meatpacking is perhaps more meaningful than visiting the actual memorial site because it tells a lot about the raw experience of 9/11 from many different perspectives. I definitely have a new appreciation that 9/11 is an ongoing tragedy (i.e. due to all the health effects suffered by the first responders along with the intense pain suffered by so many of the victims' loved ones). I am now encouraging all my NYC friends to go and visit this museum. It is very impactful and reminds me never to forget. Even if this is your first visit to NYC, I would definitely prioritize going here. This is tied for my all-time favorite NYC museum (along with the Met and the LES Tenement Museum). If you do go here, buy your tickets ahead of time because they do sell out. You won't regret spending money on this!"

Upon arrival, you're greeting by a theme park style queue. up and down little walk ways until you get to a desk. entrance is a donation style entrance, anything lower than $10 will just get you entry. Anything more than $10 will get you a remembrance wrist band. I bought the wrist band, as I followed the twin towers story none stop when it happened. Once you get past security, you're led on a walk for about 5 minutes, your next stop is an airport style scanner. remove all your belongings then you have to walk another 5 minutes. once you get inside, you're at the site. it's so peaceful as everybody is paying their respects to the thousands that lost their lives. it's got a very weird atmosphere, but breath taking at the same time. well worth a visit."

You watch a short film about 9/11 then you get a phone type thing where you put in the number to listen to whatever photo your looking at on the wall"

It provides detail that is not really expressed elsewhere and enables a close connection to the people affected on 9/11. I think it is worth doing but don't expect anything very grand. The museum is housed in one room on the first floor of a building where the entrance is easy to miss; look out for the small pavement banner sign and anonymous looking entry door. Proceeds go to families affected by the disaster."

He gave everyone in the group time to absorb all the information at their own speed. The audio descriptions of the artefacts were both moving and sensitively set about the room to allow everyone to discover as much or as little as they could take in on the day. It was a very moving experience which we are so pleased we booked by accident!"

Being in Tulsa when it happened we experienced it through the media coverage. I knew that I would visit the Memorial Site during my NYC trip. I read about the GZMW and checked out the reviews posted here on Trip Advisor. I visited the 9/11 Memorial, skipped that museum and headed over to the GZMW. We had a 1pm tour, they don't open early and expect you to be on time. You meet the guide in the street just outside the building, which is in the meat packing district about a ten minute/$10 cab ride from the Memorial site.There was a casually dressed man talking to several people who were just ending their tour. He said goodbye to them and asked if we were there for the Museum Workshop. Turns out he was Gary Suson the Founder and contributor to the GZMW. Gary was the ONLY photographer allowed to document the recovery of the innocent victims of the senseless violence. The focus is on Firefighters,but respects Police and other official volunteers. Trey our official tour guide explained that this workshop is meant for healing.To me the workshop experience , was peaceful and deeply moving. A very well executed display, in a comfortable environment with professional guidance by Trey and luckily for us this day- Gary himself.A unique experience to touch rare artifacts and material from 911.  The focus is on the recovery efforts, through observed personal stories,with extreme respect for the victims their families and the tireless professionals performing grisly duties in terrible conditions. The GZMW contributes to the medical bills of these recovery heroes who have succumbed to illness as a result of their work in a toxic environment. This Museum is a must visit- your ticket supports the GZMW as well as providing support to the health of affected workers and children and widows of NYFD Responders and Recovery workers.Highly recommend."

It is a shame that with all of the space that they have it they did not dedicate more space to showing what happened on the day. If you are interested in the memorials, then go. If you are interested in the history of the event, I would not go. It was disappoint for me."

We enter a room about 60 square feet with a few chairs and couches. There is a brief introduction of what happened that day with several pieces of the building and contents on display. You get a headset and proceed to press the button of the item / picture that you would like to hear about. It is very moving. You forget where you are and take in what went on at Ground Zero and what went on that day. There is also an extensive area given to the period of clean up and the discoveries that they made.

It's at the studio of Gary Suson the only photographer allowed on the site of ground zero in the following months and years after the devastation. On arriving it was a lot smaller than we expected BUT as soon as you're talked through Gary's personal journey it takes 2hrs to get around and is incredibly emotional. You definitely need to book this tour in advance as they only allows a set number of people on the tour, which also adds to the personal touch of this tour. The museum is very well thought out and you are allowed to touch items which is like no other museum I've been too. The experience felt real and very raw hearing Gary's personal experiences through the audio pack, you can go through the audio experiences in any order you like which is great for not intruding other visitors personal space. We were honoured to meet Gary a few hours later at the local church next to the ground zero site, he's so humble and had all the time in the world to speak to us. We also walked past the other 9/11 museum at the site of where the twin towers were but we didn't like the sales people outside that we're wrongly forcing pictures of the towers in our faces and pretending to cry when we said we didn't want to buy a ticket. It felt so wrong and commercial compared to the experience we'd just had at Gary's museum. Overall please don't hesitate to book this tour, you won't regret it."

            "review": "A tribute to the brave NYFD and NYPD and PAPD who had to dig by hand to recover victims remains!. This museum is a collection of photos by the artist appointed to be the official photographer of the NYFD recovery efforts. He was given unlimited access to document the devastation of the attack, and emotional toll the recovery effort took on the teams. These men and women had to dig with hand tools in toxic and compacted debris looking for victims. The museum is intimate and has a collection of amazing photographs documenting the recovery effort. You learn first hand about the Fire Fighters, Police, and EMTs who rushed into this building to save people as everyone was running out, they made the ultimate sacrifice to save others.There are a number of artifacts from the towers, including religious symbols cut from the beams of twisted metal by the iron workers assisting with the recovery effort. None of the artifacts are personal belongings as was stated in an earlier review, as all personal items were returned to families of victims. The artifacts are every day objects and items from the shops, restaurants, and subway station in the towers and are included to show the extent of the devastation from the plane crashes and the subsequent tower collapses.This museum was easy to locate and is clearly indicated in all advertising as not being at the memorial site. I read the reviews of previous visitors that gave this location a poor or terrible rating and can only surmise that they were in a completely different museum than I was in. My wife was bothered by reviewers complaining about the cost of admission, they may have not realized that a large amount of the proceeds are donated to various charities for the fire, police, and emt, and recovery workers who died during the collapse or from illness from the toxic dust of this site.My wife and I visited the 911 Memorial Museum before this one, while I found the memorial museum to be informative and had a large collection it was cold and impersonal, it felt like you were not invited to share the pain of the day. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop was intimate, it included comfortable furniture to sit and contemplate the photos and artifacts, it invited you in to experience first hand the pain someone who was there everyday along side the recovery teams witnessed and lived. It is self directed with a audio commentary from the photographer about each item and photo, you can move from object to object in any order you wish and as fast or as slow as you would like."

It is easy to miss and we were lucky to get there just as a tour was starting (10 people in the tour). After 2 short videos and a brief introduction, you can walk around the room and look at photos taken by the only official photographer allowed on the Ground Zero site, Gary Suson. Each photo is accompanied by an audio story read by M. Suson. We were lucky to meet Gary Suson at the museum that day and to talk with him. Visiting this museum is very touching. It's definitely not a large scale, touristy museum but it is absolutely worth it. I would strongly recommend it. Reviews mentionning the fountains, long lines, tour guides and gift shops do not refer to this museum but probably to the 9/11 museum."

It must, quite literally, be the smallest museum in New York, set in the owner's (and official 9/11 recovery photographer's) old workshop. On arrival, it's hard to find - located a short subway ride away from Ground Zero itself, but is next door to an Aasics store.On arrival it's hard to believe that what you're in is the museum - you are surrounded by photographs and small artefacts, each of which are numbered (see photo). You are given a brief introduction by the guide, shown two short videos and then given time to make your way around, punching in numbers to a headset, to inform you of each artefacts significance. I would advise you leave about 2 hours for the complete visit (you could spend even longer if you wish). This intricate, educational experience is well worth a visit as it tells you things you did not know, about the recovery of the Ground Zero site. You are also allowed to handle certain artefacts, something other museums do not allow. All proceeds go to 9/11 charities. I would advise doing this before visiting the 9/11 memorial at World Trade Center. Enjoy."

My family planned to attend the new museum opening on Memorial Weekend. The taxi driver approached the address at 420 W 14th. There was no signs and no people when we arrived on Saturday May 24, 2014. I called the phone number which went to voicemail. No one called me back. This tour was offered through Viator-All New York Tours which is a legit company. We decided to go to ground zero anyway. No ticket were available until Monday and we were leaving on Sunday. The person in the window said that other people had tried to use these tickets. We did find a museum on a side street which sounded like the same name. It was started by one of the fireman's father and it also had volunteers talking about their experience that day. I got an email asking me to review my experience so I did get my money back."

            "review": "Ground Zero Museum Workshop is an excellent dedication and tribute.... I definitely recommend The Ground Zero Museum Workshop. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop was very, very intimate. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop is one room! Photography is encouraged! Several of the artifacts can be picked up and touched. Despite the \"workshop\" being only one room, you can easily spend several hours there because ALL of the artifacts and pictures there are numbered and you can listen to audio related to each number as many times as you'd like (individual audio players are provided); many times the audio includes recordings of the actual person photographed. I think the best thing about the \"workshop\" is that due to its size, you can scan the room and decide what you want to hear first and in what order; if you want to look at artifact 2 then 17, then 94, then 5, then 80, go for it! There are well over 100 artifacts and photos in the room, each with interesting stories/insight recorded. Finally, because the Ground Zero Museum Workshop work is based on pictures and recollections made by the only photographer with 100% ground zero access, there are some really poignant stories and moments that you don't find at the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Again, both of the museums are thoughtful and impressive, but the Ground Zero Museum Workshop feels more \"real\". Plus, as I understand it, the Ground Zero Museum Workshop annually gives money to various 9/11 victims groups as part of its operation.As well, my family also toured the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum, and the two experiences are vastly different. We didn't feel there were any negatives to speak of either way. But in contrast, the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum was similarly constructed to any other museum that you might visit where it appears money was not any consideration; the exhibit halls are mostly very large and spacious, there are several interactive displays, there are huge pieces of recovered debris, and there are more facts and exhibits (including audio and video) than you could possibly read or spend more than a couple of moments reflecting on unless you have tickets for 2 or 3 days.Again, both museums are impressive in their own right, but if I had to choose, I'd choose the Ground Zero Museum Workshop. Especially, since you can view the World Trade memorial/reflection pools (next to the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum) at no charge."

Despite taking a while to find the place, we were all so impressed with the way in which the workshop is run. The range of materials on display and the incredibly facinating narratives associated with each and every one of them is truly moving.We were expecting that we would struggle to keep the kids interested beyond 30 minutes given their lack of knowledge on the event and the small space, but after 90 minutes we were struggling to move them on as they were so engaged.We were fortunate enough to have a brief chat with Gary - although I am certain that i displayed my ignorance around the technical aspects associated with his photography.

Gary was asked to take photos of the recovery which lasted 9 months.There are so many intimate images of death and love inside ground zero. This is a small workshop, which you are able to touch some of the artefacts and see videos and photos of Ground Zero."

Besides being small, I was a little disappointed by the contents given how enormous this event was for the city. I suppose it would be impossible to capture the event effectively in any space, but left somewhat feeling this was more about the creator of the museum than the event itself. This is effectively a one room apartment with a lot of small artifacts from the World Trade center. I did learn a good amount, the recorded stories are good, and the calendar and clock artifacts are chilling to see in person. Again, just felt a little less about the event and more about the creator."

You get audio devices that allow you to view and listen to the stories behind each of the pictures and you can view at your own pace. They say you have 1 1/2 to 2 hours to view. It is well done presentation. Part of the money paid goes to the 911 family funds.The space is very small, but there is a lot of photos.

Its difficult to rate on tripadvisor sometimes, this attraction is definitely a 9 out of ten, but the tour guide's \"uniform\" made it easier to round down rather than up.The photographs were particularly well shot and the museum gives one a chance to touch and view some artifacts from the recovery.The museum is very small not much bigger than a hotel suite. It focuses on the the photography taken and artifacts collected by the official ground zero recovery photographer Gary. The audio tour and video from Gary gives a good insight into the feelings and strengths of the recovery workers, including some moving moments of those workers who lost family and brother offices. Its reinforced my great respect for these workers both human and K9.The museum is located well away from 911 site, website claims its only 7 minutes away from the 911 memorial, but this only reflects the time of the actual train journey. Unless one is familiar with the subway, allowing for delays and mistakes one should factor in an hour or so. The eateries and bars nearby are pleasant if you are early."

Went for 2 pm \"tour\" on a Monday afternoon - it was snowing heavily but we really didn't have trouble finding it via subway from our hotel in Times Square. Arrived 10 minutes early as instructed after having lunch just down the street. We hit the #3 button to the building but it was hard to hear the voice coming from upstairs. She let us in just as someone else with a key was going in and he advised that we take the stairs up one flight because the elevator was slow.We were greeted at the top of the stairs, hung up our coats on their coat rack, and used the bathroom. We were then given a headset and listened to the introduction by the photographer - who narrated everything - Mr Suson. At around 2, we were seated on the sofas and watched 2 videos on the HUGE tv screen with the lights dimmed - one was a clip of Mr Susone's Good Morning America interview and the other was a narrated slideshow of some of his more famous pictures. I teared up several times during this part - it was very well done.After the videos, our hostess pointed out several things in the museum that she called \"not to be missed\" and encouraged us to touch things and take pictures (no video allowed). We spent the next 1.5 hours taking our time looking at the different pictures and artifacts and listening to the narration. Most of the pictures/artifacts were numbered and you just punched in the corresponding number on your headset. There were a ton of very interesting bits of information about the ground zero site and the recovery/clean up process. The museum is basically Mr Suson's apartment. It is one room but there are so many pictures and artifacts that it was very much so well worth the visit. When we were there (4 of us), there was just one other couple there too. There was just a little bit of redundancy but overall extremely well done."

We are a family of 4 (mom, dad, 18 yr old son and 16 yr old daughter) who lost no one on 9/11, but we all wanted to visit the site, and felt that the workshop could help us appreciate what this tragedy truly meant to the city and its people. It consists of one room, you watch a couple of videos giving you some background info as well as clips of news footage and interviews, then the excellent \"guide\" explains that you can handle and photograph virtually everything you see, as well as listen to an audio guide which is narrated by the official photographer (the only man allowed to take photos, and unsalaried ) The staff are prepared for tears as well as any questions you might have. I would recommend this to everyone - you must go. Some of the stories will move you to tears, artefacts will send a shiver down your spine - there is a clock that stopped the very second the first plane hit - but you will come out feeling uplifted in a way I can't put into words. Truly the best little museum in New York."

While tiny in space, it is packed with photos and exhibits telling the tragedy of 911 and the extraordianry bravery and courage of the first responders. The docent was extremely well versed and presented the information in such a respectful manner, everyone in attendance completed the tour in silence and with reverence. We heard stories and saw items that we had no previous knowledge of before our visit. You have to know about the museum through word of mouth or from a concerege because I did not see a lot of advertisement due to limited funds, but it is very worth the hour and a half it takes to see the entire exhibit."

Learned nothing.......then, we Went to Ground Zero Museum Workshop, the tiny museum in meatpacking district. WOW. big difference...Located in a small commercial business building, tour was hands on ,, got to pick up WTC artifacts (made it more real), see images by the Official Photographer at Ground Zero. The Tour Guide was caring, professional and friendly, explaining so much. We also got a self guided handset with the stories of the remnants & pictures and before we knew it the 2 hours was up. It was most impressing..Avoid the ground zero site and go to this tiny museum if you wish to learn more stories bout what happened at ground zero after the 911... Also some of our money we paid goes to help a disabled firefighter who lost his brother on 9-11. Money well spent. Highly recommend."

We did miss most of the video shown ( totally our fault ) but everyone receives a audio headset with recordings explaining the photographs and artifacts discovered at gound zero. We were lucky enough that the photographer who took what I believe to be the official photos at ground zero during the recovery was at the museum during our visit. He was wonderful about answering our questions and even told us a few stories. His photos are just beautiful and just show the raw emotions of the people who worked tirelessly for months down there.

Most first-time visitors probably get this museum mixed up with the attractions at the actual WTC site, without realising that it's an entirely different experience. You need to seek it out - the entrance is a small door off the street, operated by a buzzer system. No fancy hoardings to guide you. Once inside though it's a revelation. There are so many amazing artefacts that you truly will not see anywhere else and the intimate atmosphere really brings home the tragedy of that day. It's maybe the single experience that will stand out in anyone's trip to NYC."

What Gary shares in his pictures and stories tell the human stories of the tragedy on 9/11. Yes, so many lives were lost on that day but a good portion of the fight is about what occurred after; in trying to rescue, paying respect and honoring those who died.This museum reaches into the hearts and souls of everyone who was there. It conveys how hard the survivors worked at the site, how they also suffered in the rescue attempts.This is a must see for anyone who visits NY and a great prelude to the 9/11 Memorial. I'm also so impressed that proceeds from this Museum Workshop benefit those families. The new 9/11 Memorial won't provide that.

Now pay attention, THIS IS IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LOCATION, uptown from the Memorial, take the subway, it's fine. They ask for a reservation time and actually call you if you're behind a minute or two to confirm you're coming (we hit a late subway, but they waited for us). You go into a small studio apartment room outfitted with objects and pictures from the 9/11 site, there is a very moving video presentation. It is well worth the trip away from the rest of the city , souvenirs are available for purchase. Yes they say you have to leave your bags there, but they are in the same room with you, just can't physically bring them around they don't want you knocking stuff over (its a very fragile room). Pictures are allowed all except 2 items that they will tell you about. Otherwise....very moving and a fantastic time, please go!"

After reading many TripAdvisor reviews, I decided to go to the Ground Zero Museum workshop before going to the 9/11 memorial site.Back home, I'm known as a \"hard nut\" where I do not shed many tears, but after visiting this place, cry I did and it hurt.I came from Australia and wondered what to expect whilst waiting outside the workshop which located in the meat packers district of New York. It is important to note, this Museum is a result of the courageous and wonderful work of a great American, Mr Gary Marlon Suson. It is not located at the 9/11 memorial site and many confuse both places/locations. Please do not take this as a negative. No one should go to New York without paying their respects to this small, humble, yet extremely powerful room. I arrived there after seeing some CNN reports of Gary's work and in the hope, I could meet him and shake his hand.After a gentle walk up stairs, you enter a white painted room with photos hanging. After the small group of guests sit and get comfortable, an introduction is played on a television screen. No graphic vision is provided, but there is vision of the effort of the recovery of efforts together with the 911 phone calls which simply, hurt me. It has been a long time when I have struggled to breathe, in trying to hold back tears that had no choice, but to fall.The staff, young, beautiful and respectful, guide you through the purposes of this workshop, provide you headphones and explain next to each imagine, there is a number which you key it into a recorded to find Gary explaining the background of the particular photo.There is no time pressure, to move along quickly, even though at first I wondered how I could continue to feel the pain I first felt during the introduction. Whether it is due to the relaxed environment, or respect for those lost or Gary's soothing voice explaining the photos, I and I imagine everyone else there, were more than comfortable to remain and reflect on the events of 9/11.To hold a cross cut from the remaining steel of the twin towers, well no words can describe that adequately. A surprise occurred after being there for about 2 hours. Gary arrived to say hello to those still there, even though it troubles him to see his own work, his efforts. Shake his hand I did, I probably broke a couple of his knuckles whilst doing it without realizing, but I am so thankful and blessed to meet this man. A man that has seen so much and done so much for those families who have lost loved ones on that terrible day.I asked Gary to sign a book I purchased to which he asked what comment would he like me to write. There were no words that I could offer other than simply, \"I'll leave it up to you mate.\" He wrote, \"To my Aussie friends, never forget.\"And indeed, I will never forget"

You can leave earlier though. Do not arrive earlier than your ticket time. They won't let you in. We were there five minutes before our tour and we had to wait outside.

It houses a small museum of his photographs and artefacts from the ground zero site. It is remarkably poignant and tells the story of the aftermath of 9/11 in a most remarkable way. Two videos are shown which give background to the stories explained on the walls, we were given headsets to listen to explanations of the exhibits which made this very personal. At the moment there is no museum at the ground zero site so I would definitely recommend a visit here before you visit the 9/11 memorial site. It is in the meat packing district near the high line park (which was great to walk home on). This is a sensitive and very worthwhile museum to visit."

Each time I have made a point of taking them to this museum,( and I will go again and again) The first reaction is to how small the space is ( no bigger than most peoples living room), the artifacts and pictures that surround you make you feel that you are in a time capsule, and transported back to that horrifying day of Sept.11th, you stand transfixed just as you did that day remembering the exact time, where you were, and what you were doing. But you soon realize that what Mr. Suson has done is taken all these pictures, ,images and artifacts and turned this into a place to heal and find peace. Many of the families of those who lost their lives that day come here for that reason. There are no vivid plane hitting the tower pictures that were so dominate everywhere on 9/11, instead Mr. Suson has taken pictures that depict hero's--firefighters, rescue dogs and ordinary people who stepped up that day to help in spite of the devastation happening around them. The artifacts ( many personal ) that belonged to those we lost help us to remember them and their families. The pictures taken by Mr. Suson are a chronicle of all that transpired the months during and after 9/11. This museum evokes emotions, you will feel sadness ( nobody I have ever taken there comes away with dry eyes) and grief, but this is good as without these things healing is not possible. Sept. 11th should never have happened, but it should also not be forgotten.Thanks to Gary Suson and the Ground Zero Museum Workshop he created.WE WILL NEVER FORGET 9/11 Diane K ( from Canada but with her heart in New York) God Bless America and the World may we all live in peace."

Remembering it all so vividly, I was in tears as I walked around (there are discreet boxes of tissues provided) as was my husband.

As a native New Yorker, I worked across a two-lane street from the Twin Towers as they were going up. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop captures in a spell-binding way the human face of the tragedy through dozens of artifacts from the site (virtually all of which can be held by visitors) and the countless short audio stories from those who were there during the terrorist act and its aftermath. While it is moving and very emotional, it really is OK to bring children. Each person brings his or her inner being here, and the few hours spent at the Ground Zero Museum Workshop can be felt at any level regardless of age. We will be going back very soon."

It is not so easy to find right door.There are some photos regarding the job of firemans, some items from WTC like parts of window glasses, parts of floor`s granite, personal belongins of the victims. The tour starts from short movie with pictures, inerviews,sound effects. Probably I was not very impressed because image resolution was poor. Another reason is because I am not originally english speaking and I can`t understand all explanation. The 9/11 memorial is completely different! I was very very impressed! Better to stay there to feel the volume of tragedy instead of visiting museum/ By the way, some items from WTC you can see staying in the cue in ticket office of 9/11 memorial.

My husband and I were in New York City a few days ago to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary, and took the opportunity to visit the Ground Zero Museum Workshop. Gary Marlon Suson has done an amazing job of turning a relatively small space into a huge experience that is tastefully done, incredibly thoughtful, and well worth the price of admission. His photographs, filtered through the lens of his own respect and compassion, capture the day-to-day life of those who worked in \"The Pit.\" He has clearly and lovingly documented their courage, honor and sorrow, as well as their small victories and the kinship they established while shouldering this unenviable task together. The artifacts were meaningful, and there was something truly comforting about being able to hold tangible things -- real things that had survived this disaster -- in my hands. Charlotte, our guide, was friendly, knowledgeable, happy to answer questions, and both wise and circumspect enough to give everyone the amount of space they needed to process their emotional responses to the exhibit. We had the pleasure of meeting Gary Marlon Suson, who just happened to be there on the day we visited. He seemed genuinely glad to have us there, and made himself available to answer questions about his work and his experiences at Ground Zero. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop is a huge positive experience of healing and closure encapsulated in a small physical space. We considered it time and money well spent!"

My biggest complaint is how hard they try to invoke an emotional response from you. It is an emotional experience, it doesn't need to be forced. Also it feels like the girls have given their speech so many times that they are robotic at doing it. Plus their super short shorts seem to take away from their credibility. They just look like college interns passing the time. While I am very glad that the images have been captured and preserved, I think I would have preferred to buy the book and have them to look at again and again. The artifacts are interesting, but nothing spectacular and the fuselage from the TWA flight resting on the floor seems irreverent. Also they make you put your purse on a shelf due to space restraints, tell you that you can see it the whole time, but you can't. Anyone can walk out with your purse as it isn't monitored when you pick up your bag. You could be looking at pictures, someone else can take your purse and be out in New York before you know it."

He was very interesting and unassuming. The photos and the accompanying audio descriptions are extremely well-presented. There are also a lot of artifacts that bring a perspective to this horrible tragedy. Don't miss this one!"

It is unpretentious and unostentatious but delivers far more than you could ever imagine. On first entry into the museum space, it is easy to feel underwhelmed - it is such a tiny space you think that you have made a huge mistake and there is nothing to keep your interest. Think again. This is a memorial and interactive experience like no other. All of the photos and artefacts from the site have their own story and help to paint a wider view of the recovery operation. I was literally moved to tears by the initial video introduction and all four of us were engaged for the entire 2.5 hours. Unforgettable."

Seeing the images and hearing the personal stories represented by the photographs at the workshop museum provided context for my visit to Ground Zero making it much more meaningful. The museum's mission is to promote healing from the the trauma of 911. I found the visit very disturbing because it brought me back to the feelings that I had that day watching the horror unfold: Sorrow for all the innocent lives that were so violently and tragically affected, and an overwhelming feeling that the world is not a safe place. I left feeling very anxious. However uncomfortable it made me though, each victim deserves to be remembered and appreciated. Each hero deserves to be honored. The grief of every person who lost a loved one needs to be recognized. I'm glad that I showed up to do it.  The tour begins with an introductory video. You are then free to take the self guided/headset tour on your own. The museum is just one floor of a row house, but there is a lot to take in if you are interested. It took me a bit over two hours. I was one of the last ones from our tour to leave, so it can be done in less time."

This is the first time I'd visited this museum and also taken the children (14 & 17) where I felt it my duty to give them the opportunity to understand fully what happened on that dreadful day, the human kindness that came out of it and to remember those ordinary people going about there normal lives that were so tragically cut short. The ground zero literature said it was a 5 minute subway ride from ground zero-it isn't. You need to allow at least half an hour. The location could be better signposted but I suppose it isn't , in keeping with the small , quiet museum, that is very understated but immensely hard hitting. It is a fitting tribute and the museum pieces and information are extraordinary. Take your tissues and listen to every single commentary for each artefact.

Purchasing the tickets online was confusing and time-consuming -- why need a password for a one-time purchase? -- but otherwise, it was a fabulous exhibit. It was a rainy day and we wanted to stay downtown and were tired from previous day's walking, so the Ground Zero Museum Workshop seemed like a good idea. After a televised explanation (fortunately, no images of planes hitting buildings!) and a person explaining the various exhibits and artifacts around the room, the interactive workshop was a self-guided tour. Gary Marlon Suson photographed the cleanup of the towers following 9/11 and, spending many months there, also collected many artifacts. Photos and exhibits surround a large room and he has created audio soundbites for each exhibit. Individual audio devices and headphones provided a personal way to be moved, to grieve, to remember, and to be hopeful about the extraordinary efforts of the responders."

I only know it was one of the most moving experiences of my time in NYC. Even more so than visiting Ground Zero....it's just a different experience and amazing how they have so much in such a small space. I didn't want to leave until I had heard everything there was on every artifact and picture. I was one of 7 in our group....the kids finished earlier as kids do but there is an Apple store just down the street to keep them busy. Not everyone was as affected as I was but it did affect each of us none the less. By the time it was all done and I had seen it all, I slipped into the hall and just sobbed. I would recommend this tour to everyone. It is important to see and know all we can about this tragic event in our history."

It honors those that perished at the WTC and it honors those who spent the next nine months trying to recover victims and answers. One small room captures how the horror of 9/11 changed lives forever. This respectful collection chronicles the aftermath. Gary Suson's photos and the collection of artifacts in this museum/workshop connect to the reality of this horrific event and those that labored so arduously to bring closure. As the only photographer allowed take images of the recovery, visitors are privileged to see the gritty, intense nine months at the recovery site.The Times Square Fire Station was right around the corner from my hotel. I revisited the station after going to this museum. Photos of fire fighters who died at the WTC were posted on the wall out side of the station. The station motto is \"We've never missed a performance\". A museum photo depicts a retired fire fighter and a police officer carrying out the flag-draped corpse. The victim, worked at this this station and was the firefighter's son and the brother-in-law of the police officer. One does not need a glitzy, grandiose monument to remember and honor this life changing event."

Looking at Mr. Suson's amazing photos while listening to him tell the story behind them was amazing, and heartbreaking at the same time. Being able to hold a piece of Trade Center steel and window glass was amazing. Seeing artifacts from the site, including glasses from the bar and articles from Windows on the World that were left virtually untouched was eerie. So while this museum may be small in size, it is huge when it comes to a memorial for not only those who were killed, but for the recovery works (both people and K9), who worked tirelessly to recover the remains of those who were lost. This museum is humble, respectful, tasteful and not to be missed.As an added bonus, I had the honor of meeting Mr. Suson on the street as we were leaving the exhibit. He was incredibly gracious and freely gave his time to speak with us, even though he had somewhere to be. It was easy to not only hear, but to also feel the importance this work had for him. Following our tour of the museum, we headed up to Ground Zero for a guided walking tour. The experience would not have been the same if we had not toured the museum first."

I have been to other museums and this was the first time that I have been able to hold and touch artifacts. We all received headsets and a remote to listen to each photographs story. Gary Suson (official photographer at ground zero) narrates each story. Gary actually showed up during our workshop and spoke to many of the people and autographed many items that we could buy. I was walking each item as there were many and the stories of the recovery dogs rocked me to the core. I wanted to thank Gary for telling all the stories that would have other wise stayed silent. They did a wonderful job and the room that started so small became the biggest..I would recommend this workshop to everyone that wants an up close and personal experience....You will not regret it..definitely worth the money!"

Gary M Suson is the photographer that was allowed into ground zero the months following in the recovery. He really got some great pictures and told the story well. They also have items from 911 you can pick up and see. We were also lucky enough to meet Mr. Suson and he is a very nice gentlemen."

Firstly it is in a very fashionable area of New York, and unless you knew the exact number of the property you would definitely struggle to find it. It is a very small entrance door, and then you go up a flight of stairs to a smallish room where you and the rest of the people who have booked the same time slot as you are greeted by two members of staff.When you enter the room, the first thing you see are a number of photographs around the wall. They are images that you feel you have seen many times, but what makes this different is that you are handed an audio headset, and you can hear the story behind each one.The tour starts with two video presentations, and the staff advise that they do not show the planes hitting the World Trade Centre as it is an image that they feel would be too upsetting to the relatives of the victims of the tragedy. We were there for just short of two hours, and I am glad we went. I learnt a little bit more than I knew before, and though there are obviously some really sad stories it is no way depressing.I would recommend if you have the time."

We're from Canada and I wanted to make sure that visiting NYC, my kids came away from our trip with a true understanding of 911. We later went to the memorial site and I didn't want them to just see a memorial but really understand what happened that fateful day. This museum has a nice intimate setting that painted a heartwarming picture for my children about the recovery efforts. Gary's photos and memorabilia were stunning and listening to the stories behind each was helpful to gain an understanding. The only reason I did not rate this a 5/5 was because we also signed up for a tour at ground zero by a person that was connected to 9/11 which was the same price at this workshop and that tour person was amazing and our kids liked that better."

The website describes it as a 2 hour tour, but they showed a video for about 5-10 minutes and talked for another 5-10 minutes. The rest of the time you look around the museum - which is a single small room. Some of the photos have horrible or inspiring stories behind them, but more than anything, I learned that Gary Suson was the official photographer at Ground Zero. I must have heard and read that fact about 2 dozen times. Gary Suson was the official photograhper at Ground Zero. Since this is supposed to be a photo documentation of the recovery efforts, it would have been helpful to have an organized timeline. Maybe if Gary Suson was still giving the \"tour\", it would be worth it - to have that personal account. The young woman who gave the short talk seemed indifferent - like this was just another tour. Did you know that Gary Suson was the official photographer at Ground Zero?"

The set of artifacts is extensive and touching, and the evocative photos and accompanying audio recordings give visitors a sense of the immediate aftermath of the attacks.

These are photographs by a skilled photographer who had the unique privilege of being the only one allowed to take photos during the recovery phase at ground zero. The photos themselves are well worth seeing, especially the vignettes involving people at the site. What is less successful is the rather mundane, amateurish set-up of the room. It is not enough to mount photos on the walls in haphazard order, play dirge-like music, and call it a \" museum\". I also resented the many instances of self promotion, indeed self congratulation, that he slipped into the recorded commentary as he recounted the difficulties he had to overcome in order to get the perfect shot. The ramshackle collection of ephemera housed in showcases around the room has no place in this exhibit: a professional museum curator would have been very helpful in arranging the exhibit and giving focus to the museum. As it now exists, it is partially a photo exhibit, partially a collection of miscellaneous objects, and mostly an exploitive attempt to manipulate emotions. The constant references to religiosity and coincidence are uncalled for and cheap ---totally unnecessary."

The photographer/organizer who has commemorated the stories of those who spent 9 months working on the \"pile\" greeted us and spoke about his experiences as the only photographer allowed on what is considered \"hallowed ground.\" ...An Interesting display movingly recounted through the individual audio devices.

(I had the privilege of visiting on a day that Mr. Suson was there and it was a special treat to meet this very humble and talented man.) Following the introduction, a short video is shown as well as an interview with Mr. Suson that was aired on CNN. The tour guide will then pass around some remnants of Ground Zero. For the remainder of the time you are free to take a self-guided audio tour of the approximately 100 photos in the museum. The English version of the audio is Mr. Suson explaining the photos and their respective stories.This museum is a must-see! The photos depict not only the devastation of Ground Zero but also the brotherhood of the rescue workers. The emotional aspects of this museum experience cannot be put into words and may be different for everyone, however, I guarantee it will be powerful and moving. Do not miss this!Note: The proceeds of this museum are donated to various charities. At the present time, Mr. Suson is saving money to donate to a firefighter who helped with the recovery at Ground Zero and is now battling cancer."

This is a small but very high intensity, high impact museum containing images and artefacts from the 9/11 site and subsequent cleanup. The workshop has been put together by Gary Marlon Suson, the Offical Photographer at Ground Zero for the Uniformed Firefighters Association. It is therefore all real, raw and powerful.Your visit lasts around 2 hours and involves videos, interactive audio headsets and interaction with the staff or Mr Suson himself ( he was there on the afternoon we visited). The pictures are impressive, the audio stories bring a human dimension to the tragedy and the artefacts give a sense of the loss. Given that Suson was trusted by the emergency services his access to individuals and areas on the ground zero site make this a Must Do visit. We visited as a family with three teenagers and they were all totally immersed in the experience.This is not a quick in/ out visit - be prepared for a poignant 2 hours. We turned up on spec and were lucky - you need to book in advance normally.As an aside the area where the museum is located appears to be on the up with designer shops and lots of cafes/ restaurants around."

It provides inside views of the cleanup days and emotion that surrounded the tragic fall of the Twin Towers. In comparison we've been on the Tribute WTC tour that walks the grounds and it is led by volunteers that have a link to victims of the 9/11 tragedy. They have either lost family members or friends or had worked in the buildings. The Tribute WTC tour has a deeper emotional impact of the events of 9/11. While the Ground Zero Museum Workshop offers a lighter storyline presentation and accounts of 9/11 and has a fantastic collection of Ground Zero photographs.I would recommend this for families who have very sensitive members that would benefit from the more \"positive spin\" presentation of the events surrounding 9/11."

It takes you to the heart of the attrocity itself and provides you with a very personal insight, explaining things that you would never have known or understood from a firefighter or police perspective. From first going into the room, it is a 'breath-taking' experience but very sombre. You are provided with headsets and asked to be seated - An informal setting with sofa's, chairs a flat screen TV and tissues! The initial introduction on TV gives you a background to the first calls made by passengers at 10.04hrs. There are audio recordings of original calls made to 911 and people pleading for help. They have made a decision to NOT show footage of the planes colliding with the towers, people jumping from buildings or any body who was injured or killed - a wise move in my own opinion, as the whole experience cannot fail to have an enormous emotional impact of anyone who decides to go - you feel like you're in the middle and part of the whole attrocity. After the audio introduction and short presentation from the guides, you are able to wear the headset and by pressing the number of which ever artefact you are looking at, a commentry and explanation of each item or picture is given. Well thought out, something I would never want to visit twice, but a must if you really want to undertand the impact that 9/11 has had on this country. It leaves you with nothing more than praise and admiration for all of those people who were affected by it - in whatever capacity. Photgraphs can be taken freely, but there are a few area's that you are asked to respect for personal reasons. One thing to note : You are asked to leave all belongings - coats AND bags on a shelf at the entrance of the museum. The area is in the same room and visible, but not an ideal situation if you have valuables with you. A very sad but informative and exceptional experience."

The workshop is a gallery of photos taken by a fireman/photographer of the long months of clearing the site and recovery of all the bodies. It is done very sensitively, but you get the full horror and sadness of their work. Allow two hours. Here in UK we had no idea what followed after Sept 11th apart from the occasional news bulletin. It was touching and also inspiring that people had such dedication to their comrades and people who were lost in the event. We are concerned that this museum will be ignored when the BIG museum is opened at Ground Zero. these photographs must not be missed.

After a short yet emotional DVD you are then left to explore the exhibits at your leisure. Each photograph or artefact has a number assigned to it. To find out more about the photograph you type the corresponding number into the handset and the information is relayed to you through the headphones.The museum captures the real feel of the recovery efforts at Ground Zero following 9/11. At times it can be very emotional but coming from the UK it gave us a better understanding of the suffering that followed in the days after the attack on the World Trade Center.Whilst we were there we were lucky enough to meet Gary Suson, the photographer and owner of the museum. He was very happy to answer any questions we had and even signed our books for us.If I were to recommend just one place to visit whilst in New York then this would be it."

The museum is very small yet rich in information and planned as a healing centre where those empathising with families who lost loved ones or who experienced life changing events on 9/11, can find a safe, respectful place to reflect and remember.This museum visit was an essential start to my 'Ground Zero' day and helped me to gain a greater understanding of the bravery of ordinary citizens of New York.

As expected, it was very emotional, but Gary and his staff have an amazing collection of WTC memories to share with the world. First, the young woman who welcomed us and introduced the museum to us was wonderful. She was full of empathy, and was able to introduce the exhibits with all of the delicacy they required and deserved. Then, to hear Gary tell his stories of each of the photos that he took, and each of the artifacts that he collected...I may not be a New Yorker, but I felt like I was there. Even though this tragedy happened over 10 years ago, the emotion was as raw as if it happened yesterday. I think every American needs to experience this museum. I appreciate everything that Gary and his team had to share with the world, and I think that the NYCFD chose the perfect artist to represent them."

It truly is a moving experience, all in a single room, a video presentation to kick things off, but it is the photos and artifacts with the commentary for each that literally will at times make you cry, feel humble and even the odd smile or laugh. This museum brings everything to life and truly immerses you in the events of Ground Zero. Visiting New York you simply must do this as it is not only a moving but unique experience and gives an insight into the events. Truly amazing, truly loved it!"

Holding artifacts made it all hit home and the stories behind the images by the Official Ground Zero Photographer were compelling & not what I had ever seen on TV before. Had we just gone to the Memorial Pools and bypassed this little Museum in the Meatpacking District I don't think the effect would have been the same. Strongly recommended!!!"

The museum is only in one, small room and so we had to pre book a timeslot to visit (there are currently only 2 tours each day) and there are only 25 people allowed on each tour.The room is full of photographs by Gary Suson (who was appointed the official photographer at Ground Zero after mayor Rudy Giuliani banned all photographers form the site) and is inspired by the Anne Frank museum in Amsterdam. Gary documented the recovery at Ground Zero, 17 hours a day, six days a week for a 14 months. There are hundreds of photos and artefacts, many of which you are encouraged to hold and touch, all of which is designed to bring you closer to the events and people who died that day.The tour is interactive, so as you look at a photo or an object, Gary Suson describes on your Tourmate (audio headset) what you are seeing. It's fascinating and very moving at times. Luckily, a few of the objects are a bit more light-hearted as it can get quite heavy. We were there for the full 2 hours and listened to everything we could. Afterwards we got to briefly meet Gary and pass on our thoughts. It\u2019s a brilliant museum and if you ever visit New York City I recommend you check it out.Note that the museum is not at ground zero but a few miles away in the meatpacking district. Don't get this museum confused with the \"gift shop museum\" that's currently next to ground zero."

There are few really good other museums in NY with free passes and excellent, helpful and knowledgable staff. I ve traveled NY month earlier and was not let in as was not avare of booking policy. This time we ve been in a group and had a chance to visit it for ourselves. I don't like the pilgrimage alike atmosphere, taking into account true facts about 9/11 dismissed in the memorial. And thats a crucial point when you visit historic place of huge tragedy and you are told untrue facts that does not show respect to thouse, who tradicly lost their lifes. Howeverthe photography they display its really nice, but museum its not just about photography it could be as well called Gallery. It all seems too commercial in a way looking at the history of the museum as well seems to me more profit related. I personally think this should be widely open to the public in different form than 'museum' so anyone could be given chance for own reflection. And please museum staff stop sending me bad attitude messages for raising my opinion."

Easily one of the highlights of our trip was a visit to the Ground Zero Museum Workshop. Gary Suson has put together an amazing collection of artifacts from the tragic events of the World Trade Center. It is very tastefully done with the families of the victims kept in mind. I wasn't sure what to expect when I first got there. The museum is unassuming as you are led upstairs into a one room exhibit. A video presentation starts the tour and then you are allowed a self-guided tour of about 100 artifacts, each with it's own story. It's worth it to spend the full 2 hours to make sure you hear every story. I highly recommend this tour to everyone, although young children probably won't understand most of it. My children are 13 & 9. My 13 year old also wanted to hear the stories for every artifact and my 9 year old listened to a few and then decided to sit on the couch and play games on a cell phone. We were lucky enough that Gary was at the museum during our tour. He was gracious and answered many of our questions. The staff were also very kind and helpful.There are a few items for purchase (books, t-shirts, etc...), but understand this is a not for profit operation. Money collected from the tour and purchases goes to support families of the victims."

Firstly this is not I repeat not the 9//11 memorial (former site of twin towers) this is a small museum on 420 west 14th street , meat packing district 3 stops up on subway from 9/11 memorial the former ground zero site. There are no inground fountains here, no wait times, no airport style security checks or names of the victims engraved around the fountains. Some people seem to be leaving reviews for the 9/11 memorial on the Ground Zero Museum workshop, this is a small museum in a former apartment, the photographer Gary Marlon Suson, the official photographer at ground zero, who owns the museum and who's photographs are displayed together with artefacts salvaged from ground zero. Endorsed by the NYFD and some families of the victims. A place to reflect in intimate surroundings, its a private workshop with maybe 15 -20 people allowed on each 2 hour workshop, and with the use of audio headsets the stories of each picture and artefact, some heart moving stories from some of the photos etc. Well worth a visit but must book on the official website, cost $19 per person"

Some people mentioned tacky and gift shop, I find this so far off the mark, profits are donated to 9/11 families and NYFD, they need to sell some gifts etc to keep the place in business, and the images etc are actual real life images, as well as the remnants, not like the t-shirts and photos sold by street hawkers outside the 9/11 memorial, also the museum has been endorsed by NYFD personal as well as families of the victims. We spent two hours in the museum, listing to moving stories and paying our respects to the people who perished.

Mr. Suson, the photographer, was the only person allowed into the site to take recovery photos so most of these pics/artifacts will only be seen here. This is a chance to hear \"real stories\" from responders and to witness both tragic loss but also the love, respect, and selfless care of those who worked from the first moments of 9/11 to those who are working still. We happened to visit on a day that Mr. Suson was actually there-he has received no compensation for his photos rather all proceeds go to the FDNY foundation. This really helped our kids to understand what happened though not a frightening/graphic depiction but rather a very respectful way to honor those people who gave themselves to help others. It is a huge blessing to have this for future generations. **Please note the address as it is not by ground zero but rather in the meat packing district."

The tour walked around the area and the guide had some before 9/11 and post 9/11 photos so you could look at them and then look out at where you were currently standing - whcih was amazing. The museum - which I think has now closed given the new memorial has opened - was fantasic - but again quite difficult as my husband is a paramedic - I cannot even begin to imagine what the families of the lost and missing went through.

The Museum itself has amazing images that we had not seen before, with accompanying audio tour units that tell the story behind the images. Picking up 9-11 artifacts was very special, made us feel a part of the experience more. Cannot recommend this \"Big Little Museum\" enough.

Each visitor is given a personal headset with audio tour by Gary allowing you to walk around the exhibits in your own time and in the order of your choice. This makes the experience unique and personal and is totally absorbing.

PLEASE BE AWARE THIS MUSEUM IS NOT IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE MEMORIAL WATERFALLS, ITS ABOUT A 5 MIN SUB RIDE AWAY.

We walked down on the other side of the road and there is only a small sign outside and this was blocked by a car - was not hard to find at all but maybe a bigger sign would help. We also got there 15 mins early, and although I appreciate it is needed we then had to wait outside in the freezing cold until just gone 11 anyway. However, it is a very interesting place and one I would recommend to everyone - I think they have a good balance of narration and self guide with an audio guide. The guides are on hand if you have any questions and there is a good mix of photos and objects. Obviously Gary Suson was the official photographer for the FDNY and the focus is on this, as this is where he had access to. In my opinion it would have been more interesting to provide more information about other people, but I appreciate this was probably not feasible. I think $25 is pretty reasonable as it is for two hours and is non-profit. Although it is in a very small room it is packed full of interesting photographs and facts and I could have stayed longer, which is more than can be said for many other museums."

This is about the Ground Zero Museum workshop - the amazing little museum in the meatpacking district. I went earlier today and after a short wait in the street,no more than 5 minutes, the group were taken up to a small room about 8-9meters square. It is a tiny museum, but that creates an atmosphere that would be missing i a larger more open surrounding. The 'tour' itself consists of a 30minute video explaining who the photographer is, why he was in the position to take the photos of the recovery work and a little about some of the photos. Then you are introduce to some of the more important artifacts - one in particular (no33) is just incredible. You then have well over an hour to listen to the tourguide (the photographer himself explaining the photos and artifacts on a headset that you wear) as you take your time and study the photos and artifacts for yourself. There were a few stories and photos that almost had me crying, such was the emotion involved. To see things up close, that we have all seen being destroyed on live television in one of the most infamous scenes in history, brings a lot of thoughts to the forefront of the mind. A very moving experience. I was the last person to leave after looking through every one of the exhibits and was lucky enough to meet Gary (the photographer) and thank him on my way out. Then, I felt the need, to slowly walk south, down the banks fof the Hudson river and visit the site itself - even though I had been before. The visit to the Workshop museum left me slightly drained, but also happy. The stories about men digging in the dirt for months on end and their respect for each other and the ground itself and what it contained were amazing. The museum is the perfect size and duration. You are not asked to buy anything, but if you want a photo or card to take away they are available to buy. You are left alone with your thoughts and ideas and allowed to look into the tragedy in your own time. I would highly recommend this museum to anyone - Children might get bored, but I would visit anyway. Go, listen, look and think about what happened."

Deeply moving to view the items and listen to the stories. And very respectful of family members of the victims of 9/11!! The museum was much smaller than I expected, but the experience was out of this world. It was nice that there was a closet to put personal belongings in, so as not to have to carry around during the visit, which made it more enjoyable. Its great the way it is self-guided and you can go at your own pace after the initial introduction. Interesting to hear the individual account of someone who was at the site during the rescue efforts."

The museum as it is known \u2018the biggest, littlest museum\u2019 lived up to its name, I never seen so many interested artefacts and information in such a small space. You could literally spend hours listening and looking at each artefact in great detail and this really helped me personally have a greater understanding on the devastation 9/11 caused the world. Within the museum there is also a little shop which I\u2019d encourage people to buy from as all procedures went towards the museums running costs. A wonderful experience and I\u2019d definitely return again if I were to visit NYC. Well done to the staff and all the people involved in providing such a fantastic museum!"

Note: it is NOT part of the National Ground Zero Exhibit. It is located in the Meat Packing / Designer district of Manhatten...you'll have to do some research to find it. But it is well worth the effort! Upon entering you are given a set of earphones and a brief overview of the history of the museum. Afterwards you are free to roam and use the earphones for a self-guided tour...unlike other museums you can even pick up and touch the actual artifacts! The great thing about this museum is that you hear all of the stories associated with each piece/photograph from people who actually experienced the event. Make note that this museum is located in a room that is only about 1000 square feet in size. However, there is so much to see and take in we needed more than the two hours alloted!!! All of this helped us to better understand what the rescue teams, survivors and the families endured during those first few days, weeks, months and years. It was an incredibly moving experience ... made even more special as our next stop was actually Ground Zero itself."

But don't let its location and size deter you from experiencing this place. Only about 15-20 people can be booked at one time because of the space limitations. I found this to be a good thing. There are places to sit. There are headphones and recorded information about what you're looking at, just like in a big museum. It just feels much more personal here. The young people who check your name off the registration sheet are kind, helpful, and enthusiastic. Many times, the photographer who collected these artifacts and took the photographs will come in and visit. He did so the day we were there. It is my understanding that the GZMW is the idea of the photographer and possibly underwritten financially solely by him. It truly is his labor of love.As a volunteer who worked at Ground Zero for approximately 3 - 4 weeks, the GZMW held the kind of things and showed through photography, what I remember in my mind from my time there. If you think that it can't be that great if it's not a grand place, think again. In the quiet of that 'upper room', there is solitude and reflection accomplished within your own timetable. Don't miss the opportunity to purchase the photographer's book. We bought one and it has been a source of great discussion in our home, especially around the anniversary of 9-11. I highly recommend this little jewel of a place, where you can get lost in remembrance, never forgetting that historic yet fateful day."

            "review": "Worthwhile visit but would appear pricy to some. Glad I went to see the museum but i think it highlighted the different expectations of a UK as opposed to a US visitor. Having read some of the other comments (and responses) I can see that some things which don't seem to be marketing or overly religious to a US citizen seem quite the opposite to a (stereotypically) less pushy and agnostic Brit. For example you would never find reference to the fact that people see angels in the smoke clouds in a UK museum - you would just get the picture and a comment about what was being shown. I appreciate that religion (of whatever kind) was important to the museum's founder and probably many of the workers at the site and the metal cross formed by the girders was a powerful image but I'd have preferred it if the image was left to speak for itself and there was no mention of angels in the commentary. Similarly I suspect some Brits would find narration by the firefighters themselves for some of the photos more informative than having it all provided by the museum's founder. The space works well (although comparisons to the Anne Frank museum are a little stretched as that is much bigger and it draws its main emotional response from being able to visit the actual rooms she lived in rather than the artifacts) and although the museum would benefit form larger premises and space this aspect was fine. Personally I wanted a bit more guiding for my $25 - a brief introduction and video and then an audio tour doesn't equate to value for money in my opinion. I'd also have liked a bit more information about the events of the recovery process - a timeline or simply edited highlights ie. when the first body was found, when the last was found, when the hand searching stopped, what the split of bodies recovered was ie how many civilians, how many police, how many firefighters, how much rubble was removed, what happened to the scrap steel, documentation of how other faiths were built into the healing process (not just christian and jewish) etc. I'd also like to have known which part of the buildings the identifiable bodies belonged to - were the bodies all from the ground floor or were bodies found intact from the higher floors - maybe not what the museum is intended for but it would help my understanding of what happened that day without being too gruesome.I'm not sure what I was expecting but I think the workshop in the title of the museum implies a more interactive element - maybe some computer displays providing more information and the ability to find out about the exhibits that can't be displayed due to space constraints and a bit more detail about what was behind some of the stories. This might help with the comments about there not being much for children to do (as opposed to listen to). I wasn't expecting to see pictures of the planes hitting the towers as I think the promotional material is clear that the museum charts the recovery effort rather than what happened on the day. Hopefully the new museum at the WTC site will explore how and why more fully when it opens.I'd also like a bit more time to be used to explore the issues arising from the exhibits particularly the aftermath of the recovery effort and the lasting impact on those who took part in it. For example I'd like a bit of analysis / feedback about whether it was worth at least an extra 24 deaths to recover the bodies - what are the feelings of the relatives of the recovery workers who have subsequently died ? It might seem obvious that bodies should be recovered but if my husband had been lost that day I wouldn't have wanted anyone risking their life to find his body. Also what support mechanisms have been set up for recovery workers and what has happened to some of the characters in the photos - this could link into the donations made and the positive impact they've had.It would also be useful to have an indication of the total donated to charity somewhere in the exhibit - a running total on the whiteboard which shows individual donations would be helpful. I understand that the museum is a not for profit organisation and that detailed percentages would be difficult to produce but a link to the last annual report and accounts on the website would aid transparency for those who were interested. The Anne Frank Museum has this on its website and all UK charities have to publish their accounts for all to see how much they cost to run and how much of the surplus is donated.Overall though I'm glad I went and some of the stories told were interesting and moving. It does make you appreciate that there was alot of sacrifice after the day and I hadn't realised so many firefighters lost their lives on the day - I'll definitely be trying to find out more about why this happened. UK visitors need to be aware that it is very \"american\" in its presentation - probably a bit sentimental and not objective enough for some UK tastes. What would be great would be to see an amalgamation of this museum and the one at the WTC site when that one opens. That would allow more space to explore the recovery stage fully and show more of the photos."

Seeing the memories pulled from the rubble, seeing the suffering that those people endured. It\u2019s tough. I\u2019m glad to see life rising up from the ashes though, a true testament to our resolve. We had planned on simply doing to the memorial rather than the museum too but so glad we did both. They give military, fire, and police discounts which I think was nice. You would think they would let them in free given the situation, but that\u2019s my opinion. The memorial on the side of the fire hall is captivating. The detail is outstanding. People still lay flowers and candles at the site.

Each exhibit had a number which you entered into the unit and you were given information about the exhibit.I found the stories and pictures heartbreaking.There were pieces of glass,cards,a phone to name but a few items which survived this terrible event.The pictures of the firefighters bringing out the bodies and standing to attention was so sad.The bodies were covered and at no time did you see any of the victims.I would recommend this to anyone who visits New York.It is a personal record of 9/11 and you will be touched by it."

I can't imagine the toll taking all that aftermath in must have been on Mr. Suson but his documentation allows the rest of us to grieve and empathize more with what actually occurred. It was a very somber and moving experience for myself and 3 teenage boys I brought with me. My son is in training to be a firefighter and the tour guide was kind enough to get me the address for Rescue One in Manhattan. We visited there right after the tour and were welcomed so kindly by the firemen there (who sadly lost 11 of their own that day). After your museum and then meeting these men and seeing the firehouse with pictures of those they lost on the walls, it was a very powerful day that gave us new found awe and admiration for the FDNY and all of those involved in coming to the aid of their fellow man without question, even at their own peril. We will never forget the experience."

It's only one room about the size of a living room. Therefore, I'll just say \"what a great attraction!!\" After the events of 9/11, only one photographer, Mr. Gary Suson, was granted the right to photo the recovery efforts. He has taken his photographs along with many other artifacts and created this wonderful room of memories. This is self-guided tour where each photo/artifact has a brief narration by Mr. Suson on the experience or history of that piece. Along with his narrations are actual sounds from the recovery efforts. Mr. Suson has done a wonderful job of creating an experience that is informational and emothional, and, more importantly, one that truly honors those that perished on that day. We were lucky on the day of our visit. Mr. Suson was there and gave us a brief history of his experience and we were able to get to know the man, at least briefly, responsible for this small treasure. The fee is $25. A bit steep at first thought. But then again, he shares a bit of this amount with various organizations. One that is currently helping with medical expenses for a NY firefighter who developed cancer, most likely from his efforts in the recovery.I highly recommend this to anyone!!"

Whilst the \"Ground Zero Museum Workshop\" was interesting, I think it is a bit of a misnomer to call it a museum - it is one very small room with admittedly some very moving photos and artefacts from the site. If you have to choose - I would suggest you go to the 9/11 Memorial instead and make sure you call into St Paul's Chapel - it's become a memorial in it's own right to the firefighters."

After about 30 minutes into the audio tour, listening to what each artifact and photo represented, we were both reduced to tears. The detail, beauty, sacrifice, and unbelievable stories of Mr. Suson - we became humbled and were in true awe. We would highly recommend this for anyone who is not clear on the history of 9-11 or would just appreciate a reminder of our nation's tragedy/strength. This museum may be only one comprised of one room, but it has the impact of the Metropolitan Museum in Central Park. Also, the staff of Ground Zero museum are excellent and helpful."

A place all families and friends of all fallen firefighters should see and experience. However, this place is not for survivors of the other 1500+ who also lost their life that horrific day. The story that is shown reveals a disturbing picture of how firefighters took over ground zero as a shrine and place for their fallen. The absence of stories of everyday people and everyday heroes of 9/11 was heart wrenching. Families of other victims were kept from ground zero while retired firefighters and those firefighters not designated to work the area were allowed free access to ground zero to pray for and seek the remains of their loved ones. The access of the photographer was kept secret from the media until the recovery was complete. Why? The pictures of honor guard ceremonies were said to have been held for all recovered victims but those were left unphotographed, undocumented. You can not help but to feel the pain as you look at photographs of the \u201cBand of Dad\u201d, a group of retired firefighters who had all lost a son on 9/11, searching for their loved one. However, as the curator explains how other families offering to assist were turned away because they were not of this group; you are left with a pit in your stomach as you wonder where they were sent to grieve and pray, robbed of the opportunity to assist in the search."

After introduction speach we had from the lady that worked there, we were shown an interview with Gary Marlon Suson. You could tell that everyone that worked there was very passionate about their job, it wasn't just a pay cheque for them. We had our own head sets and we were given plenty of time to walk around the room and look at the hundreds of interesting things in the room. By typing the corresponding numbers into your headset, you were told a story by Gary about what the picture, object etc meant and why he took the picture or took the object. It was a very emotional place. The museum was set up in a very respectful manner, and wasn't about dwelling on the sadness of 9/11 but rather the recovery and progress made.I could have stayed longer but my friends were ready to go and there was only 2-3 other people left in the room.I was only 12 when 9/11 happened but have always felt very effected by the events of that day, and the museum was a very therapuetic experience for me."

You cannot help but be moved by what you see and the accounts of bravery and grief you will here. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.There is no real time limit for how long you can stay in there however I would say 90mins would allow you to take it all in.

It was a little difficult to find and there was not a banner that showcased the location. luckily, we found it. The two women who were \"tour guides\" were friendly, somber, and polite. We watched a short video and were given a lot of time to view all the different pictures and very moving artifacts. The reason, they explain, for the small space is for a level of intimacy and comfort it brings to fellow surviviors or family members of lost loved ones. It's a cozy and warm place.I met the photographer and was honored to have talked to him. Free chocolate is available in the bathroom and letters from children to the founder are on the wall.A must see in NY!"

I booked this tour before traveling to NYC - thinking it was at the WTC site. it's not - its in the Chelsea area on 14th street - not close to the WTC site. However, it was a good place to go and see many artifacts, pictures and items from the actual site. Be forewarned - you may have a hard time finding the actual place - it does not have a sign outside the door - you just have to find the address. You go to a non descript door and it's up on the 2nd floor. Don't be late to your time - they start a video that you won't want to miss the beginning of. The concept of how they do the \"tour\" is unique - you wear headsets and walk around the room (not a huge room either) and you see pictures, artifacts and other items with numbers on them. You enter the number of the item you want to learn more about and you hear someone telling you the story of that item. It's very imformative and a good place to spend about an hour - but I wish I had known it wasn't anywhere near the WTC site. We were late getting there since we were unfamiliar with where things are in the city. If you have extra time, by all means go. Book online to make it easier on you."

It is an awesome collection of artifacts and photo's from the aftermath of the attack. There are significant stories to each photo and display. When we first entered the room ( the museum/workshop is a small room, yes only ONE room) I was thinking, \"I am so glad I didn't waste my money\". They give you headphones you watch a video and are turned loose to walk around the room and listen to recorded stories ( I believe there are over 50 stories) that match up to the displays and photo's. They say the money goes to help victims and I hope that is true because that would be worth it."

My 13 year old daughter and I visited the Museum on 9/11/11, and we were both very moved and emotional by what we saw there. Gary Suson was thee ONLY photographer allowed to capture the effects of 9/11 on film. He had done a remarkable job with the images he had captured of fire and rescue personnel, priests, Ground Zero, lay people, etc. One has to be at the right place at the right time in order to capture these images, and Gary succeeded. The somber faces of the firefighters who were exasperated having had tried to collect what remains they could of those who perished just made me cry. The artifacts collected from Ground Zero is remarkable! There was a doll that someone had kept in their desk that was completely intact. Bibles were intact. Wineglasses from a bar at the Twin Towers was intact with the charred black tint on it. There were huge pieces of glass from the Towers that used to be the windows. A chuck of one of the planes that hit the Towers is here. The list goes on and on. The Museum doesn't only house photos, it houses personal items that had belonged to those who perished on that tragic day. Having visited the Museum gave me a sense of who was there in the Twin Towers, i.e. mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, wives, husbands, daughters, sons, etc. The Museum is a place for healing. There are candles lit throughout the museum and a box of chocolates for guests to help themselves with because chocolate is known to curb depression and sadness. The Museum also has tissues in various spots because if you're human, you'll need to use them. Although the Museum is small as SP said, it is just the right size.I highly recommend making the Ground Zero Museum Workshop one of your stops when you visit NYC! You won'[t regret it. It'll be a memory engrained forever!"

We pre-booked our tickets via the website weeks before leaving Australia, which I would recommend you do as \"tours\" sell out fast. Initially I was surprised at the size - or lack of it - of the museum, however, we comfortably spent around 2 hours there which is an indication of the number and quality of photographs & artifacts on display. We were fortunate to meet Gary Marlon Suson on our visit & he was perfectly charming. Gary was the only official photographer permitted at Ground Zero during the recovery. Behind each & every object there was an interesting, moving & emotional story - all accessed via a handheld digital device & headphones. After the initial movie and guide presentation, you are free to roam & listen to the wonderful stories at your own pace. As Australians, we had very little appreciation for the magnitude of the recovery operation - it was wonderfully educational. Our teenage children spent the entire time fully engaged (rare at any time - even more especially when touring around with the parents!). I would highly recommend seeing this museum before heading down to the WTC Memorial as it will make your visit all the more meaningful. I can't recommend this venue highly enough."

The opportunity to actually hear (through head phones linked to each picture) the photographer, Gary Suson narrate in his own words where and why he took the pictures during the clean up at Ground Zero left me with such a deeper understanding of what took place. He spoke with passion and concern of what his mission was to express through his pictures.

It was such an unforgettable experience. The images and artifacts that are on display can't be found in any other museum in New York or the world. Visitors are brought into the museum in small groups and are given listening devices. The images and artifacts are numbered so that the listening device can provide you with a story of each item.I found that I preferred this small room with a small group. It made it feel more personal and safe to become emotional. Our group was lucky the day we visited; the photographer, Gary Suson was there and spoke with our group. A portion of the proceeds are donated to 9/11 charities. This museum is definitely something that shouldn't be missed!

This may be housed in a small room but by no means is the experience small, I cannot attempt to comment on the content as I would not do it justice, you have to see it for yourself. We also got to meet the official photographer for ground zero who is behind this project and purchased the official Ground Zero book, please take time to visit."

I was a little worried about this museum and afraid that I would feel a little voyeuristic but this museum is really respectful of the tragic events of September 11th, its victims and friends and family. The photos are poignant and have stories that you can listen to with the headsets along with artefacts from the world trade centre. We watched two short videos to start and then were given time to look around and listen to the stories independently and in our own time. It is a small room and we were told it is used for support groups also and that some of the money made from the photos is given to wives and children of 9/11 victims. I would really recommend a visit here as it is so powerful and informative but incredibly sensitive and respectful."

I thought I was prepared for the emotion and sadness I would feel at being in NY for 911 and our subsequent visit to the Ground Zero Museum Workshop. I wasn't even close. The museum is amazing. From the moment my husband and I walked into the room we were over come with emotion. While watching the introduction (on personal head sets) I suddenly realised I had tears running down my face and looking around the room I wasn't the only one affected by this narrative, tastefully done, by Gary Suson. While only a small room, there is more atmosphere in that one room than in the whole of NY. You get to self pace through every picture or every story you want to know more about. It is an ideal way to spend a a few hours (realistically 1.5 hours of wandering once you have watched the introduction) lost in your own thoughts, remembering the fallen from 911. It was a humbling experience and I am glad we made the time to go. The guides were knowledgeable and friendly. I would highly recommend taking the time to visit. I am so glad we did."

It's a Gary Marlon Suson 9/11 exhibit. This is a room filled with a photographer's work around 9/11. A wonderful photographer, don't get me wrong, and the official one assigned by the FDNY. There's really nothing you'll see in that lone room that you won't find on the site, except the stories behind the photos, some of which indeed are very compelling. They start the two hours with Suson himself--and he was great to hear (although he's usually NOT there; he just happened to be there working on a project). Then they follow it with a grainy CNN VHS video of an interview with him. Then they turn up the lights and a museum worker starts telling us why this museum is so worthwhile. 'We have artifacts no one else has. You'll be able to touch this and this...\" It was marketing at its worst. I already bought the tickets, I don't need to hear you market the museum. Just let me look around.You are given a handset and headphones and each photo or artifact (or group of artifacts) has a number so you can key the number into your handset and hear the recording by Suson of the related information and background. It's fine it's just...maybe we went wanting more? Expecting too much? It left me wishing I could go watch a Brian Williams documentary on 9/11 to really explore the event.The proceeds of the exhibit go to help injured and fallen firefighters and I was glad to spend my money on such a cause. But if you're going for a cathartic experience you may be left wanting; if you're going to see excellent 9/11 photography, then you should leave very satisfied. My only advice for those running the exhibit is...sell it on the site, not in the room. Leave the marketing outside."

This museum workshop requires advanced ticket purchase and limits the number of people attending at a given time, thus making the experience much more intimate. The 9/11 experience is documented with artifacts and pictures (bring a camera as photos are allowed). But the most important part is the story that goes with each piece told by Gary Suson. On the day we visited, he was there to interact with our family and other visitors. This is a must visit museum workshop."

Truly moving, Suson captures not only images but emotions as well. There are no right words to describe what he brings to the memory of 911! Every image, every words shared, items found on the site shared with us, and so much more. He himself is a hero for what he did for the families of 911 and for New York in those 8 months of being in the middle of it all. Quite humble, Suson is truly an amazing man.

It is a short distance away from the World Trade Center site, which is completely under construction. I was not sure what to expect, but wanting my children to understand the worst terrorist attack upon this great country, I signed us up. The experience lasted about 2 hours. You are escorted to a large room covered in artifacts from 9/11. The gentleman who created this was the sole photographer allowed entrance to what was left of the trade center, and many of these images have not been seen before. The introductory video was very touching, you could hear a pin drop in the room. Even my teenage children were glued to the screen. It brought many to tears as we revisited that fateful day. Upon completion of the video, and additional commentary by the host (who was excellent), you were allowed to view the artifacts on your own, and were provided a headset with which to understand the story behind the images. For me, seeing an actual piece of the plane that hit the tower was something I'll never forget. There are many stories behind those artifacts, and this is a \"must see\" for anyone visiting NYC. Thank you, Mr. Souson, for telling this story....especially as we approach the ten year mark."

            "review": "Not a museum. As opposed to being the emotional and moving experience I expected, visiting the Ground Zero Museum Workshop left me feeling confused and uncomfortable. I don't think it can quite call itself a museum, as unlike a museum which aims to inform and educate about an historic event/period the GZMW really just informed me about Mr. Suson and his experience. The staff there did speak of workshops for families of victims of 9/11, so perhaps that's where it gets it's workshop title from, but for an average visit I don't think is is relevant.You enter a small room where you are seated whilst everybody gets handed out headsets and audio tour equipment. The first thing that left me feeling a little uncomfortable was reading a quote printed around the ceiling. Within the quote was written 'Love is the grace and charity shown to us by God' (or something very similar). I don't have any problem whatsoever with religious belief, and if it is comfort to people then so be it, but to have such flagrant religious leanings in a 'museum' stops the experience being inclusive. The 'museum' begins with an introduction by a very professional and earnest guide who speaks about the history of the museum and Gary Suson. There is a little bit of information about 9/11, so I expect more to come when the guide plays the DVD intro. I am mistaken, as the first feature is an interview with Gary Suson and the second a slideshow of images with some audio clips played over the top. Gary Suson really was the main focus, and his Christian belief was the lens through which we were all being forced to look. We heard a story about his struggle to continue photographing when it became emotionally taxing, but how he stumbled upon a bible in the rubble, opened at Genesis 11 with the title of the passage 'The Tower of Babylon' (or something of similar effect, forgive me if I am wrong) and saw this as a sign to keep going. Interpreting events as signs can be of great personal meaning, but if you are creating a museum that is supposed to welcome and educate everybody it is inappropriate; it only serves to distance and disengage people who are not of your belief.The audio accompaniments to the photos were also not what I expected. There was some factual information to tell you about the story behind the photos, but more often than not this was laced with Mr. Suson's emotional reaction. A photo should tell a thousand words, should it not? I don't need Mr. Suson telling me how this sight choked him, or how this brought him to tears. It was distracting from the real focus.It is perfectly fair enough to have an area selling memorabilia items from the exhibition, but I found the large number of autographed postcard size photos distasteful. There are definitely good points about this exhibition: well organised once you are inside, good number of people admitted for the size of the room, a very professional guide and of course some of the photographs are ones you probably won't have encountered before and so are interesting to see. The guide did seem to focus on the 'healing' purpose of the space, but this wasn't particularly relevant to me and there may be other reviews that offer more on this aspect of the GZMW.I would say head to the preview of the new memorial museum that is to open in September 2012 over at Ground Zero and make a $25 (or whatever amount you can afford) donation there instead. I implore Mr. Suson to listen to the criticism people have to offer on trip advisor, as there are some good photographs that are being overshadowed by the 'museum' experience."

My kids were young during the 9/11 attacks but have seen news reports but this was amazing. We were able to get a first hand account of the aftermath in a tasteful way. We stayed for the whole 2 hours and my kids were never bored. They thought this was great!!!

We visited the museum after reading about it on Trip Advisor, therefore we weren't surprised at how small it was, but we were very surprised that it was located in the pricey/trendy meat-packing district, just down the street from Mr. Chow and across and next door to several couture clothing boutiques. In hindsight, maybe that should have been a sign. Hear me out...This hands-on memorial does pack a lot of punch into a tiny little space. And at $25 a ticket, as well it should. There were a lot of things to look at, listen to, and touch, but nothing that would warrant staying over the two-hour time limit allotted with your ticket purchase. The MOMA, on the other hand, charges $20/person and you wouldn't be able to see everything in one day if you tried. I can't help but wonder if the ticket price would be a little more reasonable if the museum wasn't in such a high-rent locale, but that's just me. It was definitely never made clear exactly how much of the profit from ticket sales goes to 9/11 victims.When you enter the museum (and you cannot enter prior to your ticket time), you are accompanied up some narrow stairs to a room the size of a small studio apartment. It did feel a bit crowded, even though there were only 12 people total in our group, plus 2 Workshop employees. After a brief video is played on a big-screen tv, with a voice-over by Mr. Suson, you are provided with hand-held listening devices and allowed to peruse the museum at your leisure. The photographs in the museum are all stunning, and Mr. Suson is obviously a very talented photographer; many of the photographs you will have seen before, but some of them have not been as widely published, and a good majority of them are accompanied by a recording you can listen to on your hand-held device, giving information about the who/what/when/where involving the item you're viewing. It was hard not to be moved by seeing and touching things that had been salvaged from the wreckage of 9/11.Aside from the high ticket price and the tiny space in which the museum is housed, we left the Workshop not with disappointment about its contents, but rather the feeling that the museum was set up more for the self-promotion of Mr. Suson's work than anything else. For all I know, he may donate 100% of the proceeds to the victim families (unlikely, since the amount seems to be something never specified on the site or by the employees when asked), and that might make me feel a little differently. At the beginning of the tour, the guide speaks for about five minutes about how wonderful Mr. Suson is, how renowned his work is, how exceptional he is in that he was the only one allowed in to photograph the aftermath...which is fine, but then a video is shown with scenes from the aftermath, in Mr. Suson's own voice, which says pretty much the same thing about his great abilities, experience, and privilege; to top it off, all of the recordings on the interactive exhibits are also in Mr. Suson's voice. For our entire party, it lent a pretentious feel to the entire experience. We would have preferred to be moved by reflections of the experience of victims, their families, of those who lived and worked in NYC at the time, as opposed to the majority of the focus being on Mr. Suson's own personal experience (there were, admittedly, a few personal stories - told by Mr. Suson - about the experiences of others...but not many). I also have to wonder about the TripAdvisor rating, because the employees very heavily pushed visitors to leave feedback on the site, going as far as to hand out strips of paper asking for reviews and mentioning the review process several times during our visit.We didn't come away feeling like our time was wasted, but we definitely walked out of the Workshop wondering if there would have been a better way to pay tribute to the victims of 9/11 and to learn about the aftermath. We will be coming back to NYC once the 9/11 Memorial is open, and urge others to also visit and make donations to charities willing to document the relief provided by those who give."

The significance of the day was not lost in the realization of how many lives were impacted on that one day and forever more! Gary Marlon Suson tells this story through the lens of his camera and his heartfelt words. If you did not experience this day, as our grandchildren did not, on 9/11/01 this museum is a teaching tool. It is a gentle way to show our future generations what their forefathers endured and triumphed over. It is our responsibility to pass this information on in a respectful and factual manner. This museum does that and opens the door for conversation with your young ones about this event in our history that changed everything. LET US NEVER FORGET!"

My conclusion after visiting the Museum is that while it is a worthwhile attraction, if I had to do it all over again I probably would have spent the time elsewhere or at another attraction. The photos are beautiful and the artifacts that are on display are very interesting but the Museum is basically a small room on the second floor of a loft in the Meatpacking Dist. in a building that is undergoing renovation (we had to walk around construction workers and mounds of drywall). It gets a bit cramped in the room trying to take the audio tour and take pictures. Again, I would say that visiting it is a worthwhile venture but just understand what you will encounter."

Although not a big display everything is captured in a single room which makes it easy to manouver around and keep check on what you have already seen. There is a very informative explanation given on each artifact over your headset. Also the crowds for each tour are just about right so it is easy to move throughout the visit.An added bonus was Mr Suson being present on this day. We got to listen to him at the start of the tour as the BBC were there doing some filming on the museum.Would recommend this to anyone who wanted to escape the hustle and bustle of New York City for a couple of hours. You will leave a better person for your experience."

The quaint, one room museum can show, teach, inspire and heal in a way that no other museum, documentary or book can ever do. We had the fotune of meeting Mr. Suson at the museum that day. His humbleness and sincerity in describing his role in creating this museum reflects itself in the presentation of the horrors of 9/11 and the spirit of the heroes who worked in \"the pit\". Much of what you see and hear in the museum is heart-wrenching, and you will surely be brought to tears the same as we were. Most importantly, upon leaving our 2 hour experience, I want to convey what Mr. Suson and the many firefighters who grew to respect him and gave him the honor of standing by their sides as they searched for their brothers and civilian victims,that is the love that it took to complete their mission. And surely, you shall leave this AMAZING museum warmed with the love that Mr. Suson's work, care and humility has created. Thank you Gary Suson, NYPD, FDNY, PAPD and all of the iron workers, laborers, etc for allowing these images and stories to be shared with us who did not and could not do what you did to help us heal. PLAN YOUR TRIP TO NYC CENTERED AROUND EXPERIENCING THIS MUSEUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I thought that it would be at Ground Zero and was surprised it was in another part of town. They only allow 20? people and it's a small quant room but the impact of these exhibits blew me away. The day we were there Mr. Suson, the Ground Zero photographer was there to autograph photos and get a photo of him and my granddaughters. The work he has done is just incredible as he truly captured what happened in the days following 9-11 with his photos. Also there were so many items taken from the actual sight and history of stories behind all his photos. A very emotional museum and a must see!Then as we walked towards the Hudson River we found the new Highline Trail that was just awesome...a wonderful trail for a nice walk. I wanted to check this out also and just stumbled into it. This was great. As you walk past the museum, make a left then a right on the next street. WONDERFUL photo ops of some beautiful mural work on the wall in black and white. We just loved this little area. Wish it wasn't so hot the day we were there with 100 degree weather. We would have enjoyed this much more. Also lots of nice high end clothing stores for window shopping.Thank you Mr. Suson for your dedication which captured the moments of our nationals worst tragedy so \u201cWe will NEVER forget!\u201d"

He is a true American hero. At first I was leery about going to a 9/11 museum because I am still shaken everytime I see the planes crashing into the World Trade Center, however, the very first thing our tourguide says is they will NOT show anything relating to the planes crashing or any of the horrendous actions that we all saw through the media on 9/11 and still to this day. And for that, I am very thankful for. I highly recommend this workshop as a MUST DO when traveling to NYC. I've even recommended this to a friend of mine who is in NYC right now looking for things to do. Two thumbs up - way up."

Even though the museum is in the Meatpacking district I feel it is still the best one to go to. With this being a 2 hour event I was worried at first that we would have a tour guide that would walk us through everything and instead I was able to move at my own pace.

When remembering the events of September 11, 2001, there is a tendency to think mostly of the tradgedy of that day; the planes crashing into the twin towers and their eventual collapse. The photos and artifacts contained in this small space respects and accurately conveys the reality of the day's events without \"replaying the film\" of the tradgedy of the day. How, you may ask? The answer to that question is in the nine month recovery effort that followed; counter-acting and destroying the despair and evil that abounded that day. The poignant photos of this recovery effort tell a story of faith and love that leads to a place of restored hope for humanity.What enduring love is it that would compel so many to perservere in searching and recovering those who perished - many of whom layed down their lives for others? What enduring love is it that labors to acknowledge and restore the dignity of every life lost in an honor guard procession done with reverence and respect? What enduring love is it that brings brothers, fathers, siblings to ground zero day after day to search for their victim loved-ones with devotion to the cause of their recovery, even if it meant they themselves would be completely spent? What enduring love is it that sustained them so that at the end of the nine month recovery effort, all who labored could at the very least say to their fallen brothers and sisters in a whispered prayer: \"I did all I could and I will never forget you?\"When I \"replay the film\" of the actual, tragic events on the day of 9/11, I shed tears of despair and hopelessness. Now I have the photo images in the Ground Zero museum to \"retell the story.\" It helps to transcend the despair and hopelessness of that day. The tears shed are now healing and this is a tribute to those who labored in the recovery effort. Their example continues to exemplify what it is to have faith; what it is to have hope; what it means to love with an intensity that conquers evil.I recommend a visit to this museum to all who would like to move past the tradgedy and despair of that day and walk with those who labored in the recovery effort to a place of faith, hope and love."

            "review": "Don't miss this emotional but compassionate look at Ground Zero!. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop is in the former studio of the photographer, Marlon Suson. Mr. Suson was selected by the New York Fire Department to be their official photographer, and spent about 8 months photographing the work done at Ground Zero following 9/11. Don't let the small size of the studio fool you -- there's artwork, artifacts, and accompanying descriptions everywhere (including the bathroom!) that are an excellent representation of the recovery work done at Ground Zero, as well as the personal stories of those involved.The \"workshop\" consists of 2 parts: an introductory speech and video, followed by a headset you can use to listen to descriptions of the art and artifacts. The headset allows you to go through the art in any order you like, at whatever speed you like. The narration is done by Mr. Suson. The photographs are amazing--everything from photos of the fire department's honor guard watching removal of a body covered by the American flag to canine units to subways destroyed underneath the Twin Towers. We had two teenagers with us and they were fascinated by the exhibit, but without feeling overwhelmed. They were 6 and 7 years old when 9/11 occurred, and this was a great way to give them a fuller understanding. We came in thinking we'd just take a \"quick look\", and ended up spending almost 2 hours there.Call ahead for times--there are about 25 people per group, and groups start at specific times. We called the morning we wanted to go and got in with no problem."

            "review": "You MUST come here!. We recently visited the Ground Zero Museum Workshop, tucked away in the Meatpacker District of Manhattan, New York. Called \"the best little museum in New York,\u201d the Ground Zero Museum Workshop, by design, is a small and intimate space that impacts its visitors in a big way. Although it was much smaller than we anticipated (one room of about 1,000 sf), our allotted two hours was barely long enough to take it all in. This tiny museum was originally the studio of photographer Gary Marlon Suson. Following the attack on the World Trade Center, Suson was invited to be the official photographer at Ground Zero for the Uniformed Firefighters Association and the Uniformed Fire Officers Association. As such, he, alone, had full access to the Ground Zero site, where he respectfully documented the recovery efforts. Many of his photographs are on display at the Ground Zero Museum Workshop, along with remnants from the Ground Zero recovery.After a brief introductory video, including a segment with Mr. Suson\u2019s interview on CNN, we were turned loose, with headsets and a control box. We would stop at each exhibit and enter the exhibit number; a recording by Gary Marlon Suson (who is also an actor), told us, in detail, about the photo or object or collection of objects we were seeing. (Nearly 100 exhibits).It is hard to explain what we saw and heard and felt as we toured the museum. Mr. Suson's photographs and displays show dignity and respect, for the victims, survivors and the rescue workers. Interesting and informative, appropriate and accurate, intimate and humbling, showing reverence and heroism with an occasional touch of humor, the audio tour made me feel like I was having an intimate discussion with Gary Suson. The personal accounts made the rescuers real, and not just bits of news briefly shown on TV \u2026 a TV documentary could never convey the emotions that this tour brings.While it has been nearly 10 years since that tragic day, this amazing photography exhibit made me feel like I was there in those difficult months in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. It brought back some of the sadness and raw emotions of that day, but I also felt Hope. Peace. Spirituality. And even God\u2019s Presence.Admission was $25.00 per person, but was well worth it. Bear in mind that this is a Not-for-Profit museum; the admission price goes to six charities related to the tragedy.You must make reservations, and pay for your tour in advance. Some tours are sold out, as there is a limited number of visitors allowed in for each tour. (I am guessing that there are no more than 100 people per day, divided between the three 2-hour tours.) Photos are allowed, but videos are not. You must put your purses, backpacks, etc. on a shelf when you walk in; but, once we saw the setup, we were comfortable leaving some expensive camera equipment and a purse on the shelving.We are very glad that we found the Ground Zero Museum Workshop for our short stay in NYC, and wholeheartedly recommend this museum to everyone old enough to understand this experience. Thank you, Mr. Suson!We followed our visit to the Ground Zero Museum Workshop with a stop at the Tribute WTC Visitor Center. While Mr. Suson\u2019s museum focused primarily on the rescue and recovery operations, the Tribute focused on the victims and survivors. We had a moving and informative tour of the WTC site, led by a survivor, who told us her story of that fateful day.Both museums were individually fantastic. We, personally, were glad that we chose to experience both, as it gave us a truly well-rounded picture, of the past, the present and of a hopeful future.We will never forget!"

After visiting the Ground Zero Museum Workshop it was difficult to think of how to review this kind of \"attraction.\" Nearly 10 years ago my husband and I remember (like so many) where we were when we learned that the United States of America was under attack. On our trip to NYC we felt it only fitting to honor the memory of those most affected by this tragedy by keeping the memory alive. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop allowed us to do just that. Within the museum there are countless photos and artifacts which capture the true human emotion of the day. The audio clips which accompany each object add to the story. We recommend visiting this Museum for anyone who was touched by the events of 9/11."

I imagine nothing could have prepared Mr. Suson to memorialize this recovery effort; that is, for the emotional attachment captured so beautifully in his heartrending images. The images combined with the selected artifacts provide a poignant insight into what the men and women involved faced. You will leave carrying what I\u2019m sure is just a small part of what he, and all of those involved, now carry with them forever. Thanks to Mr. Suson, (who made a point to introduce himself at the start of our time in the museum and be available at the end) and the staff for making available such a touching exhibit.Practical tips: you are allowed to take pictures, you must make reservations for a specific time slot; because it is located in an intimate space the door at the sidewalk level is listed only by a small sign by the floor you buzz to get in."

You need to purchase advance tickets online or by phone as only a certain number of people are allowed on each tour. Not a very large museum, full of photographs that were taken by Gary Marlon Suson, the official photographer during the recovery of Ground Zero. There's a film that is shown and then a short talk by a guide. Then, with headsets you're free lo listen to a description of each item in the museum at your own pace. There's about 100 photographs and displays. If you can fit it into your schedule, take the last tour in the afternoon as it affords more time as there is not a constraint of getting people out for another group to come in. (If they are not in a hurry to close for the day.) Bring your camera as you're allowed to take pictures. There's a coat rack outside the room and backpacks will have to be put on a shelf. A negative comment I heard was that it was only a small room, but I guarantee you that you won't have enough time to get through the displays and photographs that are housed in the museum in the time allotted, if you really want to see it all. The photographs portrayed a very difficult time in our history in a very moving and sensitive way.Thank you Gary Suson~you were able to humanize the most horrible event in our present day country's history and your \"images will insure that people never forget\""

The photographer was the official photographer for 9/11, so nobody else was allowed to take the photos that he did. They also let you hold actual items that they obtained from that site.

This museum brings home the reality of the terrible act which led to the loss of almost 3000 precious lives. However, it also reminds us of the many inspirational people who were involved in the recovery efforts, as soon as the first tower was hit and for many months thereafter. Rather than focus solely upon tragic events of that awful day this museum provides an extremely sensitive insight into the less publicised (but no less poignant) months of recovery afterwards. Upon entry to the museum, which is set in an intimate space in NYC's Meat -packing district (less than 10mins from Ground Zero by Subway), you are shown two short videos about the events of 9/11 and the aftermath. You can then walk around the museum at your leisure (within the tour time slot) viewing the numerous photos/artefacts and listening to the associated stories via a self guided handheld audio tour. You are able to take photos (no videos) of all except one item in the museum; the story behind this piece will no doubt bring a tear to even the toughest of eyes. Photo postcards and REQUIEM - a book by Mr Gary Marlon Suson (the owner of the museum and photographer of all the amazing photos) are also available to purchase. Mr Suson actually came into the museum towards the end of our tour and he kindly agreed to sign the REQUIEM book that I had purchased. In summary, if you are planning a visit to New York and have an interest in what happened after the towers collapsed on 11th September 2001 then a visit to this museum is a must. Mr Suson is an awe-inspiring photographer who (in my humble opinion) captured not only evidence of the many hours of hard recovery work conducted by members of the NY Fire Department and associated authorities, but also the true emotions involved with such a chilling task. I would highly recommend a visit to this museum. Although obviously harrowing at times, this museum left me with a great sense of hope and became the highlight of my 5 day trip to NYC!"

We are from a small town, and many of their family members are volunteer firefighters. It was something special for my students, who already honor the sacrifices of firefighters, to really understand the brave efforts of the 9/11 rescue workers. As we wandered the room listening to the stories behind many of the photos and artifacts, no one was immune from emotion. I've been to the Anne Frank Museum, which served as a model for this. The Ground Zero Museum shows the same restraint and tact in dealing with a difficult and sensitive subject. Tickets were $25, with part of the proceeds going to help those affected by 9/11. It was well worth it.The Museum is on the second floor of a building. There is an elevator as well as safe storage for coats, purses, and bags. An interesting touch was the bowl of chocolates in the bathroom - as one guide told us, chocolates are good to fight depression. I know chocolate is no cure for tragedy, but this human touch was somehow cheering.Also, make sure not to look for this attraction near the WTC site. It is to the west, in the Meatpacking District."

I wish I could agree with all of the superior rating reviews but this would not be high on my list of recommended stops for visitors to NYC. There is a good deal of self promotion involved for the photographer, Gary Suson. There are some emotional stories told and written on placards by various artifacts that came out of Ground Zero or were donated by survivors. You hear the tour guide\u2019s speech, see a video and then are able to walk around a small room and see the artifacts. There is a certain commercial element imbalance that I was uncomfortable with, books and book marks etc for sale. The guide mentions that some of the proceeds go towards the victim\u2019s family but there is not mention or documentation, charts etc. of how much and the contribution thus far. I went to the staging area near Ground Zero where a store front across from St Paul\u2019s\u2019 Chapel has been set up with the models of the memorials and what is to come there, and there were statistics on the wall with a time sequence and videos playing.

When you go be prepared because you will cry but you will also smile. The tour is very personal because you will be allowed to actually touch some of the recovered artifacts and here personal stories what go along with the pictures and items. If you get the chance to visit New York City do not miss this tour. It is so worth the cost."

It may be small, but don't let that put you off. Its cosy, but understandably when family and friends of victims go there to try to find some answers and peace. The photos are amazing and tell a story of not only the terrible thing that happened on 9/11, but of the team work, courage and determination of the persons at the site. If going to New York you have to go here. Well worth the money and a lot more."

This small museum on West 14th should be a must for anyone making a trip to New York as well as residents of the city. It's simply amazing.My wife and I visited it last week. It's so many things wrapped up in one small room. Despair, anger, sorrow, inspiration, compassion.....the list goes on. The photographs and artifacts are amazing and are made to come to life with the narration by Gary Marlon Suson via the handheld receiver and headphones each guest is provided. There are so many breathtaking and heartbreaking stories in the museum that it is difficult to identify just one as the marquee exhibit. Just go......just go and see it all for yourself. I promise you will not regret it.One note...when we were buying tickets from the museum web site, the one day we could attend was sold out. It was the only sellout showing for the next few weeks. Just my luck. I really wanted to go, so I contacted the museum directly and they were kind enough to add us to the list as overflow but told us we might have to stand during the intro video (which we didn't even have to do). Later, I noticed that one of the tour companies that appear on line was selling tickets for the date and time I wanted. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. I personally watched a family of five be turned away even though they had a \"ticket\" for that day and time. The tour companies sell you tickets first and worry about space available later. This family was agreeable to coming back the following day, but I suspect others might not be able to be as flexible. Buy your tickets directly from the museum and no one else to prevent this from happening to you.Again, this is an incredible place to visit. Because of its content, it feels wrong characterizing it as an \"attraction,\" but it is certainly a needed reminder for us all of the events of that day and the physical and spiritual recovery process that followed."

No mention is made of how much of the proceeds from the Museum are paid to the families of the 9/11 disaster. Visiting the museum is an emotional jourrney, I think Mr Suson should advertise how much of your entrance dollar is paid over to the survivors and their families.

I would suggest booking your tickets on line with the workshop before you arrive in New York to ensure you don't miss out. The tours begin at 1100hrs & 1300hrs most days and cost $25 each per adult. There is not a lot to see around the workshop area, but we went into the nearby Chelsea market for a bite to eat as we were slightly early.We decided to get a cab afterwards to ground zero itself. The church opposite \"the site\" has an exhibition which is worth a visit. The official museum is due to open fully next year and is also worth a look as well whilst you are there.

Luckily for us Mr Suson was there when we visited, still working. He is not only honoured to have been the only man who was allowed to take photos but the comentary he recorded for the displays was done with true dignity, feeling and respect. Mr Suson is the instrumentor behind this museum, after getting inspiration from the Anne Frank museum, he wanted to give the world the insight that that gave for the holocaust for 9/11. He most certainly succeeded.None of these people are glory seekers, they are all there because they care. This museum provides an insight to this terrible disaster for those personally affected and for those of us that weren't.

The Ground Zero Museum provides a thoughtful balance between eye-witness accounts of the rescue teams, photographs of the aftermath, and, from the Towers themselves, flotsam and jetsam which have now taken on a significance far beyond their original purpose. With its focus on the specific and the individual, the museum handles this tragedy with a sensitivity to which we can all relate. Its universal themes of family, friendship, love, loss and the ties that bind provide a unique way of approaching the rescue immediately following the attack. It is by not addressing the larger question of \"why\", that visitors are left enuncumbered to consider the human dimension and by so doing, the loss is made even greater."

It shows some amazing stories, and lets you understand the big story behind the events after 11/9. rather than telling the usual story about the terror attack. The two girls that guided us through the museum were great! They answered every one of our questions in a professional way, and also were very friendly and kind.

Arriving late (it is in an area we weren't overly familiar with) the two women working that day (a Sunday) were very helpful and understanding. After two very emotive videos and a powerful intro from one of the curators, we were handed our audio guides and headphones and left to wander around the gallery plugging in numbers relating to photos and artifacts. The photographers voice (Gary Marlon Suson) is used throughout the tour as he relates to each item, a very soothing voice good for storytelling I found it comforting.The raw emotion overpowered me at the end of my tour, seeing items such as a calendar, stopped clock and teddy bear it made it easy to relate personally to the tragedy. The layout was very fitting, softly lit and well spaced it was very respectful.We went that night to the world trade centre site which I saw back in 2006 before the new building work has started, and it was sad but interesting to be able to relate what happened to the towers.My advice would be take tissues, beware of the animal related stories and try to listen to as much info on as many items as possible. A very sad but fitting tribute to ensure we don't forget, and continue to support those affected by 9/11."

Enclosed in a second floor walk-up (elevator available), the artist has filled a room with exclusive photographs, and artifacts retrieved during the 8-month Recovery Period after the fall of the World Trade Center in September 11, 2001. Gary Marlon Suson was the only person authorized by the Uniformed Firefighters Association, the city firefighters' main union, to be present and take photographs of the Recovery. Gary's pictures are intimate, professional, private and personal. Gary was also allowed to collect a range of artifacts that would have been otherwise disposed of, that tell the tale of lives lived, and lives lost. To bring the pictures to life, visitors are provided an audio tour, where the artist provides his story about how the picture was taken, what was happening when the picture was taken, or a story around a particular artifact displayed. There's nothing not to like about the Museum. The room is intimate and comforting, providing an emotional haven.Photographs inside the museum are allowed, videos are not. Don't bring a lot of baggage with you inside the museum, there is just not a lot of room for large backpacks swinging around!Visitors are allowed to take full advantage of their two-hour timeslot, then are cleared out, to allow for the next group of visitors."

It was oh so heart rending and moving and the organisers have done an excellent job to achieve this in such a small space. It's not open to the public so you do need to book the tour and allow 2 hours to do it justice.I hope now that New York does justice to the memory of the individuals lost and to the towers themselves when the memorial gardens and new World Trade Center open. And although the loss of so many firefighters in the atrocity was appalling - and this is the focus of the museum - I would hope that at some point there could be a wider focus in memory of the office workers, plane passengers and officers of the NYPD who were also taken away from their families at that time.In my view this was one of the highlights of our visit to NY and should be a must on any itinerary."

A brief video will be played and you'll be invited to sit in comfy chairs to watch and listen. The remaining time is yours to go around to the exhibits. All are numbered and correspond to the narration on the audio tour. When we toured, I didn't want to miss a single exhibit!Our kids (10 and 13) also found the museum a great experience and were totally absorbed for our entire two hours there. I do wish we could have had another 15 minutes, as I felt a little bit rushed (however I was the last person done, so not sure what that reason was!!). We did start our visit about 5-10 minutes late due to the fact that we were waiting for some late-comers to arrive (they had two hosts working, so I would have thought one person could have waited for them and let the rest get started).Mr. Suson did come in during our time at the museum. He's very personable willing to visit. Rating our NYC visit, this museum was way moving and interesting compared to almost everything else!!!"

This is a must see \"attraction\" while in NYC. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The DVD shown is very moving and the displays could not have been done better. While a bit cumbersome to schedule your time to go to the museum, I now understand why it is done the way it is. It makes the experience much more meaningful to share the time with only a small group of people."

My boyfriend and I booked a trip to the workshop before we went to NY and when I got there I was a little perplexed by why it was not near to Ground Zero.Max group size of 24 this is well worth a visit. The museum workshop is set in a small studio and is a very tasteful collection of artifacts and photos from the recovery operation at Ground Zero. Set up by the only official photographer for GZ, this gallery is really moving. After a small introduction and video each visitor is given a headset and hand held device. As you move through the series of artifacts and photo's each numbered, you can listen to descriptions, thoughts on each piece by simply putting in the number.I personally found this a very moving visit which has helped me know more about the historic events of 9/11. It doesn't contain any footage or photo's of the attacks nor does it feature any photo's of victims at the site."

It was all very well-organized and respectful. No images of the planes striking the towers were shown b/c the guide said it would not be healing in any way. We found out, this morning, that a camera crew from CNN would be filming inside the museum, today. Every attendee is given a set of headphones and a \"remote control\". The guide explains what you will be doing and that expressing emotion is perfectly okay. A video segment is shown with images and audio for about 10 minutes. After that, you are free to move about the room to view photos and artifacts while listening to information on your headset. You may choose what to listen to and type in the number on your remote for that display. You go at your own pace and multiple people may be listening to the same display at the same time. There were kids in attendance, today, also. It was not meant to be scary in any way. You may take photographs of everything except for a piece of one of the planes (out of respect). The experience is very personal b/c the museum is very small. You have about 2 hrs for the whole experience and may purchase postcards, the photographer's hardcover book, or other items. There is a bathroom available and some chocolates, if you need a natural \"anti-depressant\". The experience is very educational and shows real artifacts found at Ground Zero. A few artifacts are passed around. The exhibit even pays respect to the rescue dogs. I purchased the book and some postcards to frame in my home. The photographer, Gary Sussan, was the only official photographer allowed to stay at Ground Zero during the recovery efforts. You may not have seen most of these images and artifacts, before. Also, there are no images of bodies, so the experience is not gory or shocking in that way. It was a very moving experience."

We would highly recommend this workshop to anybody with an interest in the impact of the events during and after 9/11; in many ways it is better than visiting the site itself, although you should do both. It wouldn't be right to say that we enjoyed it, because that is the wrong word to describe the emotion, but it was emotional and, I suspose, inspiring. I suspect more for Americans of any belief, who can take pride in the selflessness of their fire fighters, police and others who worked so hard after the event. For everyone else, it was life-affirming to see what people will do to help others. I don't think it is suitable for young children, although there were young children there who were no trouble and the staff entertained well, they were just bored. Do go and make your own minds up about it."

Once upstairs we were shown into an area no bigger than 40 x 30 -the museum is tiny! Yet it became immediately apparent that the size is kept small on purpose as it creates an intimate experience. After receiving our headsets and electronic tour guides, the tour started with two videos about the curator and photographer Gary Marlon Suson, whose work is displayed on the walls of the space. Annie our tour guide let us know in advance that getting emotional was perfectly alright.Well, we all did, and in the almost two and half hours we spent in there we all experienced the same terrible frustration and loss of nine years ago, and shared the ongoing anger and sadness that this act of violence continues to weigh on the citizens of NYC: one by one these fearless rescuers are succumbing to cancers and diseases because of ground zero's pollution. We were fortunate to meet Mr. Suson in person, and can honestly tell you we shook hands with a hero. His dedication to preserving the courageous rescue efforts at ground zero has brought us intimately close to their stories of loss, sacrifice and miracles."

This museum didn't even feature in our NY city guide, it was only via word of mouth that we found out about it and I would say it was the most worthwhile thing I did whilst in New York.The museum is very intimate and the limited number of you there at one time really adding to the experience. Centred in the meat packing district, Gary Suson has created a homage to those killed on September 11th 2001 at the World Trade Centre site. Other than one picture of the south tower collapsing on the morning everything else in the museum is based on the clear up operation and the search for survivours and bodies amongst the wreckage. Being the only photographer allowed onto ground zero after the third week from the collapse - this is a very unique insight into a world many of us would never have seen.There is a very informative audio guide, spoken by the photographer himself, for all the pictures and some of the objects to which recounts a story of the time the picture was taken or details behind the object. You can listen to as many or as few of these as you feel although having listened to all of them myself, I would recommend taking the time and listening to each story.We met Gary at the end of our time there, he was a very down to earth and friendly man, giving us tips on dining and other places to go and see! He took the pictures and set up this museum, but it is all charity based work he does here for the NY firemen and women and survivors and children of 9/11.Overall I would say this was by far the best day in New York at any museum. It not only gave me a better understanding of 9/11 but also made me realise the impact of this on New York but also the world as a whole - after all we did enter into a war which still rages on today because of it."

Luckily I was in time for the last that day which started at 1pm. After an introduction by one of the guides who explained that the museum was private and established by the NY Fire Department, we watched a video and could then wander around the exhibits with an audio feed which explained each of the numbered items. There are many photos. In fact the museum focuses on the work of Gary Marlon Suson, the only photographer allowed on site to record the recovery phase to which this museum is devoted. Gary narrates the audio feed and his descriptions and explanations of the items and the background to his photos is often wrenching and always fascinating. I did not expect to learn so much or be so moved. There are items you can handle and you can ask any question. Many victim's families have visited and their responses form part of the narrative. As the room is so small and the tour groups need to be small as a result, this is an exceptionally intimate experience. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It helped me as an Australian to better understand the impact of 9/11 the people of New York. I must admit to thinking at times that they were making too big a deal of it, given that so many other countries endure worse tragedies routinely. In fact, the response of the city to this event is an inspiration."

We believe that everyone who has a chance should take the time to visit this museum. The artifacts and especially the video makes this a very emotional expierence. Mr. Suson, the photographer and creator of the museum, happened to be there during our visit and gave us better insite into the aftermath of that terrible day. We were pleased to learn that part of the cost of our admittance goes into a fund for the families of the thousands of innocent people who were murdered on 9/11."

At first we weren't sure as it was away from Ground Zero itself and we made it to our destination but had to wait til minutes before it started til someone came out to brief us on what was to happen. About 20 people went up to the second floor \"gallery\" or sorts and were given headsets to listen to videos that they played of original radio conversations had on Sept. ll, 2001. Then we got to walk around the room and key in the number next to each photograph or exhibit into our personal device and heard the story behind the photo or exhibit as relayed by Gary Marlon Suson, the only photographer allowed at Ground Zero during recovery operations. The artifacts were magnificent from glass from one of the top windows of the Twin Towers (three inches thick) to a clock found stopped at the precise time the bldg. fell. It is a two hour tour and it was a quiet, respectful place. One of the highlights of our trip. At the end, you feel like you were there and experienced a lot of what went on. You certainly felt like you had a glimpse into the lives of the families left behind and the rescue crews and what they went through following that tragedy."

I am glad that this museum exists - it has important artifacts and photographs. I don't know how anyone could leave this workshop without having shed a tear or many. I am grateful that Ms. Susson has made these things available to the public - but we got the impression that he feels that he is a celebrity because of his access - he sells his autographs - and although the room is small - a great deal of precious space is used to flog a variety of items that he has signed. It was a little off-putting. The audio that accompanies each display is very good - but there are times when he makes it a bit too much about him, you know what I mean? We were a litte put off as well by the number of religious symbols and references - as this is not a church musuem and religion, (or lack thereof) is a very personal thing - and which certainly gives comfort to some people - this need, want or belief in it should not be assumed. He really does try to honour those who work personally affected on 9-11 - and this is a good thing. It appears his ego got in the way a few times - but maybe we would all be like that. Maybe celebrity gets to everyone if they are interviewed enough times.The guide made a few errors. She said \"St. Peter's Chapel\" instead of \"St. Paul's Chapel\" and there were a few other inconsistencies - however she was pretty good overall.I was glad to have a reason to explore the meatpacking district - but I don't believe I would go to this workshop again or"

We expected the small room with audio descriptions of the individuals at Ground Zero and artifacts from the World Trade Center destruction of 9/11. We read about how Gary Suson had access to the site during the recovery and cleanup operations. We especially expected a very moving experience and we got one. There was only one distraction during the 2 hours we spent there. Instead of stepping back and letting Ground Zero be the center of the story, it often seemed like Gary Suson was the center of the story. The pictures where he just described the events (such as the search dogs or the 2 firefighters looking for their brother) nearly brought tears but the scene with a man praying was more described as how lucky Gary was to be able to \"fire off a few pictures\" and catch a good pic rather than truly try to capture the emotion of the moment; or how dangerous it was for him to be walking backwards on the rubble while getting a great picture which seemed to trivialize the fact that the men walking in front of him were carrying a dead victim; or how this picture or that picture is so famous. I really admire the hours he put in and the emotion he captured. But in this setting I do not want to hear about being in the right position or luckily avoiding debris hitting you and let the enormity of the event reveal itself unencombered. That being said, I would recommend this to everyone. Holding a piece of metal from the debris or especially for me, seeing a piece of the airplane that hit the building will bring home the events of 9/11 in a tangible way."

Mr. Suson's pictures go beyond what words can describe. You leave the museum never thinking of that day the way you did when you first walked in. Mr. Suson not only has a story behind every picture he has in his museum, he has collected artifacts from Ground Zero that are on display.

Definitely a well put together museum capturing the clear up operation after9/11. It is a small quiet area and possibly less suitable for small children although numbers of groups are controlled and limited. If you are on a tight time frame could be difficult to fit this in and visit ground zero so plan well - it is not far on the subway but not a lot else in the area to tie in with it. I would recommend taking a lunch nearby as great near by typical Diner or other eateries - although did not actually eat there. If in a rush ground zero actual site is a definite visit and perhaps captures more the event and has some memorial sites. I found the children visiting did get restless after an hour but there is 2 hours worth of audio etc to listen to while there. Definitely my wife and I glad visited ( and from research felt it was the best place to go) and were moved although would have liked to see more of the actual immediate aftermath events/stories etc. The price is quite high but be aware at least it is a non profit organisation."

However, we were pointed towards a few important pictures and exhibits amoung more than one hundred, each with a very personal story. After two short films, Gary Suson introduced himself, and talked about his expeiriences. It was evident that the museum is an important part of his own method of coping with the trauma of providing the only photographic record of the ground zero recovery. We were left to explore the individual exhibits with an audio guide, with Gary on hand to answer questions and talk about his work. The whole exhibition is very tastefully displayed and gave a real insight into what the rescuers encountered in their mission to recover the victims of the 911 atrocity. We were moved to tears."

This \"museum\" is in one room thats probably only 700 square feet in size, I was expecting something larger. Secondly, this attraction takes about two hours to do. I don't recommend people takes kids here as anyone under 16 will most likely be bored."

There are no photos of planes crashing in to the towers or the towers collapsing. This is about the people who survived or lost a loved one. The photos and artifacts are one of a kind and amazing. The group watches a video together and then you wear your own headphones/tour mate and experience the story behind each artifact and photo. Give yourself an hour or two and don't rush. Buy your tickets online and make a reservation. You can visit the World Trade Center Site after the museum which is not far by subway or taxi."

My wife and I have just returned from a 5 day NY trip in which we pretty much managed to get around almost every major tourist attraction. For me this museum was the best thing we saw and I have to recommend it to every NY visitor. The museum is based on the photographs of the offical FDNY photographer Gary Suson (who was there to answer questions) for the 9/11 tragedy. Needless to say it is a very emotional experience but done in a touching and humble way, and all proceeds go towards families and charities connected with 9/11 - the stories behind the tragedy and the recovery period were very moving indeed. Book a trip to this museum next time you're in NY, you will most certainly not be disappointed."

As stated in many reviews the museum is very small. That was not a problem. We were able to take our time and view as many photos as we wanted. Not only were the photos heartbreaking, beautiful and educational; the commentary on each by Gary Marlon Suson added both emotion and information.My only worry is that the museum staff may be allowing in too many people for each timed viewing. While our group was still manageable it was slightly crowded. We were among the last to leave so had plenty of space to get close to the photos we couldn't easily access earlier. There was a very small group waiting for the next tour as we left, so maybe our group was unusually large.No matter what, it was worth the ticket and allowing the full two hours."

During a recent family trip to New York City, we made reservations to visit the Ground Zero Museum Workshop that my sister had found on-line. Upon arriving at the small 2nd floor workshop, I was immediately turned off by the single room that the entire museum was placed in. To boot, it was quite warm and I was not looking forward to spending time in the small confined space sweating like crazy.Let me say that I was blown away by the presentation and content that the workshop had to provide. After a brief movie introduction and talk by one of the very friendly docents, we were left to roam through each display at our own pace, utilizing the audio device to get specific information about the items that were being presented.This museum is the work of one Gary Marlon Suson who was the only person allowed into the depths of the great pit where once stood the twin towers, to be the official photographer of what had taken place. With pictures and specific artifacts that were recovered, Mr. Suson takes you on a personal tour of each of the pieces, providing you with a story for each and every item. Some stories are longer, and some short, but ALL of them will blow your mind. I can even say that on multiple occasions I teared up from what I was privileged to be viewing.This place is a MUST SEE for anyone visiting New York and looking to see a realistic tour of what took place on September 11, 2001. We visited one other museum dedicated to the horrific 9/11 experience and while it was moving, nothing compared to what we saw at the Ground Zero Museum Workshop. I wholeheartedly recommend it! You will not be sorry!One final note, as we were leaving we were privileged to meet Gary Suson and he was quite humbled and very grateful for everyone that can share in what he personally experienced during his time."

The museum is set out in a way that you are able to learn all about the terrible events of 9/11 almost first hand. It was very moving to see how this awful event unfolded before us all , but filmed and told in such an understanding and sensitive way that makes it an absolutely essential place to experience. The museum itself is set in a fairly small area and is quite intimate so is only open to small parties of around 10 people at a time, so it is advisable to book in advance. It was uplifting because you can also read about how those involved are comming to terms with what happened and how life goes on after it. I would recommend this museum as no matter how far away you were on that date it was an event that touched all of us and it makes us realise how much people give through their work for others without a thought for themselves.

The museum although very small makes for an intimate visit, with no more than 20 or so people allowed in at any one time.

The museum is one of the most powerful exhibits I have witnessed in dealing with a time in American history that found us all searching. The photographs depict the tragedy and personal stories of the common man. Although there was one photograph of the actual tragedy as it occurred, the rest were the spirit of the American people and the volunteers who spent countless hours giving of their time for those whose lives ended on September 11. The artifacts only added to the atmosphere, and although it was somewhat depressing, the spirit of the American people lives on through the wonderful work of Mr. Suson. Kudos to him and the staff at the museum!!!"

The museum is in a room the size of a living room really, yet there was enough room for the 20 or so people in our group to move around easily. There is quite an impressive collection of photographs of the aftermath from 9/11 by Gary Suson who was the only official photographer at Ground Zero during the initial months after the tragedy. Suson has a wonderful narrative voice which he uses to tell stories of each of the photographs and artifacts included in the museum (including actual window glass from the towers and desk items found in the rubble). The stories of the victims, survivors and families make each picture come alive. You can pick and choose what you want to learn about with the self-guided headphone set. The entire experience is very touching. What we did not like was waiting outside to get into the building. Do NOT go early as you won't be able to go inside until your tour time and we were 30 minutes early, unfortunately. Our tour started 15 minutes late (more standing and waiting outside) and we were told by one tour guide that another guide was doing some \"spiffing up and cleaning for us\" which was strange since we were the first tour of the day. Still, the whole experience takes about 1 1/2 hours. There are posters, postcards and books for sale and some of the money goes to the victims' families. I would have purchased the book but it was too large and heavy to carry around all day (a low rate shipping option would be nice). My family rated this experience a \"B\" overall but upgraded it to \"A\" when we unexpectedly ran into Gary Suson at the small church by the actual Ground Zero site and were able to talk to him more about the museum. He is quite personable and has many interesting and emotional stories to share about his experience."

The room is welcoming, with places to sit for anyone who has tears to shed. The initial explanation given by the guide is in-depth and enlightening and the short video shown before viewing the exhibit is eye-opening. The artifacts were extremely thought provoking, and having been given the opportunity to touch some, made the experience much more real. The museum was tastefully set up. It was the account of Gary Marlon Suson, the brave official photographer for the Uniformed Firefighters Association & Uniformed Fire Officers Association (FDNY). He managed to document history, take these incredible pictures, and collect these meaningful objects while trying to grapple with the extremely emotional content of what he had to photograph. At the end of our tour, we got the opportunity to meet Mr. Suson, and my daughter asked him questions. His responses were sensitive and definitely age-appropriate.

You cannot visit New York without visiting this insightful look into the recovery process that took place after that terrible tragedy inflicted upon innocent people of the world and New York city. The poignant display's of Gary Suson's images respectfully give us a glimpse of the amazing job the recovery workers did, and help us to try and understand the magnitude of what took place.We must never forget, this museum will serve to ensure that generations of people from all over the world will remember......This visit was probably the highlight of our visit to New York, my husband and 16 yr old daughter would agree, although we wish there was no need for such a museum to exist it it the most respectful and touching display I have seen. Thanks Gary, we were also lucky enough to meet Gary and have a permenant reminder in his beautiful book to share with our family and friends back in Australia, so they too can share this experience and never forget"

The stories, photographs, and assorted items from that tragic day are all on display. You form a very personal connection with the families and rescuers who's lives changed forever. My family and I (2 grown children ), had the opportunity to meet the photographer / museum owner, Gary Suson. The many difficult months he spent photographing the ruins and rescuers still shows on his face. Be prepared to shed a few tears, but don't worry, they have plenty of tissues and chocolates to help you through it!"

You get to witness artifacts that you never thought would be shown to the public. The people there are kind and generous, they really treat their guests with respect and gratitude. Clearly this museum is not looking to make profits, but more to share the story with the people. It is DEFINITELY the biggest small museum in the world. 100% recommended, you would be missing out if you didnt go!"

At first glance, the room appears too small to offer a 'value for money' experience. However, after subsequently being totally absorbed in a new depth of emotion and a discovery of highly interesting and hitherto unknown (to us) facts, two hours passed by so quickly. Make no mistake about it, this was a fabulous experience, very sensitively presented, highly emotional and often deeply disturbing. Everyone appeared to be so absorbed that you could have heard a pin drop as each of us tried to deal with what we were seeing and hearing - in disbelief, shock and horror whilst at the same time in complete admiration of the courage and selflessness exhibited by all the emergency workers and rescuers. Our daughters were too young to watch the horrific events unfolding on that September day in 2001 and whilst we have made them aware of it over the years since, it is difficult to tell how tragedies like this are seen and processed through the eyes of a child. We wondered whether they would wish too see this tour on our trip to NYC, but with tears rolling down their innocent cheeks, we witnessed first hand the impact of the unlikely marriage of evil (the perpetrators) and heroism (the emergency services) on their developing characters. We were just about the last ones to leave - our group was fortunate to meet Gary Suson towards the end of our tour and that made it even more special. A great big thank you to him for such a respectful presentation. None of us will ever forget this tour for as long as we shall live. Of course, we wish this tour never had reason to exist at all. In conclusion, this tour is most highly recommended - we then went on to the museum at the WTC site itself - both are compelling and offer similar but different perspectives of 9/11 - and deep and lasting memories."

We walked there from 5th Ave and we extremely lucky as we got there 15mins early. What we hadn't realised was you needed to prebook and we hadn't. Fortunately there were spaces available. Once we got inside we understood why there is the need for advanced booking, as the room is small for a 'museum', however it is perfect for this museum. We were in luck again as Gary Susan was actually there so we got to speak to him and he told us about his experience in person, which was amazing. The photography and information that goes with them is fantasically presented and very moving. This was one of our last visits of the holiday and my husband said without a doubt the best. This is quite hard to comprehend as it was such a tragic event that you are seeing but the way the whole thing is presented is a fantastic way to really understand everything about the whole impact the World Trade Centre had on so many people."

Most in New York want to forget the events of 9-11, without forgetting the people affected. This museum does this in a wonderfully sobering way. I don't want to get into a lot of detail here, whereas it is kind of like a good movie, I'll give away too much! You must see it for yourself to truly understand and appreciate what Mr. Souson and FDNY have done by creating this tribute to all those affected by the tragedy of 9-11."

She spoke about the loss, the triumphs, the heartaches, and the love during that time. I swear if you stood still, you could hear the echoes of sadness and cries from each photograph. I can't tell you what was there because you have to experience this yourself. You see things on t.v. and only can assume what people were feeling but here you know exactly what they were feeling. Every photograph has a personal touching story. My God....I can only hope those who were lost on that day joined God quickly and peacefully.

When we first arrived to the outside of the museum in the meat packing district, we didn't think it looked like much and we thought perhaps we overspent for tickets on something that may be minimal for viewing. We even wondered how a two hour tour was going to be utilized fully for one room of items. HOWEVER, we were so wrong. It started with a video with phone call recordings from individuals at WTC and images post incident taken by the artist, Gary Suson. The tour is a self-guided audio tour that brings each visitor to every photograph and artifact on display. Each nook and cranny and portion of wall space is occupied with images and artifacts that tell a very emotional and potent story that will bring tears to your eyes. It was a good experience for my children who were just babies when the incident occured. It was even a good experience for my husband and myself as we were able to feel the emotions of what photograph or item was intended to convey. We were able to learn about specific individuals involved in the rescue efforts which personalized them as individuals who were just downtrodden and weary from what they had to endure. Seeing the artifacts from the WTC restaurant and gift shop or even items found in the debris just made it even more emotional. Again, it is a small museum but don't be fooled by size. It is a wealth of information and personalization of those involved with 9-11 that you didn't get in the news. You leave very humbled. The artist and the gentleman who hosted the tour were sensitive and informative individuals. We highly recommend it and it's definitely worth the cost for admission."

My friend, a retired United Airlines flight attendant, felt the need to go there to pay her respects. Not only is it an emotional experience, but also a spiritual one as Gary told the story of finding a page from Genesis 11 about the Tower of Babel.

At the actual site you cannot see much with all the barricades and draped fencing around the perimeter. It was almost impossible to figure out where the buildings once stood even though we had visited them several times in the past. We did not see written stories or many displays around this very active construction site. My group did not lose a loved one on 9/11, yet really appreciated the opportunity as fellow Americans, to spend special time learning more about that day, entering the time zone of 9/11 and feeling more a part of it, touching a bit of it, and paying respect to all those our hearts have poured out to over the past 8 years. There are comfortable sofas for anyone who wants or needs to sit and view the pictures and artifacts from them and listen to an audio tape explaining each one. The room was small enough that someone sitting on the sofas or in a wheelchair would have adequate access to the pictures/memorabilia mainly hanging on the walls. There were individual audio units to listen to stories about each of the 100+ exhibits. If you are hearing impaired, the video is not captioned and the audio players are not conducive even to those with mild losses. They are not set up with telecoil/induction loop/infra red systems, but you can request a written transcript which is very helpful. If this is the case, I would advise extra time which you might be allowed if you are the last session of the day (1pm?) (that's what we did so my hearing impaired daughter had more time to read the transcript). Dress cool in the summer months as it gets a bit warm in that room, and I highly recommend visiting this wonderful exhibit if you can."

I had done some research prior to visiting and was keen to visit this museum. You have to pre book your tickets as they only allow small groups of around 25 at a time. We arrived at the allocated time to be met by our very helpful guide. We were taken up into the actual museum hall which is quite small. We took our seats with around 20 other guests and were given an explanation by the guide about what the tour entailed. I soon realized that the room we were in was it, I do not know what I expected but was a little shocked at how small the place was. We watched two moving videos of the background of how this museum worked and how it had been put together. We then were free to walk around looking at some very moving pictures and listening to our own headsets we listened to some remarkable but some times emotional stories of individuals that were involved some how on the day or the very many long days after 9/11.There is nothing but tributes at this museum, not one glimpse of a plane hitting a tower etc just a very well put together group of pictures and artifacts retrieved from the twin towers and surrounding area. My wife and I, as well as our three son\u2019s, walked around listening to our headsets intently, all at our own pace and all starting at different points. After an hour, we all came to an end and sat down in the middle totally silent for a good few minutes. After we had all finished gathering our thoughts, one by one, we all said that this was a fabulous tribute and insight into the events on 9/11. We did many of the tourist things that you do in NYC that week and nothing was disappointing, this is a truly amazing city. When we got home grandparents and friends asked our sons what the best part of the break was and every one said this museum. We are a close family and have spent many vacations together all over the world, you always remember the good times you have as a family. This afternoon at this wonderful museum will stay with me and my family forever.Thank you to the wonderful people that have sympathetically put this project together.

Our tour guide answered all our questions and encouraged us to stay as long as we wanted. This museum is even more important now that you can't get close to the actual 911 site. I would not miss this tour."

I am so thankful that I saw the reviews of other travelers on Trip Advisor. I went ahead and visited, and I am thankful that I did. It is a very powerful and professionally-handled exhibit. The intent isn't to make a quick buck off of someone else's pain. The photographer is the only person who was allowed into the 9/11 site during the months and months of removal. Although a difficult experience to capture on film, I am so glad that he did. I learned so much more about the families of survivors, the NYC firefighters, the search dogs, etc. that I would have never known w/o attending. I would encourage everyone to visit this while in NYC."

Even the kids,(10 and 12), really got a lot out of it. I didn't hear ,even once, \"when are we leaving?\". Gary Suson was there that day, to \"fix a toilet\", I think. He was very down to earth and even spent time talking with the youngest of our gang in depth about a few of the pictures. A definite \"must see\"! P.s.- This museum is NOT AT GROUND ZERO!

Although it is not what usually comes to mind when you think of a museum- it is just one room- but, it is loaded with incredible photographs and artifacts from Ground Zero. Our tour was small with only 8 people which was nice as we could move around easily. The tour begins with 2 short videos, then each person gets a headphone with an audio remote. You move from one item to the next at your own pace and hear commentary from Gary Susson, the photograper. The items are displayed very professionally with numbers. Our tour guide, Louis, gave us a very good introduction pointing out items not to miss. We were fortunate that Gary was on site yesterday and graciously answered questions about his experiences.

It helps that group sizes are kept very small as the bulk of the time spent in the museum, which consists of 1 small room, is a self-guided audio tour of 100+ photos and exhibitions.

After viewing the work being done there, seeing the massive hole in the sky where the Twin Towers once stood, and reminiscing about our previous trip, it was time to go to our tour. It is a short cubway ride and short walk from there to the Ground Zero Museum Workshop. Upon our arrival we were led into a room that was lined with photographs and artifacts, all taken on 9/11 and at Ground Zero during the subsequent recovery process by photographer Gary Suson. Gary was there that day, introduced himself to the group and briefly outlined what we would be seeing/doing in our two hours there. What transpired from there was an experience I will never forget, a photo essay and narration of an insiders view of America's darkest day, and the subsequent recovery. Gary has us walking in the boots of those men and women who worked so diligently to bring closure to the victims' loved ones, and one can't help but be moved by the experience."

He was the only official photographer allowed at the Ground Zero site. Through his photographs, stories, and artifacts from the site itself, you can ultimately get a feel for the range of emotions felt. Although you can no longer see the Ground Zero site itself, the museum can almost make you feel as if you were there. The museum elicits an emotional response from almost everyone. It is very touching. Gary Suson's book containing pictures and stories that you see in the museum is a very special souvenir. As I sit and go through the book here in my home, I am reminded of the powerful stories and heroic people that faced that dark time in America's history. All proceeds from the museum and sales go to charities that help victims in some way from that day on 9 - 11.

Each photo and artifact grouping has a detailed narrative that can be heard through a hand held audio device that is personally controlled. This allowed each of us to go at our selected pace during the self-guided portion of the exhibit. Although the size of the museum is small, it has a significant amount within it. It took us approximately 2 \u00bd hours because we didn\u2019t want to miss a single narrative, photo, or display. We met the photographer, Gary Marlon Suson, and he took the time to answer many questions as well as share many personal experiences during 9/11. If you\u2019re in New York, the Ground Zero Museum Workshop should be visited. Such a cataclysmic time in our history can be difficult to present without dismay.

            "review": "Best Part of our NYC Trip. First learned of this tour through our Hotel Concierge, who raved about it - which made us skeptical as nothing ever lives up to the hype - but it actually was an amazing experience. We were suprised that 2 hours went by so fast but the stories behind the photos/artifacts were mesmerizing. We had our own guide who explained the history behind the museum, watched a short film and then were allowed to pick up + hold wtc artifacts - then we listened to the stories in the hand held audio units. We got to meet the photographer of the museum's images, Gary Marlon Suson, who had stopped in for a few minutes and he was very hospitable to us, answered questions and signed some photos we bought. Can't say enough about this \"experience\" (it's an experience not an attraction) and despite all the wonderful things we saw (and ate) in New York this is the one thing I will remember the most. Definitely go and see this exhibit - you won't regret it. Non-commercial and very intimate..."

Was slightly disappointed when entered the museum to see was only the size of a lounge but don't be fooled, the contents and displays are simply awe inspiring. You are provided with a audio tour handset and headphones after an initial introduction and allowed to roam at your own pace. You can not turn up on the day and expect to get in, this is available as an advance booking only. Tickets can be purchased via www.groundzeromuseumworkshop.com.I would definitely recommend you visit the website and try to arange time to visit during your stay. We were lucky enough to meet Gary Suson the creator and photographer on our visit.You are allowed to take photos if you so wish, but I found I spent more time listening to the audio for every display and felt this wasn't the place to take photos."

The stroies behind the photos and artifacts will leave you feeling like you were actually there. This museum is not very well known and relies on word of mouth, so go and visit and tell your friends. Money from the museum is distributed to several charites, one of which helps towards cost of treatment of the rescure workers who got sick after the recovery operation. A visit to this museum really made my trip and I am so glad we found out about it."

            "review": "So much more than I ever expected. I'd been to New York City many, many times before and peered into Ground Zero many times, too; but I had never heard about this museum until just recently, and decided to check it out.Nothing I could write here would even come close to capturing how many stories, how much emotion, and how much insight you will discover in this one room. Don't be fooled when you first walk in - it really does take 2+ hours to go through what's in there. The audio guide is done by the owner himself, and everything is presented tastefully and powerfully.Even if you've seen Ground Zero, you haven't seen anything until you see this museum. And even though you may think you've seen a million images of 9/11, you've never seen anything like the ones in here. It is truly a privilege that the public is able to get an inside view like this.$25 seems like a lot to pay for a one room museum, but by the time I left, I felt like it was worth so more than that. And I've gained a whole new appreciation of what it was like not only for those who were a part of the event, but also for those whose task it was to clean up over the following months."

The room is covered in photographs and artifacts from that day. each has a number which you type into on your self guided audio tour.. Although I didn't lose anyone in 9/11 I felt that I had gone on an emotional journey. The images and artifacts capture powerful moments, moments which should never be forgotten."

            "review": "Most meaningful experience in New York. My daughter and I have just returned from a weekend visit to New York City. This was our first visit to this metropolitan city and we had many things that we wanted to do and see. We both have a strong interest in people, their experiences, their feelings etc. so a trip to Ground Zero was at the top of our list. As I was doing some research for our trip, I ran across the \"Ground Zero Museum Workshop\" located at 420 W. 14th Street (between 9th and 10th Avenues) in Manhatten. This \"attraction\" is a gallery compilation of images and remnants from the Ground Zero Recovery that was produced and curated by Gary Marlon Suson-the official Ground Zero Photographer for the Uniformed Firefighters Association. He is the author of the book \"Requim: Images of Ground Zero\".When photographers were banned at the Ground Zero site approximately 2 months post 9/11, Gary was invited to come onto the site with camera in hand to document the remaining months of the recovery effort. He captures many very powerful and poignant images that each tell a story relating to the individuals and events of 9/11. The gallery space, however small, was packed with 100 separate displays (either photographs or groupings of actual items recovered from the site). Each display is accompanied by a self guided audio tour narrated by Gary Suson. A video of images and his actual CNN interview started the tour, then everyone was left to themselves to look, absorb, and reflect on the events depicted in the displays. The tour is supposed to be 90 minutes, yet my daughter and I spent 2 1/4 hours going through the gallery , listening to every one of the audio exerpts. Following our self guided tour, we were allowed to photograph items in the gallery space.It was alot to absorb in one afternoon, yet for me was more meaningful than our visit to the actual Ground Zero site, which we did following the \"museum\". Prices are very reasonable andit was money very well spent. I highly recommend this attraction to all visitors to and residents of New York City."
