It was relaxing just sitting on the concrete wall that lined the edge of the beach.What to see: there's a lot to see. Loads of restaurants, little boutiques, grocery stores and souvenir shops.Some Tips: - It gets chilly near sundown, so bring a warm blanket or a good jacket.- I'd say bring cash if you can. $30 would be enough to enjoy half a day there."

We walked along it, paddled and jumped the waves.One highlight was when my husband and I went out at 7am for some milk from Coles. The beach was busy with joggers and swimmers as we went to the shops. We bought a coffee on our way back to the house and when we approached the beach a local said she could see the whales playing out at sea.The beach was still busy and as we stood sipping our coffee on and nice Ocrober Monday morning we could see the whales coming out of the water a bit and the spray from their hole. We watched this for a while then we both thought \"how better to spend an early spring morning\" - you don't get that back in Scotland in October!!This is a lovely beach with loads of facilities, some other beaches are quieter up the coast but this has it all."

There are many restaurants, bars and retail shops right near the beach, so we enjoyed breakfast overlooking the beach. We walked through a Sunday market, then did the walk from Shelley beach to queenscliff. It was great to see hundred of children, doing nippers events for the surf life saving early on a Sunday morning. The beach was relatively busy with a mix of young to old locals, with a splash of tourists enjoying the sun, sand and chilling on the grass verges. A great place to relax, enjoy the view of the beach / coastline and people watch."

There was no where to sit and everywhere was busy so we had an ice cream for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant and we saw lots of people enjoying themselves but we found it too crowded so we left. It looks like a great spot to visit on a less crowded day. There are loads of cafes and restaurants all along the beach and some great surf wear stores as well."

Let me start by saying that the day of my visit could not have been more beautiful; the sun was shining brightly and only popcorn white clouds spotted the horizon. My son drove on this day and we came out of the car park into the shopping area, which on that particular occasion, was also full of stalls selling fabulous wares, like handmade jewellery, paintings and wood carvings. There are two sides to Manly, the area where you disembark from a ferry, to which we walked first and found the most bedazzling tranquil sea lapping against the golden beach - colours ranging from gold to acquamarine to emerald displayed in the sunshine. It was a pleasure just to sit on the boardwalk and absorb the beauty. If the view does not fulfill you, I highly recommend the chocolate shop inside the terminal building - heaven for chocoholics & some great gifts. Once we had experienced the quiet side, we walked to the other side of the precinct and found yet another stunning coastline with froth topped waves tumbling onto the sandy beach, more of a surfers paradise. This is lined with palm trees and a back drop of blue sky. Here we found a multitude of restaurants, all with reasonably priced menus and superb looking food and took a leisurely lunch. Onto Shelley Beach following this, a more secluded corner of this gem and from there my son and I decided to walk to North Head through the sanctuary; not a walk designed for flip flops I discovered but we did it on the spur of the moment so I use that as my excuse - it is long - make sure you have plenty of water - The walk offers stunning views, with plenty of photographic opportunities. Beware however, it is a long walk and seems to take a lifetime walking back (apparently you can get there by car !!) but completely worth it. I loved Manly and went back on my last day to just sit on the beach, enjoy the spring sunshine and watch the surfers, waiting with my phone camera to catch THE shot ! - Go, enjoy, feel the wonder - it is superb and you may even see a whale from a number of vantage points."

There is plenty of places by the beach to grab a towel, sunscreen or food if you forgot it! Not super crowded or touristy which was nice. You can choose what you want to do, lay, pass the footy, swim or surf! The water is clear and clean. You can take a ferry to get there which is fun to look at the sites, the only serious bummer is it has to be on an opal card and you can only top up in increments of $10 and we only needed to top up like 12 cents on our last day. That was seriously frustrating that you can't top your card up to make it what you want... so you tend to be way over on the money or under :/ otherwise beach is fun and worth making a little trip if you have time!"

Together with Bondi Beach the two most famous beaches of Sydney but I think there are more nice beaches. The whole town is super touristy with \"cheap\" (food wise simple, price wise expensive) restaurants and shops. The ferry ride to get there is my favourite part! And if you want to have a nice lunch/dinner, go to Hugo's on the ferry dock, really good food. Or head out of town to the South Head for a beautiful walk along the cliffs and hopefully see some whales."

We made lot of purchases for souvenirs from the shops, cheaper than the shopping area adjacent to Opera House. In the middle of the street are fountains and comfortable benches to take rest before heading towards Manly Beach. It is, indeed, one of the best beaches and the scenery around the beach and buildings and hotels gave a mixed impression of modern world in the lap of nature. We reached there around 4.30 p.m. and there were not too many people. We went for a long walk and enjoyed the fresh cool air in the beach area. Wished we had brought snacks, drinks etc. etc. and to lie down near the beach. This was, however, compensated by taking ice creams and walk around the beach.Took some pictures of this lovely tourist place. Would like to visit again Australia to stay there for a longer period. One week is insufficient to see the beauty of Sydney."

It is dangerous (sharks, rips and shore dumps) but not too dangerous. It is a great place to sit and watch nature, or to sit and watch people (which is possibly the same thing). It has lots of amenities and a great variety of good restaurants, cafes etc. from which to watch and eat. On a warm day it's hard to beat with fresh water showers and shade, walkways and ice-cream shops. Highly recommended."

At Manly, you can swim in the Harbour or walk down The Corso to the patrolled surf beach. Retail shops and cafes abound and there is often free entertainment and markets. A walk along the beach to the north leads to Queenscliff but you can also head in the other direction and walk the path around the headland. I would recommend take away fish and chips eaten while watching the surf or harbour. If pubs are more your scene there are a number to choose from."

If you don't have the one of the cards used to pay the fare, it will cost you a little more to get started, because there is a $10 minimum to get going, but it's well worth it.During a work trip to Sydney I had a free Sunday, so I bought a pass and took the ferry over to Manly Beach. The journey across the water made the trip a success from the start. It doesn't take long to get to Manly and, once your there, there is a nice promenade down to the beach full of shops and restaurants. On the day I visited, the beach was packed.

The beach itself has plenty of room but parking is difficult even on a less busy day. Manly is perfectly situated for the right amount of waves and sun. For beach/shopping stay around the main drag and you will find plenty of both. Tons of tourist shops and restaurants that are all good. If you are looking for a little more quiet, family friendly swimming, go further south around the bend and you will find it at Shelly Beach. Here the water is more protected and the swimming and snorkeling are wonderful. Overall this is a perfect area to get lost for a day or two on your next visit to Sydney. Dale - TravelingU"

I must say that although it was a funny day it was not what we expected it to be. First of all when we booked it we thought it would be a private class and instead it was a group of 15. Second, the instructors were more interested in flirting with the girls of the group instead of teaching. The only one that was doing her job was an Italian girl, that was really good and helpful. This was our second surf lesson, and comparing to the first one in Yallingup surf school it was very very average."

Best way to get there if you are a visitor to Sydney is to take the ferry. The ferry takes around 30 minutes and rhe fare won't break the bank. In summer, the beach is packed but less so during the week. The sand is golden and the water is blue -- what more could you want?"

I don't think TripAdvisor will let me post the same photos again.Great to get out of the city and see a Sydney beach, with the added bonus of the return ferry journey."

The beach is very tidy and good for swimming during Summer/Spring season i.e. between October to March. There are a few food joints close to the beach. Parking spaces are limited, so its advisable to use the public transport, i.e train and or ferry to reach Manly Beach. Overall it was a wonderful experience visiting the beach with family.

Spending a few hours here getting lost in the over commercialized shopping district or just people/surfer watching adds a great deal. The drawback is distance from Circular Quay. You have a few choices to get out there and all involve time and/or money. The ferry is the fastest and most direct route but several bus companies offer tour bus service to get out there. If you want to be on your own time schedule I recommend taking the ferry so you aren't rushed into leaving or forced into staying when you want to leave. To be fair, we visited during the winter so it has less appeal as a destination because only surfers with body suits were in the water. In the summer it would be a great place to spend time soaking up the sun and experiencing the water with the locals."

You arrive at the calm side, where tourists paddle-board and lay on the beach in the afternoon sun. A short walk and you are facing the Pacific Ocean, where some strong waves pound the shoreline. On your way to the ocean beach you will pass a wide array of cafes, restaurants and pubs all vying for your attention, at meal times. It is a great tour destination, where it doesn't take much effort to get there and if you don't want a return journey on the harbour, you can return to the City in a bus. I definitely recommend a visit, even just to walk barefoot on the soft yellow sand, on a sunny winter's day or a hot summer's day, it is a popular destination for day trippers. The ocean beach is quite long, if you like to walk in the sea air. Enjoy!"

It is such a beautiful beach/place with the Norfolk pines, gorgeous beach and cool vibe. It is the second place that someone should go (after walking around the Harbour/Sydney Opera house/Royal Botanical garden) - but it must be sunny when you go to Manly.The ferry from Circular Quay is lovely - 30 minutes of being in the Harbour (in the sun) - then you arrive at Manly and stroll along the main strip (with good shopping) that takes you to Manly beach. You walk along the length of the beach and admire the surfers and the beautiful setting. This time we had an amazing lunch at \"Salt\" and just enjoyed our outing to Manly so much. It really is a special place. We visited in late June - Australia's winter and it was a lovely, relatively warm day - about 18 degrees - warmer in the sun.If I am fortunate enough to visit Sydney again, I would definitely visit it again. It is a special place!"

Very popular and safe. There are life guards and there are areas you can swim in between the flags that are constantly monitored. The Beach is surrounded by public toilets, for your use, with showers. There are lot's restaurants, cafe's, shopping centre, large grocery shopping centre, lot's parking. The only downfall, it gets very busy and you have to pay for parking on the street. Unless you park in a shopping centre car park and you can get 2 hours free.

The fact that manly spans from the ferries on the harbour to the ocean gives you lots of options to shop... Eat and play... You can snorkel, scuba dive, swim , kayak and surf on one side of Manly or swim, take a boat out or ferry from the other side. There are plenty of walks along the water and around North head too which my wife and I did ... But it is long... And then there is Shelley beach... The coolest and best little beach I have had the pleasure of spending time at... If you have little kids... Come here!!!The pictures are from the coffee shop on Shelley beach looking at Manly..."

Also, there is shark nets which made me feel a little bit safer when swimming."

You can have a great meal at one of the many restaurants located across the street from the beach or pack a picnic lunch.

Bring your gear as you'll pick a spot and just chill under the sun. Restrooms are nearby and no-one bothers you while on the beach (unlike the Philippines were sellers are always pushing their wares on you. I live there). The water can be cold and you gotta watch out for the surfers. Don't become a travel story for the other tourists as you get taken out by a surfer...Fun beach, good mix of locals and tourists, and less than 45 minutes from circular quay via ferry. go and enjoy!ps...the shops close early...like super early (6pm) so be mindful of hours of operation)!"

The beach is probably my favourite one in the Sydney area \u2013 a really pleasant promenade to walk down or just find somewhere to sit in the shade \u2013 if it isn\u2019t already occupied that is. There is plenty of room on the beach and but beware of getting sandblasted when it\u2019s windy.

It is very enjoyable, the walkway even and paved, ok for wheelchairs. Benches along the way and a tiny grassed area between it and the street. The beach is pretty much flat and easy walking or lounging all the way out to water line. The street along the beach has restaurants and bars, a Novotel and smaller hotels.

The ferry ride across is a good way of getting to see the many bays in the harbour and some great photos of the Opera House and Harbour bridge.If you are thinking of going at the weekend, be prepared as the ferry can get very busy and there is often very long queues to get onboard, but going and coming back.The beach is lovely and generally busy at the weekends. Great to walk along the front and there are plenty of places t eat and drink and towards the East is another lovely little bay, which is safe for younger ones to swim."

Staying a few days in Sydney, Manly Beach was one of those places to visit on our list.It was so easy catching the bus from our hotel to the Circular Quay and a short walk to the Manly Beach ferry terminal. We even used the same Opal bus pass for our ride in the ferry to Manly. After the short ferry ride we entered into the terminal where several shops were preparing to open for the day. Opening to the main thoroughfare, there is a visitor center which provides helpful information. Crossing the street and to the right you can walk down Corso Blvd. straight down to Manly Beach. Shops line both sides of the of the street which can easily distract you from your main objective, the beach.Manly is a white Sandy crescent shape beach which invites you with the sounds of the waves breaking on the shore. There were people in the water enjoying all sorts of surfing and just getting wet. Many others were along the beach enjoying themselves.As we approached the beach there is a rode with vehicular traffic in both directions. We headed down to the right continuing along the coastline. This path takes you along the cliffs and many scenic spots where you will want to stop and take time to enjoy.There is a spectacular swimming pool cut out in the rock formation with seawater being pumped in. As you continue there are a couple small boutique shops where you finally come to the end of the path.This is Shelly's Beach! We had to make this trace as my wife's name is Shelly. There is a restaurant here for those who need to recuperate. "

We thought from reviews that Manly had upscale shops and cafes but soon discovered that perhaps our tastes thought it might be more of Palm Springs quality and not tourist gift shops and basic cafes with lots of fried foods. There are a couple of good shops and restaurants but they are few and far between. If you are going for a day in the sun and on the beach and grabbing a hot dog is fine, then this is your place. Waves can be big enough for a fun ride. All in all glad we went. Took the ferry using the Opal card."

It wasn't as picturesque was Bondi and seemed a little empty but it may have been because it was a little cloudy. The waves were quite high and saw some surfers. We spent some time hiking around the beach which took us less than an hour before heading back. It was a good day out.

The main beach is a 10 minute walk through the town and we took a pedestrianised street route past many bars,restaurants, cafes and shops. It was charming but touristy. The beach itself, like all of those on the seafront as opposed to within the Harbour, is exposed and windy, great for surfing and walking or watching surfing. We decided to walk around to the more sheltered Shelley Beach which was a pleasant 15 minute stroll and we were told that there are other walking routes around the headlands. Personally, I found it a lovely beach for a bracing walk and people watching but too windy for lying/sitting on. We did enjoy our visit though, a young, buzzy and busy spot, popular with backpackers and shoppers, but we wouldn't go back. "

Long enough to contain THREE patrolled swimming areas -- always swim between the red and yellow flags! Many pubs, restaurants cafes and fish shops. A pleasant waterfront walk around the southern end of the beach to Shelley Beach. Plenty of tourist shops. Good nightlife."

When in Manly, it was a nice walk to the beach through the town with lots of shops and restaurants. The beach was all we expected and seen on all the photographs and in movies. Since it was not the swim weather, we spent some time lying in the sand and watching the surfers have fun, took a nice long walk along the whole length of the beach and had a nice meal in one of the cosy restaurants close to the beach. Then we did some shopping in small shops along the Main Street. The last ferry to Sydney runs rather early in the afternoon, so be sure not to miss it. All in all we spent a nice day on Manly Beach. I can recommend it to everybody who has time to do the same."

Manly beach is very large with a number of rest rooms and changing stations for you to change into your swimming suites. the waves and the water were awesome but you must swim between the signs set up on the beach for safety reasons.

Bondi is better for swimming (Manly is often rough with rips and the swimming is squashed into a small area where the lifeguards patrol - lots of whistle blowing and often loud music!). However, a great day out and worth it for the ferry ride from CQ. There is also a summer ferry from Watson's Bay (where I live) if you prefer quieter and calmer harbour beaches. The best thing to do is walk to the south around to sheltered Shelly Beach and snorkel from there...it is a marine reserve with LOTS of fish and very safe and sheltered - you can exit from the stone stairs if you don't want to swim far. Sit in the shade under the Cabbage Tree Palms and look out for the gorgeous local lizards (water dragons), there are also excellent bush walks around North Head."

Although the Corso and the hard stand directly opposite it are always crowded the sand tends to be not so crowded and there is enough of it to get away from the crowd anyway.The walk around the south end is always worth it with the little cafes on the way and then Shelly Beach with it cafe/restaurant as a reward at the end of it.Most places in the City have changed beyond recognition since I was a \"tacker\" (a little child), but Manly still has its coastal cool vibe going strong."

If you are in Manly on a Sunday, get there early and watch the Bold and the Beautiful swimmers leave Manly at the very southern end of the beach, for Shelley Beach at 7am. Their pink cossies and caps are quite a spectacle. This club is in the Guinness World Record books, as they have swimmers swimming everyday of the year! There is so much happening on the beach during the morning, from volleyball to Nippers to boat crews training, it is fantastic! Coffee and great breakfasts are available at any of the restaurants and cafes across the road."

About 4 in the afternoon the heat of the day was gone and the views were superb. Plenty to see with a few surfers out, some volleyball folks playing a few metres from the sea and dozens of people like us just walking along enjoying the sea air and views."

A corso that is made for strolling or exercising with shops, people, beach time buzz. There's a shopping mall that has live performances and buskers, restaurants (both indoor and outdoor) and a hubbub that leaves you feeling you're on holiday. No matter whether it's summer or winter, this seaside town right of the harbour only half an hour from the centre of Sydney is an amazing gettaway experience.

Bondi Beach is easy enough to get to from the center of Sydney- a train to Bondi Junction and your pick of buses to the beach- but Manly Beach can be gotten to simply by sauntering into Circular Quay and hopping on the big ferry for a 35-minute cruise. So instead of being packed into a bus or a train car you get a cheap tour of Sydney Harbor (granted, on a busy day you'll still be packed, but at least you get some fresh air...)Manly has a classic beach-town setup with a long straight (though narrow) beach backed by pavilions, an esplanade, and town full of little shops and restaurants (and a bunch of mid-rise flats and hotels- eh, nobody is perfect). Completing the view is a row of pretty Norfolk Pines that line the main beach street. It's only a few blocks and a straight shot between the ferry terminal and the beach.Bonus trip: If you walk up to the end of the beach, cross the inlet, and walk through the neighborhood on the bluff you come to little Freshwater Beach, It's not as scenic but also not as crowded as Manly."

The beach itself while large was extremely crowded. The foreshore streets looked old and tired. The worst thing about it however is the parking. It took us and age to find a space and then had to pay the ridiculous amount of $16 for 90mins. That is an outrage. Your not providing a valet service or even undercover parking, its street parking and it was Sunday. being from Brisbane its the first time we have seen parking meters being enforced on a Sunday.My advice is if you want to see nicer beaches and not have to pay for street parking on weekends come to the Gold Coast. Or if you are prepared to drive 90mins south go to the northern beaches of Wollongong which are also much nicer."

When the out going wave, (The tow is so strong it makes a small out going wave) meets the incoming wave it makes a rooster tail water spray all the way down the beach. Don't plan on swimming, the under current and rips and deep holes make it great for surfers but not swimming. The food in the area is great. There is a great fairy ride from Central Quay and a short walk. Steps going down to beach. Australia is not friendly for those with disabilities."

I think the land-bus or car will take much longer. With this in mind, do not take the last ferry out of Manly! If you leave by ferry, try an hour or more before the last one. Hundreds of people try to leave at the same time.Anyway, Manly beach is a long, sweeping beach, with swimming allowed near the south end. Most of the middle is dominated by constant waves, swells, surfers, and life guards whistling--if you hear the whistle near you, and you're swimming, you know you need to stop. Most people who aren't surfing, just wade into the water to cool off. There is a lot of beach to lay upon. Restrooms for changing are here and there, but quite visible along the sidewalks. I have to say, eye-candy is abound here. I'd assume, many people come here to: Show off a beach body, surf, and sunbathe in that order.There are Blue Bottles, or man-of-war jellyfish. They aren't the kings of the stinging world, but they still hurt. So be aware of them, as they really can be quite huge. As a courtesy to others, it might be best to bury them under the sand so others don't trample them. At night, the waves will carry them back out to sea. The Corso nearby will provide you with all the food and drinks you'll need. Along with some interesting entertainment. The Valentine's Day I visited, there was a three-member boy band, literally in their early teens, like eleven-teen, singing songs from the 70s and 80s, because, you know, all kids like songs made twenty years before they were born. And they were quite good.Anyhow, the protected side of Manly has a beach near the ferries which is better suited for swimming, smaller waves, etc. So that's also an option nearby, but you'll miss out on--the beach bodies, the surfing, but you can still get the sun-bathing down."

On the other side most of the beach is for the \"real\" surfers even for the most unexperienced ones.But said that, the trip with the ferry is great fun, there are plenty of hikes around, lots of shopping and eating."

Be careful of the tides, shellfish underneath of sands also."

After a morning of sightseeing we decided purely on impulse to jump on the ferry to Manly from Circular Quay. The morning had been fine, sunny and 25 degrees. Unfortunately as we arrived in Manly the weather started to turn for the worse and it became windy and overcast. Nonetheless we made for the beach, which was very impressive, and paddled briefly in the cold sea. We checked out some of the shops and called in for a drink in a bar on the sea front where it was very busy, it was late Saturday afternoon. By now rain had set in, the temperature dropped considerably and it became very cold (it was as though we had been transported home to London). We decided to head back to our hotel in Sydney so sadly we were unable to make the most of our time in Manly or its beach."

First the beach has all you want in a beach, lots of sand but also rocks to climb on and explore tide pools etc. There are fish swimming around the people, that is kinda cool. But the real great thing about Manley beach it the walk to the beach from the ferry to and from down town. IT is a 2 block walk lined by stores with anything you would want, including 2 Coles. You can buy all you need for a picnic on the beach at a reasonable price or spurge and enjoy the many good restaurants. I cannot think of a better beach anywhere in the world."

If you are like me, you will have been lucky enough to drive down the South Coast to find your own personal beach, but you must not compare. Considering this beach is in a city, it is fantastically well cared for and everyone behaved remarkably well. Compared to UK seaside towns I would say it is less tacky and not quite as outrageously expensive to wine and dine around. If you are staying south of the harbour, I certainly recommend taking a ferry."

The Bondi to Coogee coastal walk is beautiful but those two main beaches were far too packed and even the smaller ones in between had a lot of visitors. Manly is beautiful with great views, great waves, and an overall wonderful vibe with lots of shops and restaurants along the Manly Corso (like a boardwalk/pedestrian mall) and nearby. We went to Manly Surf School (highly recommend!!) our first day and then surfed again with rentals the second day. The waters at Bondi or Coogee would have been way too packed to surf and Manly was just perfect all around.It is hands-down my favorite beach in Sydney and is also one of my all-time favorite beaches ever. Would absolutely recommend this for your swimming/surfing/beach day in Sydney!"

With the ferry from Circular Quay and the beach it really is world class as a day out. I now live in Sydney on the North Shore and Manly is a bit of a nightmare as the only way to get there is to drive. Parking spaces and prices are a nightmare - on a sunny weekend, finding a parking space is a major challenge and can easily cost $20 for a couple of hours. If you are visiting Sydney and can get to Manly via the ferry, do it - absolutely. It is up there with Star Ferry and Staten Island Ferry as cheap public transport accessing stunning places. If you've hired a car, leave it at the house/hotel and get the ferry. Loads of places to eat and drink. I'd recommend the 4 Pines Brewery for both. Other end of the \"Corso\" from the beach, but great beer and food, with a less touristy feel than some places near the beach."

But the issue is, there are currents, big waves and sometimes jellyfish.The lifeguards will keep an eye out and tell you where to swim and what to watch out for but it's not very relaxing. You HAVE to be a strong swimmer. And don't bother if you don't like waves; most of your time in the water will be spent fighting them anyway. Good thing is, there is more than enough space for anyone as it's HUGE!"

Cool water, golden sand and slightly sheltered. Living the dream!A very respectable 3.406/5 for Manly nonetheless."

It is a pretty long beach so everyone is quite spread out. We paid $10 each to rent a sun bed for three hours, which we didn't think was too bad, but if you are organised you could take your own towel and just find an empty spot to lie down, of which there are plenty. You could also hire towels, deck chairs and other beach equipment. We just wanted to relax and enjoy the sunshine for a couple of hours, but there is plenty to do out there should you wish. There were people surfing, body boarding, swimming, playing beach volleyball, table tennis and skittles.There is a 'safe' swimming area, which the life guards keep a watch on, but you can go elsewhere if you are confident. The lifeguards do tannoy the beach occasionally to remind people outside the safe area that the under current is strong and to move back in unless they are confident surfers.The beach is really clean and they have litter wardens, who I presume make sure that people are not dropping rubbish. There is free wifi along part of the beach and there are public toilets which are ok, just needed a tidy up, but had soap, water and toilet paper!If you go to Manly you can't really miss the beach and you certainly wouldn't want to."

Note: only one public restroom to use or change (and horribly dirty, disgusting, fifty probably from the homeless people).I managed to take a quick swim in a destination swim area, due to the strong currents, before the lifeguards shut down the beach for strong ripping waves.

While it is a reasonably attractive beach, it can't be forgotten that it is a city beach, and our experience of over-crowding will not be uncommon - I'm sure there are quieter times where you can appreciate the place (as I'm sure the locals will tell you), but the time we visited was not one of them.Walking from the ferry terminal along the Corso to the beach was like queuing for a footy match - we were all following the crowd like lemmings. Every food venue along the Corso absolutely packed, and with big queues. A very unpleasant experience on a 37 degree day.When you get to the beach and swim between the flags, you're crammed in with a shoe horn, and have about 2-3 square metres of water surface to yourself, which is not much when the rough surf is bumping everyone into each other. Quite simply, no real chance to swim or any other aquatic activity (leave your boogie board at home) other than getting wet.The big positive of the day is the ferry ride from Circular Quay to Manly, which is incredible. It is worth going just for the ferry ride alone, even if you just turn around a go back."

It was also our first time to experience December on a hot season; more like summer if you ask me! The beach was perfect because at that time it was a bit cold. Strolling along the beach with the cold breeze was wonderful even though the sun was up. You get to see so many people walking in bathing suits in coffee shops and restaurants-- everywhere as the beach was just nearby. Cars were lined up starting at 7am.. and got pretty crowded and traffic at 10am. Some people were playing volleyball or having a picnic or just a walk with their toddlers. The area was meant to make you relax. It was very clean with lots of friendly people. The area has hotels but the ambiance was resort- feeling. It was pretty laidback and enjoyable."

For people visiting Sydney, Manly is a bit like famous Bondi, but without quite the hype, only a portion of the tourists and an infinitely nicer journey there (the Manly ferry as opposed to the Bondi bus!). From the Manly bus terminal or Manly Wharf, don't be fooled by the two pretty beaches either side of the Wharf, for neither of these is Manly Beach (though both are lovely). Instead, walk through Manly along the very touristy Corso to reach the Pacific Ocean and the \"true\" Manly Beach. A walkway/bike path runs along the full length of \"Manly beach\" (divided into \"Queenscliff, North Steyne and South Steyne beaches from North to South, but it's all the one stretch of sand). Most people cross the road and stop at the beach there. What a mistake. If you turn right (keeping the Pacific on your left), you can walk all the way around a pretty cool promenade - Marine Parade - to delightful little Shelly Beach. Shelly has a private feel, is shady (good on hot, sunny days), is sheltered from the ocean swell so there are almost no waves (great for little kids), is amazing for snorkeling (it has a cool-water reef and aquatic reserve) and a nice little cafe/restaurant (The Boathouse). Or, you can turn left (keeping the Pacific on your right) and you will pass the up-market Pantry restaurant which gets good reviews but is pricey. Further up you will reach the North Steyne Surf Club which houses the Manly Surfing school (excellent surfing lessons from great staff), and the beach volleyball courts. If you keep walking to the end of the beach you will reach Manly Lagoon (not for swimming unless you are one of the many dogs running around like mad-things here) and it's kids playgrounds or you can keep to the coast (probably crossing the tidal stream to the lagoon - look for schools of fish here) and reach the Queenscliff ocean pool which is a great spot for a \"pool\" swim. The length of the walkway is shaded by huge pine trees and most of it is grassy, so picnics are an excellent option if you want to avoid the expensive restaurants which line the road facing the beach. If you do want to spend some money, there are some great bars and eateries. Skip straight past the crowds downstairs (don't be put off) at the famous Steyne hotel on the corner of the Corso and head upstairs (there's a lift) to the classy and secluded Blacket's Bar or the even cooler outdoor patio overlooking the beach, at the rum and cider bar (Moonshine), I think this is one of Manly's hidden gems and has live music some nights. Nearby Hemmingways is good for coffee. There's more, but I should stop. Contact me if you want more info. Enjoy."

If you can, try to spend a night at a hotel along the beach such as the Seable which is beautiful, modern and right on the water.

Manly Beach is a short wondrous ferry ride from Circular Quay in Sydney where for around 20 -30 minutes either by slow or fast ferry one can experience sailing through beautiful Sydney Harbour before arriving at the foreshores of Manly. Manly township is situated between Sydney Harbour Beaches at the ferry wharf end and a 7 minute walk down the main street, Manly Corso, leads you to the magic of the Pacific Ocean and a beautiful stretch of white sand which is Manly Beach. It is a surfing beach and there are three sections of safe surfing and swimming supervised by lifesavers. There are many and varied eating places that would suit both budget minded travellers and there are upmarket eating places as well for those who may wish to have a glass of wine and a hearty meal. To the right of Manly Beach there is a beautiful 20 minute walkway along a winding promenade to Cabbage Tree Bay which is both scenic and relaxing. There is a swimming pool on the way around as well as cafes that suit all budgets. There is a picturesque small beach at the end of the promenade walkway surrounded by parkland and benches to sit back and enjoy the scenery."

Some people were snorkeling, some were surfing, some were swimming, some were sunbathing, and everyone was having fun! There are many shops and restaurants nearby just across the street from the Manly Beach esplanade. Unlike some other beaches, there is a good assortment of shops (not just t-shirt shops) and restaurants if you need a diversion from the beach. The beach is deep and wide. The surf was rough, but not overwhelming. Take the ferry from Circular Quay, and visit Manly Beach. It is nearly perfect!"

It isd a great place as it has a village atmosphere yet is only a short ferry ride to the City, Having a car you can also get to the northern beaches. There are great walks. On the foreshore there is a walk to Shelley Beach but on the harbour side there is a 10Km walk to the Spiit through bushland and beach. Manly beach itself is ok but it was disappointing that with a vast expanse of beach the only patrolled swimming areas were at the far south and far north of the beach. There are Volley ball nets and there are clean public toilets."

No pebbles to hobble over, no sore feet getting into the water and lovely lovely white sandy beaches. Manly is certainly one of those. It is only a short 5 minute walk once you get off the ferry and you are there. You do need to ensure you swim between the flags and take notice of what the life savers tell you. We have volunteer life guards in OZ who give there time to watch out for people in the water and make sure they don't get into dangerous situations. They can't be everywhere though so it may seem like the observation area is small but it is important to observe especially if you have children with you or you are are not a strong swimmer. The currents at Manly can be strong and the pull of the surf can unbalance you if you are not sensible. In saying that body surfing, body boarding and surfing are such fun as long as you take notice of local advice. Wear sunscreen if you are out in the sun for more than 20 mins and wear a hat, t-shirt or rash shirt. Coffee shops and eateries line the beach and folk are all out for a good time so ENJOY!"

The beach is several miles long, with beautiful sand and water. It is bordered by restaurants, bars, hotels and condos. There are usually rather big waves good for surfing. The problem with this spectacular beach is that the swimming areas, defined by flags, are unreasonable small, often no more than 100 yards, so that the swimming area is crowded and even dangerous. For a swimming you may consider Shelly beach, a 15 min walk toward the south."

It's a great day trip over to Manly if you are staying in Sydney but I preferred some of the other beaches on the island to Manly beach itself. Manly beach is really popular as it sits in prime position at the end of a strip of shops, bars & restaurants which means that the beach is really busy and you will struggle to find a spot to yourself plus, you will be stalked by seagulls if you have any food and there will be a constant stream of base heavy music pumping somewhere nearby. What didn't help matters but is just an unfortunate coincidence was that there was a HUGE number of blue bottles on all of the beaches on the island the day we visited which meant that swimming in the sea was likely to end with a few stings!"

It's a very clean beach and since it's a long beach, there is more than enough space to relax without feeling like you're surrounded by heaps of people. Even during the holiday season, it isn't overcrowded. If you want to sunbathe in a quieter area, I suggest walking down towards the end where there are less people, because the most crowded area is right in front of the Corso (the shopping street leading to the wharf). Manly Beach is also a great place to surf and swim, and some people also prefer to walk their dogs or jog along the path that runs parallel to the beach."

The boardwalk along the beach is excellent. My family loved popping in and out of the shops, and we even found a great Thai restaurant that ended up being our FAVORITE meal of the entire Sydney stay (name of Thai place: Manly Thai Gourmet). My sister is gluten free and they handled that like pros! I love my Thai food - and have sought out the best Thai in NY, Boston, etc. I'd go back there if I get to go to Sydney again!Anyways, this is a review about the BEACH right? It's definitely worth going to. I love the walk around Bondi beach, but this beach is the nicer one to lounge in. It's more high class than Bondi and a great place to spend a couple days relaxing."

There seems to be plenty of places to sit and just relax.

Watching the sun rise or soon after is a must for tourists to see the early morning swimmers, in their pink bathing caps, swimming from manly surf club to fairy bower beach and back. On the walk you will see, hidden in the walk side gardens the water dragons posing for the tourists. Many mums and dads, coffees in hand pushing the little ones in prams and strollers, bike riders, and oldies (like me enjoying the fact they can get up and walk,) greeting the day with smiles.Manly is a real tourist spot and should not be missed, lots of cafes, take a ways and enjoying the ferry ride to get there is all part of a days travel exerience.

What a beautiful spot and a casual stroll up the Corso leads to many beautiful shops, caf\u00e8s, pubs and restaurants and Manly Beach. Even found a beautiful old welcoming church. There is definitely something for everyone here. I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant and Cafe prices there. Very affordable."

Manly has a bit more family chic feel to it, while Bondi is more a young crowd (Brazilians could compare this with Rio beaches of Leblon (Manly) vs Ipanema (Bondi), both great.

If you are a walking enthusiast, check out the harbour walks either to Shelley beach then up to the lookout to see our glorious coastline or a gentle stroll from the Harbourside of Manly west along the Harbour walk to Fairlight beach while enjoying the magnificent harbour views. If you stay overnight, be sure to visit the Quarantine station Ghost Tour. There are art galleries & a great aquarium at the western end of the harbour side beach.If you are more energetic, there is a walk all the way around Middle Head to the Spit bridge where you can catch a bus back to the city. You wont find better views anywhere.After expending all that energy, there are many, many restaurants, pubs & coffee shops coffee shops where you can sit & relax while admiring the scenery. All the above are located within a short walking distance of each other so once you get here, you will be spoilt for choice & wish you had arrived earlier or staying longer.A great day or more is guaranteed."

Let me tell you to forget Bondi with it's grubby side walks, small crowded beach full of backpackers & dangerous rips. Head for Circular Quay for a relaxing half hour ride on the Manly ferry, watching the length of Sydney Harbour slip by until eventually you dock at Manly Wharf. Cross the road into the Manly Corso & wander up the length of this beachside village until you get to the ocean laid out in front of you. A 1.5km beach spreads itself as far as the eye can see to Queenscliff. Turn left along the beach front & wander down towards the best surf life saving club in Australia. Manly Life Saving Club is the earliest surf life saving club on the north shore, beginning around 1903. Feel free to walk into this club house & view the amazing history of the club & that of swimming & surfing here. You'll be very welcome by any club member & most probably be invited up stairs to the awesome sun deck, which views over the length of the beach & further up the coast. This is a relatively safe beach, so have a swim, whilst our professional life guards watch over you. No lives have been lost on this beach for very many years. Wander back up the beach until you get back to the Corso. Cross the road & head into one of the oldest pubs here, the Steyne Hotel & imbibe a schooner or two of icy cold ale.

There is a nice seaside walk, although short and not meant for trekking. But a good view. I recommend to try the Copenhagen ice cream along the streetwalks; the ice cream was nice and huge."

If you're looking for a place close to Sydney that provides a variety of things to do, Manly is a wonderful place to spend a day, or to make your vacation base camp. On one side of town is a beautiful beach that during the summer is a great place to swim (lifeguards on duty). On the other side is a paved, waterfront esplanade where you can enjoy a walk with beautiful views of the Sydney skyline. In between are a wide-range of restaurants ranging from fast food to fine dining. We have enjoyed our visits to Manly so much, we're now talking about renting an apartment and staying there for a few months in 2017."

Other beach resorts stretch along the Northern Beaches to the northern coastal town of Palm Beach. Considered by locals to be the best beach for surfing, there is a school to teach surfing for first timers.It is a typically Australian seaside resort with locals having a laid back attitude and contrasting with lively activities like surfing, kayaking, playing volley ball on the beach and swimming in the sea between the marked flags. There are bike rides along the beach front or off road mountain bike adventure to Manly Dam. Manly Bike Tours offers 20 kms of dedicated bicycle tracks to explore this coastal town. There are whale watching tours during the season from mid- May to mid- November and walking adventures for walkers.Manly Wharf is a short ferry ride from Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay, on the Sydney Ferry which passes by the Sydney Opera House and the ferry journey goes across the harbour, round Middle Head to Manly. A short stroll from Manly Wharf takes one to Manly Beach. Manly is also accessible by public transport and do take note of the times when the Spit Bridge opens for boats to pass through.There are facilities at Manly Beach such as public showers and toilets and ocean swimming pool (Babbage Tree Bay). The beach is patrolled by life guards. The surf school is located at Manly Beach and conduct lessons for those who do not have any experience in surfing at all. Manly offers quality accommodation ranging from international hotels, fully serviced apartments, motels, guest houses and back-packer accommodation. Across road from the wharf is The Corso and Esplanade where the main shopping area and places for entertainment are located. There are many souvenir shops, restaurants, cafes, bars clubs, pubs, Takeaway Cafes and Internet Cafes. Manly Council Surf City offers free Wi-Fi high speed wireless broadband internet access from your mobile device at hotspot locations around the Corso, Manly Wharf, Manly Art Gallery and Museum and Manly Plaza. Known only to the locals there is a colony of \u201cLittle Penguins\u201d also known as \u201cFairy Penguins\u201d inhabiting a certain area at Manly Beach. These Little Penguins come out at night to play and dance in the moonlight. They are so cute and the baby penguins look like small furry balls. When one is lucky enough to be strolling along Manly Beach at night, the appearance of these penguins is an absolute delight! A group of volunteer conservationists have taken on the task of protecting these penguins from harm from humans, cats, dogs and foxes. When the weather has been bad and the penguins could not go out to fish for food along the shallow waters of the coastline, the volunteers brought fish to feed them. These people must be applauded for their dedication. The location of this colony is a closely kept secret to preserve this colony of penguins. This colony of penguins has been declared and protected as an endangered population.A visit to Manly is recommended for travellers who wish to experience a little of the lifestyle of this seaside resort."

The ocean can get a little rough at times so if you're not a strong swimmer definitely stay between the flags to make it easier for the lifeguards to see you in case you get in trouble. These guys and girls do a stellar job. If you're looking for a quieter swim, walk along to Shelly Beach and have a dip there- it's much calmer. Manly's a great place to visit on a sunny day and there's plenty of places to finish your trip with a cold beer/cider/ince cream/gelato."

Arrived in the Ferry terminus and walked through town along the Corso to the beach. Long stretches of golden sands with some surfing schools trying their best. The weather was hot and sunny and really brought out the best in Manly. The town itself is very touristy with a lot of tacky gift shops but overall the place is very good. Would definitely recommend."

The crowds on summer weekends and holidays can be enormous, but it is a definite 'must see' for visitors to Sydney with the ocean beach running from Queenscliff at the northern end to Manly at the southern end. But, it doesn't stop there as from Manly Beach the path continues around the water to Shelley Beach, a small but stunning swimming, snorkelling and eating spot. Then, of course, there is the harbour side where the ferry comes in, a picturesque scene with moored boats bobbing in the water, kayak & boat hire available, an aquarium and water slide & eateries aplenty including swish Hugo's and cheap eat Chat thai on the wharf, both with fantastic food.Walks? Everywhere, depending on fitness and preferred scenery but my favourites are up to North Head via the Quarantine Station and back down over the top ending at Shelley Beach. Stunning scenery, bush, historical sights. Food - well what do you want? It's here!! Every conceivable cuisine & often multiples of some. All along the beachfront, down the Corso, in the back streets and laneways & in nooks and crannies along the walkways. BIG CLUE - if you're visiting at peak times get an early ferry so you can enjoy the place before the hordes arrive."

You are literally across the road from the main shopping and entertainment district, which has so much to offer.

The waves were quite large as we crossed the mouth of the harbor, but settled down as we neared the ferry dock on the harbor side. A short walk across the isthmus past shops and restaurants leads to the beach along the open ocean. The street leading to the beach has been closed off to create a pedestrian mall. Several booths of art vendors were set up when we were there. Many has a wide sandy beach with a paved promenade separating the beach from the street.

You'll fit right in.Come by Manly Ferry from Circular Quay, it takes 40 minutes on the regular ferry. (Don't forget to buy an Opal Card for all your transport needs, they're great value).Or drive over the Harbour Bridge, taking Military Road through Mosman, over the wonderful Spit Bridge, and take a Right down Sydney Road to Manly. Watch it, though, it's hard to park. Try the Whistler Street carpark.Or take a bus. There's a big bus station right out the front of the Ferry Terminal. Some buses come straight to Manly, others terminate at Warringah Mall, where you can go across the road to catch another to Manly.If you can afford it, stay here in one of the hotels or guest houses. There's bikes to hire, and just so much to see and do....not to mention relaxation!One of the most beautiful places in the world, and a gem of Sydney's Northern Beaches.Perfect for families with children...a ferry ride, an aquarium visit, a beach play (on the quiet, still water side), an icecream and a stroll up the corso to see fountains, shops and have lunch. Perfect!A great place for singles, couples, families, friends...."

Or simply carry a blanket and throw it on the beach and relax!!We relaxed on the shelly beach for a while and then started stroll up to the lookout - beautiful views of the Beaches. So wonderful to sit at the lookout and gaze at the sea. We could do it all day, but it was time to leave. We took the ferry back from Manly to Circular Quay.

Also enjoyed watching a national youth life guard competition which clearly evidenced how serious the Australians take their sea side safety.Picturesque and surrounded by fun places and great people.You have so much to choose from but we had a great time, food or drinks at a number of places. Breakfast at The Pantry was wonderful. Fantastic well prepared food and a gorgeous beach side view. And for the surf shop people...a must stop is to visit Mark and his Manly Long Board surf shop. Great gear and hand screened \"tees\". Suggest later going up to roof top bar at the Hotel Steyne. The Steyne has bars on 3 levels and are great at pouring for all tastes. But upstairs is the darkened old rum bar; a good selection of regional Aussie draft beer , and maybe the best selection of draft ciders in the Sydney area...plus a great view from the outside balcony."

            "review": "Absolutely Beautiful.. My friend and I went here an Sunday afternoon a couple of weeks ago and we traveled by ferry (see earlier review Gorgeous View). Since we traveled here on a Sunday it really wasn't expensive at all, but it would cost a lot more if we had gone any other day of the week. Like seriously a lot more, so go there on Sundays! If you go there during the Australian winter you should definitely bring a jacket or sweater or something as it is quite windy. And you shouldn't take a swim since the water is freezing. But this beach is absolutely beautiful, I definitely regret not bringing my good camera, there were some gorgeous scenery. Even though it was winter the beach and it's surroundings were quite active. There were people everywhere (not too many though) and I'd say they were all quite young, late teens to late twenties. So it's a good place to go to be social and make friends. There were also loads of ice cream shops (we visited one of them) and nice restaurants and small shops. There's also some nice Swedish shops in Manly, which I'll definitely visit the next time I go there to stock up on Swedish candy. This is a must if you go to Sydney, it's lengths better than Bondi since it's not as touristy and over-priced. This will definitely be my beach of choice in the summer."

You can get there by road, but why do that when you can catch the famous Manly Ferry? Families love to have children's birthday parties here, travellers love to explore the coastline and harbour and in the Summer, have a surf. Pubs abound, walking plazas abound. You want fairy floss, they do fairy floss. Up the hill is the gateway to the North Head National Park. Manly is the beginning of the swathe of North-side beaches for which Sydney is famous. Go by ferry, plan to spend the day, take you sun protections and take your camera."

On a sunny day, catch the ferry across the harbour - you will see many of the more affluent suburbs, the Heads and beautiful views. When you arrive at the pier, what you see is NOT Manly beach as some tourists thought (they were underwhelmed and stayed on the ferry -thought they had seen it already). Follow the crowd and walk through the the Corso- some cafes, restaurants, children's play areas and shops - then cross the road to the beach. Take a walk around the esplanade, either North, South or both-all good. If there is a cool southerly wind, head around to the south and sit in the sun. All flat walking, ideal for older people and prams etc, sand galore for littlies. Plenty of options for lunch or snacks, markets on Sunday. Better than Bondi for a day out!"

There is a way to reach to the top of the cliff. Once you reach at the cliff, you get a panorama view of the beach and the sea from a height."

Always a hive of activity with board and body surfing, nippers activities and beach volleyball on the beach, and cafes, restaurants, shops and markets across the road from the beach. At the height of summer there are often surf carnivals and promotions happening. The atmosphere is somewhat cosmopolitan and it is almost mandatory to walk a dog (or dogs)! There is a scenic walk starting from the Queenscliff Surf Club all the way to Shelley Beach, which was voted one of Australia's most beautiful beaches. At Shelley Beach there is paddle boarding, snorkelling and a connection to another walk up to North Head. Definitely worth the effort."

Just even getting there is a major experience - take the ferry from Circular Quay in Sydney, journey past the iconic Opera House, and head out to Manly. Then, when you arrive, follow the crowds along The Corso (Manly's main street - pedestrianised, too) until you come to the ocean beach.Once there, behold the surf! And if you love the sun, sit on the beach; if you prefer the shade, there are plenty of trees to protect you from the rays. Plenty of foot-shower points are positioned along the beach after your sea adventures, and then nearby are countless shops and restaurants. Manly... one of the great Oz beach experiences!"

People go there for surfing, shopping, dinning, picnic, or walk along the coast or Sydney Harbour National Park. I took a 30-minutes ferry ride from Circular Quay to Manly Wharf . It was a natural beautiful scenery during the ride. This was the way to see Sydney. When I arrived Manly, I walked to the beach and there were many people swimming and surfing during the winter month. Then I continued wondering around, and saw this beautiful outdoor shopping district \" The Corso\". I picked up a Manly Scenic Walkway map from the Manly Visitor Central outside the wharf. I started walking along the coast. It took 4 hours walk between Manly to the Spit Bridge. I highly recommend this walk as you will see many different views and life of the people there. From the Spit Bridge, I took the bus to City Centre."

On the weekends and public holidays, there is Manly outdoor Arts and Craft Market on the beach front featuring locally made creations.You can reach Manly by a bus from Wynyard, but I prefer taking the Manly Ferry from Circular Quay near the Opera House. This gives a beautiful view of Opera house and Sydney Harbour. I have visited several times with my family. If you have a car, then drive up to the end of the beach to enjoy spectacular views at the turquoise bay.The Manly Beach is less crowded than Bondi. There are more than 75 restaurants offering cuisine from around the world. You can enjoy shopping while walking down to the beach from the ferry wharf."

It also apparently experiences regular rip tides, which can be dangerous for people who aren't strong swimmers.

We walked the beach however it was chilly so no swimming and then the horrible storms with 2 very large boats crashed onto the beach. :( But the sand was very pretty on a better day it would have been inviting. The restaurants were slim and the shops were not worth visiting however we went to the main walkway across the street and wished we had more time to play. Some very nice shops and found a good restaurant called FishMongers ticked away off the beaten path. Very nice! Inside/Outside seating with resonable pricing. Would like to go back there but the beach? I would head straight across the street. The best part was coming back into the harbor after dark. WOW!!!! Make sure you don't miss that one. The lights of the Opera House and bridge, the farris wheel...the whole photo is just beautiful!!!"

You will get lovely views from the water and when you arrive a short walk from the wharf takes you to the surf beach. I have been to Manly in the height of Summer when the shopping part looked rather a mess, simply because of so many people out and about. But this time we were there on a warm day in May out of school holidays and I found it much more pleasant. For a suburban beach it's impressive. Our children preferred the beach to Bondi. Lovely to sit and watch the surfers or go for a swim. It's a place to sit or swim and relax. Just chill out and watch the world go by then tootle back on another ferry and enjoy the ride."

Manly is supposedly where surfing the waves first began in Australia and it is still a main focus of the town today. Really enjoyed people-watching as we sat on a bench in the partial shade of a huge old Norfolk Pine tree with a hundred or more surfers trying their hand on the waves, some better than others. The waves weren't at their best as, although the tide was coming in, the sea was fairly calm. The lifeguards put out a couple of messages over the PA system as we sat there. The first was to urge people who were swimming to only do so at the South end of the beach which was the most sheltered area as this was the part they were watching and the second was to warn people that the incoming tide was bringing a high number of bluebottles - jellyfish - into the shore. Headed back along the busy main street to the wharf which is a hive of activity with restaurants and cafes etc. There are small sandy beaches on either side of the wharf offer a much calmer sea than the surf beach, much better for children."

The beach itself was great, cool sand when we were there, waves big enough for surfing out further, but you could also go out in the water without getting crushed. Great views on both ends of the beach and there were lots of places to eat across the street. The only drawback is after a big rain storm there's no swimming for 24 hours because the stormwater is drained into the water in the middle of the beach, so that could be annoying."

Manly beach was kind of disappointing compared to that. We heard that it rained heavily in Sydney the day before, and it was drizzling slightly on the day itself so maybe that was the reason the beach looked gloomy. There's also a rather unsightly sewer or water pipe from the town going into the water right in the middle. That alone would knock off one star. We took a coastal stroll to the nearby Shelly beach and while it was decent we didn't find it particularly great."

So, if I went back, I would choose a spot on the sand nearer these flags. Even the so-called \"safe\" area was pretty rough.

I was facinated to watch surfers dice with death (I thought, not being a surfer) then after an hour,return to their cars. dry off. put on shirts, ties and suits and drive away to their 'high powered' jobs in the city. What a life and what a sight. There are surf schools and instruction for most water sports i.e.. canoeing, kayaking, paddleboards. Cyclists can hire cycles for the day.Manly is a superb beach for all manner of sporting activities but also for a gentle stroll, as opposed to the Power Walking so in evidence these days. There are numerous cafes/restaurants along the beach road. I love the laid back atmosphere of Manly, which is more evident on weekdays.We love it because in the evening or a quiet morning, when the crowds have gone, it is simply beautiful.What we don't like- it's become too popular, too crowded.So forget all I've said good about it. Don't waste your time there. Find somewhere else. Please."

While visiting Sydney I took the chance to catch up with my nephew who has lived in Australia for several years, married a lovely Aussie girl and now has a young son. He suggested a day trip to Manly beach and we set off on the 30 minute journey by ferry from Circular Quay (NB a return ticket is $15AU - just less than \u00a310). On disembarking from the ferry we headed for the beach along what is known as The Corso and our noses quickly picked up on a delicious aroma coming from a fish n' chip shop where a queue had formed. A quick show of hands resulted in a unanimous vote to grab something from this shop and 'dine' on the beach rather than seeking out a restaurant or bar for lunch - and that choice didn't disappoint! SEE ACCOMPANYING PHOTO FOR DETAILS.The beach itself is pretty spectacular although I have to confess that I prefer the beach at Bondi. There, I've said it! However, I think that may simply be because when we visited Manly they were preparing for a big international surfing contest and there was a lot of building work going on on the promenade which was both noisy and a bit intrusive. That said, I much preferred the shopping area around Manly to Bondi, the latter being a bit too 'touristy' for my liking.All things considered, it was a good day out and Manly beach is certainly worth a visit - the ferry ride alone with its spectacular harbour views justifies the trip!"

An absolutely beautiful beach with a meandering walk way that leads you to Shelly Beach and hiking trails. When you get off the ferry across the street is an information center. Life guards are on duty where you will find surfers catching the waves, a large sandbar to walk out to and a netted swimming area that catch jelly fish and probably other undesirable critters. There are water fountains for filling bottles as well as drinking fountains. We purchased some fruit and a couple of snacks from Cole's grocery store on Wentworth Street before heading to the beach and hiking trail. When we were there it is a Sunday, up around 90 degrees and the beach didn't seem crowded at all. While walking around don't forget to look for the water dragons."

My first thought was to get out to the beach. I took the Manly Ferry from Circular Quay. Ferries run every 30 minutes. The hot and sunny Sunday I went, was also the 2nd day of the Australian Open of surfing, so ferry lines were very very long. The ride out takes maybe 20 minutes or so. You get off the ferry and pretty much walk straight into the main street of Manly. Naturally there is lots of touristy stuff, but just keep walking and you dead end into the beach. The beach is long. I only walked north and it still took some time. When I was there, it was the surfing event, so there was a lot of event stuff there. Otherwise it would be a pretty open area to walk through. I walked north to the surf club and cliff area. You can climb around on the rocks along the shoreline and probably even go further north, but I wasn't feeling adventurous that day. Theres lots to do on the main street and its offshoots too. Plenty of places to eat and drink. Shopping. There's also lots of places to fill up your water bottle and public restrooms."

It feels like going to a British beach...only without all the crappy amusement arcades and with far better eating options. Its what Brighton, Southend or Weymouth COULD be like. A nice long clean beach, nice and warm. On the shore there are loads of excellent restaurants and theres a great pedestrianised high street with lots of shopping. All in all, ignore Bondi. Its overrated. Instead, get the ferry to Manly instead!"

Then again perhaps I am biased because I live here.If you are taking a holiday do not miss Manly. take the 30 minute ferry from Circular Quay and plan to spend the day browsing through the shops on Manly Corso. Laze on the beach (making sure you use sun stop lotion) and take a swim in the Pacific Ocean.Manly is also a famous surf beach and a short walk from Manly Beach is Shelley Beach, which has fabulous snorkeling above coral reefs. This area is a national park, so some of the fish, including a giant groper, are very tame because they are used to humans.Manly has so many restaurants it is difficult to chose. But as you are near the beach, opt for fish or seafood. There are many great seafood restaurants, or a cheaper option is to buy your fish and chips from a fish and chip shop and take them to the beach to eat.But watch out for the seagulls. They are always looking for a free meal."

The ferry leaves from Circular Quay regularly (every 20 to 30 minutes depending on time of day) and passes the Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, various harbour beaches and points, beautiful harbour side houses, bush reserves and the 'Heads' - the opening to Sydney Harbour which can get a bit rough sometimes and give you a thrilling ride as the huge waves from the open sea rock the ferry from side to side. Also view the yachts, boats and ships as they move around the glorious harbour - on a clear sunny day it is magical. And Manly at the end of the trip is a little treasure - a mall of fast food shops, cafes, pubs and surf shops with the harbour down one end and the famous Manly beach at the other. Try to time your return so that you are coming back into Circular Quay at sunset with the Sydney Harbour Bridge as the backdrop. Magical."

Once back at the Corso , there are a stack of nice cafes to pick from -all good - or you could have a beverage at one of the handful of nice bars .There is a great aquarium on the harbour side thats worth a visit . While you are waiting for the return ferry be sure to pop into the wharf bar and meet the trendy locals. It can be a whole day trip , there is plenty to do and see. The trip across alone is worth it.

You have to take a ferry from the Opera House area which was a bit of a dash and busy as I went during the New Year period, but the ride was nice and you get to see another angle of the Opera House. Manly Island is really lovely and the beach was much nicer than Bondi in my opinion. Manly town was so charming too. I would definitely recommend a day trip out there. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes to chose from or you could just take a picnic and spend the day on the beach. Lovely waves and I saw many surfing schools out teaching beginners which was fascinating to watch."

Manly's iconic main strip, The Corso, has a wide selection of shops, pubs and eateries -make sure to grab a gelato.

Manly Beach was a lot smaller than I had anticipated, and the sand didn't feel as nice as Bondi Beach. It also happened to be incredibly windy the two times I went there. I don't know; maybe I missed something? It's not a bad beach, but if you're looking just for the beach experience (sun, tanning, etc.), I think you'll have a nicer time at other beaches."

Try to reach Manly using the ferries from Circular Queue. If you are staying in the suburbs, it will be a quite long journey (more than an hour to get there), but you'll have the chance to experience the effectiveness of city's transportation system and the landscape on both sides of the rivers that lead to the Sydney Cove. When leaving Circular Queue station, don't forget to look back and take a good selfie with Sydney CBD skyline as background. When at Manly, enjoy the walk at The Corso. Some goods at gift shops can be found with better prices compared to the souvenir-Mecca of Paddy's Market. Very nice restaurant at the left corner facing the shore."

I love the ferry ride over and back, strolling through the main street with its many shops, shaded places to sit and now little water fountains that you can walk through (good for getting the sand off your feet after the beach). The rip can be quite strong at the beach at times as it was when I visited a couple of days ago. I got slapped in the head twice by the waves due to not paying attention and it was quite strong and discombobulating. Trying to get out past the strong breakers exhausted me in the end, but I still went back for more later. I love the atmosphere on this beach; great scenery, clean and it's always interesting people watching. It's nice to return to the ferry via the side streets to look at the beautiful period buildings and then to top it off with an ice cream whilst waiting for the ferry back. There's some good eating spots there too. A great day out."

Busy, lots of bronzed posers, bohemian and very cultura\u2014but hot, and average for scenery\u2026lots of crowds, lots of buildings, not a lot of shade and the beach is nice, but it's just a beach. Whereas Manly is more like Sorrento, a bit more upmarket, lots of shady spots, lots of posers (of course) but more family friendly without feeling like your begging to get a spot of sand.Manly is a clean, scenic beach with good waves and clean sand. Yes, it gets crazy busy, but it stretches out for a long way, and you also have other little beaches tucked away during the tourist walks, that allows you to escape some of the madness. The foreshore is littered with trees on the eastside, and the lifesaving club provides taps and showers to hose off your feet and legs after trekking through the sand. It's a friendly beach that even offers beach volleyball and had loads of bars and restaurants along the main strips to give you that holiday feel. I love it here."

Another unique part of this beach was part of it is a penguin sanctuary in which the penguins come out around sunset/dusk. I missed the march, but I did get to see one poor injured penguin wobbling around and the volunteers trying to rescue him to get the fishing hook out of his leg. Manly has lots of restaurants in the area, and explore and ask locals maybe for the local spot to swim because all the sections I saw I probably would not have swum due to all the boats in the harbor."

We ate at Nando's because it was impossible to eat at Papi chulo because of the waiting time, but if you are willing to wait then sit at Papi chulo, because it has the best view of the Harbor."

Lovely restaurants, bars, shops, a great beach and good transport links.A lovely afternoon spent on the beach on Christmas day with our family.Fabulous family friendly New Years Eve free fireworks celebration at 9pm, which is very common in Sydney and you could see the city centre and Bondi's shows behind the hills in the distance too (Manly's seemed to be the best and longest by far!)"

Firstly if you have purchased an Opal Card for buses and trains you can use it for the Manly Ferry.Don't worry about the crowds there are heaps of seats available inside the ferry. The beach is great for kids and adults alike. There is a coles express across the road from the ferry so you can avoid all the overpriced shops on the ferry concourse. It is a lovely walk around Manly from front to back..only a couple of blocks. Ferries run constantly so there is not much waiting if you just miss the ferry."

And when you can do it with a group of like-minded people in one of the most beautiful spots on the planet, you are elevated to that blissed-out zone that fills you with awe, wonder and respect for the great goddess Mother Nature.It is possible to get this natural high every day at Manly, on Sydney's northern beaches, where a sea of pink caps can be seen on a daily return swim trek from the surf beach to the quiet cove at Shelly Beach. The Bold and Beautiful swimmers meet at the surf lifesaving club around 6.30am (the stalwarts head off earlier) and sign up for the swim that is around 1.6km return (that's my guess). Each swimmer is provided with a B&B pink swim cap. Less experienced swimmers might prefer walking around to Cabbage Tree Bay, the half way point in the swim to Shelly, to enter the usually calmer waters from the stairs.At 7am the peloton heads off from Manly and swims through the surf break to 'the point' where everyone stops and waits for the whole group to assemble. At a shout of \"let's go\", the pink caps head to Shelly where everyone gathers on the small beach backed by shrubby bushland. After another cry of \"let's go\", the swimmers head back to Manly. Along the way, there is an abundance of aquatic life to be seen. Rays, gropers, sand whiting, flathead, white bait, and god knows how many other species go about their daily business as the horde thrashes above them. If you're lucky, you might get to see wobbegong sharks and dusky whaler sharks. This marine reserve is a breeding ground for many fishies and a nursery for dusky whalers. Respect the shark and it will glide beneath you, slinky and sleek, not at all interested in the commotion.I love this swim and the people who do it. They are, each and every one, ecowarriors. I reckon you'd be hard pressed to find anything else like this in the world. There is an app for the Bold and Beautiful that can save you signing on each day, and it allows you to keep track of kilometres swum. Highly recommended."

But it's a great soft sand beach, filled with surfers, families, very clean, with lots of life guards, paved walkway above, green areas suitable for picnic, and water fountains designed to fill your water bottle. Thirty minute ferry ride from Circular Quay and a 5 minute walk from Manly Wharf."

So, after having Tim Sum at Market Place (above Paddy Market)(Tim Sum was great by the way), we headed over to the pier. Paid A$55 for the 4 of us (next time bring a kid, then it will only cost A$10 for 4 people on Sunday's ), took the ferry. Ferry ride was great. Beautiful Panaromic views of cliffs, boats, the bay. However , when we reached Manly beach, saw lots of people. BUT, the beach was dirty and laden with sea weed. Air stank of rotten vege. We walked the beach for 10mjns. The kids were not interested. Suddenly Laguna Beach in California came as a comparison. We decided to leave and walk the shops nearby, That was ok. 1 hour later, we were back in the ferry back to Sidney proper, Visit Manly beach only if you got nothing better to do, beautiful place if city decided to clean the place"

Of course, there were lots of people at the beach, as Bondi, but Manly had a more to give.

The southern end is good near the surf club which is our pick for a bit of an ocean dip with a coffee shop in the surfclub just a few metres away. If you're visiting and not surf savvy stay within the flags when swimming ,watch out in big surf conditions esp with your kids and you'll have a great time"

The ride was short 30mins ride from Circular Quay at costs us less than AUD20 per person return.We didnt bring any swiming gear which was a big mistake as the beach was a lovely calm ( not too strong currents) clean long sandy stretch ideal for young swimmers. Had to buy a new outfit after the little one got dirty & wet playing in the sand. Yes it is definitely nicer than BONDI as other reviewers have mentioned. Cleaner beach and calmer sea.  Lots of eateries and shops high end and affordable. Definitely worth a visit or even a STAY at Manly.Will definitely be back for more MANLY action !"

Apart from the odd wet or windy day, its a perfectly reliable, pleasurable and enjoyable place to be. Always clean, always attractive, Manly Beach is easily accessible, ideally by Ferry from the City. The perfect way to go to the beach, no matter what the weather, the Manly Ferries complement the Manly experience perfectly.

With the Opal Card, it is $2.50 roundtrip for the ferry ride on Sunday (Opal card price caps at $2.50 on Sundays) but make sure you go early to beat the crowds. The town was full of small restaurants, cafes and shops and you could spend a couple of hours just browsing there. The beach however is beautiful. There is a great beachwalk that goes quite a ways that give you different views every few hundred yards. The beach is clean and the weather was great the day that we were there (I heard it was quite windy the day before). Since we were just visiting, we didn't bring our beachwear but would definitely do so on a future trip. This would make for a full day of relaxation."

Here you'll see the traditional red & yellow flags, that the professional lifeguards put up on the beach, to indicate the safest area to swim. This is a fairly wide beach with very clean sands that are scoured by tractor each morning. You'll see people using it for family fun, jogging on the beach, both on the soft sand & down along the water's edge or even using one of the many volley ball nets & courts a little further up the beach.

After spending most of my childhood growing up in Manly I'd forgotten just how good the South Steyne beach precinct was for first time surfers. The beach shelves gently and is well protected from Southerly swells so it's not very often you get big waves - and that's what makes it such a good proposition for first timers. Manly Surf Lifesaving Club overlooks the flagged bathing zone and provides patrols to keep everyone safe in the water. Can get very busy at times, early mornings are best as the usual afternoon North Westerly sea breeze can be quite strong at times, blowing out any surf. So, give it a go, try a bit of body surfing and enjoy!! For those less adventurous souls there is a great walk along marine promenade from Shelly Beach to Queenscliff that puts you in touch with the scene and includes ocean pools at Fairy Bower (named after a colony of Fairy Penguins in the area) and Queenscliff."

It's much quieter and is a good spot for littler kids.At the south end of the beach there is a very pleasant walk round to Shelly Beach which is tucked in under North head, the access to Sydney harbour. At the Queenscliff end you can walk round the rocks to the next beach, Freshwater by way of a tunnel through the cliff.Manly offers so much more than Bondi - a range of options along the beach; busy and bustling, active, and quiet and it's proximity to the harbour opens up another load of activities such as windsurfing, paddle boarding, kayaking etc."

It's part of the Manly Beach experience I never miss. The trip over allows you a view of the best Harbour sights, Bridge, Opera House, Garden island, Fort Denison and past the Eastern Suburbs and the Harbour Heads.Arriving by Ferry you'll be greated by the wharf and its shops, plenty of food and the Aquarium, then its straight across the road to the Corso (main shopping street mall) and a walk past some amazing food, wine, pubs or take away shops (and icecream to kill for) as you head for the beach. The best restaurants for those wanting a quality meal and surroundings are along the beach front, with takeaways along the Corso.The beach is wide, orange sand and plenty of room to take in the sun or swim lose to shore or even body or board surf further out.

It is the first of about twenty beaches on the 'Northern Beaches' area of Sydney which start at North Head. Originally an area settled by the overspill from the city as people spent weekends in Manly and other beaches further north and then stayed and lived there permanently. Manly Beach has a lovely walk up \"The Corso\" from the Manly Ferry wharf to the beach itself. The Corso has ample shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants to keep everyone happy. The surf is about as Australian as anything, a little bit wild and fun enough for kids too. From Manly Wharf there is a very good selection of buses to take you to the other beaches further north. I think it's the 190 that will take you to Palm Beach, the northern most beach at Barrenjoey Headland, the \"Summer Bay\" setting for the Australian soap opera, \"Home And Away\". It is a journey of at least 45 minutes but takes you past every one of the beaches along the way. You'll look at the normal homes along the way and suddenly understand the expression, \"The Lucky Australians\"."

Manly beach is a good size and is backed by a long promenade with bars and shops the other side of the road. We were sight seeing so stopping here for a little while was enjoyable but personally I prefer quieter unspoilt beaches, but for those who'd rather have everything to hand then I should imagine this is a popular choice."

It arrives right on the doorstep of Manly, with only a walk across a road to get to the main street. Along the wharf many bars and restaurants now provide a fantastic location for lunch and dinner before the ferry back to town. Manly town center is a quaint 1-2 street affair. It is pedestrianized so very relaxed. Lots of great surf shops and drinking establishments with the prize of a wonderful surf beach at the other end of the main street.Well worth a visit if you're in Sydney for a few days!"

The best attractions in Manly are the ferry trip, the bars and the markets.Tips: - For something different, walk from Manly Beach to Shelly Beach - Ferries leave every 30 minutes, make sure you time your trip so you're waiting around. You can plan your trip at www.131500.com.au (the Sydney public transport website)- For a drink check out the bars by the ferry or for food, grab fish and chips and eat on the beach like a local."

Late one Saturday afternoon I got the urge to jump on the Manly ferry from the Circulat Quay and take the 30 minute or so ride over to Manly. My aim was to get to the beach there to watch the surfers. However, it was getting late and most surfers had packed it in for the day. That left the beach, at low tide with the life guards clearing up after a long, sunny day and the kite surfers skimmimg on the waves in the shallows. Boy, can they speed through the water. I sat for ever just marvelling at the skills of the guys as they spun through the water and sailed high over the surf. What a sight! Eventually with wind swept hair I reluctantly returned to the ferry so that I would be in time for my self imposed appointment with a restaurant in Darling Harbour that evening."

Whilst many of Australia's best beaches are ones that aren't well known to the general public and are often far quieter and less travelled, Manly Beach would have to be the pick of the mainstream beaches, particularly around Sydney.It has the typical beautiful views of many of our beaches, but often isn't as crowded as beaches like Bondi. It is still very well known and well trafficked enough though, that it plays host to a lot of events and is a great surfing scene. It does still have a tendency to get a little over crowded, particularly down the southern end, but at least up North Steyne, it's usually a little quieter...assuming it's not 35\u00ba+ and everyone in Sydney's by the water.It's not too far to get to, is relatively accessible and has plenty to offer near by too, which is qhy it ranks so highly in my beach list."

The walk along the path is easy for anyone, we saw a number of baby carriages, and canes, call can walk this. There are sea dragons to be seen along the path, but don't touch they are protected. There was a lovely salt water pool built into the rocks about halfway to Shelly beach along the path. A great place to sit and gaze at the ocean.

It's wonderful to wake up in the morning and watch the surfers, runners and cyclists before they go off to work and to enjoy an ocean stroll as well. Manly has some of the most scenic walks around the Sydney coastline. If you come with children they will revel in the beach activities and you can enjoy a quiet waterside coffee.

Trying to get used to the time difference, I woke up pretty early and am glad I go here when I did, which was around 830a. You take the ferry (I took it from Circular Quay, and you don't need to purchase tickets ahead of time, at least not for that time of day.) It took about 45 minutes to get there, but I believe there are faster ones. You can check with the people selling the tickets.When I returned, around 11a, the line to get onto the ferry was very, very long. Back to the beach. As soon as you depart the ferry station, on the left is a bike rental place and also a walkway that leads you through some lovely scenery. There is also a German style restaurant that has delicious granola and lattes!You will not have a problem finding a place to eat or sit and have coffee/tea and watch people stroll by. The entire area around the ferry station and on to the beach has lots of shops, restaurants and cafes.The signs to get to the beach are pretty easy. Just walk straight and you'll know when you've gotten there.I did not rent a bike as I'd planned because I couldn't find the place I wanted and when asked, people around there were not familiar with it. Also, a couple told me later that it's a waste of money because you don't see that much on a bike that you can't see on foot and there are a lot of hills. I did see a lot of hills.So back to the beach: when you get to it, you can go left or right and walk along a promenade. If you go right, you'll also have the opportunity to take a walk off the beaten path (although it's paved) and take in the beauty. You can also rent some paddle boats and there's a small area for children to play in as well."

No need to worry about parking or having to change buses or trains or whatever.And - because it's a NSW beach - guaranteed to be a great beach visit (not that I'm biased or anything....). If you have to go to Bondi for some bucket list thing, enjoy. When you want a nice beach day and be relaxed, Manly is the place to go."

It has just about everything a beach could offer - wide level beach, beautiful soft sand, safe easy stroll into the cool clean surf, stunning views up the coast and at one end of the famous, vibrant, swinging 'Corso' thoroughfare! The perfect summer combination really - beach is professionally patrolled, has fresh water showers, beach volleyball nets, convenient facilities and across the road from the historic 'Steyne' Hotel and a selection of world class cafe's, restaurants & bars. It's more commercial and busy than years gone by but this has only added to it's charm, vitality and cosmopolitan international appeal - this place can never be spoilt - fun, relax, indulge, a wonderful day out - go Manly!"

A doorstep to the scenic Manly-Spit Bridge Walk at least 4 hours with secret beaches along the way to dive and dip;3. A haven for joggers, swimmers, fishing, snorkelers, beach volleyballs, etc; and 4. A caf\u00e9 & restaurant paradise or order a take-away and heed off to Shelly Beach for R & R; and5. You can cycle Manly Beach and just quietly enjoy the sea breeze, the view, and nature.If you are a Hollywood fan, I am not, you could check out the Manly\u2019s Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel where Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban were married. Of course, many famous people have dined in Hugo\u2019s restaurant at Manly Wharf like Jack Johnson, P Hilton, etc but then you would rather have a 5 star food service.For solo traveller like myself, I wouldn\u2019t recommend an evening outing in Manly unless you are escorted by another fellow trusted traveller as the drinking culture can become almost like a New Year\u2019s eve celebration without the fireworks but all the brawls."

Many of the prices were cheaper than stores we went into in Sydney. Once on Manly Beach, there are many restaurants overlooking the water. We got onto the sand and into the water just as it started to rain, but we enjoyed the view and just being there. I'm sure it is great in the spring and summer!

Get the ferry from the city, it is such a lovely way to get to this beach. The huge Norfolk Island Pines that face the Pacific Ocean were planted in the 1880's and they are still so very special. They provide shelter and add to the atmosphere of the beach. If you head to the right it is South Steyne and a lovely walk along to Shelley Beach, the only west facing beach on Australia's East Coast. It is a pretty spot and very popular with families. In the middle of the beach is North Steyne and further along is Queenscliff. No matter which direction you take, there is plenty to do and see along the way."

If you like a walk, there are some great sight to be seen walking around Manly and surrounds. Catch the ferry either from or to Circular Quay and you will be delighted by the views. Manly is an eternal favourite for locals and visitors alike. Spend the day and you wont be disappointed. Spend a week and you will fall in love with the place."

Only one surfer could be seen on the beach and a handful of people walking near the shoreline. Instead of a blue Australian sky, everything was grey - the ocean, the sky, the light. Manly had a long boardwalk from the beach to the Manly ferry terminal. Lots of shops, restaurants and cafes. It does seem a shame though to escape into those venues because of the weather. I would suggest that every tourist visiting Sydney takes the Circular Quay to Manly ferry ride (and return). It is a relaxing, economical way to see more of Sydney than just the city, traffic, shops and congestion."

There is everything you could want, topped off with a beautiful beach with 'real sand' and tides that give you a challenge. As with most seaside resorts it is at its best during the Spring, Summer and Autumn. While a day trip is recommended it is probably best to take a direct ferry trip from Circular Quay - it is a third of the price you will pay for a 'organised packaged trip'. While I would recommend one of those 'trips', it is better to use it for some of the higher value trips. For example for 99 dollars you can get 1 + 2 venture/day trips. So better to not have a Manly journey included in this. But back to Manly. A really worthwhile visit and you can use it to bus around some other North Shore venues - Balmoral and Mosman. There are also as you will expect many nice restaurants and the food. for the most part, is good. A one way ticket will cost $7.50 per adult or $ 14 for a return."

When you approach the landing there is a nice restaurant, spots to rent Bikes and a small beach front area. It is a couple of blocks to Manly beach from the ferry landing, but a straight shot so you really can't get lost. The walk gives you a chance to see a little more of the local area. Manly Beach is an expansive soft sanded beach with adequate facilities. The boardwalk area is a good size and we met a few interesting locals. The setting is very nice with stairs leading down to the beach and water. After seeing and walking a little of the beach we headed back via the Corso which is a nice plaza like area filled with shops and restaurants galore. It is a pricey area for the budget conscious and we were in a rush so grabbed a bite at the ferry terminal where the offerings were presented like a food court - edible and suited our needs. We wanted to make the ferry ( almost missed it but the ferry workers saw us and waited - thanks guys :-). Heading back to Sydney as the sun was setting was a great decision, the ride was beautiful with many wonderful photo opportunities. As the sun is going down the lights in the harbor are going on, just spectacular so swapping one evening meal for that sight was a good decision on our part for sure. We are often in locations with beautiful beaches but this one was worth the visit...."

Alternatively grab some fish and chips or a kebab or just a coffee and one of the take away eateries. Can recommend them all haha.Take a stroll along the beachfront to Shelley Beach for a swim or snorkel...great photo opportunity as well.A cheap day out in Sydney to be had by all.

It had been recommended by a friend, so we decided to do it anyway and I'm so glad we did! We had seen many beaches in Australia, but this one was definitely unique. We hit the beach right at sunset and the waves were so beautiful and calming. The beach wasn't as crowded as I'd expected. So glad we went!"

There are a few rip-tides, but these are clearly marked - keep a watch out. If you feel yourself being pulled out, don't panic and try to swim back to shore, instead swim parallel to the beach - you'll soon be out of the rip and be able to head to shore without tiring yourself out.If surfing isn't your thing, there are volleyball courts and other beach activities available, plus lots of shops, bars and restaurants nearby."

The ferry ride (a bargain at only around $15 round trip) is like a tour of the harbour! We rode out at sunset and back in at night. Some of my best photos of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge are from this ferry. Once in Manly don't stop at the little beach you first see. Walk up the courso to the main beach. There is a great pub with 2nd story seating on the main road. Stop for a beer and relax in this great spot!"

We chose to utilize the Ferry for convenience, and it is only a 2-3 block walk from the Wharf to the beach.The great thing about the beach is that is very very long - and it during the winter months it is hardly crowded. I would imagine during peak surfing times, that this area could get quite busy.Life guards are around certain areas of the beach, especially down near their building (Southern portion). The beach is a nice soft sand, and extremely picturesque. Water fountains, filtered water filling stations, benches, volley ball nets, and even some small shelters line the beach. There is a boardwalk area lined with the native trees. There is a big effort to increase the population of the trees.There are many restaurants and hotels just across the street. The main concentration of food/shopping is right down near the South End.The only thing that was worrisome is that there are warnings about swimming after a rain (24 hours), and there are large pipes going out into the water. I am assuming that these are for drainage of the town, and that is why there is the 24 hour warning.Wish we would of stayed here a couple of nights instead of just visiting."

Huge crowd awaits us waiting for the ferry but we're impressed by the system of boarding, and the attitude of passengers to go with the smooth flow. We enjoyed the sights of Sydney and haven't experience any turbulence except maybe 2-minutes near the gateway to open sea. Together with our host family, we enjoyed walking around the crowded beach composed mostly by families. There's not much of benches to rest but anyway we're expected to be at the beach and the small restaurants/bars. It's a small village with all the amenities; potable tap water, decent restrooms, convenience stores, souvenir shops, variety of food joints, and pedestrian lanes with traffic lights. We enjoyed our meal of burger and fries but have to wait for 30 minutes for our order because of so many customers (sorry not to remember the name) chatting while sitting in a bench, and to cap our day with gelato before we ride the ferry back to the city. What a day to spend, relaxing in the company of different nationalities; indeed, a very nice world to live."

The main street itself in Manly, that leads to the sea front is more than a little touristy, with many souvenir shops, some a little tacky. The the sea front is nice, whether just for a walk by the water on the promenade or beach, or even a swim 'n surfing in the ocean itself. As for food and refreshments, there is a good choice of bars and restaurants, the less touristy ones (and both better quality and less overpriced) being in the side streets and a couple on the sea front itself. So catch a morning ferry, have a look around, take some lunch, check out the shops if you wish, swim, have a few drinks or an ice cream and then back to Sydney in the later afternoon. An enjoyable 'day out' by the sea."

Had no trouble walking around the ferry inside and out and the views were spectacular. Arrived at Manly wharf and walked across the Corso to the beach side of Manly. Stocked up with drinks and nibblies at the Woolworths shop and headed to the beach. Went to the southern part of the beach where the flags were that day. Set up camp. I saw some there with umbrellas and small shade tents. Great idea if you are spending more that a few hours on the beach. It's damn hot! The water was fresh but warm enough for the kids to spent a lot of time swimming. The Corso provided lots of eating options for lunch. There's even a pub on the corner if your thirsty. It's really is a great day out even for locals. I rate Manly particularly for families."

The Manly visitors center is immediately to the right of the ferry terminal when you disembark and they have very useful maps there. Manly itself is very easy to navigate and perfect for shopping and getting lunch, but can be very expensive. The beach itself has public restrooms and is very big and very clean with lots of surfers and swimmers. It was a very nice view and it made the perfect day trip away from Sydney!"

You can swim, surf, or just sit - either on the sand or on one of the seats on the concrete or on the grass. A picnic can also be nice. The beach is quite expansive and you can also take a walk/stroll along the sand. If you dine at one of the cafes or restaurants, a table where you have a good view of the beach is a great thing to enjoy. Many Norfolk Island pines line the whole beach and make for a lovely setting."

I also walked around and headed to the manly wildlife aquarium which is kinda small. There isn't much to see in the aquarium, but the beach is lovely and the port is bustling with food stalls. I was really tempted from the smell of the fish and chips from the many restaurants around. They just smelt lovely, just follow the crowd when you alight from the port and there is a path straight with stalls at the sides which sells a lot of food and drinks. Beware of the seagulls though cause they are a real pest. However, the beach was really awesome during summer time and there are a lot of people around surfing, swimming and just chilling by the coast. It was really windy and the sun was also really helping in creating the beach feel. So just stop by and head in there for a chilling time, either solo or with your partner."

There are so many other beaches than the beautiful main beach - Shelly Beach, Collins beach, Little Manly Cove, as well as the harbour side beaches further around the West Esplanade - Delwood and Fairlight.There are some excellent bars and restaurants. A few favourites are The Steyne, In-Situ, Manly Wharf Hotel (great on a Sunday afternoon), The Bavarian Beer Cafe for the sunsets, Hugo's, Garfish, Ouzeria for Greek food and 4 Pines for some fantastic locally crafted beer.The people are very relaxed and it has a great beachy vibe to the place. I would recommend everyone who visits Sydney to to take a day trip on the Famous Manly Ferry for a visit.Here's a little video I made of Manly to give you an idea....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGKxPBrv-0Q"

Short walk from the wharf in manly to the beach, go through the Corso.*) Excellent Views of Opera House from ferry.*) Carry a jacket, if you are sitting out, you will need it, especially in the evenings.*) Free wifi available on ferry.*) There is Max Brenner and Nandos at Manly Wharf. Hot Chocolates and Suckao at Max Brenner are very popular. White Suckao costs AUD 6.50.*) Very beautiful, and typical Australian beach with soft white Sands. Its beautiful.*) You have to cross the town via Corso to reach the actual beach.*) There were lots of restaurants nearby and an ALDI's supermarket in the wharf if you wanted food to eat along the beach.*) There is a popular Manly Scenic Walkway which I did not do.*) Take the Ferry back from Manly Wharf to Circular Quay.

The beach seems to stretch for miles of pristine sand and surf and you can choose to relax in the sun or grab a board and risk the surf!One little gem that I found was if you stand looking out to sea at the beach follow the path that follows the coast to the right. This will take you away from the crowds and to a lovely little area with a couple of caf\u00e9s and a bay which is great for snorkling. Buy some bread and feed the fish!Overall a must do trip when in Sydney :)"

You can swim, surf, paddle board. You can rent a surf board for 15 bucks an hour. Though sometimes, the rip current and the surf can be quite strong and big, so don't be surprised if no flags are raised for you to swim in between. At such times, you will hear lifeguard announcements that it is best not to swim and only surfers can go out into the water, until they can safely pitch flags for the swimmers. They are all about the public's safety so don't take it against them if they prohibit swimming for the meantime. Know that there's always a (cute) lifeguard looking out for you. In the meantime, you can enjoy walking around Manly, going to the shops, eating at their pubs, etc. This place is such a relaxed and laid back place, I love it!"

While Bondi is the iconic Sydney beach, Manly is bigger and its tree lined foreshore makes for a pleasant stroll. It also has very friendly surf lifesavers. There are scenic costal walks that can be taken from Manly. Ask tourist information about these. Check out the mural painted on the telephone exchange and also the open air shopping mall with awesome children's play equipment.

Be prepared to pay for parking if you spend more than two hours there, or if you park on the water front. The walk from Queenscliff to Shelly is really lovely and the foot paths are very wide. The surf can be a bit rough for people who are not strong swimmers, so I recommend those people to swim either at Queenscliff or Shelly Beach. Overall, I would recommend this beach to everyone."

It is a great trip and Manly is such a fabulous place to visit. Make sure you do the walk to Shelly Beach as it is well protected and a perfect location to go for a swim.

Awesome boogie boarding waves and they offer safe swim guarded areas. This beach stretches off to the left and the water is fresh and amazing. One time got stung by a blue bottle jellyfish . . . all a part of the Aussie experience. They have open showers on the beach. Get busier in the afternoon for sure. Bring your boogie board and off you go mate! Come early by Ferry as parking is expensive and hard to find!"

I would suggest you walk the Corso, walk from Manly Beach to Shelly Beach, and/or walk around Manly Cove along North Harbour toward Fairlight Pool. If you have a car, visit North Head for lovely views of the harbour and Sydney Skyline Manly is World Class. Have a swim in the calm clean harbour waters beside the ferry wharf, or swim in the fantastic surf at the patrolled parts of Manly ocean beach or the calmer waters of Shelly Beach which is also great for snorkelling. For lunch I would suggest fish and chips at the beach or walk around to the eastern side of Manly Cove and have a reasonably price beer and meal at the Manly 16 foot Skiff Club."

Much better and less busy than Bondi, plenty of decent shops, eateries and a really nice beach to soak up the sun or enjoy walks, even as you exit the wharf there is a little beach to the right which s lovely and next to a bar too as well as a worthwhile visit to Manly sea life centre, you could definetly make a couple of days out of Manly without a doubt and to catch the ferry too is great as they depart C. Quay early and depart Manly back there late so plenty of time to enjoy."

Full of attractions and exciting activities including Manly Beach, Ocean world, kayaking, swimming, tennis, golf, beach volleyball, roller blading, scenic and historical walks, art, parasailing, scuba diving, fishing, dining and so much more. Manly is the perfect destination for Sydney visitors. To reach there, I took ferry from Circular Quay. Frequency of ferry is every half an hour for going to Manly. It takes thirty minutes to reach Manly Wharf from Circular Quay. Return fare is 14.80 AUD. The scenic ferry ride through the harbour passes close to The Heads, where the sandstone cliffs at the harbour meet the ocean. It's just a 5-minute walk along the Corso from Manly Wharf to the oceanfront promenade that's lined with Norfolk Island pine trees.Manly is one of the suburbs that you will find in the northern part of Sydney. It is in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Manly is only 17 kilometers from the central business district of Sydney, so get if you want to visit Manly. This is also the administrative center of Manly Council\u2019s local government area. This is in the Northern Beaches Region.Manly is famous for its amazing beaches. The beaches in this place attract so many tourists. If you go to Manly, you will truly enjoy the sandy beaches that stretch from the Queenscliff Beach up until the North Steyne Beach to Manly Beach. In the peninsula of Manly, you will also find a lot of beaches near or on the harbour. The prominent icon that symbolizes the beaches and the ocean of Manly is the Norfolk Island Pine.The Corso is the central commercial area of Manly. This stretches from the harbour side down to the Manly Wharf until it reaches Manly Beach. There is a mall in Corso where most people go because it allows outdoor dining in the restaurants and cafes in the area. More cafes and restaurants surround the area in the neighboring streets near the place. These areas are very close to or on the beaches and harbour. It is a good place to explore Northern Sydney."

When we left Sydney Harbour the sun had been shining and it was very warm, at Manly it became overcast, misty with a much cooler feel as the breeze picked up. This did impact on our enjoyment of Manly, the breeze is something to be aware of if coming for a day trip, you may need a top with sleeves as it becomes cooler and if the sun is shining loads of sun screen. I was expecting Manly to be nicer than Bondi from the info I'd read, but both my partner and I can honestly say we preferred Bondi much more."

We took the Manly Ferry from Circular Quay (AUD$14.80 adult return) which was a good experience in itself - with picturesque views of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, the Sydney Harbour area (including The Heads) and of Manly suburb. Although there are small strips of sand either side of the wharf, once docked, head straight over the road onto The Corso which is a pedestrianised shopping precinct with opportunities to pick up a souvenir. This leads to the main Manly Beach area which stretches for some distance.It\u2019s mainstream, with a promenade and shoreline bordered with properties - some residential, some commercial. The bulk of the eating places appear to be at The Corso area of the promenade although we found a decent enough little caf\u00e9 to have pizza for lunch further along North Steyne (left as you face the beach). The beach is golden sand, very spacious and attracts loads of surfers. We only paddled in at the edge of the water to cool our toes!The place wasn\u2019t overly busy and I preferred it to Bondi Beach which is similar but appeared a bit more commercial.As others on TA mention, well worth a short trip if you\u2019ve got a few hours to spare combining the scenic boat trip with a attractive beach location."

Before you head to the main beach......Explore the area where the ferry drops you off. There are some nice places for fish and chips over looking the harbour. The beach on this side is also relatively quiet. Where the beach is on the ferry terminal side take a walk to the Sealife Centre, then keep walking past the Sealife Centre, along a path, up some stairs, and you'll have an amazing view from the top of the stairs. We sat at the top for ages just admiring the view. It's only a few steps, easy for all ages.For the main beach, you get off the ferry, and it's a very short walk down the main shopping street. The beach is very nice, and clean, and great for surfing, but it was also very busy as it was a public holiday. After half an hour we headed back to the beach near the ferry terminal as it was very quiet.Plenty of shopping opportunities, and places to eat. We very easily spent the whole day here relaxing. It feels a million miles away from the centre of Sydney when you're relaxing here but it's only a short ferry ride away.Well worth a visit"

Nice beach to take a walk on. There are lifeguards at the beach who constanty monitor and move the signs/pennants so that you know exactly what part of the beach is safe to swim in. This is also a great place to eat your lunch although the seagulls can be quite loud and aggressive. There are many shops/restaurants/ice cream lining the walk to the beach.

Firstly you have the pleasure of a ferry trip to Manly that lasts about 15-20 mins that takes you straight past the opera house and harbour bridge giving you perfect views and great opportunity for photos.Manly is like a seaside town as there are loads of shops, bars and restaurants to visit. The beach is very long and had some great waves. Manly was busy so not for anyone who does not enjoy busy beaches but I really enjoyed it. Overall i preferred Manly beach to Bondi.There is a little hidden jem beach at Manly if you head to the right of the beach. By taking a 10 minutes walk it takes you to a smaller beach that is quiter and will gives you great views of Manly beach, well worth the walk."

The ferry departuring from Circular Quay going to Manly allows you to take a great view of Sydney.

It seems by my observation that Bondi Beach is more trendy and for the must be seen types while I feel Manly is more laid back and down to earth with surfers and families alike. It has great surf (and the surf gets more challenging on beaches going north- Dee Why and Collaroy) but it also has a nice sheltered cove on the south end called Shelley beach with a great walking path and dragon lizard spotting in between. You can walk from the ferry terminal to the beach on the Corso where there are plenty of shops/cafes/grocer to get your beach needs or just shop as a tourist. Great restaurants and bars to wrap up the day. A little of something for everyone."

We chose an outside seat since it was a beautiful day and we were rewarded with beautiful views of Sydney and surrounds as we travelled smoothly to the ferry dock at Manley. Once there, we stopped into the tourist info, where a friendly Sheila directed us to the beach and asked us if we had our \"cossies\" with us. We walked through the little town, crossing the tiny peninsula to the beach and spent a very enjoyable time swimming, sunning and taking in the view. I would recommend taking the stroll further on to Shelly Beach, where there is good snorkeling and more gentle waves. The waves at Manly were great for swimming, although the water cleared out quickly when an announcement was made about the blue bottle jellyfish washing in with the onshore breeze. After swimming, enjoy a Ben and Jerry's ice cream across from the beach before you rinse off the sand and head to the ferry back to Sydney."

Manly Beach is accessible by ferry, car or bus, with metered parking or paid parking in the council carpark if travelling by car. Be warned though parking can be hard to find in busy periods."

It was well worth the visit. From the ferry ride there, that offered amzing views of Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbout Bridge etc. To the short walk from the Manly ferry terminal to the beach, through the nice collection of shops and eateries. To the very beautiful long beach itself. There was so much happening on the beach, but it still wasn't crowded at all. It was so relaxing after looking around the shops, to just sit and relax on the beach and watch things like the 'Learn To Surf' class that was on. The atmosphere at Manly beach simply felt great. With a short ferry ride to Sydney city, I would love to live in Manly!"

It's a long stretch of beach with great surf (my mum even saw Layne Beachley getting out of the water!), rock pools and plenty of accessible cafes. The atmosphere is relaxed and the ferry ride over is enjoyable. Do it as a day-trip, or get some accommodation and chill-out there for a few days."

I visited Manly beach on my recent trip to Oz and have to say the experience left me cold and not wanting to return.The problem with it are the flocks of seagulls that stalk it. You may ask how seagulls can ruin a trip there, but believe me they did not only for me but for everyone I talked to who were trying to eat their lunch on it.Basically if you are eating a roll or a sandwich or basicaly anything, you get dive bombed by utterly brazen seagulls who literally snatch the food out of your hands.My salad roll was taken and in the process my arm badly scratched. The lady next to me's daughter was left traumatized when a seagull dive bombed her and tried to snatch her sandwich, only to miss and scratch her face badly.And if you make the mistake of throwing a seagull any food at all it is then joined by dozens of others who rip the food to pieces and go berserk with each other over who gets a mouthfull.I visisted many beaches in Australia and Manly was the only one with this problem. So my advice is avoid it if you have small children or if you intend to eat your lunch there."

En-route you see these small islands as well as young and old riding their boats over a sunny weekend. The final approach is a bit deceptive as you'll see this tiny beach. But the actual Manly beach is a 5 mins walk inside through some bustling shops & restaurants.The beach is a loooooong one. Clean enough and you can find a quiet enough spot if you walk further down on the left from the entrance. Hubby and I had a lovely 2 hour nap on the beach then took an unplanned but well worth it de-tour towards Shelly beach. We did the nature walk from Shelly beach back to Manly which was an experience in itself. Beautiful! Be careful to have your GPS working as you may get lost during this trail. We ended the day at one of the restaurants at Manly wharf before we headed back around 10 p.m. Great thing is Ferries operate till past midnight so you don't have to rush back. Over all a great day and will visit again!"

Unique visual aspects in that it was the only beach we saw that had a wind-break of large, rich green pine trees lining the beach walk. The beach front cafe's are a bit more affordable than some of the other beaches, and - from this reviewers perspective - the surfing looked better than Bondi on the day we were there. A very busy surfing class and a half-dozen beach volley ball games were in progress. More like a San Diego beach than an LA beach."

If you are visiting Sydney, now voted the number two destination behind London to visit - take the Manly Ferry across Sydney Harbor to Manly. Firstly, I must say that I have a legitimate bias towards Many Beach! I grew up there and visit my mother there each year. I cannot wait to get on my walking shoes and head around Manly Beach to Shelley Beach, a protected marine reserve, for my morning walk. You can walk right around the point and look down over the Pacific and crashing waves below. Good breakfast and coffee to be had at the Bower cafe or for dinner Le Kiosk, a 5 star restaurant with and 5 star prices for that special occasion. The mornings for me are the best and usually the sun is just coming up over the ocean, the board riders are sitting off shore waiting for waves, the mothers with strollers are jogging along the promenade, people having their morning coffee together on the benches facing the ocean, the seniors having their morning swim winter and summer and the Manly life guards teaching children to board ride and many walking their dogs. The ocean is warm, seductive and safe. Always bathe between the flags! You can also walk north to Queenscliff along the beach. Craft markets on the weekends too offering all kinds of unusual gifts. Great eats everywhere to spend the day. Enjoy your visit!"

Although the beach is usually crowded and the surfers are plentiful it is still possible to have a swim and enjoy the scenery from the sand.

The beach is beautifully clean, and we had a great afternoon watching the surfers and enjoying the atmosphere. Once we lost the sun, we crossed the road to the bar, then caught the ferry back to the City. We were recommended Manly over Bondi - haven't been to Bondi for some years to compare, but we were very happy with our choice. If that is how Sydney residents spend their winter afternoons, no wonder so many Brits want to move there! What a great lifestyle!"

On the day we visited, Redfoo was filming a music video, so bonus entertainment was provided at no extra cost! Our daughter loved it... The beach itself was clean, and although a little busy, it didn't feel overcrowded. The atmosphere was relaxed and casual, with locals and tourists sharing the space.

It's a wonderful view. There are plenty of places to sit and stare, and relax. It's great to sit and unwind with the Norfolk Pines behind, filled with chattering birds. There are many food outlets in the Corso, the main strip running between the Ocean Beach and the Harbour Beach, and loads of places to buy coffee or icecreams. From the beach there is a stroll around the headland to Shelly Beach, which is the subject of another review. Sometimes there are too many tourists (like me?), too many children running around, too many teenagers doing what teenagers do, but nothing beats Manly Beach."

Restaurants, a long boardwalk with shopping, a photographic beach at one end and the Manly Ferry whatf at the other. The only attraction I would avoid is the Manly Aquarium which, last year, was a tired unattractive building. This year I kept close to the Boardwalk and enjoyed eating an icecream on the beach. Plan your visit to Manly when the sun is shining because there won't be many people on the beach if it is raining."

Took a ferry from Circular Quay over to Manly, had lunch and then walked down the length of the beach and just watched people. The weather was good so there were lots of people on the beach, playing volleyball, surfing, etc. There are water fountains at intervals along the whole stretch which is useful when you get thirsty. A good number of benches as well, if you feel like taking a break."

            "review": "Fantastic beach!. My family in Australia had mentioned that this is the best beach in Sydney and they were not wrong.One can easily access the beach from Circular Quay by taking the ferry. The ferry leaves every 30 minutes, so if you miss one, you can always catch the next one. Be ware that the ferry gates closes 5 - 10 minutes before the ferry actually leaves so you should be inside the ferry terminal in advance by 5 - 10 minutes.I think by far the cheapest way to visit Manly, if you also need to go around Sydney for the day and take Sydney's buses and train system, is to purchase a day pass. The day pass cost 22 auz dollars, but it would save you money in the end as a return trip to Manly cost approximately 15 dollars already.When you arrive at Manly Wharf, there is a straight road from the Wharf all the way to the beach at the end of the road. It is walkable and you do not need to take further public transport. The road is lined with many shops, from grocery stores, eateries to Billabongs and souvenir shops.The area is slightly overpriced, but this is once again a tourist area, so you should spend wisely if you are thinking of purchasing something from Manly.Also not far from the beach are hostels. They are definitely a great idea if you are in Sydney for a chilled holiday and all you want to do is lay on the beach or surf. As mentioned however, if you do decide to stay in Manly, you will be far away from Sydney (15 dollar ferry ride return) so it will be difficult for you to see the attraction in Sydney itself and there is not much to do in Manly besides the beach.The beaches of Manly are fantastic though. They are not crowded, and the beachfront is lined with pine trees, which give great shade under a hot summer sun. You will see plenty of people in the water surfing and kids building sandcastles on the beach. There are also tourists there, especially taking the \"jump up when the wave comes in\" photos. The beach is quiet and perfect for a relaxing time. Best of all, it is free to go on the beach, one of the gems of Sydney one must visit."

I had a few hours one Sunday morning before my flight back home.A slightly grey day in the City, but a complete transformation when I arrived at Manly Beach. I hired a car as it's the most flexible way to get about at your own pace, and after negotiating the traffic jams through Mosman (both ways) which I hear are the norm, I arrived at the beach in what seemed to be mid-summer. The beach front was packed, the restaurants were packed, the surfers were to be seen in force arriving on their bicycles, runners, skaters, families, swimmers, all it seems, determined to hang out on the beach for the day.All the parking was full, so not a very car friendly area which is OK with the amount of people wandering around and crossing the road between cafes and beach, plus the ever watchful police who pounce on you if you do happen to stop for a look.I was looking for somewhere quiet to gaze out over the ocean, so I kept on going to the next bay as this was just too busy for me.It looks like there is a shopping area as well if you don't find enough going on at the beach.Everything looked very clean and the public toilets were well maintained even with all the beach-folk."

The Beach offers public conveniences, also has a rock pool and has a plathora of shops and dining (a la carte or cafe) experiences and places to just sit and enjoy the ocean view along the way. The beach is a safe place to swim as it has a proactive lifeguard unit who help and advise visitors when needed. For overseas visitors it is a must to take heed of the warming flags in order for you to swim safely and keep enjoying the day at Manly beach. You can take the public Manly ferry from Sydney (Circular Quary) or a public bus and or drive. The walk between Manly and Fairy Bowers is also a lovely leisurely walk and on weekends especially you will see most families take advantage of this walk beach to beach. On weekend, you will often find market stalls to add more to the lovely cultural village effect. Definitely worth a visit to Manly beach, a great day's outing."

We saw a beautiful beach/gold sands/sunset in 1 shot. We didn't plan to swim, cause it's winter time. We only stood in front of the beach to enjoy the view and walked to look around Manly.Manly has St. Matthews Church, many shops, cafe / restaurant, convenience store, etc. Before got ferry back to Circular Quay we stopped by at Aldi to buy some packs of chocolate & biscuits. We took nice pictures of Sydney Opera & city at nights before ferry approached to Circular Quay. We think Manly beach is better than Bondi."

They were right on! It was a gorgeous late fall day. Very warm with kids on a school holiday. Enjoyed watching surfing schools for little kids and wished we had had our grand kids with us. We really did think we were back in the states walking along Hermossa Beach. Very laid back like southern California and the beach was beautiful. Walked from one end to the other which is a hike but worked up an appetite for a wonderful seafood lunch at a local restaurant, Le Kiosk, looking out at the water on Shelley Beach. Spent a couple of hours walking the town. Very touristy. Good place to by gifts for kids at home. Found Aboriginal Dreamtime Fine Art Gallery at 36 the corso with lovely Aboriginal Art for sale. Could not convince my husband we needed to add this art work to our home but I thought she had the best selection we had seen. Understanding the history of each painting and the artist creating it is worth spending time in these galleries. Loved getting my feet wet in the Manly Bay and soaking up the sun. If we had not had ballet tickets at the Opera House that evening, we would have stayed, rented bicycles and enjoyed a sunset dinner. If we were ever to return to Sydney, I would plan a few days staying at one of the small boutique hotels advertised in Manly literature."

So, you have toured the city centre of Sydney, made good use of the decent metro system, and happily snapped away at the Harbour Bridge. Or, you may have just arrived early morning from a long haul flight, and need to \u00e7lear the cobwebs away'.Take the Manly ferry from Circular Quay, and if possible, sit outside on deck for the lovely journey across the Harbour to Manly. It has some very nice 1930s apartments and buildings, a beautiful beach, where you can watch those who perhaps before being brave enough to surf at Bondi, come here to practice, and there is a wide choice of places to have lunch or coffee. Certainly, a trip to Manly should be part of a visit to Sydney, but it is also a very civilized way to spend part of your day in this amazing city. Now, where did I put that real estates phone number?!"

There are maps everywhere directing you how to get around Manly.If you forgot sunscreen, there are many \"Discount Shops\" that will sell it from $10 (100ml tube) to $12 (200ml tube).After 3PM (when I went) the trees shade the beach a little too much cooling it down (-1 star). The waves are unpredictable as well. The first day I went they were 4-6 feet. The second time I went, they were less than a foot.Overall I would recommend this as one of the things to do in Sydney."

We played with our 3 and 6 year old kids on the beach all day and they thoroughly enjoyed being in and out of the sea in the safe swimming area. It's the furthest I've ever been in the sea (wet hair!!) and smiled all day. Do not (unlike the fool we watched have to be rescued) ignore the flags!The beach was clean and the loos were fine.

I thought this was one of the best bargins I had on my holiday, I was advised to use the ferry by a chap I got talking to on the 'Hop on - hop off' bus, which is another good value attraction."

            "review": "What a great place to spend a Saturday afternoon or any afternoon.. I think this is my favourite beach in all of Sydney. What a place to spend a Saturday afternoon or indeed any afternoon for that matter. In my view, if you only have a few days in Sydney then a visit to Manly via one of the large ferries - Narrabeen, Collaroy, Freshwater or Queenscliff (they are named after some of the Northern beaches) is a must. They take up to 1100 passengers and if you are observant you can see the counters at Circular Quay/Manly which show the number of spaces left on each ferry. It can be a bit 'choppy' when you come to the Gap (open sea to your right) going to Manly but that only lasts for a few minutes.There are lovely walks both to the left and right when you come to the seafront at Manly via the corso (pedestrian mall with all the shops) from the ferry terminal. The beach is perhaps predictably busy around here but usually I head to the left and if you are lucky you may be rewarded by being able to watch a game of beach volleyball - quite mesmerising and very watchable in some respects! It is a very relaxing and undemanding walk to North Steyne beach and then Queenscliff with the 'trademark' Norfolk pines to the left. If you are energetic you could even walk to Freshwater beach and keep on going to beach after beach heading north!Doubling back and going past the corso, the very small Shelly beach is well worth a visit - again a nice walk round there and from here you can see the Northern beaches away in the distance. In my opinion, Manly is a very well presented and maintained set of beaches and promenade walks, mainly devoid of the backpacker brigade which is a definite plus. Plenty of 'bathroom' facilities and seats available. A classy area and even the dogs are nice breeds and well behaved - seriously.At weekends, the crafts market is defintely worth a visit - nice locally produced goods and if you are there mid to end of January then Humphreys newsagents in the corso really reduces the prices of the Northern beaches calendars which generally you can't get in Sydney itself- great value.In summary, Manly is a must visit."

You alight from the ferry at Manly Wharf in Manly Cove, and ignoring the pretty nice scenery already surrounding you, cross the street into the pedestrianised street called The Corso. Walk along here (about 400 metres I'd estimate) and you then emerge onto South Steyne. The other side of this road is a grassy and tree-lined esplanade beyond which is Manly Beach. Strictly speaking this runs south (to your right) but becomes North Steyne Beach and then Queenscliff Beach to the north (your left). As far as the visitor is concerned you can regard this all as one, and magnificent it is too with beautiful light yellow sand and warm Pacific water. There are various sections given over to different pursuits such as volleyball and the obligatory surfing and this separation is well enforced. We were there on a sunny Sunday, but even though busy it was nothing like the zoo that European beaches can be. The road is lined with eateries of varying kinds as well as other shops and indeed The Corso is much the same. If you want to picnic or get a take-out there are benches and tables available on the grassed area. Do the walk along to Shelly Beach (very easy,1 km max) and look out for the water dragons en route. Be as active or sedentary as you wish, this is just a fantastic place - a Sydney must-do."

We asked enough questions of our tour guide (who was leaving us after a week package tour), as well as our hotel concierge. Once armed with enough information, we bought all-day transit passes, walked from our downtown hotel, took a bus to Circular Quay in Sydney Harbour, then took the next ferry out to Manly Beach, after a nice ~30 minute scenic boat ride. We knew enough to walk straight ahead, thru the street of souvenir, food and surf shops, to Manly Beach, on the other side of the shopping walkway. The beach was crowded, since it was a warm weekend, we enjoyed walking around the beach, and had a good time. When we had seen enough, we walked back to the Ferry and returned to Sydney. It was a fun side trip, easy enough to do (for those like us that were tourists, visitors), and without a car or our own transportation (relied on all public transit). It was a fun visit and glad that we got to see Manly Beach."

Manyly itself is a charming seaside town with lots of eateries and you can fill up your drinking water bottle from taps in the street. The beach is clean and has huge breakers with floury white sand. To my mind this is easier to get to and more enjoyable than Bondi!"

We reached there by taking the easy ride on the Sydney Ferry that leaves Circular Quay and arrives at Manly about 1/2 hour later. That was fun, plain and simple.I rate this beach as number two in the area as I have a yen for Bondi Beach first. But Manly Beach is still worth a visit or two. The beach is pretty good. Like all surf beaches, you have to be safe and swim only when told it is safe and always stay between the flags. It saves lives and seems simple enough even when there and in the water.One big thing that Manly Beach has going for it is The Corso shopping area. On The Corso, one can find lots of good souvenirs in all price ranges, and also lots of places to eat at. It is well worth the visit and it just would not feel like being at Sydney if we had not gone at least once. There is more beach life to see than just Bondi and Manly is very good in its own right.My wife is disabled and finds it hard and painful to walk. For those reasons, we took none of the local walks in. I wish we could have, but it was out of the question for us."

At nights take a drink at the North Steyne Hotel or the Old Boatshed if you're after some live music. The Four Pines Brewery will also serve you some home-brewed pale ale, lager or cider."

Many come here from the city suburbs just to get away from it all anyway, so we just walked up and down The Corso (main street) and looked at the souvenir shops, checked out the eateries, enjoyed the architecture, and hung out between showers. One side of Manly is the sea with a decent surf coming in and quite spectacular. The harbourside is more protected, but it was still relatively rough. The shark netted area for swimming isn't very large and I imagine it would be crowded on a good day. But this is a city beach, so don't expect pristine white sand with acres of privacy. We enjoyed the visit and would probably come back on the sunny day for a swim and relax - hopefully not too crowded, but i think it would be. We took a car over from the city, but that was because we had another destination to go to, but otherwise the ferry ride is cheap and relaxing, so definitely go that way."

I took a ferry from Sydney Harbour and had an excellent experience while on the ferry and even more enchanting one when there at Manly Beach. One can get a day pass for $22 to travel, unlimited, on ferries, trains and buses in 24 hours. I being a student got it for only $11. Its worth more than that. The ferry ride is twenty minutes one way from Sydney Harbour to Manly Beach. You travel in clear blue waters,seeing the Sydney skyline, Harbour Bridge and Opera house from vantage points. Once you reach Manly Beach it has its own enchanting landscape. For me the word is \"enchanting\" when i think of Manly Beach. Translucent sea green water at the edges, merging into vivid blues beyond, bordered by small cliffs is my idea of enchanting. There is Museum of Contemporary Art for those who are interested in Arts/museums. A choice of restaurants and fast food is available too. Once there, walk around to explore the area, particularly climb the cliff beyond the Museum, approachable through stairs as well and then climb down to the beach from different places, each place offering a different \"enchanting\" view.Strongly recommended, a must visit when in Sydney"

You arrive at a small beach and can walk to the end of one of the streets to a large beach where there are lots of surfers. Plenty of shops and outdoor cafes.It was a little too breezy near that surfing beach to dine at an outdoor cafe, so we found a spot closer to where the ferry dropped us off. On a Thursday evening, it was filled with locals having a wonderful time. There are various food options and you just grab a spot at a table and order food from a counter.

Where you get off the ferry there is a fairly small, but beautiful beach, with clear, still water and a netted off area where it is safe to swim. There are boats all around, and I am told that sometimes the water can be oily, but when we were there it was crystal clear! On the other side of Manley, a 5 minute walk from the ferry, is the main beach, which is very long, with choppy, wavy sea perfect for surfing. Towards the far end of the beach it is calmer and that seems to be where most of the swimmers go. When we were there, they had shark signs up, and the alarms were going off so they got everyone out of the water, but none of the surfers seemed to bother, and it only seemed to affect one end of the beach. There was a lifeguard on a jet ski following the shark and trying to scare it off, and a helicopter flew over looking for it which was quite exciting!! But needless to say we chose to swim at the other netted beach where the water was calm! There are loads of shops selling refreshments and suncream/beach wear etc... so you will be well catered for. There are also fountains with drinking water, it doesn't taste great, but is perfectly drinkable if you are on a budget. I would definitly go to Manley again!"

Only problem with Australian Tourism is the high cost of food and travel and accommodation - hear this from lots of travellers."

I have always loved Sydney, its harbor, the zoo by ferry, the Royal Botanic Gardens, the opera house--all in walking distance of the parking garage! After this third trip, I think it may be the most beautiful city in the world. I reluctantly rate the harbor more attractive than my own magnificent Chicago lakefront. If you count the folks gathered on a Sunday, the harbor wins out hands down. On this trip, I finally made it to Manly. Wow. An upscale wonder beach with bright sun, tons of sun worshippers and in spite of the crowds, spotlessly clean with big rolling waves reminiscent of the South Jersey shore. The ride over on the ferry was no less a delight as we passed through more than 100 sail boats, many in full race along the sparkling waves. Even a regatta of retired America's cup size racers out for a spint and loaded with water loving Sydneyites and tourists.A week's worth of fun and delight with the days at Manly well worth the trip."

It can get a little crowded, but out of Bondi, Coogee and Manly, I feel Manly is the best of the 3. Don't forget to try local fish n chips as well! The only downside when I was there is that the wind was coming in off the water and bringing in small, stinging (non-lethal) jelly-fish called \"blue bottles.\" You had to go in the water at your own risk for this reason."

Should plan to go there in the morning. either go for a beach walk or enjoy the beach is fine. Make sure to buy Fish and Chip or other cooked seafood from\" Manly Ocean Foods\" for picnic on the beach. It is the best. A bit long queue but worths waiting. If you come withe the family, plan to go over the weekend, then buy \" Family Fun Day Tickets\". Which cost only AU$2.50 each. This helps a lot of saving both train and furry or any combine modes of transportation."

A short stroll along a pedestrianised shopping street to Manly beach. Very crowded but plenty of room still available. My only quibble is that there are no large sun shades to rent. Not good if you cannot sunbathe.The lifeguards were very busy and eventually closed two sections as they were becoming dangerous for swimmers. So well organised.Lunch at a local Bar was ok and we walked and then returned to the City."

Manly is so relaxed, great shops and do go and dine at The Manly Winery - great wine and food. The beach is clean and chance to sit back and watch the surfers. Make sure you bring your suncream - the rays are seriously dangerous and you will burn without it."

Didnt like the type of people in Bondi either. manly on the otherhand had a friendly family feel to it. The beach itself is very clean, apparently was dirty back in the 80s. Lots of greenery around and some neat little cafes. I highly reccommend you take the Ferry from Circular Quay. What a journey that is, the only way to get there. Makes for a great day out!"

Close to the manly ferry and lots of great shops including Fish and Chips that you can eat whilst looking out at the ocean. The only downside were the changerooms at the beach, They were clean but I think they need to be a bit bigger, the shower rose was fixed and, if you had your clothes in the change section of the cubicle you'd end up with wet clothes. Apart from that we enjoyed our trip :)"

You'd have to travel by ferry from Circular Quay or if you go by car , through the underwater tunnel. But having seen all the beaches above, for me Manly is the nicest one in terms of neatness, cleanliness and surrounding areas. Toilet is quite near , and quite clean. Restaurants are also only across the street. Lovely tall trees alongside the beach with benches to sit. There's small fountains coming out of the floor in the promenade where the restaurants are. Kids love playing with it. Only thing I would recommend is that to be more careful in picking a restaurant to eat. We ate at the restaurant called \"WATERVUE\" right on the promenade across the beach. Food was so bad, the steak was so tough and thin, the fish and chips looks factory made (all the exact shape and size) and worst of all the manager is disrespectful and rude (only because we ask to open the umbrella where we sit). Probably because its a tourist area, they don't really care to give good service, since most people will only come once (especially foreign tourists). better to just eat at hungry jacks or other restaurant.And it turns out I wasn't the only one with bad experience there , a lot of reviewers on tripadvisor have the same experience.In conclusion if you have only short amount of time to spend in Sydney and you can't go to all the beaches there, Manly is the one to go to."

However, Manly is backed by civilization, manned by stalwart-looking lifeguards, and surrounded by a very well planned boardwalk. That and it has an excellent surf when the wind from Peru arrives. It's easily reachable from the ferry so even I had no excuse for avoiding it. Thankfully, I did not. The dislikable sand is fine, there were few rocks further out the no-swim areas (due to cross currents) were well marked. It is also a family beach, which I prefer, meaning that all ages were present when we attended, lending a casual ambiance to things. Highly recommended -- especially because you'll enjoy the ferry ride as well."

Shops along the Corso (pedestrian mall) include surf wear shops like Quicksilver, Billabong, Roxy and others. There is also a small playground suitable for younger kids in the middle of the corso and another not far along the beachfront. Lots of different cafes, restaurants and bars from the wharf, throughout the Corso and along the beachfront. Not to mention all the ice-cream shops! Beach is nice and not too crowded. Also lots of walking paths (or hire bikes!) By chance we happened to go when the Manly Jazz Festival was on which was great - lots of free jazz music plus markets and kids activities (for a fee) along the beachfront which made for an awesome atmosphere (though very busy!) Ferry trip also offers many great photo opportunities of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, Kirrabilly and Sydney city view. Highly recommend this as a day trip!"

Although it was a little cold and windy when I went the beach was beautiful and there were still tons of surfers out in the water. The beach is lined with various different shops and restaurants and is a great place to spend the day. The ferry ride from Circular Quay takes exactly 30 minutes and is a pleasant ride through the Harbor. I would highly recommend this day trip to anyone. You can even go for a few hours."

The order was waiting with 6 or so others going cold. Our order for poached eggs came fried, mine were luckily ok and so we waited even longer for another order of eggs. We were not alone in our wait as others were asking and even leaving. Maybe if we were told there was a wait we would have been able to understand the delay. Only 1 of 2 dishes were satisfactory."

The lifeguards on this beach are very dutiful and keep a watchful eye on everyone in the water. There are two flags staked in the sand and all swimmers must stay between the two flags, and the lifeguards will remind those who stray outside of the flags with their loud megaphones. They have good reason though; there are some strong riptides and the flagged area is chosen because it's the safest portion of the water to be in. That being said, the waves are high and a lot of fun to jump over! The water is cold but it feels great on a hot summer day. The beach is really popular and is packed during the summer. There are a lot of great places to shop and eat; the fish and chips here is particularly spectacular. There's one fish and chip shop that's very close to the beach on the main strip that has a HUGE line, and for good reason! I can't remember the name of it but it's a small place with a good selection of fresh fish. I developed my fondness for Barramundi here.While you're here, definitely take a stroll down the Manly Scenic Walkway to Shelly Beach. Even better, get a cone from Copenhagen to enjoy during your walk.l"

It's called Cabbage Tree Bay and is an absolute gem with a small kiosk and restaurant there as well. Quieter, peaceful, scenic as hell.

Starting with the scenic ferry ride over from Circular Quay and ending with the ride back again, it can be quite an experience. Not only can you sunbathe on the beach and swim in the ocean, but also partake in the activities that always seem to be on at Manly. There is an abundance of shops, from Sportsgirl to unique one-off stores, Manly a great place to do a bit of shopping. There are also many good restaurants, cafes, ice cream shops etc. Whatever the cuisine you are after you will most likely find it here. Make sure you also check out neighbouring Cabbage Tree Bay aquatic reserve. Follow the path to the right when facing Manly beach. It takes you past the Fairy Bower Pools and leads to a small beautiful beach (Shelly Beach), popular with learning scuba divers. Have a look around the area, walk up the hill to get some amazing views and maybe spot the odd water dragon lizard in the bushes."

Manly beach can easily reached by an half hour ferry ride from Circular quay (ferries leave from wharf 3) .It is a clean and well kept, and very popular with surfers. The beach has volleyball nets too. My tip would be to head to either far end when it is busy - people seem to congregate in the middle so it is more crowded there. You can also walk round to Shelly beach, which is sheltered from the waves and a popular diving and snorkelling spot, with a cafe and restaurant right next to it."

The local shops and restaurants were as touristy as can be imagined. Think Ft. Walton Beach or Myrtle Beach. The beach itself is perfectly fine. Once you get off the main walkways, there are some nice neighborhoods, but it takes some exploring to find the gems here. Do more research and find the quieter, out-of-the way places with more character than Manly."

There are bars and restaurants here but make sure you walk through the Corso to the main beach. We love to walk south to Shelley beach- there is a good vantage point from the headland, or north to Queenscliff beach. The area is fairly flat, sothe walk is not strenuous at all. Have a swim if the weather permits. Enjoy a snack and coffee of even a glass of wine or two overlooking the beach. The are plenty of cafes and restaurants to choose from. A \"must do\" day out for every visitor to Sydney."

There was even a sign warning about sewage in the sea when he tide is high (which didn't exactly tempt me to go for a dip).As others have said, the concessions are quite a walk from the beach itself and we did find a nice cafe for some fish 'n' chips which was pretty much the highlight of our trip.If i'm fortunate enough to visit sydney again, i'll be giving this place a miss."

We took the ferry from Sydney (included in our transport pass but can be bought separately for about 7 dollars I think) and stayed for the afternoon. The main street is Il Corso and it has your typical tourist souvenir shops and restaurants. Our guide book said to avoid buying food on this street since it was usually mediocre and expensive. So we managed to find a bakery on the adjacent street (31 Sydney Road) that sold a lot of appetizing things (sandwiches, pizza, etc) for not too much. We found a nearby bench and had a nice lunch in the shade. We then made our way toward Shelly beach, very close by. Overall, a very pretty location. Water was warm and the sun was beaming.

If you\u2019re thinking of volunteering, (i.e. helping out through marketing & website, finance & ordering, cleaning, stock taking, working in the shop, literally anything you can think of.) try and test yourself to get past the trouble outweighing the advantages of volunteering and careful not to over commit your time, energy and resources.For me, no amount of spirulina (I currently dislike equally along with coriander) will stop me visiting a local food co-op.OPEN Tuesday \u2013 Sunday 10am-3pm Closed Monday21B Whistler Street, MANLYwww.manlyfoodcoop.org"

Then it's a short walk (4 mins) to one of the best surf beaches you could hope for so close to town (bondi and cogee are great too). You can travel the world looking for great beaches and some are like heaven....but never this clean whilst only a hop skip and jump from a major city. And warm enough to swim in the middle of autumn.!! Clearly I love it and so did my daughter. We went for a fun school holiday away from Melbourne where the water is warmer."

Many surf stores and many restaurants. Very casual atmosphere and lovely coastal views all around. Better atmosphere than Bondi Beach. Well worth it to spend a day here and go to Shelly Beach for lunch or a drink which is just on the other side of the peninsula, if you have the time. Shelly is a very sheltered quiet beach if you don't come on a weekend. The restaurant, which is on the beach, is very popular so try not to come on a weekend."

Awesome.C) head straight right (East) for fabulous restaurant, or go to B) then head south on the boardwalk to a beautiful inlet for truly scenic delight, bodysurfing and cafe. Bill Bryson details his visit here in his book about Australia. Its not that scary! You might also see the Tony Abbott ( the opposition leader) there in his red speedos!"

The lifeguards are well organised and are patched into the sound system along the beach to ensure people do not forget how strong the rip tide can be on the majority of Austalia's Pacific facing beaches. This was a great experience and a beach I would revisit again and again. If you want to sit and watch the the world go by, there are plenty of restaurants along the promenade and Los of water fountains and sheltered seating and trees along the promenade if you want to escape the sun for a while. I can see why this place is popular with visitors and people from Syndney. I would definitely visit again and again, in fact I will consider staying in Manley on my next visit to Sydney."

Take your pick from the many shop owners, but be sure to visit the ones with the biggest queues as it is worth it. The fish is sooo fresh.The reason it gets a very good rating instead of 5 stars is Manly really is for those who like the water - there isn't much else around except for that and pubs where we went. The main thoroughfare has shops (mainly food places) but it is besieged with seagulls so isn't a comfortable spot to rest up and eat! The ferry is the stock standard commuter ferry which we found cheap and a really nice trip. There is plenty of opportunity for great photos on the way to Manly and this is just as good as taking one of the cruise vessels."

The close proximity of the shopping mall, the Steyne Bar for a refreshment or meal, but the overall view, the fresh salty sea water, and the variety of people enjoying the warmth of a summers day at the beach, all supports a visit to Manly Beach."

Manly Beach is pleasant and very good for surfing. You can also rent a bike there, go rollerskating or enjoy a barbecie or a meal at one of its many restaurants. Really worth visiting."

Either stroll to the beach from your accommodation in Manly or from one of the most pcituresque and enjoyable ferry trips in the world originating from Circular Quay. The beach is terrific and the waves are loads of fun. If you want more calm waters, walk south along Manly Beach to the shore path to Shelly Beach. Manly Beach is also the start of a great 1.5-2 h walk to the North Head. The walk includes great views of the Pacific, bush track, a war memorial area closer to the Head and that glorious view from the North Head itself. The return to Manly Beach via Manly cove and the corso is a pleasant way to end."

Manly beach is a beautiful beach lined with nice restaurants and bars, i suggest rather than staying in sydney you rent an apartment in manly its the perfect spot for beach lovers with a great shopping district, all your aussie brand names line that beach, its also a great spot to learn how to surf. Theres a surf school on the beach with very friendly instructors, its the safest beach i went to in the sydney area, with lifeguards during the day beach volleyball and beautiful walking paths that line the coast. If your not a beach lover the shopping district is beautiful all your brand name stores, ice cream shops serving the very best and freshest ice creams. The manly ferry can take you anywhere you need to go in Sydney and the ferry system is much faster than driving, if you enjoy skiing and snowboarding the blue mountains are 45 minutes outside of sydney where u can enjoy hitting the slopes in a t-shirt and shorts. Manly is the ultimate destination in Sydney i prefered its beach over all the famous beaches including bondi beach. Also for the party in you just off the manly ferry are some tremendous outdoor bars and clubs take in the sights with a good drink overlooking the beautiful harbours of Sydney, guaranteed you wont regret a moment, and you'll never want to leave."

Otherwise, take the trip over on the ferry to enjoy for a day!There was a massive skate bowl shipped in from the USA on the beach with a national competition.The surfing event featured Occy, Parko, Taj etcMusic was a large stage on the beach with The Living End and Sneaky Sound System.All FREE and insane!

Early morning joggers and surfers were heading out for their pre-work day exercise. As Canucks leaving our winter behind, we were envious of them. We picked up our pace. Along the way, we were awestruck by the beauty of about 20 large Cockatoos under the shade of the trees. People walked by like it was nothing.

But the famed, \"Corso\" is really just a well-maintained and broad walk across the isthmus from the pier to the beachfront. Along the way are very nice pubs, local eateries with great seafood to take to the beach with you (watch out for the aggressive gulls!), and a plethora of tourist gift shops.However, getting away from Sydney's high rise buildings and reverberating traffic noise is worth it! Take a stroll from the Manly Cove along the cliffs to Fairlight beach to escape the tourists and the seagulls."

Manly beach won,We took the ferry which was about 30 mins. Is a large ferry and its very busy, if its gets too full you will have to wait for the next one.We followed everyone through the open air shopping precinct to the main Many beach, where surfers are predominant,The beach is sandy and stretches quite a way.There was also beach parasols and sunbeds for hire for $15 each for the whole day, which is the first time I have ever seen in Australia, Even Surfers paradise dont have beach hire, you have to buy your own parasols and chairs.The downside to this beach was the weather had been quite bad and created dangerous riptides and the lifeguards closed the sea to everyone barring experienced surfers.There is a small beach where the ferries land and I was able to swim for the first time of my holiday, as there was no waves as such.It was very hot 28 degrees and you do need a hat, sunscreen and plenty of water to drink. What the promenade does have which we could with over here, are filtered drinking water fountains that you can fill up water containers or cups to drink.Plenty of shops for either retail therapy or eating, but a bit on the expensive side,"

We rented out Stand up Paddle boards which are stationed right next to the wharf on the smaller side near the boats and it was money well spent - the calm water is perfect for picking up the sport and the rates are really good value. There were 4 of us and we rented 2 for an hour and shared them about...was a brilliant day."

If you go in the water, make sure to stay within the flags or else you'll get yelled at and maybe pulled under. Went to the best fish and chips shop half a block off of the beach for some lunch, awesome."

When I went to the shop, I was told that it closes at 6PM. In the summer, the sun goes down at 8PM in Sydney so I was surprised. Yes, Bondi beach itself is more for the meat market crowd but the walk from Bondi to Coogee is absolutely stunning and well worth it. I would not go back to Manly if I go to Sydney again."

The beach is at the end of an entertainment corso and there lies the problem. The corso has many pubs and there is a strong drinking culture amongst young people. We visited Manly by ferry and you have to walk through this corso to get to the beach. We encountered many drunken people at 2pm in the afternoon both on the corso and at the beach. They can be quite intimidating when you have young children with you. This problem magnifies the later you stay at the beach as the pubs are open all day and night. In order to get back to the ferry you have to navigate through drunk people again. At this time of year the ferries are in great demand so very long queues wait to catch each ferry. Unfortunately alcohol and waiting in line do not mix so we experienced a bit of pushing and shoving as people tried to get onto the ferry. My advice is , if you have young children steer clear of Manly Beach."

The ferry from Circular Quay to Manly Beach was awsom with great views. Once I arrived at Manly wharf I rented a bike for 2 hours and toke a ride to the North Head area of the Sydney Harbour National Park. I absolutely recommend to follow the scenic drive within the National Park. You will find some amazing sights of a beautiful nature with cliffs and the South Pacific ocean, but you'll also have a great view of the skyline of Sydney. WOW! After the effort of that biketrip I went to the beach, had a swim and watched those surf enthousiasts enjoying the waves. That was for me the ideal way to relax.One the way back with the ferry we enjoyed a sailing race event just before arriving in Sydney harbour. It was really spectacular!If you're visiting Sydney, this has to go on your to do list!! It'll certainly be on mine when I go back!"

It was everything one would expect. There were people from all walks of life, enjoying a chance to lie in the sun, surf in the sea, walk with their dog, sit in the shade, or just watch other people. Luckily, we were guided by a local lady, who was walking a pretty golden retriever, to walk out to the Cabbage Tree Reserve. We truly enjoyed walking into a secluded area that led out on a ridge that divided the bay from the ocean. On the way we spotted a water dragon, and were informed by an older gentleman that they eat the extremely poisonous spiders that are found in the area, and therefore, \"He is a lovely animal.\" We enjoyed seeing the many groups of school children who were apparently on field trips to learn about water safety."

Plenty to keep one's mind and palette occupied. It has a real seaside, surfer feel about it and it is a very cool place to be.The surf on Manly can be some of the best in Sydney and the beach is about as safe as any with attentive and plentiful lifeguards. It is difficult to think why Manly wouldn't stack up against the best beaches on offer in New South Wales."

We went to Manly beach for the first time in several decades, catching the ferry over, strolling down the Corso, had a swim, then repeated the return journey.All in all a reasonably priced outing, certainly lots of eating places and an ice cream shop for dessert on the ferry wharf on the way home."

The trip took about 30 min but it was a great way to see the Harbour and the ferry offers free Wi-Fi. Once in Manly, we walked down the Corso to the beach. The Corso is a pedestrian street with wall to wall stores. The beach itself was fantastic. The temperature reached 37C that day and the waves were plentiful. We had a fantastic time in the water, trying to body surf , swim and also relaxing while sun tanning. Surf boards, lawn chairs and umbrellas are available for rent but we just used our beach towels to lie down on the beach. There were many surfers that day and it was very nice to see them trying to ride the waves. Lifeguards were present and they worked hard to ensure that the swimmer were in the water a safe distance from the surfers. There are several small shops to buy pop and ice cream. Public toilets were accessible and clean."

I have had a few return trips over the years, love the beach front(sorry Bondi) and of course the harbour. The Corso is the pedestrian precint between both and is still looking very sad and dated. The paving is drab and grubby and apart from a few traders who have spent a lot on their shops there is no character or interest in the pedestrian precinct. A good makeover and garden landscaping, a la Darling Harbour, would make it's unique location between the Harbour and the sea world class. However it appears the local council and chamber of commerce must think ordinary is good.Parking fees are $4 an hour, probably one of the highest for a \"premier\" beach location in the country.Cafes and restaurants along the beach front ,as well as the beach esplanade itself have had considerable money spent on them and are looking great.The \"famous\" Manly Wharf has a great pub and restaurant, unfortunately the rest of the wharf is rather grubby and draughty. Come on manly, get with the 21st Century"

There are several viewing spots with benches. They enable one to take a photo or to rest their legs if they need to. People are friendly here. I met a nice couple from America with their baby and enjoyed a nice conversation with them. Many mothers were wheeling their baby carriages enjoying the day.What a wonderful way to spend a sunny day when you are in Sydney. Try not to miss Manly."

The ride across the harbour is worth mentioning; you have to love public transportation on water. The ride takes about 40 mins. (on the regular, not high-speed, ferry) and, if you snag a seat outside, it's absolutely beautiful, with great views of the harbour's attractions (Opera House, etc.) and beautiful waterside homes all around the harbour. When you dock at Manly, you walk the promenade over to the beach. Simply put, it's a gorgeous Pacific beach, with great sand and great views. Beyond enjoying the beach itself, there are lots of trails, etc. for exercising, great people watching, and several stores and places to eat. You can easily spend an entire day here as a visitor; if you love the beach, maybe more than one! There is a place called the Bavarian Bier Cafe right next to the ferry terminal; it's a nice place to stop for a beer prior to boarding the ferry for the ride back to Sydney. If you're planning a trip to Sydney, Manly is a must-do."

Fairy Bower is a small rock outcrop on an esplanade which goes from one of Sydney's iconic surf beaches, Manly Beach to Shelly Beach, a pretty north-facing cove. Dive into the water and you are snorkelling in Cabbage Tree Bay Aquatic Reserve. This is a special area that provides protection and sanctuary for the weedy sea dragon, elegant wrasse, black rock cod and the blue groper. There are large underwater rock crevasses which house big schools of fish and paddocks of seaweeds in toward Shelly.There is a shower by the small ocean pool and a dressing shed. Fairy Bower Cafe makes great coffee, either takeaway to drink on the warm rocks with a croissant or have it at the cafe, sit outside and watch the passers by (they have a good breakfast and lunch menu).One more treat along the esplanade are the water dragons - lizards (monitors) which grow to quite a size and who live in among the rocks and stare impassively at you, not in the slightest bit fazed by humans.Manly Corso is a great walk, with plenty of cafes and restaurants for lunch or dinner. There is quite a Brazilian flavour along this stretch now as it is seems to be a popular weekend place for South American students.It is amazing to have such pristine water so close to a major city - Sydney which is just a ferry ride away, across Sydney's beautiful harbour."

It was such a lovely place. There seemed to be two different beaches, one on each side of Manly so we parked up on the street (which was easy to do unlike lots of places !) and walked to the first beach we came to, it was lovely but a bit strange that you are not allowed to go in the water in many areas as the surfers have priority ! We had a great lunch at a beachside bar, much to my sons delight you could see all the wonderful views on the beach whilst eating ! ( he thinks aussie girls are amazing ). We took a walk around the shops which are on a pedestrianised area and very nice whilst the boys walked along the prom, it really reminds you of old english seaside towns, but with more sun of course :-) yet at the same time it had a very cool vibe. I would love to go back to actually stay for a few days instead of a day trip. It was great and less manic than the wonderful Sydney can be."

Didn't really plan on going to Manly as we haven't decided between Bondi and Manly. We were walking around Circular Quay and on a whim, decided to take the ferry to manly as it was leaving in 5 minutes. That was the correct decision! We had a lovely time on the ferry. Short enough to be exciting instead of boring. Easy walk on the Corso to the beach. We did not do much. In fact we just sat around on the steps to the beach while the kids played on the sand. Had a quick lunch at a small Japanese hole in the wall by the library. While the young one napped, the elder one played in the mini playground in the middle of Corso and we did some shopping. Scored some super cheap Merrells at Platypus store. Got kiddie sized ice cream at Royal Copenhagen with non-stop sprinkles. Walked back to ferry dock and there was even a candy bar with about 100 types of candy to complete the kids' day.Perhaps it's because it was our first time in Sydney and I was thoroughly disheartened by the pace of it, but Manly was the perfect antidote. It was cheap too with the ferry (and Sydney so expensive). Would heartily recommend this daytrip."

Stopped for a delicious seafood lunch at the BlueWater Cafe on the beachfront which had quick and friendly service, and then worked it off with a bike ride (hired) along the beach and through the back streets to the lookout at Cabbage Tree bay. Before leaving we stopped in at The Four Pines microbrewery for a sample of their fine ales and watched a beautiful sunset across the harbour on the return ferry to Circular Quay. What more can be said!"

Literally just across the street from the Manly Corso and just a short walk from the Manly Ferry Terminal, it is perfectly located for a day at the beach, with restaurants and snack-bars just a minute away.  Great to combine with a trip on the Manly Ferry and a shop. Manly Beach \u2013 make a day of it!"

I don't know where trip advisor got their advice but, seriously, you would be hard pressed to find anyone sun bathing topless - definitely no nudies about. Manly is a beautifully clean city beach. It's hard to believe you're so close to a city of 5 million people when enjoying the clean sand and clear blue ocean of Manly Beach. It's a family destination by day and a party place by night - a suburb of split personalities with lots of walkers, joggers, cylclists and roller bladers in the morning morphing into a great night spot with something for everyone."

Handy if you are short on time and staying in the city, but if you want to see some real aussie beaches you are better off heading further north to Narrabeen or south to Cronulla. Better still, head out of the city and to the north or south coast."

My friends who have visited Sydney almost exclusively said that I must visit Manly, and if I had time for only one beach visit, to visit Manly over Bondi. I would add that the reason for that is not necessarily because Manly Beach is \"better\" but because it's more diverse. Manly, apart from the main beach also features the Shelley Beach, a smaller, more intimate place connected to the main beach by a scenic walkway exclusively for pedestrians and bicyclists. There is also the North Head park with walking trails that is a must see as it gives a lovely panoramic view of the city and amazing rock formations with crashing waves to add to the ambiance. You can either rent a bicycle and tour around or walk. I took one of the city busses to a mid point and walked the rest of the way, so from city center to North Head and back took me 2 hours. The trails are super easy to walk and very relaxing. You'll see numerous spider webs with enormous spiders. Since Australia has some of the most poisonous snakes and spiders, I kept my distance but still managed to take pictures. There are other critters around such as the goanas and nocturnal mammals, but I didn't see any. It also has neat vegetation most of which is short due to the hight of the rocks and the wind. I really enjoyed spending the afternoon there. I did not go to the Oceanworld as I've been to some of the best in the world."

We visited Manly in winter, and this was the only beach we visited due to the cold weather, so we can't compare it to the other surrounding beaches. The kids were out for July holidays (remember that's the winter down there) and it was a sunny Sunday, and the place was really packed. We walked along the ticky-tacky shops that you expect at the beach along the Corso, and grabbed some lunch to take to sit on the steps of the ocean beach. We then walked down to Shelley beach, and up onto the park hill for some ocean views. I couldn't say there was anything particularly special about this place, but it's the beach and any day at the beach is a good day."

We didn't spend much time at Manly beach though, as there was not much to do unless you are interested in surfing or maybe sunbathing. The beach was clean and very quiet (we visited in winter), but I think there are more interesting places in and around Sydney, especially if you are short on time. Not bad, but nothing special either."

No need to prepare and commute for a long time, just hop on the ferry and you're there in 30 minutes. And the ferry ride gives you a great opportunity to see the harbour. It's cheap, it's simple and it's always great to go to the beach! Even if you don't want to spend the day and carry all your beach stuff, just go for an afternoon, sit on the steps instead of the sand and you'll have a great time just watching the surfers and work on your tan!"

The ride across the Harbor from Sydney is okay but views are more interesting on other rides, when you arrive you have to walk thru blocks of shops selling identical trinket tourist junk before getting to the main beach. Worth going if you want to spend time on the beach, otherwise there are many lovlier towns and more interesting beaches in Oz. Rather than stay any longer once there, we took the next ferry back."

This Sydney beach is far preferable to Bondi Beach.The ferry trip from Circular Quay is fun, with passengers watching the city-bound ferry cresting the waves on a day when earlier, the ferry had stopped operating for an hour or so due to treacherous berthing conditions at Manly Wharf.Arriving at Manly Wharf on an idyllic December day, I took a short walk down the Corso through the pedestrian mall and then viewed a popular, though not overcrowded, most attractive beach with reasonable surf that on many days can be even better.The golden sand glistened, the two lifesavers on duty stretched out in a casual way but still scanned the horizon and all beachgoers seemed to be enjoying themselves.I hope that most visitors to Sydney experience Manly and its delights."

We ended up visiting here throughout our stay and really had a blast there. We liked it better than Bondi. This place has a CA feel to it, but has beautiful pine trees, nice beach. I have to warn people that night can pose problems in the Corso area, but no worse than other world cities. Great food, great shops. If you want souvenirs like shirts, etc, this is the place to go. The ferry ride here is alone worth from the trip (from Quay). We sat on the beach and just watched the surfers, some of whom were VERY good. The surf is for beginners, yet still dangerous. We saw whales frequently here as well. A must-do for any Sydney visit. Next time I have business in Sydney, if ever, I am going to stay in Manly and commute. LOVED THIS PLACE!"

Also seems to be choked with youth hostels and lots of young hostel people (no offense, but this was billed as a vacation spot, right?) Sunrise was beautiful though and the Lorikeets in the Cook Pines in the evening cant be beat for city side bird watching.

We are from a very samll town in Canada and the busy city was far from the relaxed getaway we'd hoped for. Once we'd become familiar with the city, we found Manly and the second we stepped off the ferry, we instantly fell in love. We decided to cancel our reservations in the city and move to Manly immediatly. Once we were there we visited the Manly Dive Center and with the friendly and helpful staff (hi Dave, hi Shmoolie) we couldn't resist getting our recreational dive certificates. It was the most amazing experience and made Manly even more memorable. The Manly aquarium is great and you can watch the sharks having a feed. There's also a healthy-foods shop on the corso I loved that had the best yogurt cups with real fruit. There's a local artist that arrives at night and does paintings with only spraypaint and random pieces of paper as his tools. I would recommend staying in Manly to anyone intimidated by the unfamiliarity of the big city."

Autumns are warm, and you can even go to the beach before winds comes from the sea and makes the air chilly. The wharf is so close to shops, supermarket and the most wonderful beaches I've ever seen in my life: walking along the Corso is something challanging for your eyes, meeting people, drinking something at cafes and visiting the diverse shops - and it's even more surprising at Christmas time! There are many buses and coaches if you want to go to Palm Beach or to Frenchforest... where a lovely swimming poool is waiting for you. I could go to Sydney City by ferry: and the view to the skyline approaching is something absolutely stunning! The ferry is fast, and the jetcat even faster... it was so great to go to the Opera House for some night performance, and immediately take the jetcat and get home in Manly in fifteen minutes!"
