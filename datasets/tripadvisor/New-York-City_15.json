Bryant Park is for Europeans, what a city park is - but New York does it better - with ample tables, chairs, coffee stores, games and better than that - faultless wifi ! It's outdoor living with indoor convenience - a place of solace just footsteps from the bustle - a great place to stop and take a break"

We were walking by the area and it was so, so hot that we were looking for a place to stop a while and get some shade. We looked across the street and there was a park we found out was Bryant Park. We got a lunch from an adjacent street vendor and ate on one of the many tables beneath the trees. Pleasant and relaxing to eat and watch the people and kids relaxing an enjoying themselves. There seemed to be a lot of locals. Gave us a taste of what it might be like to live in the city and be able to enjoy a neighborhood park in the midst of the concrete jungle."

I GREATLY appreciate the fresh flowers and constant attendant when I've been strolling through the city and do not want to buy another drink to earn a potty break!But seriously, the real great thing about Bryant Park is the ever changing activities. On this trip they were installing the ice rink and getting prepared for the winter market. There still were a handful of mini shacks that sold food and drinks. I noticed a South West lounge this time and even saw a free game zone where the public could sit and play games such as checkers and chess. In June I had a chance to sit on the lush green grass and enjoy a free sample of the New York Opera! Never overlook the parks in NYC, you just never know what you might discover!"

Fortunately, no matter how many people are walking - sometimes frenetically - in the surrounding area, the park seems peaceful and secluded. Even though construction is currently going on in some areas of the park, little noise is heard. Many folks are comfortably sitting and relaxing on one of the chairs (many chairs are colorful) by themselves, perhaps having a nibble from a one of the small kiosks on its grounds, or at a small table with friends or family. Trees or large umbrellas give some shelter if necessary."

In the winter, there is an adorable holiday market, in the summer there are movies in the park, free yoga and tai chi, musical performances and more. If you're going to be in town, check out their calendar to see if there is anything fun you can attend here. I've been to countless fun events here, including a free performance by the cast of Rent!But even if there is nothing going, this is a great spot to stop and grab a hot drink or a sandwich--there are a few food booths around. There is also a park library and fun games like petanque/bocce and table tennis.Also, insider tip, this place has the cleanest public bathroom you are likely to find in the city, so if you need to go and you are around midtown, this is the best place to stop. Finally, you can always wander into the New York City Public Library here, which is another underrated treat...but that's for another review."

I've also seen it when the green lawn was transformed into an ice skating rink, and little Christmas shops. There is also a carousel for children. It is an enjoyable visit whatever the time of year, and right next to the New York Public Library."

We walked to Bryant Park from our hotel and were surprised to find such a lush, family-friendly space in the heart of New York City. We admired the greenery - beautiful delicate trees and lovely planters filled with a variety of blooming flowers with various colored leaves. We were charmed by the old fashioned carousel boasting a frog and a rabbit, as well as the traditional decorated steeds. I took time to sit in the shade at one of the bistro tables and wrote postcards to friends and family. We walked from one end of the park to the other and discovered the classic architecture of the library with stone lions guarding the entrance. After that, we treated ourselves to a delightful alfresco meal at the Bryant Park Grill."

It's tough to add anything of value to all the great reviews here, but this is an interesting factoid.Bryant Park staff counts everyone in the park twice every day, at 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. You might be there minding your own business, but hanging out in the park during those hours means you've become a part of all sorts of systematic data used in making decisions regarding future park developments.Daily attendance counts often exceed 1,000 people per acre, even on days without special events, making it the most densely occupied urban park in the world.I can't visit the area without walking through just to see the people and reflect on the history here."

It's a relatively small park, located in midtown Manhattan, but there's always something going on, whether it's just people relaxing on the lawn or playing frisbee; or a communal yoga session; or a summer film screening.... I just sat at one of the free tables with my coffee and read my kindle in the summer evening air after a hard day's walking and it was just what I needed."

The staff were great, most helpful & explained everything & kept everyone informed of what was happening & how long the ice would remain cleared for.

I remedied this on a Saturday morning - first stopped to get delicious Belgian waffles at Wafels & Dinges, located in a stand in the corner of the park. After our waffles, we used the bathroom (a really nice, if crowded, bathroom - tip the helpful attendant if you have any cash!) and then settled into the Reading Room. Sponsored by HSBC, the reading room is open every day from 11-7 and is completely free. It was great to settle down and read a magazine to spend some time relaxing before lunch and a Broadway show. They also have scheduled talks and children's events in the reading room. A really aspect of a truly beautiful park - I will definitely be back!"

In the winter, it turns into a winter wonderland with an ice rink and village of booths selling Christmas goodies, trinkets and what not. The area itself is well preserved and with an open lawn and lots of seating around. The carousel is a unique touch - a real carousel in the middle of the city! Perhaps I'm biased because I work near here but it's an urban oasis for me and a perfect place to just unwind."

We sat in the chairs and tables (some with umbrellas) and had a blast people-watching. There were jugglers, people rolling diablos, basically a lot of fun being had at the Park. The flower pots had beautiful arrangements. Flower boxes at the nearby Bryant Park Grill were overflowing with colorful blooms and added to the cheery atmosphere. I had heard that there were bathrooms at the Park and nearly died when my daughter said she needed to go. Not knowing what to expect, we approached the restroom building with trepidation. The bathroom facilities were shockingly nice. The walls had beautiful mosaic tiles. Upon entering the bathroom building, you are greeted with a huge floral arrangement. Yes folks, that's right. Fresh flowers in a public NYC bathroom! Lilies, Sunflowers, etc. A large, beautiful fragrant arrangement. Once we got inside (of course there was a line for the Ladies Rm), there was a smaller vase of fresh flowers on the counter. Bravo to the two bathroom attendants (one in the Men's Rm, one in the Ladies' Rm) who worked tirelessly keeping the bathrooms in their tip-top condition! We were very impressed."

Its location is very close to Times Square but not as crowded usually. The Park has a nice grassy area coupled with wooded places along with cafe's and an outdoor bar. There are events such as Theater in the Park, movie nights, live music, square dancing and ice skating. There are also tables to play chess and board games. I would highly recommend stopping by when in NYC."

It\u2019s movies and music in the summer / skating and pop up shops in the winter. I work in the building facing the park and have a great birds eye view out my window of all the activity. It\u2019s a fabulous place for lunch as salad shops and delis line the streets around the park. There are plenty of seats and tables, but they fill up fast.

A few people heard our accent (from London) and came over and started asking us questions about the UK. There is a restaurant in the park but it was too late to start eating but it looked lovely. It was a place that parents obviously take their kids as there is not much grass around. I enjoyed the tranquility of the place"

If you want a quick bite it has little pizza places and various other goodies. If you happen to stop early evening, street performers will bring a little magic into your visit. Really, a magic show, street band and various other performers. Usually a little box or cup will be sitting out for those who enjoyed the show to throw in a buck or two. Nice experience."

There were plenty of places to get drinks and snacks. Since this is outdoors, it was sometimes difficult to hear the actors. They had mics but the ambulances screaming by and the police cars often interfered with the program. However, I would go again. Bryant Park is a lovely place"

This park located between 5th and 6th ave and 40th and 42nd Street next to New York's public literary is a blessing for tired shoppers. Lots of shade to sit and enjoy a cool drink or ice cream and people watch at it's best. Walk around and you will see people playing chess and table tennis then you'll come across a quiet reading area where you can pick up a book or newspaper. Your only asked to replace them when you have finished. A carosol and water feature for children, this green area is just bliss in the middle of the city!"

Completely renovated in 1992, this public park privately managed is an oasis of peace, cleanness and efficiency. Lawns and shaded areas, with plenty of benches and chairs, make the perfect scenery for relaxation and quiet meals. Adequate eating facilities are available. The beautiful \"Josephine Shaw Lowell Memorial Fountain\" at the western gateway, welcomes all visitors. Enjoy!"

It's just nice to experience less-known parks. We were here late morning on a Friday. Just in time for the bar to open! Terrific little bar in the park, offering light bites as well, but we just had beers. Sat on a swing (yes, a swing) in the bar. Very fun colors and decor--I think it was sponsored by Southwest Airlines. So there you go. Friday nights they do free movies in the park. There are also other food kiosks, a lending library (people still read! Yay!) and lots of games. It's a throw-back to they way people used to use public spaces. Before tablets and i-everythings. It was refreshing to see people have conversations and interact."

Because is such a mix of tourists and locals. Local office workers fill the park at lunchtime; the Southwest Porch and the BP Cafe are an after-work cocktail spot for locals as well. The park has cultural activities ranging from Tai Chi and Yoga in the summers to movies on Mondays nights (FREE! But get there very early, 5ish for a show that starts at 8 PM); free lectures and writing workshops. Lots of informal and formal food options: Belgian waffles or the cafes at SW Porch and BP Grill and Cafe (one is pricier than the other; I get them mixed up). The Porch is great for casual drinks; the food less spectacular. The BP Cafe or Grill on the other end of the park are better food options. But be prepared to pay premium prices. The bar at The BP Cafe is lovely and a bit more formal than SW Porch. But probably a great location to see the Monday PM movies without having to camp out on the lawn for hours! Close to Times Square and Grand Central, sites also worthy of visits. Close to the garment district (a few blocks to the south) where you can find great deals on evening dresses and a not so bad German beer hall (Reichenbach Hall at W. 37th). With a carousel for kids, putting green, ping pong tables and Petanque area. All free except the carousel. An amazing winter market during the holiday season with craft and art shops and great food stands. Best of all: the ice-skating rink. Free if you own your own skates."

IT IS ALL FREE!!!! You can sit on the lawn or bring over chairs from around the lawn to sit on. There are plenty of chairs. We went with some out of town guests and even though it was terribly hot, everyone had a wonderful time. The stated hours are 12:30-1:30. If you get there a little before 11:30, you will get a better seat and you will see performers warming up and doing parts of some of the numbers. The actual show ends a little before 1:30. They had some tents from their sponsors and you could go over there before or after the show. They gave out some freebees and there was a contest or two. Also, some of the performers stood around after the show to sign autographs.You can spend the day there - there are books to read, games to play, people to watch. There is an actual restaurant there as well as street vendors nearby selling all sorts of things to eat and drink. What a lovely way to spend the day in the middle of New York City. And, if you are not from the city, walk around to the front of the library and take your picture by the famous lions in front of the library, as millions before you have done. Great to post online."

My favorite place to sit is on the west side of the park, facing the NY Public Library, which is also worth a stop if you have a bit of time. And yes, you can typically find some chess playing if that's your deal. There is often some live music or other activity going on, so check the Bryant Park website in advance. Last time I was there in mid May, it was a picture-perfect weather day which meant the park was loaded with people during mid-day rightfully enjoying the beautiful weather.

I've always loved Bryant Park, so we stayed nearby for our toddler's first NY trip (I go often for work), and it was the highlight of her trip. She loved riding the carousel (she nearly bankrupted us on $3 carousel rides!), running in the grass, going to story time next door at the NYPL, watching street performers, and chasing pigeons. Most of the city was a little overwhelming for her, so the park was a great chance for her to stretch her legs, relax, and have fun. I can't wait to bring her back near the winter holidays."

It can look really crowded upon approach, but it is pretty large, well set out with heaps of tables and chairs everywhere. On a beautiful day just be patient in getting a table (south side - 40 St - in the shade) - same technique as getting a shopping centre car park, just cruise quietly looking for the slightest sign someone is moving! Once there the coffee and brownie at Cofeed is good, and the fresh rolls on the other north side also excellent. Try out the table tennis on the north (42 St) side along with a newspaper from the Reading Room. So much in such a small space - very NY actually."

Walking from our Times Square hotel to various sites in the city we passed Bryant Park several times. It was a perfect place to stop, relax and watch the locals enjoying their daily breaks. Many were relaxing and picnicking out on the grass. The fountain is lovely and we were lucky enough to catch a small band playing one day. There are several beautiful buildings surrounding the park and it just looked like a place you would visit regularly if you worked in this part of Manhattan."

They had the grass roped off to keep people from getting on it while i was there. There were also a lot of areas with trash collection (and piled up trash bags) along the outer edges of the park that you had to go past to get there which wasn't too appealing. Central Park is not too far away and I'd definitely recommend going there as an alternative."

There are tables and chairs throughout the park for people to sit and enjoy the area, whether they are eating lunch, reading a book or people watching. During the early morning hours there are fitness classes. Fridays during the summer you can usually bring a blanket and watch a movie while sitting and relaxing on the lawn. During the winter months it turns into a winter wonderland with an ice skating rink, Christmas tree and shops to purchase gifts for your loved ones in. The park also usually hold fashion shows and special events. It is definitely a great place to come, stop, and take a break from all the hustle and bustle of the city."

We didn't spend as much time here as we would've liked but even in our short visit we fell in love with it. Huge green space with people doing various things: picnics, yoga, reading, playing with kids, etc... There's a great little coffee shop in the park too, along with some fancy restaurants. It's a beautiful view as the park is located at the foot of the NY Public Library which is a great looking building. They have public washrooms and while I was dreading the need to go in there, I must say that it was by far the cleanest nicest public washroom I've probably ever used. They have a carousel My favourite thing about this park though is that they have an area where you can borrow books to read while in the park, with seating areas that are designated as quiet for those looking to enjoy their book. And similarly on the other side of the park, you can borrow boardgames to play. They even have an \"art cart\" where you can use art supplies to let your creative juices run. I've never seem such things at any park and I think it's simply amazing!"

Of an evening the inner green is dotted with friends, couples and families stretched out or enjoying the open sky. The outer rectangle consists of a series of shaded paths overhung with greenery with tables and chairs placed through out. Amongst the paths you will find a variety of entertainment and food options: a reading room, waffles & dinges, a sandwich shop, live entertainment encouraging audience participation, a bar and restaurant, a fairy tale miniature carousel that steps parents into the past while the kids love to ride, 2 restaurants: the Bryant Park Grill and the BP Grill. The first is excellent especially if you can wait for an outside table. The latter is loud and overblown but a possibility if you forgot to bring your picnic. The public library is also historically interesting and can be visited as well. The atmosphere is pleasant and friendly, welcoming to all so if you have some free time come on out!During the year, the private management of the park works to bring in seasonal activities and entertainment such as movies or Shakespeare in the Summer and ice skating in the winter.You don't want to miss Bryant Park - see you there!"

Our last visit was to ice skate. How fun!!! We choose it because we love the area and it was a little less expensive and easier to get into over Central and Rockefeller. Much more fun for my teen daughters than the crowds and lines and expense at Rockefeller. Better value, less crowded, nicer/safer feel!"

People were just chilling on the lawn when lunchtime came around. It's really clean, and the bathrooms are REALLY nice. There's also water fountains and food places around the park. The company running the park also has activities of all sorts, which I think is really awesome! This is a great place to chill and/or do a bit of work, since it's outside, very well-kept, and very shaded. Great park, definitely recommend.

We returned on two evenings after dark to see that the center of the park, a beautiful green lawn, was now magically transformed into a well-lit, charming space. We enjoyed a good meal on the Bryant Park Cafe' patio and had a drink on the Southwest Porch. This was the perfect place to spend quiet, peaceful evenings watching people come and go and reflecting on our NYC trip.

A father and his son met 'grandpa' for a bit of T-ball. Teens stopped and posed for pictures together in front of the fountain.This is a great place to relax for a while. You can grab one of the folding chairs and tables or lay out on the grass. For a delicious refreshment, check out Le Pain Quotidien on 42nd across from the park. Grab it and head over for 15-30 min rest."

Probably too crowded now to do so - I don't think they do them here anymore.Accessible directly by subway- check out the routes. Also by bus that stops on 42nd St and 5th Avenue. Centrally located!

My young adult daughter and I visited Bryant Park, which is immediately adjacent to the New York Public Library, on 5th Ave, around 40th St, after doing a free tour of the library. The park, which has been reclaimed from illicit activity over the past 2-3 decades, is well maintained, with a large span of lush grass, a water feature, a carousel, and plenty tables and chairs set up for people to sit and enjoy the outdoors. There are a range of entertainers who consistently perform in the park, including jugglers, musicians, etc. We hung out for about 1/2 hour to rest ourselves after walking for a few hours around the area and the library. It was a beautiful spring day, good for people watching. There was an operatic performance and a Shakespeare play that was to be performed later that evening. We didn't catch those events as we had other plans, but I'd go back there for the free events any day I had time."

Bryant Park offers a little of most of the things to love in parks, but no sports fields. Still, there is a beautiful and beautifully maintained grass area that is surrounded by areas where visitors can grab one of the hundreds of chairs and just enjoy the pleasure of being there. It has a lending library, snack bars, restaurant, and even a games area where New Yorkers pour over chess and assorted board games. I look forward to every visit I make to this park and encourage anyone visiting NYC for the first time to put it on your \"must do\" list."

My husband and I stopped here late in the evening, and it was just magical after dark with families, couples and groups of friends enjoying the quiet space."

There are ramps to everything. Bryant Park shares the block with the New York Public Library on 5th Ave. If you are visiting, make sure to pop in to the library and see what is the current spotlight.

It has two different faces for winter it houses a magical ice skating rink whilst in Summer this is dismantled to increase the grassed area with a stage on which performances of bits of the Broadway shows take place.its a lovely Oasis when you've been walking your feet off. We sat and relaxed as workers took time out from their desks to sit and enjoy fast food from the kiosks in the park. there were jugglers in one corner and the place was very vibrant but pleasantly relaxing. In one corner is a Toilet who's famed for its cleanliness and has fresh flowers every day due to log time legacy of a rich investor . Once you find it I'm sure that it will be a place you re-visit. After all it's free and if you look upwards you can actually see the sky !!!!!!!"

In the Summertime, it is a great place to read a book and enjoy the trees and beautiful old buildings. The Bryant Park Hotel and the Library are iconic. Bryant Park Hotel is to the south of the park on West 40th. Directly to the East of Bryant Park is the New York City Public Library. It is always cool, in temperature and tone. It offers a fantastic self-guided tour. There are quite a few good places to eat close by. The Grill at Bryant Park is solid for Brunch on Sundays or lunch and dinner. They book a lot of private parties, so call ahead for a reservation. Another favorite close by is Koi, if you are solo and need a quick bite, they seem to always accommodate at the Sushi Bar. If you want a talbel you must call ahead it seems to be consistently packed. The center of the park is a hub In winter. Check out the open-air market and the Ice Skating Rink mid-October through February. Since it is a State Park the some of the offerings are made available free of charge. Check it out before you go. My NYC seems to always include Bryant Park."

But in my opinion, this place is more charming, because you are skating between very high buildings. You can even see the Empire State. Also there is a cafe in this plaza too, and they put some christmas music, jazz, that makes you feel really cuzzy and kinda feel the spirit of christmas. There is also a market, where you might find hats, christmas accesories, hot chocolate and other sweets. A must see during this season, I highly recomend this place."

Small tables and chairs are scattered around the rink. The holiday decorations are beautiful, especially their Christmas tree.

The park itself is lovely with a cute little carousel, a nice little shop where you can by a cup of coffee or something to eat, and a few seats and tables scattered around. The park is in the perfect spot to rest your feet if you have been exploring and need to sit and breathe for a minute. I would take several in fact. It sounds as if there is often various events held at the park and if you are lucky they my be every bit as nice as the Tartan Day festivities."

Our guide was Amanda and let me tell you she knows her park's history, now and future - the park is completely privately funded that is NO Government money spent. So to be able to complete all of the changes and plans that they had without charging anyone is amazing. Amanda explained how the park was an above ground water reservoir back in the old days and how in the 1980's it really wasn't a place you would want to be near or meet friends - so the changes that this Corporation has made is just short of miraculous - the Park now days is busy every day (they count people so they have numbers to work on and amend their future plans) they employ staff to man \"rooms\" such as the ping pong area, reading room, games area and gardeners and so much more.But the highlight of the whole Park has to be the public toilets - in a city that isn't known for great loos these are amazing and modelled on hotel toilets - there is an attendant (1 male and female) keeping everything clean and making sure there is no funny business - seriously you just have to visit to understand just how awesome toilets can be.Along with the toilet attendants the Bryant Park Corporation also employ security that work very closely with the NYPD to ensure that the park is safe. No matter when we went to Bryant Park (which we did several times while in New York) we felt safe. We really enjoyed the tour and as a bonus it was FREE you just need to book on their website. Would defiantly do this walking tour again when next in New York to see how many of the future plans have been completed or if the way people use the park has changed their plans."

Shops open around Thanksgiving weekend and end the weekend of New Year's. There are so many neat crafters and my family always buys Celtic gifts from one of the vendors. I used to love ice skating there before I busted my knee. Overall it's a great place. For tourists, it's right by Grand Central and the NY Public Library, which is an amazing piece of architecture to explore as well."

The library is also nearby - I know you may wonder why go to a library on vacation, but it is a beautiful building inside and as a lot to offer - check it out, Also has a vey nice souvenir shop. There is a Merry-go-round for the kids."

We went to several other parks in NY but Bryant was our favorite. At night we watched people play ping pong, and people walk their dogs. During the day we ate breakfast close by and watched people just enjoying themselves. I adore this park and want my mayor to come see it so he can copy it back home!"

It used to be a nasty place, but is now very nice. Ping pong tables, board games, a kiddie carousel, little restaurants. And a huge center lawn completely roped off from public use???. This park, like so many parks in NY, has a black iron fence around most of it, which prohibits entering the park except at corners, and prohibits exiting the park as well. In the park design world that's a big no-no, and is thought to make people feel not welcome, and once inside, trapped. I had thought NY had figured that out by now. Oh well.

Not only is there free wifi, but there are even moving charging stations where you can power up your phone or laptop. There are boardgames available from mahjong and chess to Jenga and nearly anything that you might want. There's a carousel that plays French songs. Plenty to eat, whether from the different kiosks within Bryant Park or the sit down Bryant Park Grill or any of the many restaurants that surround the area. If you want something to read, you can alway walk a block to the MidManhattan library of the Main Library with the lions (Patience and Fortitude). If you just want some peace and quiet as well as to people watch in the middle of a crazy day, Bryant Park might be one of your best choices in NYC."

This park is surrounded by beautiful tall buildings with unique architecture.Within the park there is an ice skating rink opened from late October to Early March. Admission is free, but skates rental is $19. It may be difficult for city visitors to bring their own skates, but locals can find a pair of skates online from $30-$80.

The park seemed to be full of local employees taking their lunch breaks & with the beautiful scenery (& food kiosks) I could see why they chose Bryant.There was an assortment of games going on like ping pong; chess, etc, & some pretty impressive juggling. There was also an open air reading room with access to children's books; magazines & newspapers. For the kids there was a carousel ride \"Le Carrousel\" which had an admission fee. To add to all of that there were lots of pretty trees lining the park as well as a picturesque fountain.I would definitely recommend taking some time out of your trip & visiting Bryant Park - it's great!"

So on Sunday morning, my friends took my 15 year old to Macy's, and I went with the youngest here. Out of all the ice rinks in New York I had to say this was my Favourote. It's in a nice setting in Bryant Park, there are plenty of tables and chairs all around for spectators, and stalls from where you can buy coffee and snacks. There are patio heaters for cold days and the best thing of All is that proper New York music plays subtly in the background (we were lucky enough to have Frank Sinatra!). Also, if you had your own boots, it's free unlimited skiing!! Otherwise 15$ for kids. Very good value. We have decided to purchase a pair of ice skates for our next visit as it will save me a fortune!! Recommended for skaters and spectators."

Myriad leafless London plane trees gave the 9.6 acres a European look. We planned to check out the great lawn here that we had heard about, but instead immediately came across a 170-foot by 100-foot free-admission ice rink with oodles of skaters.A group of people were curling in front of the rink. This turned out to be one of the ice activities offered during an ongoing, two-day Winter Carnival. We watched the curling for a while, gawked at the William Cullen Bryant Memorial and the Gertrude Stein Monument and took in the view of tall buildings surrounding the park. It was mid-afternoon on a Friday and no crowds had yet arrived for the festivities. After a short stay, we decided that, despite the carnival, nothing really beckoned for us to stay here at this time of year. But I plan to return in summer to enjoy the park with everything in bloom."

A kind man on the subway suggested that we go to Bryant Park--a smaller rink but the only charge is for skate rental ($15). We were headed to CP any way so we checked there first. We only wanted to skate about twenty minutes so the $40 for admission and skate rental seemed a bit exorbitant. The rink is a good size though.Next, we headed to Rockefeller Center (it was on the way) to check it. The rink is tiny, crowded (as you would expect), and super expensive. Our journey continued to Bryant Park. The employees were friendly and really hustling to get people the skates! The rink was being Zambonied when we arrived but that was not a big deal to us. We had time to get skates and rent a bag (small $8) to hold our purses and shoes with the attendant. The small bag was plenty large enough for three sets of shoes and purses. We had a ball skating! There are rules against taking your camera or phone out--and the rink guards enfore this strictly! We saw them correct lots of people in the thirty minutes we were there. Everyone skating had a terrific time and you could tell the employees enjoyed themselves as well. Thank you for a fun break in the day!"

            "review": "A jewel of a park. Designed as a classic English public park, Bryant Park, just behind the NY Public Library used to be the site of NYC's drinking water reservoir. Ignored for decades, in the 1980's it was overhauled; the gardens were replanted and the stone work power-washed and repaired. Only occupying a half city block, the park has been growing aesthetically and is now an integral-- and beloved-- part of the dense office building surroundings since then. This year, Bank if America is underwriting a Winter Carnival: ice rink, \"Frozen Fingers\" ping pong tables, bean bag throwing, a beer garden and restaurants- all temporary- that enliven the park day and night. During the winter holiday season small vendor booths offer an astounding array of gifts and other goodies. In the summer you can catch office workers sunbathing, free movies at night, a vintage carousel, a few outdoor cafes and more than a few pigeons. The park is one block east of Times Square, so it's an easy walk if you are going to be in the 'neib. While New Yorkers seem gruff and hurried on the street, in the park they are laughing, smiling, and trying to still look cool on ice skates."

Okay, admittedly I did not even know that Bryant Park was there, and I was really just on my way to visit Times Square. But the park was pretty, well-lit and bustling with happy skaters. I did stop at the restroom, which was open and unusually attractive for a park restroom. I was amazed at how clean it was, and how it featured my favorite kind of toilet, which is the one which has the seat lined with plastic that renews itself with a touchless sensor. As I've found that New York City women seem to be particularly bad about peeing on the seats in the city, it was a relief to finally get to sit on a pristine surface. :)"

My family and I (husband and 2 teenage daughters) spent a very pleasant couple of hours here one afternoon before Christmas while holidaying in NYC. We had checked out the various places for ice-skating (my 13 year old daughter was keen to - as was I!) - and decided upon Bryant Park primarily because we understood that there was a German-style Christmas market at that time of the year. We were not disappointed. DD2 and I got to skate - usual half blunt skates - but I've never had it any other way wherever I've skated! So we enjoyed ourselves. DH and DD1 watched and took photos and then mooched around the stalls, finding a couple of Christmas presents for family members along the way. The Christmas tree was lovely and we were very glad that we had visited. Highly recommended!"

There are a few places to do this, but Bryant park was close to our hotel and quiet(ish). I highly recommend doing this during the winter months, I think it's open until May, but you might want to double check. There is a bar there for those of you that wish to watch, the stalls were closed, which was a shame, but the ice skating was our main plan.A must do, even if your a beginner."

The stalls have really good quality items so made a number of purchases with each stall being able to take cards which was great. The park looks great all done up for Christmas, and this time we stopped off at the cafe in the park, the food was good and it was nice to sit in amongst all the buzz of the park. My only comment about the cafe was as it was so busy service was a bit slow and they mucked up our order (to our advantage) by forgetting our 2nd chips but giving us the table next to us their chips by accident meaning they did not get their chips until well after they had finished the rest of their food. The staff were great though and dealt well with the the situation. It is initially unclear if you order food at the bar or it is waiter service again this was just due to how busy it is and they take a credit card off you when you order as security you won't do a runner which is fair. Would recommend it and will visit the cafe again if I get to go back to NYC."

They do have small locker rentals ($). They also have storage ($) for larger groups. There is also a small cafe inside for snacks and drinks. Not part of the ice rink are several cafes. One, I know overlooks the rink. Can't remember if the second one also has a view of the rink. Lovely ice skating rink.Really enjoyed it a lot!"

I am a native New Yorker and used to skate a lot as a kid so I revived my love of it in the last few years. However, on December 30 of 2015, a few weeks ago, I had a bad fall when some Irish or Scottish adult male tourist slammed into me, very hard, and a girl about 12 years old. I fell hard on the front of my hand and could barely move it for days. Luckily it wasn't broken but when I contacted the park I was told by someone named Kristen in the corporate offices that she would get back to me regarding filing a report. She never did. So the next day I emailed Bryant Park Corporation and someone named Rachel Zurier responded saying that their office would get back to me the following week, but they never did. So I emailed them again yesterday and asked about filing a report, but they didn't respond. Also for the record, when I fell, none of the skate guards came over to help, and then I was asked to move, while injured and in a lot of pain, by some man taking pictures of his family in front of the tree. When I told him I was injured he made a face and insulted me. Only the tourist who hit me tried to help. Be warned that when it is crowded here (and this was at 9:30am on a weekday, I went before work) there are a lot of people who can't skate at all and it is dangerous. I guess the park doesn't care about its patrons. I just hope I don't get tendonitis from the injury."

The Park shares the block with the magnificent central branch of the New York Public Library. In fact, beneath the park there are over 80 miles of shelves storing the library's book collection. The park is just a long city block from Times Square. Enjoy"

You can buy chocolate from Max Brenner (highly recommended) or you can get graffiti pieces from The Raw Art. There's a place which sells costume jewellery and another which sells antique postcards and signs. There's a carousel and a skating rink (rink in the winter). If you're walking along 42nd or 40th, plan on spending an hour or so with this really neat distraction, and be prepared to part with a few dollars. I did say 'upscale' and flea market... there's lots of quality stuff here, but not all of it is low-budget.

There is a restaurant near by we didn't get a chance to go in but I would recommend going there as it overlooks the park. I would recommend coming here in Christmas time to get yourself in the mood for Christmas."

Not sure what's there in summer, but at Christmas time, there is a Christmas market with about 20-30 stalls selling food and drink as well ad collectibles, clothing etc. interesting to look at but generally quite pricey. It can get pretty crowded (resulting in long queues at the restroom). The skating rink is quite economical (just need to pay for skate and locker hire) but compared to Wollman Rink (Central Park), the rink is quite small did crowded. The Park is short walk from Times Square."

In winter, it boasts a skating rink. Throughout the year, it has various events, including free outdoor concerts and movies. It is located in the very center of midtown, close to the famous 5th Avenue - the shopping paradise - and to other interesting places, such as the NYC Library. There are often Ben & Jerry free ice-cream and Starbucks coffee giveaways. Fashion shows take place here as well. What's not to like?"

At centre stage is the lovely ice-rink (which didn't appear to have any queues when we were there, and much cheaper than the Rockefeller Center) and all around the edges is the Christmas market, with many stalls selling lots of beautiful hand-made goods, and a number of food stalls. We visited during the day and evening and both visits were truly lovely. My daughters were too tired from sightseeing to want to skate, but had they wanted to, they would probably have chose to skate here rather than at the Rockefeller Center where the queues were very long."

We stumbled across this gem several years ago & it quickly became one of my favorite places to visit during the holiday season in NYC. It had been a few years since we had been, so it was definitely on our to do list this holiday season. They have a nice selection of holiday vendors selling trinkets, jewelry, hats, and etc. You can certainly find some unique holiday gifts here. There is at least one eatery should you get hungry. There used to be a guy selling chocolate covered fruits, but I didn't see him this year & that was a huge disappointment for my family. There is a HUGE Christmas tree and icing skating rink in the center of the park during the holiday season. The tree is beautiful. Ice skating admission is FREE. So bring your own skates IF you have them, otherwise there is a rental fee. We have skated here in the past, but not this year. There is usually a line to get in. There is also a neat little carousel here in the park. It is there year round. It is $3 per ride. Children under a certain height have to be accompanied by a parent, but the parent rides for free (standing next to child). The carousel is really pretty and features other animals besides horses. There is a cat, frog, bunny, horses and more. Our children really enjoyed it and the ride is of decent length. Overall, we had another nice visit with Bryant Park during the holidays. I would recommend it. Only downside is that is can be crowded."

We ate these delights whilst watching people skate one day.We had pre-booked ice skating for a few days later and this was fantastic fun even though the ice was busy. Well worth the money. One of husbands favourite activities on the holiday and definitely something iconic to do in NYC. Bryant Park is easy to find and to fit into itineraries along with 5th Ave, NYPL or GCT. The toilets are some of the best we used on our whole trip including better than those in Bloomingdales!"

We fell upon this smallish Christmas park by accident, what a lovely little find.Sadly this is not hugely advertised, but we thought this gave us the best Christmas feeling of all. We would stop here for an hour and enjoy a drink before heading back to our hotel. ..... little Nordic style huts selling gifts and crafts surrounded a pretty Ice skating rink which stood beside a large, beautifully lit tree. There were various food and drink options, served by caf\u00e9 style tables where you could just sit and soak up the atmosphere, or watch the skaters going round to the Christmas tunes being played. The whole place had twinkling lights and felt quite magical in the middle of a concrete jungle."

Start with the row and rows of vendors tents where you can browse (and purchase!) just about any thing: clothing, scarves, hats, gloves, candles, Christmas ornaments, jewelry, art supplies.......and so on. It's like being in a mall of tents. Food items are also available; hot coffee is a must in NY in December and there is plenty of it. Stop by the skating rink, or rent a pair of skates and have a go yourself. Don't forget to go around the corner and visit the iconic lions keeping watch over the New York Public Library.

We went a few mornings later for breakfast where we ran in to Bocce Tournament, which was a unique way to start the day.

Did we ice skate? no. however we managed to spend 2.5 hours enjoyed the ice skating, music, atmospheres, markets and general christmas vibe.I could not believe that the skating was free - wow. so great for families and travellers on a budget.And i must say that the crepe guys are NOT TO BE MISSED. Ummm - yum. I am now 100% converted to the crepe evolution with their fancy performed cardboard crepe holders...If you are like me- start slow with a nautili and strawberry...but I could have returned every day for the whole trip to try more option.Sweet tooth - over and out.#goodworkbryantpark"

Plus... hand crafted pottery and assorted objects. And there's food too. I worked in NYC for 22 years... and this is one of the best holiday traditions that New Yorkers and visitors alike can enjoy. Don't worry about the hustle and bustle... it's safe. Even if you can't find that perfect gift for that special person, you'll have fun."

It was the first time either of us had been and was easy to get to by subway. The Christmas Market they have set up is huge and filled with shops for everything from organic lotions to christmas ornaments to comfort food. We had a quick bite at the Wafels & Dinges booth, and loved it! Can't beat a warm waffle with tons of sugary toppings, even with the fall-like weather we've been having lately. We also went skating. While a little pricey (free admission but $19 per skate rental. Lockers are free if you bring your own lock. Lockers are small so I'd bring two locks depending on the size of your party. Locks were $9 to rent from them, I believe), it was a fun experience. I skate frequently so, compared to what I'm used to, the ice was pretty bad and beat up and it was too crowded to get much speed going, but that's not really the point of going. It's more about the memory with the people you're with and the experience. We went during the day but I bet it looks beautiful at night with the tree all lit up too! Definitely worth a visit. Another plus is that your visit could be anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours, all depending on you and what you want to do."

Rentals and storage for our shoes was easy and relatively inexpensive. Admission to the rink is free. The ice was not too crowded and we had no problem teaching our son how to skate there. A much better experience than trying to skate at Rockefeller Center with the huge crowds. Many kiosk shops in the park for food, drinks, and Christmas gifts.

I would be willing to pay for articles made in the USA, but not \"tat\" made abroad. I could find that in any dollar store"

Bryant Park's major December attraction is, of course, the Christmas market.To enjoy it well, you will need 1-2 hours so that you can see the attractions at leisure and work your way around the lines of visitors also weaving their way in and out of the narrow passages between the booths. The venue also has places to sit to enjoy something to eat and drink or just to sit and enjoy the sights. The handcrafts on display represent an impressive variety of crafts, and each booth exudes exuberant holiday cheer, even for those who do not celebrate Christmas. The ice rink also offers its own attraction, either for those who would like to skate or for those who just like to watch the skaters. Late in the afternoon shortly before dusk I find the market particularly attractive with the lights increasing in intensity--although not too much--as the evening advances. Bryant Park also has another advantage in its location because of its proximity to famous department store window displays on Fifth Avenue. Not to miss are those at Lord and Taylor on 39th Street and then advancing to Saks Fifth Avenue directly across from Rockefeller Center at 50th Street with its famous tree and esplanade of musical angels, also especially beautiful by night-light."

We didn't actually skate this time, but my mom has before, and she definitely enjoyed it. It was an easy walk from Times Square, with a subway station located right there at the park.

Second, it was a stop for most of the tour buses (we purchased OPEN LOOP bus tour from groupon, really good deal!). And third, the park was across the famous mille crepe cake shop Lady M (everybody loved their green tea mille crepe cake..except for me). Lucky for us, was able to try their yoga in the park activity which was sponsored by athleta.

Not only do you have to rent a locker but if you don't bring your own padlock then you have to buy one or you can't use the locker, so there's a few extra hidden costs which they don't tell you about until you get in there. It cost me about $40 to go ice skating which was a rip off but at least it got ticked off my list right?

It is not as crowded as Rockerfeller Center or around that area, and it offers great shops to find unique gifts. The ice skating rink looked like fun (I didn't try it), and the tree, although not as big as the one at Rockerfeller Center, was still magical. With many shops and food options, it is a great place to spend a couple hours."

Unfortunately, Columbus Circle's Holiday Market didn't open until Tuesday, December 1. Of the markets we visited, I must say that Bryant Park is by far my favorite. Maybe because I have visited it before, maybe because the layout feels a little less congested than Union Square, maybe because it is not as expensive as Grand Central Station, maybe because it has a nice eclectic selection of shops, or maybe because it has the skating ring, but whatever the reason, I came away feeling much more festive and ready for Christmas. Even with the light rain, the sights, the smells, and the sounds all left me with a greater anticipation for the holiday season. Great place to \"window shop\" and find \"one-of-a-kind\" gifts/stocking stuffers."

My only complaint would be that there are no opening times posted on most of the shops. One visit was just before noon on Monday 23rd November and several of the units were closed, with no indication as to when or if they would open that day. The ice rink is cute, with plenty of room for spectators."

There's lots of small shops to look at all around the park with the large skating rink in the center. The skating is free although skate rental will cost you (more $$ between Thanksgiving and Christmas). There were LOTS of people skating so it was just fun to watch them.This is a great place to visit if you are in the city looking for things to do. If you're not ice skating you could spend an hour walking around looking in all the little shops they have setup."

Situated right next to the NY Public Library and only a block or two from GCT, it is a perfect place to really just relax, take in the scene, paruse the various little shops, eat churros, and go ice skating. I consider this a mini- Rockefeller center without being packed in like sardines. By eye, the skating rink there is larger than the one at the Rock and somehow, the buildings are situated just right to have some great basking sunshine in November at 1 in the afternoon. There is a nice seating area, set up above the ice rink, with tables and cozy heaters. The variety of the shops are unique as they are plentiful. You could get some holiday shopping done here while stopping by for some tea. I think this is one of the nicer places in this area where you can feel quite free to relax and take it all in."

I loved the park and the area, but when we went to get out tickets to ice skate the lady (I wish i would have gotten her name) took our money and I asked if we needed to know anything before going to skate. She said no and joked around about not dying on the rink... okay my husband and I go skate and I get in trouble because I have my purse... well the lady NEVER said anything... so i go inside and ask the SAME LADY what to do... she said there are free lockers on the other side..... I agreed and thanked her... went to the lockers and the man said you have to have a lock for the locker to be free... okay... i go back to the SAME LADY and she said oh, yea you have to have a lock... and then directed me to go get a red bag to place my stuff in and they would hold it.... I go over the the bag service and the guy said you have to get a bag when you pay to skate....... SO I GO BACK OVER TO THE SAME LADY pretty upset and express my feelings.. she did not care.... i go to the next booth over and the lady was very nice and helped and was sorry for the service of the other lady....... Anyways, by the time i was ready to skate it took me at least 45 min to understand where to place my tiny purse...... LOVED SKATING HERE BUT DONT GO TO BOOTH #4"

            "review": "Winter Village Ice Skating at Bryant Park. Each year the park transforms into Winter Village, sponsored by Bank of America. The ice skating rink is the centerpiece of the village and offers free admission. If you bring your own skates and a lock for their lockers you can have a completely free experience. Or you can rent skates as well as locks or check your bags. No backpacks, purses or cameras are allowed on the ice. They're also strict about no phones on ice. We rented skates at $19/pair. And checked our bag for an additional $8, so it all added up. It was fun though. So much fun that I'm certain we will be back this winter. My daughter took to the ice like a penguin and sailed across it as if she's taken lessons before. The rink also offer stabilizing penguins which we saw some kids using to aid in balance but I'm not so sure they made it easier. Based on the amount of slipping happening around them I think it may have made it harder. We brought our own helmet, which I also recommend, you can rent as well. The rink wasn't too crowded, the staff manages everything well and it's kept safe so everyone can enjoy themselves. It was unseasonably warm yesterday so we wore just a light jacket and gloves. We probably should have brought a change of jeans or worn water proof pants. We ended up in wet pants for about an hour after skating until they dried.For the non-skaters, there is plenty of seating available so you can still enjoy the experience rink side. Or you can bypass skating all together and stroll through the open air market set up for the season. They have more than 125 boutique-like shops with items ranging from apparel to jewelry, decorative goods, local foods, and much more. You'll be able to find something for everyone - adults, kids, and even pets.We enjoyed some delicious warm churros with nutella after skating and took a much needed break sitting down and watched the hustle of busy shoppers and vendors.After our refueling we walked around to the front of the New York Public Library and marveled at the beauty of the building as well as the decorated famous lions out front. I always think of Ghost Busters when I see these guys.Then we walked back over to the carousel, it was swarming with giggling kids, trying to decide which animal to ride. For $3 each we took a ride, which was fairly long for a carousel. The actual carousel is quite small, and nothing particularly special, except that it's in a pretty awesome part of NYC. It's really cool riding in circles taking in the views of the park, the skyscrapers and all the holiday shops.That wrapped up our morning! It was a nice way to have special time with my little girl, getting us into the holiday spirit. If you're looking for a sweet 1/2 day family adventure, this is a great one if you're up for being on your feet most of the time."

Vendors of all types set up kiosks around the area and one can peruse until your heart's content on all sorts of trinkets, clothing, jewelry, food items, and more. People watching is also quite prevalent. They publish a map of the kiosks so you can track your favorite spots as you like. Skating can be had for just the cost of rental skates. If you want to relax and shop in the middle of Manhattan in a different manner, then a trip to Bryant Park should be on your itinerary the next time you're in NYC."

If you want to do a real NYC adventure bring your ice skates with you and ice skate at all the sites of the movie scenes. The rinks you have to visit are Bryant Park, Rockefeller Center, Wollman Rink in Central Park, and Lasker Rink at the North end of Central Park. At Rockefeller Center (Home Alone, Autumn in New York, Elf) you can skate really early with their First Skate program which starts at 7am--it will cost you but it is worth it to be one of a handful of people skating at this famous location which shows up in almost every movie from Harry meets. Bryant Park opens at 8, and you'll be part of a group of locals who show up every morning. Glee was filmed here. Nothing beats the free skating between the Market and NYC Library. Wollman Park was in Serendipity and Home Alone 2 and it is a large rink that gives a great workout. Another day head for Lasker Rink at the North end of Central Park. And then there is a teeny rink at South Street Seaport. My wife and I will head out to the rinks early in the morning, get our hour and a half of exercise and then head out for our annual traipsing.If you really want a different kind of NYC adventure, bring your ice skates!!!!"

It is exactly the kind of park you see on most tv shows depicting New York....the chess games...ping pong...late night movie showings...coffee kiosks....music..... we found it very charming. Could definitely see myself grabbing a coffee and spending hours in this park with a good book or just people watching.It has a real comforting, relaxing feel to it."

Pain Quotidian turns out a nice baguette sandwich and NY dog. There are free cafe tables for seating.

It's the time of the year where they will convert Bryant Park to a Christmas Village where there have little shops selling arts, gifts, food , etc and not to mention the great ice skating rink. I really enjoy this where you can just hang out and enjoy chocolate banana and peanut butter crepes, have a beers and absorb the atmosphere .. And then skate around the rink with the cool music! Just love this Xmas spirit."

Also, parking here can be a real hassle. Either take the subway or book parking in advance through an app/website like SpotHero."

We recently stayed in NYC for a few days and greatly enjoyed our stop at Bryant Park, finding it a most enjoyable place to spend time during this time of year when the weather is beginning to cool down. Trees are still flush green, food stands like Le Pain Quotidien and the smaller coffee kiosks are open and serving, the game tables still going strong on the south side of the park, carousel operating, just great. It is nice to see Bryant Park lively and being fully utilised by local residents and visitors. Autumn does seem to be a good time to spend time in Bryant Park for anyone looking for a bit of green space and escape from the chaos of the city streets.Grounds were being laid for the Christmas Market stalls and the ice-rink which should go up soon and be ready for visitors intending to be in New York during the upcoming winter and holiday season."

Come in Winter for a fun-filled experience on the ice skating rink r some holiday shopping, or in Summer for one of their open-air free movie nights.

The leaves were turning, and the sun was casting a wonderful glow over mother nature. As we joined the on lookers in the park it was a wonderful feeling to sit and feel just for a moment refreshed. Plenty of tables and chairs peppered the park for places to take in the magnificent views.After a few minutes of rest we were off and running again. It wasn't long before this wonderful sight caught our eye. We found the carousal, age doesn't matter, everyone needs to reach in and feel their inner child. Time for a ride. This being my birthday lucky me I got an extra long ride on the magnificent beast. Fond memories flooded back and yes it was great to be a child again.After a walk thru the park it was on to the rest of the itinerary we had for our day. I will always remember the park and that lovely ride. So if you need a place for solace in the midst of the hubbub of midtown, consider Bryan Park you won't be sorry."

In the summer, you can grab a book from the free reading stacks, settle down at one of the many chairs and tables, sip on an iced coffee and enjoy the shade under the towering trees in Bryant Park.In the winter - especially around Christmas - the park is transformed into a little winter village, with a skating rink and a multitude of vendors selling their wares from white 'huts' that line the walkways... No matter the season, there s always something happening there (check out their website) and it's a great place to rest, regroup and carry on with the rest of your NYC day."

Like so many restaurants that offer special locations(think: waterfront, atop a tall building,etc), this one trades its Bryant Park site for less then valued food. Nothing was wrong with the selection or even the look, the problem was taste-nothing tasted special , it all tasted common; maybe even industrial.The kind of place you go once and then let 5 years go before trying again and finding out its only 'okay'."

With the feel of a Old World park it has places to eat, chairs upon which to sit, large tress to give shade, and a grassy lawn to enjoy the sunshine. Of course there is a fountain and a very small carousel for children, but it also has areas for playing games such as table tennis and Petanque, and a library area in a quiet zone where you can borrow a book. It also has daily activities such as bird watching and an art cart. I returned for an evening stroll and especially enjoyed a Sunday morning visit."

You can choose to sit by the fountain and enjoy the gardens and the birds, perhaps read a book or a magazine in the free reading area, learn to juggle, putt a golf ball in the one whole putting green, or ride the merry-go-round. There are several outdoor cafes in the park, and numerous restaurants within walking distance so you can brownbag it.

We've also been there at Christmas time and it is far less crowded than Rockefeller Center. You can get much closer to the tree and ice skating rink. Check it the website for special events.

The first time we came across this park we were making our way North along Sixth Avenue after we had visited the Empire State Building. We climbed the stairs and approached the beautiful fountain which is adjacent to the Bryant Park Stage. At the edge of this fountain sat a Fellar Down & out on his luck but had set himself up feet up on the edge of the fountain with a stub of a cigarette and a the remnants of a discarded drink preparing to watch a country band who had just finished setting up. I knew we were in a good place to relax after the noise and bedlam of the NYC Streets. The Country Band who were playing for free were really good and we stayed here for a while with a drink and drinking in the melodic country sounds. we returned here on a few occasions."

Several activity corners dot the perimeter: petanque, chess, scrabble, english classes, karate, juggling, even a free reading room - open air of course. In keeping with the seven levels of stacks underground. Chairs and tables shared easily by anyone who visits, and quiet corners available.

They have knitting classes and language classes, etc. They have a section for children. It has food and coffee stands. They have fashion week! The winter is my favorite time when the booths open around the skating ring, and sell everything from hot apple cider to gloves to art work to jewelry and so, so much more and the Christmas tree and happy faces. It's a beautiful time of the year."

These few acres of green space are supremely well organised and tended, with everything one wants from a public park - lawns, trees, flower beds, chairs and tables for picnics and chess, a good caf\u00e9 at one end and a French carousel for the kiddies at the other end. Bird life of several species is plentiful, a plethora of cultural activities is organised there round the year, and the park has the best-maintained and flower-bedecked rest rooms in any public place in the City. Coming from London, I'd be proud if we had a park as nicely-run and maintained as this treasure is."

There is a ping pong table and plenty of newspapers and books to read on the north side, along with 2 small coffee and pastry mini-buildings on the northwest corner. There's a fountain and larger caf\u00e9 and little outside sit down bar on the west side along the 6th Avenue side. On the south side there are board games and a little merry-go-round for the toddlers and little kids. On the west side right behind the main New York public library there is an outdoor restaurant on the north side and an indoor one on the south side. It's also the area where there is a live piano performance, however I don't know how often that is. In the grassed middle area there are chairs and tables on the side and plenty of space to lay down and relax on a peaceful afternoon. There are plenty of performances during the summer on a daily basis, they have a sign posted in several locations around the park and other information."

The cafes around the park are reasonable in price. Try Breads Bakery - delicious bread, sandwiches, salads and pastries. There is a reading club/library and in Summer there are activities each Tuesday for you to partake in that are free. There was a knitting club too. This is my absolute favourite spot in New York. The New York Public Library runs along side the park too. If you're visiting New York, please spend a lunchtime here one day."

You choose whatever game you would like to play, take it to your table and play for as long as you like.....for free! Was also sweet to see all the kids on the Merry-Go-Round, as well. Go to Bryant Park and people watch, it's fabulous."

Despite its relative obscurity, in tourist terms, compared to its more famous Central cousin, Bryant Park for me was easily the more impressive of the two. Why? Well, mainly because of the activities available every day, ranging from art to language learning by way of Strip Tennis, starring Rafael Nadal, courtesy of Tommy Hilfiger! OK, that was a one off, but it was good fun especially for my wife! We went on two activities, a meditation walk and a tai chi class. Both activities were a great start to the morning with the former at 8.30 - 9.00 and the latter at 7.30 - 8.30. Although you share the park with busy office workers the sessions are calm contemplative affairs. Go along when you're in New York as this innovative park deserves your support and will reward that support with an experience that sets itself apart from the hustle and the bustle of this 24 hour city."

This time of year they schedule open air movies, and you can often see live music here (I stumbled on a Macey Gray concert many moons ago).

Back then it was a menacing area that felt unsafe to walk through even during the light of day. Not that you would really want to anyway. I remember it appearing forlorn, neglected, and hardscrabble. It is now a beautiful small park with a number of pricey restaurants; concert stage; food vendors in the periphery. This is not a destination place unless you are attending a performance of some sort, but it is a pleasant place to rest your feet."

There are sections where you can sit and they have games you can play - like checkers, chess, boardgames. They also have a schedule of entertainers or crafts or lessons on how to do things. It changes day to day and they are at specific times---so check their website. The grounds are nice, good photo opps and places to eat. There is a rooftop restaurant as well as another place, along with your typical nyc vendors close by if you just want a gyro or a hot dog to sit in the park and relax."

The Park is privately owned, and it shows right away with the cleanliness of the restrooms! During summer, you may wander in on a couple of thousand people doing yoga on the grass, or maybe a giant movie screening at night. But, any time of the year, you will see ping pong games, bocce, or people on the putting green. In the winter, the ice rink goes in, and the dozens of small shopping tents are booming. The park also has a beautifully decorated Christmas Tree in December. There is a small outdoor caf\u00e9 for adults only on the west side (beer served) and many food vendors throughout the park. I rarely stop in the city without stopping at Bryant Park."

All season long, tables and chairs line the park and offer a place for people to enjoy a warm coffee or other beverage or snack from one of the many nearby food stands.

The landscape is amazing, there's lots of seating areas and each view is different. You can escape the busyness of the city to take a fitness class, or learn a language, play some pingpong, or just enjoy the quite outdoor reading room. This is a very clean park. There's an endless list of things you can do right inside without having to travel far. Up for a class? There's a ton of classes that are open to the public and free. For the kids?There's a Carrousel that is $3.00 a ride or you can purchase a discount card. Need the quiet?There's a reading room that is outdoors! 1st I've heard of one with a mini selection of books, magazines, newspapers.Movie night?There's a selection of summer nights where the lawn is opened for public viewing of movies. Want to grab a bit?There lots a great restaurants in and surrounding the park.O Christmas tree!Not a typical touristy tree with ice skating but definitely an get busy.The location is very close to the New York Library another great attraction you don't want to miss. Each time I visit Bryant Park brings a fresh new memory."

We played Apples to Apples and had a ball! Go visit Bryant Park the next time you are in the Big Apple. It will be a great experience with wonderful food and free games too!"

The ride was CHEAP at $3 a go both for children and adults (adults I think!) and the view of high rise buildings, restaurants, a fountain and a big green area to sit or lay in the sun in; gives it a GREAT place to REST your weary feet and legs while the little one runs around(ish!) or for you all to sit and eat.

There are tons of activities that occur in the park and you can always be surprised with some form of art or entertainment. There are few places for you to grab something to eat or bring your meal to the park and eat at one of the tables. It's definitely a park to check out and enjoy for a few if you're in the area."

There were people playing ping pong and table games (which one can borrow for free from the game cart). There were food vendors and everyone really seemed to be enjoying themselves. There is also an area where a theater company was putting on Romeo and Juliet right there in the park for free. We enjoyed this park much more than Central Park."

I like to get a Starbucks (on the corner) and sit in the park. You may see an elderly rabbi playing bocce' ball with an Arab friend. This time, two gentlemen were attempting to play ping pong, children were on a field trip, a noted actor was sitting under the library \"be honest and check out a book\" tent studying his lines, and there was a special normalcy\u2026a quiet that made us relax as the park was surrounded by the hustle and bustle. This is where the library with the giant lions guarding it on the front steps is located. During the summer through September, movies are shown on an office building, and people sit on the lawn. That same lawn becomes an ice skating rink in the winter. Take a break in Bryant Park. You'll make a special memory of NYC."

The FEEL of this park is extraordinary. It is almost like you can sense the incredible history and stories that have gone on here for centuries - the lovers who have met here for a clandestine romance, the families who have laughed and ate while the pigeons jostled for scraps. This place has bags of character, the food stalls are good and I highly recommend it. I also found a great pasta shop heading 100m west of the park and then came back to devour my takeaway ravioli in the pleasure of this leafy historical park!"

            "review": "Bryant Park - Summer 2015. Bryant Park continues to be a wonderful place to visit in New York City with all that it offers \u2013 both permanent and seasonal. Centrally situated, it is behind the New York Public Library and Bryant Park Caf\u00e9, and close to Times Square, Grand Central Terminal and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It offers shade and abundant seating allowing visitors time to catch their breath, rest their feet, people watch and more. With numerous small food venues dotted around it offers a variety of food options. It also has one of the best (if not THE BEST) public restrooms in New York City. A recent early morning visit found that Summer 2015 has arrived in Bryant Park with a program of events from early morning through to evening. Dotted through the park are games, activities and diversions. Table tennis and paddes are set up and available for matches; the New York Public Library has set up an outdoor reading lounge under a tent with books and magazine to read and swap, expert recommendations and chairs to invite you to stop and read. A variety of classes are offered (free) including yoga, tai chi, barre, chess, mah jong, meditation and juggling to name a few. Game night with Settlers Of Canaan and Scrabble meet weekly and as do the knitters and the dancers. Many entertainment options are to be found, day and evening, including on Thursday highlights from Broadway with cast members; Jazz music, magicians and Shakespeare. Mondays are movie nights with an interesting selection of films to view \u2013 get there early for seating. The list of what is on offer is long and the calendar changes daily so check the website of the park to see what you might enjoy. Definitely worth the visit."

It's a little bit of heaven and can be very tranquil, even if it's busy. They have a reading room outside under giant umbrella's in the Summer, so you can sit and read in allocated seats, even if the park is busy. There's a children's activity area with helpful staff to take the little ones for 1/2 an hour and a roundabout, or as the American's say a Carousel that looks like it's been lovingly restored. On a Sunday they close off 6th Avenue by the park, and have street venders and a little market selling lots of food and gifts not just aimed at the tourists, lots of American's were there too. The caf\u00e9 in the park was a bit slow but the hot dogs, chips etc. were reasonably prices and good for a quick snack. All of the seats and bins were specially made for the park as they have Bryant Park stamped in to the wood, and when you think if you go to London and sit in one of the parks, you have to pay for the deck chairs there, these were free, and in a city that doesn't sit still, it's a nice place to just sit and take a breather."

The public were encouraged to join in and it felt like an oasis of tolerance and mutual respect amongst different cultures. Chairs and tables were liberally sprinkled throughout, so there was no difficulty in finding a seat on a hot and humid Sunday. We were slightly disappointed that the library was closed as this was the purpose of our visit."

There are also several food establishments on 43rd Street adjacent to the Park. It's a lovely place to come to sit down, have something light to eat, and rejuvenate if you have been up and about. Also, a visit to the NY Public Library is always a pleasant experience. They have free guided tours at different times of the day. There are also special exhibitions at the Library at certain times of the year. The park also has clean and pleasant restrooms on the 42nd street side.

Normally when one thinks about Bryant Park, visions of high fashion, couture, and industry experts come to mind. I originally imagined steel and concrete. My experience was much more romantic to my delight. Bryant Park is a quiet, lovely little square. A thicket of towering trees imbued with soft lights surround the area with chairs for you and your friend to talk about life. In the busy, hub bub of the city, Bryant Park is such an unexpected, lovely reprieve. What a little treasure and an absolute treat. I recommend going on summer's even before dusk so you can catch the twinkle in the trees against the background of a velvet sunset sky."

It is too small to offer a respite from the noise and crowding of the city, as is Central Park, but pretty and pleasant nevertheless. Not a destination in and of itself, but a nice place to stroll or eat a picnic lunch if staying in the area."

Art carts were set up with crayons, markers and supplies to create a make and take art project. An instructor did a nice class and the kids interacted with lots of young artists. a great FREE day in the park!"

There are many events that take place in the park, The best way to know what's going on is to Google the calendar of events. There is a large lawn area for catching some sun. there are chairs and small tables for eating and or just sitting in the park. There is a giant Carousel, several restaurants, a chess area, ping pong area. There are restrooms which I must say are kept very clean."

We stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel which looks down on the Park and spent nearly every morning down here having breakfast and almost every afternoon chilling out, playing a game or generally watching the world go by.Sandwiched between 5th and 6th and off 40th West, Bryant Park is just off the end of the main shopping on 5th, just around the corner from Times and Grand Central so it's a great place to end up if say you've started shopping at the top of 5th and 59th and need a place to relax afterwards.Check out the calendar of events, they're usually early morning, like tai-chi and yoga classes but aside from that they have a number of all day activities that you can get involved with that are \"managed\" by park employees, e.g. a board games area, ping-pong, boules, kuub and a small putting green.Plenty of kiosks for coffee, lemonade that sort of thing in the park and plenty of seating. Just off the park you have a PAX and an Le Pain Quotidian, Maison Keyser and Chipotle for food or the Bryant Park Brasserie itself for a more substantial sit down meal.If you're planning on attending the HBO summer cinema season on Monday, get there early.....!All in all, worth a visit and if you're staying in the area, a great escape from the hustle and bustle!"

Not only are they reported to be spotless but are complete with classical music and daily fresh flowers."

We all hear about Central Park but this little oasis smack in the middle of 42nd St on the way to Times Square is easily accessible, diverse and great for people watching.The park has many little \"precincts\" highlighting particular interests such as table tennis, bocce, board games, free outdoor reading room, cafes, restaurants, street food, activity lawn with a concert setting up when we were there and so on. And its right nect dior to the library. Thats a lot going on in a small park but the numerous benches and countless little tables and chairs provided by the city give it a quite enchanting, European feel. It has become one of my favourite spots in NY so do yourself a favour and allow yourself 1/2 an hour to chill out and just watch the city go bye."

First we stopped at the little kiosk that sold ice cream and other yummy goodies. The kind lady at the kiosk recommended the Spekuloos ice cream because it made her happy each time she ate it. I will vouce that it brought nothing but happiness. With ice cream in hand we sat by the fountain to enjoy our sweet treat. After that we continued around the perimeter of the park and enjoyed watching a heated chess match in the midst. There was also a birthday party at the carousel and many people were enjoying the green space and the sun. It truly was a highlight of our trip to the city and it is a place I will return."

It's a lovely place to sit a rest away from the bustle of the city. there's plenty of tables and chairs, and also ping pong tables and small cafes, a library etc. There's always something going on - open air cinema, Shakespeare in the Park etc, but it also manages to maintain its peacefulness no matter how busy it gets.Toilets were also clean."

After having a cup of coffee with him, I took off to walk around while he finished his work day. It was a beautiful day in Manhattan and I literally stumbled upon Bryant Park. What a surprise to find this huge green area in downtown Manhattan. I was particularly impressed by the reading area for newspapers and magazines- essentially an outdoor library. People were sitting and laying out sunning themselves, enjoying the nice weather. I wandered around enjoying the views of both the park and the surrounding skyscrapers. I noted there is a restaurant/bar area on one end although I did not stop there. I highly recommend a visit to this park if you\u2019re anywhere near the area. Enjoy the pictures and I hope you found this review helpful."

Bryant Park\u2019s Lawn, where thousands of nature-starved office workers gather for lunch on any fine weekday, is planted with a rye/fescue/bluegrass mix. The lawn is as long as a football field (300 feet) and 215 feet wide. Along the Northern and Southern sides of the park are twin promenades bordered by London plane trees (Platanus acerifolia). This is the same species found at the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris, and contributes a great deal to Bryant Park\u2019s European feel. These trees can grow up to 120 feet in height.Today\u2019s version of Bryant Park\u2014with its gravel paths, green chairs, and jaunty le carrousel\u2014is a recent invention. Though the space has been called Bryant Park since 1842, the park has had a checkered career. By 1979, it was the site of frequent muggings and drug deals and was avoided by knowledgeable New Yorkers. An almost ten-year effort, begun in 1980, transformed the park and its reputation."

In the Spring you can relax on a well manicured lawn, have a picnic, read a book, etc. There are vendors available for food. In the Winter the grass is replaced with an ice rink. Ice skating in the middle of the city was great. I preferred that over skating in Central Park. Anytime of year, it's a great place to visit."

Nice to see people taking breaks from frenetic NYC and enjoying the sunlight, drinks at the Bryant Park Cafe or Grill or sitting on the lawn. We were here in May with signs reading \"Lawn Closed\" - a first with the gorgeous green lawn spanning this city block behind the sign. Great location behind the NYC Public Library and its restroom facilities. Quite different from Central Park with the purposely natural, rugged look Central Park tries to maintain. Bryant Park is manicured, a park for city workers to enjoy a breath of fresh air. The Christmas tree and kiosks during the holidays and ice skating rink during the winter provide a completely different experience. Anytime of the year, it's hard to be disappointed at Bryant Park, and certainly the lawn is opened now!"

They associate midtown manhattan with all of NYC which is so wrong! There are so many great local small parks with people running dogs and enjoying themselves over giant parks like this filled with tourists. However, on a day where I walked from Battery Park to Central Park I did grab a coffee at starbucks and find myself enjoying a nice song or two from a band playing with great views from the park of the NYC Library and the Empire State Building. It was a great place for a refreshing stop to relax for 10 minutes... but I couldn't handle the crowds and had to move on to see other things."

Lots of people were just relaxing at the numerous tables dotted throughout and it made for a nice stroll around the square. Tried to get a drink at he bar another night but it was absolutely heaving with what looked like loads of business men who had just left a conference.

I forget exactly what he was doing - some kind of a measurement thing - but he was fascinating. Had the cream cheese and sweet potato sandwich at Which 'Wich. If you're wondering, there's a reason no one else has thought of that combination. But the best thing is the free restroom. The ladies' room was spotless, had fresh flowers and an attendant who didn't demand a tip - although you could leave one. Get this - it smelled great from the flowers.

In the summer it's wide open with day slackers and tourists meandering to and fro. Movies and concerts are shown on some evenings. In the winter, you'll find a skating rink and lots of holiday shopping. Fashion runway shows are held here at least twice a year. When I was a young man I worked directly across the street and would often have a lunch sandwich here. Then it was populated largely by drug dealers and addicts. But lunch time was O.K.

I've worked across the street from Bryant Park for five years, and I'd choose to visit the park over Times Square (which is nearby) any day. Bryant Park is basically lovely. It has a pretty fountain in the middle, and a few restaurant/bar options-- it even has a tiny carousel! There are some trees, and even a big lawn of grass in the warmer months that people lounge on. There are plenty of chairs and tables (but it's difficult to nab one on a nice day at lunch hour.) In the late fall the park is transformed into an enchanting Christmas village of shops, and the lawn becomes an ice skating rink. All in all it's a great place to take a break, do some people watching, and feel like you're in touch with nature a bit in the middle of the big city."

Where else would you like to take a break and let your feet rest from walking in the city?It is close to 5th Ave, 2 blocks away from Times Sq. There is a cafe on the east side and a kiosk on the west. My favorite snake is to get a NYC hot dog before I enter this park and eat it there.There is a colorful carrossel for the kids (for a small fee). In summer you may hit a movie in the evening or an excercise session in the morning. Enjoy."

There are plenty of caf\u00e9s for takeaway eats, and the entertainment is abundant and all free. There are yoga classes, juggling classes, foreign language classes, as well as music recitals, a reading area, table tennis and stories to listen to. All in all well worth a visit."

This park has its own community and it's only about 5 mins walk from Times Square.

You can also just sit or lay down on the many chairs/benches or grass should you wish and watch the interesting NYC life go by....."

Vendors also sell warm cider, roasted chestnuts, cookies, and more to munch on as you slowly make your way through the shops. The ice skating rink is busy but not crowded and the tree was beautiful!

Overall, it is a sight to behold and an absolute must-see should you be lucky enough to see New York City during the holiday season!"

It is located between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and between 40th and 42nd Streets in Midtown Manhattan.Although technically the main building of the New York Public Library is located within the park, effectively it forms the park's functional eastern boundary, making Sixth Avenue the park's primary entrance. Although part of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Bryant Park is managed by the private not-for-profit corporation Bryant Park Corporation. The park is cited as a model for the success of public-private partnerships.Bryant Park is built entirely over an underground structure which houses the New York Public Library's archives. In the 1980s, the park was closed to the public and excavated. The new library facilities were built below ground level and the park was restored above it."

The grass was closed off at first to protect it whilst it grew but then opened up on 11th May. It's beautiful. It just has the nicest atmosphere right in the heart of the busy city. There is even free wi-fi. I never saw any but they were advertising summer fitness classes such as yoga and tai chi which is lovely. And the carousel is so cute!"

It's basically a big public park with lots of cafe's, bars, street vendors around the edges of it. It has got loads of tables and chairs all around the park, anyone can go and sit in there, you see tourists, families, workers on their lunch breaks. It made me smile to think that if something like this was in England someone would wreck it or would have stolen all of the tables and chairs after a few days of it being open. Places like this in England tend to lock down their furniture. We found this just by accident really, we came out of our hotel after we had landed in New York and just stumbled upon it, we just sat outside with a soft drink and enjoyed the weather. We said we would come back one night because it was so peaceful and relaxing but New York is so big and there is so much to do we never found time."

The park has plenty of seating at bistro tables which make it a wonderful place to enjoy breakfast or lunch from a nearby vendor. During the summer, don't miss Broadway in Bryant Park which showcases current Broadway shows performing selections from the show at lunchtime for free."

Get there around 4 ( at least) to grab a spot on the grass(once work gets out at 5 it will be hard to get a spot) and have a little picnic. Then once the sun goes down u can enjoy a great movie under the stars with your friends. Most ppl bring snacks, sandwiches and wine(don't make it obvious as open containers of liquor are not allowed in NYC).Happy hour is pretty good at the restaurant, but don't expect it to be cheap.

As a child growing up in the prosperous suburbs, I was repeatedly warned by family and teachers to avoid the Times Square area at ALL costs. Bryant Park, like most the neighborhood, was filled with drug dealers, drug addicts, street walkers, beggars, homeless people - just the worse face of America. A Russian TV station from the old USSR did in fact a documentary on the homelessness and destitution in America - and filmed exclusively around Bryant Park/Times Square.Fast forward 20 years to today and Bryant Park is the \"Jardin Luxembourg\" of NYC. Clean, hip, cool, trendy cafes and kiosks, real green grass without dog litter. It all shows why foreigners are willing to pay $5, $10, $50 million for an apartment in NY!! "

I simply love this place: amongst the hustle & bustle, noise & fumes, of the big city, Bryant Park is the equivalent of the oasis in the middle of a desert.If you really want to see the NYC world turn, then sit here for an hour or so, at any time of day, and watch the people, events and wildlife, you'll be surprised at the richness and diversity and all that makes NYC what it is.During my seven day stop, I always ended up back here: whether for breakfast, lunch or a light dinner - it really was my watering hole, where I could either plan the day ahead or review what I'd achieved and done. There is always something happening whether yoga/qi gong/fitness in the early mornings, to evening theatre & entertainments. And even if it is quiet, there are always the people, getting on with their lives, to watch.The Park is very convenient to get to with it's own subway station, and is very close to Grand Central and Times Square etc."

There are tables and chairs for the public to use whether they are buying food from a stalls within the park or bringing their own. The atmosphere was very relaxed with mostly couples and families milling around the fountain and coffee shop, enjoying the warm evening air and unobtrusive lighting.The second time was on a sultry Tuesday afternoon around 12.30. The park was full of people enjoying the sun on their lunch break, Although there were lots of people sitting on the grass and using the table and chairs on the paved area, there was still plenty of space to sit without being shoulder to shoulder. Nothing like the scary place NY was portrayed as being in any movie from the 1980's!"

Bryant Park is beautiful and would highly recommend a visit to it. We sat in the sun and watched the world go by.Before we left the Park we paid a visit to the toilets there and what can I say ? I've never seen toilets like them in a public park. They were spotless clean and very well looked after. The Fresh flowers around the toilets were really beautiful. The day we were there, there was a Lady called Rosanna on duty. She was such a lovely friendly lady. It was obvious she was very happy in her job and I just hope she's appreciated."

It is also has a bunch of little stores and kitchens that sell unique food and crafts. The mix is easy and not daunting or overwhelming. In the winter they have Ice Skating and in the summer books, table games and table tennis. During Fashion week the place is even more interesting, but access to the park is limited.

In the park there are numerous benches, easy chairs and drinking fountains making this a go to spot in an otherwise drab midtown area. I love the energy of the place and all visitors whether young or old like to come and gather here."

I love it here. Beautiful.... busy but still a place to sit and unwind. I happened to arrive for Lilly Pulitzer fashion event offering free juice, hammocks and lawn chairs..pink water in the fountain, designers painting, fashion show and of course a huge tent set up to sell her apparel (soon to be available in Target).

There is a big grassy area in the middle with chairs and table on three sides.

There are many sitting areas, including a section for reading (with items on loan to read right there) and an extensive game area where one can check out board games or play chess or backgammon, which is set up at several tables. My 12 year old daughter got to play 3 games on our visits and she got some invaluable \"coaching\" from a very nice park worker in the chess area named Greg. We will definitely return on any visit to the city."

Bryant Park has come a long way since the 80's and is now a lovely place to visit while in midtown, finally worthy of its position behind the main branch of the magnificent NY Public Library. If I have any complaint it's that it's often too crowded now, but it's still a good place to relax and enjoy the greenery among the concrete jungle of midtown. There's a 'wichcraft sandwich kiosk that serves terrific sandwiches, so you can try to snag a table and enjoy lunch outdoors in the good weather, which I do sometimes with colleagues since I work nearby. There's lots of fun stuff to do, such as the ice rink and carousel, and in the summer the evening outdoor movies."

We went in November when the weather was still warm and it felt great to skate outdoors without freezing. There are tiny lockers inside, or you can pay $10 (I think) to rent a gigantic bag to check in all your shoes and other items that you don't want to hold while skating.

It was one of the coldest days in NYC in years (hence, the frozen fountain) but the temperature was no bother.

We missed the tree and the booths this year, but the rink was still packed. Even during non-Christmas times of the year, the park is beautiful and things to do. You can sit and people watch and also play checkers at one of the tables. Very peaceful and relaxing part of the city"

The Skating rink was pretty large and the skates were in good condition. It was a great experience. We also loved the little kiosks with different foods and retail items.

After a rather turbulent time during much of the 20th century, Bryant Park seems to have been revitalised as part of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation back in the 1980s. Today, you will find Bryant Park to be a lovely city park, particularly during the winter time when the ice rink and Christmas Market are taking place at the park. Park benches a plenty as well as a restaurant and summer kiosk/bar makes this a great spot for visits during warmer months as well. We highly recommend passing by Bryant Park during the winter if you are in NYC. It makes a nice resting point if you have visited attractions in the area or are walking back to the Times Square area from Grand Central Station. Park environs are festive during the holiday season and you can you really appreciate this well maintained city park for what it has become in recent decades."

We stopped and had a Turkish coffee, baklava and borek for a snack. So yummy!Love the neighborhood, with it's obvious mix of tourists and locals walking their dogs, and the international vibe so prevalant all over the city. Just one of our favorite spots!"

There is a waiting line to skate, but not nearly as long as the ones at Rockefeller Center and Central Park. It's so close to Times Square, so if you need a break from the stores and hustle/bustle of the Square, head down 42nd Street to Bryant Park.

In the Winter, it blew me away--like a true Winter Wonderland! So many pieces brought it together perfectly:-The Skating Rink: crowded almost all the time, fun to watch but long lines to skate. Skating is FREE but there are fees for skate rental and lockers/bag check. I wanted to skate, but hours in line was not appealing. So I went one morning right as the rink opened at 8am. No line, no crowd, a wonderful and serene experience! -The shops: LOVED all of the artisan shops from all over the city with unique items. So great to see talented artists and custom items that you would have literally had to scour the entire city to find all in one place. Bought a ton!-The food: Seasonal food everywhere, cider, hot chocolate, coffees, sweets, everything! My favorite was the tried and true Grilled Cheese and Soup from 'witchcraft. Went everyday we were in town. So festive, so much to see!"

Great people watching. And being slightly elevated from 6th Ave gives it a sense of calm.My only gripe is the food and beverage offerings. The Southwest Porch is always out of food or not serving food and is generally lacklusters. The 'wich booths are with closed or just boring. Bring your own Chipotle from across the street."

I particularly liked the some of the jewelry stores and the artisans who did fused glass and spun silver. In addition, I never pass a shop that has cup towels and wine bottle aprons without smiling at their cute sayings on the linens and, of course, I always have to buy some of them.

I've worked in Manhattan for two years, and I'm moving next week, and this is one of a handful of places in the city I will truly miss.There's just something magical and quintessentially NYC about it for me. The great view of the Empire State, the view of the equally picturesque \"radiator building\", the well manicured open \"green\" in the middle (except in winter when it becomes an equally lovely ice rink and winter market), the beautiful classical architecture of the library framing one end, the bustle of 42nd street framing another, the little food kiosks (love the tuna sandwich at Wichcraft), the bevy of nice tables and chairs (with \"Bryant Park\" stamped on them) set out, where people can often be found reading books from the free outdoor library, etc.Grab some food, find a chair near the fountain overlooking the green, and people watch- it makes for a perfect NYC lunch break.

They are done in a very cute way and decorated to make the park come alive as a Christmas Village. It was fun to walk along the paths and see the displays. The outdoor skating rink was exciting to watch as the skaters whirled around. I had an enjoyable afternoon here and would recommend it to anyone as a great way to spend the days."

The park is charming and the rink is surrounded by glass walled tiny shops selling everything from hot chocolate and food to unique gifts and jewelry. There's a restaurant at one end of the rink but we did not visit it. Very pleased with the experience - felt like I was in Europe."

Located behind the NY Public Library, The Winter Village in Bryant Park is a not-to-miss attraction when visiting the city for the holidays. From October through March, the park is transformed into a winter wonderland, including an ice skating rink, holiday shops (Oct-Jan) and a pop up indoor/outdoor restaurant called Celsius. Ice skating is free and open to the public from 8am-10pm each day (skate rentals are $15 for 1.5 hrs). The line for skating does get very long, so queue up early. There are several dozen kiosks within the park featuring a wide array of crafts and goods and eateries. In the middle of the park is a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. An outstanding restaurant called Bryant Park Grill serves a great brunch on the weekends along with lunch and dinner. And the wonderful Celsius is a great place to take a moment for dessert and drinks, or light snacks as you watch the skaters. I recommend sitting outside on the couches under the heat lamps. The cocktails there are yummy, cold or hot. A popular kiosk is Max Brenner's Chocolatiers where you can pick up a creamy, rich cup of hot chocolate as you browse the booths. Perfect for a night out in the city. In the summertime, the park becomes a calm resting area, with trees and flowers, along with a year-round children's playground and carousel. You can also play a game of table tennis for free at one of the four ping pong tables. There are benches and lounge areas throughout the park and a pretty fountain in the middle. A great place to relax among the chaos of the city."

I recommend the crepe cafe for a delicious crepe with anything you can imagine on it and a hot chocolate or coffee. The ice skating rink is very spacious and located in the middle of the winter village with a Christmas tree that may not be as big as Rockefeller's but it certainly gives it competition. The winter village is also nice if you want to experience some of Christmas in New York without the giant crowd at Rockefeller Center."

My only complaint is that there are no bathroom facilities considering the number of food stands they have. They need to construct a bank of \"job johnnys\" for the comfort of the visitors."

Ofcourse the first thing someone wants to visit in NYC during Christmas time is Rockefeller Center to see the tree, but actually I think visiting Bryant Park's Holiday Shops/Ice Rink/ and Tree is more amazing! There are tons of shops containing all kinds of items, perfect for youself or for people you are shopping for. Items range from jewelry, winter acessories, christmas decorations, artwork, nyc photography, perfumes/lotions, world shops (inlcluding but not limited to Irish and South American shops). There are also food vendors that have anything from hot cider to fried pickles! I haven't personally used the iceskating rink but it is fairly large and the tree resides right behind in near the library, a perfect photo op! I have heard it is much cheaper that iceskating at Rockefeller Center and the lines are shorter. If your looking to lounge in the park all day they have tables, as well as ping pong tables to keep any sort of traveler occupied!"

In the summer time, there are concerts on the lawn and chairs and tables to sit, ping pong tables, bocci, library and a carousel for the children. They also have puppet shows by the carousel. There is a lovely restaurant on the grounds also. There is a public bathroom which is kept immaculate, yes that's correct crazy as it might seem."

It becomes a cute wonderland during the cold season when it's decked out with tiny lights at night and you see plenty of ice skaters enjoying their time in the rink. There are also the usual market fair with plenty of merchants selling Christmas stuff. Another great stuff about this cute park is that it offers park goers the chance to grab some packed meals from nearby food outlets in and out of the park. There are plenty of tables and chairs to use when you want to have a quick bite, enjoy a good book, tinker on your computer or smart phones/tablets (due to the free public wi-fi access!!!) or just simply sit there to soak it all in because it's a lovely park.It's very near the New York Public Library and subway station (42nd/5th). 2 blocks away is the Grand Central Terminal, 1 block away from Times Square and about 15 mins. walk to the Port Authority bus terminal."

My daughter went on her first Carousel ride here in the Spring, and experienced her first Winter Festival this December. Even when there are no events going on, it's a beautiful place to spend some quality time. We love that there are always books to read if you happen to forget your own. In the Winter, the park transforms into a magical Wonderland, that feels like the joy of the season captured and tucked into this heart of a park in the city. Everything smells wonderful, the Vendors are generally cheerful and helpful, and watching the ice skaters is always fun. The best part is there is no cost to get in, window shop, or watch the ice skaters. Having grown up in NYC, going back there always feels like returning home, and Bryant Park is always one of the places I miss most."

The ice skating rink is open from early morning until late in the evening (try to go off hours for a less crowded experience) and the many little shops & restaurants are chock full of interesting things to buy. My original review of the pasrk from the summer folllows: \"Bryant Park has become, next to Central Park, the best park in NYC for tourists or even locals needing a quick break. Besides just being a great place to chat with friends and people watch over a coffee, soft drink or cocktail at one of the many little cafe tables scattered around the park, it now hosts dozens of interesting events every week. As I walk by the park each morning, I often see FREE yoga or tai chi classes taking place or a morning TV show hosting a concert. Each evening, there's always something going on - from FREE summer movies, concerts (from classical to jazz to rock), yoga classes, ballroom dancing, square dancing, fencing demonstrations, fly fishing classes, readings by authors & poets, pep rallies for local sports teams, juggling classes, etc. Throughout the day, the park also offers ping pong, putting, petangue, bocce ball, board & table games (including chess, Uno, Scrabble, CandyLand, Life, checkers, etc.) and many other activities. There's a stocked Reading Room for adults and also one for children. Kids also have the fabulous Carousel! All of this is in a great location near many tourist hotels. Its just a block from Times Square and not far from Grand Central Station, the Port Authority or Penn Station.\" Still HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Winter Village features an outdoor ice rink and numerous local merchants with clothing, jewelry, food and food item, and housewares just to name a few. It really puts you in the holiday spirit. When you are done shopping, a visit to the NYC library is a nice way to finish your visit to the park - the Christmas tree in the lobby is beautiful."

The shops are wonderful, and we always take away an item or two for the more difficult people on our shopping list. It can get crowded on weekends, so prepare for the holiday bustle. The food stands are great, and include some unique tastes, including wonderful soups, arepas, and Southwest favorites.

You can grab seating and put up your feet or just grab a piece of land and relax in the grass. During the Jewish holiday, Bryant Park provides a Sukkah for the observant to eat in. Whatta city!"

In some ways it was handy for me to try to get a head start on my holiday shopping.I walked around the complex and was delighted to find the carousel I read so much about. Carousels have always fascinated me since I was a child and this one proves to be no exception.They do have a map of the vendors showing rink and shop hours and lots of other helpful information. It encompasses two large blocks and they have eateries throughout. It is a lot easier to get around than Central Park."

It was so much fun to check out all of the Artisans and their wares.

So we relaxed and people-watched for a little bit before making our move.Over coffee and hot chocolate, we chatted with some locals who gave us a little history of the place. We loved the Reading Room with the mini-library, and got to watch some people all bundled up playing chess in that cold.The nicest and cleanest public bathrooms here were a welcome surprise. The rotating seat covers were really a plus.This is a very cool place to chill. We came in the daytime this time, so we noticed the fences and huge trees surrounding the Park.

Located behind the NY Public Library, it has lots of benches and even WiFi to help you relax. Starting in November, the Christmas Shops and ice skating rink open for business. The food is also great.TIP: On the North side of the park on 42nd St is an award winning public bathroom. It looks like any other small green building, but take another look."

Some fantastic food stalls, with the best hot chocolate with huge marshmallows. A must see!"

Before you go into the park area, stop and pay respects to Patience and Fortitude (South and North respectively) the stoic guardians of the Library...I'm referring of course to the famous Lions sitting there through all seasons for decades. During the Christmas holidays the park comes alive with skaters and a \"Christmas Village\" filled with make shift stores with all sorts of goodies; clothing, jewelry, food etc. You will definitely get into the holiday spirit watching children and adults alike skating around the ice set up for the holidays. You can rent skates and there is also a restaurant right there but I would tell you go from booth to booth and sample what's there instead. A great tree is there beautifully decorated and waiting for you to pose in front of it for a picture...See you there this coming!!!"

It was at night back in August, and it offered calmness amidst the brouhaha of New York City. Lots of couples were there and enjoying their night out.During my second trip, I went during the day (since it was so close to the hotel I stayed in). An event was built right in the middle of Bryant Park and along 6th avenue. There was an ice-skating rink with small stands all around it, selling great food, clothes and gadgets. It was a pretty cold morning, but lots of people were there. It was very peaceful and I enjoyed it tremendously. Hadn't I had a flight to catch, I could've spent my entire day there.If you happen to pass by Bryant Park, pause for a while and enjoy the moment whether alone, with your partner or friends."

Seriously. the ladies with the lotion and moisturizers wouldn't let me leave and kept lowering the prices down fron 200.00 to 100.00 and no taxes, I just had to be rude and say I have to go, so sorry. Other than that the hot thick chocolate drinks are good but you can't drink the whole cup because you could actually feel sick bc its so sweet and the thickness of the chocolate is just too much for someone my age. Other than that enjoy the view and the park on a sunny day or night."

A couple of people here and there but everyone was relaxed, sitting with friends on the grass or just watching the world go by. My second visit was on a weekday lunchtime and the place was totally different - very busy (there are several cafes to grab lunch and a decent coffee) but we were still able to find a table among the trees. A wonderfully alive atmosphere. We noticed a woman next to us was crying - a cop gave her a flower from the park. You don't see that everyday. There is also a \"reading room\" - a group of tables with quiet signs and plenty of bookshelves for those who would like to read and relax in the park. If you are in the area you MUST visit the public restroom here - it's beautiful and pristine! I think Bryant Park is my spiritual home."

The Park is the drop off and pick up spot for many bus companies. Bryant Park in December is decorated for the holidays. Including a big decorated Christmas tree and ice skating. There are little kiosks set up all over the park with people selling just about everything. Prices are reasonable on items. You can also find food and drinks in the park.When I went to the park in Summer it was to see Broadway in the Park. We took the Metro train out of Poughkeepsie which takes you to Grand Central Station. We walked to the park from there. Which is not very far. We got to enjoy different songs performed from Broadway shows by the original casts. They hold Broadway in Bryant Park on Thursdays and the best part is it's free!!"

The services offered in this relatively small space are phenomenal. We ate takeaway breakfast and lunch here, enjoyed the live piano music, watching a children's chess tournament and simple peaceful surroundings in an otherwise busy area. There's something for everyone here, free activities, entertainment, a carousel, caf\u00e9s, a lovely restaurant and plenty of tables and chairs. It's a beautiful space."

Always seem to be something happening. Give Bryant park a visit and enjoy a glass of wine."

Hard to believe that thirty years ago it was run-down and crime-ridden, and the transformation to the lovely public space of today is remarkable. This park boasts so many amenities and charms, and organizes so many programs I cannot list them all here. They have great and varied food options, excellent craft beers at their Southwest Porch bar near 40th St., and what must be the most opulent public bathrooms I've ever seen. They sit in BP's northeast corner and are themselves a great reason to visit. But with BP so many reasons exist. It is truly one of NYC's crown jewels."

It's green, enough trees to provide shade in the hot summer, a magazine and newspaper stand which provides free reading materials. a big grass field to pick nick, read or just relax or meditate. Awesome in a nutshell. Positioned on the corner of 6th Avenue and 42nd Street it is a great starting point for the day and also a greatplace to watch the NYPD snake that runs along side the park once a day (10's, 20'2 or more squad cars driving by with flashlights and sirens)"

Besides just being a great place to chat with friends and people watch over a coffee, soft drink or cocktail at one of the many little cafe tables scattered around the park, it now hosts dozens of interesting events every week. As I walk by the park each morning, I often see FREE yoga or tai chi classes taking place or a morning TV show hosting a concert. Each evening, there's always something going on - from FREE summer movies, concerts (from classical to jazz to rock), yoga classes, ballroom dancing, square dancing, fencing demonstrations, fly fishing classes, readings by authors & poets, pep rallies for local sports teams, juggling classes, etc. Throughout the day, the park also offers ping pong, putting, petangue, bocce ball, board & table games (including chess, Uno, Scrabble, CandyLand, Life, checkers, etc.) and many other activities. There's a stocked Reading Room for adults and also one for children. Kids also have the fabulous Carousel! All of this is in a great location near many tourist hotels. Its just a block from Times Square and not far from Grand Central Station, the Port Authority or Penn Station. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

During the summer, you can catch a movie in the park or witness a friendly game of bocce. During the winter, you and try you hand at double axles around the ice rink. During the winter, you can find that gift for that special someone in one of the many colorful holiday booths.

But my favorite memory is from last Christmas, when the holiday fair set up shop in rows of tiny kiosks and the snow was falling, and people were laughing. So reminiscent of the good part of New York, too. Look for the lending library, pull up a chair, read a book and drink your coffee. Even a work day can have a little Paris added."

We appreciated the Game corner in the park where there are different kind of board games of which people can borrow and play. My boy came there almost every day after summer class to play chess with the New Yorkers there. According to Gregory, the game stall staff, people have been visiting and playing chess for many many years. The good thing about playing chess here is that it doesn't cost you a penny. Some places in NYC may need you to pay or people may gamble.I must thank Gregory here as he spent a few days with my boy and taught him a lot! My heartful thanks Man!The Cons about this park is the bathroom. I think it is too small. For men it's all right. For ladies, there is always a line of 15-20 people. It broke once during our stay and the men's bathroom then turned to be a unisex one with along queue outside."

This privately-managed public park hosts the main building here, that is must-a-see, the New York Public Library. Though, the principal entrance is from Sixth Ave. on the west. There are a lot of benches and seats, that are within this longest expanse of the grass in Manhattan, south of the Central Park. We decided to take some time to repose our legs after long walk along the streets and avenues in the Midtown, and that was the perfect place for such thing. Not only serves this park as \"the lunchroom\"\" for midtown office workers but it is a spot of the seating area for major events,that take place here in the center of New York. One of the happenings is for sure the HBO/Bryant Park Summer Film Festival. Also there is Citi Pond skating rink, used by the New Yorkers in the winter time. So as You see, the fun is not only in the Central Park or Rockefeller Plaza but also here in Bryant Park, amidst the busyness of the institutions around it.Really wonderful !"

The park is small and worth a visit. The best thing is the park is right next to the NY Public Library which is a must see! Plan on visiting the Library for a least 2 hours than go back to visit the park."

But if I had....Anyway, as a landscape architect, I have seen a lot of parks and am fascinated with how they work, or not. And this one is the best I've ever experienced. I went every day during my stay in a nearby hotel. I went at different times of day, for breakfast, during the week and on the weekend. It was always fabulous. It's always busy, yet never crowded. There was a full programme of exercise, religious and musical events, which were clearly regular and free to partake in or enjoy watching New Yorkers at play....or at work (business meetings) or at study (students) or kids (quaintest carousel). The kiosks are not rip-off prices. The toilets are clean. There is sunshine, or shade. It didn't used to be like this. I knew this. You should find out what it was like before, before you go, and then you will surely appreciate it even more. But even if you're not consumed by park facts like me, you'll love it. Sit on one of the infamous green folding chairs and watch New York. Everyday."

Kudos to the city and those who manage the park for doing such a great job. As a resident of Baltimore, visiting Bryant Park always reminds me that yes, you can make changes.If you are under 40, it would be pretty easy to dismiss how lovely this park is. You only have to remember visiting the city in the late 70s or so to be stunned at the difference. I ALWAYS feel safe in the park now, and make sure to visit it every time I am in the city. It brings a sense of peace, calm, and a reminder of how people from all walks of life can get along just fine.Each season brings its own brand of magic - ice skating in the winter, Shakespeare this summer, chess games, juggling lessons. The lovely little carousel. In the 70s or 80s you would dread to ever use a public bathroom in the city. In 2011 the bathrooms at Bryant Park were voted best in the world by a travel website. I can tell you my surprise when I used one - spotlessly clean and even had fresh flowers. Wonderful!So, if you are at nearby Times Square or seeing a show, do yourself a favor and walk a few blocks over just to sit and enjoy Bryant Park. It is a little gem."

For those that can have lunch here and can't make it to Central Park I guess it would be nice but it was really crowded when we were there so not really much peacefulness. Central Park is gigantic by comparison.For what it is Bryant Park is a nice little urban park, but the crowds and people trying to sell stuff take away from the peacefulness.

As we wandered here by accident on thanksgiving we found loads of great offers and their prices had been reduced. If you are going to go then that is definitely the time to do it.Had a lovely wander round and there were plenty food stalls to for the hungry the crepes were lovely.A nice way to spend an afternoon."

It's like a small paradise in the heart of New York, situated next to the New York Public Library. It's a small but very nice place that offers different kind of activities during the day from yoga to juggling or even thai chi. In summer the HBO Summer Film Festival take place as well here , an event that we had to miss sadly because it starts just in the middle of June.But even like this, it's the perfect place to chill out with the friends in a warm afternoon or just to read alone under the trees.Oh and something else: free wifi!! ;)"

There are so many options on offer: people watching, watching performances, eating and drinking at the sandwich bars or the cafe, putting golf course, bocce, children's carousel. Park staff are lovely. I loved the 'library' in the park with designated seating area and free books, magazines and newspapers to read. This park is perfection."

Situated behind the NY Public Library the park turns into a winter wonderland during the holiday season. Ice skating is free, however; you must pay to rent skates if you don't have any with you.They have a beautiful Christmas tree and a nice holiday market skirting through and around the perimeter of it. You can find affordable gifts and souvenirs for that special someone on your list. There's also food vendors there along with hot chocolate, hot cider, coffee, or whatever else you desire to keep warm.It is located on 42nd St which is a quick walk over to Times Squares and other midtown destinations. It is a nice place to \"get away from it all\" when you need to take a break."

Games are set up for people to play in the shade - chess etc, newspapers and magazines are available in a reading section and a BBQ was being set up on our last morning following a very wet night. The height of the tulips was impressive and beautiful! Location is perfect, right behind the library. Definitely worth a visit."

Now it is a delightful park space, with a book lending area, summer events, a Christmas ice skating rink and craft booths. To sit and read, or have a bit of lunch is a delight. There are some good restaurants nearby, it is directly behind the main branch of the NYPL, and a few blocks from both Times Square and Lord and Taylor. A nice walk from Macy's in Herald Square. A really delightful spot. And a good subway hub."

Ask a native New Yorker for the names of the big Lions in front of the Main Public Library on Fifth & 42nd and you would most probably get a surprised look: they don\u2019t know. But that does not stop Patience and Fortitude to stand majestically at the entrance of the library and observe the reading public around. In their backyard, on the back of the Library building, you will find Bryant Park, a place with long and quaint history. It started as a Potter\u2019s field, served as Union Troupes barracks during the Civil War, then became Reservoir park, adjacent to the Huge Croton Reservoir which was built to bring fresh water to the City and once resided at the place of the current library. The park nowadays is pleasant, even if small. Movies at night in the summer, ice skating ring in the middle in winter, free chairs you can move around to sit whenever you please and interesting architectural buildings around. But I like most spring and fall: if you get tired just sitting and reading, you can move to the Bryant Park Caf\u00e9, where the food is interesting and sensibly priced, service is prompt but not pushy and the Prosecco chilled. Try the Gazpacho, served with fresh cucumbers and chopped mint. If you are interested in more formal dining, go to the Bryan Park Grill. Then stroll around and take pictures of the kids riding the Carousel on the background of French street melodies. And don\u2019t forget to look at the stunning black and gold building that the American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Company commissioned in 1924 (now Bryant park Hotel). Enjoy!"

There are several ice rinks to choose from in NYC: Rockefeller Plaza (crowded, touristy); Lasker (small, crowded, dirty locker room), Wollman (spacious rink used by natives and tourists alike, $), Riverbank State Park (good skating, but way uptown), and Bryant Park (free if you have skates, $15 if you don't). Located in the shadow of the historic Main Library, Bryant Park rink is clean, well-tended, and a one-two punch to hit the rink and library (if you have kids, visit the renovated children's library, complete with stuffed animals and scheduled readings). All skating rinks have terrible food, so venture elsewhere if you want to nosh (NY for snack). The best part was the music, which was retro (Sinatra, Fats Waller, Ella Fitzgerald, Rosemary Clooney), which gave the experience an old New York feel. If you squinted away the Conde Nast building, you could pretend it was the Jazz Era, when New York Clubs reigned and the M&M store was just a twinkle in Time Square's eye."

I have traveled all over the world and Bryant Park makes me truly appreciate the concept of public space and public parks. You will not find anything like this anywhere in Europe or Asia for sure. A FREE lovely oasis in the center of Manhattan where you can sit down and rejuvenate.Bryant Park has a free wifi zone, free yoga & tai chi classes during warm months, outdoor movies at night, concerts, and tables and chairs for anyone to use. Before the holidays, from Nov through the first week in Jan the park is taken over by small holiday boutique shops selling items that are supposed to be handmade or imported from afar and not generally available in chain stores. Some of it is very high end and I applaud the vendors who sit in those booths during the cold weather. It is beautifully set up and magical. \"The Pond\" skating rink is free if you bring your own skates, and rentals and lockers are available for a fee. They open early in the morning, and it's not usually crowded at that time.If you are visiting with a family and want to get tickets on the Two-fer line at Times Square, this is a great place for someone to hang out with the kids while a few folks wait in the ticket line. The \"Witch-craft\" sandwich shops are slightly overpriced but decent fare. Surrounding the park are some deli's and food vendors. And did I mention a little carousel for kids?When my neice & nephew came to visit, we waited in line for the Empire State Bldg a long time, and then came here for bagels while my sister-in-law went to get theater tickets. The kids enjoyed running around on the grassy lawn, while I laid down and stretched my back after having been on my feet all morning. The garden beds are well kept, and the fountain plaza makes a perfect setting for tea/scones. Many people come here at lunchtime, as there is both sun on the lawn, and shade under the trees.The Public Library has an outdoor reading room with umbrellas, newspapers and books, including childrens books and small tables, story hour and writing workshops for adults all free of charge.And perhaps the BEST KEPT SECRET about Bryant Park is their opulent public bathroom located right on 42nd Street near the side entrance to the library. It has an attendant, and stunning floral arrangement between the marble sinks.Check their website for a calendar of events."

The plus is its free if you have your own skates. The downside is that if you do rent the skates for $15 they are terrible...plastic skates! You still have to wait in line to get an arm band. There is space to hangout inside the rental area where its heated and has lots of windows to watch the skaters. The non skaters in our group opted to go to the Celsius bar instead. There are free lockers available but you have to rent a lock. We just left the shoes in the lockers without a lock.We went around 7pm so its was beautiful to see NY all lit up. It was crowded but my 6 year old had no problem navigating through the crowds while he penguin skated his way around the rink."

There is a fun bar along the Library side as well as a very good restaurant. Towards the 6th Avenue side, you can find coffee and snacks. Plenty of cafe tables and chairs are available but on a nice day you'll be well advised to grab one on the early side. During the summer months, movies are shown for a gourmet picnic crowd. In the winter months, vendors set up a gift fair and an ice rink is a popular stop. If you are in the midtown area, don't miss this."

The first time I was exposed or saw it was when I went down on a bus trip last year(2013) You literally wait for the bus to pick you up right in front of Bryant Park. Inside the park are plenty of benches if you want to sit and relax. There are food and drink vendors. When I went this December 2013 there were shops set up underneath these tent like structures selling all kinds of goods right before Christmas. I dont know if they do this every year at Christmas; I was there in the summer of 2013 and they were not set up at that time. There are people playing chess and other games and Im told that you can join in the games if your up for the challenge. There was a beautifully lit tree with pretty blue lights dazzling the evening sky. There was an ice skating rink set up as well as what looked like a building to warm up or rent your ice skates from. The surrounding bldgs were lit up as well making it a very warm, chrismas feel. In the summer theres plenty of flowers to look at and they do a wonderful job of landscaping this park. There are people playing different instruments, we seen a big screen set up and people in the park with their lawn chairs watching a movie...there always seems to be something really cool going on at the park. We really enjoy stopping at this park as part of our NYC experience. P.S.....The park has a very small set up stairs to climb and then its all flat. Easy access. But the best part is that it feels private even though its in the heart of the city."

Our hotel is about a block from Bryant Park . . . we stayed in a different hotel adjacent to Bryant Park a few summers ago and very much enjoy the area. This was our first holiday-time visit to Manhattan and we cannot wait to return. Bryant Park's holiday market, skating rink, and Christmas tree . . . officially referred to as \"Winter Village at Bryant Park\" is a must-do activity. The seasonal market includes \"more than 125 boutique-style shops\". Food, jewelry, handcrafts, clothes, skin care products . . . all the items you would expect from a first-class holiday market. My wife shopped while I skated. Well, \"skated\" may be an exaggeration! Gridlock crowds everywhere . . . on the ice, in the market, throughout Manhattan! Neither of us is particularly attracted to crowds, though everyone was cordial and everyone seemed to enjoy the festivities.With very rare exception, every one of our activities during our week\u2019s stay in NYC was fabulous; and of all those fabulous activities, the Winter Village at Bryant Park was the best!By the way, bring your own skates and admission is free. The Rockefeller Center rink is much, much smaller and charges $27 for adults. Rent skates and it\u2019s a total of $39 at Rock Center and $19 at Bryant Park."

This is not your local 'craft market' but rather offering somewhat average-to-upscale gifts, jewelry, gloves, hats, scarves, socks, wallets, and toys, in addition to food and beverage offerings such as hot chocolate, warm Belgium-style waffles with strawberries or bananas, delicious pastel macaroons, fudge, hot cider or coffees. Always festive, there's a beautifully-decorated giant Christmas tree adjacent to the ever-busy ice skating rink, and plenty of seating nearby for people-watching. Don't be surprised if you are asked to take a picture for someone in front of the big tree, and remember to offer the same for them!Note that within the limits of the park, is the cleanest (and attended) restroom in New York City, complete with a vase of flowers at the entrance and rotating automatic toilet-seat covers!

There were lots of people on the ice already when we arrived at around 10.30am. The line to get in and the boot hire was quite quick and the service was excellent. We asked for the lace up boots that are better quality than the blue plastic alternatives on offer. There were people grabbing on to the sides, some gliding very slowly around the rink and a few select people with more of a grasp doing ice dancing movements (not me). The best thing was it was warmer on the ice. The sun was shining on the rink. It was the warmest I felt for the rest of the day. A very special Christmas Day experience. Highly recommended."

My brother and I went ice skating at the ice rink. We had to wait in line for a few minutes to pay and get our skates, but once we got on the ice it was great. Not too crowded and no wait. The whole atmosphere of the park is amazing, Christmastime or not."

It is a beautiful park in the heart of NYC right behind the New York Public Library. Now during Christmas season is a great time to stop by this park as the Winter Village has been set up and there are many shops set up in the park as well as a skating rink. Obviously if you come during the popular times such as a weekend you will have to wait on line to ice skating, but I think that the wait times are much better than the rink at Rockefeller center."

            "review": "no more needle park?. I'm old enough to remember when Bryant Park was known as Needle Park & was full of junkies, drug dealers & other asst crime in the NYC Bad Old Days. By around 1990 it became so bad that the park was closed for several years for a complete makeover. Overgrown bushes & hidden walkways were replaced by a large lawn surrounded by benches, tables, & chairs for midtown office workers to eat lunch & hang out in warmer weather. Bryant Park is behind the main branch buildings of the NY Public Library, & the Midtown Branch is right across the street, so many of the library visitors use the park now too. NY Fashion Week has shows in Bryant Park, & there are many other events, including outdoor film screenings in summer & a Holiday Gift Market every year from Black Friday - New Years Day. Last year, about 50 sheep grazed in a large pen in Bryant Park to celebrate, yes, Ntl Wool Week, & there's a Bocci Ball Court that's always crowded. Bryant Park has been totally gentrified & mainstreamed, but there still seems to be a bit of the old Needle Park vibe remaining. There was a shooting there last month (over the attempted theft of someone's coat), & lately there are more & more pickpocketing complaints during the summer film screenings. The free WiFi is widely publicized, but the signal is always weak & often nonexistent. Even as a lifelong Nu Yawka & a big fan of our local parks, I've never been able to warm up to this one, & the spiffy, wholesome Bryant Park doesn't really appeal to me any more than the seedy old Needle Park. There are so many wonderful parks in NYC ... my advice to out-of-towners would be to visit the other ones instead of Bryant Park. By the way, check out the 1971 movie \"Panic in Needle Park\" starring a young Al Pacino in one of his first leading roles."

In the middle of the park is a ice skating rink fronted by a big Christmas Tree. Surrounding the rink is the Bryant Park Christmas vendors, with everything from designer hot chocolate ($5 a cup but yummy on a cold day) to designer clothes. If you have never been to NYC during the holidays, these holiday markets are located throughout the city at some parks, Columbus Circle at Central Park, Union Square, Washington Square, and Bryant Park are some of the more central locations. We like Bryant Park because it is so near to many of the main tourist attractions, such as Times Square, Grand Central Station (which has an upscale holiday market indoors) Rockefeller Center and the shops on 5th Ave. A good NYC experience for the holidays."

I had a wonderful time looking at beautiful art work, ornaments, hats, scarves and jewelry. Food vendors were varied and plentiful, the decorations gorgeous and the ice skating rink looked like a lot of fun. Most of the days I spent were fairly warm and the heaters in the shops were effective except for yesterday, during a blowing snow storm. Despite the cold, vendors remained very helpful and cheery and were not too pushy. Of course most items were a bit pricy (it's NY after all!) but you can find wonderful items in your budget if you look--and some vendors are negotiable.

The ice skating rink with bright lights and couples holding hands, families enjoying eachother, friends hanging out. If you are not up for skating, there's the #wintervillage which consists of 100+ shops of knick knacks and gourmet foods. There's also a massive Christmas tree that makes for a great backdrop in pictures. Additionally, the Empire State Building is nearby and you can catch a glimpse. It happened to be bright blue last night, but changes colors often.My roommates and I came to the skating rink here last night after work and had a blast! I was always intimidated to skate here because it's usually SO packed, but it wasn't last night. Maybe because it snowed earlier in the day, or it was a random Tuesday. Whatever the reason, it made for a nice night. I'm really glad NYC has some activities with free admission. You just have to pay for skates and bag check. Luckily, I have my own pair so I just paid for bag check."

The skating rink is great and not very crowded. The Christmas Tree was lit and as beautiful as ever. We took our traditional picture under the tree. There were about the same amount of vendors this year as last. Most vendors are pleasant to deal with. Grab a drink and sit in the middle of the park where they have nice chairs and heaters, or grab a snack at one of the vendors. There is something for everyone. For me, the serenity of the park, amidst the hustle and bustle of the city is priceless. A must see for anyone."

We looked over at Bryant Park and saw shops set up for Christmas and heard music. The were having their Christmas Tree lighting event. There was music galore and the numerous shops were a delight to visit. We sat down and watched the skaters for over an hour. Young, old, couples, singles, men, women all forgot their problems for a while and were enjoying the ice. Some were very talented, while others were still learning. A great visit during the holiday season. Take time if you are in NYC during the Christmas holiday to visit this site."

Bryant Park takes the bustle out of New York and really places you into an intimate, cozy, and warm setting. Winter Fair is a vacation on vacation in the heart of the city.Multiple vendor booths make walking around quite fun, encountering new finds and interesting things to purchase.Take the time out of your day to decompress and relax. Enjoy a skate (cheaper and FAR LESS busy than the sometimes insane rink at Rockerfeller).Sure, you may not have that magical \"Rockerfeller\" experience, but being surround by lights, lovely people, and a great view of the lit-up Empire State Building make Bryant Park a must-see, particularly at this magical time of year."

The ice ring seats on the middle of Bryant Park, limited by small charming shops and surround by the tall New York buildings.If you plan to do same ice skating in NY, this is the spot. On the other and, if you are an experienced ice skater, you may find the ring too crowded.The skates rental fee was 14$ in Dec2012"

In the summer, you can have coffee and a snack at a table while people watching and listening to the heartbeat of the city. In the evenings, if you're lucky, you can check the activity schedule and catch a movie on the lawn if you get there in time to grab a spot. In autumn, you get to \"observe\" NY Fashion Week. Unless you're an insider of course, receive an invite and attend a show. I always enjoy just watching the tents and seeing fashionistas come and go. In winter, you can grab a coffee and go ice skating on the ice rink. If you're too cold, you can have dinner and drinks in the restaurant at the other end, next to the NY Public Library. In NYC for a visit? You have to stop by!!"

My wife and I went to Bryant Park between 41st and 42nd streets off 5th Avenue during a recent trip to New York City. The park was set up with a series of booths selling crafts items and food. In the center there was an open ice skating rink. We had fun strolling up and down the aisles and popping into booths that looked interesting. Strolling is appropriate because of the crowds of other people doing the same thing. In addition to the crafts artwork and clothing there were a number of booths selling ethnic foods of various kinds. We did not participate in the ice skating which was crowded as well. The area is family friendly though I would not recommend trying to navigate a stroller through the narrow aisles."

They were setting up for winter with the installation of the ice rink, and what looked like booths for vendors. There are spots to order food and drinks, and also a little carousel.

I had seen it marked on the map but did not imagine it would be such a pleasing and peaceful green space. Such a delightful place to sit and and while away some time midst the craziness of the city. Some fine dining available close by, and a delightful round-a-bout for small children to ride, or should it be called a Carousel here? I'm not sure. Close to the library so a place to come and read your book, or an ideal site for city workers to bring their sandwiches and just chill out for an hour. Such a delightful space."

Such a fun time after lunch at the Bryant Park Grill. Our friends were unaware of the shops and delighted by this 'new' experience. These local New Yorkers met us for lunch and then discovered the shops and chocolates and just about anything you might need or not...but definitely fun.Bryant Park is transformed during the holidays into this winter wonderland of shopping, having lunch and relaxing with friends. Just blocks from Macy's, Herald Square and the Chrysler Building, this park is the perfect place to relax - summer or winter. Great photos of the Chrysler Building, and my friends, and husband, still indulge my photographing of the glass, steel, skyscrapers surrounging this beautiful, quaint park - the juxtaposition of these buildings adjacent to this serene, peaceful park is captivating."

No cards required, just sign the books in and out. In the 1940s it closed with the onslaught of jobs. It has reopened in 2003 with the same idea has back in 1935. There are plenty of tables and chairs to sit and relax, perhaps read a book or work on your laptop. Probably for some office people nearby bring their lunch and enjoy the sunny day.There are 14 animals to pick for a ride on Le Carousel plus listen to French cabaret music.

Situated in the hear of Midtown between 5th Avenue and 6th Avenue, just behind the NY Public Library, this is the place to go. A quiet spot, where you can have free language, yoga classes. You can also listen live music or watch outdoor movies in summer time, read free books and newspapers, watch broadway show in the park... All the world pass by the park. On the evening from 5pm to 7pm the bar are full and you can meet people from all over the world. All the buildings around are amazing like the Empire State Building or the Bank of America Tower.If you come to NYC you definitely have to come to Bryant Park and enjoy its wonderful atmosphere !"

The park itself has many interesting features including a carousel, fountain, games, the NY public library, reading area, and endless people watching. During the summer, they show movies on the lawn on a giant screen. During the winter, the lawn is replaced by an ice rink and cute shops. Quintessential New York."

The bordering gardens are always well maintained. Plenty of seating around and the grassy area is great for throwing down a blanket and chilling with the kindle or people watching. The grill is great for a brunch and a quick bite, not cheap, but a nice treat. The little bar on the southeast corner is a regular stop in the evening. Also, one of the nicest public bathroom there is in the city, fresh flowers and beautiful tile work. I'm only in Manhattan a few times a year but this park is always on my list. Great hotels and restaurants close by and subway stops for nearly every train it seems!"

            "review": "A real disappointment as a public park. Bryant Park is located in midtown Manhattan, where millions of people live and work. For many of them, me included, its lawn is the only public green space that's easily accessible for quite a distance in any direction. And the park is beautifully appointed so you'd think this would be a magical place for those park-starved locals, as well as tourists visiting midtown. But you'd be wrong.The problem? The lawn is virtually never open. The park is public but \"privately managed,\" and the management company is constantly leasing out the lawn to corporate sponsors, who do stunts on the lawn for publicity purposes. While these \"events\" might satisfy the boredom of some, they close the lawn for long periods of time, depriving the public of its primary purpose -- quiet enjoyment of a green space.For instance, during the summer, there is a movie shown every monday night. The lawn is invaded by yuppies who cram in -- the entire lawn is packed. What this means for the average park goer is the lawn is closed all day Monday, and then it's \"rested\" from the event, so that it's also closed all day Tuesday. So, in other words, it's closed 40% of weekdays, ALL SUMMER. For what? A Yuppie-pleasing event?Similar stunts are done now in the early Fall, with a \"square dance\" held on three occasions in September, each of which similarly closes the lawn for two (or more) days each. What you will often see if you arrive at this park is confused and disappointed tourists being unceremoniously booted off the lawn to close it to prepare for the latest event. Honestly the lawn seems to be closed more often than it's open. In fall, usually when the weather is still nice, an ice rink is planted on the lawn -- a nice idea for winter, but do we really need an ice rink in late October? Brought to you by Citibank, of course.Bryant Park is the public green space that isn't really one. Until the management company starts thinking more about the public and less about corporate sponsors, BP rates no more than one star. It's a tragedy for the green space-starved locals who need to sit or lay on green grass now and then."

I sat drinking an ice tea, in the shade of some lovely big trees, while watching some fotness followers working out to music at the far end of the park (its not that big).Well worth stopping by for a coffee, or a refreshment, or even just some fresh air in the city, and some greenery!

Loads of attractive tables and chairs, a reading area complete with books, a cafeteria and different attractions: we planned to go there the following Monday evening for the open-air cinema, but New York offers so many distractions that we forgot about it. Maybe next time."

For a city centre park this is a lovely spot to have a rest after a long day exploring the City and the sights. The large expanse of grass in the evening is under spotlight from one of the large skyscrapers surrounding it. The Bryant Park cafe is also worth a visit. We had our evening meal sat outside under the trees. The food and the service was excellent. We had a chicken caesar salad and crab cakes. To drink we had Huckleberry Lemonade which was a vodka cocktail. Delicious!! I would hightly recommend this cafe."

If you are hungry, you can get sandwiches from the stands, or any of the eateries surrounding the park. If you check the website before, you will see which activities are happening that day: Fencing, yoga classes, movie night on the lawn... are just a few free activities that are offered. I like to sit with my laptop and do work whenever I have a couple of extra minutes in the city. There are many outlets hidden in green boxes next to the table. The only problem is that I had trouble getting wifi lately, although it could be problem with my computer.OH! and the bathrooms are VERY CLEAN"

There were a wide range of free well known games - Scrabble, Ludo, Dominoes, etc as well as games we'd never heard of but made up our own rules for. There is a volunteer with the games if you need help. There are also other free games like table tennis, a viking game for two, and a golf putting hole. The games finish at 7pm.There are lots of places to sit to bring your own picnic / refreshments. A grass are for running around. An outdoor selection of books from the library next door, a beautiful Victorian style free toilet (expect to queue), free language classes, and a Horse Carousel for $2. There is a bar / cafe on site. There is also an ice cream van near the toilets.My son loved this and he was very keen to return. Highly recommended for families and couples, friends and people on their own. There are leaflet stands near the entrances to see what various events that go on in the park, music events, films, talks, etc."

There\u2019s usually something going on. How about turning up and seeing knights on horseback jousting with each other? That\u2019s Bryant Park.

Beautiful grass that nobody stepped on, people sitting at the little open library that provides free books and comfy seats to people on their lunch break or little children with their families or nannies, who could also enjoy the beautiful carousel, people juggling, playing table tennis and boules or learning a new language. There is something for everyone to be found and it was the moment my husband and I fell completely in love with NYC & the USA."

The NYC library backs onto it and provides a stunning backdrop to this majestic park. The grassed lawn always green in the milder months and the wonderful \"halo\" of trees surrounding the park make this place a magical place to sit and have lunch or a drink."

Available sit-down restaurants include Bryant Park Grill, Cafe, and Southwest Porch. If you're not in the mood to eat, bring a blanket and soak up the sun on the spacious green lawn. The juxtaposition of nature and architecture (see Grace Building, NYC Library, and Bryant Park hotel) makes the park a true New York treasure. Visitors can also visit the park in the winter when it is transformed into a seasonal skating rink in The Pond, with its own restaurant and snack bar. The atmosphere is eloquent & charming- quite a good idea for a brisk December night."

Indeed it's hard to believe you're not in Paris & a recent sunny spring day at the transformed park with its tubs of tulips & pansies was enchanting. Underneath the pale green trees & seated at little round tables with metal bistro chairs surrounding the glorious fountain & lush fresh grass, visitors from all over the world enjoyed the vibrant scene, while eating interesting sandwiches (pole tuna, chopped chick peas, goat cheese with avocado, etc.) from 'Wich Craft kiosk at the northwest corner of the park or one of the many delis & restaurants surrounding it. For a more leisurely experience, sit for a while with a drink on a swinging bench at the bar at the southwest corner. At the southeast corner an old-fashioned carousel adds to the charm & nearby a cart full of books is a lending library for children - how thoughtful! At another jugglers invite observers to try their skills, while across the park, French/Italian/Spanish/Japanese language lessons are offered during the lunch hour. Seated beneath Jo Davidson's famous statue of Gertrude Stein - not far from the looming statue of William Cullen Bryant for whom the park, nestled behind the majestic public library (another must-see) was named, I was transported to Paris, while listening to a piano concert, performed every weekday lunch hour by professional musicians."

Due to the hedges or what was left of them, you actually didn't want to walk on the sidewalk outside the park much less go in! Now, the park is a different world entirely, thankfully so. You can just relax on the grass or just sit in one of the many chairs. You can play ping pong, take the kids for a carousel ride, ice skate in Winter or watch movies under the stars one night a week in Summer. No chairs are allowed on the grass but you may bring a blanket to sit on. There are vendors inside and outside the park as well as restaurants all around ( even on the park grounds) The land the park sits on is filled with history, as is most of Manhattan. Once a potters field, also a revolutionary war battlefield as well as a onetime reservoir for the City. You'll be fascinated to know that when standing in Brant park, you are standing atop storage for millions of research books! They are sent back and forth to the NYC library just to the East via a conveyor system. You must visit the Library too.."

The Park has 100\u2019s of green chairs to sit in and relax and watch all the people go by. It is also a great place to rest, relax and have a soda if you are on a long walking tour of NYC. Also, if you like Ping Pong you are in luck as there is a table on the North end of the park that anyone can use. There is a small carousel for the little ones but there was only one kid on it due to the chilly weather.If you are in Midtown and are looking for a place to relax for a few minutes, I recommend checking out Bryant Park."

We went on a Monday night I hopes that there wouldn't be a huge crowd, which of course there was but the rink didn't feel over crowded other than the long line to get in and crowding in the seating areas. Skate rental and rink fee was reasonable, i think it was something along the lines of $12-16 per person. There was a bag check- either you or they would supply the bag- and lockers available for rent. There's a small concession stand, which was over priced--like everything in NYC but not too bad. Unfortunately we were there the day before they lit the Christmas tree---apparently it's the Tuesday after Thanksgiving--- but all the lights and music made it magical just the same. All around the staff were great, there were staff on the ice helping those who fell get back up. Definitely would come back."

For those who want to go ice skating in New York City for whom the cramped rinks at Rockefeller Center and in Central Park do not appeal, Bryant Park puts up a sizable rink during the Christmas holidays, I believe just from around Thanksgiving to the end of January. Couple that with the shops that surround the rink for holiday shopping, and you can have a good deal of fun at the park for a wintery evening.At the other end of the seasonal spectrum, on Monday nights over the summer there are free movies - bring your own lawn chair, or if you arrive early, you may be able to grab one of park's own metal chairs in a prime viewing spot.In between, there is the lovely huge lawn in the center of the park that makes sitting on a chair after work and staring at the green a fantastic way to decompress and prepare for a fun evening in New York City!Incidentally, Bryant Park for a time hosted the NY Fashion Week, which meant that the center 2/3 of the park was off-limits"

The ice-skating is free, if you bring your own skates. The location of this park puts it in the middle of every tourists path - walking distance from Times Square, a stone's throw from Grand Central Station and just adjoining the New York Library building. The park is small and does tend to feel crowded. Its definitely worth a stop to rest your tired feet and indulge in some ice-skating or some people watching, but not worth a special visit!"

Not as expensive as the Rockerfeller as you only pay for skate hire here (my daughter brought her own skates), and more conveniently placed in the city than the one in Central Park (unless you are staying at the posh end of town!!)."

The atmosphere was brilliant both day and night. There is a lovely outside bar that has heaters all round the seating areas and a fire pit to keep you warm, there is an inside bar called Celsius which also serves food and we highly recommend the beautiful more formal restaurant called The Grill. We ate here one evening and had a wonderful meal in almost magical surroundings with the Fairy lights through the trees and the skating rink all lit up. There was even a wedding party on the ice in all their wedding outfits.

            "review": "great experience during the holiday season!. Bryant park is vibrant and jam packed with tourists and locals of the neighbouring boroughs alike. if you are visiting between Xmas eve and New Years Eve Expect long line ups to get into the skate rental/ locker area. If you have a \"New York Pass\" which can be purchased online, you can speed through the line and gain entry right away. But standing in line really isnt all that bad. As you pace along in the qeue, there are small vendors selling warm food items including fresh donuts, peanuts, pretzels and such. Each vendor is in a small wooden hut type structure, personalised by some sort of art. You also get alook at the merry go round and surrounding buildings at a slowed down pace. I personally found that standing in line gave me a chance to slow down and take in the surroundings. But if your on a tight schedule and cant afford 45 mins to an hour in line, then I suggest you go with the New York pass. Skates cost 14 per pair. For some reason they are all mens skates so if you are a woman asking for your size, they just give you 2 sizes smaller in a mens skate which I found to be really tight - but they are friendly and will exchanfge sizes if you ask. You can also rent a big blue 'sac' to put your shoes and other belongings into for $5.00. if you are in a large group, rent this bag and have it put aside. It works out to be much cheaper and more convenient than a locker. Overall it\u2019s a great experience! The big great tree covered in lights, the caf\u00e9 faces the rink and is completely see in with all glass coverings. Its all lovely!"

Nestled between towering skyscrapers and busy streets is a wonderful lush garden where you can really unwind. We always make plans as soon as we arrive in New York to have lunch at the Bryant Park Grill. The food and wine are excellent, but it's being surrounded by the beauty of the trees that is so worth while in this amazing city. We're taking my mum for her 65th birthday this April and Bryant park will be our first port of call."

Located behind the NYC Public Library and in the shadows of the Chrysler building this park is an oasis in the concrete jungle. Like all parks in NYC the location changes moods depending on the time of year. Ice skating and Christmas village in winter and sunbathers and concerts in the summer. One visit is not enough. Some eateries line the edges of the parks and vendor booths are inside the park as well as an eatery in the park. The park has facilities as well as all the locations lining the park. There are tables and chairs to relax under the trees or sit in the grassy areas when weather permits. Chess is routinely played here under the trees during the warmer months. The park can also be a great place for tourists of the city to take a picnic or just make a relaxing stop during your many destinations in NYC. The park also makes an ideal meeting point as the size is not large. One of the great places in NYC."

Of course, we got there and....there was no line to skip!! :) Anyway, we paid $25 per person to skip the line, get skate rental and a rental to hold our shoes. It's a bit crowded in the area to get on your skates, but you could get a seat if you waited a minute. The ice was in pretty bad shape when we first went on, but that's expected after so many people skating on it. I was with my older kids (16 and 12) and my youngest who is 4. It can be chaotic with an inexperienced skater, but i have to admit that people were surprisingly pleasant and were watching out for the littler ones. It started snowing while we were skating, which was quite magical. They had a fun time skating and then looking around at the little shops on the perimeter of the rink. Overall, it was fun and a great alternative to Rockefeller Center. We walked up there later to see the tree and I'm glad we didn't wait in line to skate there. Go, you'll have fun!"

It's located between the 5th and the 6th avenues, close to the Times Square, but conveniently away from the crowds that usually prefer neon ads than books. In fact, Bryant Park lays over the underground library archives! The surrounding area is quite interesting. There are some shops, the amazing black and golden Bryant Park Hotel building, and, during the winter, The Citi Pond, an ice skating rink. Le Pain Quotidien just in front the park is the perfect place to the beginning of the day. The omelets are fantastic! The Bryan Park Grill, in the rear of the library, is a contemporary international restaurant open from lunch to dinner. If not cheap or unforgettable, it is tasteful enough to please you. The outdoors restrooms are terrific - they will remember you that this is a public, but private park! Don't forget to visit the Citi Pond also during the night since the views are awesome."

The prices aren't terrible, but if course you have to pay for every little thing. The wait was short and even though it was packed, it was relatively easy to move around. The only shortcomings were the quality of the skates and ice - seemed some skates were decent while others were very beat up, and the ice was tough to move around on since they have to flood it and never get it that smooth. Still, ice skating in NYC during the holidays is not a way to spend an afternoon by any means."

They said the spinach and feta was the best, but also loved the artichoke.The ice rink and giant blue Christmas tree are a perfect photo op.Bathrooms are available, but the women's line is typically long."

They are very strict about not letting you hold spots for other people, so make sure your entire party is arrives together. If you bring your own skates, it's free. If you rent them, it's $14. You will also need to pay for a locker once inside, so that you can store your shoes. They were out of lockers for our crew, so they had to pay to \"check a bag,\" which was $7 and a bag was given to them to put all of their shoes in. The ice is quite full, but our teens had a great time skating. There are plenty of Skate Guards on the ice and they keep people moving and enforce the no cell phone rule.There is a large observation deck opposite the giant blue Christmas tree. There are tables and chairs that can be moved around. There are also a lot of little shops and food places in Bryant Park, and Times Square is just a couple blocks away. Public bathrooms are located in the park close to the library, but the women's line is always long (no matter what time of year)."

The small park, with chairs that can be moved around, goes to 6th Avenue. There is a restaurant and bar (two I believe) behind the Library. A large lawn where you can sit and get sun when the weather is good. Films are shown in the summer and there is an ice skating rink in the winter. Small shops line up along the paths before Christmas."

It's pretty entertaining to see the ppl who are really struggling to stay on two feet but are still loving the experience! Great for free people watching! If you feel like shopping, there are also some vendors at their holiday market.Hint: grab a cup of coffee or cocoa on your way! They serve it in the park but you can get a $1 cup and bring it into the park to save some $$$."

Why would I pay the better part of $100 to skate on a smaller rink over at Rockefeller Plaza just because there's a big tree there. Plus the holiday market surrounding City pond is great to pick up unique gifts and get awesome melt in your mouth kettle corn or hot chocolate.

Bryant Park was donated to the citizens of New York/humanity, one welcome and very generous gift. Do make time to visit it. You will leave refreshed, with memories of trees, flowers, shrubs,- nature- co-existing amid such chaos,one step away."

Have visited it in both daylight and under the evening stars. Under lights at night is well worth the visit. Not only Citipond but the other buildings surrounding the park. Over 100 small self standing shops have been erected and are worth looking at. Especially loved the 'itsallaboutthetail' shop which sells cat/dog clocks. Have bought one already and if Hurricane Sandy allows will be collecting a 'flag cat' clock on Tuesday morning to take home to Austalia. Skating is free and goes for 129 days!'"

Lots of chairs and tables where you can sit in the sun, or a shady spot. The carousel is awesome for the little ones and adults alike. Several little stands where you can buy drinks, sandwiches, and soup. The soup sold there is wonderful. The people watching is fun too. There is a huge grassy area where you can relax and watch a concert, etc. That area turns into an ice skating rink as soon as the weather turns cold. Also, about the middle of October they set up little shops throughout the park for shopping for that unique gift. I love this park :)"

When you think of New York City\u2019s parks Central Park tops most lists, and for good reason, but I encourage you to branch out and try some of the smaller parks in the city like Bryant Park. Named after William Cullen Bryant, the great poet and former editor of the New York Evening Post, the park is appropriately situated next to the huge New York City Public Library which is famous for both its beauty and for many Ghostbusters movie scenes. This park is small but alive. The center of the park is a huge open space where folks sunbathe, picnic, or read. The park is well manicured and contains plenty of benches and chairs. A huge William Cullen Bryant statute is on the east side of the park. A nice outdoor bar is on the north side of the statute while the trendy Bryant Park Grill lies to the south. There is a beautiful fountain on the southern end of the park along with a really nice bar called Witchcraft which is located on the \u201cSouthwest Porch.\u201d The drinks are pricey but I would definitely have a glass of wine under the breathtakingly beautiful trees that provide protection from the sun. The extreme western end of Bryant Park has contains an area called \u201cBryant Park Games\u201d where you can play chess, checkers, ping pong and bocce ball while the north side has, get this, the Bryant Park Reading Room, an outdoor reading room where you can check out books (remember those) and read until after dawn. If your children are in tow, make sure you take then to Le Carrousel, a French-style merry-go-round located on the southern end.I would highly suggest having an after dinner drink or lunch the next time you visit New York City."

Just like any other big cities in the world, New Yorkers are packing themselves like sardines inside their apartment buildings. Luckily, there are some parks in Manhattan they can go to get fresh air, have sunbath, or do outdoor exercises. Bryant Park is one of the choices. There are always different events going on in the park, such as ice skating in the winter, and movie screening in the summer. It is conveniently located on 42nd street. Public can take B, D, F, M, or 7 train to go there. Public can also take the M42 crosstown bus to get to the park. I watched a free movie (actually I watched just about 1/10 of the movie), got a free Sierra Mist cap, ... took a Southwest Airlines square dance lesson, and got a Southwest Airlines free flip book in the park about three and a half hours ago. Byrant Park serves both worlds, it doesn't matter if you are very rich, or if you are totally broke. Check it out if you have time, I think you will enjoy it doesn't matter if you go there by yourself or if you go there with your loved ones."

Jugglers, an accordionist, a carousel full of kids, a table set up for board games...wherever you turn, there's something to catch your eye and get you wondering, \"Why can't more cities create a community hub like this?\" As a tourist in Bryant Park, I felt part of the scene. If I lived within subway distance, I'd be a proud regular. Don't miss the elegant restrooms, with seafoam-green tiles, pioed-in classical music (a bit hard to ear with the noise of the hand dryers) and--can it be?--fresh flowers.

Close by to this park is the HBO store which you can purchase items from their shows. This was my first visit to a park in New York and I was really impressed. I love all the chairs and tables, people were reading and having coffee. I wanted to sit and have a coffee but it seemed none of the cafes in the park were open, I noticed people had Starbucks coffee cups, it was around 11.30am on a weekday. There was a bar/cafe setting up but not in service, in fact, they had an attitude issue when I asked if I could purchase a drink. There is an area where they have a carousel for kids and an activity area, children were painting and reading when we walked past. It was a lovely sunny morning. There is a large lawn area in the middle which shows movies on a Monday evening during the Summer. There are many great parks in New York to visit, Central Park is not the only one!"

And although I enjoy Central Park, I was absolutely delighted to experience Bryant Park. It is a manageable size and right in the middle of all the action of the city. It was fun to see people out and about enjoying a summer day. People were playing chess, bicycling, and just relaxing. I especially loved the lush and well-maintained flower beds and containers. I would love to visit again in the winter and see the little ice skating rink they provide in the park. The NY Public Library is adjacent to the park and the Bryant Park Grill (duh) is in one corner. I loved it."

In one section of the park, you can rent games like chess and Apples to Apples and sit outside and play. There are lots of picnic tables and chairs to sit in. In another corner of the park is a small outdoor bar. The New York Library is on the east side of the park. The architecture of some of the buildings surrounding the park is very appealing too.

It was a very quick 3 minute walk out of the library and around the corner into the park.Nice seats and benches were available for us to pick up and move onto the lawn for the show. The lawn is nicely laid out so it can accommodate a large number of people comfortably with unobstructed views. Each of our 25 kids got a seat. There is always something going on from free movies on Monday nights to daily card, chess and sports activities scheduled on the main lawn. The park is frequented by Fashion Industry employees, celebrities and business people working in the trendy location.There are also cafes carts , a restaurant a fountain. The park is accessible by the D,F, and B trains as well as the M42 and M104 Buses."

Taking that into the account the size of the Bryant Park alongside with the busy part of Manhattan where is it located I can only give two thumbs up to the person or the team who stands behind it. There is a little something for everyone in it, next to the Public Library + its maintenance is superb. There are two reading sections at each side of the park, one for adults with the variety of newspapers and magazines. and one mini- library for the kids right across, next to the old fashion Carousel ( $2 per ride) which my son loved! ( people who run it seemed nice)There are few little kiosks-cafes with the seated areas all over the park, probably good for coffee, food, snacks and beverages, but frankly I haven't used them at least not recently.The biggest surprise ( and the pleasant one!) in the park for me was- the public bathroom! It is maintained as a bathroom of some luxurious place, with the attendant on site,a disposable plastic toilet covers , most importantly it was very clean! (they even have a bouquet of fresh flowers in there :)!!)Bryant Park and its management should serve as a role model to many public park's managements.In the winter time (as all new yorkers know) the whole park becomes an ice ring- (admission free of charge if you bring your own skates) otherwise just pay for the rental."

Not only is this experience awesome, it's also free! You may have to wait in line, my family went a few days after christmas and it took about 2 hours, but it was definatly worth the wait! Skating when surrounded by all the lights and skyskrapers is amazing, definatly comparable to Rockefeller, and a lot more affordable! :)"

The past couple of years the park has hosted a holiday market starting in November tha runs through the first week in January. There is ice skating ang lots of kiosks for food and hot chocolate. There are shops that sell everything from original artwork and jewelry to christmas ornaments anf clothing. A nice place to get your Christmas shopping done!.

This is also a great place to people watch during the day as it's mostly filled with locals on their lunch break during weekdays. I haven't done so personally, but hear that the ice-skating rink is very crowded. However, if you don't mind then crowd, then have fun."

Small enough to not feel lost yet large easy to forget about the hustle of 42nd street just a block away. Many unique events throughout the year - summer outdoor films on the lawn. The best is the free ice skating rink between October and February. The park gets crowded (often uncomfortably) when the Christmas market springs up after Thanksgiving. Year-round outdoor open air bar bar in the 40th Street/6th Avenue corner is a wondeful place for a drink in the summer."

Our first trip was in the summer and for breakfast each morning we would buy some juice/coffees etc. in a small deli called Bryant Market just down the road from the park on the corner of Avenue of the Americas and 38th Street and walk back up to the park to eat them. In the summer its great to sit there and watch the city go by. Our winter trip was just before Christmas and we would start each day with some ice skating on at Citi Pond. Summer or winter the park is buzzing. Well worth a visit."

The crush of the crowds and cranky people really put a damper on our day, so I googled skating in New York City to find a better option.After a short walk to Bryant Park, we easily found the long line to the skating rink. The attendant told us not to worry, the line moves quickly. He was right! Twenty minutes later my daughter and I were in skates and on the ice. Crowded yes, everything is crowded in New York, but the flow of skaters was good. With friendly attendants, lots of happy skaters, and a place for Dad to relax with coffee and a newspaper, WE HAD A GREAT AFTERNOON!"

Proud to be New York's only free skating rink it seems that thousands flock to it and I feel that you pay the price in dealing with the huge amounts of people in one skating rink. We waited about and hour + and once we finally got to skate it was pretty scary with lots of people knocking down novices and old pros alike. We go ice skating every time we go to NY, and we do inline skating often at home, we're not new at this. I don't think it's the rink's fault, it's just that it was way too many people, and I would rather pay a bit more and not be scared someone's going to slam into me every other second."

Bryant Park dresses up for the holidays with holiday vendors surrounding the ice skating rink. Places to sit, meet friends, grab a snack, drink, meal or a gift or two. It screams \"Christmas is coming\" and you cannot help but get into the spirit of the season. When spring arrives, Bryant Park changes her look. She sprouts a beautiful fountain as the focal point. Coffee bars and snack bars can be found selling treats. Pleanty of seating can be had to just sit and enjoy the fresh air as the park welcomes visitors.The Bryant Park Cafe and Grill is a welcome destination for drinks with friends, dinner with family or a private party. Don't miss Bryant Park the next time you are in NYC."

The only thing I didn't like was that there were many skaters who went really fast and among the slow skaters and made you unstable and scared to fall. I guess it is like that in all rinks unfortunately. There should be certain hours for experts...Don't take any bags, you will have to rent a locker. There is no need."

After walking through the Public Library, next door, Bryant Park made a great stop to rest our feet and relax. What we liked about Bryant Park compared to other patches of green in NYC was the green ivy that crawled along the ground, instead of traditional grass. This meant that Bryant Park remained refreshingly green during our visit last week, perfectly complimenting the Xmas decorations and atmosphere that had engulfed this park. Bryant Park also has an ice-skating rink and numerous Christmas vendors stationed within the park grounds, adding to a very pleasant festive atmosphere that was easy to enjoy. We really liked what we saw during our quick stop at Bryant Park and would suggest planning a stop there during your trip to this area of NYC. It is ideally situated between Grand Central Station and Time Square so perhaps instead of taking the subway, you could walk the distance instead so as to be able to visit Bryant Park."

However, during the summer months it becomes an entertainment space, featuring broadway acts, HBO Monday night at the movies, and concert space. During the winter months it houses the holiday bazaar and the Citi Pond ice skating rink and bar. It was the former home of the NY Fashion Week. The bottom line is, Bryant Park is consistently transforming itself and no matter what, there's always something happening. I love walking by and being able to have some sort of experience at the Park; whether it's watching an intense chess game, a performance or enjoying other's enjoy the park!It's a must!"

There are some interesting shops selling a wide, wide array of merchandise. Additionally, there are food stalls. You can find Turkish phyllo rolls, crepes, designer hot dogs, hot pickles, dumplings, etc, etc. Additionally, the SouthWest grill has a fire pit, so the scent of wood smoke at that end of the park adds to the wintery holiday feeling. Even if you visit the park in the other seaosns, its usually an oasis from all the hustle and bustle of NYC. I usually walk through just to get a few minutes of relief from having my NYC \"face\" on. Finally, you will not find a nicer public restroom anywhere in NYC, guaranteed."

It opens at 8 AM and closes at 10 PM except for weekends when it stays open until midnight. Our family brought our own ice skates and locks for lockers so entry was free (though we paid to get two pairs of skates sharpened for the season). You can pay to rent skates, but there is not time limit on the skating. It was pretty crowded when our family went on a Friday late in the afternoon, but we still had a great time. There are security skaters on the rink to help anyone as needed and to keep things orderly. My husband & I went on a weekday in the morning and there were not many people. The music is fun and romantic. The skyscrapers and park surrounding the rink are beautiful. There are many vendors in booths selling interesting, handmade items. There are even ping pong tables and books to read (an extension of the library) in the park to use for free. Really enjoyable opportunity!"

It was pretty busy as well but the wait wasnt too bad. Ice skating was a little steep at $14 a person, same price for kids. The ice skates were fairly new and in great condition. The rink was crowded and didnt make for ideal skating, but in general this is a great place to skate. The views of the bldgs around you is great as well. The park was full of local vendors selling their wares and munchies. All in all a good place to skate and shop during the holidays."

We avoided any lines, walked right in to a special line to get our skates and onto the ice. It was crowded but not overly crowded. the staff kept everyone safe and was attentive when someone fell. Great time to skate outdoors in the middle of the city. Must grab a crepe and/or a drink afterward from one of the many vendors afterwards.It was the highlight of my kids (22, 17, 12) weekend."

A little expensive if you need to rent skates ($15 I think). Food is not good there at all so eat before or after...I love the pop up restaurant near the rink..it has a funky cool ambiance and you can have a somewhat reasonable priced drink and appetizers there...I mean given the location and the fact that you are in NYC...adult beverages are $9-12 and cheapest app around $7 bux...IN the summer Bryant Park is awesome with free movies in the park (my all time fave), music concerts, dance and yoga classes and more! They even have a ping pong table there and an extension of the library!!! So cool. Lastly, more adult beverage places throughout the park for happy hours and such.

Winter brings free ice skating (you have to pay for rental if you own your own pair of skates), the xmas shops and now they have a new two-story high restaurant/lounge overseeing the ice skating rink and shops. Also a Southwest Porch where you can hang out and have dinks outdoors with some old fashion chairs. There is always a variety in Bryant Park. I am always checking out the events"

We were also able to sit and watch a game of boules/petanque that some gents were playing which was good fun.

We didn't go skating but love that was free for the ice time. (there was a $14 fee for rentals if you didn't have your own skates.) I also loved the carousel, and the children's reading area, complete with a well-stocked book trolley. (As a teacher, that warmed by heart!) I highly recommend taking a stroll over!"

Have you ever wanted to see a favorite classic movie lying out in a beautiful city park, surrounded by the snug of quiety imposing skyscrapers in the middle of New York's mid-town Manhattan? Well, you can; and it's free! Bryant Park's Summer movie program is a once-a-week treat throughout July & August every year, and quite honestly, should not be missed. Bring a nice bottle of wine, a selection of cheese and light crackers, and a good friend or two to picnic with, and just wait for sundown and then for the show to flicker up in the world's most incredible outdoor cinema experience. Classic movie titles range from Raiders of the Lost Arc, West Side Story and Dr. Zhivago, and often include a gem from Disney (watching the dwarfs call out the \"Hi-Hoooo\" to each other as the prelude to the song in the midst of the night-time hum of mid-town made for a most refreshing viewing of Snow White!). Whatever the movie though, it's pretty much irrelevant, as it's the whole experience of a night-time picnic at a movie in one of the most beautiful parks in this incredible city that makes it an unmissible must-do whenever you're in New York for the Summer. In addition to the free Summer movie program, Bryant Park itself is such a serene park at any time of the day: with deck chairs and fold-out tables all caressing the gravel sides of the park; perfect for am occasional lunch-time snooze, an afternoon's game of chess with a friend, or just the pass the day with a good book and a sandwich; and amidst all the midtown traffic, one can barely hear it around you. What is also especially wonderful about this unique city park is that it also quite small, a sort of cozier and more intimate version of it's bigger brother 20 blocks up the road (Central Park); in other words, it's a park you can truly get to know. But it's also a park that puffs up for the Winter, and at Christmas time, like everywhere else in New York, most especially. The Christmassy side shops and vendor stands all lit up to the nines, the local families out shopping (remember this park is within easy walking distance for the many families living in the Fashion District, Hell's Kitchen, as well as Murray Hill) with the soft patter of children chasing each other with snowballs, or smurf-like infants being pulled along by their fathers on baby-sleighs, and to top it all it now has a wonderful little ice-rink which is wholly on a par with the Rockerfeller. As the park essentially starts on the north-end at 36th street, it is also only 6 blocks away from Broadway & 42nd, so whatever you're night-out, or reason to be in mid-town, Bryant Park is an easy lay-away from it all. In fact, this neat, cozy, treat of a park is so quintessentially New York that I have often wondered why there hasn't been an entire movie story revolving around it. Worth a visit - at any time of the year."

After we exhausted the usual attractions (like the not-to-be-missed watching Macy's balloons get blown up the night before the parade - it's better than even the parade itself). Anyhow what we were really looking for was something to tire the kid out. He's four, with energy to spare, and he'd had all he could take of sitting still in restaurants while the adults chatted. What I thought would be just a ho-hum experience for the adults turned out to be really pretty magical, thanks to the holiday music the ice rink was playing and the curtain of snow flurries that started, seemingly, on cue. Pros: Free entry fee; $5 skate fee; good concession stand; good music; not too crowded mid-afternoon on a weekdayCons: Plastic skates very uncomfortable (bring your own if you have them) for adults (kids don't seem to notice); no earphones allowed for those who would like to skate to their own music"

In the summer, it's a pretty good place to wait for your train.Unlike most of Midtown, it's not overrun with tourists. There are plenty of things to do, including Petanque, Ping Pong, Chess, Backgammon and a small library (and a skating rink in the Winter), but we prefer to people-watch and relax under the sycamores.When you've come to the end of a long day, trudging about the City, Bryant Park can come as welcome relief.Recommended, but keep it to yourselves."

The location is spot on and within close walking distance of the major attractions in mid town. The rooms are simple and elegant, with great views if you are looking over the park and all its hustle and bustle - great people watching! The exterior of the building is also magnificent, and in case you didn't know (and what sold it for me) it was featured in Ghostbusters!The bar downstairs is great and while we were there had a free bar for an hour every weekday! The events organisors and concierge recommended some brilliant restaurants, bars and clubs getting us guest list for places we wouldn't have otherwise got in to. Darren and the team regonised we had some celebrating to do (I proposed to my girlfriend and it was my birthday) and really made it special, we felt they were sharing in our experience.

It's a lovely atmosphere just to wonder around.The ice-rink is one of the larger ones in NY and even if you aren't skating it's great to people watch with a mug of warm cider.Even outside of Xmas time I can imagine that this park is a lovely place to come and sit. It's certainly not the biggest but there are some lovely views of the Empire State the Chrysler and the library. It's fairly central and near many other tourist attractions, so whatever time of year you are in NY, I'd certainly look around Bryant Park."

The staff were brilliant and would do anything for you, the rooms were amazing. Bathroom was massive and was spotless and was cleaned every day. Was dissapointed about our view but you cannot get everything. Bryant Park was just across the road to chill and have a beer. This hotel is a perfect location sub way just down the street and 5 mins from Broadway and time square."

Go to Pret a Manger across the street, grab a great sandwich and park yourself in Bryant Park for a great urbanista picnic and people-watching extravaganza. Then after lunch, let the others go shopping in the surrounding area while you kick back with the paper, a camera, and enjoy the scenery. Tucked behind the iconic NYC Public Library, this is a perfect respite from the city in any season. Bryant Park Grill, The Southwest Porch and other food there too."

While my husband was subjected to biz meetings, I got to hang out in the area for a couple of hours and practice my photography. I had envisioned myself exhausted from walking for blocks...but, I never left the park! There was so much to see and do here...the first time I looked at my watch, I was already late!It was December. The stark leafless trees were incredibly beautiful against the backdrop of high-rise buildings, some with perfect reflections of the sky and trees surrounding them...made for some stunning photographs. The ice skating rink was full of people...I could have watched for hours. When I finally made it to the other side of the park, I was treated to a ton of artisans and food vendors selling the most beautiful and unique creations at great prices (for the most part).I can't wait to return and see the park in the spring and summer!!!"

Although the city is surrounding you, its a nice break from the urban escapades. There's a chocolate kiosk there w/' awesome hot chocolate and chocolate covered strawberry for a pretty good deal. Otherwise, its just that..... a nice park."

The Christmas fair is so cute and fun to browse, with everything from traditional wreaths and candles to more unusual gifts, like rhinestone iPod cases. It's free to skate at the rink there (unlike the one at Rockefeller Center), and those less athletically inclined are always welcome to watch. There's also a beautiful tree. Highly recommended."

It is cheaper (free admission and a fee to rent skates) and less crowded than Rockefeller Center. There are several neat shops to look at and we recommend eating at Celcius. It's a bar/restaurant that has outdoor seating (with heaters of course). We went on a weeknight around 9 or 10 and there was a 30 min wait to sit outside and a 10 minute wait to sit upstairs which overlooks the rink. The food was reasonably priced at around 12-18 and was delicious. The atmosphere is posh and remember to look up- there is a glass celing which is really neat!"

Bryant Park is a bit of quiet, when compared to places that it neighbours, such as Times Square and 5th Avenue. I went in the winter and the ice rink was set up around the tree and a Christmas Market was offering various crafts to buy. I imagine in the summer it is a lovely little place to stop and unwind for a while. In the winter it was a bit too cold to do that but was still nice to wonder around. Cheapest ice rink around, from what I gather."

            "review": "NICE Holiday vendors, Christmas Tree, Free ice skating park, carousel & More. My husband and I stumbled across Bryant Park a few years ago. We used to go to NY to Macy's and to Rockefeller Center to see the tree. Well, one trip we happened to walk up 6th Avenue and stumble upon Bryant Park's Holiday Shops & The Pond. We stopped in and took a look around. Ever since then, we have made Bryant Park one of our must-see stops when we are in NYC for the Holidays.Our most recent visit to Bryant Park was Dec 6th 2009. We went to Bryant Park 1st as to walk around the Holiday Vendor's shops in the daylight. Bryant Park has lots of little shacks set up with various types of vendors. You can buy anything from jewelry to hats & scarves. There is also christmas ornaments, tin signs, candles, puppets and MORE. Many of the vendors have an artsy or homemade feel to them. They also sell all kinds of snacks at the little shacks including: baked dog treats, mon ami truffles, flavored kettle corn, apple cider, crepes, waffles, chocolate covered strawberries/bananas/marshmallows, caramel apples, hot chocolate, dumplings & dumpling soups, terikyaki bar food and sandwiches. We always stop at The Sweet Shop and get one of their chocolate covered fruit sticks--the banana stick is pretty good. We have also stopped and sampled the french truffles from No Chewing Allowed. We have bought them in the past, but we passed on them this year. They are pretty good too, just a tad expensive. You can probably pick up some unique thoughtful Christmas Presents here too!!Also Byrant Park has a pretty nice sized lighted Christmas Tree. It is not as big as the Rockefeller Center tree, but it is still a really nice tree. It is beautifully decorated and trimmed with lights. Near the tree, is The Pond ice skating rink. Here you can skate for free IF you have your own skates. If you do not, then you can rent a pair for $12.00 (2009). You can also rent a lock for the FREE lockers and also pay for bag check here if needed. Skating on the Pond is available from 8am until 10pm (or midnight depending on the day). IF you do not have VIP pass, then you will have to stand in the LONG general admission line. We have never gone skating since the line is usually really really long--and it was no exception this year either! Right behind the entrance to the Pond ice skating rink is Le Carrousel. It is a small children's carousel. It has some beautiful horses on it in addition to some unusual animals like a frog. Tickets are only $2.00 each or you can buy a discount booklet (10 rides for $15.00). While we were there, we also noticed that they were getting ready to have a Magic Show that day at 1pm just in front of the carousel. We did not stick around for it, but just know that they hold events like this from time to time. If you check the website, you will see the calendar of events, including the magic shows.Byrant Park also has a nice water fountain and several small tables to rest or dine at. We will often buy a snack from one of the Bryant Park vendors OR one of the street vendors and grab a small table inside Bryant Park. It is a nice place to vist and rest for a few minutes. I enjoy watching the small birds inside this park too. They are really cute. We enjoy walking around the park, checking out the holiday vendors, watching people ice skate & ride the carousel, and getting a chocolate covered banana stick. Overall, Bryant Park is a nice green space to visit within the city. We thoroughly enjoy our winter time visits & would recommend it to others who will be visiting in November, December or early January. I'm sure it is a nice place to visit during the other seasons too, but we have only been during the winter months. We love it & will continue to visit there while we are in town visiting the holiday tree at Rockefeller Center, Macy's Santa Land & Holiday Lane, F.A.O. Schwarz and MORE!! It is a nice way to spend the holidays."

Spend an hour (at least) and you'll be glad you did!Visit the www.bryantpark.org web site and download their great audio tour to your MP3 player. It's hosted by Matthew Broderick, and he walks with you around the park, giving you insights and anecdotes that you'd never get from a travel guide. This is no facts-and-figures tour, it's an introduction to the hidden spirit of one of New York's most unique places, entertainingly delivered by someone who clearly loves it.The audio tour helped us go a little slower, and see a lot more!"

A stone's throw from Broadway, Times Square and Fifth Avenue, and adjacent to Bryant Park where there is an ice-skating rink in the winter, this is exceptionally well positioned. First impressions are a little mixed as the modern decor of the reception lobby is a little dark and depressing, as is the elevator to the rooms, but the room I had was totally magnificent - modern styling, clean, large and comfortable and with good views to the park. It is adjoined by a large marble-clad bathroom with a shower independent from the bath. The cellar has a vibrant nightclub stocked with NY glitterati. Beware the cost of the hotel's restaurant (like all NY top end hotels) but there is a great (in fact totally fantastic) bistro restaurant just 50 yards to the west of the hotel called Pain Quotidien ('Daily bread' in French) where you can get a much better breakfast than served in the hotel for a fraction of the price.The combination of this hotel and the Pain Quotidien, makes this a really great place to stay. I'll certainly go back."
