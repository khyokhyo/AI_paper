An interesting modern building that serves to display the exhibits well - although for a newish building it is in worrying condition. Exhibits are well displayed with explanations in Vietnamese, French and English. Much of this coverage of Vietnam's minority people was new to me and something of a revelation. The display of costumes was particularly nicely done and the frequent use of videos helped bring it all to life. The bonus is the reconstruction of numerous ethnic buildings to scale in the grounds behind the museum building. Include it on your must do list in Hanoi"

This well presented (and air conditioned) museum offers a fascinating insight into the melting pot of cultures that make up the country of Vietnam. With lots of visual references and English guides, this museum not only showcases the history and underlying premise of each culture, it also offers a tangible understanding of what makes them 'tick'. The recreated 'village' outside is also pretty amazing."

Lots of knowledge about it in the museum... But I like the outside part of the museum more, there r lots and different kinds of traditional houses, u could even come insides of them... There was even a water puppet show when we were there... And the infos r also in English, so I think u could do this even without a tour guide (we did it with a tour guide though)..."

We spent the majority of our time exploring the display houses in the outdoor area of the museum. Boys loved climbing the steep wooden ladder like steps to get into the houses on stilts. There was also a bamboo balancing beam that kept them entertained for a good half hour. Our last stop was the discovery centre (top floor) where they were taught how to play a traditional kids game, which we half got the gist of due to age and language constraints, look at paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks, and do some wooden block stamping. Great value for money and was great for kids and adults alike."

A great place to visit with kids too as they have a great many things to see including the various houses of different ethnic groups replicated out doors.

Great park and kids will love it!"

It may be a bit hurried if you are the kind of person who likes to read all of the signs, but you can always go back through after on your own if you have specific ones you'd like to examine in more detail.The garden behind the main building is especially epic with so many buildings from the various ethnic groups. Real variety and detailed signs guiding you around and explaining them in Viet, English and French."

We had done much research and reviews and were looking forward to visiting for some hours. But, alas, we made the wrong decision to go by tuk tuk instead of a car. The peddler assured us he knew where to go and after an hour of him stopping and him asking 5 people where it was located we had then run out of time. So disappointing but when we return to Hanoi we will get a taxi and go directly to the museum. This place is worth an excellent vote from our hours of research. If you are staying in the Old Quarter do not get a tuk tuk to take you."

There was a great amount of physical artifacts that were beautifully displayed throughout. The signage was easy and interesting to read. My favorite part was outside on the grounds. There are 7 different types of homes reconstructed to give an idea of how the different minorities have lived throughout the country. Signs let you know which families lived in each home, at what time and in what part of the country. You can expect to stay here for about an hour, although there is a great restaurant on site if you get hungry during your stay."

This museum takes you on a tour of the ethnic groups from all areas around Vietnam. Inside has some great artefacts which the kids weren't really interested in however going outside into the gardens was just what we were looking for. Original huts and homes from the various groups have been rebuilt into the museum grounds. You can take a walk through these houses and structures and get a glimpse into their way of life. The kids got a great insight and asked lots of questions as they made their way through the homes. Can highly recommend this on your visit to Hanoi!"

We live in Cambodia so they were familiar with many of the artifacts on display having seen variants on them while staying with their grandparents in their village near the border with Vietnam. They really enjoyed the collection of houses at the museum and the 'hands-on' experience of going through different dwellings from around the country. Highly recommended and informative museum and one that keeps the attention of children"

There are historical stories on the wall describing the unique path of each \"tribe\" and culture in Vietnam, as well as clothing, artifacts and photos describing the origins of each group. Outside, in the back of the museum there are examples of different housing typical of each tribes, and near the front entrance there is a souvenir centre and a shop with artistic pieces that can be bought for a very reasonable price.

While it was busy, packed with tourists, school children, local families and ordinary Vietnamese, it allowed one to understand the hereditary makeup of the people of Vietnam from their origins, groupings, lifestyle, customs, dialects and beliefs. The outdoor museum allows visitors to experience being inside some of the traditional dwellings of some of the groups and a water puppets show if offered for free on Sundays if one is fortunate enough to find a seat for this popular traditional performance. A must-do in Vietnam to meet the people in one place."

Today large parts of it are in a state of disrepair. Sidewalks are overgrown with weeds. When we went there (week day afternoon), there were no other tourists. Apparently the situation is better on weekends. The government has brought in people from the respective ethnicities to many of the villages. They are paid to stay there 24/7 and dress up in their national costumes to entertain visitors. We visited two such houses. In the first, the residents were overjoyed to see us because they had been bored to no end having had no visitors. They said they are paid around $60 a month for living there but could earn more had they stayed in their own village. They were very happy to talk with us, perform a song and give us tea. When we offered them a little money as thanks, they didn't want to take it. The second house was a bit more organized (had a shop where they sold clothes and other handicraft) but were equally bored.I had mixed feelings because on the one hand it does not seem right to truck in people of ethnic communities from their original villages and put them on display. On the other hand, a tourist like me who only had time to visit Ha Noi would not have had the chance to meet ethnic minorities."

Wow I'm not usually a museum person but this brings to life the culture of the Vietnamese.My wife and I went there and although the main museum part was interesting (lots of reading as per normal museum), the best part was the buildings.There is a large landscape of buildings and the best part is you can go in them and have a look.We were most impresses by the 19m high thatched roof one.I'm 30 and not into architecture nether is my wife but we ended up spending a good hour and a half but we would have pushed over 2 hours f not for the rain.I would highly recommend this and also, get a guide from the front that can speak your language.We didn't and we regretted the information that had for people (we eavesdropped haha)"

If you can't make it up north to the mountains (Sapa, for ex), definitely go to the Ethnology museum for a great collection of ethnic minority textiles, houses (they actually have recreations of the houses!) and other objects. It's well put together and really gives you an idea of the different cultures. If you are going up north, you will see most of the stuff in person, so it's not really necessary if you don't have loads of time! Also, there is a free water puppet show once or twice a day. Great way to see a water puppet show if you're not keen on sitting though a whole performance"

There was build houses as in the old days where you can enter and see then inside. The outside was best for the kids as they could move around.

It has 3 sections: a large building dedicated to Vietnam people, a large open area with reconstructions of houses, tombs used by the different Vietnamese groups, and a second large building dedicated to SE-Asian people. I would not recommend the last building, unless you are strongly interested in fabrics, etc from SE Asia. However, the Vietnamese building was far more interesting...good exhibits well explained (including English and French). But I found the highlight to be the outside garden. Basically, they had employed craftsmen from the tribal areas to construct full size houses in the style of their home.

We decided to do the outdoor part of the Museum first in case it rained. The children (age almost 8 years) really enjoyed visiting the houses, looking inside each one, and doing various activities outdoors. It was a Sunday and so maybe they had more outdoor activities. One place had tops you could spin, another had stilts you could try to walk on, and being outdoors the children were free to move quickly from one place to the other. There was also a place making kites. The water puppet show was included in the Museum price, but not as fancy as the one in the theatre near the Hoan Kiem Lake. It was outdoors and quite interesting. There was English translation explaining each activity. Inside the museum there were various exhibits. This indoor 2 storey complex had lots of artifacts and pictures to explain the ethnic backgrounds and groups that make up the Vietnamese culture. Parents with younger children may find this part more challenging, but it was good for primary school and older children and adult. Overall quite an educational experience and one that should not be missed. If you are in Hanoi, be sure to make time for this. There was a bookstore and also a museum shop, but we didn't make it there. There is a restaurant, but apparently they only serve food at lunch-time, but you can get snacks, drinks otherwise. In May 2016 there was an adult price of about US$2.50 and children about $1.80; excellent value. Our one regret was that we didn't have more time - we found 3 hours was not enough and we could easily have stayed another hour. Besides that there is a great park for children across the road, but we didn't have time to spend there - which we would love to have done. If you have pre and primary school children, I would suggest you consider making it a day. You could take a picnic lunch and eat in the park and let the children play. If you are staying over in the Old Quarter or in that type of area near Hoan Kiem lake expect to pay about $5 by taxi to get to the park as it's several km away."

One you leave the building...DON'T exit!! Walk to your left where the coffee and restaurant is (btw this is a good restaurant to support! It's run entirely by a hospitality school, and you're helping the students learn great service skills so they can get full-time employment after graduation) and you'll see what looks like a small park. Keep walking and you'll happen upon a huge village comprised of various minority group style homes! You can even go inside and check out how cool they are. All or most of the structures were built for the museum by minority group builders and artisans so they are sturdy, and quite amazing! Peeking around the houses took up a big chunk of time. Give yourself 3-4 hrs (including lunch/coffee break at cafe) if you want to see everything. The \"craft link\" not-for-profit organization shop is chock full of well-made gifts and crafts that seeks to \"assist small Vietnamese craft producers to develop their businesses and find market opportunities...generating income for poor and marginalized people.\" Everything there is much better made than the usual tourist crap on the streets, and actually way cheaper.

The theatre isn't as impressive as the show we'd seen in the old quarter the previous night but it seemed more authentic, being set in an outdoor lake.The original building (in the shape of a traditional drum) of the museum is quite small but has some interesting background (in english) on the different ethnicities that make up Vietnam, detailing their origins, providing details on the language families and displaying artefacts. The newer building specialises in other parts of South East Asia.There is a cafe on site.It is easy (and cheap) to get to / from this museum by taxi. Don't do as we did and accept a ride from a driver who walks up to the gate, jumping the queue (turned out he had a dodgy racy meter), go to the taxis parked out front instead."

First is a large indoor 2 storey complex with loads of artifacts and static pictures to explain the ethnic backgrounds and groups that make up this culture. 2nd part is located in the grounds and is a mini city comprising a different home style for each ethnic group, life sized and very interactive. Unfortunately the day we visited was raining hard so we only ventured into around 5 of these homes but the weather got the better of us and we skipped the rest.

There's also a lovely restaurant which is great for taking a break and recovering from the heat - the buildings are quite cool but not as air-conditioned as some, and if you're used to a cool climate you might need a few coke breaks! Definitely don't get a taxi from right outside when you leave - they're twice the price. Walk a little way down the road and hail one!"

Was good to visit to understand the history and cultures of vietnam, just a bit too much reading for myself, would be great if there was more interactive videos or something along that lines. We had a few groups of children (maybe 7-8 year old and uni students) approach us with their teachers wanting them to ask us questions in english and do an interview to help strengthen their english language. Was great to be apart of this and interact with them. However after a while we had 4 or 5 others approach us which got a bit too much. Took around 40mins to walk through the entire exhibition. Cheap entry aswell."

The indoor provides an overview of Vietnam's ethnic population and diversity and the outdoor museum gives you a feel of their different living styles. We visited this museum as part of a day tour and it was worth the trip. Just right of the main entrance is a caf\u00e9 and the museum also puts up a water puppet show. I don't recall the show being advertised in the museum anywhere as we came across it when we left the building to visit the outdoor part. We didn't hover around long and moved on to explore the different house styles, as we didn't think the show was that good."

The museum itself has interesting things to look at but wasn't very concise or informative - no dates or info about the hunting tools, woven baskets etc. Lots of clothes to look at but to be honest you can find them in the women's museum which is a lot closer and has more to read and has a lot of the same stuff. The reconstructions of huts in the garden are really beautiful though! And the museum is next to an exhibition on Indonesian art (again no info and they're all from the 1990's but really cool to look at)"

Some of the exhibits are in spacious modern buildings ( 2). The main building is of semi circular nature with displays over 2 floors. All information is in 3 languages, Vietnamese, French and English. The artefacts are well exhibited with informative details. There is plenty of room for viewing and moving around and seats are installed at several points. There are no internal interactive displays. A recent addition is a separate building concentrating on exhibits from South East Asia. In the grounds of the museum are examples of around 11 tribal houses representing typical rural life. There is also two restaurants side by side, offering a full menu for local food or coffee and snacks. Both restaurants are run by a non profit organisation training students from difficult circumstances. Over 7000 students have benefited from this training since 1996."

Nothing else was interactive and there were just a few small tv screens playing video throughout the museum - it was 90% artifacts behind glass with write-ups beside them. Or large posters with facts and info. If you had to choose between this museum and the Women's Museum I'd recommend the Women's Museum. There are many similarities between the two."

The inside displays are set out well, and with enough interactive learning to engage little ones. Outside of the main museum building was my favourite part of the museum exhibition: the life-size examples of architecture specific to each ethnic group. By allowing visitors to climb inside, you can get a real sense of what it's like to live in and share these spaces. Also outside is a water puppet theatre which holds regular shows, so if you hear them calling, try to catch a sight of the plays. We went too late in the day to finish the whole museum (arrived at 2 and they start closing at 5) so I would suggest arriving earlier, pack a lunch, and take your time to really engage with what you're seeing."

Firstly, the collections are well curated, set out throughout the building with ample space and good lighting. The supporting information in displays is well written and presented. Although the collection housed in the main building is fantastic, my favourite section is actually housed in the gardens to the rear of the museum. Here, an impressive collection of original ethnic housing structures have been relocated, including the crowd favourite long house and Catu house. Make sure to pop into the Craftlink store on your way back to the car (it's in the carpark). The shelves are jam-packed full of beautiful handicrafts by many of the 54 ethnic minority groups of Vietnam."

It's very interesting to \"climb\" into one and imagine the living conditions of the people. The indoor exhibits are also a great way to learn about the history of Vietnam (Vietnam war), its people, culture and costume. Finally, if you have time to spare, head to the separate building for Southeast Asian exhibits. Do leave time for exploring the gift shop, which sells handicrafts by the different ethnic groups. The best thing about this is that there are lockers at the first level of the buildings, which allow visitors coming from the airport to store their luggages while they tour the grounds. Admission fee is between USD 1~2 and it is a great way to spend an afternoon. The restaurant at the museum provides vocational training for youths with special needs, and dining there was a nice way of filling our stomachs and contributing to the meaningful cause."

Friends highly recommended this museum, but surprisingly it's not listed in the Lonely Planet Vietnam book. It's definitely worth visiting if you have any interest in the Hmong and other peoples.It's quite large, both indoors and outdoors. Indoors is 2 floors of static displays - costumes, implements, art, a house, etc. - with explanations in 3 languages - Vietnamese, French and English. It's all very nicely laid out and spacious.Outside are a number of houses from different tribal regions of Vietnam. You can go into all of them - for some you have to remove your shoes. They're laid out in a very nice garden area. They also have good explanatory plaques.I highly recommend the cafe, Baguette & Chocolat - see my review. It was surprisingly good. And the crafts shop is a non-profit cooperative that has an excellent array of tribal items.I highly recommend this museum for even the casual visitor."

After visiting, I have a little better understanding about the wonderful diversity of this amazingly creative, innovative and energetic nation. I should have visited years ago. Oh, and if you do visit, stop for lunch at the little cafe by the reconstructed village. It's called Baguette Chocolate and served some of the best food I have had in 40 years visiting Vietnam - and I have has some lovely food during that time. The restaurant is run by the Hoa Sua School for disadvantaged youth and they do a wonderful job, well worth of a review on TA where they got 5* from me. Great afternoon out."

There are also several full size dwellings which have been constructed in the grounds - Interesting to learn the differences between houses and the materials used in their construction. I recommend visiting the small cafe in the museum grounds which is run by students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are being trained in hospitality. Good food at reasonable prices and located in a lovely garden surrounds. The museum shop has some excellent, well priced items and relaxed laid back staff allow quiet browsing.

The displays of the many ethnic minorities clothes and way of life was really fascinating and extremely well displayed. My only gripe would be the tour groups that go through monopolise the exhibition spaces by stopping in front of a particular exhibit, blocking other visitors. I think it would be better if an audio guide was offered to these visitors and no tour groups allowed. But that aside we really enjoyed the exhibits and then discovered the architecture garden outside. It was a sunday so there were lots of kids whith their parents great being shown their cultural heritage. The reconstructed original traditional houses were amazing to see, you can walk through them or up into the stilt houses. Theyt show very much how they would have been used. We came away with a great sense of the cultural and architectural heritage of Vietnam. Lunch in the restaurant in the garden was also good, I highly recommend this museum."

The museum is essentially in two parts - an outside folk museum where there are 17 different buildings typifying the different types of houses in the different ages and regions of Vietnam. We found this aspect fascinating. Unfortunately we spent so long in the outdoor folk museum part that we had to rush the second part - which was to see the indoor museum which depicted the different cultures, way of life and dress of the many ethnic groupings that make up the country as we now know it. Understanding the complexities of all the different ethnic groupings is difficult especially if, like us, you are short on time. Well worth a visit, but leave plenty of time to explore it all"

The museum was well curated with great exhibits of tribal art, artefacts and everyday objects gathered from across the nation. The displays are well labelled in Vietnamese, French and English which makes it a very informative trip. If you would like to know about Vietnam, it's people and their culture in greater detail then you will enjoy the museum, which is very educational and interesting.

The information explains in detail the origins, culture and lifestyle of each group and so you can really get a good picture of the varied human landscape of Vietnam. This makes it an ideal stop off for anyone thinking of heading to Sapa and the North. For me, the highlight is the architectural garden which presents about 20 examples of domestic architecture from the various peoples and if you have children they will absolutely love it, especially the stilt house which reaches over 19 metres in height! At around 16:00 there's also a water puppet show which shows short plays and if you haven't seen a water puppetry show yet, this is an ideal time to do so.

It's a bit hidden among the trees but there is about a dozen reconstructed buildings (some huge, some small huts) from different ethnic groups. You can enter them and have a look for yourself - some require a bit of a climb so wear good shoes.If you're going to Sa Pa while in Vietnam, try to visit this museum first. It enriched our stay in Sa Pa as we understood the ethnic groups better and had learnt about e.g. the H'mong people who live there."

The museum of Ethnology is probably the largest that we saw in Hanoi and documents the ethnology - cultural origins, housing, lifestyle, etc of the people of Vietnam. There are large pictoral hoardings of the tribes and their homes in addition to an array of items that they use in their day to day life including some of the metal products, clothing etc. The exterior lends itself to the various types of houses. We visited the museum late in the afternoon and by then there was really nothing available to drink or eat at the standalone restaurant that was basic and dirty. The museum shop was small and obscure and did not really have very interesting souvenirs or products. Its a visit that you can make if you have lots of time but don't recommend it if you want to see the city in a limited time frame. There are a lot more interesting places in Hanoi like the Old quarter, the sunken sword lake, the ceramic and silk villages that you can visit which are far more interesting and different and also give you an idea of the culture of the city."

The main building houses a collection of artifacts and displays from Vietnams various montagnard and indigenous minorities, which are pretty much what you would expect (I should add the main building could use some sound-absorbing ceilings - even with small numbers of people the sound reverbs make it very loud). But the real attraction are several acres of buildings out back which are full-size village buildings, each actually built by people from each region, which you can walk through. I should also add that the restaurant on the museum grounds is excellent. It was founded as a non-profit culinary school by several retired Vietnamese teachers, and we ended up having one of the most pleasant lunches of our entire stay in Hanoi there"

When we visited it was on at 10am, 11:30am and 2pm. It's well worth watching.The museum is not close to any other attractions so we caught a taxi there. You get better value if you book one from your hotel. The exhibits have English descriptions as well as Vietnamese so you won't have difficulty understanding their meaning.If the weather is bad take a coat as the exhibition is both indoors and outdoors. The outdoor exhibits include different houses of the Vietnamese People, which are either replicas or have been dismantled and then reconstructed at the museum. They are really interesting. It's worth noting that you need to take your shoes off to enter most of these houses and that some climbing of steps is required.This museum is definitely worth the trek and will set you up with the knowledge needed to make the most of your travels through Vietnam."

The main building has a nice flow through main and upper levels, though stairs are required, and generally portrays well unique and interesting aspects of each ethnic group that occupies the territory of present day Vietnam. Clothing, economy, housing, religion, family and social structure are mentioned, and generally well portrayed with a combination of artifacts, diaramas and video. The external grounds with housing and lifestyle displays complement the interior displays, allowing one to better imagine living in a stilt house, or cooking in a sandbox stove inside a highly flammable house. The grounds also have a nice flow from one area to the next. The piece that is missing here is any sense of \"living displays\" as is the norm in other such museums around the world.The museum also has some special exhibition spaces, a smaller one in the main building, currently featuring photos from a highlands area taken in the1950s and stunningly displayed, and the much larger and very nice Southeast Asian building which is fairly new, and houses an interesting array of Asian artifacts and some rotating displays, currently a special exhibit of Indonesian glass art.A museum-goer will find a lot to enjoy here; children can be engaged, and the trilingual displays make the material more accessible to anglo- or francophones. Overall, a very enjoyable experience that continues to engage and educate, and is moving towards world-standards for such."

My time at the Museum of Ethnography mirrored a few books that I have read about this and was an entreaty into the lives of many people whom most people who visit Viet Nam would overlook. I have been fortunate to have been among a number of these ethnicities in their own locale. I was in their homes, their pagodas, their churches and temples. I have been with them as they revered those before them, prayed for the lives of their families and friends and looked at the historic places among which they live. I have been invited to ring bells, taught by monks and had a LOT of tea with monks at so many pagodas and even at their monasteries.The Museum of Ethnograhy actually gives you a true experience of life in the \"countryside\" as they call it. From the farthest reaches to the north with Black Thais, Hmong and Black Hmong and so on all the way south of HCMC, one can get it all right here. You can see how some people still live in Viet Nam. You can get a feel for their lives and their sense of family that holds them together and makes them strong. Hey, you don't need to memorize them all. I certainly can't. However, you will love this place, walking around, going into actual models of homes all over Viet Nam, seeing how people live and wondering about how their lives go on and what they are doing today. Look at the clothes, look how hot it is in one place and cold in another and how that affects what they make and what they wear. This is a memorable peek into the lives of so many. I hightly recommend it. By the way, most materials are in English . . . You won't be lost."

I took about 2-3 hours, slowly reading the many exhibits of the various minority groups in Vietnam. There's information on the history of the tribes, their customs, and the exterior of the museum even had replicas of the houses the minority groups live in. Apparently, these replicas use the same types of wood and other building materials that the various minority groups would use to build their houses.Do note that it's about a 30 minute bus ride away from the Old Quarters. I took a public bus (bus 14) from the famous Ho Hoan Kiem (aka Ho Guom, the most famous lake by the Old Quarters). You'd have to walk a short distance to the museum from where you alight as well. If you're unsure of how to get there via public transport, you can always get your hotel/hostel to book a cab for you. It shouldn't cost you too much."

There is very little explanation of most of the artefacts e.g. next to the ornamental knife, the sign just says \"knife\". It does not give any indication of governance, rule of law, society structure; cooking techniques, education and religion are dealt with superficially. So, one is left with no real \"feel\" of what the various ethnic groups sympathies or pathos lies.

The outside displays are interesting because you can enter right into the homes set up on the property. The inside displays are a bit less interesting and aren't worth the trip on their own.The major downfall of the museum is it is a long taxi ride from the old quarter and the taxi fees far outweigh the cost of admission."

The indoor museum contains too many information, not a bad thing but very easy to get tired in the middle way. I think it might be nicer if they can do a bit blending between \"indoor information\" and \"outdoor experiments\".The products of ethnic groups selling in the boutique are nice; if you don't plan to search on the street for the \"real ethnic hand-made\" good, this is a good choice. There's a cafe located in the museum but we didn't see any outside the museum as it was located on a big street where many governmental buildings (?) addressed.The location is a bit far from the old quarter. there are buses stations in front of the museum, but we took our hotel's advise to take taxi there, which caused about 6 USD."

Bus arrived within 3 minutes and was cool and comfortable. The bus dropped us virtually outside the front door. Inside were wonderful precious relics all well labeled but a bit dusty even those in glass cases. We left the main hall after about 30 minutes and proceeded to the garden cafe/restaurant for a coffee and from there to the fascinating exhibits of village huts. I would say that this was almost the best part.. one gets a better idea of village life of different ethnic groups. Walking in the shade under tree lined pathways was a highlight of our visit. We then went onto the new building and marvelled at the many well preserved and well looked after new displays. The building has tall ceilings with lots of glass and concrete. The display of shadow puppets was enjoyable. We were quite weary at this stage so left for our return journey by bus. A very enjoyable 3 hours which can be recommended."

So many different sub tribal cultures make up the population here that it's difficult to keep count. There are displays on cultural ceremonies from funeral traditions to all female thanksgiving ceremonies. I watched the process of making and dying hemp fabric with fascination. Nearly all exhibits have English translations of their information boards which helped me a lot.In the grounds there are fullscale recreations of traditional village buildings. There is a long house and a tall house (a village building for ceremonial whose height gave the village status); a bamboo hydro power plant has been recreated near a water puppet auditorium. A restaurant in the grounds is a training centre for catering students. Service was slow but the project laudible."

Ask the conductor for the Ngha Tan bus stop - I wrote it down as they have trouble understanding my poor pronunciation. I also told him that I was going to the Museum of Ethnology. I asked the conductor to tell me when I was at the stop and he did - also pointed me in the general direction of the Museum.2 When you get off the bus (this is on a main road named Hoang Quoc Viet), turn around, take a deep breath and cross the road and walk slightly to the right to a laneway named Pho To Hieun.3 Walk down Pho To Hieun to the end (less than 100m), turn left at the end and walk to the end of this (about 30m) till you come to another main road - D Nguyen Van Huyan.4 At the main road (do not cross yet) turn right and walk down until you come to a walking crossover bridge. Walk up this, across the other side, and when you walk down the steps you are nearly at the Museum entrance.Coming back1 Walk back the same way but at the end do not cross over the main road. There is a bus stop about 10m to your left from the end of Pho To Hieu.2 Catch the No14 bus back - NB it does not go back to Long Bien Central Station, but to the Old Quarter and if you stay on till the end it stops at Hoan Kiem Lake.Information supplied at the museum says you can catch bus numbers 2,12,13,38,39 and 60 as well but I don't know where they stop."

We had already been to Sapa and met some of the Hmong villagers so we were particularly interested in them. The indoor museum is sectioned off into the different minorities with information, photos and displays relevant to each of them. Very interesting and educational. However, it was outside that the real WOW factor kicks in. There are about 7 or 8 actual houses from a few of the different minorities which you can walk through and around - they are fabulous constructions and just show the ingenuity of these peoples, using the materials that are most available to them in their location. Allow about 3 hours between indoor and outdoor sections. There is a lovely restaurant on-site and it is a training restaurant for disadvantaged kids so it's well worth supporting that (and the food was lovely). This is a MUST SEE location in Hanoi. It is about 5 miles from the centre of town but it doesn't take long by taxi. We paid 110,000 dong to get out by taxi (booked by our hotel) and on the way back we went up to one of the waiting taxi's and he said 120,000 to get back into the city so no haggling required there. The museum is only about 40,000 Dong to get in - unbelievable value for what you get."

I recommend wearing slip on shoes or sandals as many of the houses require you to take off your shoes to enter, so it will save time fussing with laces. Excellent experience climbing in and around the different structures. No need for a guide. It can get a bit crowded so budget some time to wait and let tour groups pass through."

When we got outside there are a series of houses you can go in of the different types found in Vietnam and the kids really enjoyed being able to go in an wander about. In a couple of them there were videos of them being built which was interesting. The restaurant is a training restaurant and I feel bad reviewing it poorly as clearly the staff are learning but it was one of the few bad meals we had in Hanoi. I would probably use it for a drink and then go elsewhere for food. There was a fair trade type museum shop on the way out and lots of taxis outside to get back to the hotel- negotiate the fare before you get in. They are metered but sometimes the meters seem to have a mind of their own. We needed things to do to keep the kids interested in Hanoi and this was worth a visit."

My favourite exhibit was the bicycle of the Red River valley fish trap salesman, who carried 800 traps on his bike. There is a phto to prove it, as well. The actual bicycle with traps. Outside, they have erected houses of various tribes, which are very interesting to see and walk through. The cafe is used to train disadvantaged students in hospitality, and while they haven't all mastered the trade, the food was good and reasonably priced.

To begin with, the place is huge - with an indoor and outdoor exhibit. The indoor exhibit is a 2 floor building with separate exhibits dedicated to each major language/ethnic group in Vietnam detailing their origin, houses, livelihoods, rituals, festivities, musical instruments, clothing, beliefs and many more. The various types of houses were reconstructed in the outdoor exhibit. We were allowed to enter and explore each house which was the most fun part of our experience at the museum. Spent about 4 hours. If you want a tour guide, the museum provides one (which costs a lot more). Wear footwear which you can easily remove and put back on. To enter the houses in the outdoor exhibit, you would have to keep removing your footwear. Shoes would be very tiresome in this situation. Overall, this place gets a 10/10"

We went with our HanoiKids.org guides. One of which had briefly worked at the museum and had a great understanding of the story of the people. We spent time understanding the various housing styles and other unique aspects of the people. Vietnam is so named because the vast majority of its citizens are from the Viet tribal group.We went on a Sunday and there were several school groups visiting on field trips from out of town. Several young 8 or 9 year olds approached us in English and asked us many questions. Our guides were astounded at the skill these young children had with both the language and there forwardness towards strangers. It was exciting to speak with some of Vietnams future leaders."

The exhibitions are of good international standard and are captioned in Vietnamese, French and English. There are examples of artefacts, clothing, tools, implements, customs, ways of living. Videos help you to envisage the life of the people. Outside are reconstructions of different types of traditional housing.In the same complex is a Museum about SE Asia generally \u2013 less interesting, less than half full, but worth a visit too.

There are interesting stories to learn about the different ethnic groups, including their history, where they come from, where they live, how they live and what their rituals are. The museum is split in two parts:- inside you can learn about the history of the people, see what they wear, learn about their customs and rituals. - outside there are 10 real houses of some of the ethnic groups. You can go inside and see how the houses are structured and how the different groups live. There is a possibilitybto take a tour guide, who will take you for about 40 minutes inside the museum and explain more. However, we had a guide and were very disappointed by her stories. She did not say anything new compared to what is already written inside the museum, but she actually missed some interesting facts and her English was very hard to understand at times. So I would recommend saving the 100000VDN you would spend for the guide and just go in by yourself."

The indoor displays of the museum is really impressive. From the photo exhibits taken in 1950's up the late 2000. The educational or rather the detailed descriptions and each Ethnic groups are truly amazing. They described from culture, beliefs and religion. So much information and i must that i truly enjoyed the visit even when i was alone. After my over an hour tour inside the museum, i went outdoor. It was really exciting and beautiful. You can visit the actual scenery of the minorities, you will see how they built their houses, their fishing boats, etc.. After going around the outdoor museum, i went back and bought myself one book about the Ethnic Groups in Vietnam. Overall, my visit to the museum was really fulfilling and wonderful. I cant describe how happy i am because discovering the diversity of Vietnam is something that i wanted to see. For me, as ASEAN most of the traditions and cultures are like... deja vu.. BEAUTIFUL! Lastly, they also have coffee shop where i enjoyed so much my coffee (after my two and half hours walking...) and small store for shopping. Check the shopping store, they have few collections of good scarf and native bags."

The museum is essentially two museums -- exhibits in the traditional style inside, and an outdoor exhibit of traditional buildings/homes, most or all of which are authentic -- dismantled and brought in from places around Vietnam. The traditional indoor museum is probably worth a few minutes, but exhibits seemed mostly old, tired, ill-thought-out and lacking in real interest. This may have been an artifact of the extreme heat, we were there on a very hot day, and it was notably hotter inside than out. But really, I am pretty sure this would have been a speed-through museum even without the heat. Would have rated it \"Poor\" if that were all there was to this museum.But the outdoor part of the museum was fascinating to me -- even if almost as hot (and if you can't take the heat, of course, what are you doing in SEA?) Seeing, and in many cases climbing up and into, the dozen or so traditional houses from around the country was fascinating, and I can see it being of interest to children if you happen to be toting any around with you. It would be nice if there was a little more information, and a little more in the way of associated artifacts with the buildings, but still, it was an interesting time to poke and clamber around there.Museum gift shop is worth a stop, small but we found some interesting items that remind us of the folk history of Vietnam."

They have great in-house guides who will show us around the house of each ethnicity and give insightful explanations on each items and the rituals/customs of the people. What makes this museum outstanding from the rest is their regular events which enable visitors to experience culture in a more profound way (traditional festivals 3-4 times a year, plus other shows and exhibitions like water puppet shows, temporary gallery, traditional clothes exhibition, etc....). The outdoor spaces for the last few years have been neglected obviously. There used to be better care for those back in 2010 and earlier (because the general manager of the museum back then was Mr. Huy, also the founder of the museum so he was much dedicated to taking the best care of every corner of it). Now the racks or ponds are way too dry, lots of outdoor items are covered with dirt or got broken. I hope the museum will do something about this soon."

The museum had a great photography exhibit and several actual homes that had been relocated to the museum for display. My favorite display was the old bicycle with hundreds of fish baskets strapped to it for market. Definitely, wear comfortable shoes and clothing as you will be climbing up tall wooden ladders and walking on surprisingly sturdy thin bamboo slatted floors."

The information inside the museum was very detailed (almost too much detail at times), but all of the displays were interesting and the items on display were in good condition. What made the museum special though were the traditional tribal houses built in the outside gardens of the museum. There were about 8 of them that were full sized and you could go inside to see how people live in tribal areas of Viet Nam. I would highly recommend this museum to anyone planning a trip to Sa Pa. The information here gave me a much deeper understanding and experience of the villages I visited there."

I thought National museums are meant to be air conditioned to preserve to the displays - well in Hanoi it isn't and its stinking HOT. We went to the S.E.

It is about 20 minutes/$5 cab ride from the center of the city so you need to set aside time for the trip (about a half day). When you enter, it isn't really clear how the museum is laid out. It becomes evident as you circle around that different sections focus on different ethnic groups and are then sub-divided into: cooking, musical instruments, religions, customs, burial rights, hunting, agriculture, jewelry and clothing. Once you become aware of that, it's really interesting to compare each ethnic group's customs. Outside are the model houses. I am not sure what my expectation was, but there was not much besides the houses you could walk into--they were for the most part not decorated. I can see that this place would be interesting for people only staying in Hanoi, but after traveling the country for the past two weeks, I had seen examples of these structures in my travels."

The inside exhibits consisting of examples of tools, clothing, religious artifacts, musical instruments etc.is also well worththe visit. In fact you could devote a whole day here with a very good cafe run by trainee hospitality students providing a welcome break. Don't miss it if you really want to understand Vietnam."

I sometimes came back there but I didn't take any photo, just enjoyed the nature and went around to see the exhibited items. The museum organize different activites every month. It's always crowded with children on Mid-autumn festival (or Full Moon festival on Aug 15th Lunar Calendar). They taugh children how to make Vietnamese traditional lanterns, Star Lights, t\u00f2 he..

You can also (usually) let your kids run all over the place and 'discover' things on their own. The setting is very quiet which I appreciated after being in the heart of the busy city for most of my stay. Bring an umbrella to help keep the heat at bay. It really does make a difference to help you from getting overheated. The buildings are all accessible but for a few, you have to be willing to climb stairs and/or negotiate a ladder of sorts, therefore some of the buildings are not accessible to everyone. I noticed in a few other posts that people were disappointed that the museum wasn't \"interactive\" but considering that the setting shows \"how it used to be\" and Vietnam is basically second and mostly third world, what do you expect? There are not people dressed up in costume weaving or storytelling, or things for tourists to play with. It's straight up, here's the living conditions of what used to be, and for some ethnic minorities, life as it still exists. My family and I found it interesting and most definitely worth the visit. We got a good laugh at the burial house. When you see the statues, you will know it wasn't insensitive for us to laugh out loud! It shows that the Vietnamese had a sense of humor."

The Ethnology museum on the inside is filled with relics, artifacts, and tons of information on the different ethnic groups today that currently live in Vietnam,but that's only the beginning. On the outside are a bunch of houses that are replicas of the type that the ethnic group typically lives in, which you can take your time to see and for some, go in. The museum also has a nice restaurant with traditional food and some shops. The Ethnology Museum is amazing and one of if not the best museum I've been to."

At is a big museum with a lot of outdoor activities for children and many houses that are rebuild in the museum park. And not just rebuild, they are not copies. The Nh\u00e0 r\u00f4ng, a big community house is built by the ethnic group itself, just as it would be built in their own community including the offer of a bull when it was ready.When you travel in Vietnam, you will be surprised how welcome you are. The doors are always open and when you make a gesture that you want to come in: they will invite you very friendly to do so.What you see in this museum: the open doors, that\u2019s the real Vietnam, especial in small villages: when you enter the houses in the museum, it feels special, it is special but that\u2019s Vietnam. I myself love music. When I hear somewhere music I want to see it. In the old quarter there\u2019s a street with funeral\u2019s. I often visit them because I love the music. They always invite me and to have tea with them. In the museum there\u2019s also a beautiful small construction. My Vietnamese friends wanted to have a picture of them in front of it till I told them it was a construction for a coffin. Immediately thy jumped away, because even in the museum you have to be careful and respectful with everything that is about death.Inside the museum there\u2019s also lot to see\u2026 The best is to come back every year, read a bit about Vietnam and every time you\u2019ll find new things in this museum."

It is also the most dimly lit museum I have ever visited , with such bad lighting it can be difficult to see some of the exhibits properly. Outside, there are lots of re-created tribal houses of different shapes and styles . The staff on duty in the various dwellings seems to consist solely of giggling schoolchildren surrounded by schoolbooks but glued to their mobile phones. Worth a few hours"

The best bit was the outdoor area where you could view various full scale homesteads and walk around in them. We were lucky enough to see a small photography exhibition whilst we were there - added to the charm of our visit. Definitely a must do."

Really enjoyed my visit here, so much to see and learn about all the different ethnic groups, but even rather odd displays like 'the basket seller's bike' can leave you with a broad smile. I was rather impressed about the new South East Asia wing / building, which at time of my visit only had an exhibition at ground level. Nice, modern and spacious, this will hopefully be filled in the months / years to come. Very much recommended"

It would be helpful if you've read up briefly some history of the country and its region to be able to strike some form of correlation to better understand the cultural influence. There are just too many names to remember so what helped was a map of the place and use it to navigate as you walk through the whole place. You'll also get to appreciate their way of living and the value of food and kitchen. Traditional ceremonies is also something they value alot.Next to this main museum of the ethnic minority (the majority of Vietnamese are known as Kinh), is the museum on South East Asia. It's not as big but very modern by itself and helped to bring together the diversity of the region in a rather structural manner. A good basic introduction. Walking through it, apart of appreciating the diversity, you can try to draw the connection on what are the similarities of the region. There is a second floor that focuses on Indonesia alone. A much smaller exhibit that uses glass painting to share more about the culture.The first has limited air conditioned facilities (available only on the first floor) so I'd suggest to bring a towel, especially if you perspire easily. Whereas the second is fully air conditioned."

Some visitors to the country avoid this time as transport etc can be restricted but if you have friends there it can be a great time to visit).Our guide did not point out (probably as there was not enough time schedule) that there is an outside park area where houses of diverse ethnic groups have been built that can be entered as well as those constructed inside the building. There are English and French translations with the interpretation materials alongside the exhibits. This is a well organised museum with a good book shop and there are regular demonstrations of traditional arts including educational activities for children such as weaving, printing etc. LIft to upper floor.There is much to see.

This Museum has a spacious property and a separate building for special exhibits. It doesn't feel cramped and there wasn't much people traffic, other than a cute class of kindergartens on a field trip. The indoor exhibits are interesting, but the life-sized native huts and buildings outside are more interesting. They cancelled their 10am water puppet show in their outdoor theater due to the weather (unsure about their exact daily schedules). You will have to remove your shoes prior to entering the huts, so I recommend wearing sandals for convenience.We had walking tour guides (see Hanoi Free tour guides) with us and that made the visit more meaningful as they were able to add important info and answer our queries about the exhibits and the traditional culture. This trip took us about 3hrs."

It was great to learn about where all of the different people came from and during what time period. They had interesting displays and the signs were written well in English and very informative. I thought the traditional houses outside were fascinating. There were quite a few, and I could tell a lot of work went into constructing them. The grounds were really nice with pathways, gardens, and trees. There is a newer building across from the museum with art and traditional clothing from other South East Asian countries also. This was a smaller exhibit but also interesting and well put together. The entrance fee was only 40k vnd, so it was well worth it. Some people complained about it being far away, and though it is about six kilometers from the old quarters, our taxi was only 74k vnd each way. That means the whole trip for two people was about $7. We were at the museum for over four hours because there is so much to see and read, so it was worth the price for us."

While we were visiting, there was a group of very good looking young military officers also visiting - who told us they were from South Korea...Charming young men who practiced their English by speaking with us.The outdoor exhibits are hands-on and allow the visitor to step inside the various types of houses to look around. The building that contains the costumes and artifacts is a delightful space built around a central courtyard with multiple vantage points on a couple of levels. Please note that photos can only be taken when you buy a camera pass that costs a couple of dollars. This practice is much more common in the mid-east, and I saw little of it in Vietnam. I didn't bother.Just outside the main building is a small, but very good book shop and across near the entrance is a very fine gift shop with clothing, bags, very nice spoons and serving pieces made of horn, and framed textiles. I bought some very nice things here."

We had lunch there and it was very very good, and at quite reasonable prices. There is a water puppet show free of charge. I did not think much of it.

The good relationship of Vietnam with other countries like Norway, etc. were shown in the well-maintained houses and structures built around the grounds of the museum. The building housing the Southeast Asia relics, traditional costumes and other paraphernalia seems to still have ample space for other materials that may be exhibited to the public. The buildings showing the culture of the various ethnic groups were airy and had benches/stools to sit on if one wants to view an audio visual presentation or if one gets tired of coming up the stairs or roaming around.The only thing that marred my visit there was the foul smell that emanated from the restroom at the ground floor; otherwise, my rating would have been excellent."

If you are planning a trek in the Sapa area to visit various minority ethnic tribes, this is an especially useful and interesting introduction to the various ethnicities that call Vietnam home. Everything is well labeled in multiple languages. The grounds include examples of of traditional houses. It's not a huge museum and won't take that long to go thru, but I thought it one of the best and most informative sites in Hanoi."

My friends and I came to this museum on a Saturday afternoon, hearing that it was the best museum in Hanoi. It did not disappoint. The exhibits are well-presented, and in the garden in the back there are many relocated houses from Vietnam's ethnic communities. I could imagine that this would be fun for families. I wish I had more time to read everything carefully, as after a day of museum-going I was a bit over-saturated. I'd recommend seeing the garden first, and then the central museum, and if you don't have time the Southeast Asian hall is not really necessary. Note that there is a decent museum cafe with Vietnamese standards, as well as a branch of CraftLink, in case you'd like to buy arts and crafts afterwards."

Take time (2 min.- 3 hours) to visit it inside and outside (many bamboo and wooden huts outside in the park) - I recommend that you take a guide to help you through your visit to better understand what stands behind the things displayed; we did not stop at each one of them, but it seems that our guide took us to the most interesting ones, and of course helped us for other less striking pictures or things that we asked him about. We went there by taxi from downtown for a couple of dollars. We enjoyed our visit all the more given the pouring rain outside"

We had the curator or his assistant give us a private tour and although she was very kind and nice there was a huge language barrier as she understood very little english. She had a rehearsed speel and when gotten off course it just didnt work. I ended up reading the plakards to answer questions asked by our friends. More than once we told her we were ready to just go to the outside exhibits, she would shake her head yes in agreement then move to the next exhibit on her list! It became rather commical !!One of our group was able to escape and we found her sitting down stairs \"waiting\" on us!!I guess if we had gone through on our own I would give this experience a higher rating but I still have a sour taste after the two hour tour of trying to figure out what she was saying on her pre planned non waivered semi english tour. I am pretty good at broken english and I could not keep up. At one point she told us something that my husband was interested in and I had smiled and said yes or cool like I understood her so we cold move on and he said in front of her \"what was that she said?\" I gave him a look like please be quiet then when we turned told him not to ask me because I am just agreeing with her with out understanding half of it so we can be done!."

The museum relocated a variety of buildings from around the country, and you can walk into them to get a feel for how it was (or is, since many of these housing types are still in use) to live in them. Kids will enjoy climbing up into the raised houses and feeling the bounce of the bamboo flooring.One note: the museum shop is excellent. Many of the items are produced by cooperatives and other supportive organizations, not souvenir factories. This was one our first stops in Vietnam, and I didn't know what we'd find elsewhere, so I only bought a few scarves and a hand-painted greeting card. In retrospect, wish I'd loaded up here. No pressure, no bargaining, low, fair prices, and they take US$ and credit cards."

We could not be happier as our guide, Nhi, was the curator for education and had actually visited the villages, collected the artifacts, and helped set up the exhibits. The knowledge she provided was simply incredible and it was very interesting to learn how the communities have changed over her time visiting. Would absolutely recommend for your time in Hanoi and booking a guide directly with the museum for more insight into the cultures of the country. One of our favorite days here in Vietnam."

The exhibits are typically labeled in three languages including French and English although they could be more informative a very old hand made rifle just has Rifle written against it rather than its age, who made it, used by etc etc. There are other exhibits if habitation in the grounds and a newly constructed building containing Southern Asia exhibits of pictures on glass and garments."

The exhibits are well-curated and of excellent quality -- and each interpretive display has translations in French and English. The main building is shaped like a traditional bronze Vietnamese drum, and has two levels that contain great information on all of the ethnic groups in Viet Nam. I especially enjoyed the life-sized dioramas that depicted the traditional activities, as well as the expertly-crafted miniatures of boats, houses, etc. as well.In the large outdoor area behind the museum building, you will find examples of the traditional houses used in different parts of the country. These have been moved from their original locations & re-assembled at the museum, or are replicas constructed by the craftsman from the respective regions... seeing and walking through each of these was like taking a trip across Viet Nam :)) Take the time to sit inside these houses, and imagine them filled with folks engaged in their ceremonies, daily activities, etc. (Hint: the guides take people at a brisk pace through these, and so you might want to walk through & enjoy them again after the tour is concluded).Not to be missed is the famous Water Puppet show, performed in the outdoor theater (complete with musicians and narrators)... I was really pleased to be able to see this marvelous art form again (having already viewed the show at the indoor theater in the Old Quarter) -- and the lighting was much better here (making for better photos/videos). Be sure to find out about the performance schedule and visit when these are taking place.The museum gift shop is operated by the non-profit Craft Link organization, and has excellent quality handicrafts at reasonable prices (w/o the hassle of bargaining too). The crafters are given \"fair trade\" prices for their very nice works, and so a purchase here will benefit them well... There are a range of prices for items small to large, so it's easy to find something that you can afford :))Enjoy my favorite Ha Noi museum!"

If you come to Hanoi with the intention of going to Sapa or another \"hill tribe\" area, come here first and learn about the people and their culture - it will really add another dimension to your trip. There is a large outdoor area in addition to the main exhibits in the museum. Here, you can see the different houses that people live in, go inside and explore. This is informative for adults and lots of fun for the kids too. Though the museum is located a few kilometers from the city center, it's definitely worth making the trip. If you don't want to take a taxi (about $5 or $6 from the Old Quarter), you can also take a public bus there."

It took me about an hour and a half to walk through the museum, but I keep a fast pace when I visit museums.Also, there's a gift shop and restaurant onsite, and it's easy to grab a taxi out front (to get you back to the city center).

They have about 18 structures around the grounds to demonstrate the architectural styles of various Vietnamese ethnic groups, most of which were purchased from actual villages and people from the group were hired to come and assemble the structures at the museum, so they are quite authentic, and truly beautiful buildings. And you can walk around inside them! The displays inside the museum are also very interesting--even our kid thought so! But the highlight of our visit (according to the kid) was the water puppet show...we had to see it twice!"

We spend so much time on the grounds that we had a limited amount of time to view the interior.The interior museum building housed artifacts, clothing, work tools and other items used in their day to day lives. There was also a special (Nguyen) historical photography exhibit on display. There are restrooms, elevators in addition storage lockers located at the back of the museum.

Like some of the other museums and historical sites around Vietnam, you are shown what they want you to see. I was dismayed at how indigenous peoples have been marginalised to 'minority' status and their histories re-written to make them seem primitive. A visit to the M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n temples will quickly teach you that the Champa people were not merely the 'pirates' that were described by one of my tour guides.I encourage you to explore this museum, especially the garden with the indigenous/'minority' houses.

Understand why Vietnamese people thinking on a different way than other country (like the importance of family relation). The Vietnamese culture is not easy to understand for foreigners because the history of Vietnam is complicate. This museum his like a tool to allow you to know more Vietnamese people. The conception of the museum is perfectly built and allow you to understand easily all without be lost.

By Western standards, it was a little dull for my 10yr old and 8 yr old inside as it was lots of looking, and I was sad to see other Western kids being allowed to manhandle the exhibits by their parents.Outside the building was the real highlight of the museum. There are many buildings outside to explore, which are different types of houses from different ethnic groups. A fantastic job inside of recreating how the houses would be in the rural areas, although it was a little daunting watching the kids climb up the thin ladders into the high community hall...and scary trying to climb back down! Those steps are steep!!!One of the highlights of Hanoi for us. Allow at least 3 hours."

There is also a Southeast Asian building on the right as you enter the grounds with mostly handicrafts of SE Asian peoples.

I like those. I wish my country has a similar museum devoted to our own tribes.If I have to gripe about something it would be about the large wooden map you will encounter near the entrance. It is difficult to read. I had no idea how to interpret it and I cannot exactly pinpoint where we are on it. It has no signs of where we should begin and where we should go next.

Everything is very well explained in english. Outside you can find a garden where typical houses for all ethnic groups are rebuild. From what we have heard the museum hired people from the specific ethnic groups to build the houses on site using original building materials. As such they are replica's but very close to the original houses. You can enter all of them.We only had about 2 hours to visit which was too short in my opinion.

The museum consists of indoor exhibits over 2/3 floors and an outside space with houses built by ethnic people. I would pay way more than the 40,000vnd entrance fee for the visit. Plus there are free water puppet shows at certainly times at the weekends - not the standard you get from proper performances I suppose but I can tick the box of seeing a water puppet show. For the ethnic houses - they are so many of them. You can enter most of them to see what there living conditions are like. I was very very impressed to see that they could build such waterproof houses in a matter of weeks. Inside each house they play videos of how the museum got the ethnic people to actually come to Hanoi to build the houses and the process of the houses being built. An eye opening experience and the highlight of my trip. Please go - it's about 100,000 taxi ride from the old quarter and well worth a visit."

However, the place that will actually show you the incredible diversity of Vietnam's people that number stands for, is the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology. If you can spare one to three hours - depending on where you stay in Hanoi - and you are interested in Vietnam\u00b4s rich culture, a visit to the museum is well worth not only your time, but your kids' time as well. I took my 9 and 12 year old sons and they enjoyed the visit too. But be prepared: It's huge and it can be quite hot and humid!Basically the complex consists of two areas - an exhibition building and an outdoor exhibition park. Indoors you'll find characterisitic of each ethnic group from colourful costumes, furnitures, tools, weapons and artifacts to photos and videos. The outdoors lives from authentic houses typical for the different groups, some donated by former owners and transported to Hanoi, and a Water Puppet Theatre.If you are taking kids, the latter is quite entertaining for them, so make sure you ask about performance times. Kids will certainly enjoy exploring the houses too, like climbing up some unusual, narrrow and steep stairs. Mine did and also enjoyed the indoor videos. However, having been to quite a lot of museums, they would have appreciated a more kids-interactive exhibition. Having said that, their \"verdict\" for the museum was 'very good'. They learned heaps about Vietnam and its people.Probably the best way to make the most of your visit is to get a guide, so you can take in information while you are looking at the exhibition instead of spending a lot of time reading all the information signs. A plus is the big space of the museum. It does not feel overloaded. A great way to \"debrief\" is having some yummy iced coffee or tea or food in the museum's caf\u00e9 close to the exit before you leave."

It's fascinating to see how these houses, community buildings and tombs are made and feels like quite an honour to be able to look through them all. It's important to leave yourself a good 3 hours or so to go through them all. There are 2 caf\u00e9s, but the one on the left when you're heading into the museum is by far the better one. It got resounding votes of success from my 12 year old and the others I visited with, so definitely take the family. It's super cheap to get in (only 40 000 VND), and well worth it."

You can also meet with an expert from the museum to lend your visit another dimension. If luckily, you can have a waterpuppet show for free in the museum's garden (nearby Kinh's traditional house). I forgot the schedule, but you can easily check with the museum in advance.There are many activities and evens held to attract tourists, especially children (for example full moon festival, kite making, pottery making, Dong Ho painting making...). Almost is free. I luckily took part in Dong Ho painting making and had chance to see water puppet show at noon, and it was great experience.I highly recommend tourists to visit this museum to understand about Vietnamese culture in general.

The exhibition is quite huge but still cannot cover every aspects of Vietnam's ethnic groups; however, they did a great job of creating a panorama view of how Vietnamese people and culture are. And I love the humanity in the way they create temporary events to promote people's awareness of social issues or help children/people approach Vietnamese culture through traditional games and products (Games, events for children are often taken place during Lunar New Year, International Children Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival...)Almost forgot, it is one of few places in Vietnam that creates wheelchair access - which very nice and thoughtful."

Inside the main building this is a solid museum with masses of information about the various tribes and ethnicities which inhabit Vietnam - too much, really, as after a while you suffer information overload and it all starts to blur together.Outside, however, the large grounds are full of full-size dwellings from different cultures and time periods, which you can explore and learn about. These really bring the museum to life, and would probably be even better if the information about the tribes was scattered around them so you could digest it a bit easier."

The exhibition building was designed by the architect Ha Duc Linh, a member of the Tay ethnic group, in the shape of a Dong Son drum.It would be great if other countries would appreciate their different ethnic groups with a similar positive perspective.

The displays were mostly relics of the different artifacts from the different ethnic groups, but without much fanfare or pizzaz, if you know what I mean. Then, it started to become interesting when we stepped outside, behind the main building, where all the replica native Vietnamese houses were found. I was amazed at how they built their homes using local materials, and how they structured them. I also liked the garden where the different herbs, vegetables and spices were found, that make up their staple diet. Most of all, make sure to watch the Water puppet show, which already comes with the entrance fee. Not only is it amusing, but it is a lot more expensive if you watch the same show at the theater by Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm lake."

I spent four and a half hours being fascinated at this museum.The best part is the outside reconstruction of different styles of traditional living (love the matrilineal tribes with breast decorations!) behind the main building. Go there first! You walk around and visit Cham, Ede, Viet, etc. houses, communal areas, tombs. It is peaceful (there are some sleeping watchpeople but they do not have a spiel) - the whole architecture is simple wood and bamboo and strikingly austere interiors, with straw mats for bedding and limited privacy in most cases. The high-quality descriptions on the walls (French, English, Vietnames) give a good sense of some of the customs. The exhibits have been developed with support from Nordic countries and France and are world-class. Probably a good introduction to visit tribal areas and unmissable if your itinerary does not allow such a visit. The whole place is peaceful, unrushed, with no tourist folk costume or dance displays.Inside is almost equally wonderful. If nothing else, admire the ceremonial totem pole in the hallway. The two levels are full of costumes, baskets, tools, and good information on important customs and ceremonies (with some video) of the different ethnic groups.I have also visited the Ethnological Museum in Saigon and the Cham museum in Da Nang. This was a favourite by far, although the Cham sculptures are also worth seeing. Nice to see e.g. a Cham house after seeing Cham sculpture in Da nang and Cham ruins in My Son near Hoi An - it all comes together.Tips:One tomb is very explicit - may make you blush!Some of the outside houses may be difficult to enter for those with restricted mobility. The 'staircases' carved out of a log are really fun if you have a head for heights.Toilets outside among the most pristine I have seen in the country. Accessible, too, I think.If it gets too hot, you can head for the over-air-conditioned cafe block near the exit. If you get hungry or need water, there is a reasonable restaurant run by students of a catering/serving school. My pho was a little watered-down but served at the same price as on the street!The museum is not near the lake in the centre of town - you need to take a taxi.The gift shop looked nice but alas it was too late to visit.Would visit again in a flash.

I loved everything about this museum from its rich materials, well displayed exhibits (inside and especially outside), to the tour guide. The three things that the museum could improve are: 1) the air conditioner or at least fan system: There was air conditioner only at the reception hall and there were few fans here and there around the museum. In the summer, it was a torture for both children and adults, especially the children. They couldn't stand the heat, the sweating and thus they couldn't really enjoy the great exhibits or learn much about Vietnamese people and cultures; 2) the discovery room's location and hour: Although the museum opened from 8:30am to 5:30pm, the discovery room closed between 11:30am to 1:30pm and it wasn't officially noticed on the museum's website, door, or brochure. If we had known, we could have planed to visit at the more proper time so the kids could explore the room and had some hand-on experiences. My kids were very excited to go to the discovery room to work on paintings, ceramic, etc. only to learn that it was closed. In addition, the room was on the attic of the museum. You had to climb a very narrow and dark stair way to get to it. In my opinion, the discovery room is as important as any other part of the museum, it should be placed at a better location, not such remote place. Possibly, the discovery room is the best part of the museum to the children. It was such a disappointment here; 3) The stairway: There wasn't any elevator or escalator in the museum. Therefore, it was impossible for the disabled to visit the museum's second floor and it was difficult for families with small children. We visited the museum without the kids' dad so when we climbed up the stairway. I had to make the kids go first and follow them with whole bunch of bags and stroller while still have to looking after them. It was the same thing climbing down, only I had to go first this time with baggage and made the kids follow so that I could probably catch them if they fell."

It has reconstructions of type of long houses, tall houses and other village structures in the gardens and inside you get a very good sense of the ethnic diversity of the country. There are maps of language areas, tribal areas, displays of some amazing traditional crafts and when I went a fabulously displayed exhibition of photos taken in the 1950s. This is a well-thought out museum. Good for kids and adults. Takes about two hours to do and there's a nice cafe there too, which trains kids from disadvantaged homes (well more disadvantaged than most I imagine). Takes about 20m to get to from Old Quarter and costs about 100k dong. I found this a much better museum than the army museum for instance, which really is a middling experience for anyone interested in the Vietnam war."

And the rest of the museum is very traditional in a historical sense, long write-ups accompanied most objects and images. The write-ups were in proper English as well, reviewed before displayed, unlike the numerous museums around the Old Quarter. The series of longhouses outside is fascinating.

The second new building was had a/c, but only one exhibit as it was new. The houses were well worth the visit, they were built according to the traditional ways, and were still functional as we found out, due to the heavy rainfall. There was english and french plaques and a chance to watch videos, however the labels on the exhibits were \"hat, belt, hat, crossbow, women's clothes...\" etc, and the plaques only described the peoples, with little information about the actual exhibits themselves. We ended up eavesdropping on several guided groups to find out more information about (for example) what each hat represented, or how things were created and used. You could definitely go exploring the place yourself, but I would recommend getting a guide if you want a full experience."

Despite being in the middle of Hanoi the exhibits and surrounding trees and rivers make you feel as though you are in the country side, it truly is as close to authentic as it gets.There is a lot of english, and few people which made it all the more peaceful to roam around and explore these amazing buildings.This was my favourite museum in Vietnam, would happily come back next time."

There is also an outside area where members of each ethnic minority have been invited to construct a house in the style typical to different groups.

But it's pennies really. It may not be to everyone's taste, but on our 2nd day in Vietnam was a great way to learn a little about the culture and history. We did go on a lovely sunny day, which probably makes a difference. Nice grounds, well laid out. I'd say definitely worth a couple of hours of your day."

All of the buildings are open for you to wander around and this gives a fascinating insight into traditional tribal living in Vietnam; some of which is still practiced today.The second key exhibit is an indoor collection of clothing, tools etc. from the various ethnic groups of Vietnam and an explanation as to their origins and history of immigration in Vietnam.The museum is clearly well maintained and the exhibits are all of a really high standard.Aside from the building exhibits and indoor exhibits there are puppet shoes, cafes etc. and other tourist attractions on site."

It was surprisingly graphic in places, and just seemed out of place in this particular museum.The examples of ethnic houses outside are by far the most interesting thing here and definitely worth a look, but a quick whizz round in an hour would have been enough for me!

On the inside there were many displays showing how these people lived their daily lives.

The museum is well labelled and takes the visitors through the different ethnic people that make up Vietnam. It shows via photos, demonstrations, exhibits, artifacts and panoramas the life styles of the ethnic Vietnamese from the top to the bottom of Vietnam. It makes one realise how diverse the cultures are in Vietnam - but intermingled from province to province.There was also a section devoted to children and sex education. It is very explicit and there appeared to be a number of teenagers taking a great deal of time in this section. We were told that this section houses temporary exhibitions and it changes its theme from time to time.After exiting the museum building, the surrounding parkland has a number of ethic house reconstructions scattered through it. The grounds have a couple of cafe/restaurants to refresh oneself (it was extremely hot on the day we visited), and the always present shop selling arts and crafts. It appears to be a good destination for locals and their children judging by the number of people visiting."

Caught up in the periphery have been the hill tribes on the Cambodian / Lao border.This museum provides a terrific insight into the diversity of cultures that make up the fabric of Vietnam.Knowing something of the history of the French and American wars I was also aware that some of these groups were indifferent to the unification objective and some sided with the losing side, so I do wonder what became of them. I saw no mention for example of the Monignards.That aside this museum is a very good quality presentation of the way of life of these tribes.The thing I found most fascinating were the houses constructed in the grounds. Some were simply stunning in their functionality and the techniques used in construction. They were all off the ground and generally incorporated features that promoted airflow Reality was less impressive when we got to Sa Pa and visited a Hmong village which exhibited the impact of poverty and a changing environment. Folks lived on the ground rather than above it and the structures although solid, were windowless and dark airless places. Perhaps it is a reflection of declining control over their environment and economy as their land and lifestyle is being enroached upon by the new Vietnam as ethnic Viets buy up surrounding land.All that aside though the Museum is a great place to inform one's grasp of Vietnam's ethnic diversity."

To give this place credit, where credit's due: it is educational and has some interesting aspects, but I did feel that I could have got this from searching the internet. Others in our small group enjoyed it more than visiting a temple, but I just found it boring. Models of the houses alongside photographs. Some ethnic minority costumes in cabinets basically sums it up. I was also biased as we were lucky enough to be spending 4 weeks in Vietnam and seeing a lot of the exhibits over the course of the trip up close and more personal than visiting this museum."

We're not much for museums, but this one really helped us understand the history of the Vietnamese people. In the following days as we toured villages outside Hanoi and later Sapa, Ha Long, and Hue, we were able to refer back to what we'd seen here. I feel like we gained a greater appreciation for the traditional lifestyle that is still very much alive in the rural parts of the country. The exhibits were excellent, comprehensive, and most importantly if you don't have a guide: translated into English! It then continues outside, where there are a dozen or so example traditional homes as built by people in different parts of the country. We visited on a weekend day, and so at the time they were inhabited by members of the tribes which they represented.Really interesting and ought to be a stop on any trip, especially if you plan to travel up to Sapa or visit any of the other smaller villages."

I were very excited in getting information and knowledge about that. If you are lucky, you can get water puppet show outdoor at weekend noon under great performance.

But outside there are groups of authentic buildings that have been taken from their original sites and rebuilt in the museum gardens. The guide explained how people live in the different communities that exist in Vietnam (which has many ethnic groups living within its borders, although the majority are Viets). He showed us the kind of house in which he grew up as a boy and explained how the generations look after each other, and how the various indigenous crafts are practised - very interesting. At the end of the visit we saw the Giari tomb, which is surrounded by primitive wood carvings encircling the wooden tomb which are intended to depict the life cycle, but includes notable examples of priapic men and pregnant women; the figures are intended to accompany the dead into the afterlife."

Overall it only took us about 30 minutes to view the whole museum, and it was 20,000 to get it ($1USD)."

I like to be able to use public transport to get a better feel for a place. We spent a good part of the morning at the museum - and was able to picture the dress and some of the culture of the many different ethnic groups which make up Vietnam.

Also the most common group, Viet (86%) were well represented. It gave us a lot of insight as the days afterwards we visited minority villages in Sapa.Interestingly, there was a major exhibition, maybe temporary, about childhood, puberty and adolescence in relation to sexuality. The exhibition was very explicit and graphic and served children and young people to warn for sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancy, sexual harassment, sexual violence etc. There were some pieces of art that, looking closer were made of condoms. It was amazing and very positive to see how progressive and open Vietnam presents this. It should serve as a sample to many western countries.A great 3 hours spent here. Recommended !!"

Inside the main building are exhibits of clothing, tools, utensils, items associated with weddings, funerals, festivals and daily life in these communities. All have printed information in English, unlike many of the museums, and many include video presentations. Outside, behind this building is a collection of homes built, or transported and rebuilt here by craftsmen from the various ethnic groups. There is a great variety : the traditional Kinh (the majority group) home, a 40metre bamboo longhouse, a Bana communal house, and a mud house from the Mekong are a few examples.There is now a spectacular new building in the grounds housing the Museum of South East Asia with cultural artifacts from the various countries of the region. Only the ground floor is open at this time. It is also worth some time. The museum is a few kilometres west of the old quarter but worth the effort of getting there- there are buses, but the taxi fare is not high. Entrance fee is currently 40 000. I rate this as the best museum in the country. Set aside at least two hours. It is very easy to spend an hour exploring the houses outside."

It is a long way out of the city centre.The Vietnam Museum of Ethnology is extremely well done but we found it boring. It could be that we have travelled to various countries in the Far East and have seen the various ethnic groups and their homesteads for real, so seeing this set-up/scenario of Vietnamese ethnic group living, felt very staged. This is clearly my viewpoint, and I think for many other people, they would find it a fascinating worthwhile place to visit.There are exhibits outside set-up as various Vietnamese homesteads and villages, as well as a huge new building housing various exhibits inside.The highlight for us (a little juvenile perhaps) was a homestead with various wooden carvings, mainly of naked men & women.We used the toilets linked to the restaurant and they were disgusting.

We only had about an hour and a half at the museum but you could easily spend much more than this.All in all an excellent place to visit and should not be missed by those wanting to know more about the ethnic diversity of Vietnam."

Request for our tour to include this museum in our itinerary, and we don't regret it! probably the best museum we've visited so far. not many people when we visited, don't need to bear with the crowds to get close to attractions. got to know about cultures and lifestyle of different ethics, and with sample houses for each ethics too. was able to climb up the tall and long houses built by bamboos and woods to really feel what it was like to actually live inside. strangely we saw some teenagers studying and doing revisions alone inside some of the \"houses\", tucked away at the corner, probably this is the cosy place for them to revise."

Not sure whether this happens every weekend.. There were both indoor and outdoor exhibits, which were all very well-maintained. There were also signs in English so we could walk around the museum ourselves and take our time to look at all the exhibits. My favorite area was the outdoor exhibits where the actual houses of some ethnic groups have been moved from their original location to the museum.

It's a bit out of the Old Quarter but a $6, 15 minute taxi ride or a longer, but really cheap, bus ride, is well worth it. Admission is incredibly low, as with all museums in Viet Nam.The museum seems fairly new and modern, or at least well maintained. Exhibit signs are educational and objective and written bilingually (V'ese and English, maybe French?). They also have a museum guide available in several different languages. The exhibits indoor are top notch. Here you can learn about nearly all of Viet Nam's 54 ethnic groups. Some have less than 1000 members and live in such remote locations that this is the only place to get a glimpse of their lives. The real stars of the show are the traditional ethnic homes on the grounds behind the museum. The museum is a must visit if you don't have a chance to visit actual ethnic communities. And if you do, then this museum will have even greater significance. All the homes were built by members of the appropriate minority groups on-site. This place is a gem in Ha Noi and well worth at least a half day of your time."

Also, the washroom in the museum was the only unclean toilet we had found in any public facility in Vietnam. The outside however, was a real treat. You can enter all of the structures and they provide an excellent insight into traditional living spaces and construction. This museum is worth the visit, but I would suggest focussing on the outdoor areas and if you do want to visit indoors, do it very early in the morning before the tour buses arrive."

It exhibits the minority ethnics who live in Vietnam. It's very informative. It shows their culture and daily life. What I like the most is the ethnic groups house which is displayed outside. It will be much better if they also shows about the history of these ethnic groups and how they formed in Vietnam. Tips: hire a guide it will be more interesting since they will tell you interesting story about display"

It talks about minorities, but not their history and how they formed vietnam. Its no WOW on the pieces they show and the building itself is no big deal (lonely planet said it was remarcable). It's far away in town, and 130,000 vnd each way by taxi. They charge 50,000 if you want to take photos, but no one seemed to care or enforce this.Its not a bad experience, but its not a must see museum."

The authenticity of the tribal houses is impressive - all put in place by the tribes they belong to - and it was interesting to compare the different styles of building. Sadly the water puppet show that was supposed to be on wasn't on, but we spent the whole afternoon at the museum anyway. We got there by public bus, number 14, which runs from Hoan Kiem Lake or just north of the Old Quarter, followed by a short walk. The conductor helped us with the right stop and it took about 30-40 minutes from getting on the bus to arriving at the museum.

            "review": "Definitely worth visiting! So much to see (visual displays, information boards, and houses). There are so many different ethnic groups in Vietnam so the museum is really interesting to look around. The information here at the Musuem is fascinating and plentiful (in Vietnamese, English and French).Part of its attraction is also the grounds which have replica houses to explore representing many ethnicities and are fascinating to look through. I wear my plastic poncho and walk tightrope style on the thick concrete kerbs of the paths, occasionally needing to leap to the next concrete iceberg. If I misstep it will be into a miniature brown river complete with small swimming frogs passing by me.The different ethnic groups differ so much. Housing styles, clothing, customs, patriachal / matriachal villages. Many of the houses have great meaning to their design and the compass orientation of the house is important (as is the direction of the head while sleeping). I love that the houses here have been actually built on site by the respective tribe according to custom.I watch the water puppet show and look through the exhibit. There are 15 active troupes in Vietnam and they take turns performing here. The stories they perform are unique to each troup and the ways of the puppetry are closely guarded secrets. Traditionally invitation to join has been from father to son although that has relaxed a little now.I also visit a not for profit & disadvantaged youth restaurant on the grounds. I have a comfortable wicker seat on a semi covered porch, a breeze, and the sound of rain overhead. They have Nem cua be (fried spring rolls with crab) and when I ask the waitress which Viet dessert she recommends selects Che sua chua nep cam (sweetened black rice porridge with yoghurt). I loved the dessert and wasn't able to find it exactly again!"

This newish Museum in Hanoi tells the story of the 54 various ethnic groups who make up the population of the old Indochine area of SE Asia. There are some very nice artifacts displayed with labeling in both local languages and English and one can arrange for a guided tour. A number of displays of the various costumes and cultures are well set out. You do get a feel for the diversity of the various tribes and groups that have existed in SE Asia for so many centuries and how they interact. The large floor area is however fairly sparsely occupied and it would have been nice to see more in the collection, maybe this will occur over time. The entry fee is modest (some 40,000 VND). Access is a bit difficult as the Museum is some way out of town and best serviced by a taxi if you are not comfortable trying local buses. Fortunately there is a taxi stand outside the Museum so that you can return easily to your hotel. Allow 1-2 hours."

Not a large museum by any means, but it's supplemented by a fabulous outdoor section which has several life-size buildings built the traditional way.

All throughout the museum are informative signs in English.

For example an authentic funeral ceremony of the Black H'Mong minority is beautifully made with dolls and original material like the coffin and dresses, altar etc., also the video of a ceremony can be seen. On another floor there's a huge house showing the authentic design and rooms with dolls and furniture. Maps and information on different tribes and minorities accomplish the great experience. Only minus is that after a while it becomes hard to focus as there is so much to see and do but in Vietnam there are so many minorities and developments that it is hard to see through.

We went here with a free hanoi kids tour, therefore we had a free English guide (hanoi kids tours are free, and you can make a donation to their organization). We didn't read every placard or stop and watch every film because we had limited time. We maybe spent an hour indoors and then went outside to see the houses. Because we were in a downpour of rain we only ran between 6 of 13 houses because we weren't as prepared as we should have been!Additionally there is an outdoor water puppet stage here. I haven't seen anyone comment on the show so I can't speak for it but it would be interesting to be outdoors. Out guide said they have shows on the weekends.I would recommend wearing sandals or shoes that are fast to be taken on/off to see the outdoor houses as you are required to take your shoes off most places."

As a Vietnamese, I often thought museums in Vietnam were very boring because while growing up, I was taken to all war museums and looked at terrifying photos taken during the wars. However, this museum changed my mind. While living in Hanoi, I always proudly took all of my international friends to this museum to show them how rich our culture is. And I can tell that they were absolutely amazed. In Vietnam, we have 54 ethnic minorities and each has their own amazing culture. Instead of spending a lot of money and time to travel to mountainous areas to visit these minorities, you can spend a little more than 2 dollars for the ticket and 1 hour of your time to learn about all 54 of them. Inside the museum, for each ethnic minority, they have displays of their costumes, tools used in their daily life and custom. Here and there are TVs playing documents about some of the customs which, nowadays, are fading because of development. If you've ever watched Discovery channel where they show some customs in Africa that creep the hell out of you, you'll find the same feeling while watching those videos. Of course, creepy but extremely interesting! My favorite is the bike to which hundreds of bamboo nets are attached. You'll see a photo right next to the bike in which a man is actually riding the bike to sell the nets. Those are for fish catching. The models of tombs and typical houses on stilts on the garden outside are pretty impressive! Almost everything is available in English, French and Chinese. You can find flyers and instructions right at the entrance in those languages too!"

It gives a good insight of the culture of these people, their traditions, buildings and other. Take your time and read the plates, if you can book a guided tour, the better. The park is nicely made, the houses are in very good shape and some events are regularly organized. Negative: no A/C in the building. However, one of the highlights in Hanoi!"

There are some interesting items to see but very little information about them. We spent a couple of hours wandering round the different houses in the grounds, which was lovely, shady and very interesting. Would be amazing with kids as there were many hands on items and some of the houses had ladders to climb to get in. we strolled around for a while and also sat & read the guidebook for ideas on where to go next in the grounds.The cafe is pleasant and employs students from disadvantaged backgrounds working for catering/hospitality qualifications. The food was good, not particularly expensive & there was plenty of choice. If you want to avoid the taxis why not take the bus. The 14 drops off a ten minute walk from the museum & you can catch it from the north end of the lake. There are also buses that drop you off/pick you up right outside but those don't go from/to the old quarter. That said you could get the main train station & change or have a walk back from near the temple of literature. The buses are easy, comfortable, air-conditioned and cheap (5000VND per journey). You can buy maps from the post office by Hoan Kiem lake that include bus route details & from what we understood all the services in the city centre run every 10-15 minutes."

The museum does a fabulous job of explaining the diversity of tribal groups that occupy the country. It presented information in a variety of mediums. The videos were particularly interesting to watch. Even though we were unable to see different ethnic groups in person, a visit to the museum proved to be the next best thing. We came away feeling as if we had actually made trips to distant areas of the country where the tribes and clans live today.The outdoor area of the museum provides numerous examples of the structures occupied by different ethnic groups. Walking into these different structures provided a first hand example of what life among the different groups is like. This is an excellent museum, and a great primer for anyone planning to travel to oulying areas of the Country where the ethnic tribes live. Definitely worth seeing if you have the time."

All the information is well written in English and gives a very nice overview of the different ethnic minorities in Vietnam.

Leave at least 2 hours to get the most out of your visit- to look around inside, grab a drink (there is a nice cafe- good iced coffee) and then explore the buildings in the grounds.

The displays were a little samey and our attention did start to wander, The Water Puppet show was very good - in fact we thought it was better than the one we saw at the theatre."

Outside they have water puppet shows so try and be there when they are happening but even if you miss them the interactive outside area overall is amazing and so interesting to see the living environments of the ethnic groups that make up Vietnams population.

All the exhibit are well maintained, so the visit was enjoyable and we took many great pictures. The indoor exhibition was full with artifacts and tools, clothing, and the story about the culture. We can still take some pictures here. All the exhibit outdoor and indoor was very informative and revealing; if you're from Indonesia like me, you'll find some fascinating similarities and same root for some parts of the culture, like batik and clothing of some tribes. For my personal taste, the information is all provided very well in English, so a guide won't be a real necessity; but it will take some more time for you to read the whole information on an exhibit, so prepare a longer time."

Definitely worth a look if you are spending a few days in Hanoi.Make sure you leave time to explore the different types of housing that are on display behind the museum building - they are many and varied and according to the blurbs are actual abodes purchased from the original owners.(There is an extensive section dedicated to the cultural history of a sister city in France - it jars slightly with the rest of the exhibit and I struggled to comprehend the relevance unless it was part of a funding arrangement for the museum.)"

The indoor portion focuses on the daily pastimes and history of the various Vietnamese tribes. The outdoor portion mainly exhibits the tribal residences. The museum invited the tribal folks to come down specially to reconstruct the houses.There is also an outdoor water puppet show just by the Viet house. They have several shows per day, and last around half an hour each.We stayed much longer than we initially planned for the fascinating exhibitions. A great learning experience for the young and old.The museum is a little out of the way from the main tourist areas so take a cab (from a reputable company like Mai Linh or Hanoi Taxis) here."

The highlight of the museum are the traditional houses, though the main display area in the museum does a great job of providing insights into the many diverse people groups of Vietnam. Having lived in Cambodia for over 5 years, I appreciated the way that the museum did a great job of discussing cultural dynamics within SE Asia as a whole, and provided insights into the people groups that live within the region (i.e. both with Vietnam and Cambodia or Laos and Vietnam). Also, they had a water puppet show (only on weekends), which was a great way to see this show without having to go to a separate show (we were only in Hanoi a short time). Definitely recommended!"

We decided to visit the Museum of Ethnology, way out of the Old Quarter where we were staying, as it was an opportunity for our 4 year old to run around a bit in the tribal homes in the grounds. But what an unexpected treat the museum was! Not only were the houses totally authentic - each one built by tribal members who were invited to reconstruct the building at the site and featuring insights into tribal village life from around Northern Vietnam - but the indoor museum was superb.The circular building featured exhibits depicting life and skills from each tribe, several videos showing processes such as making and lacquering bamboo items, as well as costumes and textiles, cooking, festivals and children's toys. There is a small bookstand with some interesting titles, a museum shop selling beautifully crafted items at very good prices (cheaper and better quality than the tourist shops in the Old Quarter) and a good restaurant, which trains and employs young people recruited from deprived areas of the city. So sorry that my camera battery had given out earlier in the day! Well worth an afternoon of your stay."

Admittedly there is a lot of information, but it is displayed in such a text heavy, old-fashioned way. The France/ Vietnam photo exhibit was badly lit, sometimes it was quite difficult to read the signs. Also I really didn't get the point of the exhibit. Videos are not labelled, so you have to watch for a while just to figure out what is going on. I visited several museums in Hanoi and enjoyed this one the least. If you are a backpacker or on a limited budget I don't think its worth the time or expense to get here. The Woman's museum covered a lot of the same information regarding different ethnic groups, agricultural practices, ways of life etc (albiet from a female perspective) in a more interesting, interactive and informative way- I'd recommend you go there instead."

For me, the best part was the range of re-constructed village houses in the grounds around the main building.The museum is unfortunately a considerable distance from the centre of town, but there is a very comfortable cafe/restaurant that is not only a good place to relax for coffee or a meal but is an interesting project in itself. The restaurant was founded by retired teachers as a training programme for 'disadvantaged' young people, who receive a training here and are afterwards place in jobs in the hospitality industry. Food was excellent (try the shrimps-with-sweet-potato-pancakes!) and very reasonably priced, and the young staff were efficient and friendly.Tip: plan your visit to arrive around 11.00, to avoid the hordes of schoolchildren (some of them only 4 or 5 years old!) who are dragged around the museum in the name of education in the early morning hours. The children are individually charming, but as a group they are horribly noisy - but you can always take refuge in the cafe!"

Excellent features included a reconstructed long house, boat models (unfortunately without object labels), religious and ceremonial displays, and textile and ceramic exhibits. The grounds surrounding the museum features reconstructed traditional houses from several areas, a display of real boats and a water puppet theater more like what you'd see in the countryside. There are several performances each day. There is also a very nice cafe, a nice book shop and a gift shop. While the book shop had an excellent selection of books, the gift shop had a very limited selection of real traditional craft work.

Exhibits include costumes, utensils, even life-size constructions of typical houses and dwellings.

I would not go out of my way to make a visit to this museum happen if on a short travel to Hanoi but for those that stay a bit longer ad very good place to get a sense of the ethnic diversity.If in doubt hop onto the bus to Mai Chau for more immersion - be however aware that the Vietnamese government tends to organize and put up a pretty village facade for the tourists."

The museum is spilt in 2 parts , an indoor exhibition area with primarily costumes & exhibitions of local culture and an outdoor area with reconstructed buildings in the style of various ethnic groups. Both are worth visiting. The outdoor area has the bonus of water puppet shows (at 10,1130, 230 & 4 pm when i visited) These are in daylight and very authentic in the sense that the majority of the audience is Vietnamese who are clearly enjoying the show. It was very noticeable that the majority of tour guides hurry their groups past the water puppet show obviously on the promise they will be attending the Thang Long Water puppet theatre (see separate review). Its their loss. The museum show is a lot more comfortable, more relaxed , and has better photo opportunities although it is a little less polished. Whilst the museum is not the best iv seen of its type. its certainly not the worst and is well worth the effort to get to. The water puppet show(s) is/are a huge bonus."

Outside the museum there are recreated villages, you can go inside some of the buildings and imagine how the community lives. It is definitely a must see in Hanoi!"

Unlike many museums in the West that cover the field of Ethnology in a broad multiethnic range, this museum is devoted exclusively to the ethnic groups of Vietnam, but as there are no fewer than 54 of them, this allows for a very large exhibit, beautifully displayed on two floors of a lovely modern building. Essentially, one walks around in circles, and the signage could be improved to provide a more logical route than that offered by mere chance. While there is an inevitable overlap between the material representing each tribe, the range of variation is really quite surprising, and it is astonishing that they can maintain their individual identities right up to the present day. You will see the history of each tribe displayed through plaques and captions and an array of highly effective photos and illustrative paintings.These are supplemented by actual exhibits of their dwellings, implements, crafts, birth and burial customs, cooking and food habits, dress and costumes, crops, crafts, and mode of transportation. It is as exciting and educational an experience as I have ever had in any museum anywhere. This is no place to cut corners. Take your time, and remember to leave at least an hour for the other attractions: the large open-air reconstruction of full-scale dwellings, communal centers, schools, and places of worship of selected tribes; the excellent restaurant and cafeteria; and the gift shop that offers a staggering array of items way above the quality of the trinkets available elsewhere and at better prices. After all, there is not all that much in the way of culture in Hanoi that can compete with this jewel in the national crown."

Inside the museum you'll find a range of artifacts from different minority tribes, with descriptions of daily life and culture. While these are interesting, the gaps between the different groups are not as large as you might think, so it does become a bit same-y after a while.The real strength of this place are the ethnic habitations outside of the museum. Having a close-up look at how different groups build their houses gives great insight into the daily life of the people, and the differences here ae fore more striking. You need to take your shoes off in most places, but they also supply foot-coverings if you can't be bothered! For the money, it's well worth the visit.

There's also a restaurant /cafe that supports and trains young people and a garden with more exhibits."

It's all about the different tribes/ethnic groups in Vietnam and their traditional dress, houses, lifestyle etc. If that kind of thing does interest you, I am sure you will love it. It's got labels in English which are pretty informative, but it was just too information dense to stand and read it all. I preferred just chatting about life with the HanoiKids! It's a little away from where we were staying (Hoan Kiem Lake area) so we took a cab which took about 10-15 minutes, but this wasn't expensive at all - 102000dong/about $5. Also a huge modern looking new museum is being built on the grounds, which will house similar kinds of stuff but for ethnic groups in broader SE Asia. Not sure when the opening is planned."

Thus, without a guide, you can also explore on your own. But of course, with a guide, you can know much more about the culture of the different ethnic groups. There are a lot of information in the museum, be it indoor or outdoor exhibits. I love how they have outdoor real houses for tourists to take a look so as to better understand what we saw in the indoor exhibits. Really interesting!You can spend up to about 2hrs there or even more if you are extremely interested in the exhibits :)It is quite out of the way from Old quarter but really worth a visit if you want to gain an introduction and understanding of Vietnam's ethnic groups!"

Cynical I know but so many European museums are 'overcollected', that you lose the interest because you get drowned by the options. This museum is perfect, with more space dedicated to real life ethnic buildings than old paintings - you really get a feel for how people live in the ethnic minority villages of Vietnam. You've also got all the historical info you could ever need inside with artefacts and timelines etc I've been lucky enough to get out and into some of these villages and the museum has done a wonderful job. Hats off to the Vietnamese authorities and the French benefactors in putting it together.Oh and the museum shop has reasonable prices and money goes to charity - you'll probably get a better deal here than trying and failing at haggling in the old quarter for your nick nacks."

The bus cost us 5000vnd and took around 20 minutes in clear traffic. We had a note from our hotel written in Vietnamese to give to the bus conductor (or anyone else) which explained where we wanted to get off. When the bus drops you off, you need to cross over the large road and backtrack slightly to the first main turn off. A 5-10 minute walk past some large buildings and you will find it on your left. On the return trip just get the same bus on the opposite side of the road.The museum itself was pretty good; lots of things to read and artefacts to look at. There were lots of impressive traditional clothing outfits. Outside you can see, and walk into, lots of different styles of houses etc. We stayed for about an hour and a half in total.. I don't see how some reviewers say 4 or 5 hours can be spent here though? While the museum was good for information, we felt it lacked a little in excitement, or interaction - maybe something to note if you want to take young energetic children, they may get bored. We spent a long time stood around trying to read long information boards while hoards of noisy children bustled past us; it was a little hard to keep focus at times. Also with no air con it got a little hot in there.Overall I think it's worth going for half a day."

We thought we knew something about Vietnam but a visit to this museum showed us just how superficial our knowledge was of this vast, complex and populated country. So many young Vietnamese were ther, we thought it must have been a special day, but no, they just liked being there to celebrate their culture. An excellent display housed in the main building was complemented by what was going on in the grounds - a traditional water puppet show in an outdoor water theatre (thankfully it was outdoors because the fire breathing dragon puppets set fir to the stage curtain!), several life scale traditional houses were set up and you could go in and explore how some villagers lived and some examples of traditional burial buildings were set amongst the gardens. We were amazed at just how many discrete ethnic communities make up modern Vietnam and we enjoyed so much speaking to the young Vietnamese who approached us shyly just to practice their english and satisfy their curiosity.

The easily accessible and user friendly facilities ( including a free guide book by friendly staff) offer a clear and detailed account of peoples lives, their traditions, housing, food, tools, weapons, agricultural implements and items which make their lives unique to their environment, country and South East Asia. The outdoor exhibits include huge houses to clamber into and are simply fascinating. Even a free water puppet show on a Saturday afternoon!!

I found the highlight to be the different minority houses out back. It was really neat that they were built traditionally, and that you could walk around in them. Much less awkward than trying to walk up to some village and try and communicate an unguided tour. I actually saw some houses constructed in the same fashion during a recent road trip down the HCM trail around Hue, so I can vouch that they are indeed authentic. Inside, the information and display items were presented well and were very informative. There was a lot more than I had the attention span for, I could have done 2 days in here. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Side note - My French speaking girlfriend said that the French translations were better than the English one. Odd quirk, but a bit more enriching for the Francophone visitors."

First we saw the exhibitions inside of the museum building - they were very nice.Next we went for drinks and ice cream to the restaurant. We liked this little restaurant / school for disadvantaged youth so much that we decided to come back later for lunch. In the mean time we went to the outdoors exhibition where we could walk in to several houses and see how Vietnamese people used to live in various regions of the country. After that we went for lunch. Had a tuna sandwich, shrimp fritters and spring rolls with crab meat. Food was fantastic. By that time - it was a time for a siesta. We walked outside and among many not so honest taxis we found our taxigroup taxi (white w/red &blue letters) and for 140.000 dong we returned to the Old Quarter for siesta before dinner. What a great day."

I learned some important things. The challenge was that the reviews said that children loved this museum. My two kids were quite bored. However, all this changed when we saw the outside exhibits of the different traditional house structures of various ethnic groups. The museum is worth seeing simply for this.

Plus the information is much better laid-out than elsewhere.You can also buy some lovely textiles in the shop, although they're much more expensive than in the market in Hanoi or Sapa."

Some of the traditional costumes and dress and very vibrant and beautifully woven and you can see them up close and personal. The best thing about the museum, however, is outside. Surrounding the museum are something like 10-12 traditional ethnic houses, the large majority of which you can enter, walk around in and climb up to. Our children certainly loved the fact that they could touch and feel things like mats, drums, weaving, puppets etc. and they really enjoyed climbing up some of the ladders to get into 2-3 of the houses in particular. One issue: the museum is a little out of town to the west of the city; however, that said, it is a small inconvenience to go and visit something that provides and informative insight into the lives of ethnic Vietnamese. I would highly recommend this museum to anyone-especially those with children."

But, thankfully, the Museum of Ethnology was wonderful.It is really great to see Vietnam celebrating it's cultural diversity now, wheras years ago this would never happen. Pros:-Wheelchair Accessible; while I, nor anyone I know in Vietnam, is in a wheel chair, this is one of the only places in Hanoi that has ramps. I bring this up because while i was there, there was a group of Viet in wheelchairs doing a tour, and it made me think that there is just nowhere for them to visit easily.-Layout; there has been a lot of thought that has gone into this one, which is great to see, because the typical thought in Vietnam is quality over quantity. -Houses: I was really happy to see the houses from the tribes surrounding the museum. I also applaud the government for bring locals in to build their houses. For me, this was a highlight.Cons-Distance: It's definitely off the tour trail, being way out in Caiy Dau district, which will deter a lot of people. It also gives taxi drivers a chance to cheat you even more by taking you longer ways, or using a rigged meter. Be careful. Negotiate before you get in."

You also see their skills and crafts and the tools they used.It has maps showing you the migrations of the different peoples and it was a lot of information to digest.

Outside, there are examples of different structures used by these various ethnic groups, which can be toured independently. As I said, it's interesting and informative in a general way, but if your time is short, this may be one that you can skip."

This is a modern museum and of all the museums we saw in Vietnam this one probably came closest to what we would expect to see when visiting a museum in the U.K. The building is quite European in its architectural design. Internally the exhibits were good and informative with English translations. However, the best is undoubtedly outside the museum where they have erected many different types of huts from the various different regions of Vietnam. These also had different everyday objects used in these huts with explanations. Visitors can walk around freely inside them. Unfortunately, as this was part of a city tour we had to leave before we could explore as much as we would have liked to."

The displays of houses and buildings out side are not to be missed. When you leave beware of the cab drivers outside the gate, have someone phone for a cab for you. This will save you lots of money.I have been to this museum many times and each time I find something new that I missed the time before. It is a must if you are interested in the culture of Vietnam."

This gave such a valuable insight into the ethnic minorities living in and around Vietnam for travellers who, like us, were visiting vietnam for the first time and only going to the tourist centers. Make sure you allow enough time. After going into the museum you head around the side to see some replicas of housing used by these minorities and traditional Vietnamese people (I can't be 100% sure if all where replicas or if some were original but they are amazing regardless). Make sure your camera is charged because you will take a lot of photos! Very impressed. I'd recommend watching the videos that play inside the museum too."

It has a certain authentic and adventurous feel about it. There were a couple of houses I opted out of climbing because the ladders had very high rungs. I would recommend visiting it on your own rather than in a tour group because then you can truly explore. As it was, we only had an hour, and that is definitely not enough. I recommend about 3 hours. I took away a star because for a cultural treasure like that, the government needs to tighten its management and finish the new building that was under construction but was never finished due to corruption schemes."

The outdoor area is a very nice touch, where they've built replicas of a number of the different styles of homes in the region, many of which you can go inside and look around.It's a bit out of the way, and I wouldn't rearrange my trip around it, but if you're looking for something to do for a couple of hours while in Hanoi it's a pretty good option.

LOGISTICSThe museum is around 7km from the city centre and somewhat hard to find. Best way to get there I feel is to take a taxi. For memory it cost around 60,000 dong. Just be careful with Hanoi taxi's (lots of scams). According to lonely planet you can take a moto for 30,000 dong one way or take bus 14 (3000d) from Hoan Kiem Lake and get off at the junction between D Hoang Quoc Viet and D Nguyen Van Huyen. REVIEWAlthough this was a well set out and thought out building which had numerous objects, displays and explanations, at the end of the day it was a museum and museums are boring. As a 23yo male with a 22yo girlfriend I guess it was out fault for selecting this place but I was hoping to see more artwork. Instead it was just a collection of everyday objects taken from the million or so tribes of Vietnam. There was heaps of information but it was almost too much. Was like reading a book for each of the million or so tribes. We got bored after half an hour and left.CONCLUSIONAlthough the museum is very well set up and informative it is still at the end of the day........a museum. It can be a little boring for some so you have to ask yourself \"Do I want to go to a museum?\" before you come here. If museums are for you, you will enjoy it. If they aren't you will find yourself bored and looking for the door like we were.CONCLUSION"

Most of the display consists of original ethnic/tribal housing moved into a parklike setting. It was certainly interesting and makes a change from the noise and crowds of the city centre. We went with our guide, a \"HanoiKids\" guide and so we made the most of having a local guide and we caught a local bus (No. 14) from the Lake to near the Museum. The ticket cost 15 cents each and it was a fun experience."

More enjoyable are the exhibits on the grounds- houses from various parts of vietnam, some of them impossibly high. Adults and kids also have an opportunity to try stilt walking and other activities- kids enjoyed it. On some days there is also a water puppet show that lasts half an hour, but it is out in the open so the effects are a little less dramatic than those seen in a proper water puppet theatre. Worth spending 2-3 hours in this place.There is also a cafe at the back to rest your feet and recharge"

Another couple from Malaysia in our tour (we were the only 4 in the tour) also enjoyed, they found many similar tribal things and vibed with the displays there. There are very informational videos going on, I wanted to watch more but the tour guide was pushing us forward, I think would be best if you reach there yourself, keep half a day, watch the videos and walk slowly around, you'd understand more. Many artifacts have captions / explanations in English, so you don't have to wonder what each is. There's a wide variety of things from history of Vietnam, life and times of the different ( 40-50 ) ethnic / tribal people from all over, if you're starting your Vietnam tour from Hanoi, it would be best to start from here, you'd enjoy the country with more perspective, I wish we had done that instead of starting from Saigon. It's a colourful display of many things, would recommend about 2-3 hours and can stretch easily to half a day.

Though it does take a while to reach from the Old Quarter (taxi is about 5-6 USD) the museum is worth the drive. The open-air exhibits feature a number of different huts, each from a different tribe. Upon removal of shoes (only for certain dwellings), you can poke around each of the musty rooms while reading about traditional housing arrangements and constuction. Beside the houses, there is an informal water puppet show that runs for most of the day which is complimentary. The indoor exhibits are worth a quick look - most have traditional clothes and textiles on display. The museum closes at 5:30, so you'll want to at least arrive by 3 (includes time for a bite to eat, puppet show, and thorough exploration of exhibits). While you're at the museum, check out Baguette & Chocolat - a cafe located on the grounds with tasty lunch items and drinks. The hot chocolate is good, and the chocolate mousse is a must!

They had videos playing at about every exhibit to show how the people would use the objects on display. The garden out back has walk through exhibits that are peaceful and worth the stroll. If your hungry the cafe out front has got a great shrimp and sweet potato lunch for $2;)"

A very interesting museum if you're interested in learning about the tribes and groups in Vietnam. Lotd of handicrafts, clothes and information about traditions on show. Outside are about 10 huts and structures built by people from the minority groups demonstrating the structures their people live in and build. Some very impressive buildings! Have a look!"

It displays artifacts, clothing, and memorabilia from the many ethnic groups in Vietnam. Plus, there are several examplesof the building styles used by the various tribes throughout the country. It is an excellent prep course for the trip to Sapa (or any other area where the various unassimilated ethnic groups live), as it explains how long they have lived in Vietnam, and some of their local customs, like funerals. The weaving information is particularly helpful. There is a Craft Link museum shop as well. Take a taxi - it's a long way from the Old Quarter, but much more interesting than the Ho Chi Minh museum, mausoleum, etc."

We opted to take the local bus with the help of our hotel who wrote down in Viet to ask ppl how to get to the museum. If you are adventurous & have time, you can take the bus no14 at Hoan Kiem Lake by the Tourist Info Center. Once you get on bus there will be an attendee going around collecting the bus fee. We showed him the note from our hotel written in Viet. He let us know when to get off. On the way back the bus's last stop is at the Lake. There is a walk to the museum and sadly we had to cross a really wide street so we asked a taxi to drive us the 300m. Our hotel warned us about taxis scamming when you leave the museum so best to take a reputable taxi like Hanoi Taxi or Mai Linh.It's closed on Mon. Open 8:30am-5:30pm. We didn't get a tour guide but there were English signs explaining the exhibit. Very extensive display about each of the 53 ethnic groups. There is an outdoor display of the homes they lived in which you can actually enter and look around. We spent about a total of 3hrs at the museum including indoor and outdoor displays and lunch at the restaurant (Baguette & Chocolat)on site. Also, there is a gift shop that is associated w/Craft Link which works w/local artisans. Recommend checking out the restaurant and gift shop."

Although the videos are poor quality and dated, the stories capture unique cultures (religious traditions, burials, etc). Informative and timely exhibit on HIV/AIDs -- English translations. Great way to spend the afternoon."

It is informative and a nice mirror of life in rural Vietnam even in recent years. Explanations in English and French. The outdoor exhibit provides illustrative examples of relatively recent dwellings from various parts of Vietnam. Admission fee: 25'000 d. Closed on Mo. On site restaurant with simple but good food. Guides available (fee). A bit far from the Old Quarter (15-20 min. per taxi). Nice way to spend a morning or an afternoon in Hanoi.Tip: beware of taxis parked in front of the museum. My taxi back to the hotel had a tinkered meter charging about three times the normal rate."

We had an late afternoon flight and only spent 3 hours. Admission was 25.000VND and we paid another 50,000VND for an English speaking guide. The guide led us on a tour of the inside of the museum and provided a very good overview of the cultural heritage of the 54 ethnic minority groups of Vietnam. We then went outside and explored the different styles of housing of each of the groups we learnt about. If we had have had more time, we would have gone back into the museum to learn more. This museum is a credit to the Vietnamese government as it encapsulates the heritage the country may lose as it becomes more westernised."

I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time but did not have time then to walk around the typical traditional houses on display in the grounds of the museum. This time I did the lot. The ethnic minorities are gradually being overwhelmed by modernity and the rapid pace of change affects them as it does the Kinh majority. This may be the only place to see how some ethnic minorities dressed, were housed and lived their daily lives. It's one of the most interesting and colourful museums of its kind that I have ever visited.Since my previous visit Craft Link has opened a shop near the front entrance and Hoa Sua has established a restaurant in the grounds so it's possible to support good causes during your visit. There is also a bookshop outside the front door with a wide range of books, postcards, pictures and charts. For 150,000 VND I bought a book of beautiful coloured photos of all the ethnic minority groups in Viet Nam."

We were traveling with a two year old who had his fill after only touring the expansive grounds and reproduction houses, so we didn't even get to see inside the museum, but we had such a fun time outside, the rest of the museum will be on our must-see list when we return to Hanoi. The historical houses are incredibly varied and interesting, though climbing up and down those teeny ladders is not for the faint of heart or poor of balance! We were lucky to catch a water puppet performance on a Sunday afternoon. Would rate this an absolute must-see for families with young children. Highly recommended. Easy cab ride from the city, and easy to catch a cab outside again when you're done. Pleasant stroll outside really makes this museum special."

This museum is set up to help the local people and tourists alike understand and appreciate the over 50 different minority tribes in Vietnam - each with their own culture, language, and style. It is very interesting, and provides lots of information in English so you can really learn about these interesting people, most of whom live in Northern Vietnam. You can see how they live now and in the past, what their cultures are like, and out back of the museum, you can even see houses of several of the tribes to see how they live. These houses are built by the minority people themselves, and are now popular with locals to take their wedding photos.This museum is best visited on your own, as there is plenty of signage to open your eyes to their cultures here, and is definitely worth a visit, especially if you'll be going to Northern Vietnam where these people are so prevalent - you'll have a clue what you're reading on your tourist brochure for the area now. The museum is well done and informative, and definitely worth a couple hours of your time. It's pretty cool to walk through their homes and see the different styles of the architecture from tribe to tribe."

It just opened on December 11, 2007, and was really well done. A great compilation of artifacts he collected, photos, and excerpts from his fieldwork journal. The permanent exhibit was laid out in an interesting way too. The complex is modern but its location is far from the other touristy destinations. Getting there by taxi is well worth it. This is definitely one of the nicer museums in Hanoi."

It has informative exhibits, information in several languages, and can be viewed in approximately two hours. The museum focuses on the 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam and explains each of them separately. Be sure to stop for the videos--most of them display the death rites of many of the tribes and as you go through the museum, you get a better understanding of the nuances of the various groups. The museum is not located close to any of the major hotels, but the taxi ride is typically under $4 US."

I had visited the museum once before, but with my husband in tow, instead of my daughter, we spent a leisurely three hours absorbing the information in the fascinating exhibitions. Loved the displays of garments, material objects, tools, and explanations of how they were used, and their history. All the ethnic houses were fascinating, and we were fortunate that our guide contacted a volunteer who explained about the houses. This enhanced our visit. Especially fascinating for me, as a visual anthropologist, was the Hmong exhibition. The exhibition, placed in the Hmong house, was a fine example of having people who are often photographed by others, taking the opportunity to use cameras themselves and photograph their own lives. Their comments indicated their view of, and acceptance of, tourists, a fine sense of humour, and insights into lives that we would not otherwise see."
