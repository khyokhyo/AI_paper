Stunning floor and wall tiles and stucco, with loads of rooms to wander and get lost in, courtyards with banana trees. No English guide material on display, all in French which was a shame, but could possible have taken a guided tour. Refreshing lack of shopping opportunities (which are overwhelming elsewhere!), and a beautiful tranquil little haven from the bustle - highly recommended."

Well the Badi Palace was closed for 3 months (as of September 2016) for work. So I walked over to the Bahia palace and was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful architecture, courtyard, sumptuous rooms, the tile work, extravagance. Infinitely interesting, and all for $1 US dollar. I don't know how they maintain the place by charging so little. It's may be a 5-minute walk from the Badi palace. Hugely recommend everyone make a stop at the Bahia Palace."

From the outside it does not look much (though our guide told us that Moroccan homes are usually very understated on the outside as a sign of respect to neighbours who may not be as well off) but inside it is really beautiful and worth a visit. I would recommend taking a guide who can explain the history of the different rooms. Overall, a very informative and interesting visit."

It was built in the late 19th century, intended to be the greatest palace of its time. The name means \"brilliance\". As in other buildings of the period in other countries, it was intended to capture the essence of the Islamic and Moroccan style. There is a 2 acre (8,000 m\u00b2) garden with rooms opening onto courtyards."

Set behind high walls, it is a haven of peace and quiet as one leaves behind the heat and the dust of the Medina. The gardens are lush and cool on entering at the gate in the wall. A short walk to the palace emerges at a modest entrance, and within its shaded walls and dark corridors there's a wealth of beautiful architecture.One can walk, undisturbed, from room to room. Most are unfurnished. This is not plush. But the ever present tiled floors and walls, doors, intricate windows, mirrors and exotic open courtyards were plentiful reward for the long walk and the tiny entrance fee."

Beautiful mosaic work all around the palace. Relatively easy to see everything (we did a tour in 30minutes). Nice place to find a corner and read a book or listen to music / meditate. Visiting once is enough but worth a see as it is a good getaway from the medina madness of you want some soothing quiet time."

Outside you can sit and have drinks(non alcoholic) with the locals and visit the Jewish quarters where you can buy argon oils and great spices. Local people were all very friendly, they will try and get you to go the Jewish markets etc but if you don't want to just politely say so. Costs 10 Dirhams each which is approx 80p. You can easily find your way back to the medina on foot which is about 20 min walk."

He explained so much about the architecture and history of Bahia Palace. We never would have appreciated the history of this palace without his input. There is not much there posted by way of signs or literature, so I would highly recommend hiring a guide or doing your homework before you visit.The craftsmanship and work by the artisans is stunning to behold and the place is quite vast in size. I even had a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" moment there and my guide joked that perhaps I had been there in a previous life as a princess. I assured him, if I was here in a previous life, it was only as help!The palace is still in use, but most of it is open to the public. If you are in Marrakech, Bahia Palace is not to be missed."

The style of the Windows and the colourful ceilings are just lovely - don't forget your camera! Wandering in and out of the rooms leisurely, taking photos and just enjoying the calm and quiet is a lovely way to while away and hour or two. There are quite a few areas that could do with having some money spent on them but I think if they put the entrance fee up a little they would be able to achieve this.

The palace inside is beautifully decorated and very large, there is a very well maintained garden as well. The palace was very quiet when we visited (3pm on a Sunday) and the only criticism is that there was nowhere to buy water or to sit down and have a drink. Bahia palace could really do with a small shop or a cafe - but other than that it is really worth a visit if you're in Marrakech!"

No palace in Morocco is as grand as the ones in Europe but this one has a typical relaxed Moroccan style to it. Sadly, a large part is closed to public. The carvings on the walls and the roof are exquisite. Not very big. An hour is enough for a normal visitor but it's a must visit for those visiting Marrakech."

Walking around the Bahia Palace is really a pleasant step back into history -- both of the grand viziers who lived there and the French who took over later. You can actually trace the renovations done by the French as you look at the new style of painting on the wooden doors (flowers instead of the Moroccan/Moorish geometric flourishes), the size of the windows (large for the French) and the \"French\" doors. It is fascinating to see the rather sterile rooms and then try to imagine the glories of the decor during the period. The architecture and decoration are worth a close look as is the garden which is a calm oasis. Not large but a treat to walk around in the chaos of the city outside. Admission is only 20 dirhams and it is well worth that and more. They were preparing an art exhibit the day we were there but unfortunately we were not staying long enough to take advantage of that."

The Bahia palace started off at a disadvantage as we had just come from Granada, heads still reeling from the splendor of the incomparable Alhambra. I was expecting to be underwhelmed but lowered expectations were a gift because the Bahia was a gorgeous discovery on a hot languid afternoon. Whilst the Mudejar ceramic tiles walls are common with all the other great Moorish palaces the Bahia boasts beautifully intricate hand painted Windows and ceilings which are absolute stunning. I spent so long looking upwards my neck got stiff. The Marrakech Biennale was on and there were various contemporary exhibits and installations on which were a pleasurably discordant yet harmonic note with the traditional architecture. The courtyard is stunning and the gardens are brilliant to wander around in the afternoon sun. Time seems to stand still here and you completely forget the hustle and bustle of the Medina which is right outside. Absolutely must see."

The palace is large and we read all we could in advance so knew where the rooms were for government officials - off one of the smaller patios - and where the closed-off quarters of concubines were. We were advised to see the Dar Si Said Museum first, so we could compare the unrestored (Dar Si Said) with the restored (Bahia). It was good advice, though neither had the exhibits we hoped for. The Bahia was in better repair, but both need attention. We were later advised that a smaller, private museum between the two had better artifacts. From what we've seen so far, the most informative exhibit was the Berber Museum at the Jardin Majorelle - more complete and well-annotated. Yet, the scale of the Bahia Palace did speak of the regal lifestyle of earlier pashas, if only in architectural terms."

There is also the Grand & Petit Courts, Courtyards and the Court of Honour where slaves begged for their lives. Past the Harem is a beautiful blossoming garden with fountains.Today, most of the remaining rooms are being occupied by the Moroccan Royal family and others are being renovated. There is a 10dh fee but no information inside that I could find. I also did not see much furniture or period pieces inside. It will take you about an hour to visit the rooms and garden.

Tourists are allowed to visit a small part of it, some rooms with exquisite decorations in Arabic and Berber style, and some serve as rooms for exhibitions of modern art. There are two well maintained small courtyard gardens with various plants and fountains. It is also possible to see the newly renovated Harem area and the school part of the Palace. The Palace has a modest gate which is the entrance close to the Mellah/Jewish Quarter. A visit takes about half an hour because of the limited amount of rooms you are allowed to visit, but it is well spent time and worth a visit when in Marrakech. Entrance fee."

Government run, but the buildings, gardens and architecture were lovely and with a special art expo on it added value, even if the art was a bit modern for the old building.You can pay for a guide, not sure how much, but listening to others they seemed very good.It is a place to meander out of the sun and chaos of the medina, and a lot bigger than expected.We enjoyed it on a lonely planet trek around Marrakech"

Bahia Palace has some stunning mosaics and ornate carved painted ceilings, and that's just the first room. Wait, that's every room, and they're all pretty much the same. Or am I missing something? Maybe I didn't see everything? The LP guide speaks of a room for the prince's favourite concubine and that it has fabulous stained glass - we couldn't find it. Maybe it was closed. Part of what makes a great museum is the information available - I don't think I saw any signs other than those for the contemporary art that is being displayed here. Bahia feels like a shell, and it would be so nice if even just one room had been furnished to suggest how it might have looked in its 19th century heyday.

Inside a series of courtyards and rooms make the Palais Bahia a delight to explore: the highlights were the scent of orange blossom permeating the the beautiful gardens and wonderful and varied Islamic architecture decorating the many wings. During our visit the palace was also hosting an art exhibition and different artists had their works displayed in various rooms, accompanied by pamphlets explaining the work and the introducing the artist. This was a fascinating and fabulous bonus, with some of the contrasts between the work and their astonishingly artistic surroundings being particularly striking. The only thing that would've made the visit better was if we had had a guide to take us through and reveal to us some of the Palais Bahia's history, as I've no doubt it's just as interesting as the palace is beautiful."

The Courtyard was a large marbled area and the marble is from Italy as with the columns. I can imagine in their times the gardens were beautiful. The rooms in the Palace had no external windows, so the rooms would've offered limited natural lighting. I can't imagine being cooped up in the Palace with all the other wives. Large tour groups throughout it's a good thing I had my personal guide otherwise I wouldn't know a thing. Everything is worth a visit but offered me nothing great.

The ceilings feature carved and intricately painted wood and the walls and floors are, as you would expect, covered in mosaics in the traditional colours. The male and harem quarters are segregated, with an expanse of brilliant white floor in the harem. From here you can watch the nesting storks on the nearby tower, which had a attracted a couple of bird watchers. Can get pretty busy but no restrictions on photographs, which isn't always the case in Marrakech."

Truly beautiful with rich colours everywhere, room after room until you get to the main courtyard and that is even more stunning. Lots of mosaics to look at and beautiful doors everywhere. Everything suggests that this palace was indeed something that was marvelled at back in the days - and even in this day and age, once can see how grand this place would've been. The designs of the building also reminds you of the Ben Youssef medersa - especially some of the calligraphy.There is a small garden area to one side which is also a pleasant and quiet place to be. It is very easy to spend a good couple of hours here. As someone else mentioned, I hope the authorities continue to ensure that this building is looked after - indeed a lot of places in Marrakech, including the Ben Youssef medersa, need more maintenance in order to ensure the generations after us can continue to marvel at some of the older buildings from history."

Inexpensive to enter and so beautifully constructed its a real 'must- a complete contrast to the El Badi Palace which is also worth a visit but completely different in scale and design. The ceilings at the Bahia Palace are a wonder to behold with fantastic woodcarving, paintwork and plasterwork as well as tiling. Definitely worth it for an hour or so."

It is one of the must-see points of attraction in Marrakech, with its welcoming and refreshing gardens and the beautiful mosaics. The entrance fee is cheap but even if it were more expensive, i would have considered it money well spent. There's intricate beauty everywhere: painted ceilings, mosaics, carved stucco... Even a few baby kittens laying in the garden :) All in all, a relaxing, peaceful visit to a not-to-be-missed site. Watch out for the vendors, they'll wait for you outside the gates and aggressively try to sell you stuff. I saw some beautiful bracelets there though, but make sure you show interest only if you really-really want to buy something. If not, refuse them firmly and walk away, otherwise they'll chase you and you can't imagine you persistent they are."

It's well signposted until the last 100m when you have to go down a side road, or you could take a horse carriage from the square. The structure is well maintained but looks very empty with no furniture. Without a guide you have to guess at a rooms use. The gardens are a cooling down place and many of the rooms have modern art exhibits in them. There is no place for refreshments in the building so make sure you have some with you"

The courtyards are delightful in mainly white and blue while the rooms luxuriate in myriad colours and gold leaf. There seems to be a never ending chain of these rooms leading one into another.

Nonetheless worth a visit that takes you about an hour to an hour and a half. Every room/courtyard has their own special works of art, mosaics, patterns and styles. Really interesting to see! Even though many of the rooms require serious renovation (e.g. faded colors, missing tiles, damaged mosaics) it is still worth a visit and in a way adds to the experience of a past and forgone time.

Came the next day with a English guide for the actual storytelling. Did pick up few interesting bits from him along with him telling us the best part of the palace is the back courtyard which was closed to public for renovation. From what i got to see, the Bahia Palace was among the least interesting sites of my 11 days tour. Lot of it may be blamed on the closure of sections, a lot on seeing much better sites in Morocco and a lot on our guide, he provided interesting information on the style of construction but little on the historical facts. The entry to the site is 10 dirham"

We went to Bahia Palace on January 11th as it was our last day in Marrakech and we had a few spare hours until our flight back home.The entry was 1 euro or 10 dirhams.The palace was literally a building with empty rooms,that's it.It lacks something 'going on in there', perhaps a museum or activities,etc. I've noticed a few small signs with explanations what used to be done by the kings in which room, but it clearly lacked some 'visuals' like furniture or something.Very disappointing.No cafes or gift shops inside."

We visited anyway.It was very crowded which made enjoying the serenity of the place and seeing the tiling a little difficult. There is no information available and as the rooms are empty you can't even guess the details of the Palace's history. It was a shame not to have a greater appreciation of its history nor the scale of it (not all is open tothe public). As usual, getting change at the ticket booth was a challenge.We didn't enjoy it as much as the Badi Palace but we do enjoy older history (Badi Palace - c 15th Century vs Bahia Palace - late 1800's)."

It doesn't have much information on display (short outline in the first courtyard as you go in) but it seemed to have been built fairly recently mid 1800's It has some superlative islamic decoration nevertheless and its relative youth allows you to appreciate some of the colours and contrasts they used. It was good to get a sense of colour in the doors and ceilings. Well worth the entrance fee. In a side room you will find a man who does a name/words in arabic script for 25dhm. Ok you can get these in loads of places but I appreciated the fact that he seemed so serene while he did the work and deft at some colourful sweeps to embelish the card. A little bit of art. Good place to get one done as a lot of what you see in the souks is neither what it appears to be or the price you think it is."

The pictures only tell part of the story that a guide fills in by describing the various designs and lettering and their purpose.One example. The courtyards are square, with the center open to the sky. The center floor is sunken a few inches so that rain water can drain and will not get into the living areas.Note in the pictures a ceiling that looks multicolored when viewed straight up, but is red when viewed at an angle. This is done by the sides of the beams being painted solid red, while the ceiling and bottoms of the beams are painted in intricate patterns."

The palace is not extremely old, mid 19th century (so it has a limited history) , but unless you have a guide with you (which we didn't) don't count too much on indication panels as we saw only one or two of them. That, for example, could be something easy enough to fix. Also, I became a real fan during my visit of morroco of carved wood and mosaics, which the palace shows plenty of BUT it is absolutely not looked after or maintained at all. There was a pigeon nest over a beautiful carved door, I admit the baby pigeons were cute but I'm not sure the known corrosive effect of those birds dejections is just as cute. An other point, less serious, but it still shows that the monument is not taken care of is the completely worn painting on the walls. It wouldn't take much to give the palace a fresh turn which would render the visit much more striking for the eyes. However from the actual state it is in, we can only imagine what it must have looked like in its early days with the mix of vivid blue and white colours. It is certainly a beautiful palace, which clearly gives an example of typical morrocan architecture but is wasn't, at least for us, a \"wow\" experience. I would advice it as something to do if you have spare time but do not make it a priority in your \"to-do list\" for morroco."

One can see the old harem where several of the women of the house lived in luxury but also in closed quarters because they were not allowed to come out of the castle. Beautiful place to visit and with a local guide it is even more interesting. It is advised to take a guide from the tourism office or by the hotel reception.

So take water and put nice sandals, the floor is hot! You get a fantastic idea how a muslim palace was laid out in the 16th century. The mosaics, the bows, the way of construction is very nice. I walk with an invalid stroller and it was good to do. People are very helpful to help you some steps up and down. I think it is less for children, they may not understand the meaning of the visit. At the end you can visit a small photomuseum which is interesting. Any question will be answered with pleasure!I found it a must to visit this place in the medina. You can also see the roofs of the roal palace, and the flag hanging out, since he was there. It is a big an quite place within the city walls!"

As with a number of other buildings which are accessible to the public in Morocco, the Bahia Palace is a good example of classic Moroccan architecture, comprising the white plastered walls, combined with mosaic tiling to the floors and walls and the intricately decorated columns and ceilings.Whilst this building presents a number of good photo opportunities, particularly around the courtyard areas, there is nothing which really stands out as exceptional.The only examples of items which would have been contained or used in this beautiful building are locked away is glass display cabinets and these are somewhat limited.In summary, worth a visit if you are in Marrakech, but not for too long."

The walk to the Palace from a chaotic rubble strewn square was between luxuriant foliage and took you from chaos to calm in a few minutes, also from heat(45C) to cool. The interior style of the Moroccan buildings is simply beautiful, the shapes of doors and windows, the simplicity of symmetrical structures and then the intricacy of stucco, mosaic and inlaid woods and this is a perfect example. Take a neck brace with you as you will spend most of your time gazing upwards. The only downside for me is that there is no interior furnishing to show how the Palace was used or how the inhabitants lived; for me that would have added to an overall appreciation.(obviously too much NT)."

Bahia Palace is such a stunning attraction with so much history behind it! My friend and I went as part of a discovery of Marrakech tour (which I recommend as you visit all of the main attractions in Marrakech and get to know all of the history behind them) Our tour guide was brilliant at reeling off all facts about the palace and telling us about the architecture/history. The only downside to this place is that it there are too many people around, but who can blame them for wanting to visit such a stunning attraction!If you're going to Marrakech, this place is a MUST!Oh, and don't forget to look up when you walk into each room! The ceilings are out of this world!"

After the lunacy of the Marrakech streets, entering the Bahia Palace was a welcome relief from traffic dodging. The entrance fee was a pittance and my 7 year old got in for free. It's a nice walk up through orange trees with kittens and cats lying around to the Palace itself. We didn't take a guided tour (but I can't remember any tour being suggested) and my French is very limited and my Arabic non existent - I couldn't therefore read the information boards dotted on walls throughout the palace. Having just read the review below, we were completely unaware of there being any underground passages here. As the place isn't furnished, you get less of a feel of how it would have looked. Having said all this, it was all quite beautiful and peaceful and we weren't in a rush to head out back to the streets. Some brochures in different languages to explain what you're seeing would be a good add on for this attraction - I would have been happy to pay for one."

The picture he painted with words filled the empty rooms with the lush decadence and harsh cruelty of past times. He pointed out small details such as the Star of David in the Jewish waiting room that made the experience more poignant as it was a reminder that Islam is a religion based on tolerance. The courtyards were lush, green and serene and the architecture and the mosaic tiling were jaw droppingly stunning."

It's too bad, that the big garden that I was lucky to see at my first visits as well as the big last court of the concubines are no longer open to visitors. Some parts of the building are constantly under construction. My suggestion is, that the city of Marrakech which has been voted as tourists no. 1 destination recently should take care more of this place and invest more money as well as take higher entrance fees (now \u20ac1) in order to reconstruct the Palais propperly and more quickly. Its a shame, that buildings of the same period in al Andalusia/Spain are kept as a more appreciated and preserved heritage, than in Morocco itself. Although it should be much more easier here, where craftsmans and authentic techniques are right beside! It could be such a beautiful place with the right management!"

It's a very peaceful place, despite being in the Medina. Shame you can't see more of it."

Palace is typical of mosaic floors, decorated doors, fountain in between a huge hall etc. When we went some of the places were locked - so we visited almost 60% of what the palace is shown in the map. Entry fee is 10MAD. This is very near to Jemma El Fnaa and is walkable. Spice shops and others occupy the neighborhood. No information boards to give some history or importance of the rooms - this is something management can look at."

There is a circuit of the palace marked, but nothing to stop you from doubling back or doing the circuit again. In the palace are some stunning rooms and some internal patios well worth a few megabytes of your memory card.The palace can get busy with guided groups, but if it does, just wait until they have moved on, and you should have plenty of time to admire everything on offer."

I might have enjoyed it more, if we had a guide, so that maybe my understanding would have been better.I do think it would have looked incredible with furniture etc,and the energies, I think would be different, but it was empty rooms.

He also had 28 concubines! And that the beautifully decorated ceilings were reflected in rugs of the same design on the floor. With wall hangings and silk curtains it must have been sumptuous. It is a pity more of the palace is not open to the public as I expect it would be a treat to see the scale and beauty of the whole palace and perhaps the areas that the servants had to work and live in such as the kitchens, stables, etc."

So just enjoy the carvings, the architecture, the tiling and have a relaxing wander around the place. My children (10 and 14) have always enjoyed exploring unusual places and we spent a very happy 30+ minutes here. They made up their own minds as to what they were looking at! (NB: They didn't get charged for entry so even more of a bargain!)Many reviews of Marrakech talk about the sellers trying to get money out of you at every turn, but my daughter summed it up for me when she realised what it was about the 'tourist attractions' in Marrakech that felt different - they don't do 'gift shops'. You are not made, as in England, to exit the place via the shop and made to part with money there. But perhaps they are missing a trick!"

As I booked the 1/2 day guide through my Riad, they sort of got the guy after it was arranged about a week or 2 ago. The palace was nice, more of the ceramics and large spaces. Not too much t osee. AS tourists we were late getting back to the Riad at 3:00pm instead of 2:00pm to meet the guide so somewhere around 6:00pm he had to 'go'. As this was my first and only personal tour guide in Morocco, I don't think we got value or attention for money. 1.) The personal guide wasn't that accommodating. 2.) He didn't help us to get the best rate for the taxi ride from Sidi Ben Slimane parking lot. He just let the beige taxi stiff us for the ride based on the taxi's opinion about the traffic he imagines he will meet. 3.) The guide had to take a different taxi and meet us at the front of the Bahia Palace. 4.) Warning: Do not go to the oil, perfume and the seed shop just to the right side of the palace. The guide took us there and it was a rip off. The girls are young and they don't weigh anything. They overcharged for the items I bought: black soap for hammam, 2 small tubes of orange blossom oil, 1 small tube of patchouli oil and finally 1 oz. of chia seeds for 20MOD - final total for everything ended up being about 180MOD. The Bahia palace was okay but as the guide mentioned to us in the middle of the square at Jemma el fna market square in Marrakech at 6:00pm. He actually said, do you want me to take you back to your Riad or do you stay here and shop a little more. All in all, we could have done without the personal tour guide. Thanks to my wonderful Riad they picked up the tab for the poor service."

We loved our time at the Bahia Palace. The admission was only 10 dirhams per adult, and all of our children were free. The rooms and garden were beautiful and it was a lovely way to spend a couple of hours wondering around the grounds, admiring the architecture and surroundings. It is located in the south of Marrakesh, approximately twenty minutes from Jemaa el Fna."

My children loved walking through the palace - we walked through some areas more than once. Because the tour of the palace isn't as structured as other places outside Morocco, the kids were able to spend more time and get closer to the things they found most interesting. Also - cats.

Our guide gave us quite a detailed explanation of the history of the palace, when it was built, how long it took to build it, when it went into disrepair, how it is being refurbished, and what it's present use is. Then he let us wander around on our own and take pictures. Also, keep in mind that not all of the palace is open to the public. The inner court had the retractable ceiling closed the day we were there. That made it much more dramatic upon entering as there was a HUGE brass lamp fixture hanging from the middle of the retractable roof. You can go down various hallways, seeing where the kitchen and other facilities were located. One little corridor led us to a spectacular find. This was the corridor that took us to the three room hamam. In the very back room was a man doing calligraphy in Arabic. For a very minimal fee...I think it was $14 durham but can't remember anymore, he would do your name in Arabic and in calligraphy style. There were also some paintings for sale along the walls of the haman, one of which I purchased. It reminded me of buying a Berber carpet while I was in Fez. The paintings themselves are unique as the frames are also painted and decorated to match the actual piece of art."

The amount of exquisite detail still vibrant and visible in this centuries old palace in truly astonishing.Our small group of 10 had a guide for the day and he was well worth the money, given his knowledge and skill at sharing the history of the palace along with side stories about the harem section and the wives - fascinating!Plan at least a couple of hours to really tour the rooms slowly, and savor the skill of such beautiful artists - from ceiling to walls, down to incredible details on the floors, as well as doors and arches, so much of the spaces are utilized to showcase incredible geometric art from artisans hundreds of years ago with amazing textures and compositions filled with visual beauty. Truly inspiring.If you are an art, architecture or history lover, this is definitely a must see location, gorgeous!"

As a person that likes to understand history and culture of a place this was somewhere I wanted to go more than my wife.On arrival we realized we needed 10dh each to enter ( less than \u00a31/$1.50). There is a walk way up to the palace which is littered with what I think are stray cats. Fine if you like cats but I thought I had entered a cattery instead of a palace at first.When we finally arrived at the palace all the writing explaining history on the wall was either Arabic or French so I couldn't learn anything about the history or culture so had to make do with being fascinated with the architecture which is definitely something I admired.The whole site has very nice vistas and new thresholds and the use of courtyards and light throughout the site is also admirable architecturally speaking. The fountains in the courtyards are not turned on which was a shame as that would have been quite soothing and added to the experience. Really, other than the fact it used to be a working a palace it wasn't interesting enough for English-only speaking tourists to gather more understanding of the culture and history which was quite disappointing.The whole site was visited in less than 25 minutes but for \u00a31.00 you can't really complain too much. A pretty palace but ideally you need an english speaking guide to explain things otherwise its just a pretty place to tick off your list and say 'seen it'."

The harem rooms are probably the best. Lots of tour guide groups. Reasonable loos, always good. About 10 mins or more walk from the main square if you can cross the dangerous roads in one piece. A guided tour is ideal but you must take your guide with you."

We were amazed to see dozens of storks flying around and ten coming in to land on their nests. There was an iinteresting gallery of leading modern photographers with some really interesting and famous pictures e.g the famous one of Chrisitne Keeler on a chair from the 1960s. Quite strange to find it here."

The road is accessible and the cab should drop you straight outside. After paying the DH10 MAD entry fee you'll walk through the delightful gardens and enter the palace itself. A nice central courtyard awaits and there are lots of corridors to explore throughout the building. This should take you no more than thirty minutes to analyse and the visit may be a little too dull for some. Having been to Marrakech four times already, I left feeling that the Bahia Palace was 'nothing special', and that I had seen much of the same decoration and layout in other museums and buildings. Go if you have some time to kill, but I wouldn't advise people to venture out especially. If you're looking at the (more impressive) El Badi Palace, this is just three minutes away so see them both in a morning, then head down to the Djemaa el-Fna for a drink and some gelato."

Every aspect of the buildings, from the wood work of the windows to the ceilings structures, the mosaic tiles throughout the palace and the gorgeous lanterns were magnificent. The wood doors and stained glass windows were particularly impressive. These grounds have obviously been maintained over time and reflect the pride of Moroccans in their historical sites. Just walking through the courtyard compels your eyes to be drawn to so many architectural elements of the Palace. The various windows, particularly the stained glass windows, are something to see on a sunny day!This palace dates back to the late 19th century and was built to be one of the most impressive palaces of its time. I am sure that any occupant would have been quite pleased to wake up and walk around any part of these grounds. It appears that all of the rooms lead to the courtyard and would have lots of sun. The gardens are lush and lend a lovely fragrance to the Bahia Palace grounds.This is a nice site to take a leisurely stroll through and soak up the atmosphere."

The entrance is just a door in a wall and is only 10 dirhams to get in (about 80p), but it is stunning. The Palace is arranged around a central courtyard, and there are rooms with elaborately decorated wooden ceilings, beatiful stone carvings and tilework. It is not huge, and was named after the King's favourite wife. Well worth a visit!"

Although empty of furniture and drapes, the marble floors and tiled walls are wonderful but as you look up, the carved, painted and gilded ceiling decorations and plasterwork are sumptuous.Don't forget to look at the heavy wooden doors with their carved and painted decorations. One can only guess at the intrigues that went on in these rooms and the harem when the palace was in its heyday!Once again, no information on any of the rooms is available so you have no idea what they were used for, so hire a guide if you can who can hopefully bring the Palace to life."

He beetled back so fast he was a sweating wreck when he got there to be met by two old boys who regarded him with huge amusement. One started fanning him with his little white fez, saying \"don't worry, you left your camera, don't worry!\" The other old bod said \"you British?\" to which we replied \"yes\" and he then shouted\"British Airways\" and fell about laughing! Eventually the camera was retrieved from a cupboard while our friend was still roaring with laughter about his British airways joke. A lovely moment for us all.

It\u2019s not an old palace, compares to the other old buildings in town. It seemed run down. Because when the vizier died, enemies and wives stripped the palace bare. Also, big part of this 150 room palace is under renovation and not open to the public.Still, it\u2019s well worth visit. The garden and architecture is very beautiful, typical Moroccan style, courtyards and fountains, the wood carving, mosaics, painted ceiling... It was built by top artisans at the time.We had a very knowledgeable tour guide who told us the history and stories about this palace. We learned how to appreciate it even more!Only blind musicians could come in and performed in the palace, they don\u2019t want the musicians to see how luxury the place is. Because most of the people are very poor outside of the palace. All the male servants are eunuch. It surprised me, ancient China, Egypt, India\u2026.all had eunuch. Did the emperors/pharaohs/kings communicate before? Or it\u2019s just the cruelties of human nature?"

Hardly any signs or panels explaining what we are looking at, so I eavesdropped on some of the guides to learn the history and background. Worth paying for one to show you around the place. There is so much more trivia to learn than just reading a travel guide book. Different rooms have different facade and decor, and each room seem to have a history of their own."

We chose not to have a guided tour but then had to negotiate our way around multiple tour groups. We went in the morning before it became busy when this was ok, but I imagine it could become very tedious at busy times. The palace is very beautiful with typically Islamic decoration, though not on the same scale as somewhere like the Alhambra. Currently, only a small proportion of the palace and gardens are open to the public as there is restoration work being done on the rest. This means it is easy to get around at a gentle pace in an hour or so. I imagine that in the heat of summer it would, with its shaded courtyards, be a welcome retreat from the heat and noise of the city. Ladies, please note that if you want to use the toilets you have to pay the attendant 2Dh. Apparently there is no attendant in the Gents so they get to use the facilities for free."

We chose to walk around on our own, but still heard some interesting facts about this place. People who visited here, including movie stars when it was still occupied. This sultan had a large harem and nobody but himself could look at them. If one of the servants were to look at them they would be killed.

Unfortunately, a number of the written descriptions and photographs posted under Bahia Palace are for the El Badi Palace, which is larger larger but in poorer physical condition. Perhaps this error is due to the ease of getting lost in the medina or on the limited signage telling tourists where they are.

When we first walked up to the main building I commented that it 'wasn't exactly Buckingham Palace' but once inside I was amazed at the detail and intricacy of the rooms.It looks just as amazing in our photographs as it did in the flesh, which is something you can rarely say.Only 10 Dirham (less than a quid) and definitely worth spending an hour or so away from the chaos of the Medina."

This of course included the use of a guide. Upon entering the Bahia palace, you can see why/how it is a palace with it's stunning architecture and beautiful grounds. Unfortunately I was unable to hear what my guide was saying [majority of the time] specially as there was other groups of tourists browsing the Palace at the same time. However the place is quite poplar and can get very busy at times.Lovely palace to visit, specially for the all the photographs you can take, unfortunately there isn't really much else to see apart from the above!"

Without a guide the Bahia is interesting from the architectural viewpoint, but without any signage one doesn't learn much. A personal guide is well worthwhile, but be sure to avoid be brought into their favorite carpet, herbal or artifact shop. Visit the historic places with the guide, not the souk. The souk can be discovered alone."

On our visit in late November the place was almost deserted as well. We enjoyed admiring the traditional architecture - the intricate detailing of the ceilings, cornices and tiling etc. There is no signage or information (or none in English at least, and I saw only one sign in French) - I guess this is where a tour guide would come in handy to give you a little more insight into the purpose/history of each part, as the unfurnished rooms give little indication."

It was pleasant to walk around in november without getting hot and bothered and it wasn't too crowded either. You should definitely go if you're in Marrakech because its not like anything I've seen elsewhere. Great photo opportunities but nothing available to read or listen to to hear about the building if you're into the history.

Yes I totally agree, for 10 dirham it's a must whilst you're in Marrakech and yes, the architecture is amazing. Some of the tiling and wooden ceilings are absolutely beautiful and exquisite. All in all it was a very nice hour spent in there and I'm genuinely glad I went, but in the grand scale of all the magic Marrakech has to offer, I think it will quickly be forgotten when remembering my trip there.

Bahia Palace is pretty close to the main square, this attraction is in my top 3 of the most beautiful ruins I've visit!When you arrive you have to select if you want a ticket just for the Palace tour, or an upgrade that includes a visit to a small room where you can appreciate an ancient atrium from Koutoubia's mosqu\u00e9e. I heard some people complaining because they were expecting more from the upgrade tour but considering that we are not allowed in the Mosquees by not being Muslims it was nice to be able to see it and they have also some pictures from inside of the Mosquee, so it's your call.Besides the ruins with beautiful tiles there's another exhibition of Comtemporary Art included in the regular ticket.Before leaving make sure you get on the terrace to have full vision of the place, the view is breath-taking.Finally, when my friend and I were on our way out we found out there was a \"suggested route\" for the tour, a little too late for us, but if you go there you could try to follow the recommended path."

You will need to negotiate the narrow streets trying not to get run over by the hundreds of bikes that do drive through the souks, be aware at all times so please please do not think of using headphones walking around the souks, it can be pretty dangerous. The palace was so so, it was good that they have preserved their heritage, but toilets in this place are vile and they asked us for money as we left disgusted...sorry fix up your facilities and then maybe people would be happy to tip."

Bahia Palace, Marrakesh, a late 19th century palace was built by two generations of Alawi vizirs, Si Ahmed ben Moussa and his son, from approximately 1860 until 1900. The palace is an example of late Moroccan Andalusian architecture, combining in its decoration, the tension of geometry with the lushness of natural forms and contrasting the drama of private, interior labyrinths with the blaze of sun and blue sky in courtyards filled with birdsong and fountains. The palace, gardens and pavilions cover almost 8 hectare. Maze-like corridors connect intricately decorated rooms, brilliant with colored zellij (colored mosaics of fired clay tiles), plaster carving, painted and carved wood. The courtyard garden at the heart of the complex is an oasis of banana trees, orange, jasmine and cypress. Definitely worth spending a few hours; would have been helpful to have some more explanation, captions, perhaps a catalogue."

We visited other Kasbah's but this was the one that was the best preserved so I would say to visit this one and then you don't really have to visit anymore."

The bathrooms do not have a fee like people say- they have attendants who are happy if you give them some money for their work. Hand over 1/2 and you're fine...it's not demanded of you though. This is a nice place to stop in for a visit- you will get amazing photos."

Our guide would stand in an empty room and go on and on about what this room was for and who used it but it was pretty boring after a while looking at one vacant room after another. I think it would be okay to spend 30 minutes just wandering around here on your own but all the details from the guide were just too much. Not enough to see here for me."

Seeing as the charge for entry is so small, they don't half grumble if you only have notes in large denominations (as most of the tourists in our queue did). The palace is pretty small but the central garden is quite nice. All the rooms at which you are supposed to marvel are bare and plaster is falling off the walls. The toilets were terrible. All in all we were there for about 20 minutes, it's not worth going to such a horrible part of town for such a tiny adventure."

However, if you have limited time and/or interest, pick one and visit it. At a surface level, you see pretty much the same thing. In this case, it is entirely empty of any furniture, as when its last inhabitant died, his slaves and others stole everything. Best value is Thessalian Tombs - only 10 dirham."

The Bahia Palace is at the southern end of the Rue Riad Zitoun Jdid, and part of the fun in getting there (if you are coming from the northern end of Place Jemaa-el-Fna) is the walk along this narrow road to the palace. The road is lined with all sorts of interesting shops on both sides and there are intriguing alleys to explore off the side of this road. However it is not a quiet walk as it is a busy thoroughfare for motorcyclists, who I am sure can use other access roads but probably enjoy hassling the tourists who frequent this area.So when you arrive at the Bahia Palace the calmness that greets you is such a welcome relief. There are orange trees lining the entrance which when we visited were heavy with fruit. The palace itself is devoid of furniture, which is a shame, but the architecture is beautiful and there is still a lot to see - tranquil courtyards, ornate ceilings, intricately tiled floors and carved doors.It costs 10 dirhams to enter and if you are short of time, this is a much better attraction to visit than the Ben Youssef Merdesa or the Museum of Marrakech."

The tours are not guided and very little is off limits. This allowed me to stroll through the gardens, wander the halls and find something to see in every nook and cranny. The mosaic work is incredible. From the windows to the walls, the floors to the ceilings - the colorful tile and inlay dazzled the eye. Some rooms had ornate iron work for skylights and there were many Moroccan-style chandeliers to appreciate. There are many cats that wander the grounds. I was fortunate to be traveling with a Frenchman - so he read all the descriptive signs to me. Everything is in Arabic or French so hire an English-speaking guide if you want explanations. The palace is on the outskirts of the medina. Depending on where you are staying, it can be a lengthier walk. I recommend going in the morning when it is cooler and you have the most energy. The crowd is light and the morning breezes through the palace are lovely. From the palace you can work your way back through the colorful souks. It is an enchanting and serene experience to contrast with the bustle of the souks."

Later in our holiday we went on a guided half day tour of historical buildings and revisited the Bahia Palace. The guide was extremely knowledgeable about the history (only built in 19thC) and explained the decoration, translating the Arabic poetry included in the decoration and describing the use each room was put to. Well worth a visit (entry fee is very cheap) but worth having a guided tour if you want to know anything about the building. The building deserves a rating of 4/5 but is marred by lack of information."

This 19th-century palace, once home to a harem with 24 concubines, is a beautiful combination of painted and carved wood, ceramics, and symmetrical gardens. It was built in the late 19th century, intended to be the greatest palace of its time. The name means \"brilliance\". The building is an excellent example of Eastern Architecture from the 19th century that shows how the wealthy lived at that time. The detail may not be as rich as that found in earlier palaces, but it is nevertheless still significant. Make sure you look up at the smooth arches, carved cedar and beautifully painted ceilings, shiny marble finishes, and stucco plasterwork. The rooms vary in size according to the importance of each wife or concubine, and there are 160 rooms sprawled out in an open, rambling fashion. The reception halls and private quarters are lavishly decorated and there are several tiled courts \u2013 often complete with water features \u2013 that serve as open air areas where the women could have washed and rested themselves. We were fortunate to have the services of an excellent guide for our tour of the palace, which was great because with so many rooms and passageways, etc, it\u2019s probably very easy to get lost!

Many of the rooms open onto elaborate courtyards, complete with large water basins where the women likely bathed and gathered to gossip. If there is royalty visiting Marrakech they will stay at the palace and no tourists will be allowed, so take advantage when it's open. You will not be disappointed. My only complaint is that we saw so few of its 160+ rooms. If you're not with a tour group the fee is really reasonable, about 10 dirhams."

There are no descriptions or handouts on what rooms you are looking at, and there are no items to view outside of the typical cedar painted and carved moldings & plaster murals. If the personnel there had spent any time putting up some displays or paintings or something it would have held some kind of interest. Even if you speak French, there really is not much to read. We just sort of wandered around wondering - is this it? Dar Si Said instead, it's less than 5 minutes to walk to & for the same price you have some historical items to look at with the similar cedar carvings and painted tiles."

How else can one describe a palace that once used to host the heirs of throne, missing everything else than its walls? This is a skull of a wonderful princess that was dreamt to have, dared to look at, impossible to talk to. But just a skull, nothing else. Palais de Bahia reminds that something used to be there but these remnants fail to raise any feeling in the present.If you have nothing else to do, visit this skull of the princess, entry fee is very low, price is definitely worth the visit, time is not."

If you go with low expectations I'm sure you will not be disappointed however, as with all the sites I visited in Marrakech, it was not yet fully set up for tourists to walk round and understand the history and significance of the various rooms and elements of this attraction. If you are nearby it is worth a look as is not expensive however I wouldn't go out of your way."

The first open courtyard, mainly planted with orange trees and a marble fountain in the centre surrounded by rich arched woodwork with fine painted details is the older part of the palace, Dar Si Moussa was built by the first grand vizier (chief officer of the state) of the sultan. Bigger rooms with spectacularly detailed painted wood ceilings, equally beautifully adorned wooden doors and plasterwork on the archways can also been seen parts of which were built later by the son, Ba Ahmed the successor who built additions creating an intricate yet irregular plan to the final stages of the palace until it was completed in 1900. After his death, the sultan himself allegedly ordered a raid of the opulent Bahia Palace to collect its splendid furnishings and prized decorative materials."

The entrance to the palace is cheap (less than a pound) and there's a lot to see. Mostly this will appeal to people who love Islamic architecture and the palace combines many of the classical elements of Moroccan design. There are pretty courtyards and gardens, lavishly decorated rooms with ornate ceilings and colourful tiling and each room tends to be quite different from the others. We didn't hire a guide and didn't feel we needed one - we were happy to just wander around.The state of preservation is not as good as I'd have liked and I would happily have paid a higher fee if I thought more money would be spent to preserve this beautiful building.Watch out for tortoises in the gardens around the palace"

It reminded me of a country house in england on the approach by foot to this great walled and partially roped drive.But once through the first door, it was cooler than the heat outside, there were birds singing in the trees adorning the orangeries, and small courtyard gardens dotted about the palace.As I understood it, an over confident ruler lived in it, was overthrown and then eventually the locals at the time came and took anything that wasnt nailed down, or could be chipped-off. After I had left I came across a shop where the guy running it said the beautiful patterned tiles I was looking at and got me to venture inside, were genuine tiles from the palace.The tour is gently guiding you through in a one way direction. Within the palace is a series of galleried rooms, with smaller ones at each end and high arched ceilings. There was an enormous open courtyard which reminded me of the playground at school. Perhaps the heritage guardians of this palace could think of decorating it, and restoring some furniture and fittings so we could really see how it was. In one room were beautiful stained glass windows high up by the ceiling which were captivating all of us, as the palace had very little enduring decor left.The tiny gardens were the nicest parts, as they were so unexpected, and refreshing. You get a sense of imagining the Sultan striding through the very place you are standing and off into the grand room beyond the open doors. With fountains tinkling in the background, and the city with all its bustle not so far away, but at those moments a world away. It is this imagery that we expect of historical arabia, and this palace shows you a glimpse of it."
