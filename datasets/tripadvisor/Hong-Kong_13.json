Quite a number of steps to get up before you get there and along the way you have all these different gold buddhas. It was tiring by the time you got up the top but it was worth it. I would stop every so often, take pictures, admire the buddhas, etc. The temple at the top was beautiful as well. I thought this temple was better than some of the others I saw. Would very much recommend going. Take the MTR to get there, very close by."

I'd been to Hong Kong a few times and after visiting a couple of temples I thought I wouldn't again but I'm glad I eventually did this as it's nice to get away from the busy streets of Hong Kong and this has something different to offer over all the other temples in the busy areas. There aren't as many tourists and people visiting and the climb to the pop on a nice day offers quite a different view and something different to do/see. There are usually monkeys hanging around in the trees as you walk up too so keep and eye out and you may see a few, they blend in well but do come quite close sometimes. There is also a tower like building when you get to the top which you can actually go in and climb up if you want to go a little higher.One thing to watch out for is the fake monks just before you enter. They will act all kind and try to sell you bracelets and demand money in a bowl, do not fall for this as real monks will never beg for money. Just move past them and you'll be ok."

Hong Kong has these parks - like Kowloon Park - that are just beautiful - and beautifully tended - havens from the bustle that is so near. Hong Kong Park has some lovely water features - a waterfall, babbling brooks, a little lake."

In fact, none of the taxi drivers knew about it, so I recommend having the phone number handy for them to call.There is an Ancestor Worship Hall right next door which is also worth a few minutes exploration. The path to the Monastery is off to the right.The hike up the hill is cool, but a bit strenuous. It is lined the whole way with golden Bhudda statues. No two appeared to be alike to me. This goes for a mile or so I'd say. It is very quiet and lush jungle type scene.At the top, there is a Stella, and a number of Bhudda statues. The main hall has thousands of tiny lit buddhas. Living in China, I've done a number of Buddhist temples now, and this one is unique.It is a bit of a pain to get to, but worth the trouble. Oh, and it's free, which is nice."

We visited on a cloudy Thursday morning. It's a bit of an uphill walk up the steps of the monastery but this should not be an issue for those that are generally fit. You will find that you stop a lot on the way up (and down!) as you stop to admire and wonder at the various strange expressions and features of the statues. We saw a few monkeys at the start but none after that. There is a little pond right at the top level with fishes and turtles which pleased our boys! The views are really great and it's a lot quieter than the more popular attractions like the peak. We are glad we visited and would highly recommend it!"

At the top you will find a quaint place to site and get a cold drink and a snack. Beware of the monkeys. And look for the grottos with all the turtles inside. Highly recommend for a spiritual and cultural experience."

Both times, I remember the monastery being really hot and feeling quite tired when I reached the top. However, in my travels in Asia, I have not seen another monastery quite like the 10,000 Buddhas one. With so many different Buddhas, the artwork that went into making the temple is truly special. If you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of central Hong Kong, I would highly suggest traveling to the New Territories and the 10,000 Buddhas for a bit of tranquility in the mega metropolis."

The monastery itself was bigger than I expected and had lots to look around including the call with the 10,000 Buddhas itself. Make sure you continue up to see more halls, more Buddhas and great views! With the walk up and down and a good explore it took about 1.5-2 hours to wonder at own pace. Make sure you take plenty of water although you can buy from the small restaurant at the top if you forget. The monastery is open 9-5 and is free. Would definitely go again!"

But it worth to climb all those stairs. At the top of the path is the terrace with the main temple and a beautiful red pagoda. There is at the highest point a huge white Kwun Yam statue in front of a waterfall. It looks like from a fairytale.It is really nice place and I was very surprised, that weren't almost any people there. Maybe tourists don't know about this monastery, or they are lazy to climb all those stairs. :-)I can recommend to visit this place."

As others have mentioned, it's a bit tricky to find, but behind the government buildings there is a sign and an arrow leading to the path.The hundreds of monk statues lining the path up to the main pagoda and hall are only plaster, and have chipping paint, but were wonderful in their own regard. They were all unique, with different shapes, expressions, and props. The further you go up, the more impressive they become.At the top, (there are tons of stairs) there is a pagoda and a hall lined with possibly 10,000 small Buddha statues. There are also some toilets. No one was selling any water or food when we went, but there seem to stalls up there. We saw some monkeys in the trees, and many signs that saying not to feed them."

I was amused to see the \"Beware of fake Monks\" sign greeting me at the entrance( though no real or fake monks were anywhere to be seen)The trip up to the Monestary is quite the workout(over 400 steps) but the steps are lined by Buddha statues, so it is a picturesque walk upwards. Hiking up these steps in early July was quite tiring with the temperature and humidity both extreme, but the payoff comes at the top when a pretty Monestery is revealed and then further up more steps, a great view of the Monestery below and it really is quite relaxing. I would suggest to go early in the morning to avoid the heat in summer, and bring plenty of water."

It's quite a walk, especially at the height of the summer heat but well worth it!! There are even wild monkeys that come and walk around, jumping on the Buddhas and swinging on the trees, it's lovely to see them in their own habitat. They were minding their own business when we were there but I can imagine they could pester people. The monastery itself was absolutely incredible. The amount of detail that has gone into decorating each Buddha is amazing and it was lovely to see and smell the culture and religious atmosphere. The area itself had lovely views of the city and was a very peaceful area. Loved visiting this."

The pro's for visiting it: get to see the more traditional buildings on your way there, not so crowded, a nice walk in the shade. The cons: not so easy to find, the buddhas on the way up aren't anything wow-ish but they are an eye opener to human imagination. Take a mosquito replant and some water for the way up. Since we wandered about find our way there, some instruction to find the way as the residents of the neighborhood or people working there didn't know. Once you are next to the Grand Plaza Mall , head towards the Government Offices - there's a street in between the two so you have to walk that one for about 50m even though it looks like a dead end. As you reach the end head to your left on a shady path -- no worries you aren't lost. Walk that way and you will soon get some pavement under your feet to know you are on the right track. The way up starts just behind the Governmental offices and when we visited there were no signs. It is a peaceful location and gives a nice view over a part of Hong Kong. We didn't go up nor down to the memorial as it was extremely hot and were pressed for time."

After being ripped off by the Hong Kong MTR once again, we found ourselves outside yet another shopping complex studying the map on my phone to find the temple. After working out the direction, we set off in the right direction. We came to a path under a motorway bridge that the map said was there, and finally noticed the first sign for \"Ten Thousand Buddhas\" pointing us through some greenery towards what looked like a temple roof, above a small roadside shanty town. There had been no signposts for the monastery anywhere near the MTR station, and it was not located on the station map of the local area. Even in the Grand Plaza, there was no indication of where the monastery was. We followed this one sign up the only path, until we came to a staircase.The staircase led us past a few Buddha statues, and after an exhausting climb, to a platform with several rows of rather colourful small Buddha statues along the cliff side. Another flight of stairs brought us to the top, where a very modernised tiny one-room shrine housed a great many Buddhas... In the form of wall carvings. They were all identical, and they were all tiny. We left after five minutes, disappointed. Upon getting back to where we were staying and looking at the photos on TripAdvisor, I am left slightly confused. None of them seem to be of the temple we encountered (though half of them seem to be of Po Lin monastery on Lantau Island for some reason), although the place we found was in the right map location, and at the dead end of the road directed to us by the only signpost available. Do both TripAdvisor and Google have the temple in the wrong location? If not, and we did still somehow manage to get to the wrong place, it is nigh impossible to find due to poor signposting locally, and for us was a complete waste of time, energy, and money."

I was greeted with an amazing sight of statues lining the steep path, helped by 431 steps from the base of the hill up to the Monastery, and surprised to find monks not buddhas, each with different expressions, poses and dress. So I must correct everyone regarding the 500 \"buddhas\" that lines the path up to the monastery. They are life size gilded Arhan statues. Arhan, is the local word for \"buddhist monks\" who are very senior and can serve the buddhas. We were climbing the hill on a relatively warm and humid day, so dread to think those who climb in the heat of summer, when temperatures can reach 40\u00b0C, would probably die of heat exhaustion! Definitely, need to remember to carry a few bottles of water with you. By the time we reached the lower level of the monastery (it is built over two levels overlooking Sha Tin), I was glad to find a large dining room of the vegetarian restaurant right in front of us, where we can have a cold bowl of sweet grass jelly dessert, the sweetness of the syrup helped to replace the perspiration from our glowing bodies and the coldness to cool us down.After suitably cooled we ventured out to the building next door, the main attraction, which was The Ten Thousand Buddhas Temple. This temple is amazing as its walls are covered with miniature Buddhas, all unique, all handmade, on 30 shelves (yes, I counted!) rising from the floor to ceiling, each bearing an inscription of the name of its donor. The buildings of the Monastery took eight years to complete, but it took a further ten years to complete all the miniature Buddha statues displayed, and which actually numbered almost 13,000 (in Cantonese words \"ten thousand\" simply represents a term for an extremely large number). In the centre of this Temple, in a glass case, resides the body of the founder of the Monastery, Rev Yuet Kai, embalmed with lacquer and gold leaf, adorned in robes, and seated by the altar, with a sign that reads, \"The Diamond Indestructible Body of Yuet Kai.\"At the opposite end of the Temple, on this large terrace, is the nine storey pagoda and in between is a pavilion housing a large statue of the Goddess of Mercy. Apparently, the pagoda was featured on the HK$100 note.On the upper level, the path leading up is lined with goddesses this time, there are more temples and a turtle pond, and views across to Sha Tin from the waterfall, in front of a large white statue of a Goddess, which looks relatively new."

I didn't pay attention and just grabbed a taxi. Three min later I was there. Noticed the sign when I returned. The entrance is not well marked. There is a large marble wall with its entrance flanked by big stone lions. That is not the entrance because thAt is for a cemetery. To the right of the marble wall is an alley between the parking lot and government building. Walk down it and then you will see the sign sitting on the ground leaning against a post. Then keep walking up many many stairs up the side of the mountain flanked by 10,000 Buddhas in all shapes and sizes and postures. Some were actually quite funny. The view at the top is beautiful. Lots to see. No one or no signs that offer any guidance or history. But view is nice and you just need to do your research before to know what you are looking at. Took about 45min to hike up with a few breaks thrown in. Wear light clothing and take some water."

This Monastery is hard to find, there are no signscoming from the train its apprx less than 10 min walk but again there are no signs, we had to ask for directionsfirst we though we arrived but than we found out it was a cemetery which looked like a temple entrance next to the cemetry is a house and a wall you have to go through the isle maybe 3 min walkIt doesn't really look nice and we weren't sure that it was the right entrance till we saw the sign.Wow seeing all the gold statues was amazing !!!Beware its a steep climb up and you need to have a good fitness level and good shoesIt was boiling hot when we visited but it was all worth it.make sure you are going right up to the top where you have to climb more steep steps but on the way you can rest on even ground and see all the temples and Statues insideWe loved the place but we were really exhausted.Its a long steep uneven pathway with steps. But a beautiful scenery"

The place was almost totally empty and the rain made it so peaceful and relaxing. Rain or shine though, I highly recommend this place if you are interested in Buddhist shrines and temples. I have been to so many all over Asia and this ranks among my top few. Prepare for a bit of a hike up the hill. It's not bad, but could be a real challenge for elderly or physically impaired."

You climb around 400 steps in a concrete path with life-sized golden painted bouddha statues on your sides. And you reach 4 (5?) temples, pavillons and a pagoda. It is supposed to be founded in the 50s, but everything had been (re)built within the last 10 years.Not especially well maintained either. And not recommended when it rains (risk of landslide?)It is not one of the best of Hong Kong"

There are other figurines around the building. as you walk up higher, there is another temple building and a large sleeping Buddha on the right side. there is another short walk up some stairs on the right side where there is a figure with a waterfall in the back. very beautiful. alongside is also buddhas in the forest.

We combined visiting this monastery with the Nan Lian Gardens and nunnery. The Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery is not that easy to find. Exit the MTR station and walk with the crowd past the open shopping area. You will see a large shopping mall ahead of you. Right before the mall, make a left and walk to the end to the road. There is a government facility here which you might think is the monastery. Instead take the small pathway to the right and you will see small sign leading you to the Ten Thousand Buddhas. The walk uphill is not easy but take you time and enjoy the variety of golden buddhas along the way. On the top of the hill, we enjoyed the temple, surrounding buildings and the views."

There are two ways up hill, the stairway with all the Buddha statues and another short cut.

The walk was good, each buddha is different and some are quite funny. This makes the walk a bit more interesting, as on a humid hot day, the walk can be a bit taxing!I didn't walk the whole way to the top, I stopped at the monastery. It was excellent.The level of detail is excellent, the views are brilliant, and all of the colours are so vibrant. Inside the monastery, it is very impressive and also very calming, much like the whole area. It is one of the most impressive temple areas I have seen in Hong Kong, maybe because it is quieter and so vibrant. It is nice just to walk around.I did not have anything to eat as I went in the later end of the day as it was closing, but that was quite nice as the crowds had died off.I would say only do the walk if you are fit enough,if you want to take photos, do so discreetly as there are many signs advising against photos, and the same goes for when you pose with the buddhas, it is frowned upon.Easy enough to get to from the MTR station, just make sure you dont make the same mistake I did, as it isn't sign posted, so walk past the entrance where you think it should be, follow the metal fencing and soon you will see the buddhas.Also, watch out for the many many monkeys!"

Here if one goes right one finds an ipper Gorge with a Statue of Kwun Yam above a waterfall. to the left is the way to the Ten Thousand Buddha Hall. along the way are more Golden Buddhas & Devas. There is also a small terrace with a number of (non-gilded) Buddhas.Reaching the Main Plaza there is the Main Hall (13K miniature Buddhas in here give the the name to the Monastery), the Nine Storey Pagoda and a number of other Pavilions.Directly from here is an alternative route back down to Sha Tin with a few motre Golden Buddhas"

It is an incredible site, and there are other shrines at the top, plus a view of the surroundings. This is a must see in Hong Kong and worth the walk. Another important note, the monastery closes at 5:00, which means they shut various gates at 5:00, so you could enter the base at 5:00, but get to the top and have it shut. Plan enough time! Also, on the way down, after the monastery had closed, there were dozens of monkeys around the base of the path."

Right at the top, towards the left is main temple area and to the right (walk up a few more steps) some more Budhas and small temple complexes.

At the end of the road there's a small traffic circle and a poorly marked path that leads to the trail. If you see escalators up a mountain you've missed the turn.

The street up to the temple takes 20 to 30 minutes and is not too exhausting. I didn't count the buddhas, but there are a LOT of them. Is it 10,000, I don't know... but very nice to see. The temple itself is quite nice, and is truly used for prayers by locals, so it's not a hollow place where only foreign tourists go and buy t-shirts. The backside of the temple also offers a nice view of the valley. There was one thing that kind of took me out of the experience. The preservation of the temple isn't perfect. You start reaching the temple road between fences, and some of the buddha status, if not most, are a bit decrepited and run-down, with the golden coating coming off. The feeling was a bit similar in the actual temple, making it a bit hard to feel the holiness of it all. Still worth a visit!"

From Pai Tau Street (a short walk from Shatin MTR station), turn right onto Sheung Wo Che Road. At the dead end of the road, turn left into some trees and there is a trail that picks up behind the government offices which is not labeled. Once finding it, the hike is pretty amazing as the buddhas go on for what feels like forever up the climb. Each statue is unique and has its own personality. I had the place to myself going on a weekday which made it even more special. At the top of the climb, there are some temples and a place to buy drinks and snacks. Keep climbing a little further to make it to the fish pond, water fall, and beautiful view. Make sure to take water with you because the steps can be intense in the humid weather."

Warning - it's a bit of a climb up - be prepared for a good workout. Once you get there, it is pretty peaceful and the 10000 statues are a sight to behold. Gets pretty hot in the summer - be forewarned. That is true for all of Hong Kong - especially if you have to walk."

We decided to do it this year on the first day of the Chinese New Year holidays because we wanted to do something spiritual to mark the start of the new year. It is a bit difficult to find as there are no signposts but locals were helpful with directing us to the path. We drove to Shatin and parked in the shopping centre carpark right next to the entrance. The walk up is quite steep but there are resting points along the way. It's amazing to see all the different Buddhas along the way, each with an individual facial expression, size, etc. The view from the top is also worth the effort. We had bought incense sticks and lit them in front of the temples at the summit. There's a local restaurant but we didn't try it. Well worth a visit - if only once!"

I usually don't have much time to sight see in Hong Kong but I had a day off and wanted decided part of the day would be spent at Ten Thousand Buddhas. As other reviewers mention, it is a tiny bit hard to find but take MTR E Rail to Sha Tin station and follow blue gov signs.....enjoy the journey finding it. There are lots of stairs and you are headed up so if you are pushing a stroller or have problems walking you will need to plan for more time. It was a little overwhelming seeing all the Buddhas....I always get asked \"were there really 10,000...\". According to the literature, there are actually 12,800 Buddhas but I didn't count. At the top there are several monasteries, a small informal restaurant (didn't try) and a gift shop. The views from the top are beautiful. As it is a place of worship it is a nice place to sit quietly, enjoy the view and reflect. It is free of charge but there are several places you can make a donation. I say it's good for anyone (who can make the climb) and understand the overall atmosphere is on the quiet side."

The path to the Ten Thousand Buddha Temple is actually the path on the right hand side of the green fence separating PFS (left hand side is the car park entrance to PFS). If you look carefully the hand-written sign showing the way to Ten Thousand Buddha Temple is place near the floor on the green fence! The other way to the entrance was though the tree path at the end of the first street before reaching PFS.On the way up to the temple is a steep path with golden monks/deities (not Buddhas!) on both sides each with a unique expression and pose which we found amusing and fun rather than spiritual. There were seats periodically set out on the sides for visitors who need a rest.At the top is where is temple complex resides. From the top of the mountain we could see PFS and the rest of Shatin down below. It was genuinely awarding to see. Those who seek to worship Buddha or give charity may enter the large temple. Taking pictures aren't allowed inside. There is a small vegetarian restaurant too but we found it a bit pricey. But not as pricey as Po Lin at Lantau Island.Near the back of the area are steps which lead down back the mountain. Around here there are lots of monkeys jumping around. While not aggressive the larger ones did look like they didn't want to be disturbed. We didn't go all the way down the steps as we saw it headed to some village rather than back to the town center. We asked a couple of visitors on the way up where the steps led to and they confirmed it led to \"no where but some quiet village\" and they \"learned the hard way by going down there\".There are toilet facilties and lots to see at the temple but not much to actually do. I don't think it's a place for kids but it's a good visit to occupy the first half of the day if you haven't got much to do in NT area or Shatin - it is a temple after all not Ocean Park! Do make sure you have the right footwear and clothes to walk up there!"

It felt a far more scared place than Big Buddha and was more about creating an accessible open sacred place. It is free but think of it like a cathedral that suggests donations without even suggesting how much like the UK. The 10,000 Buddhas is about remembering loved ones, in the halls each Buddha is linked with a remembered person. A Very special place.2) finding the right entrance !to say it's difficult to find the right entrance is an understatement, so here goes with my definitive guide :) The hundreds of steps up is lined with quite a few of the10,000 Buddhas the way to the proper route up is:a) Exit A2 at the station and turn left down the covered ramp down to street levelb) Follow it and cross over to the entrance of the Home Square Centre (and IKEA large sign) c) Don't go in, turn left signed for Sha Tin Govt Offices. You will have the football pitch on your left go down until you reach the council officesd) Turn left at the Sha Tin Govt Offices down Sheung Wo Che Road go right to the end e) The entrance to the car park is on your rightStraight ahead is the unmarked entrance to the temple f) The welcome sign is attached to a fence around the corner ! g) You can come back this way or for a quicker descent there is an exit in the large square at the far end from the Temple.Hope that helps, it took me 40mins to find."

You will find it by exiting on the left side of the MTR and going left towards the mountain adjacent to the station. It is past a soccer court and you will then see some rather small signs guiding you to the stairs. Once there, you are greeted with a funky vibe that I would expect from an American roadside attraction. These aren't all just regular Buddhas. I found one with 5 foot eyebrows, a Mr. Fantastic rubber armed one, and one that looked like a demon with arms coming out of its eyes. A lot of fun to poke around and see these silly statues. Additionally, on one side of the mountain, you'll find wild monkeys. This attractions is a little away from city center but easily accessed by MTR. I recommend going if you like odd attractions. If you do not, stick to the main part of town."

The Buddha lined path going up to the Monestary is the real attraction. To see a few hundred life-sized incarnations of the Buddha in various forms (a Roman Buddah, a Japaese Samuri Buddah, a super tall Buddah next to a short rolly-Polly Buddah) gets one thinking of his many incarnations and life experiences the enlightened one had been through. Too bad none are women, but we live in a sexist world, right? The walk up the Monestary is a nice little workout, not too hard, but not for the frail. The 10,000 Buddahs refers to the 12,00 or so small ones in the temple at the top for what it's worth. The founders remains are preserved in the temple and you might miss that if you don't look for it.Now, what you should also know is that right next door is a mausoleum complex/cemetery well worth a visit--that one could combine with your Monestary visit. It is also up on the hill with its own funicular and escalators to ascend--so you don't have to do the climb a second time--but you can't cross over from the masoleums to the Monestary unless you can pick locks or leap over barbed wire. I accidentally went up the funicular elevator thinking I was going to the 10,000 Buddah Monestary missing the small sign pointing to the Monestary at the entry to the cemetery. The site is a complex of open rooms with plaques memorialize the dearly departed with funerary offering ovens nearby. Relatives come to pay respects and burn offering for their loved ones. it is customary to burn paper simulacrum like money, cars, cell phones, and watches so the spirits may have these things in the afterlife. On my visit, there seemed to be grocery-bag sized parcels of unknown contents being burned. The masoleums are not a tourist attraction, so behave with quiet deference."

Along the way you will see many Golden Buddha statues, each with different look.When you get to the top (actually only about 2/3rd up since they built more stuff further up) you will see the main temple and the vegetarian canteen and more statues.Further up more temples, statues of all kind and at the end there is a female Buddha (see photo).I also attached a photo of worker with Motorized cart going up deep slope. That's how they transport goods up and down daily.Vegetarian meals are decent, standard fare.All in all a nice visit on a beautiful weather day."

The path is lined with the 10,000 statues painted gold, each one different from the other. There may be people who look like monks trying to sell trinkets, but they are not monks.Some parts of the trail are quite steep and we had to stop and rest several times. The first plaza has a large temple. Buy incense here to place at several incense burners around the plaza.

Whenever I'm in Hong Kong, I tend to stay in my ancestral village in Sha Tin, which, as you travellers will know, is in the New Territories.Now, I've heard about ten Thousand Buddha Monastery, but I've just never been, I always found myself in other areas of Hong Kong - TST, Mong Kok, Lan Kwai Fong, you know, that kind of place. It was, however, on a lazy free Sunday, on a very recent trip, that we decided to actually visit the monastery.We caught the bus into Sha Tin New Town Plaza, headed for the MTR station and Exit B and managed to find the place using instructions from a previous review on Tripadvisor. For such a location it's a bit odd that it isn't readily signposted, in fact, I don't think I saw any signs that we were in the right place except at the foot of the stairs leading up to the monastery...As we began our trek upwards we were met with three \"monks\", one of whom was about to offer me his beads (presumably in exchange for money), but luckily we already knew that the monastery, despite its name doesn't actually have any resident monks. The site is apparently maintained by volunteers, so don't be fooled, they're not monks, they're scam artists out to separate you from your cash.Anyway, the walk up to the monastery wasn't as \"gruelling\" as I was led to believe, however, I imagine it being a bit tougher in the height of summer - we went in late November at a temp of around 24 degrees celsius, and although we were sweating and out of breathe by the time we reached the monastery, it's well within the ability of most.You can approach the walk in two ways - the steep stairs or the steep ramps, we did a bit of both, mostly to stop and take pictures or to avoid people doing the same, as, on your way up the 431 step climb you path is lined with about 500 life sized \"gold\" Arhan statues, each one apparently different, though I could swear I saw some repeats, with some really \"freaky\" ones dotted about - we saw some stood on top of fish, some with multiple faces, and one with arms coming out of his eye sockets... Yes, you read the last one correctly.Every now and then you get seats on your way up if you need to stop to take a breather, however, once at the top of this path you're greated by the Monastery itself, which is indeed packed with approximately 13,000 (I didn't count, but they were stacked from floor to very high ceiling) little Buddha statues. Also in the monastery is the corpse of the monastery's founder Reverend Yuet Kai sat in a glass case.Just across from the monastery is the Kwun Yam (The Goddess of Mercy) Pavilion, a 9 storey Pagoda (which we weren't allowed in), there's a vegetarian restaurant, cases features more statues, oh and monkeys. Macaques specifically...I had no idea that the site was home to monkeys. We witnessed them taking fruit from bags that visitors had brought with them as offerings to the Gods/Goddesses, we even saw one \"attack\" someone, but it was chased off by a worker who threw a broom at it. However, mostly the monkeys only interaction is to wander around you to see if you have any food - so try not to have any food or even carrier bags with you if you visit. I had no idea that monkeys were that close to the city, I just assumed that they were concentrated in the various country parks such as Lion Rock and Kam Shan...Continuing up wards we were met with a giant Kwun Yam Statue sat by a waterfall, however, we couldn't get too close as part of the area was closed off for repairs or construction I presume. However, there are more golden statues and an area packed with tortoises.Whilst on the upper terrace you can get some breathtaking views of Sha Tin.Ten Thousand Buddha Monastery is well worth a visit (it's free so why not?) and should be considered in your itinerary for your visit to Hong Kong."

Beware of the fake monks outside the monastery who prey on visitors."

The ten thousand Buddhas monastery is also sign posted on the way out of the station. Follow the road down and to the left. Before you get to the end of the road you'll have the government and tourist info on your right with a small road with a roundabout at the end with the ikea/shopping centre next to it. Go right to the end and there's a small passage that leads to the entrance. If in doubt go and ask in information!The monastery is quite something. The climb isn't too bad and there's loads of Buddhist statues to help you on your way. Once at the top there's a temple with a small gift shop, toilets and a vegetarian restaurant. There's loads of amazing statues. The view is excellent. If you go up more stairs there's a second level with again brilliant views and more temples. There's also an outside water feature with a big statue and a fish pond. It's really relaxing.We weren't harassed by fake monks - didn't see any. I got bitten by insects so make sure you have some insect repellent! This is slightly out of the way but didn't cost much at all on the MTR and took about 50 mins to reach."

Perhaps it's a little off the beaten path for typical visitors to HK but totally worth the effort to get there and see! It was really great to get out of the hustle and bustle of downtown and see a different side of Hong Kong. It was easy enough to get to, just a five minute walk from an MTR station. The hike up to the monastery itself probably isn't for the infirm or anyone pushing a stroller, but for the moderately healthy/in shape person is great! Plus there is so much to see on the way up you can take your time! Even though it's call ten thousand buddhas there are actually more like 23,000 of them on the premises. The view from the top is beautiful and the whole experience was so peaceful and wonderful. I'm SO glad I made the effort to visit while in HK! You won't be disappointed."

This was the highlight of my trip to Hong Kong and best of all getting here was very easy.Take the MTR to Sha Tin Station, exit B and walk down the ramp to the left, follow this down to Pai Tau Street which veers left and continuing along Pai Tau street a short walk brings you to Sheung Wo Che road on the right, cross the road and walk to the end of this street about 50 metres on the left you come to a dead end and a wire fence, turn left and follow the path a little way and turn right between the wire fence and you will start to see the golden buddahs.It is really very quick, took my daughter and I about 10 minutes to find the beginning of the climb up to the top from Sha Tin MTR station.I am very unfit but I walked up the 468 steps without a problem, I didn't even puff and pant like I thought I would. There is a hand rail all the way to help you if you need it and seats to stop and rest if you get tired. I didn't sit once, I am 51 and a little overweight and unfit, so believe me if I can do it 'anyone' can do it lol !The buddahs are amazing and so well made, each one has a different expression. The walk up didn't seem to take long at all as I think I was just too impressed taking photos and amazed with all the buddahs, around every turn was a whole new lot of buddahs.At the top was an impressive red pagoda and amazing views over Sha Tin.The main building was filled with small buddahs without a gap between them, unfortunately there is no photography allowed in here.I pushed my luck and got a photo that I zoomed in from outside just to show how many there were.We were forewarned about the fake monks that lurk around the trail asking for money on the way up, we were surprised when we didn't see any but on the way down, there they were, so we quickly walked past and ignored them.There are warning signs everywhere explaining about the fake monks !! This place is definitely worth a visit, you wont be disappointed."

There is another monastery at the base and many tourists get confused and go there. The walk to the top of the temple takes around 30 mins and its lined with golden colored statues of buddhas. Once you reach the top of the mountain, there is a beautiful hall with 10,000 small statues of the Buddha in different poses. Also in the center are large statues that are majestic. There is a small vegetarian restaurant at the top where you can have some good food. Overall a recommended visit if you want to experience the calmness and peace of a Buddhist monastery."

However he wanted to share this love with everybody and therefore he spend eight years to build up/create this place. You will find here more than 10k Buddhas and a temple. But before you reach this temple you have to climb up the mountain; only 430 steps. It sounds a lot, but in real life it is easier than you might think. Unfortunately I wasnt lucky; when I arrived at this place it started to rain. Try to visit this place when it is sunny; you will have a great view from the top of the mountain.There is no entrance fee; you can visit this place free of charge.I was surprised to hear that most of the locals dont know this place.

At the top you can catch a great view, there is a reasonably priced vegetarian restaurant, turtle and carp pond, places to sit and relax, and the temple itself is lovely!!As you walk up, it's worth bearing in mind that the founder and his disciples apparently carried all the original building materials up manually, despite the fact that he was 70+ years old :)"

Very, very impressive.You're not at the top yet, but here you will also find basic refreshments and toilet facilities if you need them.Onwards and upwards. Through the continuing buddha guard of honour. At the top there is a waterfall (artificial, not natural) cascading into a well-stocked Koi pond. More views over the town, more buddhas (larger, this time) to enjoy the view with you. You have walked up 324 steps to get here, or you've pushed a wheelchair up the adjacent ramp.

Path you need is a lane running to the right, do not mistake entrance to graveyard as the path - this has a white gate and an escalator going up.When you do find correct path BEWARE THE FAKE MONKS who prey on westerners, they'll try and shove bracelets on your arms etc and charge you for them. Just ignore them, push them off. Happened to us today but we knew in advance.Climb up to the top does make you break a sweat but it's not horrendous (I've done far worse in other parts of Asia). If you're of average fitness you'll be ok. Bring a bottle of water on hotter days.Path is lined with gold figurines, all with their own unique character. Atmosphere slightly ruined by all the selfie sticks that inevitably dominate at tourist attractions now. Actual temple, pagoda and halls are colourful and pleasant but nothing out of the ordinary. If you have been to a few temples in Asia this is a very bog standard modern example. Vegetarian restaurant is reasonably priced and food was quite decent. We ate lunch there.

I loved looking at all the different buddhas in different shapes and sizes. The climb to the top is definitely worth it. The view at the top wasn't that spectacular, but I did manage to get some great pictures. It's not a must-do attraction, but if you have extra time I would do it."

Firstly, there are quite a few instructions available on the interwebby thing as to how to get there, I hope these are the most accurate, AFAIK, go to Shatin on the MTR, take exit B and turn hard left, walk straight ahead then turn right onto the ramp which takes you down to street level, the Pai Tau villiage will be on the left of you. As you reach the Grand Central plaza directly ahead of you, turn left into Pai Tau St, walk about 50 mtrs, cross the road and make a right turn into Sheung Wo Che Rd, walk down past the Government offices, and follow the small path at the left hand side where the street ends, a few meters up the path you will see the yellow 10,000 Buddhas sign. Sorry to repeat these instructions here, but I stopped to help several groups on the way back who were lost, so help this helps you find the way.  Now the hard part, I visited on a hot muggy day about 10am, and found the stairway quite a challenge in the heat, you will need lots of water and frequent stops on the way. I keep pretty fit and climbed the stairs in about 10 minutes, but passed one group on the way who had given up and turned back, not an easy climb in the heat. Please dont let the climb put you off, its worth it, the monastery is amazing, very serene and peaceful and you can buy a cold drink at the cafe there, and yes there really are over 10,000 buddhas. Stop in the airconditioned comfort of the Grand Central plaza to cool off on the way back, before heading back to the MTR. Hard to find but worth the effort."

The walk up is steep and about 400 steps so I recommend wearing decent shoes. Take some water as its abit of a trek and hot. It closes at 5pm so I advise going well before to have a decent look around. There is mosquitoes so be warned I usually don't get bitten but these ones seemed to love me. I enjoyed the walk around, the Buddhas are all made from gold coloured plastic and there is a lot of them all with different expressions. I wouldn't say this attraction is amazing if your into temples I preferred the Chi Lin Buddhist nunnery and bonsai gardens in diamond hill, Kowloon its stunning and seemed a lot less tacky."

There are no signs or directions but our gps confirmed we had arrived. We asked 2 people sitting on their bikes if we were close but they did not know eiither. We ventured around the corner and went down the path about 50 metres then saw some gold glittering in the filtered sun. This had to be it. It was. We were greeted by life-sized and very realistic statues of Buddha lining the path. We assumed that 10,000 was a generalistion but really there are more than 10,000. On the walking path itself which is quite steep, there are about 400. Each one is different and that is amazing in itself but the eyes of the staues also seem to follow you-or maybe that was just the effect of this spiritual place. Nearly at the top, there is a praying place and inside are thousands of Buddha statues around the 4 walls-another mind-blowing sight. There is a vegetarian restaurant at this level and it provides a good range of welcome refeshments. We decided not to go to the very top because of the steep incline and our time commitments but imagine the views over local shatin mountains would have been worth the extra effort. Be aware that this attraction is suitable for generally fit and able people. The path is steep and in places the handrails have been removed."

The hike up is tiring and with the humidity a bit uncomfortable, took plenty of water. The way we went up was a steadier slope and step access it was shaded more with plateaus to rest. From the bottom of the walk up to the top it was decorated either side with golden coloured statues.Ignore the fake buddist monk at the bottom greeting you. Once up the top there are some temples and a great view. On this level there is a little refreshment place selling cans and water. Cans were $10HKD. Go up to the next level more steps and golden statues to more temples.Photographs in some of the temples was not allowed at all. The route we took up...take MTR to Sha Tin station and take exit B. This is where quite a few buses are parked up. Walk to the left down the slope and head towards the shopping centre you will see a sign with Ikea on it. Turn left into Pai Tau Street ( you are then walking in front of the shopping centre), walk towards the Sha Tin Government building and turn right down this street called Sheung Wo Che Road. Do not mistake the cemetery for the temple which is in Pai Tau Street beyond the government building. As you walk along Sheung Wo Che Road you will see car parks on the right and left at the end of this road. In the left hand corner at the bottom you will see some metal railings snd see the start of the walk and the golden statues...there was the fake monk in grey at the entrance.....on the way back down we took some steps to the left of the toilets on the first level..these are very steep and would not be a pleasant way up but a quicker route down, there are hardly any statues lining this walk down.

One of the most dramatic sacred sites in Hong Kong, the Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery is perched at the top of a hill in the town of Sha Tin, and visitors must climb more than 400 stairs to reach the temple and the famous nine-storey pagoda. The monastery actually contains nearly 13,000 buddha statues within its walls alone, and many more stand sentinel along the pathways and stairs. The statues come in a great variety of shapes, postures and sizes and the temple complex is breathtakingly colourful with beautiful views. Unlike many famous temples in Hong kong, the Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery has retained its tranquil atmosphere and still feels like a holy place; it is not commercialised and is seldom swamped by crowds. This is partly why it tends to make such an impression on tourists. There is a small restaurant selling simple refreshments at the top but it is advisable to bring your own water for the climb, which some find tiring. In some parts of the complex photography is not allowed - be sure to take note of the signs.In early 2013 the very top section was being renovated and it is now ready. It is a tall white statue of a lady Buddhist. Very scenic. When you exit from Sha tin station it's a ten minute walk. Go to the Sheung Wo Che road. The road will end abruptly and onto the left of the dead end there is a muddy pathway which will take you to the monastery. Please don't miss this."

It is not a real monastery and you won't find Monks here or anything like that. Once the rain stopped for a second, my husband and I decided to give it a go and took the train, which was a neat experience, to the area. Once getting off the train we walked to the monastery. You could see it on the hills. We ended up walking up one way, getting drenched in a short downpour, which almost deterred us from continuing. As you ascend you are walking through some desolate neighborhood, which was quite interesting and worth some pictures to the steps. Once you reach the steps you begin the see the golden colored statues, which continue with more frequency on your trek upwards. You will finally reach the \"plateau\" where you are greeted with some more statues and a pagoda, which was closed during our visit as they are renovating. We stopped at the little cafe, as I needed a break after the walk ( I need to get back in shape, whew). In the cafe we were approached by the owner/waiter who quickly dipped a cup in a bowl of steaming water in front of us ( apparently to clean it), then poured us some tea. I was pretty thirsty and didn't mind drinking the tea. We ate some sort of vegetable spare ribs??? and spring rolls, all very interesting and tasty. It is a vegetarian restaurant. We didn't get sick, so kuddos :-).... We then explored the statues and climbed some more stairs to the waterfall ( don't stop at the restaurant)..It was very serene and not packed with tourist. I loved looking at the different expressions of the statues and relaxing by the Koi pond at the base of the waterfall. There was another way up and down to both the waterfall area and to the temple itself. As we were tired an a little afraid of getting lost we opted to go back down the way we came rather than through another path with even more statues ( my husbands request, I was all for the adventure :-) I think it was an excellent day trip one I would highly suggest!"

I climbed in the middle of the afternoon after having taken the east line metro and alighting at ShaTin station. The entrance to the monastery is hidden away behind the Grand plaza between the mall and its car park. Taking the road between the Sha Tin government offices and the mall leads you to a tiny board directing you to the monastery. The skyline view from the upper level is beautiful. The religious craft is well visible at both levels. The 9 storeyed pagoda overlooking the Hong Kong skyline is a must visit. The faithful have plenty of crafts available to purchase and also free material to read on Buddhism. A place not to be missed while visiting hong kong."

The Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery is defintely one of the top 2 temples in Hong Kong to visit. it is within walking distance from the Sha Tin MTR station in the New Territories is one of Hong Kong\u2019s most famous Buddhist temples. There are several different levels on the grounds with over 500 gold statues and 400 steps lining the path to the main (1st) level. The main level has the primary temple, several pavilions, statues and a beautiful 9-storey pagoda which is featured on the HK $100 bank note. The 2nd level, up about 50 more stairs has several more pagodas and a beautiful garden area with a small waterfall, a large white Buddha statue and many more golden statues scattered through the garden area.I imagine this would be a tougher place to visit with small children or elderly although there are both stairs and a ramp / hill so if you have a stroller or wheel chair and can push it up, it is possible but would be quite demanding physically. There is no elevator or tram to get up and it is a bit difficult to find. there is also another small garden area next door with an escalator and small tram but that is not the monastery ... you have to walk to the right of that garden area through a small passage and then you will see all the golden statues which start the stairs / path to the monastery. Lastly, there is a small restaurant and shop at the main level to get water, especially important for the hot and humid summer days in Hong Kong. They also serve food if you are hungry for a snack."

There are even benches to facilitate a rest. In late May there were mosquitoes a plenty. Be prepared!We got lost (just a little) but the reward was seeing how people were living on the edges of a highly urbanised environment. It was much more like a village existence with small, slightly primitive housing, lots of trees and undergrowth, open streams and narrow paths. No cars at all. Quite the antidote to days in Kowloon and on HK island! The monastery itself is worth a visit - other reviewers have done it more justice.There is a 'back gate' to the monastery which takes you in the direction of the MTR via a slightly different route. Arrive one way, depart the other. You may even see a small temple near the MTR ...right next to a pizza joint. Whatever you do, enjoy the journey, not just the destination (and take insect repellent)."

We just loved every minute. It's the most visually busy place we have visited! Stunning hills, stunning temples and most amount of Buddhas we have ever seen. Keep walking up to next level and there are more beautiful things to look at.We loved it. It's about 20mins from city. Enjoy!"

Lets get the first hurdle out of the way, there is a steep hike up a hill involved and even though it is shaded and the hike trail is lined with hundreds of Buddhist idols along the way, you are going to get steamy and hot, especially in the summer, no matter how fit you are! Bring some water to both drink and pour on yourself! The walk isn't terribly long, but you'll feel it. There may also be mosquitoes, so bring some repellent. Having said that, don't be deterred. There is a very nice view from the top, the monastery is well kept and full of grand Buddhist images. You can take respite in the vegetarian restaurant that serve simple but surprisingly good food. From the first levels you can still go further higher for an even better view, you can visit the moseleum that is in these higher areas. Its interesting to see how most Hong Kongers are interned after death, there are not much space of cemeteries here! Just to respectful and have a look around.So if you are in the Shatin area, this is certainly worth a quick look if monasteries are your thing. The entrance to the park is very secretive, its behind the ICAC building BELOW the carpark. The area about the carpark leads to crematory area, you don't want to go there. Opposite the ICAC building is a shopping center that is a nice mall that sells household furniture and products that is worth a look too."

From Hong Kong central the trip will take about 30 minutes by train. Once you arrive at the gate you are greeted by a poorly had written sign and an alley with bamboo growing either side. A bit like you just walked through a broken chain link fence. But what you will find on the other side will blow you away. This was one of the greatest sights. Not for the feint hearted, or those out of condition, to get to the top you will have to climb 400 steps up a hill side, lined all the way with gold Buddha's. Truly fascinating. At the top after a cup of tea to refresh you, the sights and layout of this monastery are like no other. This is one memory I will have forever. Seriously there are more than 10000 Buddha's here, turtles in a pond, a happy Buddha in the hillside. Make sure you go right to the top. If you are going to Hong Kong plan this in. How to find it. Take the MTR to Sha Tin, this involves changing to an overground train for a few stops. Exit the station at exit B and walk down the ramp. Follow round to the left as the road curves. On your left are some original Chinese dwellings. \u263a At the next junction you will have a large office block in front of you. Turn left at this junction. And then first right. It will look like you are walking between two underground car parks. At the very end of the road (50 mtrs) is a turning circle for cars. In the left hand corner is the entrance."

We have been to Hong Kong a few times but had not made it out here before. It is well worth making the trip.Getting thereHead out to Sha Tin MTR station. About 45 mins from Central. It is a 10 minute walk from the MTR to the bottom of the steps. The station was extremely busy outside when we arrived. We turned left straight out of the station, curve around to the right, and follow the road past the bus stop below to the shopping centre. You have to walk behind the shopping square which is a very modern (mainly furniture and homewares including IKEA) and past the Sha Tin government offices. Locals will help with directions if you get lost. There are around 500 steps and it is at times step. A bit sweaty on a warm day.The walk upThe path is lined with gold Buddhas all the way to the top. The signs say don't touch or climb in the statues, don't. Some tourists we saw were being rather disrespectful and climbed up for photos, a security guy appeared form nowhere and was not happy. At the top of stage one is the temple which is very spectacular. Great views as well. No photos are permitted inside the buildings. You can then climb even further to buildings that appear to be mausoleums. Didn't ask what they were so not 100% sure. There are yet more Buddhas and finally some ponds and a white statue at the top. Exceptional views down the hill from here.Entry is free, opens at 9am. Shopping centre has reasonable coffee and cold drinks on the way back. Well worth the trip and a nice break from the hustle of the island and Kowloon."

The monastery is divided into upper and lower portions and occupied over 8 hectares. It consists five temples, four pavilions, one pagoda and one veranda. There are 12,800 pieces of exquisite Buddha statues each with different postures placed on the walls. At the opposite side of the main temple is the 9-storey Pagoda which was selected as the symbol of Hong Kong printed on the HK$100 banknote. One has to climb a number of steps to reach the monastery. People with high blood pressure,heart ailments and joint problems should think twice before visiting this place."

As the name suggests, it is a budhha temple with thousands of budhha idols. All idols in different poses. You have to get off at shatin MTR and from there, it is walking distance. There are a lot of stairs to climb. If you are not feeling fit or have trouble in climbing stairs, then think before you there. I was living near shatin so i visited this place 4-5 times. From the temple, view of new territories is very beautiful. One restaurant is also there where you can get some veggie food items.If you are in hongkong, and you have enough time, you can plan for this place. it is a sweet and nice place. If you running short of time, then you can skip this one. So it depends on the time you have."

No need to take taxi when you use the MTR. Just walk down straight along the bus terminal (follow pai tau street) then when you see a mall/big building cross the street and find this Sheung Wo Che Road. Go straight and you will see the ten thousand monastery signage. Allocate at least 2 hrs for this tour. The entrance is at the bottom where you will see different buddhas statues while climbing up. Sadly we didn't have enough time to reach the top due to our afternoon flight, at least 30min climb is needed and there are rest stops.

From Sha Tin MTR station Take exit B (Grand Central Plaza) and turn left. Follow the walkways down out of the station. Keep left, walking straight ahead. When you hit the first main intersection, cross the road and turn left. You will see the entrance to an Ikea-esque shopping centre on your right as you walk. Walk for a short time (no more than 1 minute) and then turn right down a narrow non-descript walkway right after a governmental-looking building. The Buddhas are at the end of this walkway. It's not that far from the station (10 minute walk max) and if you get lost just ask the locals."

You can either take the route through the Pai Tau Village, or go a bit further to a route behind the Hong Kong Government Office Building. The latter route is the main route to the temple.On this main route, you can see many golden statues of Lo Hon on either side of the path. Once up there, you can see the main temple, and on route further back up the hill a bit, there is a tall white statue of Kwan Ying that you'd not miss seeing. The main building and all the buddhas statues are worth seeing.On the way down hill, take the alternate route to the opposite side of the main route. There you can find many monkeys on the hill slope. Do not feed them though.We visited the temple many many years ago and these days, it has changed a lot. It becomes more of a tourist spot than monastary, with groups and groups of tourists taking photos here and there, yelling and even some of them enjoying their beer (which is supposed not to be) inside the compound. At the entrance of the main route, you can even find impersonated monks asking for money!"

All the way up, there are large gold painted Buddha's on both sides of the path. Whilst this is impressive, keep walking for a more impressive sight.Once at the main temple, there are 13,000 small Buddha's lining the walls which are all different. Well worth the climb.

I suggest visiting this first as it it is interesting, and you probably won't want to climb again after the 10,000 Buddhas. The steps to the 10,000 Buddhas are at the end of Sheung Wo Che Road, look for the gilded life-size statues on the way. Be aware of false monks begging near the entrance. The monastery is relatively new (completed in 1957) with several impressive shrines (the founder's body is in the main one). You can climb the 9 storey pagoda, and there is a nice small vegetarian restaurant and clean toilets. It is worth visiting Pai Tau village on the way back to the MTR, though there was a lot of construction nearby in early Jan 2015. Continue through the station to exit A, cross the river and follow the walk to Tsang Tai Uk aka Shan Ha Wai, a well preserved Hakka walled village. You can enter the inner walls and the ancestral hall (rest is private). It is hard to find this village, try marking on Google maps. It s also close to Che Kung Temple MTR, reached from Sha Tin MTR or the riverside walk. The temple looks interesting, but I didn't visit. You can hire bikes along the riverside walk, and there are lots of food opportunities in the large shopping centres beside the MTR station."

Located a stone throw away from IKEA at Sha Tin, the place is an epitome of tranquility, a welcome relief from a bustling city. Be prepared to walk up a medium incline (431 steps). If you're visiting with kids (3 years & upwards), don't worry about it - they can cope (atleast mine did). Once at the top, the monastery itself is beautiful & offered excellent views of Sha Tin township below. The prayer hall, where you will find ten thousand Buddha statues, is fantastic. Do pay attention to the rules around no food and photography inside the main prayer hall. Key things: Total trip time (ex Sha Tin MTR) is about 2 hours. Don't bring food as there is no place you can sit to eat. There is a vegetarian restaurant at the monastery, but we ate at the New Plaza, which houses IKEA. Bring lots of water to keep yourself hydrated (especially in the summers). Don't forget your camera :)"

The steps are reasonably steep with Buddhas on the way up on each step. This panicked me somewhat as I did not fancy 5 or 10,000 steps. Luckily there are not that many - most of the Buddhas are in the actual temple at the top. You get a great view from the temple and the pagoda and there is also a nice fishpond a bit further up. Hardly any one there so it was quite peaceful. And there also is a little vegetarian restaurant at the top. And a toilet in case you think you might Sha Tin your pants (my kid's joke of the day....)."

It was a little complex to get there but the directions in other reviews here are very good and so we found it with no problems. The climb is a bit of a challenge but it was cool (drizzling actually) so we didn't mind. The whole place is quite extraordinary to see! The thousands of gold fibreglass Buddhas lining the walkway all seem to be different. We were amazed to see the caretaker riding up and down the steep path on a strange little vehicle with tractor tracks - presumably the vehicle used to take the Buddhas up to the temple for refurbishment when required. Watch out for the monkeys too... We heard monkey chatter (more like 'yelling') in the bamboo behind us and turned to see two large monkeys leap out of the bamboo, onto the Buddhas heads and across the path - one chasing the other... If anyone had been standing there they could have been hurt!On reaching the temple, we were treated to a gorgeous display of colourful deities and beautiful views. The whole area was so serene and gorgeous - we loved it. A kind Chinese lady told us to go up to the next section which we were grateful about. It was only another few minutes climb but we may have missed it had she not told us. In the top area there wee more temple buildings and a fantastic grotto with even more gold Buddhas, waterfalls and a huge white, stone(?) Buddha... A beautiful sight and certainly well worth the effort!"

If you're like me and my friend who doesn't just want to visit the common tourist spots when traveling, you should try visiting this place. It is quite tricky to find the entrance, but all you have to do is alight at Sha Tin MTR station, and take exit B. Walk along the ramp beside the bus terminus until you reach street level. Continue walking past the Pai Tau Village on your left opposite Grand Central Plaza mall on your right. Turn right on Sheung Wo Che Road (the first street past the mall) and walk along government offices and car-parks until you reach the end of the street with a yellow sign that would direct you to the staircase leading to the monastery.The entrance to the monastery is free of charge. The trek up is quite an exercise but is tolerable. Alongside the path are different buddha statues, and at strategic points are seats where you can rest before continuing the long trek up. After reaching the top, one can sit down, relax and reflect quietly. You can also enjoy the view of the New Territories. There are lots of newly built attractions within the temple which are quite picturesque for selfies/groufies. While enjoying the serenity of the place, make sure to be quiet and not destroy it.The monastery with the 10K buddhas is quite a sight, too."

Then change to the light blue line at Kowloon Tong to get to Sha Tin. With Hong Kong's MTR system being one of my favourites (it's super easy to use), it's probably the best way to get to the monastery.To head to the monastery from the MTR, use \"exit B: Pai Tau Street, Pai Tau Village, public transport interchange\". Once you exit, turn left and walk down the footbridge. A lot of people will be walking down this bridge. On the left you'll see a row of old houses named \"Pai Tau Village\". Once you get past this row of houses, at the end should be a playground area and on the right are what looks like government buildings. Look for the street Sheung Wo Che Rd and walk to the end of this street. The building on the left is ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption) and at the end of the street is the entrance to the monastery. ==> have a look at my photos for an idea of what the area looks like. = PRICING = Other than the cost of catching MTR and spending money on food etc at the New Town shopping mall (located at Sha Tin MTR) or at the monastery's vegetarian restaurant, there's no entrance fee to the monastery, however once you get to the top at the praying halls, there are donation boxes.= DURATION = You could easily set aside a day for the monastery and the New Town shopping mall. For us, we arrived at the shopping mall and had breakfast at Fairwood (a fast food chain serving quite yummy food) before setting off to the monastery. By lunch time, you should be done at the monastery so you can come back to the shopping mall to cool down, have lunch and do some shopping.= TIP =Try to go on a cool, cloudy day because it's a lot of walking up the slanted walkways to the praying halls. If you end up going on a sweltering hot day like we did, make sure you bring plenty of water, maybe a handheld fan, a hat and wear comfortable walking shoes and clothing.As it is a place of worship, there are signs at the praying halls area stating 'no photography'. And as such, it would be wise to respect this and also to keep the noise levels at a minimum.There is a vegetarian restaurant at the praying halls which you can dine at, or like we did, you could finish your visit and head back to New Town shopping mall to have lunch."

It is a small walk 10-15 min from the MTR station to the base of the monastery. Once there, you need to climb over 400 stairs to reach the top which has the monastery. The climb is not steep. On your way you will see statues of Buddha in different avatars. They are all lined up up to the top and are beautiful. There is a main Buddhist temple at the top and a few smaller places of worship as well. There is also a pagoda to climb. There is a vegetarian restaurant that serves Chinese/Cantonese vegetarian food."

The entrance is close to Sha Tin MTR, tucked away behind a government building but once you are on the steep path up to the monastery you are surrounded by statues of Buddhas all the way to the top (not a trek for those not having a reasonable fitness level), where there are many magnificent statues and other things to see.The main hall is covered with small buddhas on all the walls (there really are more than 10,000) and there's a tower with a spiral staircase which you can climb up for some great views.It's a working monastery with people worshipping and paying respects to dead relatives so you need to be quiet and respectful, obeying the signs.We had some lunch at the vegetarian restaurant. Maybe we just chose the wrong dish but it was pretty awful.I would very much recommend this as a half day away from the frantic pace of the Hong Kong metropolis."

I had herd a lot about this Monastery, how ever no words could actually paint an accurate picture of this lovely, peacefully place up on a hill near the village of Sha Tin. Arriving by train is probably the best method of getting to Sha Tin from Hong Kong, I used the MTR smartphone app successfully to find my way there. On the way to the Monastery there is quite a bit to take in and capture with holiday snaps. Probably the most recognisable shop you will notice is IKEA, maybe because of their blue and yellow sign. Also on the way you will see many small stalls and shops selling offerings for the dead, paper clothes and other such items that are burnt to send them into the afterlife to loved ones who have passed away. Man Fat Sze is locate at the top of a near by hill and the path to walk up is situated behind the mall where IKEA is located. Be aware that this is a sloping up hill walk and even though there are a few rest point along the way it is still a good workout and should be taken slowly. You will pass many life sized golden coloured statues of Buddha's each different from the previous ones. I would also recommend wearing very comfortable and appropriate foot wear. As I have pointed out many times a bottle of waster should be taken as well and sipped to keep from dehydrating and spoiling a good days outing. Most importantly take the journey slow,pace yourself and stop occasionally to rest.At the top, well where the temples are, you will see signs asking that no photos be taken inside the temples, for the respect of the Buddhist please follow this request as there is a lot that they do allow you to take photos. Another thing I should point out is that there have been cases of \"fake\" monks begging for money and there are signs along the walk warning of this. Real Buddhist monks Do Not beg so please do not encourage this activity by giving these beggers in monastic clothing money. Actually when I visited I did not see any but do be aware they are around from time to time.The monastery it's self is rather simple compared to others you can visit but that does not in anyway distract from it's beauty or serenity. In the largest of the temples you can collect a brochure that explains about the founder of the monastery and his actual mortal remains are still located infront of the three large Buddha statues in this temple surrounded by hundred or possible over a thousand small Buddha statues. The complex contains about five temples and a pagoda along with a vegetarian cafe that serves excellent meals or just pick up a cold drink. Man Fat Sze, the Ten Thousand Buddha's Monastery is well worth a visit and makes for an excellent half or near full days outing. The walk continues above the temples up past many other Buddha statues and as ai have mentioned it is well worth the work out just take it slow and pace yourself."

On the way up, thousands of buddhas will greet you with each one distinct from the other. At the Monastery on first level, there is a restaurant where you can buy food and drinks.*) There are two levels to this place, you know you are at the top level where you see the white buddha, Buddha status against the waterfall and tortoise/turtle lazing in the pond. Make sure you go till the top, the views are amazing from there.*) Entrance is free.*) With over 12,000 Buddhas both outside and inside the temple. Along each side of the path, there are life-sized sitting or standing buddha figures, each having a different facial expression. *) Bring your own water and shade, no drinking water fountain anywhere.*) Toilets available on the first level, did not see any on the second level.*) No pictures allowed in the proper temple/prayer hall, rest everywhere you are allowed to take pictures.*) Very few tourists/locals here, and we went on Saturday.For a detailed trip list feel free to visit http://hongkongandmacauitinerary.blogspot.in/2014/10/hong-kong-macau-itinerary.html"

Although the climb is challenging in the heat, most of the way is in the shade (I went around 1pm) so it wasn't too bad. Sadly I didn't see any monkeys but the buddhas gave plenty to marvel at. Getting up to the main temple was easy enough, even with taking it slowly and taking tons of photos along the way, it must've taken about 20 minutes tops. What a beautiful sight when you do reach the top; just stunning. I spent roughly two hours just taking it all in - be sure to go the few extra steps to get to the terrapin pool and get the most magnificent view of the valley below. I didn't mind the slight building work going on at all, it actually gave an interesting contrast to the temple areas. The loos were fine - some of the doors were hanging off but all in all, clean enough and there was soap!

It seemed super authentic and no one spoke much english (if at all) but we got by from pointing. Great views of the city from the top too - worth the trip!"

At first we were a little frustrated because we got lost coming out of Sha Tin Station (and wound up on the wrong side of the divided highway). REAL WAY TO GET THERE: Find the exit that takes you towards the Government Offices. As you exit, you should see a bus depot on your right. Keep following the signs for the Government Offices. The entrance to the monastery is between the Offices and the Ikea.It is a long climb up, especially in the August heat. There is almost no air conditioning at the monastery, so be sure to dress for the weather. There are no apparel rules for visiting like long pants.What really made the trip cool was the fact that the top pavilion has a small pond with turtles and fish, and when we were descending, the monkeys were out in full force. They were really awesome, but one of the male alphas did make menacing moves at the boyfriend, so don't get too close! There was also a small kid going up at that point and he looked pretty terrified of the monkeys.Bathrooms were the ordinary squat variety, but very clean. (Anytime there's soap in a bathroom in Asia, I call that a win!)"

Some are serious, some whimsical, some playing instruments - all are wonderful and each is different. Take your time and really look at their expressions - they're lovely and fun. The Temple itself is beautiful and, from what I understand, it actually has about 13,000 buddhas. There are additional temples, terraces, and a pagoda.

At Shatin MTR take exit B, turn left, walk down the ramp alongside the bus terminus (just follow the crowd), down to street level, past Pai Tau Village on the left. keep walking to the junction with Pai Tau Street on the left (you will see a shopping plaza with Homesquare and IKEA store). Follow Pai Tau Street and take the first street on the right, Sheung Wo Che Road and follow this street alongside Shatin Government Offices and a multi-storey car parkAt the end of Sheung Wo Che Road is a yellow direction sign for the monastery. After a short walk on the path you will come to the start of the steps. The walk from the MTR station to the start of the path leading up to the monastery takes about ten minutes. Enjoy the climb if you can. There is a Buddha statue on the side of every step. All are different. There are benches to rest on if you get tired, but really it is not that strenuous as likely you will take your time walking and taking photos on the way.Warning: do not give money to the people dressed as monks. They are not real monks. Real Buddhist monks do not ask for money. Actually there are no resident monks at this monastery, it is managed by laypersons.At the top of the steps you come to the main attractions, Wander around and take it all in. There is a large hall with very impressive decorations and many thousands of small Buddha statues. There are other smaller pavilions to visit too. There is also a pagoda.It is worth to climb the steps up the 8 levels inside the pagoda.On this level there is a vegetarian restaurant. English is not well spoken by the staff but it is still worth having a bite to eat there. And have a refreshing drink.Note: on this level there is another entrance/exit at the other end to the main entrance. There are not as many steps to walk. It leads to a small village (and small bee-hive where you can buy honey) and eventually comes out quite close to the Shatin MTR station.Also, there is an upper level to walk to, take the path near the main entrance. It is not as strenuous a walk as the first lot of steps. It is worth walking up to the next level. You get some very good views over Shatin and there are other smaller halls and pavilions to visit. You will even see a small waterfall with small turtles and some goldfish in a small pond.Overall you can allow 2-3 hours for the walk there and back and looking around the monastery."

Turn right before your reach the last building on your right and continue straight to the walkway that leads uphill. It can be a little tricky finding the little sign that leads you to the walkway. It's a small area, so you can't get too lost. It's a steep climb. We had our two kids with us, so we took several breaks. There are a few benches along the way to sit on and catch your breath. Walking up the hill, you will see 1000 different tiny gold buddhas on each side of the walkway. It helps keep the climb interesting. Once you make it to the top, there is a pagoda, a pavilion and the main temple among other sights. No pictures are allowed in the main temple. There is a little cafe at the top, but the menu is limited. The customer service in the little cafe is just ok.

There are two entrances, make sure to take one up and take another down so you will see all the buddha status."

Easy to find exit MRT at Sha Tin take exit B go down the ramp and follow signs to Govt building, pass the GB and walk 100m to a white ancestral hall on the right take the path just before the white building. There are no signs directing you to this temple for some reason. TBH I thought it looked tacky a bit like Las Vegas on a budget. It's very Chinese and there are lots of Buddhas the best bit is the hall with all the miniature Buddhas. If your not fit don't even try this I'm an ex fitness instructor n in the heat the climb half killed me. No access for the disabled due to location. It's free n if your in the area why not go see. There's a vegetarian cafe there too. It is in a very safe area look out for monkeys."

These statues come in a range of poses, all are golden but some have hair, some seem lost in thought whilst others are pulling funny faces. We walked up here when it was around 35'c and 80% humidity so arrived drenched. However, we didn't feel the walk up was exerting but have recently trekked in Nepal.Once at the temple you can see many more miniature Buddhas along with some other interesting statues. There are also views over this area of Hong Kong. The monastery also sits under the flight path should you be interested in some plane spotting.Another path winds its way to another temple, along with part of a hill covered in more statues. There are drinks and food served here along with clean toilets. It is a bit out of the way but it is free and something different. However, there is no history about the monastery or any of the temples, which is a shame as it is a rather unique and interesting place. I would have likes to have been able to find out more."

DIRECTIONS:- Make your way to Sha Tin MTR Station- Take Exit B- Turn left from MTR station going down the ramp- Walk towards the giant mall, take the first left (you should be in between the mall on the right and a playground/recreational area on the left)- Head towards Sha Tin Government Offices (if you have your GoogleMaps with you, you should be able to locate this)- Foot path to the monastery is exactly behind the Sha Tin Government Offices (if you get lost, just circle the building and you'll eventually find the entrance and some signs leading to the entrance)Despite reading several reviews on finding the temple, I managed to get lost! However, once I found the entrance (along with 2 other lost travelers!) the walk up the hill was pleasant. Got drenched in the rain as well, but sought refuge in the restaurant at the top of the hill. After a nice hot meal and several cups of hot tea, exploring the temples and plaza was quite rewarding. Make sure you go all the way up to the top where you will be rewarded with a stunning view and a beautiful Buddha statue against the waterfall background. I only stayed for around an hour as the temple closes at 5pm, but would have loved to stay for longer to really appreciate the temples! Would suggest the temple maintenance crew to make better signs though! The ones on the main road were a bit faded and I went all the way up to the top of the cemetery next door only to get strange looks from the families praying to their ancestors! Best part of this though, was it was FREE! :-)"

Little incense pots and candles were every where. No one looked at us like we were intruding, so we looked around a bit and then headed back to the stairs. The entrance to Ten Thousand Buddhas was not clearly marked, and we had not seen any signs, but we followed a few others along a path that got us there. Ten Thousand Buddhas was built over a period of time by a man who wanted to honor the Buddha. Along each side of the path, there are life-sized sitting or standing buddha figures, each having a different facial expression. We had a fun time guessing what each buddha would be saying, some of the facial expressions were very funny! It was a typically hot and humid Hong Kong afternoon in April, so we were relieved to see a sitting area half way up. Take your time and keep climbing, you'll be happy you did.

Google sent us in the wrong direction on day one, and there's a temple in front - so make sure you take the path to the right of the big temple to find it. We also were accosted by a fake monk - there are signs warning you not to donate and stating it is a FREE attraction so do not be fooled. It is a bit of a walk up quite a few stairs but definitely worth it. The Buddhas are all unique - not one is a repeat and it's a calm, peaceful getaway from the busy streets of Central and Kowloon.If you put the Trip Advisor address into google, it will send you to Sha Tin Pass Rd, which is WRONG - make sure you search for Tai Po Road, Sha Tin - this is a completely different area! The East Rail Line on the MTR will take you to Sha Tin and it's easy to find from there."

It's not that far from the city centre and it's well worth a visit. Walking up the steps through a sea of gold buddhas, each one unique in its own way and with different facial expressions, is a really great experience. It's really quiet and peaceful there with very, very few tourists around. Once you get to the top the temple and pagoda are also really worth walking around. We took some fantastic photos and had a lovely peaceful, chilled time up there. It feels like it is right in the mountains. It's definitely one of the more unique experiences we had in Hong Kong. I would go back again if I was visiting the city.From the Sha Tin subway station, walk left when you exit, keep walking down the incline from the station, passing some small shops and houses on your left, and the bus station on your right. When you see the Ikea store in front of you, cross over to it and then turn left. Walk for about a minute until you see the Sha Tin Government Office Building, cross over the street to the building and the turn right and walk straight, you will see a green mesh fence ahead of you and think it is a dead end. But walk straight up to the fence and once you are close you will see the opening and the big sign for the monastery. The walk uphill is not that long and you forget about all the steps because the Buddha statues are so interesting."

It is about 5 minute walk from Sha Tin station and quite easy to find by following the signs. You probably want to set aside at least 1-2 hours visiting time, not including travel. It is a pretty huge walk up the hill (430 steps) to many different split levels of the monastery past many of the 10,000 Buddha statues that are all very beautiful and different. A lot of the area prohibits photos but as you reach higher up there are some great photo spots. I visited when it was raining on and off and found it to be quiet with very few visitors. It was a beautiful, colourful place with a really relaxing and positive energy. A word of advice, there are 'monks' who linger at the gates and try to sell you things, shoving bracelets onto your wrists. Be assertive and say no... they are con artists!!! Real monks would never try to sell you anything!"

My friend, who is decidedly the more safety conscious of the two of us was very concerned about the direction we were travelling. Admittedly, we seemed to be going through a neighbourhood which looked to be off the tourist path and every sign post warned us of theft in the area which did nothing to ease the concerns of my travelling companion. After some time we came upon some steep steps up. Towards the top we heard rustling in the trees and after a while we determined that there was a group of monkeys that were playing in the trees which was a lovely thing to watch. Towards the top golden statues started to line the path. The grounds were amazing. There is a vegetarian restaurant available if you happened to be a little peckish after the walk. Views are amazing (I didn't realize how high we had climbed). From what I could discern the place makes it's money from cremations. There are a number of places/buildings in which your ashes could be placed. Beautiful golden cubicles, where the deceased's photos and words of departure are etched. Yes it is a walk and it can be challenging if you do not love getting hot and bothered with walking up and down multitudes of stairs. However, I am happy I took the time to visit this beautiful place. Unique and spiritual. To me it was a glimpse into the path to the afterlife for the local people. I thoroughly recommend the visit."

We had lunch there, delicious vegetarian food. Be sure to be respectful and wait until the offering of food to the Buddha has been made first. We wandered out of the main courtyard and saw some interesting deserted dwellings and beautiful life-size, colourful statues of goddesses (sorry, I don't know much about Buddhism). Bonus - you don't have to go back down the way you came up - you get to go down another path lined with even more life-sized statues.

From the base, there's a fairly steep climb...but stopping off to catch your breath every 20 steps or so, would help. Once you make it to the top, the temple is beautiful with several (in excess of 10, 000 I'd say) small buddha stauettes surrounding the three main idols. A beautiful, serene, peacful prayer atmosphere - as in any Buddhist shrine. Gigantig Incence sticks burn outside pervading their fragrance. Also, other stauettes of the buddha in his other forms, one riding a lion, the other, a blue elephant, and a third, with thousands of hands radiating out, blessing all those who seek His grace. Also, a large 'tower of lights' in the courtyard. After the climb down, head for the Ikea showroom (which you pass, on the way up) for some voyeuristic hedonism, also the Ikea Cafe on the 5th floor. Great Swedish meat balls, and some other snacks and bevarages. Like most of Hong Kong, you have to queue up...but very efficiently managed. Seating although about 60-odd, is also in short-supply at times."

I went there on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year.I saw quite a number of locals, some are aged and I am impressed by their determination of climbing up the hill with hands holding incense and others. The path up was nice, with Buddhas on both side of the path, each Buddha is unique in expression. There are resting areas at intervals for those who need some rest. It seems that those resting are not local, those devotee climbed out non-stop.The setting is nice, not a big place but quite unique. I have not seen a similar one elsewhere!Inside the main hall are thousand of small Buddhas that covered all the walls. Perhaps that is how they got the name. I have been to HK for more than 10X, and 1X to this Monastery. I am glad I made an afford to visit it. It was well worth it. BTW, there is a small little village beside Sa Tin MTR station.

Viewing videos and google maps, I found the route running alongside the Po Fook Hill Ancestral Hall to be more of an opened and pleasing trek (rather than walking in between some tall, rusty-old fences - if you had made a right along Shatin Gov't Offices).Here's what we did to get there:1) From Exit B, make a left as you leave the station and keep walking down to the end (note: there is big bus terminus outside, it should remain on your right as you walk away from it).2) At the end, there is a pedestrian ramp, walk all the way down the ramp to street level (note: the old Pai Tau Village can be seen on your left as you walk down the ramp).3) At the end of the ramp, you should see a sign for Shatin Gov't Office. Continue walking the path straight to the end of the street (note: you should see green minibuses down on your right).4) At the end of the street, cross the street so you are on the side of the mall / IKEA (note: be careful crossing the street, there was no traffic light)!5) After crossing the street at the corner, make a left and continue walking along Pai Tau Street. The first street you will see on your right is Sheung Wo Che Road (which runs along Shatin Gov't Office). You will see signs for the monastery. Don't turn in here, keep walking straight..6) Turn right on the NEXT street (which is pretty much the end of the block, where you should see a white-looking arch building - this is the Po Fook Hill Ancestral Hall).7) There is a yellow sign on the ground pointing to the monastery, walk up along the side ramp and you'll be at the entryway in about a minute or so / no time flat! Tips / Notes:1) You will immediately see monks when you reach the entryway. Brush them off / Ignore them / Don't look at them. If you did your research, you will know these are not real monks!!!2) I did not take the advice of previous reviewer and did not bring bug spray. I was the only one who ended up getting bit 4 times on my arm (luckily, it was not itchy, just a little). I should have bought bug spray, there are still some bugs in December...! So take heed!3) Do bring water, good advice mentioned by previous posters. It helped!4) Don't worry, there are benches for sitting at each sections of the path. Rightly situated, not too far apart. No problems with finding a seat as there were not many people there at the time (about 12:30pm).5) Be careful with the handrails, there are some ants that do crawl along the railing!6) You can walk up the 9-story pagoda (at the lower level terrace). If your legs can handle more stairs, give it a walk!It was well-worth a visit, a slight off-the-beaten path excursion!"

At first i simple-mindedly thought that they are just collecting the donations and opened my wallet, and took out HKD 20 note, this was my serious mistake as the monk saw more money inside and started to ask for HKD 100! I immediately put off the bracelet and told him that he can keep HK20 i already passed him, but i don't need the souvenirs. He got back but very reluctantly with disappointed look on his face and it felt he would rather rob me if he could. I proceeded upstairs to monastery thinking of this strange behaviour not in accordance with spiritual rank, and immediately saw a sign on the fence saying that you should beware of fake monks, that monks do not just hang round asking for money etc. On my way back i saw them again, they stood a bit aside from trail entrance, tall, muscled, and all three of them were unfriendly staring at me. They were accompanied by another \"monk-clothed\" accomplice atop a gangster-style motorbike. I don't know why authorities tolerate conmen acting right in front of district office, probably because proper bribe \"rent\" was paid, but please do not repeat my mistake, do no take out the wallet, if the \"monks\" insistently block your way, call the police or pretend you want to.

The walk up is lined with many gold coloured life-sized Buddha's on both sides and one can just take you time and enjoy the hike up. The climb is relatively easy with small steps and benches at intervals for resting. We did not count the number of buddhas but they definitely all appeared uniquely posed.It might take more than 20 mins to reach the top, over the 500-metre path, where one will see a breathtaking view of the surrounding Sha Tin..... scenic with lots of trees and mountains/hills surrounding the Monastery. There is also a small vegetarian restaurant and a towering 9-story pagoda here (appearing on the HK$100 note). The ambiance is one of tranquility and peacefulness.The temple dates from the 1950s and was founded by Rev Yuet Kai, a devout Buddhist layman who dedicated the last years of his life to constructing the elaborate temple. His preserved body is still presented in the main hall of the monastery in a glass case as the main attraction of the temple.We like the place as it is much less touristy than many other tourists\u2019 attractions. Admission is free but donations are welcome. A little tip; preferably to go during the cooler months so that your hike up will be more comforting.

I travel for work, so I had to really find some time to get to this destination because all together it will probably take about 2 hours. Getting there after you leave the train station is a bit tricky, but I found some directions online and followed them closely and was able to find it in about 10 minutes. I was there in 90F weather, so the walk up the steps was intense but awesome, the many Buddhas and other little things you see along the way are amazing and then the peak? All the work feels like it paid off greatly - great views, amazing temple. ONLY do it if you can walk a good amount and climb many steps though, not good for elderly or disabled. I guess it's becoming a little more known, hopefully that doesn't ruin it. When I was there about 2 years ago I saw only one other white person, unlike other tourist destinations that were full of foreigners - not a bad thing, but hopefully it retains some it's mystique."

There are some good directions from some other posts on how to reach it. I enjoyed that it was not touristy at all, and was a nice moderate hike up to the top. Once to the monastery it was truly impressive how there are over ten thousand miniature buddhas, each with its own unique pose. A truly beautiful place I would highly suggest visiting. The vegetarian food there was excellent, a million times better than the food served at the big buddha."

We went on a Saturday morning and there weren\u2019t any crowds.I loved the statues and the colorful, ornately painted buildings. Try to go on a clear day. The golden Buddha statues seemed to come alive in the sunlight. It was a photographer\u2019s paradise. If I ever return to Hong Kong, Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery would be the first place I\u2019d revisit.We didn\u2019t see any monkeys! Maybe they sleep late on Saturdays?Two tips: 1) Water. 2) Insect repellant. Bring a bottle of water to drink on the walk up to the Monastery. And if you are prone to insect bites, bring insect repellant. I brought repellant for this trip, but forgot it at my hotel. I got 6 or 7 bites, mostly on my legs. It was a sunny, warm day in November and I was wearing shorts."

There are two entrances/exits. We entered at the entrance to the right which was about a 5-10 minute walk and exited at the entrance/exit at the lower level exhibits. Entrance is free, however we did encounter monks selling little trinkets. Almost seemed a little iffy. We did not purchase any of the trinkets but did put some money in the bowl, it was the least we could do. As previous reviewers stated...be prepared to walk up a lot of steps. The many Buddha statues will help deflect the imagery of remaining steps to the top. Each Buddha is unique and shares its own story by way of expression, color and stance. Not a lot of monkeying around by visitors...just the real ones we encountered upon existing. All in all seeing the many Buddhas and the few monkeys created a fun visit!"

Having a good opinion of Buddhists, both of us made generous \"donations\".

As everyone who travels to Hong Kong knows, the MTR and transport system is first rate. Various route instructions tend to be a little confusing but generally if you find one that takes you from Shatin Station to the Government Building in Pai Tau Street you will be OK. but you need to turn right into the street infront of the Gov building and go to the end where you connect to the steep walk to the Monastery. The place has been around for some 60 years and the walk to the top is marked by many and varied Buddah statues some to shock and some to laugh at but all somewhat interesting. The climb is worthwhile for the views over Shatin, New Territories and adjacent hills. The main temple house some 13,000 buddah statues and must be considered as unbelieveable. There are other temples, pagodas and a verandah. The climb to the top is rewarded by a large ivory coloured Buddah and spectacular views. Earlier I mentioned the right hand turn in the directions - if one takes Pai Tau Street to the end and turns right after the Government Building, you are at Po Fook Hill Columbarium which is an awesome landmark which has potential for 100,000 niches. Cemeteries may not be your taste but this visit was a great find and again the views from the ascending stairs is spectacular. Interestingly enough the multi-level home products store houses a typical Ikea store complete with the expected cafeteria. I highly recomend further research of Shatin as there is much more to see and do."

From Sha Tin MTR station on the red line, it's not so clear where to go, particularly when its busy. I suggest you look on youtube for instructions - I'm unable to put a link in this review, sorry - you know you doing ok when you see the Ikea Building/Mall on the corner, turn left, then first right and head to the end of the street and up the hill. While some of the Buddhas might be a bit worse for wear, and do provide interesting studies and the number and variations are impressive. Bring water, as always. After a few stops and maybe half an hour you'll reach the monastery. Be considerate and mindful, its a monastery after all. You are not allowed to take photographs inside, but there's plenty of opportunities to take pictures outside. Make a donation or two. Warning, the toilets at the monastery are not the European type, just a hole in the floor. There is a small area for souvenirs purchasing inside. There's a nice view looking down to the city. A little fitness is helpful, and the walk climbs up most of the way. We found it a very tranquil and calming contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city. Younger children may find it not to their tastes."

We got the MTR to Sha Tin from Nathan Rd, Kowloon costing $9 each for 2 people and the ride was about 20mins. When you get off the train at Sha Tin exit at edit B and turn left towards the pedestrian slop and go down passing some traditional Chinese houses on the left. Go to the end of the road and you will see the bus station on the right, a playing court on the left and a Home Store Shopping Centre across the road in front of you. The road is Pai Tau St, cross over to the shopping centre and turn left making sure it's on your right hand side. The very next street you come to is Sheung Wo Che St, cross over and in front of you is a tall new looking government building, turn right and go down the street to the end (isn't far). On the right across the road is the entrance to the car park for the shopping centre. There is some mesh fence at the end with the sign for the 10,000 Buddha Monastery, go through and turn left and follow to the top. Note, there aren't any signs for the Monastery when leaving the train/bus station so the above directions will get you there. In all the walk to the start is about 5/10 mins. There are a few hundred steps and all the way up on both sides are full size gold Buddha statues all of which are unique. The walk can be tiring especially on a hot day but periodically there are benches to stop and relax if needed. There are monkeys in the trees and we saw a lot but they were bothered about our presence. There are both steps and a slope for prams/buggies/wheel chairs. At the top is the Monastery which is beautiful, there are restrooms but be warned no paper so bring your own if you think you might need to go and a restaurant. The view from the top is impressive and the Monastery itself is amazing with all the Buddhas inside. It won't take you all day but it's a nice couple of hours and well worth a visit."

After the close down of Hongkong Airport last September 23 and 24 due to the storm and the cancellation of our trip to Jiuzhaigou, China, I decided to be a tourist in Sha Tin, New Territory in Hongkong. With three friends, we went to the Sha Tin MTR Station and started the uphill climb to the 10,000 Buddhas Monastery located more than 400 steps to the top of the hill. Beware at the entrance, there were 2 fake monks who stopped us and made some blessings on our forehead. Then, they slipped one bracelet made of plastic jade or red and brown beads on our wrists. Afterwards, the fake monks asked for HK$100.00. We yanked out the bracelets and told them we didn't have a lot of money. When we got to the entrance of the monastery we read the sign. \"BEWARE OF FAKE MONKS! THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR BEGGARS\". We then started our ascent and after the zigzagged stairs, we came to a landing and rested. We saw four monkeys, along the path and they seemed to be quite at home despite the tourists going up and down. The climb is easy with the small steps and the path is lined with many life size buddhas. If one looks intently, they look like common Chinese citizens in different positions. Once we reached the top though all the statues look like Buddha...Quan Ying and more buddhas in different poses. The ambiance of the entire place is so holy, tranquil and peaceful for the soul. On the rails of the grounds, one will see a breathtaking view of Sha Tin..... so scenic with lots of trees, mountains and hills surrounding the Monastery. Tired from the climb we had a vegetarian lunch in the small restaurant. Another amazing feature of the monastery aside from the 10,000 buddhas are the hundreds of bonsai trees lining the Buddha statues. From their appearance the bonsai trees count tens to probably hundred years. No wonder this monastery is an attraction for the travelers from outside and within Hongkong."

It is right next to the \"Po Fook Ancestral Worship Hall\", which has an impressive and decorative entrance gate, several temples and lots of steps built into the side of the hill. After climbing lots of steps and not seeing what we were expecting, we figured out we were at the wrong place. The sign for the 10,000 Buddhas Monastery was laying on the ground pointing towards what looks like a back alley where people walk their dogs (and let them take care of business). Our first encounter was 3 Buddhist monks who were blocking the entrance, approached us and stuck cheap little \"bracelets\" on our wrists while shaking our hands. They then proceeded to perform some sort of ritual, touching our foreheads with their beads and mumbling something. We're more than a little \"weirded out\" by this since we aren't Buddhist and aren't interested in whatever it is they're doing. THEN, they pointed to a $100 bill (about $13 USD) letting us know they wanted us to pay for the strings they put around our wrists. Not wanting to create a scene, I went ahead and gave them the $100 and went to move on. Then I found out they wanted us to pay $100 PER PERSON (and there were 5 of us). When I refused, they became very agitated, but not as agitated as they were when I tried to remove the bracelet and give it back to them. I ended up giving them $200 ($26 USD)in total to get out of there, but what a shakedown!!! I don't hang around Buddhist monasteries much, so maybe I should have known better, but we didn't ask for anything from them and for \"peaceful\" monks, they were certainly aggressive. So if you go and see several monks hanging around the entrance, watch out and avoid them. Don't let them shake your hand and don't let them put any of their garbage on your wrist unless you have some cash to burn..."

You get the feeling like dozens of eyes are looking at you and you only. But, otherwise, it's a very nice place. Not packed with tourists like other places in HK are. You could relax a bit from the tense city by looking over Shatin from a high view. When you reach the end of the stairway, you would see the Man Fat Temple. Walk around the place to see more of the bigger statues. Then continue to climb up. There are a lot more to see. At the highest point, there's a big Guan Yin statue and I think its the best statue in there."

There are signs in various languages asking visitors to respect the religious significance of the site, not bring picnics, keep their voices down, etc. Sad that they have to remind people to do this. So if you're the kind of mass tourist who can't be respectful, don't come here. Otherwise, it's well worth the visit."

The road to the temple is through quite a few steps, the steepness was not bad. Along the way we got to handle a heavy tropical rain shower, fortunately we did have embrellas en there were shelters. The road up was surrounded by large Buddha statues. It is a very exuberant temple. In the temple there are three big walls with thousands of different Buddha statues, very beautiful and impressive. The images in the outbuildings are also very colorful and fanciful. Delicious dinner at the eating house. Just before we would go back there were a number of monkeys on the grounds, the monkeys were chased away by the administrator. Then we descended the hill via a different route.

We went in to the shopping mall to get a map and directions. From there you have to cross the street and walk up a hill on a bit of a sketchy looking path. The hike up is about 15 minutes. My friends complained the whole way, but once you get to the top it's worth it. There's so many statues along the way up - each unique looking. The temple inside is full of tiny Buddhas all over the walls. The whole complex is very beautiful and a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. We were pretty much the only ones there, so it was nice to escape the crowds. You can climb up the tower, but it's not really worth it since there's no windows at the top to see the view.

On the way to the entrance at the bottom of the hill beware of fake monks (they exist at other temples in HK as well), they're harmless but they're not suppose to be there. On the way down, which is a different path, beware of a colony of rather aggressive monkies. They will grab your bags and rummage for food. Some people think its cute, but it's not and I've got chased up the hill by a monkey. These monkies are wild animals, they can be dangerous and there are no apex predators in the jungles of HK to keep the monkey population at bay.

I was drenched in sweat because of the high humidity but it sprinkles often enough that you got cooled off pretty easily. I highly recommend it though - it is not too congested with tourists like a lot of attractions in China were so you can actually get wonderful pictures.

In Hong Kong you will find many people dressed as monks and unsurprisingly at the 10,000 Buddha's temple you are guaranteed to encounter some. To determine whether you are dealing with a pretend monk or a real monk, apply the the monk money test. The test is quite simple, because a monk will never ask you for money. So If someone dressed as a monk asks you for a donation for any reason, including for a blessing they just gave you (most likely without asking you) then they are a monk imposter / scam artist. If they get aggressive in demanding payment, then walk off and ignore them, or if need be call the authorities; as you are on the correct side of the law, not them. The walk up to the temple is quite nice and the path is lined with Buddha's, it's up a short but fairly steep hill which is very slippery when wet. The temple itself is quite nice and there is a basic restaurant there, also a pond with a large number of turtles. To get there take exit B out of the the SHA TIN MTR station and take a left down into Pai Tau Street.

There are also monkeys that live on the hill side, do not feed or attempt to touch them as they are wild and I have seen tourist bitten by them.WARNING \u2013 Do not give money to the \u201cMonks\u201d at the bottom of the hill at the entrance, as they are not real, and just buggers dressed up, if you want to donate monies to the temple please do so at the top where there are donation tubs."

Watch out for the scary barking dogs on the route up to the temple that starts by heading through Pai Tau village out of Sha Tin station2. Watch out monkeys pooing on people from the trees above the path on the main route down from the temple3. Dont buy trinkets from the fake monks that stand just outside the temple grounds"

You follow the main road towards the Sha Tin Government Building (little blue signs) then when you get about 5-10 minutes along you come to an intersection with a large pitch on your left and Ikea across the street. Make a left and head to where a nice temple is locate with an arch and large white lions. Facing the temple you want to make a hard right (even further right than the parking lot) and follow a path between the parking lot fence and a big white building. It is paved. About 100 meters in you are at the entrance. Note: it is FREE admission but some swindling monks dressed up may try and ask for a donation. No need, they are not part of the temple. Make a donation at the top if you wish. The temple is awesome and well worth it. Another tip, after exploring head out of the temple and walk straight across the grounds taking in all thestatues. You will find an exit path that is also worth it. Less Buddhas but you should see a few monkeys. Enjoy!"

After seeing this sight, it was well worth the sweaty hot climb to the summit of the hill.  It's location is superb and as others have already mentioned, a very close walking distance to the Sha Tin MTR station. To get there, when you come up out of the MTR, look for Exit A (I believe), and follow the walkway to the left. Keep walking and you will then exit the MTR station. As you look up the ridge and to the mountains you may spot a tall white and maroon colored pagoda. The monastery is in this direction. Keep walking along the same sidewalk you used on the left hand side to get out of the MTR station. As you reach the end of the walkway you'll see a white colored arch with two guardian lions on either side. You are now nearing the location. Turn right when you reach this white arch and keep walking up the small hill PAST this entrance. Then, just look for the yellow with black writing sign that says Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery and then, you will begin your walk up the hill. If you're not entirely in shape for climbing (like myself), you may get very sweaty and need to take a few breaks on the way up. On your way though, there are Buddha statues on either side of the walkway. Once reaching the top, it's the main monastery that's well worth the challenging climb. Very well kept and well painted shrines, statues, and of course Buddhas lining the temple grounds. There is also a small eatery where you can buy food or drinks for those that may want a short rest and a bite to eat.  There are also some different levels you can climb to where other small shrines are located. There are also monkeys wandering about in one part of the temple so watch out. I saw one run along a fence and try to take a swipe at a couple who was unaware it was encroaching towards them.  Anyways in conclusion the trip to the top is worth it as the views are nice and the elements to see within the temple ground are quite cool. That and again, it's yet another destination that's very close to an MTR station much like many other sights in HK.  * Most notably, admission to this monastery is free of charge."

You are able to enter the temples, as long as you are respectfully quiet. On a clear day, it's a lovely view of HK, especially if you continue all the way up to where there is sometimes a waterfall and a beautifully white statue (though I wonder how long it will last white with all the HK pollution).

You can get inside the Pagoda and climb up to the top (good photo perspective from the top of the pagoda). There are many shrines inside the complex. In contrast with general atmosphere the main temple has spiritul atmosphere. There are miniatures of Buddha's statues from the floor to the top and they are lighted with soft light, there are almost 13 000 miniatures and each has a different pose.  You can climb more up and enjoy views over the the area of Sha tin and low level of monastery complex.Unfortunately, people working for this temple are rude and just replying that dont speak English. How to get there: Sha Tin Station, exit B, walk towards IKEA, then climb up following signs."

You can get there by taking the underground to the Sha Tin stop and then a short walk to where the pathway & stairs to the temple start. There are over 400 stairs to the top, but there are benches along the way if you need to rest. Gold Arhat statues line the path all the way to the top. Every single statue is unique. It really was a magical site looking up the path and seeing gold statues into the distance amongst the tree canopy. Once you got to the top of the stairs they open onto a courtyard temple complex with more Arhat statues as well as the main temple hall and pavillions, There is also a large pagoda at one end of the complex. A few more steps up and you reach the upper courtyards with more prayer halls & statues. From here there are some beautful views over the Sha Tin hills. The whole place is really peaceful and generally less touristy than other temple complexes in HK. It also has a buddhist run vegetarian cafe which is both good value and delicious."

However be sure to bring some water with yourself! Upon reaching the temples, all the different colorful statues of different gods are just amazing! There are multiple building to go into, and statues to see. There was a small souvenir shop, and a small restaurant as well next to the temple. I am very glad that I went there now, it just an amazing sight. A completely different sight of Hong Kong, I would say.

You can get there from Sha Tin Wai, but it's an unnecessarily long walk. From the station I just walked towards the hills and asked security at a shopping mall how to get to the monastery. The entrance is really unmarked and is between two hi-rise buildings, just behind the driveway. There is a little sign once you step off the pavement into the greenery. I do have a real GPS (not assisted GPS - no need for internet connection) with good maps on my phone, so I at least know general direction. Without that I think finding it can be a bit tricky.There a lot of steps and A LOT of Buddha statues, some are unassuming, some are amusing and some are quite bizarre. There are several monastery buildings on top and more statues. There is a little simple restaurant and a rest room. Very few tourists, a lot of space and it just doesn't seem like you're surrounded by a huge metropolis. Totally worth the trip if you're a bit more adventurous than regular tourist crowd and want to travel a bit more off the beaten path (although of course there's nothing wrong with going to all the regular touristy places as well)."

This attraction does not seem to be highlighted by the local tourist board possibly due to the incidence of landslips in the past and there is little indication of how to find the path up to the temple. However if you head to the IKEA store at the Home Square, stand facing out from the exit and turn right to pass in front of the Sha Tin Government offices you will see some signage that will lead you to some 460 steps up to the temple. However, if you cross the road in front of IKEA and walk towards the village and shops as far as a set of bollards the turn right, you will find a much easier way up. There are signs,including landslip warnings, but it is a much easier climb. You can return down the steep 460 steps at a comfortable pace.Not surprisingly there were only a few visitors and some of those appeared to spend little time there, perhaps disheartened by the signs requesting no photography in some areas. This is a religious site after all and the staff appeared very tolerant of those, who chose to take photos, provided a degree of respect was shown.The refreshment area is not at all sophisticated but the staff were very friendly and we enjoyed a big pot of tea and vegetable spring rolls for just HK$ 35.The buddhas are amazing though we wished there was some information in English regarding the many characters. We spent over an hour and a half taking in the atmosphere and the overall experience. This is a far better attraction than the well trampled site of the Big Budda. There is no Starbucks or Subway here and no plastic village; just peace, reverence and tranquility and a vivid contrast to the bright lights of bustling Hong Kong."

Man Fat Sze, also known as 10,000 Buddha Monastery (free entrance), is one of the more unique temple grounds in Hong Kong and one of our very favorite to visit. This is a place we continue to visit as residents in Hong Kong and a place that continually impresses our guests when they visit. It is well worth consideration for those eager to see some of Hong Kong's more interesting temple visits. Unfortunately, visiting Man Fat Sze requires a rather steep walk up Po Fook Hill, easily a 12-15 minute walk and this can be quite tiring, especially in the summer when its hot outside. However, the entire path is lined with hundreds of golden-colored, life size Buddha statues, each in different poses. Although few of the statues are that individually amazing, collectively they are quite neat to see. Of note, there are several stopping points with seats for those who require break from the long uphill break.Near the top of the path, you encounter the main temple building which is bright red in color. Inside, you will find walls covered with miniature Buddhas and a rather conventional Buddhist temple scene. Outside is a level ground with more life-size Buddha statues, a nice nine-story pagoda and other sacred statues and items that are well worth inspecting. Then you can walk up another a couple additional flights of hillside stairs, which are similarly lined with more Buddha statues. At the top, there are four of five more halls, similarly decorated with either miniature Buddha statues or other interestingly decorated figures. Several viewing spots are also found at these higher levels which afford some very nice views down into the city of Sha Tin. When viewing conditions are poor, which is quite common, these views are not so impressive. Otherwise, these can make a nice place to stop for a couple pictures. Once you've had enough time taking in the endless Buddha statues found throughout the complex, you can begin your descend back down the hill. This can be done by returning down the main path or the alternative path, found on the level area in front of the main temple hall, which leads you down through the village and eventually in front of the Sha Tin MTR station and New Town Plaza Shopping Mall.Overall, we really enjoy Man Fat Sze. While the temple buildings themselves are just ok, it is the presence of so many interesting Buddha statues that makes this a genuinely unique place to visit and one of our best temple experiences in Hong Kong. This is why we visit from time to time and why the 10,000 Buddha Monastery should be considered when you are thinking about what to do/see when visiting HK.Hint: During the summer, its highly advisable to visit Man Fat Sze early in the morning so you can get your climbing done before the heat really starts to set in for the day. The temple officially opens at 9am in the morning.Hint: To find the hill path leading up to Man Fat Sze, you need to walk behind the IKEA building ( Grand Central Plaza). As soon as you pass the IKEA building, turn right on Sheung Wo Che Road. This is a short turn off street which ends quickly and the path up the hill to Man Fat Sze begins there.Hint: A visit to Man Fat Sze takes a bit more time than most allow for. Keep in mind that usually takes between 20-30 minutes to arrive at the temple hall from the Sha Tin MTR because of the need to climb up the steep Po Fook Hill, the climb down is usually as long. If you spend no more than 30 minutes around the temple, you will still need approximately 90 minutes to visit this temple. This is how much time we try to allow for when visiting.Hint: A visit to Man Fat Sze actually fits quite nicely with several other attractions in this area. You can start with a visit to Man Fat Sze, take your lunch at the New Town Plaza Shopping Mall, stroll through Sha Tin Park to the very good Hong Kong Heritage Museum and then make a quick detour to the important Che Kung Temple, just across the river from the Heritage Museum. This is a nice little way to spend half a day in Sha Tin."

Nevertheless - it's still quite a sight inside.The 10,000 Buddhas are found down a small path and then up hundreds of stairs which are lined with gold buddhas - when you first see them it's pretty impressive, there's one either side on every step, but then as your breath starts to leave you, you kind of just want to get to the top!At the top is the actual temple which is impressive - one huge Buddha with thousands of little ones around it. There are more larger gold ones around too. There's a nice little cafe at the top serving fab food very cheaply. There's also soft drinks up there.

It's a long way up to the actual monastery. The path is lined with different buddhas that watch over the long, winding stairway. How far up is it? If you're in the bottom, you can't see the end of the trail - not until the 60th buddha! Our mistake was visiting the place in September at 12 noon in what felt like 100 degree weather. My sister made it to the final bend, but when she saw that the last few meters were the steepest, she waved the white flag and opted out. I made it all the way up and it was worth the climb. The place was fantastic. The buddhas ranged in size from tiny to gigantic and the atmosphere was solemn. In order to fully appreciate it, this place has to be witnessed first hand. A few tips: Avoid going going in the middle of summer, in the hottest time of the day without a bottle of water. This is an active monastery where people come to worship, be courteous and observe the rules: no food, no turning the place into the park, and speak quietly.Definitely pencil in this place when you take a trip to Hong Kong."

Definitely more impressive than Big Buddha. We decided to visit on the spur of the moment and it was one of our highlights of HK. The Monastery is situated half way up a very big hill, and there is actually ten thousand small buddha statues lined up from floor to ceiling on all four walls. Surprisingly enough this wasn't the most impressive thing there: the path leading up the hill from the street is lined all the way by hundreds of life sized golden statues of buddha and his followers, each of which is completely individual and some extremely weird! Once at the monastary there is a beautiful garden with pagoda and more statues, which then also lead on further up the hill to a large standing buddha. The monastery is free so if you pass any monks on the way asking for money don't pay out - they are fake monks who make a living from begging. It's not the easiest place to find: from Sha Tin MTR station turn left out of the exit, go down the ramp and bear left, take the second right and you will find the beginning of the path at the end of the street."

It's amazing how high up we are. There's also a path that leads further up the hill from the temple to a burial chamber for ashes, a beautiful fountain, more statues and another view of the city.NOTE: Do not get stopped by what appears to be a monk.

Right before it or (along the wall of this complex) is a path.

Along the path there are many Buddha statues but at the top is the best, with many statues and pagoda tower and a room full of thousands tiny Buddha statues. There is a restaurant (or shop that serves drinks at the top) and there are also bathrooms.One my way down from the monastery I ran into both a large wild snake slithering its way on the path before me, and then I saw a monkey down from a few branches, look at me, then climb over the wall onto my path to just stare at me. Neither harmed me, or looked harmful, but be careful with children, these animals are still wild."

Be warned, this monastery is on a hill and you need to be prepared to walk up quite a few steps to get there. We are not talking Great-Wall steepness here, the steps are fine for anyone of average fitness, but if someone is frail or has a dodgy knee, you might want to skip it.The route up can be a little tricky to find at first. The best way is to take exit B at the Sha Tin MTR into the bus station/podium, walk down the path on the far left hand side of the bus station which brings you down to street level. Follow the road curving to the left towards the Pei Tau Village/Grand Central Plaza (signposts for IKEA) and walk up Sheung Wo Che Rd which separates the shops from the Sha Tin Government offices. This road looks like a dead-end but up at the end on the LHS is the path up to the monastery. This path is lined with large buddha images, each one seemingly more bizarre. There are plenty of reasons to stop walking and snap pictures of them. When you get up to the main monastery, take a moment to pass by it, continuing up the hill for a short way and see the older, less public parts of the complex and the columbarium. The main complex has great views, recently refurbished and thus highly coloured statues, a pagoda and of course the main temple with the the '10000' (and who could tell) Buddhas. Lots and lots of photo moments to be found here. There is a small vegetarian restaurant in the Monastery which is ok for a snack or drink.When walking down, take the path on the RHS of the courtyard at the pagoda end. This path wanders back down into Sha Tin, past some older local houses and brings you out in the Pei Tau village where you started."

            "review": "Astounding. Ten Thousand Buddhas MonasteryThis is not one of the top attractions than most tourists think of when coming to Hong Kong but I would consider it a must see. I have been to Hong Kong before and have been to the Peak, Stanley, Ngong Ping, etc. Why is Man Fat Sze a must see attraction, 1) Not touristy so you are surrounded by dozens of sightseers.2) Somewhat off the beaten track but easy to get to. Also free. 3) I've never seen a monastery like this and have been to many in China and Japan.How to get there: Take the MTR East rail to Shatin (light blue line on the MTR map). We caught the train from the large Hung Hom station (but I think you can also catch the train from East TST station - don't quote me). There are frequent trains about every 5-10 mins when we left about 11am. Look for a train with the destination Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau. Time about 15 minutes. When you arrive at Shatin Station, take exit B, turn left and walk down the ramp alongside the bus terminal. Walk about 50 metres till you reach Pai Tau St on the left (there is a large shopping centre on the corner with an Ikea). Walk down Pai Tau St about 20 metres till you reach Sheung Wo Che St on the right (Shatin Government Offices on the corner). At the end of this short dead end street is a yellow sign directing you to the monastery. Now for the hard bit, a steepish walk, (431 steps) pass \"lifesize\" golden individual statues (these are not the 10,000 buddhas but Arhans, monks who have not yet achieved full enlightenment to be considered a buddha). Check out all their amazing postures and facial impressions). At the top there is a small vegetarian restaurant. Then you go to a large courtyard where the temple is situated. There are actually about 13,000 small golden buddha ceramic statuettes surrounding the embalmed body of the founder of the monastery - Reverend Yuet Kai who is seated in a glass case. Also in the courtyard is a 9 storey pagoda which you can walk up via a spiral staircase and other pretty amazing statues.But wait, there's more - walk up another set of steps to the upper terrace where further renovations are being undertaken. There is a large Amitabha Buddha statute in one hall but walk further along and see a beautiful white statute of Kwun Yam in front of a waterfall, nice view of Shatin here too.As I said there is no entry fee, open 9-5.30pm daily and the monastery is looked after by lay people, who offer you a pamphlet in Chinese. We were warned about fake monks begging but didn't see any on the day we were there. We were told by one the the lay guides that you could take photos in the halls as long as you do not use a flash.Tip: go to the toilet at the railway station 1st"

They are all just larger than lifesize and each has its own expression and appearance. Most have an expession showing some degree of happiness, with some seeming to be caught in outright guffaws. Various ages, amounts of facial hair, and styles of clothing are used. Some have hair on their heads, although most are bald, some are surrounded with laughing children, and some are seated on the backs of animals. The monastery itself has quite a collection of small Buddhas, literally thousands, lining every inch of the inner walls. In the middle of the collection of buildings which are currently used you can see the dilapidated building which was the original monastic center established in the 1950's. The remaining buildings are impeccably maintained and beautiful. To me, as a westerner and non-Buddhist, this monastery seems quirky and even a bit out of sync with my image of Buddhist reverence and simplicity but it made for an interesting, peaceful, and enjoyable diversion from the usual Hong Kong frenzy."

We used the route recommended in the TripAdvisor App on Android as the monastery is not fully signposted from the station, and the App also suggests other must-see points. Words can't do justice to the wonderful colours and architecture of this place (and for the record there are allegedly nearer 13,000 buddhas at this site!). Only drawback is that the site is accessible by foot only, up 400+ winding steps so is not suitable for the mobility impaired. There is an old-fashioned Chinese bookstore and bee farm on the way down from the monastery, although these were closed on our visit."

One of the gaudiest temples I've seen but the atmosphere was very calm the time I visited and as I went around 9.30 am only a few visitors were there and the premises wasn't crowded. Plenty of statues along the way up and in the premises. Make sure that you visit the whole complex of temples rather than only the main worship hall. No photopgraphs are allowed inside the temple buidings unfortunately.On the way down, one can take the other exit which is through village houses and ends up near the Pau Tau village which itself is worth a gaze."

A great place to go and really explore. The complex is on two levels, so make sure you walk up the second set of stairs as well. Reading the history of the 'monastery' on the internet before we went to visit really enhanced the experience. The sheer number of Buddhas are amazing but some parts of the complex are not looked after and have a neglected feel about them. That aside, a must-see. Highly recommended. The gift shop here was by far the cheapest and most reasonably compared to some other temples we visited. A great place to pick up some souvenirs."

The entrance to the temple grounds is an easy but hard to find 5 minute walk from Shatin MTR station (others have provided directions which I won't expand on). Before you go anywhere, ensure you have some water (can be bought from the floor stall next to the entrance to the Ancestral halls or in the MTR station. The path (we take the one behind the government offices) is flanked by life sized gold laquered statues of monks in various poses. Each one is different and the kids had a great time counting them (until they lost count) and imitating them. The path is a steep climb (over 400 steps) so if you can't tackle steep terrain, this temple isn't for you. On arrival at the top of the steps and the main square, there is a small window from where drinks are sold. The main square has several large Buddha statues which have been recently painted and look pretty impressive. Around the outside the square are more life-sized buddhas in ever more bizarre poses (super-human like arms and legs, etc) and a pagoda which is depicted on the HK$10 banknote. The main prayer hall houses thousands of small buddha statues in the walls, again all in different poses. There are also large Buddha statues in front of which (rather creepily) is the embalmed and gold lacquered body of the founder of the the monastery in a glass case. Facing the prayer hall and going to the right takes you to yet further gardens and temples housing statues and it is this area which was devastated by a landslide in 1997. You can still see the effects of this landslide as rear of the house here is enveloped by the hill behind it. Finally you reach a stream area where there is a large white Kwan Yin statue standing on a dragon's back and further buddha statues flanking the stream.You can now return to the main square and exit in the right hand corner (furthest away from the main prayer hall). This takes you past yet more life-sized Buddha statues and into the village at the base of the hill. If you have time, you can visit the Wing Wo Bee Farm before rejoining civilisation. It's also worth peering into the old village houses right outside the MTR station at Pai Tau Village, a Grade III listed building.Also note, do not give money to any monks that you see in the area. They will be persistent but they are not real monks and the temple is trying to stop them begging. There have been several reports in HK papers regarding this and arrests have been made. A great FREE day out at an unusual, one of a kind temple. You can combine the trip with shopping in Shatin town or a visit to the Heritage Museum."

Turn left outside the exit and you'll be walking along a strip of stores for a couple minutes. At the end of that block you will be passing a cement floored outdoor soccer area, with the Square in front of you on the opposite corner. This is where you want to turn left, and you will walk 2 more (but very short) blocks, the first one is the Square, the 2nd one is a govt. building. After you have passed the govt building you will see a pretty gateway and car park. If you look up you can now see the 10,000 Buddha's Monastery area above you. Just walk along the wide sidewalk BETWEEN the govt bldg and the gated parking, the trail head is at the end of that walkway, leading up to your left and there is a sign once you start the trail. You've only walked about 5 min. from the station- it was much closer than we thought and we really enjoyed it. As well as the friendly local monkeys who appeared when we walked back down.

Along with the Hong Kong Heritage Museum in Shatin, it makes a great way to spend the better part of a day during a trip to Hong Kong. Unfortunately, it can be a bit tricky getting to this monastery, we don't recommend attempting to walk up to the temple through the village, its just a tad bit tricky if there are not lots of visitors coming down the other way. Instead, aim towards the IKEA building once you exit the Shatin MTR station, you'll need to find your way towards the back of the building that is behind the IKEA building, this is the where the steep footpath begins to ascend to the temple. Once you make your way towards that area, the path is easy to find and there will likely be others making their way up to the temple. Warning: This is a very steep climb and most require rest on occasion. We don't advise this for elderly visitors or those in poor health. While the path of paved, it is steep and takes a good 20 minutes to climb on a good day. The Benefit, if you can make it, is an astonishing number of great buddha statues to photograph. Perhaps the monkeys will be out to entertain you as well. During Chinese New Year, this is a great temple to visit, especially if you can catch the lion dances held there in the morning.

Between the building and the cemetery entrance, there is an alleyway that looks uninviting - trust us, walk up it, and you hit the trail for the climb flanked by awesome statues.Climb the 400+ steps slowly to grab pics of these statues and make your way up to the monastery. Either the statues are of monks or they are incarnations of Buddha - but they are not the 10,000 Buddhas of the title. This is reserved for the main hall of the monastery that has thousands of golden buddhas lining the walls. It helped that the weather was a gorgeous 20/70 degrees (C/F) and the sun was shining and that they had finished some of the construction work I had heard about. As it was New Year, there were lots of Hong Kongese praying, wishing and leaving tributes to Buddha, and it was a wonderful place to sit and watch people. We recommend going back out the way you came into the main part of the monastery and climbing up again as there are several gold statues in the hills and a beautiful white statue as well. Climb down the back way (by the main part of the monastery) and it's a quicker journey, but not as many statues.It was fun and beautiful and really worth the trip out there - it takes about 20/30 mins from TST with 2 changes but we go a taxi for about \u00a39 so we could see more of Hong Kong."

We followed the instructions in the previous reviews and found the Temple easily: I think if we had followed the official signposts we may have gone wrong a couple of times as some were placed in obscure positions. The Temple is on a hill, so be prepared for some steep slopes. Entry is free and allow about an hour for your visit.General tip: Real monks never beg."

            "review": "10000 Buddhas. I have something to add to LiveTraveling review, I just went there based on his review and there are 2 ways to get there. After you walk past the Central Home Plaza mall, make a right on the street in between the back of the mall and in front of the Sha Tin gov't office. Cross the street to the gov't office sidewalk and walk it towards the end of the street. You'll see a small waist high, yellow sign in English. As of this review, there are fences on that part covering the vegetation only, the walk way path is clear to the start of the site. I came back from the site using this path following the locals.If you happen to walk past the gov't office make sure you follow the building because you are walking behind the gov't office to get there. Do not walk up on the street to the other temple because that way doesn't connect to the 10000 buddha path. You should be within literally an arms length from the building when walking this way. The monastery doesn't solicit and like a fool, we gave the monk some money but he was persistent... After I walked down, I heard some locals saying they don't recognize him from the area and that he spoke Mandarin which should give it away. You don't know if he's a monk or something else in guise. We only made it up to the first temple before it started to rain. There's a restaurant up there if you need to get water and drinks. This is the first time, I've been here after coming to HK for the 3rd time.I would also second the recommend using the bathroom at the mall before going back to the train station."

            "review": "Fantastic - a must do. we followed the detail directions below and had no trouble getting there. definitely go up the back way like suggested. you get to see the buddhas better and if your walking down you don't see them as well. We walked up the slop most (not the stairs) of the way and think this saved our legs a bit. It wasn't that hard of a walk probably took us 15min to get to the top and we stopped a few times a long the way. Once you get to the top it's amazing, to your right are a few more steps to some smaller temples. to your left are the big 10000 buddhas temple. It is amazing you can go inside and take photo's but no flash. It only took us max 1 1/2 hours to do the whole thing and from tst it took us 15min on the train and we had to change twice. The best thing is it is another free activity in hk. We did give the monks some small change and i'm not sure if that was right - if they were part of the temple or just beggers. They were pretty persistent."

            "review": "Detailed Directions. I am living in Hong Kong, but I used the reviews here to get me to the 10,000 Buddhas. The directions were lacking so here are detailed directions to help you on your journey...Take the East Rail Line to the Sha Tin stop (1st class is only $4 HK more from Hung Hom)Go out Exit B (you will see buses)Go left outside the exit and follow everyone down the pedestrian rampAt the end of the ramp there is an Information Pole with a purplish red sign for the Government Building, which you can follow. OR better yet do the following...Follow Pui Tau Street toward the left.You will see a Mall across the street, currently called Home Square. Cross the street here and go to the left, which will continue to be Pui Tau Street. Pass the Sha Tin Government Building on your right (you are still on Pui Tau Street).You will see a very impressive white cemetery entrance next. (It is a large complex with escalators and stairs, but this is NOT 10,000 Buddhas.) Before you cross the car park entry in front of you to reach the cemetery entrance, there will be a cement path on the right. You will easily miss it since it is between a building and a cement wall with no sign. Take this cement path behind the building and then to the left. You will start seeing the gold buddhas as you start up the hill. If you have any questions about where to go, there are attendants in the cemetery parking area just 30 feet up the ramp. I had to ask directions for the 10,000 Buddhas. The man was very nice and walked me down the ramp and pointed me down the cement path. Please, please ask for directions if you have gotten this far. All you need to say is \"10,000 Buddhas?\" although a lot of people understand English in Hong Kong.Enjoy the walk!A few recommendations for your journey...- Use the first class compartment on the East Rail Line. The small extra cost is worth it.- There are nice bathrooms on the 1st level in the mall I mentioned above. Pacific Coffee Company is located on the 2nd level...as of January 2010...possibly a good place to stop and relax after your walk.- There are two routes to go up to the top and then back down again. I recommend using the entrance route I described for going up. Although I believe this route up doesn't not have any handrails, I didn't miss them going up. The other route that you could use to go down has a limited amount of buddhas, but there is a hand rail. I suggest that you determine if using a handrail is important to you while making the walk up. If so, take the other route down, but it isn't as impressive. This route will take you through a village but it didn't show the local flavor.- There are three levels of the monastery so make sure you see them all. I recommend going all the way up to the silver statue with a tall waterfall in the back. You can enter the small building all the way up to the 2nd floor. It was a nice experience.- There was a person walking around with a yellow name tag, but the tag did not indicate she worked for the monastery. She didn't tell me her intention, but she was happy to try to give my two year old son and later me a \"good fortune\" card. I quickly declined because on the streets of Hong Kong this is technique used to get you to give them money. I err on the side of caution because this lady failed to talk or pay attention to my local friend. Also, I didn't appreciate her trying to give something to my son without asking. I was happy to make a donation myself in the donation boxes located everywhere in the monastery.- A general rule in Hong Kong is that religious organizations do not go soliciting money. The locals I know do not give money to any organization or monks on the street collecting money. They just totally ignore them or just say, \"no money\". I'm told that all the solitors on the street are fake. I've learned that being rude, or what Westerners consider being rude, is not harsh at all around here. - If you are looking to do something while you are out in the New Territories, please read on... We made this walk in the morning and ended close to lunch time. A good way to continue your day is to take the East Rail Line back toward Hung Hom, but get off at Kowloon Tong. Switch over to the Green Line and go a couple stops to Diamond Hill. Here you can follow the signs to Nan Lian Garden and Chi Lin Nunnery. (I would do a web search for specific directions because I forget the exact route. The good thing is that the signs are very good to get you there...not like 10,000 Buddhas.) Nan Lian Garden is impressive to take a leisurely walk around. There is a nice restaurant located inside where seating underneath a water fall. This would make a nice relaxing stop for lunch, which can be hard to find in Hong Kong. Continue walking across to the Nunnery. I hope this information helps you on your travels."

            "review": "Out Of The Usual. BTW, I lived in HK for a bit and I dint even KNOW about this place until recently!!Its away from the mad hustle of the city, and although the city has its own charm, this place is very serene and beautiful. I loved the trek up the 400something steps. All the way up on either side you will find golden buddha statues, not any two the same! How to get there: Take the MTR & KCR to the Shatin stop.Take exit B. When you exit (after inserting your ticket in the machine) take a left and follow the road down until you reach a road on your left. Take the left onto the road and keep walking until the end. On the right (before the big gate) you will find a tiny sign that reads '10,000 Buddhas'. Its a small sign so be alert for it."

            "review": "Spectacular!. This is a must-see attraction in Hong Kong. Although there are more than 400 steps to climb, it's a very pleasant hike. The path is lined with lots of buddhas so you can take lots of photos imitating their poses and expressions!At the top, the actual temple houses little golden buddhas, all with unique poses. This had to be one of the most amazing sights I ever came across in my life. The giant Kwan Yu and Guan Yin statues outside were not shabby either.There's also vegetarian restaurant (we didn't try as we didn't know before hand) at the top, which serves lunch for HKD45 - quite the bargain."

There is a sign to point you in the right direction, but it still wasn't clear to use which way to go - we got probably a stone throw away and due to it being late in the afternoon and very warm we didn't try and locate the correct path. Maybe next time!"

            "review": "a must see. This place is under construction currently and that's probably why it's not in many guide books. At the big buddha, there are several signs asking for donations for the 10,000 site. So, this place will only get better from now. That being said, it is already a must see! Other reviews have the specific directions which is helpful. I say just go to Sha Tin station and ask a staff member. They'll point you in the right direction. There is a sign or two which will help you along the way too. Not too tough to find. Seeing all the golden statues on the hike up is sweet. Taking picures imitating each pose is so fun even for a 28-year-old like myself. I'm a kid at heart! Once you get to the top, the view is great and so is the monastery. All the mini statues inside and the bigger ones outside make for quite the site. This is a must see in my opinion. Free of charge but I donated a little at the top."

            "review": "Man Fat Monastary aka Ten Thousand Buddhas. www.10kbuddhas.org is the main web site to visit before heading to the 10K monastary. It's a good place to start and determine if you want to hike up the hill or not. The monastary is located in the New Territories at a town called Shatin pai Tau Village, just outside of the Hong Kong city.When and who were the travelers : Late September and three single females in their late 20s.Getting there:We took the train from Hong Kong to the KCR Sha Tin Railway Station. I don't remember how long the ride was, but it was more than 1/2 hr. Taking the train was easy because on each car of the train (at least the one we took) had electronical maps of the train route under the exit/entrance door. There is a blinking light indicating where the train is located on the route. The name of each location on the map were both in Chinese characters and English, which made our journey easy. When we got off, we took the Exit B, walked down the pedestrian ramp and saw the hills to the left. Look for a RED Pagoda, it should be clearly visible from KCR Station. Walk a few blocks north and you'll see an IKEA store sign. Turn left onto Pai Tau Street. Keep to the right side of the road and follow it around to the gate where the signposted path starts. There should be a gray building to the right and the cemetary entrance to the left. This pathway is the best side to reach the top of the monastary. Don't be confused by the White Pagoda on the left of Pai Tau Road. That's the cemetary, not the temple. If you see an escalator and a pretty landscape, you're at the wrong entrace. We made the mistake of going to the cemetary and not look for the sign posted for the monastary. It was all good... we paid respect to ancestors we didn't know.Weather in Sept:It was sunny with scattered shower. Our unbrella were very handy because we used it for both the sunny weather and for the rain. Since we didn't know where we where going, we brought water bottles and snacks for each. We visited on a weekday and so there were hardly any people visiting the area.Attire:We wore long pants, short sleeve shirt and took a light sweater. We wore good walking shoes because there are over 400 steps to climb.Experience:Going up the hill was an easy hike because there are small steps and hand railing on the side to hold on to as you hike up. There are many statues along side the pathway with different emotional expression. Climbing the stairs were exciting at first... after a few hundred steps we needed something to stay excited. Throughout the climb, we started posing with or as the same position as the statues. It kept us busy and entertained. If you have kids, you can have them count the number of statues as they go up. Eventhough each one has numbers... I lost count.Reaching the top was not as I expected... It was quiet (it was a weekday) and it's a flat area on top. I didn't do any research on the monastary before going there. When you reach the top, you are entering from the back corner of the 10K Buddhas Temple. With all the climbing up the hill we got hungry (it was lunch time)and found a small local restaurant on top by the monastary. It should be at the same corner as you took your last hike to the monastary. When you are facing the 10K Buddhas Temple, the local restaurant is to your right side (by the Refectory of the Monastary). To your left is the office and the public restroom. Always bring your own toilet paper. To your back (or across the 10K Buddhas Temple) is the Red Pagoda.In the 10K Buddhas Temple, there is a little store that sells mini souvenirs at very minimal cost. You can also light an incent to pay respect (but not at the main temples), donate money to the monastary for the up keeping, or simply enjoy the temple and the surrounding statues. There is no obligation to anything. Heading down hill, you can take the same pathway or take a rugged path. The rugged path is not like hiking down a jungle, but there are broken path; and that path goes to the back yard of people residence. When looking at the Red Pagoda, with the 10K Buddhas Temples behind you, the rugged pathway exit is located to your right between the Pagoda and Samantabhadra (the White elephant statue which is to the right of the Pagoda). I don't suggest taking this path for those that needs to hold on to railingsI don't remember how long the hike to the top took us, but it was worth for us to see something new and the view was great!"

            "review": "10,000 Golden Buddhas Monastery. The 10,000 Buddhas is worth the steep climb. There are two paths to the main buildings on top of a hill. Leaving the North exit of the KCR station, make your way through the bus terminal and look to the hills to the left. You will see two Pagodas on the top of the hill. The closest Pagoda , white with red trim, is the cemetery. It has a beautiful entrance and escalators but is not the 10,000 Buddhas Monastery. The trail on the left begins in what is left of an old Chinese village and is the steeper of the two choices. Behind the IKEA is a more gentle path. Both paths are lined with golden Buddhas, and you may want to climb one and descend the other. The temple at the top has walls covered with thousands of small Buddhas. The Pagoda has many Buddhas looking out from every window. Seeing the preponderance of Buddhas displayed both outdoors on the path and indoors at the temple is like nothing we have ever come across before. Available is water, sodas, and a few vegetarian treats at the main temple square."
