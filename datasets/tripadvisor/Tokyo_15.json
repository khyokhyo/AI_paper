The island itself is a modern entertainment centre so good for teenagers maybe small kids too. we did the Ferris wheel which gives you spectacular views of the bay and the skyline. go at dusk and you get both daylight and then lights as the evening descends, middle of August early evening Friday no queues ! the Toyota car area is interesting for petrol heads you can even test drive ?? on their track . ( this activity is not open after about 6pm) .I would suggest you check the map of the area work out which bits will be interesting to the relevant members of your family and you will find something for everyone. Don't go here for a culinary experience, most restaurants are Western attempts ! and far too pricey for what they are so stick with fast food outlet or takeaway. This is a fun modern Japan experience ."

There is a big takoyaki court where you can try out several different variations of the superb little octopus-balls. And there is a huge movie and arcade center, with all sorts of fun games for companies too."

The waters at the beach are too polluted to do anything but wade in (wash your feet when you're crazy enough to do that) and it's overcrowded with nothing but shopping and third-class attractions. Even the ferris wheel can be outdone by too many others around Japan to count.I stay in Hamamatsucho, when I'm in Japan, and my hotel's room always faces that man-made island and Tokyo Bay. The only thing worth doing to get to Odaiba is walking across the Rainbow Bridge and back to Hamamatsucho.On top of that, the kitschy imitation of the Statue of Liberty is an insult to Japan's culture.

            "review": "Good for \"a whole day\" :). Was really impressed with this big man-made island on the land reclaimed from the Tokyo Bay, with big buildings and highways just like on a mainland.I went over the overpass after coming out of Odaibakaihinkoen Station to the other side, taking about 10 minutes; but my suggestion is go down to the street on the side of the station and start the tour at Decks Mall right there, and then Aqua City Mall beside it, but \"be sure\" to get to the other side of the buildings, where the boardwalk area is, because that's the \"fun side\" with: the great smaller-scale replica of the Statue of Liberty (just to view though, a little too far to touch and not big enough to go inside) right beside the boardwalk alongside the waters of the Tokyo Bay, a great view of the Rainbow Bridge, the fairly-spacious Odaiba beach (a decent length, but not a great width), and some music-blaring cafes in the vicinity of the beach; inside Decks itself, there's Madame Tussauds wax museum (I didn't go into it since I've been to two others) and there's Joypolis indoor theme park (not my thing, but maybe a \"must place\" for those with kids); and right behind Aqua City is Fuji TV Building with a big globe above (with little windows around it, must be the observation place, but I'm not sure if the views would be too good since the building's not too high). Not to be missed after all the stuff as mentioned above at the boardwalk area near the water is the big Gundam Robot right outside Diver City (after going inland from the boardwalk past Fuji TV Building for just like 5 minutes), a great photo-op \"free of charge\", and yes it's a pretty tall & towering robot!Finally rounding off your Odaiba tour would be Venus Fort at Palette Town (about a 5-to-10-minute walk from Diver City but from the other side of the Robot); go inside and you'll be \"in a different place at a different time\", namely in a 'town in Italy' in the '16th or 17th century' (with quaint two-storied row houses, a splendid fountain and a church plaza with a pretty imposing church fa\u00e7ade on the far end), although inside the stores (on the first floor of the row houses) are just regular stuff as at any other shopping mall. And yes, look up inside this indoor mall and you'll see the 'sky'!And after Venus Fort, the way back to the metro station (Odaibakaihinkoen Station) is just across the big open area in front to the overpass on the other side and a 10-minute walk along it to the other end where the station is. So, doing this kind-of-circular way from the boardwalk area (with Decks & Aqua City) to the Gundam Robot at Diver City to Venus Fort at Palette Town would save you from walking the length of the overpass back & forth (like I did).As for getting here, the most economical way is to take the metro Yurikamome Line from Shimbashi Station to Odaibakaihinkoen Station on the trip that takes just about 15 minutes along the outdoor & \"above-ground\" route with great views of the Tokyo Bay. There's also a more-expensive option of taking a ferry along the Sumida River (I believe the ferry's from the Asakusa area in the north & going back there)."

It originated as a set of small man made fort islands (daiba literally means \"fort\"), which were built towards the end of the Edo Period (1603-1868) to protect Tokyo against possible attacks from the sea and specifically in response to the gunboat diplomacy of Commodore Perry.More than a century later, the small islands were joined into larger islands by massive landfills, and Tokyo began a spectacular development project aimed to turn the islands into a futuristic residential and business district during the extravagant 1980s.

We also went to the beach to watch sunset which was by rainbow bridge (which only lights up rainbow a few times a year to our disappointment). All in all, we would recommend Odaiba to anyone who has a few days to spare in Tokyo."

The beach is lovely and it is a small walk to see the replica of the statue of liberty. We also saw the full size Gundam which is always impressive. And ended up on the ferris wheel in the fully transparent car giving a spectacular view of the city. We visited Madame Tussaud's which was fun and tested our knowledge of famous Japanese people."

During the cruise you would be able to go up to the open deck and enjoy the beautiful view along the Tokyo Bay water front and the sumida riverside areas including many Tokyo many beautiful structure . It's takes about an hour trip definitely worth the 1550 yen spent . What I love about it is that you can enjoy both new and old Tokyo ."

Wasn't busy at all and worth the 640 yen return ticket."

We decided to catch the 30 min train over to Odaiba from Shinjuku station and walk back over the Rainbow Bridge into the city. You can use your JR pass part way then pay the difference at the last station (approx $6.00 AUD) It a little land of fun for kids or adults. Located out on a man made island, Odaiba has several large shopping malls with your usual brand name stores with Japanese brands mixed in. Lots of places to walk around if you are into people watching. You'll also find plenty to eat. If you're into architecture your eyes will have a feast in this part of Tokyo. Especially the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, known as the Miraikan by locals. The main attractions for us were the Rainbow Bridge, miniature Statue of Liberty and Giant Gangdam. Also, were lucky enough to be there the day a Tokyo drift competition was on which was pretty exhilarating!"

It's strange -- I didn't expect to enjoy Odaiba so much but I have to say, it was a great way to spend a whole day and I've since been back several times to show family and friends who come visit me in Tokyo from abroad.The first time around, I went with my boyfriend. We took the monorail in from Shinbashi. Try to get a seat in the front, if you can! There's a great view of the ride if you get the front two seats. When we arrived, we were surprised at how wide all the roads were and how spaced out some of the buildings were. Although I love the use of small space in other areas of Tokyo, it felt like a nice change of pace to be somewhere more open. We spent a lot of time perusing the shops at DiverCity. We ate lunch at the food court there and had some snacks at some of the cafes inside. It got pretty crowded at some points but we never had to wait a super long time to reach the register at any of the shops or restaurants we tried. If you're a Gundam fan, it's pretty cool to see the Gundam up close right outside DiverCity. Somehow the pictures don't do it justice! The build quality is really nice in real life, and the little light shows put on throughout the day are fun to watch if you happen to catch them. On another visit, we went to the onsen with friends and shopped around. Basically, there's a lot to do in Odaiba and you can likely find an enjoyable activity for each person in your party."

The hotel was excellent and transport into Tokyo by the monorail was amazing. The station was literally a 5 minute walk and the journey fast and easy to the main stations. Odaiba is fantastic, lots to do locally if you just want a lazy day. Sites such as the mini statue of Liberty, Giant robot model, Three shopping center, views of the river, rainbow bridge and Tokyo all on your doorstep. We will definitely stay there again when we return in the late Summer. I recommend it for anyone who does not want to be in downtown Tokyo but be close by it!"

Odaiba was wonderful for shopping in general, but I'm going to focus my review from a dog-lovers point of view, because I found only a small amount of information on dog related stores here when I was doing my own research. I own 2 chihuahuas and a miniature dachshund and I wanted to bring accessories back to the UK for them. Odaiba is a must see if you are looking for dog items in Tokyo.If you have dogs of your own and want to shop for them, make sure you go to Palette Town Mall and Aqua City Mall. The bottom floors of these malls are positively a dog owners paradise. There are lots of shops focused on dogs - from dog clothes, to collars, harnesses, bags, pushchairs, toys, general care etc. There are also dog friendly cafes, bakeries, play stations, and grooming parlours if you happened to have your dog with you. There is even a place were you can pose with your dog (or show a photo) and have a caricature drawn!My favourite shop was Pet Paradise in Palette Town Mall (they also own Harness Dog in Aqua City Mall, both stores have almost identical products but Pet Paradise is the larger one with more choice). I bought coats, kimonos and dresses here. I also purchased a dog bag and a dog rucksack from other stores in the malls. The clothing from Pet Paradise is really lovely quality - I paid and exchange rate of around \u00a315 -\u00a325 per item - this seems a lot but the quality is really worth it. They also offer special long sizes for dachshunds, which I have never seen before. I had measured my dogs prior to leaving the UK and took a small tape measure to measure the garments, but they do help you determine size if you don't have this. On returning to the UK all the items I bought fit perfectly on my dogs.One of my dogs has problems with his knees and can't always walk - it was fantastic to be able to buy comfortable bags for him to sit in if we go for walks and he gets sore. Finding quality products like this in the UK is hard.It is great fun to people - and dog - watch here. Many Japanese people seem to bring their dogs here, most are pampered in cute outfits, bags and prams. I wish we had malls like this in the UK!"

These 3 shopping complex are pretty much interconnected by a pedestrian bridge however they are only half covered so we still had to utilise an umbrella. Aqua city had good views of Tokyo and the rainbow bridge, Diver city had the giant Gundam which was impressive (not a Gundam fan) and the highlight @ Palette Town is the Toyota Mega Web where there were plenty of free interactive activities as well current Toyota car display and also prototypes. Aqua city & Diver City are pretty much your normal shopping complex while Palette Town has an outlet floor which we found to be really expensive for an Outlet while the rest of Palette Town is decorated in a fake Italian style which was pretty tacky. I wouldn't recommend Odaiba as a must see place but if you have plenty of time in Tokyo and it is raining, you could give Odaiba a visit."

Were served barely over a half flute and had to call 2 waiters to convince them that it was an unreasonable serving - they reluctantly topped up to a 2/3 glass.

It's a great family attraction, just walking around can be fun. It's also much better in good weather, as the majority of the island is outdoors. I personally went for the onsen, but it was packed with a line going around the block! The 'beach' area is nice with plenty of couples and families picnicking. In all honesty though, if you're only in Tokyo for a few days, I'd skip Odaiba. It's a lot bigger than I thought, so walking from one end to the other takes close to an hour. Oh and a side note - the monorail style train coming in to the island is actually really cool - all the kids had a great time sitting at the front going around the corners!"

The walk from the station to the mall outside which the Gundam statue is placed is quite pleasant. If you just want to see the statue, you don't need to enter the mall - just walk around the mall till you see it. The statue was definitely impressive. Even if you are not a Gundam fan or don't know a thing about it, it still looks great. From there, we saw the replica of the Statue of Liberty - it looks really nice against the backdrop of a bridge and the Tokyo skyline...makes for some very nice pics. If one has more time, you can spend it in the malls and entertainment parks, but just walking around the place itself is a nice experience.

One can spend a whole day there alone and with family. It is a shopping centre, boat rides, Fuji TV studio, Tokyo Big Sight (exhibition hall for art and antique market), Tokyo Leisure for video games, bowling and karaoke, Food court with many different international restaurant, but my favorite is a whole floor of specializing in all type of Ramen (Japanese Noodle soup). Plus much much more... Oh there is also movie cinemas as well. If you run out of things to do in Tokyo (not that you will), Odaiba is definitely a place to visit."

As a non-Japanese, I'm not really interested in living in a foreign country, and doing the same stuff I used to do in my native land. What makes a different culture seem appealing, is that it's DIFFERENT. But Odaiba is simply not Japanese. The first fact that gives it away as being among the worst consequences of globalization, is that only about 10% of the people in Odaiba are Japanese (mostly just the employees of the many shops). So call me strange, because I prefer to submerge myself in the culture of the country I visit... For this reason, I hated Odaiba."

As we got to Sega quite late, we were offered the \"evening pass\" . Even though we had fun, we only went on aproximately 6 or 7 games as they were either closing or closed. Because of this, I believe it would have been cheaper for us to pay separately. Also, I didn't enjoy Tokyo Ghoul and felt it was a complete waste of time -it was however quite fun being rushed through a maze by two staff shouting japanese at you (in character) about the \"approaching dangers\" (I don't speak japanese so it added to the authenticity for me) :)As it was really raining on our last day, we went back to Odaiba and spent probably close to 6 hours there.We went to the Gundam museum (again, my partner enjoyed it but it was too short for the money paid- although, viewing the cartoon in the dome was great -and I don't even know who Gundam is!) :)We also went to Hiro to eat the most delicious hamburger meat ever! And visited a few shops (duchess as 3 coins).It was all topped off with a view of the \"statue of liberty\", cherry blossom and rainbow bridge .We probably would come back as I feel we only saw the tip of the iceberg !"

The train ride via the Yurikamome line is incredible, as it's an above ground train that goes over Tokyo Harbor. The views are wonderful, and was an added bonus to our trip to Odaiba. Once at Odaiba, there are a lot of helpful maps and signs pointing you where to go. We were only going to go for the Miraikan, but we noticed that Diver City and the Giant Gundam robot were only a short walk away from the museum. After visiting the robot we went to the harbor by Odaiba station and took in the beautiful views. This was a great place to come, I would even consider staying here for one night on a long Tokyo stay."

We like Venusfort a lot better, they had different shops to the ones that we found at the plazas and malls. Go to the Hobby trail place, lots of things to looks at. We had the best Indian food there, go to level 3, there is a little food court- looks bit dodge- but judging by all the japanese people there, it must be good. The indian restaurant, the guy there makes the naan in a traditional oven - sorry can't remember the name. The naan was soon good, we ordered 3 to have with our curries. Well priced delicious food - there were other restaurants on the other levels as well but over priced for the tourists :) We took our girls on the ferris wheel, could of spent a lot more time browsing, but the munchkins were getting tired.

Had some ice cream then when we qent back they rold us ot was to full very disappointing. So if your told to come back think twice about it.Apart from that the day was great. Went to the big Toyota showroom which was cool. They had a 4d ride in there which the kids loved. If you have an international driving licence you can test drive the cars. We went on the big ferris wheel there were great views across to Tokyo. Just a bit scary to experience an earthquake from the top of the ferris wheel though but i guess its just anotjer day in Tokyo.Shopping was also good here. Wish we had more time to explore the shops.All in all a very good day."

The area is composed of roughly three malls, Diver City, Aqua City, and Decks. Odaiba also has Japan's replica of New York's Statue of Liberty. Very very close to the original. Being an area near the sea side, Odaiba was a really relaxing place to visit with the cool breeze and the picturesque views. In Diver City, don't forget to visit the bif gundam figure outside. You may stroll inside the mall for some good finds. We also went to Aqua City but got disappointed we did not find the restaurant I heard that served ramen from different places in Japan. Decks on the other hand has Madam Tussauds, Legoland Museum, and Takoyaki Museum. We went at the last place since it's free and you only have to buy takoyaki from one of the many stalls. Madam Tussauds and Legoland Museum both required entrance fees so we did not bother go inside anymore. Fuji Televesion Building is also found in that area. Take some photos and that's it. I think outsiders are not allowed access."

The Toyota showcase had new Toyota cars on display as well as a free car museum with many classic cars. You can even ride newer Toyota cars around a track that travels through and outside the building. Outside there is a giant Ferris wheel to ride as well. The giant Gundam robot is impressive even for those not into the anime. It really looks like a working machine. There are a few malls in Odaiba and they all offer a huge amount of dinning choices and interesting shops. There are a few arcades with very unique games and one of the biggest is run by Sega. You can sit in a real Dodge Viper car while racing on a screen in front. The car is on hydraulics and moves while playing. The best way to visit Odaiba is to plan to stay until evening. Tokyo harbor and Rainbow bridge look amazing at night along with the neon lit party cruisers dotting the water. So much to see and do for everyone."

The couple of cons about the Island is that it can be relatively expensive to travel there compared to other areas on the mainland, and it possesses few 'traditional' Japanese sites. But otherwise, it is amazing for shopping and having fun. In particular, we love going to Diver City shopping centre and Leisureland in Pallette Town to play the UFO games/machines. LOTS of fun! I also recommend the Ferris Wheel on a clear day as it gives you a beautiful view of Tokyo. As someone who is scared of heights, it was pretty frightening for me, but I just held on (it is very slow which was my issue!) and focused on what I could see instead :) We also enjoy walking through the Toyota Megaweb- a must for any Toyota or car fan. The Shopping in Diver City is good with a variety of mid to high range stores. We also recommend venturing into the Decks shopping centre and checking out the buffet (during lunch or dinner peak hours, otherwise food is cold) and the nick nack stores that have anime merchandise and treat boxes. Overall a fun location that is easy to walk around. I also recommend going to the Maritime Museum in Odaiba to find out more about the Island's history!We're looking forward to returning to Odaiba next time we come to Tokyo!"

You can wait for a new train and get the best seats in front of the car. Get off at either Odaibakaihinkoen or Daiba. There's an amazing viewpoint, a small statue of liberty, great beach and park, shopping, restaurants, and great fururistic architecture.

And for those who would like to contemplate, this place also offers a great view of the Rainbow Bridge as well as a closer encounter of a smaller scale Statue of Liberty. And if you\u2019re a big spender and would like to spend on itsy bitsy and teeny weeny kind of things, the Aqua City offers five floors of shopping ground with so many restaurants and shops to choose from. Lastly, don\u2019t let your curiosity kill you since this place has a science museum that features latest and futuristic technologies by Sony. And should your feet get tired and seeks to relax, a cinema complex is available to accommodate that need."

Well, Odaiba was one of a few options left for us and it didn't disappoint either!!! You need to cone there early. The family ride on the highest ferry wheel in the world for only \u00a53,080 is a great start of the day. Also Ride Studio that is next door to the ferry wheel entrance is a must one for the little ones. Kids up to 6 years old drive for free, older ones pay \u00a5300 for training and \u00a5200 to get their licence, our kids absolutely loved that, but you need to queue early to make a reservation. Toyota Mega Web is full of entertainment including full size human robot, lots of new cars on free access display and simulator ride experience in a small theater that runs 20mins. Don't need to mention Venus Fort and shopping, we loved it all!!!"

Frankly, a cheaper 2 ways ticket is sufficient, ride the train, take a round trip to the last station and back to the station you wish to see is the most comfortable way to take a glimpse of this island since most of the 'actions' are close by Daiba station, all within walking distance. Came with high expectations and left disappointed, but my kids loved it. My girl called it the Japanese theme park, an better alternative to Disney Land and Sea ( she refused to revisit Tokyo Disney which we visited once years ago). The old fashioned arcade at Decks with some vintage stuffs was most interesting to me. Rainbow bridge, 'statue of liberty' and the Christmas illuminations were nice at night and we could see Tokyo Tower from here too.

You can even use your PASMO card on the monorail. We loved Odaiba and went there twice. Its a lot more relaxed and open than the rest of Tokyo which is refreshing. We missed out on so much stuff here (Miraikan, Onsen bath, Ferris wheel, Toyota Megaweb, etc) but we did visit the Fuji-TV building which has great views, Madame Tussauds in the Decks complex (a huge shopping mall) and Joypolis. Joypolis is an indoor theme park and we went in after 5pm so got the cheaper night ticket which is all you really need. Being indoors, its not huge like Disneyland but there are a number of rides and we really enjoyed it. We also ate (twice) at the Dog Dept Cafe on the harbour side of the Decks complex and while not cheap, the food was great although not authentic japanese, more japanese blended western style. However, as the name suggests, this is a cafe where owners can take their dogs and the dogs have their own menu to order from. We thought it was really cool but others may disagree. You can also buy clothes for your pooch here as well as yourself although prices are high. We caught the glass topped water taxi from Odaiba to Asakusa but felt it was expensive and not really worth the trip, the monorail was our favourite method of getting to Odaiba."

Part of the mall is modelled after an old European city and is particularly beautiful with its high painted ceilings made to look like the sky.The ferris wheel is fun if you're not scared of heights and gives a great view of the area.There is a huge Toyota display area and a large collection of old cars and even tiny model ones as well.

We then crossed over the bridge and took the wide paved walk to the Divercity Mall.Inside the Mall, we came across a huge food court that was full of people eating. In the food court, there were a lot of different types of food to eat, but we had already eaten our lunch so we just looked and passed on through.We went up to several of the shops in the upper floors of the mall and I bought some chocolate mocha and some cookies for my co-workers to try. They must have good, as the omiyage did not last very long at work.We were quite tired, since we had just come from the Ueno Zoo and Ameyahocho Street, so we headed back to Shibuya. The Yurikamome rail is a little smaller than any of the JR or Toei line trains, so the cars appear to be more crowded. I was surprised to see so many people on the train at 2:00pm in the afternoon. I think we should have stayed longer in Odaiba, but we were tired and we didn't have to do any shopping. I can see how people can spend an entire day there and not get bored, as it is a pretty amazing place to visit."

We decided to head to Odaiba for the robot museum (Miraikan) but ended up staying (and returning) for the trick art museum (pretty cool photos here but not worth just walking around without a camera), the ferris wheel (one of the biggest in the world), the toyota showcase (if you have an international drivers license you can test drive toyotas we don't even have for 300yen on their cool track and they also had cars from around the world, historical galery and a look at some of the cars they have prototypes of) and the shopping. Over all it's not \"must see Tokyo\" and with less time we would have skipped it but there is a lot of cool touristy things to do out that way. You can also get a picture of their replica of the statue of liberty with the tokyo tower in the background (which looks a lot like the eiffel tower) which may confuse people back home about where you actually went."

It's conveniently located where the shopping and restaurants can be accessed via the walkway right outside the hotel. Facing the ocean, there's the Statue of Liberty and Rainbow Bridge. To the right of the hotel are Aqua City and Decks. If you stay on the walkway and head in the direction opposit the Statue of Liberty, you will see Diver City. It's one of the best places to shop and eat. If you keep walking straight and away from the Statue of Liberty, you will get to a park. Cross the street and keep walking straight and you will get to the Museum of Emerging Science and Innovations on the right. If you cross the next street and turn right, then go left about a block or so, you will get to Oedo Onsen. I highly recommend this place. There's a $24.80 entrance fee. You will need to remove your footwear and place it in a locker, then choose a yukata. Go to the dressing room and wear the yukata. Your clothes will be left in another locker. Get a massage. It's so good. You'll have to pay for that. Go to the foot bath and get the fish to eat the dead skin off your feet. Pay for that experience, too. Then shop at their food court and have lunch or browse through their store and buy some wonderful Japanese goods."

Because of the onsen place (Oedo Onsen Monogatari) that's available beside Telecom Centre station and the huge shopping malls that's around the place. Tokyo Diver City is a huge shopping mall with many different kind of shops plus that 1:1 scale Gundam is just right outside the mall. I went in early October this year and there's a Odaiba Oktoberfest that's right beside Tokyo Diver City and it's AMAZING. There are performances by the Germans and many different kind of German beers that's available. Entrance fee is free so you're have to just pay for the beer. Recommended to visit Odaiba when you're in Tokyo as it's a great place to do some shopping and sight seeing. Not to mention the amazing onsen place too!"

Originally built to protect Tokyo from a sea invasion, today the \"man made\" fort island has become a popular shopping and entertainment district. Odaiba is broken down into its own smaller districts of shopping, fun, entertainment.The Fuji TV Building is headquarters for Japans private TV stations. The building is one of the most clever futuristic architectural creations and certainly worth a look. The observation deck provides great views too. Decks, a shopping mall featuring various stores, includes Joypolis, Legoland,and multiple indoor themed centres. Aquacity is another shopping mall featuring various stores, restaurants, cafes and a 13 screen cinema complex. The fifth floor provides the best views of Rainbow Bridge, especially at night whilst enjoying the Ramen food. DiverCity Tokyo Plaza is a representation of Japans anime, and again is an entertainment district within itself  Telecom Center Observation Deck actually provides views of Mount Fuji on clear days and again is a great place to capture the illumination of the bridge at night. Museum of Maritime Science is housed in a cruise ship that sits alongside the waterfront of Odaiba.National Museum of Emerging Science also known as Miraikan is an interactive bilingual science museum that exhibits environmental issues, robots, biology & space exploration.Palette Town for me was the real hub of Odaiba with the beauty of the Venus Fort shopping mall that words cannot describe, Toyota Mega Web will allow you to experience the sheer pleasure of the latest model cars and technology. There are some exciting attractions/rides here for yourself and the kids to enjoy.Leisureland and the Ferris wheel are also worth taking in. Odaiba provides a whole day of entertainment and is a great escape from the Tokyo City Shock."

I recommend to drop by palette town, check ferris wheel, then head to Gundam front at diver city, then go to the observation deck in front of aqua city for rainbow bridge. And visit it at night, preferably come at 6, if too early wander around palette town and venus fort for a while."

So get there as early as possible. Endless amounts of shops and restaurants. Fun attractions for the whole family too. We did Legoland and Madam Tussaud's, the big wheel, and saw the Gundam robot show. We ran out of time for Joyopololis, the museums and Sony building. We took the monorail over rainbow bridge which was great for photos of Odaiba and then the Tokyo train back. Gotta see this place if you travel to Tokyo area."

Not the only way but the best way to get there (IMHO) is on Tokyo's water bus that you can catch in Asakusa. Short and sweet? We could've spent the whole day here and probably won't even cover all the attractions this place had to offer. Anyways I came all this way just to see the Statue of Liberty, whew! Our plan was to go up the sphere in the Fuji TV bldg and ride a ferries wheel, this would have been a great place to see Tokyo from a different view point or vantage. Even if our plan didn't work out just walking around and sightseeing was worth the trip. This is a great place to bring your kids, just google Odaiba and find Palette Town, Diver City and Legoland just to name a few. It even has a beach and a replica of the Statue of Liberty! Have fun!"

Taking the Yurikamome monorail around Odaiba back and forth is worthwhile just to see how far it stretches and what it looks like. There is very interesting building Architecture to look it on Odaiba. After an initial look around then you need to decide what you want to see more of. If you want to see big malls jam backed with people, Aqua City or Diver City are a couple of likely places. Good food can be found in either place. If it is views you want then the Odaiba park is worth visiting. The Rainbow bridge is quite impressive. We visited on Aug 8 when there was fireworks shot off over the bay. 12000 fireworks in 80minutes, It was the most impressive fireworks display for volume and quality I have ever seen. If there is a fireworks display there again I would urge folks to go and view it."

They have got a wonderful beach front area, but just like at the parks you cannot have fun. Too restrictive in every aspect. The dogs have more leniency than do the persons walking along with them. There is a place called Venus Fort, modelled after one of the shopping centres in Los Vegas, that is so boring. The design is confusing and parking expensive. The food court is set up in such a way as to have you visit one time only, so there is not much effort put into making the dishes really taste good. Again, expensive. There are actually two places where you might have some fun, but after you have ridden one ferris wheel, you've ridden them all. Below the ferris wheel is a Toyota showroom that has go cart type cars for the kiddies to drive. The problem is, if you are foreign, you will probably not get to drive the cart/cars unless you should speak Japanese fluently, be at least 4' tall and have a fake driver's license. This is only issued during the week when you are probably enjoying the sites somewhere else. NOT WORTH THE HASSLE. I highly do not recommend this place. It is a waste of time and resources, You will be very disappointed"

It's very pretty huge plot of land, so you'll need to allocate a good half day in order not to feel rush. We had a peek at the Toyota showroom, where you can test drive cars. The attraction for us was to take the train back to the 'mainland' via the Rainbow bridge. If you've had enough of 'organic' Tokyo, then Odaiba could be interesting. But if you have few days, then I'd would skip it."

It is very easy to travel to - we took the subway to Shiodome station and then followed the signs to the Yurikamome monorail. There are lovely views of the bay on the trip across. We arrived at Odaibakaihinkoen station at about 11am and had an early lunch at Bills which was delicious. We then wandered through the shopping mall which has all sorts of interesting shops and then found our way to Madame Tussauds. The girls loved this - we had great fun here, it wasn't crowded at all on a Friday and we took many photos - highly recommended. After the excitement here we had an ice-cream and then stumbled upon a photo booth area which does computer generated makeup enhancement. It was all in Japanese but the girls worked it out and did a few sessions posing for photos, it was only 400y per session and great fun again. This place was somewhere downstairs from Madame Tussauds. We then walked along the deck outside to the 'statue of liberty' and took more photos of the lovely view of the bay. There are many shopping malls here with a variety of shops. We took a VERY crowded monorail back at about 5.30pm. Such a fun day out! And we didn't even get to the Miraikan science museum, Sony science centre, the onsen or the Toyota mega web.....Highly recommended for all ages!"

That being said, I imagine it has some appeal to families with kids as there are several amusements woven in with the shopping to keep the little ones occupied."

We went on a Saturday and the complex didn't open till 11am so don't get there too early. We took photo's infront of the Statue of Liberty for a bit of fun. The area is huge! There are lots of western shops for clothes shopping but no real big discounts and if your a traveller make sure you check if your buying something if the shop has a tax free flag infront of it or you might get and extra surprise at the check out. There was heaps to do with the kids. Madame Taussauds, Legoland, Joypolis and plenty of dining which was mainly Japanese style of food. If you go out side and cross the road you will find more shopping a little more like a normal shopping centre call Decks. There is also Palette Town where the big Ferris Wheel is but we didn't get that far. We ate in a huge food court over at decks. The one thing Japan does well is show you with their displays of food exactly what your meal will look like and menus are all written in English and Japanese. Overall we had a huge day and lots of fun as the main reason we went there was to visit the attractions."

Great place for families, couples and solo people alike. There's something for everyone.Only con would be that it's an obvious tourist area and those seeking for the \"feel\" of Tokyo may not like how it is not authentic Tokyo. Still though, Tokyo bay is a gorgeous site so while you may miss the authenticity of being in crowded Tokyo, you will enjoy the ample space and variety of activities that were designed for the foreign traveler."

To go up into the ball section of the building it's about a $5 ride. That's a rough estimate depending on the exchange rate. You will have to pay in Yen of course. When I went the feature at the top is Dragon Ball Z since they will have a new story coming out the hype is all about Dragon Ball Z right now. If you have just one place you want to focus on you can make a day trip of it. But if you want to see all the different shopping centers, rides and event's you will need a couple of days."

It was a lovely sunny day.There are a few different shopping centres here, we spent most of our time in Decks. I think the other one is more of an entertainment complex. We didn't get to the Museums or other places - I heard that there is also an Onsen onsite, but we didn't get to see it as we were a little tired from walking all day.Restaurants on the top floor of Decks have an amazing view of Tokyo city, there are many different styles of food to choose from. We sat on the balcony and stayed to watch the sunset - it was really beautiful. You have a great view of the Rainbow bridge as well.Catch the automatic train back to Tokyo, it was quite full when we left as it was peak travel time, but it doesn't take long (only about 15 mins)."

But we were on a clock.Note: a criticism. the flaggings on the unit say SCV-70 Whitebase, but I believe that's the designation for Gundam support vehicle/carrier. This looks more like the original RX-78-2."

Odaiba offers a mix of entertainment pleasures from reasonable shopping in Venus Fort to the Toyota Museum at Mega Web on one side of the area to the seaside resort on the other. It is worth investing half a day to see this area. Combined with a ride on the Water Bus and/or a ride on the Yurikomome driver-less train it is a nice outing. There is even an onsen public bath for those who wish to experience that particular Japanese institution.Food is very accessible and reasonable at the various malls there, so it should be easy to plan a day's outing to the area. There is a fair bit of walking needed to see all the various offerings, so dress appropriately for the day."

Came in on the underground train because it was cheaper - although I should come back one day on the driverless above ground trains because it was obvious that the views would have been breathtaking. It was a cloudy and a bit foggy on the day I went but I think it made Odaiba feel even more surreal. Bluish glass and metal everywhere for a super futuristic feel. Shopped til we dropped at the Hello Kitty store at Divers City Mall - walked away with the purchases in a giant paper shopping bag and the large adorable kitty on the side had people coming up to us all day asking where the shop was.Divers City food court's affordable meals smelled absolutely delicious from the entrance to the mall - and the food didn't disappoint either. Walked by the large Gundam statue by the food court doorway and then headed up to view and photograph the rainbow bridge and mini statue of liberty. Saw a elvis tribute group who set up - they were *very* quickly barred from performing by mall security, aw.Only saw a few stores in Aqua City Mall next to the mini statue of liberty and then it was already dark. Went outside and watched the light&music show start on the Fuji-tv building (can't miss it, it's the futuristic building with a large bronzish globe set into the top middle. Spent quite a while trying to figure out if the few offices still lit on that Sunday evening were distracted from their work by the lights - we concluded no based on the colors of ceiling tiles we saw. Took night pictures of the rainbow bridge and mini-liberty. Even saw a really gorgeous bride get pictures taken with the bridge and twinkling city lights behind - her pictures will be spectacular.Onwards to the Ferris wheel! Walked though Venus Fort Mall to get there. Went into the mall through the history garage with many shiny classic cars. Inside Venus Fort, it was done up like the Venetian of Las Vegas, blue ceilings with clouds and classic tan stone facades inside. Spent time walking through Megaweb, a car retailer with an *enormous* indoor showroom. So strange to see so many people looking at the cars because I'm used to US auto lots, where it's usually only you and the employees walking around.Decided to take the entirely 'clear' Ferris wheel capsule - slightly longer wait but worth it for the experience.Went back to Divers City for dinner. Really wanted to try the halal friendly buffet inside Aqua city but was still stuffed from lunch. Watched the Gundam show by the large Gundam statue - short cartoon show where the Gundam's head moved and lights flashed in sync with the projected scene. Note there is no where to sit in the Gundam cafe - take your food into the Diver's City food court which is right next door. Show times are projected onto the large tv screen except during the show itself when the screen is turned off and everything is projected to the left, onto the wall of the mall.All shops closed at 9pm which was so sad - I still wanted to do more shopping!--A note which apply all over Tokyo - we needed to find a nursing room in the middle of the day but the information desk workers don't always speak fluent English. Not impossible situation to work through, just FYI."

Our first full day in Tokyo was spent almost exclusively in Odaiba - a mix of jetlag and being overly keen meant we arrived before anything had opened, but once it all got started Odaiba provided an amazing start to our holiday.The National Museum of Emerging Science was our first stop - incredible technology you were allowed to try hands-on, such as virtual reality gaming and mecha robots (you can spend hours here). We then went to Diver City and saw the massive Gundam, before stopping at the Venus Fort for a drink. Next was the huge ferris wheel, which gave an awesome view of Tokyo, and Leisureland where you could easily lose several hours (and several thousand yen) with the unbelievable variety of arcade entertainment. It had table tennis against a machine (I think I lost), basketball, football and baseball (!) as well as the usual video games, grabbers and medal machines. The only downside here for tourists is that the instructions can be hard to understand on certain games.We made our way back through the Decks and had a nice Mexican late lunch at the Zest Cantina. Then it was back across Rainbow Bridge and into the heart of Tokyo again as night fell on a great day out. The best part about Odaiba is that we didn't even do half of it."

Very convenient Japanese food court in the basement of DiverCity (you can't miss the giant Gundam at the front entrance).

Don't bother paying for the Museum of Emerging Technologies unless you have kids under 10, and be prepared for the hordes of school kids on day trips. Venus Fort with its artificial sky was incredible and right now they have Xmas illuminations with synchronized lights and music. Unforgettable! We tried the 'all you can eat' buffet restaurant in Decks - not up to the standard we had elsewhere in Tokyo - but it was OK. Since it was dark about 4:30pm we also got to see the illuminated Ferris wheel and Rainbow Bridge."

We spent the morning at the Tsukiji Market then went to Odaiba in the afternoon, we were there for about half a day and that wasn't enough! Odaiba has awesome shopping centres filled with affordable high street shops unlike expensive Shinjuku! Spot the ferris wheel, mini statue of liberty and the rainbow bridge!There is a cat cafe on route from the train station to the shopping area, It looks cute but it smells like cat poop (funnily enough)!I would definitely recommend checking Odaiba out!"

Let me start off by saying there is a lot to do in Odaiba XD I think you need an entire day, maybe even two, to actually finish exploring and experiencing this place. There is just so much to see in so little time. Aqua City, Palette Town, and Decks are definitely a must see when visiting Odaiba. Unfortunately those were the only places I could finish exploring in one day. There are large shopping malls, many tasty restaurants, museums, activities, large Gundam statue, and more. Its a great place for anyone to enjoy; couples, family, friends, solo, its a place you have to go to at least once while you're in Japan. I highly recommend Lego Land and Madame Tussad's Wax Museum at Decks, and Venus Fort at Palette Town."

It is still however a nice place to spend an afternoon as there are many interesting independent shops. Daiso is also there (a shop which sells most things at fixed price of 100 Yen)). That's an interesting shop indeed. We recommend you stay till night falls (which is quite early in November 5.30pm) as Odaiba lights up and it's beautiful.

I spent two hours alone at Diver City and barely finished Venus Forts. I never made it to Decks. In addition to shopping, there is a vintage car museum on the basement level of Venus Fort called \"History Garage\" where you can see some vintage cars. There is also a ferris wheel and a huge arcade next to it that has batting cages, pool, coin dozer games, regular arcade games etc. (You can also go to Round 1 at Diver City for a more upscale experience but it might be more crowded). I'm sure the views of Tokyo Bay are breathtaking on a sunny day. I highly recommend you come here for the sites, shopping, and entertainment."

From Toyota to Onsen Theme Park, rainbow bridge, shopping and the ganman structure.Worth a day trip here with many things to do. http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2014/10/tokyo-japan-day-4-imperial-palace.html"

Seems like a lot of shopping malls, in addition to the beach. Was easy to get back to Shimbashi on the private monorail (IC cards work)."

There is lots to see and do here for families with several large and entertainment shopping complexes - Aqua City, Tokyo Decks, Diver City, Palette Town. Shopping hours are 11am-10pm and each is full of many restaurants. Aqua City has movie complex, great amusement arcade and Mamtoko Fuji Kids Caf\u00e9 and play area which is great for toddlers/pre schoolers and younger kids. Decks has Sega Joypolis which is a huge indoor amusement arcade with a rollercoaster and other rides all inside - my boys loved it here. Also Legoland, 4D Cinema and retro pinball arcade is at Decks. Diver City has the huge Gundam statue which kids will love and it looks especially good at night with lights and smoke. Palette Town has a massive ferris wheel and amusement arcade, Toyota Mega Web and Venus Fort Shopping Centre - beautiful place to visit even if its only window shopping. All have great shopping and better value than shopping in Sydney! Take the Yurikamome Line to get to Odaiba or from Asakusa you can catch a space age boat called the Himiko along the Sumida River. Odaiba is especially beautiful at night with the Rainbow Bridge and various cruise ships all beautifully lit up."

Away from the city center, once a battery (fort) to protect Tokyo (call Edo in the past), and now one of the most popular tourist attractions - the Odaiba (\u304a\u53f0\u5834, \u5fa1\u53f0\u5834) is a large man-made island in Tokyo Bay. The name Odaiba comes from the original daiba (fort, battery) that was built in 1953 to protect Edo from being attacked by sea, the primary threat being Commodore Matthew Perry's Black Ships from US. The original plan was to have 11 batteries on 6 island fortresses, but only 5 batteries were finished. Today the 6th battery became the foundation in developing the modern Odaiba and, the 3rd battery was purposely left there as a monument, which can be seen just under the Rainbow Bridge. The major development started from 1990s by Tokyo governor Shun'ichi Suzuki; he wanted to transfer this artificial island into the model of future city life. It was not very successful until late 90\u2019s when it became a tourist and recreation area. Some hotels, big shopping malls, and several big companies started moving their headquarters to Odaiba. With the improvement of transportation and the desire to have a place to leisure, the Odaiba become a popular destination in the Tokyo area. It took us about 70 minutes to reach Odaiba via a water bus from Asakusa. When we were approaching Odaiba, we passed the beautiful Rainbow Bridge and saw a man-made beach in front of the island with the Fuji TV building on the backdrop. This is a large area; we spent the whole afternoon and night but could not see them all. They have free Bay Shuttle bus stops at major locations; you need to find the small sign of the bus stops in order to take the free ride. Once we got off the Water Bus, we saw a Statue of Liberty on our right and then entered a huge Aqua City Odaiba shopping mall. There are total 4 big shopping malls in Odaiba. We only had time to see briefly 2 of them. If you love shopping, this is a paradise, and you can find almost all the famous brands here. Make sure to get the floor guide if you want to find a particular store. Be aware that goods in Japan are quite expensive. The other unique building is the Fuji TV Building \u2013 Fuji TV headquarters. It costs 550 yen to access the observatory deck housed in the sphere shaped of the building. If the weather is good, you can see as far as the Fuji Mountain and, of course, most of the Tokyo skyscrapers. We stayed quite late in order to take a night photo of the Rainbow Bridge, Fuji TV Building and the Giant Sky Wheel. Don\u2019t forget to bring your tripod if you want to take the night photos. You can go there by train, bus or water bus. We took a water bus to Odaiba and returned by train. You can check their website for more information."

Although for cgeap finds this is not the place to be. If you live cars dont miss the Toyota center where they showcase some of the cars you can only imagine. I was disappointed to find though that they don't light the bridge at night in colors as seen in pictures. We waited until night time only to see white lights.

For the business traveller wanting to take a break from prowling the halls of TOKYO BIG SIGHT, the ODIABA bayside area is a welcome respite.Get off at DAIBA train station, which is something like an interchange. You may also hop onto the free ODAIBA shuttle bus that loops the entire bay area. The buildings adjoining the interchange are all colourful malls, chocked full of shops and restaurants: namely Venus Fort, Aqua City and DiverCity.First up, VENUS FORT: It's just next to TOYOTA MEGAWEB, Japan's largest ferris wheel. The interior of Venus Fort is reminiscent of Macau's Venetian. Not a very busy mall, Venus houses a eclectic mix of mid-range small specialist boutiques, selling clothes (that look like they're made for size 0s only), shoes and luggage bags. One particular shop selling Japanese made leather shoes and hand-made leather accessories stood out. There's a small food court on the upper floor where you can have a good meal for under US$10. A mixture of Japanese, Indian, Korean and of course, the compulsory Japanese inspired western food are available.Next, AQUA CITY: One side of the building, complete with boardwalk, faces Japan's miniaturised version of the 'Statue of Liberty' and the gardens that fringe the bayside. Cat and dog lovers must not miss PET PLUS, on the ground floor, very near TOYS R US. This is a haven for your beloved pooches and felines. A stunning variety of pet products and grooming services are available, some never seen before outside of Japan, I think. Genuine Coca Cola collectibles can be bought at the brand's shop. Along the same grain, an entire floor is dedicated to vintage. From the products sold to a 1950's 'Happy Days' inspired milkshake bar. Delightful. Do also visit the TOKYO TRICK ART MUSEUM. It houses numerous pieces of art work done in 3D which will leave your mind in knots. Experience illusions guaranteed to tickle your funny bone! AND there is a DISNEY store here too! Oh joy! Pick up your fave DISNEY products without having to be at Tokyo Disneyland. Don't miss the shop where you may buy characteristic Japanese snacks as gifts for the folks back home. Tokyo Banana, of course. While there, check out LA BOHEME Italian restaurant on the 4th floor. Their huge dome shaped windows that look out to the bay will serve as a romantic backdrop as you wine and dine. You may be met with something unusual there. As he serves you your meal, make friends with MR ILIOS GARCIA: Japan's only Japanese-speaking Spanish doctor of natural medicine. I promise you, you will leave La Boheme feeling not just satisfied from your meal, but much wiser too. Go figure, folks! Lastly, DiverCity: A modern mall that houses not just the usual international brands like UNIQLO and OLD NAVY, it houses ubiquitous Japanese brands like GLICO, HELLO KITTY, MORINAGA and CALBEE. You may pick up several pieces of very reasonably priced smart casuals from OLD NAVY for the whole family. A pair of skinny jeans cost just US$10. Fans of GUNDAM will be thrilled at a 20m tall fibre glass model of one of the characters just outside the food court. Their food court is huge. Various permutations of Japanese and Korean food abound. Do note their food court etiquette: return your own tray to the stall from which you bought your meal. Prices reasonable, about US$10 per person."

Once you arrive the elevator ride to the \"big ball\" is somewhat overpriced (averages about $8 depending on ages) but does give you incredible 360 views of the city/harbor area. There is a lot of classic japanese kitsch (to scale model of the Statue of Liberty for example!) but great shopping and eating as well. Try the ramen museum on the 5th floor of the aqua building - very reasonably priced and great varieties of ramen all in one place. The only downside - as commented on by other reviewers - is that there is a lot of walking involved and taking the trains (switching etc) can take time getting there. We took the water taxi back to town which was a break from the trains and also provided beautiful views from the water level. Great way to spend a day in Tokyo. And kids will love the Joypolis - a sega inside amusement park. We parked them there for a couple of hours and went upstairs for Korean barabecue - everyone was happy!"

Some areas may be more commercialized, but it still retained a sense of Japanese authenticity and uniqueness especially since most of the areas are older with history.I thought Odaiba was not very \"Japan\". I found it very American, actually, due to the large shopping centres AND the shameless replica of the Statue of Liberty. It was also trying to be tropical and resort-y based on the music playing and the design of some buildings. I just thought it was trying too hard to be non-Japan. Having said that, I was only there for a couple of hours and mainly at the shopping centres. My brother also went to the Gundam Museum and The Science and Innovation Museum, and he found those interesting. So if you're a Gundam fan or a scientist or a resort junkie, then Odaiba is the place for you. I would've rather explored other neighbourhoods for my first visit to Tokyo."

The place is situated with a view of the 'rainbow bridge'. It has a huge mass of water made to look like sea which also makes small waves, with an island in between. The whole place was very big, calm and made us think if the whole place was really man-made because it was so very natural.Fish from the water would occasionally pop out, jump and go back in. Since it also had lots of sand, people played some ball-games, kids built castles in the sand, etc. The sunset made the whole experience even more relaxing.Small boats are lit up in different colours and probably have trips for people to look around. And the bridge is apparently lit up in rainbow colours on specific days. On the day we went, the bridge was lit up only in white.Malls around it were lit up well. 2 malls were inter connected and had reasonably good merchandise. Near the monorail station, a building and it's stairs were lit with multi-coloured lighting which changed along with the background music.At around 7.30 in the evening, cool breeze started blowing and many of us wore some jackets to keep ourselves warm.A must see place. Preferred to visit after 4pm for stay till 8pm or so. If it is for a couple looking for loneliness, visit on a weekday."

What I loved about the place is the clear demarcation of pedestrian walk strips and vehicles pathways. The place is amazing neat and well-maintained offering a nice ocean view. I had taken my wife to the Odaiba on almost three occasions and we had a great time. The Fuji TV building and the Aqua City were interesting places. Though I personally like the Aqua City better. The 13 screen multiplex offers a great time. We had visited the Ramen theme food park and tried out a variety of Ramens from all over Japan. Truly a great experience."

There\u2019s a little bit of everything for everyone here. A couple of malls, cinemas, onsen, Ferris wheel, giant gundam and a good range of eateries. Unfortunately, the Toyota Mega Web was closed for maintenance. Lunch at the Decks with a view of the Rainbow Bridge is great. For those with a thing for buildings, the Fuji TV Building is quite spectacular too.One can chose to spend a whole day or probably half a day is good to get away from the bustle of downtown Tokyo since Odaiba is quiet and spacious although I found it to be ultimately a little soulless."

The trip in the monorail is nice crossing the water, but Odaiba was a little bit disappoining, though I believe that is due to our late arrival (few things were open) and its huge dimensions. There are attractions here that I would have liked to experience, like the Oedo Onsen Monogatari or the Museum of Maritime Science. This that I did: Venus Fort, which is a mall of Venetian style, nice for some time; Toyota Mega Web is an exhibition of cars, pretty interesting; the copy of the Statue of Liberty, nice for some snapshots; Leisureland, simply without words, a huge complex of all kind of videogames and machines, so typical in Japan. I would not choose Odaiba for a first trip to Japan, but it could be a nice secondary option for further visits to Japan."

Reached Aquacity in about 1 hour and shop at Diver's City where we can take pictures of the life-size Gundam figure in front of the mall during sunset. There are many places for food (including a St Marc Cafe branch) and drinking water is free for public at the food court. Didn't managed to walk to Fort Venus due to timing, but the 2 malls are sufficient enough to spend the evening. A pleasant walk to view the Rainbow Bridge and Statue of Liberty after dark accompany by Christmas songs playing from the open air cafe is unforgettable."

We visited early one morning and the weather was pleasantly warm. Odaiba is full of little treats and provides a bit of peace and quiet from central Tokyo. There's the usual shops of course (including a West Coast Choppers branch!), the 'mini' Statue of Liberty, and so on. The Gundam statue is quite impressive, and makes for some great photos. My favourite has to be the Sega Joypolis. You can buy a ticket to cover all rides, which is what we did. At first it's a little overwhelming if you're not exactly fluent in Japanese, but it's a great experience with plenty to see and do."

Venus mall has the car showroom by Toyota and has a lot of old vintage cars. There is lots of things to do for kids including the gundam. The trickster museum is also worth a visit."

It is truly magnificent. For going to Odaiba, you have to first reach Shinbashi station (one of the major subway station in Tokyo). From there you have to catch new Yurikamome line. This railway line is not included in one day unlimited Tokyo train travel pass. You are required to purchase fresh ticket to board this train. This train is in elevated track and journey through this train is spectacular, particularly while passing through Rainbow Bridge. The New Transit Yurikamome line train is fully automated, that is there is no driver and it uses tyres within a track, rather than the steel wheels of train. The Rainbow Bridge is a suspension bridge over the Tokyo Port, located on the northernmost part of Tokyo Bay, connecting the Shibaura Wharf and the new waterfront development area, known as Odaiba, Tokyo. Odaiba is sometimes also referred to as Daiba and this becomes a little confusing, but they actually mean slightly different things. Odaiba is not a formal name, but normally refers to the whole of the artificial island in Tokyo Bay, which is joined to the main land by the famous Rainbow Bridge.There is sitting area where you can have spectacular view of waterfront, bay area and Rainbow Bridge. This area is truly picturesque and its beauty is unbelievable. The day I visited, it was clear sky and enjoyed like anything. You can spend time as much as you can. There is one replica of \u201cStatue of Liberty\u201d. \u201cAqua City\u201d shopping and entertainment complex is adjacent to this. Half a day is essential to explore the Odaiba area thoroughly. Waterfront, Tokyo Bay, Rainbow Bridge, Skyscrapers, shopping and entertainment complex make the Odaiba area is truly marvelous. I will never forget this top class waterfront area in Tokyo. People visiting Tokyo must visit Odaiba area without any fail. Odaiba observation desk, museums, art galleries, Fuji TV studios, gardens and parks, amusement parks make this area truly majestic."

The one in Palette Town is European themed on the second floor, so if feels like you're walking through small Villa in the evening. Other than that, it's a mall. The island is large, so expect to walk quite a bit. Keep an eye out for the large robot and Statue of Libery!The Fuji TV building has an observation deck, but it is closed on Mondays, the day we were there. I hear it's cool.We enjoyed Palette Town the most. Besides the mall, there is the Toyota Mega Web building and the ferris wheel. The Toyota attraction is like a large interactive showroom. There is a go-kart area for kids, in which they must assemble parts of the kart prior to riding! It was so neat and educational! That is why they are better than we are in my opinion. American kids would balk at the idea of having to 'work' before having fun. Also available is a test drive area for new Toyota models. You must have a Japanese or International Driver's License, however. The ferris wheel has climate controlled cars and offers fantastic views of the city and bay.To get to the island by rail, make your way to the Shimbashi station. From there transfer to the Yurikamone L-line, which will take you over the Rainbow Bridge and will make a couple of stops on the island. Station workers are very attentive and can help you decide where to go or get off."

The cost of the ride (single) is JPY310. The day pass costs JPY800. However, I don't think it is necessary to purchase a day pass. Try to sit in the front of the train and enjoy the spectacular view during the 15 min ride."

(You cannot choose your carriage colour!) There are only 4 clear carriages with views from under your feet, but the wait is usually 20 minutes plus. Ride is about 16 minutes with spectacular views over shipping areas and Tokyo. (I still prefer Tokyo Tower or the new Tokyo Sky Tree for better views over central Tokyo.) In the area there's lots of walking through open areas to get to more shopping centers, but there seem to be fewer people out this way, mainly because the monorail seems to be the quickest way to get there and it's all built slightly out of town. Rainbow Bridge is an attraction in its own right, with rainbow colors lighting up the bridge at night.

We're not the kind of travelers that need to check off a list of must-see attractions, and we've come to enjoy the smaller experiences and squeezing less in a day. So Odaiba wasn't part of a list, but one of our Japanese friends wanted to take us there. After busy train stations, bustling streets, and bright lights, it's a neat break in the big city routine. If you go on a sunny day, the views across the water are excellent, as is the train ride out and over the bridge. The architecture of the Fuji TV building and it's associated observation tour is pretty remarkable, and wandering through the areas were relaxed and uncrowded on a mid-week spring day. We had a picnic lunch by a sandy shore straight across from the skyline of Tokyo, before strolling the area. There's plenty to see there, but don't expect traditional Japan in any way, shape, or form. That doesn't mean it's not a terrific visit and if you have a few days in Tokyo, I would mix it into one of your days to experience more of the contrasts of a city you could explore for years and still not see it all."

The views of the city, Rainbow Bridge and the city skyline is all very impressive. Once in Odiaba, we went to Gundam Front where a 1:1 (real life size) replica of Gundam Wing stands in front of the Diver City Mall. If you are a fan of the animated show, you will appreciate the craftsmanship and detail that went into building this life size model. The mall itself is one of the best in Asia with the biggest food court I've seen in a long time. Within a short walking distance is the Science and Technology center where Osimo the Honda robot makes his appearance; agian, this center is so technologically advance and awe inspiring that mere words cannot fully capture the experience we had. I wish we could have stayed there a week. There is so much to see and do, we merely scratched the surface."

I did not have any idea what Odaiba was before I went.Actually my friends (actually co-workers) here in Japan told me to go and visit the place. Going to Odaiba is not that hard if you are in Tokyo.There are three convenient ways on getting there.First is by Yurikamome Line (which is an automated,driver-less train that stops at Odaiba Station),by Rinkai Line (stops at Tokyo Teleport Station), and last is by Tokyo Water Bus (a boat stops at Odaiba Seaside Park). I found this website (below) helpful so please check this out for details on how to get there. ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3008.html )One of the reason why I went to Odaiba was the huge Gundam Statue right infront of Tokyo Diver City Plaza. So after getting off (in my case) at Odaiba Station of Yurikamome Line,you have to walk at least 5 minutes before you see the Gundam Statue. The Odaiba Station was not the complicated so you can just refer to the signs (which is written both in Japanese,Korean,English,and I think I saw Chinese characters) of the place that you want to go. The statue of Gundam indeed was very impressive. There you can see lot of people taking pictures. There are this so called Gundam Front Tokyo besides the statue where you can buy Gundam stuffs.In Odaiba you can also see the replica of Statue of Liberty,the Fuji Television building, the Daikanransha (one of the largest Ferris Wheel in the world,Rainbow Bridge,etc.If you want to go to Odaiba just for sightseeing then I think this place is suitable. This place is also ideal for shopping and dining.I heard (although I haven't tried/seen it) that there are good restaurants (particularly Sushi restaurants) inside the Aqua City Odaiba and Diver City Plaza.Downside is,the prices here is quite high.Odaiba all in all is entertaining.Though the place is still under development but I'm sure the place will become one of Tokyo's best attraction."

Travel either by the fully automated Yurikamome Line (excellent views of the Rainbow Bridge, Tokyo Bay and Tokyo Skyline, or travel by WaterBus (also excellent views and you can also WaterBus up the SumidaGawa to Asakusa from Odaiba).For something really different - walk across the Rainbow Bridge.

Once you're there, it's all eye candy: Huge shopping malls, a Statue of Liberty replica, the life-size Gundam statue, the enormous Fuji TV building, seaside views--I also happened to catch a beautiful Christmas tree in late January. Just about everything is connected by massive bridges surrounded by lights, only making Odaiba look even more like a \"city of the future.\" It's flashy and big, but without the hustle and bustle of Shibuya or Shinjuku, and even with a bit of a romantic touch to it--just ask all the young couples present.

It is about a five minute walk to Decks from the station. We were hungry and settled for the Ocean Shores Buffet Restaurant. I am not a fan of buffets but this one was reasonable. It included a selection of western, Asian, sushi and desserts all for around \u00a51770. This is not cheap for Tokyo, but it isn't too expensive either. Decks was packed with locals and not many tourists. We went for a walk around after lunch but gave the attractions like Legoland and Joypolis a miss as they were quite expensive to visit. We also visited the Cat Cafe which was probably the weirdest experience of my life - it was \u00a512000 per person for one hour in the cafe plus one drink. We decided to forgo to entry and just had look around the cat store, peaked through windows and listened to creepy cat music.

Odaiba offers a visually spectacular experience of Tokyo Bay and the Rainbow Bridge, together with several shopping malls crammed with a wide variety of retail outlets, cafes and restaurants, together with a few hotels too. Odaiba is the site of an old Japanese fort from which the Edo forces tried in vain to repel Commander Perry's 'black ships' in the mid 19th century. Odaiba is normally reached on the Yurikamome monorail which be taken from Shimbashi station at a price of Y310. If you have time, check out also the car museum near the Toyota showroom near Venusfort."

A great place to spend a relaxed day as there are three major shopping malls, museums and the FujiTV headquarters where you can reach the 25th floor and observe the city from above. Beautiful surroundings with views of the Rainbow bridge and the replica of Statue of Liberty. If you are into science the National Museum of Emerging Science (a.k.a Miraikan) is highly recommended as you will have an interactive experience and will see the Geo-Cosmos (a huge LCD globe) and the Asimo robot. Just note that the entrance fee is 600 Yen and the museum is closed every Tuesday.As I am a huge fan of Gundam series, went there to see the giant Gundam robot in front of the DiverCity Tokyo Plaza. The robot comes to life daily at 12:00, 15:00 and 17:00. Amazing experience if you are into this kind of stuff and totally worth the visit. Try to take the Yurikamome monorail line in order to reach the area as the trip above Tokyo Bay is amazing."

That's probably the nicest thing we can say about it. Since a lot of the attractions are relatively new, and the buildings/complexes so spread apart that walking between them is not really an option, and seemingly so geared toward conspicuous consumption (yes, even for Tokyo), we were completely turned off by it. We tried to stay as long as we could, walking through the Palette Town mall and the Toyota exhibition hall, and intended to go the Museum of Emerging Technology, but we couldn't leave fast enough.If you really, really like to shop (no judgement) you may find this area enjoyable since there are several shopping centers.

We were going to have a look around, so it didn't bother us that quite a few things were closed. I can suggest the big Ferris Wheel for a great view (opens at 10.30am) and Venus Fort is well worth a look inside for the interior design.

One of the only ways to reach this area is via the expensive Yurikamone line, which is a private, driverless monorail which goes over the Rainbow Bridge.The view from here of the city is very nice, especially during the sunset.

It was about an hour or so on the boat and although the Tokyo skyline is not really spectacular from the water in the daytime, it was a really nice new boat and a very smooth ride. I get seasick standing in a pool sometimes and this was fine. Landing in Odaiba you see a short wading beach (no swimming allowed). My daughter played here for over an hour. Definitely recommend carrying extra clothing. I didn't so I ended up replacing my daughter's soaked shorts with something dry from The Gap in Aqua City shopping complex directly behind the beach. There are a few such complexes in the area...we walked to the DiverCity complex a block behind Aqua City to check out H&M and Old Navy. I know it sounds crazy but we live here in Japan and finding inexpensive and interesting clothing for kids is like finding gold. My daughter liked the interactive wall in the food court of DiverCity. It takes a steady stream of photographs and puts the pictures up on a big wall where they float around for a while. If your kid is a poser, you will be here a long time. Don't forget to check out the giant Gundam replica. The robot is cool but looking at the people worshipping it from below is kind of fun too...even if you're not a fan.

Great photo opportunities here with the bridge in the back, also great for evening shots, we even got Tokyo tower in the background. Ride the monorail, so fun and convenient."

However, given what the rest of Tokyo has to offer, we do regret spending half a day here. On 20/20 hindsight, this is what we would have done: 1) Go to Odaiba on the Sumida River Cruise. This 1-hour cruise is so much more worth it compared to the laughable World Heritage Cruise in Hiroshima. 2) See Odaiba from the train. The JR Yurikamome line circles the island. Would have saved us tonnes of time and legwork.The shopping complexes are choked full of international brands. The only special shop that caught our attention is the Cats and Dogs specialty shop in Aqua-City."

The range of shops were the same as in other parts of Tokyo. Sega World was closed for refurbishment much to the disappointment of my 12 year old and there were no postings nor announcements that this was closed until you actually get there. Sony Explorer Center was expensive and had limited things to see, same with the Miraikan Science Center. Venus Fort for dining and shopping and the Toyota Center were good places to visit. It was raining most of the day and quite cold so it was a pain to go from one area to another even on a day pass using the monorail; however, we still enjoyed the day trip and would recommend it if you have a day to spare."

My favorite items in this district included: 1.The scenic ride from the \u201cdriverless\u201d Yurikamome monorail (departed from the Shimbashi station,) so carefree, so comfortable, so convenient. With a day pass, I enjoyed many in and out as I wished. (Better go there during weekdays, not the weekends\u2026)2.The Fuji Television Building, so much fun to see the TV production related activities, and the real stage that TV stars rehearse (eg. SMAP X SMAP); taking pictures, and there were always special events for celebration on special occasions. Meet the star if you are lucky. 3.The decks, love it in the summer.4.The Venus Fort Shopping Mall, beautifully designed to remind people of Las Vegas. With indoor \u201cblue sky ceilings\u201d and \u201cRoman fountains\u201d, you can find some nice French and Italian fashions, and locally made, trendy jewelries. 5.The Rainbow Bridge.6.

The places of interest are Venus Fort, Megaweb, and the Decks. Venus Fort and Megaweb are part of \"Palette Town.\" Venus Fort is a shopping complex that (inside) looks very similar to the Venetian in Las Vegas. Theres lots of clothing stores and restaurants here.Megaweb is right next door to Venus Fort, it's a huge Toyota car showroom. Theres always something interesting to see: the newest cars, sport cars, prototypes, and even a simulation where you go into a movie theatre room to get a race car experience. It's really neat here!! Free admission too, can't go wrong.Don't forget the huge ferris wheel on your way in. It's ok, nothing spectacular but you do get a nice view of Odaiba. Your pic is taken right before you go on, and you can purchase the pic at the end if you want for like 6000yen (kinda expensive, but I thought my bf and I took a nice pic so I bought it for memories sake hehe). I forget how much it costs to ride the ferris wheel, after the first time I did I didn't have the urge to do it again on later visits.Last but not least, the Decks is outside of \"Palette Town\" but hard to miss. You see it before going into \"Palette Town\" - it's the shopping complex with the Sega logo on one side. There's a nice variety of shops in here, but the best part is walking through to the actual decks - there's a really nice view here! Really relaxing and great for some pic taking."

The giant ferris wheel wasn't so great but it gave us a 15 minute rest from the walking around and to relax a bit. Very easy to get to, one train from Shibuya Station to Tokyo Teleport. Lot of young couples and groups of teens playing at the arcadeS (more than one) and lots of families with school aged children. It's completely safe there, when you exit the Tokyo Teleport station, Palette Town is on one side of the island and Decks and Aqua City is on the other side. Start at Palette Town and walk over to Decks just before sunset for pictures and dinner so you can see Rainbow Bridge lit up in the dark."

Nearest station is Tokyo Teleport, some construction work is currently underway around the area which means they have cut off some paths so you end up walking in circles a bit!Venus Fort is a fantastic shopping centre. It is so beautifully designed and you really do feel like you are in Italy. The shops offer discount on foreign nationals but only if you present your passport. You can cross to the other side toward the Statue of Liberty using the walkthrough, although this was being renovated to we used the station as a walk through no problem. There are several restaurants above the river where we had a meal and sat outside watching tokyo get dark, the views or the skyline and rainbow bridge are breath taking. Will upload pics but you need to see for yourself, nothing compares!Also would recommend paying 900 yen to go on the big wheel for views rather than the 2000 at tokyo tower, you are presented the same views at half the price."
