Like, really religious Evangelical Christians. And there's churches everywhere. It's sort of how this entire country developed. But since the US is young, there's not really any super old churches. There are cathedrals like St Paul's in NYC and the National Cathedral in DC that are really impressive. But to understand the force of Christianity through the ages, you've got to visit Europe. And this Lateran basilica is a good place to start."

Although the original was destroyed by two fires, the church today has numerous parts of historical importance. The Baldachin, which dates to the 14th century, supposedly holds relics of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. For several hundred years, the church was the main place for the Popes to say Mass. The marble interior was the work of Francesco Borromini in the year 1650 and the golden gilt ceiling is an incredible sight to see. Giotto has left his mark on this church with a beautiful fresco. One must include this basilica, which is Rome's official cathedral today, on the list of must see places."

People praying on the steps of Maria of the stairs, throwing money down the stairs, etc. A good view of traditional culture."

Also the outside has some very neat statues out on the top of the building. Make sure you see it, but maybe save it for last so you can enjoy the other buildings before this one."

The original Basilica was built in the 4th century and was one of the first Christian churches built in Rome. Although destroyed by fire twice the Basilica more or less retains its original dimensions. All Popes were crowned here until 1870 and the palace next door was the Popes official residence until 1309 when they moved to Avignon. The imposing main entrance has bronze doors which came from Curia (the location of the first Senate or chief council of state). The inside is beautiful with its centrepiece being the very grand Papal Alter. The Gothic baldacchino is decorated with vibrant frescoes from the 14th century. Don't forget to look up at the ceiling which is a masterpiece."

The Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano is a huge edifice that reflects the immense power that the catholic church had attained in the world. There is no humility in this building. The size of the building itself and the size of the sculptures that adorn it are meant to impress and awe the believers. Gold and expensive marbles are employed to create a statement of absolute power. If you like such shows of power, you would enjoy it, it is very well done. if you are more like me, you sit there and think sad thoughts about what had happened to a faith that started from the grass roots of suffering people. I could not avoid thinking about Martin Luther who nailed to the door his famous edicts, and I felt myself the need to go out and nail to the door the well-known American saying: \"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\". if you take this visit do not skip the cloister, for 5 euro you see a beautiful early construction that still invites you to a peaceful contemplation without bamboozing your mind without shows of richness and power."

The security was quite evident during our visit and be prepared to put your personal items through an X-Ray machine before being allowed to enter the Church."

The basilica holds extrateritorail status, meaning it belongs to the Vatican.The interior is spacious and open.

My wife and I walked the distance which was a mistake on such a hot day. The church is very close to a metro station which makes arrival and departure much more efficient. As for the church itself, its historical significance and architectural beauty make it a must. They have a small gift shop tucked into an unnoticed corner where I bought a guide book that explained more about the history of the church than I can write about in a short posting. After reading that book, I can honestly say it was a privilege to have visited this magnificent and historic structure."

My fiance and I visited many beautiful places of worship in Rome/Vatican City, Barcelona, Paris, and London and this is one of my favorites. Definitely smaller than some of the more well known basilicas, like St. Peter's and Sagrada Familia in Barcelona but for some reason, this place had an even better ambiance, perhaps because there are less tourists here. Beautiful sculptures of the 12 apostles flank the great hall, do yourself a favor and check out the sculptures above each apostle as well. We visited close to closing time; less crowded and such a reverential ambiance visiting in those late afternoon/early evening hours. Well worth the visit!"

There are plenty of vendors selling scarves out side if you have forgotten one, but it is best to buy one and have it with you throughout Rome. The ceiling in this Church is quite impressive and even the kids were impressed by our visit there. There is a door of Mercy open this year and we took advantage of going through that for a special blessing. They are very strict about what you have on to go through the door here and at the Vatican. We saw them turn people away. We had one in our party that didn't have a shawl so she stayed out, one went in and then went out and gave her the shawl. she thought that she would pass the entrance, but had a sleeveless top on with a small cap sleeve. There was a group of people attending Mass while we were in there, They were from Australia and were going to World Youth Day in Poland. We meet them at the Holy Stairs which was the next place we went quite close to this one. Well worth a visit. Not too crowded even in mid July."

First, as you enter the antechamber to the church, look for the two big bronze doors that are the center doors of the church. These are the doors from the Roman Senate in the nearby Forum.Second, across the street from the church, there is a building that used to be the home of the Pope before the Vatican. Now covered with wood are 28 stairs from the palace of Pontius Pilate that Jesus is said to have walked. These stairs were brought to Rome at the behest of Constantine's Christian mother. On any given day you will find pilgrims crawling up the stairs on their knees as a sign of reverence.If for no other reasons than those mentioned above, this is a must see. Additionally, it is one of the four basilicas of Rome along with St. Paul Outside the Walls, St Peter in Chains, and St Maria Maggiore.

San Giovanni in Laterano (St. John in Lateran) is by far my favorite church anywhere!It's not as grand as St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican or as famous as Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral, but St. John Lateran is nonetheless one of the most beautiful churches of all. After all, St John in Lateran is the holiest church of Roman Catholicism - even more so than the more famous St. Peter's Basilica!Although St John in Lateran was one of the first Catholic churches, the archbasilica had a massive Baroque makeover. Behind the grand Baroque facade topped with Christ and his followers welcoming the pilgrims, the interior of the church is a fine example of late Baroque architecture. Walk through the nave lined with beautiful lively sculptures of the twelve apostles. Bask in the glory under the main altar canopy that housed the skulls of Saints Peter and Paul. Admire the beautiful medieval and Renaissance art that surrounds the Cathedra of the Bishop of Rome - AKA the Pope!For me, I enjoyed visiting this church much more than every other because it's much more peaceful and less like a Disneyland than St. Peter's Basilica. The crowd is significantly less and much more respectful because only people who knew of its significance would go out of their way to visit. Nonetheless, St. John in Lateran is right by the S. Giovanni metro station that connects directly to the Vatican stops, so it's really easy to reach! I highly recommend making a visit to St. John in Lateran not only because of its status as one of the most important churches in Christendom but also of its unparalleled Baroque beauty.---tl;dr version:1) Roman Catholicism's most important church - even more than St. Peter's Basilica!2) Grand beautiful Baroque-style church with masterpieces and relics3) Easy to reach via subway from S. Giovanni station - Highly recommend a visit!"

The interior is absolutely spectacular with so much to see and admire,that you could spend hours gazing at the beautiful statues and art work. There was a church service going on in a side chapel and the confessionals were active, so this was a living, breathing active church, but with many photo opportunities.

It is my favorite basilica/ church in the world. It is located in the Piazza San Giovanni section of Rome. It is one of the 4 major Basilicas in Rome. When you enter, you are immediately met with the stunning 20+ft marbles statues of Christ's 11 disciples and Paul. Judas Iscariot is not represented. The power of these sculptures is incredible. Each disciple is unique in the facial emotion, body positioning, and depiction of their role in the life of Christ. Helpful Hint: when taking photos of these disciple statues, take the photo of the name at the bottom of each one first, then the disciple, in order to keep them straight when you get home.There are multiple additional paintings, sculptures and artwork throughout the Basilica. I was moved with a powerful \"Pieta\" in a room along the wall to the right. This is a powerful sculpture of Mary holding her son Jesus after He was taken off the cross after His death.The outside of the church is exquisite as well. In order to get a full appreciation and/or photos, you have to walk down the sidewalk to fully get the Basilica in full view. There are statues all across the top of this Basilica as well. Helpful hint: take your time here. Walk slowly and savor this incredible Basilica. There is so much beauty to see and appreciate. .Also note one of the 4 obelisks on the side of this basilica.Restrooms available. No admission fee."

Which you might be sceptical of but if you do it you will find yourself a lot more thoughtful and respectful and a little holier by the time you reach the summit.

We went at night, in pouring rain, which added to the mystery of the place. It's on the outskirts, but it's perfectly safe. The locals are friendly. There's some sort of very loud bar/restaurant between the metro station and the basilica, which was comical. Check out my photos of the place. It was an amazing experience! There's nothing else there (just the Wall and the Basilica), so once you've had your fill of those two, get back on the metro and head back to the historical center. Piece of cake."

This may be the redheaded stepchild compared to the other major basilicas, but as such, it is worth your time to check it out. There is not quite as much majesty as St. Peter's, nor is it as grand as St. Paul's, and instead it almost feels cramped (not saying that it is small - it is not by any stretch of the imagination, only by comparison).What you will see here is an amazing collection of artwork, which is certainly not different, but the special touch here is the incredible Baroque statues of the Apostles, so it is well worth the visit for those alone."

This is a glorious church, less highly baroque than many of the other Roman churches, and as result more, to my taste, aesthetically pleasing. It felt something like Durham Cathedral compared to a oYork Minster, for those who know those churches. We enjoyed too that there were seats out in the nave such that it felt more like a live place of worship, and one was able to sit and take it in more. We arrived too late in the day to appreciate the baptistry or other places as they were closed; check the opening times as they are not the same as the basilica itself."

Funny enough, I think the main church doors blew me away the most -- it's a huge iron door that's over 20 feet tall. Standing next to it made me feel tiny in comparison.\u2028\u2028A couple things to keep in mind. It's not central to the other major sites, so it will requires a good walk (about 20-30 minutes from central Rome). I enjoyed the walk, but for those that have mobility issues, please look into buses and cabs. The added benefit of being off the center was the lack of crowds compared to the more central churches, but I did notice a few tour buses drop by around 11 or 12, right after I was done."

The statuary and grandeur of it's art are amazing and so meaningful even to a non Catholic. I found it's aura greater than St. Peter's basilica and the Vatican and understand why this was exclusively for the bishops of Rome. Go through the holy door you never know if faith will make your dreams come true as the legend promises. Again though get skip the queue tickets."

Of course I immediately head to the minuses, because it's so much fun to discover what happened to turn people off, or because they intellectualize what they think something should be like as opposed to evaluating what it is. The Eiffel Tower and Memorial to Victor Emmanual II and the Unification of Italy were neither overwhelmingly appreciated in their own time. Sometimes I imagine such people twisting themselves into amazingly awkward positions and then complaining that the sun isn't shining brightly enough in that newfound posture. So who doesn't like San Giovanni in Laterno because he couldn't find parking, or tried to get in wearing questionable garments, or had the wrong schedule? Or it doesn't look old enough? Or it isn't conveniently enough located? Or I never even heard of it?The Archbasilica di San Giovanni in Laterano is simply put, for many the single most important church in Rome, because it belongs to Rome, not the world, because it formally represents Rome and, depending on how one measures such things, can be considered the oldest ongoing major structure in Christendom of its kind.How many never notice the simple Giotto behind Saint Matthew's statue? Or decide the large latter painting behind that is the Giotto? Or never knew it was there? Or never heard of Giotto? It's Ok.Others know and care and nobody is knowledgeable about very much in the universe anyway. None of us.This is a massively impressive and important edifice which can become amazingly engaging to anyone who lets it be. I strongly urge as many as possible to do a little research, then add San Giovanni to their top whatever must see lists while in Rome. it's very easily accessible by Metro."

It is very beautiful and has lovely side altars- great colors, paintings, and a stunning ceiling and altar. I found little gifts there that I hadn't seen elsewhere, although we'd visited the Vatican 2 yrs. ago and didn't return this time. Mass times and Holy Week options were clearly posted on 3/15."

The oldest of Rome's four Papal Basilica (and possibly the oldest extant church in the world) this, together with St Peter's and St Mary Maggiore, is a church you must try to visit. [The fourth baisica, St. Paul Outside the Walls, may well be equally worth visiting but, as the name suggests, it is somewhat out of the way.]The fairly recent (18th century) fa\u00e7ade is impressive, if perhaps somewhat showy, but the interior is magnificent. It's a pity that while admission to the basilica is free, there is a charge to enter the cloisters and gardens.Unlike most attractions the basilica is very close to a Metro station (San Giovanni). It is also not far to walk from the Colosseum so if you are visiting that do try to make time for a detour to this church."

The seat of the Bishop of Rome since essentially the beginning of the Church, the Archbasilica di San Giovanni in Laterano ranks as the most important Catholic Church, even higher than St. Peter's Basilica. Beginning with the 4th Century, most Popes have been crowned there and they lived in the nearby Lateran Palace for a thousand years until the Vatican was completed. As impressive as this history is, the Basilica itself is even more impressive. With its monumental entrance doors, columns, and ceiling, the beautiful, expressive, and massive statues of the apostles lining the perimeter of the spacious Nave which itself is crowned by a gloriously decorated ceiling, and the ornate, but in its own way tasteful main altar, the Basilica is one of the most extraordinary sites of Rome. And then you've also got the beautiful Sacred Stairs, lovely mosaics in the apse, and peaceful cloister to round out a very special experience. To top it off, we had a blissful lack of crowds which allowed us to proceed at our leisure and take in the structure in a way that is impossible in St. Peter's."

It's near the San Giovanni metro stop and several bus lines stop almost right in front of the church. A bit of a security line, but worth the wait."

Alerted to its 'importance' by the soldiers and police on duty. We then discovered it had a important history, Unfortunately this was as we returning to our hotel to catch a cab to the airport. Had we not have been staying out of the main city center we would never have seen this and understood the importance. It was a shame we never had a chance to venture in side especially as other reviews seem to indicate its wonder."

            "review": "Supposed to house relics from the Last Supper and the Apostles Peter and Paul. On our visit to Rome, my friend and I took a pilgrimage to all four of the major Catholic Basilicas. We started with San Giovanni in Laterno (St. John) because it was within walking distance of our hotel. There were armed guards outside of the basilica searching visitors upon entrance, but we didn't mind the heightened security. It only took a few minutes to get through. Entrance was free as all churches in Rome are. The exterior of the basilica isn't eye-catching, but once we entered the church, I was blown away by its magnificence. I should mention I'm an atheist and could see how non-believers would view it as too much opulence and a waste of resources, but I was traveling with a Catholic friend and looked forward to the pilgrimage for the educational and historical value.Built atop the barracks of Constantine\u2019s pagan enemies and consecrated in 318 after his victory over Maxentius, San Giovanni is the oldest church in the west. The Papal Cathedra (teaching seat) was placed in its interior making it the Cathedral of the Bishop of Rome. As such, it ranks above all other churches including St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Vatican City, and is sometimes referred to as the \u201cmother of all churches\u201d. Attractions to San Giovanni include the original bronze doors of the Curia (Roman Senate House) moved here from the Roman Forum in the seventh century. The Pope visited San Giovanni just 3 days after we were there to open The Holy Door for the Jubilee Year of Mercy. For the coming Year of Mercy, Pope Francis has requested a Holy Door be designated available to people for sacred pilgrimage, so visit while you can.Another attraction is the High Altar, which is the only altar made of wood instead of stone and encloses no relics, but is believed to be the actual wooden altar upon which St. Peter celebrated Mass during his residence in Rome. Carefully preserved through the years of persecution, it was brought by Constantine to San Giovanni where it would become the principle altar of the cathedral church of Rome. Above the High Altar is the baldacchino, a Gothic structure resting on four marble columns, and said to house the preserved heads of the Apostles Peter and Paul. Another draw to San Giovanni is the 1000 pound gilded silver bas-relief of the Last Supper enshrined in cedar, said to have been part of the table used at the Last Supper. Finally, the obelisk outside of the basilica is the largest standing Egyptian Obelisk in the world. It was originally designated for Constantinople, but after Constantine died, was brought to Rome where it stands today.Most of Italy's churches include small tour guide listening stations that for 2 euro will give 2 listeners 10-15 minutes of commentary on the history and salient points of a particular site. They're worth the time and small cost to know the significance of what you're looking at. We sought them out everywhere.We visited the small gift shop in the church and purchased better quality crosses and rosaries than I saw displayed at any of the souvenir shops or vendor booths outside. You can pick up cheap rosaries outside, but for the special people in my life, I purchased rosaries from one of the major basilicas because they were more authentic.San Giovanni in Laterno is a must-see if churches are on your agenda for Rome."

They have a creepy guy who makes sure you are dressed properly, which was a little off-putting. Lots of statues inside with amazing detail. My favourite is in the photo attached. There is a lot of over-the-top/ostentatious decor inside, like a lot of the Roman churches, which depending on how you view things, can be a little off-putting. Yet at the same time is interesting to see the craftsmanship. Wide open space outside, makes the appearance walking up to the church seem more impressive, despite the street sellers outside."

Not only is it massive, it is full of Roman church history. Get the audio tour for the true experience of this place. Also, make sure you walk around to the front of this building for access. It is easy to approach from the back, thinking that is the front and that it is closed, but keep persisting until you see the massive columned front facade.Well worth it!"

There is something about it that makes it feel fresh and new. It is colossal inside. Every place you look, there is something to absorb. A highlight for me were the spectacular greater than life size statues of the Apostles that now fill the twelve niches that line the interior. Twelve papal tombs were here but were consumed by fire. Six papal tombs remain, with Pope Leo XIII buried in 1907, being the last Pope not buried in St Peters Basilica."

            "review": "The very first Christian church in Rome. This is the first and oldest Christian church in Rome and it oozes history. Much older than St Peters, it forms part of the Vatican and is the Parish church of the Pope, even though it sits well outside Vatican city. The property was given to the Bishop of Rome in the 4th century by Constantine the Great, who is commemorated by a statue at the entrance. It has been rebuilt and updated at various stages and once housed a Benedictine monastery - the cloisters of which date from the 13th century and which can still be visited. The church was built before the tradition of facing to the east was established so that this one faces to the west - very unusual. It also (allegedly) houses various relics including the heads of Saints Peter & Paul - although rumour has it that the French removed those in the 18th century. The central altar baldacchino (gilded cage) is the supposed location of those relics. Entry to the church is free but there is a charge for entry to the cloisters (free or reduced with an Omnia pass - the Omnia office is handily located in the building next to the church). The church decoration is beautiful - frescoes, gilding, statuary all of highest quality. Due to it's position as a Papal church there are some oddities such as that the central altar can only be used by the Pope and mail sent from here will go via the Vatican postal service - a Vatican mailbox is located next to the shop which sells postcards and Vatican city stamps. Outside the church another beautiful mosaic is located across the road. That dates from the 8th century and is all that remains of the first Papal palace on that site."

            "review": "Awesome I love this place. My advice to you, especially during the Jubilee of Mercy is visit this before you visit St Peter's. You will be stunned by this building but if you see it after St. Peter's you won't appreciate its size or St. Peter's San Giovanni - or the Lateran Basilica - is the head and mother church of all churches in the World. It is grand and big and thankfully not all of the Romanesque and mediaeval bits have been baroqued up. But the scale of San Pietro dwarfs this. They've opened the cloisters and while in need of much love it has a few pieces of brilliant stonework including paleochristian examples The basilica di San Clemente is ten minutes walk away, the Scalia Sancta across the road and the basilica of Santa Croce in gerusalemme ten minutes walk away. They are ALL must visits for pilgrims I think, and for different reasons. The walk from San Giovanni in Laterano to Santa Maria Maggiore along the via Americana is thirty minutes or you can get buses from Piazza San Giovanni I posted elsewhere my review of the Porta Santa at St Peter's and there is a holy door at every one of the four papal basilicas in Rome. Here, quoted from my review of the holy door, is my take on pilgrimage tips for the year of mercy: \"There is a Holy Door at each of the four papal basilicas - and you can buy models of them as souvenirs. You'll find them and any Jubilee of Mercy souvenirs much cheaper in the shops around Borgo Pio shops than in via Conciliazione, where the shops seem to add a markup to pious souvenirs and gifts. But the holy door for St John Lateran is one I have only found on sale in the Lateran.And the same goes for cafes in via Conciliazione - it's tourist packed and expensive. If you want books try the shops but also don't forget the good Libreria Leoniana in Borgo Sant Angelo parallel to Conciliazione which has good English selectionsAlso the bookshop run by the Pauline nuns on via del mascherino (running parallel to the street which runs alongside the Vatican walks towards the museum, the via do pray Angelico). Soprani's in via del Mascherino is good for cheap religious goods There is a great jubilee of mercy guide for dummies in the typical yellow cover for \u20ac1,99 which is great for first time pilgrims and is in multiple languagesThe security is much tighter than usual, for the Jubilee of mercy, and this means queues take longer than usual. I'm constantly surprised by how poorly people prepare for security - leaving jewellery and coins on and in pockets for example just slows everyone down.You will notice much tighter security in Rome - you will even notice the Army (esercito) on the streets - armed. This is nothing to be alarmed about, they've been doing Operazione Strade Sicure - Operation Safe Streets - for months now and it's as much about general crime reduction as anything else. The best thing you can do if you are visiting the major basilicas is to expect security, prepare your party by putting belts, watches and jewellery etc into bags to go quickly through screening and don't attempt to carry liquids through security. Do not buy any tickets for tours or the Vatican museums from touts on the street. They will rip you off. The best thing to do is go to the OPR office (opera romana pellegrinagi) the Vatican pilgrim office in the piazza Pio XIII - what looks like the end of via Conciliazione directly in front of at peters square itself - or even better book online using the Vatican museums website. My key tips for RomeA) prepare to walk and queue B) buy NOTHING from touts in the street, no matter how charming C) shop around for souvenirs especially religious ones there are a dozen religious shops in the Borgo Pio and more in via do Porto Angelico - the further you go from St. Peter's the cheaper it tends to beD) restaurants in the via Conciliazione are pricey tourist traps, go a few streets in \""

I wanted to visit this church because I had read about it and the square contains the oldest egyptian obelisk in Italy, and the tallest standing ancient egyptian obelisk in the world.It claims to be the mother church of the whole world, and is the main church of Rome (NOT St. Peter's over in Vatican City). It was absolutely beautiful. We went late morning on a Wednesday. You can see the old city walls outside - very cool. There were lots of peddlers hassling us on our walk up to the church. Very persistent and annoying.The church is a palace - it's gorgeous. Don't forget to look up at all the statues. As I said, we went on a Wednesday, so mass was ongoing all day. You could still go in and take non-flash photos of the other areas as long as you were respectful and quiet. Remember to wear clothes that cover your shoulders and knees as when visiting all churches in Rome...it is both respectful and REQUIRED. The mass was beautiful. I am Christian but not catholic but I do love hearing their songs. I don't understand a lot of it but I think their mass processions are beautiful. There is a bookstore at the back of the church - has souveniers too. I wish i would have purchased a crucifix but I didn't want to wait in line (boo - when in Rome, buy that crucifix! LOL). The doors at front are huge and way cool - look at the handles - they are little naked cherubs. It was real neat seeing the very old confessionals. There were lots of separate rooms (chapels) all decorated lavishly. A pope crown was in the first chapel to the left after walking in - pretty neat - kind of tucked away to the side but you can see it through the glass. The whole altar area of the church was gold, and i'm pretty sure it's real gold. very lavish. Basically all you see up there is red and gold. Okay I'm babbling - beautiful church. Don't forget to go see the holy steps across the street in San Lorenzo - but note they do shut down for a 2 hour lunch mid-day."

As you enter, it is natural to feel so very small (try to compare your size with the main door...)Fabulous paintings, carvings, statues of holy men full of splendor.But here you can also find 2-3 holy artifacts, which will thrill you, especially if you go to Rome for religion tourism;-The very first wooden statue of Saint John Baptist.-The very same steps that Jesus ascended from Pontious Pilatus mansion, for His trial.Don't miss it; this church is a museum. Art is everywhere, totally besides faith and religion.You'll be thrilled with the beauty of it."

A must if you appreaciate churches, this is the first and foremost church of the Cristianity, the church of the Pope, the first built just after Emperor Constantine the Great lifted the ban on practising Christian religion.One can find a whole lot of awe-inspiring things in a place like this, just mentioning a couple that impressed me more:- The grand beautiful mosaics in the vault of the apse, that unfortunately can't be well appreciated unless you are allowed access up to the papal throne behind the altar.- The elegant small gilded Last Supper, located on the top of the altar of Santissimo Sacramento in the south-side transetto, on the left-hand as you are in front of the main altar.There are quite a few sacred relics in this place, probably more than in any other church of the Christianity, among them the heads of Saints Peter and Paul, as well as parts of the wooden table above which the first Popes celebrated Mass (when Christians had still to hide in catacombs).The tour of the four papal basilicas is really worthwhile, they are open-air art museums as well as places of worship, like so many other smaller churches in Rome, only these probably provide clearer glimpses of how important, in any sense, the Catholic church has been, and still is, for Rome and Italy."

Most of my life I have wanted to visit Vatican City, the head quarters of the Roman Catholic Church and the home of the Pope. Get your tickets at least a day ahead of time as you can not really get tickets ahead of time\u2026 unless you are a \"dignitary\" of some sort. Then you get to use the elevators that are hidden from view from the public. Yes, I have a \"map\" of the place yet it i worthless. You just have to follow the throng, and heaven help you if you have to ask for directions. The uniformed people, not police, just point you to the crowd leaving the area of the exit and that is all the information you will get. Be willing to take this tour by yourself without a paid guide. I heard so many varied stories about the place I was standing in, I actually wondered if anyone really knew the real story that was being told. When the crowd finally got to the various eating establishments, the \"guards\" were willing to point you to the nearest open restaurant. Do not expect more than that. Okay, I sound disappointed. I am more than disappointed. I am angry that the Vatican looks upon as the unwashed, yet willing to pay their outrageous entry fee and tram our way through this place, the supposed center of Christendom and are willing to to be treated like cattle and eventually ushered out the door. As I was at the EXIt I was taking pictures of the area showing the empty line rail guiding us into the place, I was approached by a tall man dressed well in a nice suit. He asked me \"where I was from\" with an attitude that was supposed to intimidate me. I answered and when I informed him I was from California, he basically walked away without any regards to my answer. So I whipped out my press pass and as I approached him showing him my press pass, his attitude seemed to change towards civility. I asked him how many people are guides and guards, not the Swiss guards for the Pope, He answered about two thousand on a daily basis. We spoke for a few seconds and he then excused himself as he was busy overseeing the crowds leaving the entrance/ exit area, I want back to taking images. It was another very long walk back too the Red Bus area."

This is the site of the first seat of the Pope, which is actually in Rome, as opposed to where it is now in Vatican City. I loved the arch basilica for its history, but most especially for the statues within. All of the statues were baroque. My favorite one was of Michelangelo's St. Bartholomew holding his skin. (St. Bartholomew was skinned alive). While that is a gruesome thought, what made this sculpture special for me was that Michelangelo created a self-portrait on the \"skin\" that the statue was holding. The bronze Jubilee doors at this church are amazing to behold, and as a bonus, Scala Sancta is located within the same small piazza."

            "review": "San Giovanni - The Mother Church of the Roman Catholic World. Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano is one of the most important churches in the world and a wonderful place to visit in Rome. It is the official Cathedral of Rome and a place that you will certainly want to include on your itinerary if you enjoy spending time in historical churches during your travels. Opening Hours 7am to 6.30pm daily. Historically, San Giovanni was constructed by Emperor Constantine in the early 4th century upon the lands previously owned by the Laterano family. The church was officially dedicated by Pope Sylvester in 324AD, beginning its reign as the Mother Church for Roman Catholic World. Interestingly, this was the papal residency for nearly a thousand years until Pope Clement V, a Frenchman, elected to have the papal court moved to Avignon in 1309. It was also where all Popes were crowned until 1870. What to see at Basilica di San Giovanni? San Giovanni is a massive church and takes some time to explore thoroughly. The exterior facade, designed by Alessandro Galilei in 1735 is of huge proportion, featuring stacked porticos, topped with colossal figures of Christ, apostles and various saints. You'll need to step back some distance to capture all within the lens of your camera. Before you enter the cathedral, take note of the huge bronze door. Take a picture next to it to help remember its jaw-dropping size when looking over photos after your trip to Rome. Once inside San Giovanni you encounter a 70 meter long nave, lined with large wall niches. Each niche is occupied by an apostle figure, sculpted by the best of Italian Baroque sculptors during the early 18th century. Each is beautiful to look at and all are highly photogenic. The nave also features marble flooring that is Cosmatesque in style, providing elegant geometric shapes and patterns typical of the Medieval period. Look up and you see a long ceiling, delicately panelled and gilded, rounding out a most pleasant church setting. as you proceed down the nave, you will encounter a delightful 14th century baldachino, resting above the high altar. This is elegantly designed with Gothic features and lovely frescos found midway up the structure. Behind the high altar is the Papal Cathedra that remarkably beautiful to see. This area is roped off, which is actually nice as it allows you to stand before it and take unobstructed photos. The apse mosaics, Cosmatesque marble flooring, wall columns and general design of this section of San Giovanni are really nice to see. There are late 16th century porticos and facade of the North church entrance designed by Domenico Fontana that I always enjoy seeing. Have a look at the ceiling frescos here. If you step into the piazza and look up into the upper portico, there are real gems. These are more difficult to see from ground level. If you have binoculars, you're in for a treat. Beyond this North entrance, you can also see the standing 15th-century BC obelisk originally from Karnak in Egypt. To your left, you can enter the Laterano Baptistry which is part of San Giovanni but with a separate entrance. Here you will see several beautiful rooms. Further, across the piazza, you can also see the Holy Staircase of 28 steps used by Jesus just prior to to crucifixion, located in the Santa Scala building. These are all worth making time for as part of your visit to Basilica di San Giovanni. In the end, I find Basilica di San Giovanni to be a remarkable place to visit in Rome. This historically important church is not just an institutional place to visit, it is genuinely beautiful with quite a bit to see. Interestingly, it is never crowded at San Giovanni compared to the more popular places around Rome, this helps make for more peaceful and enjoyable visits."

Many people don't even know it exists, since they only know St. Peter's and the Vatican Museums, but this is also a complex of buildings and it is still a papal church. Also, it incorporates the \"Scala Sancta\", or \"sacred steps\" in the church across the street, which also houses medieval papal apartments. People have come on pilgrimage for centuries to climb the scala sancta on their knees, and the day we visited there were many people doing just that. The interior of St. John's is vast and hugely impressive; along the sides of the walls of the nave there are enormous carvings of all of the apostles, and the Stations of the Cross are carved into the walls above the figures of the apostles. Then, as the viewer continues looking up, he or she is greeted with one of the most fabulous ceilings that I have ever seen in any church in Rome, and that's saying something. The papal seal with the keys and the tiara are in the center of the ceiling, and the detail is just exceptional. Then there's the high altar. The initial colors of the church are gray and white, which makes the explosion of color on the high altar even more impressive. The high altar is really magnificent, and the relics are some of the most important in the Church. Even though it is a massive building, it feels more warm than St. Peter's, and the cloisters are not to be missed. There is no charge for the church, which is the same in all of the churches in Rome, but there is a charge for admission to the cloister. Go see it; it's worth it. The cost is 5 euro. Also, this is where you should buy any rosaries or holy medals in Rome. The prices and the quality are the best in Rome, and the rosaries will still say \"Vatican\" because it still is. There are also no lines, because people don't know about it, so you can really take your time to explore the church without thousands of people pushing you everywhere. Even though it is a massive building, it still feels like a place where there is time for quiet reflection. This was one of the churches that I had to see on my first trip to Rome, and I was much rewarded by the experience."

With a historical background dating back to 312 AD, with the defeat of the Roman Emperor Maxentius by Emperor Constantine I, and a first-class pedigree (headquarters of the Roman Church and site of the Papal Palace until St. Peter's was built), one could spend all day learning about this church. Audioguides were available from a small, sweet nun for a donation. She also gave us a very good map of Rome.  The archbasilica is packed with historical artifacts, like the tall bronze doors in the portico originally from the Roman Senate House, or the statue of Constantine found in the Diocletion bath; with relics of deep religious significance, such as the cedar table below the high altar used during the Last Supper; and also with art works of great beauty, like the larger-than-life statues of the 12 apostles, or the ornately coffered ceiling. Yet the grand proportions create an atmosphere of harmony and peace.  There is an additional fee to see the cloister, but it is worthwhile to see the artifacts displayed there, the beautiful columns, and the modern restrooms. The tomb of Pope Martin V lies in front of the high altar. At least 16 other popes are entombed there as well, but are not accessible. Every Maunday Thursday the pope delivers an address from the balcony situated on the second story of the portico."

The Cathedral church of St. John Lateran (San Giovanni Laterano) gets a 5 star review from me on the strength of its architectural, artistic, ecclesiastical and historical patrimony. I have been to Rome 4 times and missed San Giovanni Laterano the first two times, which was a mistake. The church is truly magnificent. If you are in Rome on a pilgrimage, I advise beforehand to do the Scala Sancta (across from this cathedral), then to visit here, then on to the Santa Croce in Gerusalemme which is only 10 minutes away by foot. But we never made it to Santa Croce, because I visited the Blessed Sacrament chapel in San Giovanni Laterano and ended up staying there for over two hours, and then the Holy Mass started then and I could not miss this chance to hear Mass in the Pope's own church. This adoration chapel is incredibly peaceful but note it is not accessible to tourists, unless you switch off your camera and are willing to pray in silence for some minutes (recommended). Of course it would be better to have a good look around the main part of the basilica before the chapel."

This is the first publicly tolerated church in Rome, and in Christianity, and is called 'The Mother Church'.. It is the seat cathedral/cathedral) of the Bishop of Rome - the Pope. It was the site of his residence from the dawn of public Christianity in 13 until the Papacy withdrew to Avignon, France in 1309. It started out very differently, as a cavalry barracks for the Roman Emperor Maxentius, who opposed the first 'Christian' emperor, Constantine's attempt to seize power. This land belonged to Maxentius' daughter Fausta, who Constantine later married. After coming to power, Constantine immediately disbanded this cavalry, then donated the land to the Pope, who had previously resided at the former home of Senator Pudens, at the church of St. Pudenziana (see my review). The Cathedral stands in the middle of a series of very holy and noteworthy monuments, acting as a sort of hub. The tallest free standing obelisk in the world stands right around the corner (32 meters tall, from the reign of Thutmosis III). The 4th century main Baptistery of Rome is within a few feet of the obelisk. The 4th century church of San Stefano in Rotundo is just 10 minute to the west past the hospital (keep it on your left as you walk). The Holy Stairs and Chapel of San Lorenzo is across the street. Santa Croce Basilica is a 10 minute walk to the east on Viale Carlo Felice. The Cathedralral is a five minute walk from San Giovanni subway station (line A), but beware of the traffic enroute. The exterior of the cathedral is massive and stunning, reflecting the power of the medieval Popes, temporal as well as spiritual. The doors at the west front are taken from the Curia in the forum - the ancient chambers of the Roman Senate. The interior is bright, open and airy. It is also significantly less crowded than St. Peter's. The golden ceiling adds to the splendour, as do the floor, mosaics, frescoes, different colour marbles and statues - including massive sculptures of the Twelve Apostles done by seven of the most famous 18th century sculptors. The tomb of the medieval Papcy's most powerful Pope, Innocent III is within the Cathedral. Audio and pod-based tours are available and must be taken for a true appreciation of both the historical and artistic significance of the place. A must! Enjoy!"

After having read reviews on google, I quickly realized this is a \"must see\". Note to travellers - ensure you are dressed appropriately to enter. For women - make sure your knees are covered, and you take a shawl to cover your shoulders, similar to the expectations for visiting the Vatican. We walked over in 40 degree temps one evening only to realize we had not brought shawls, fortunately we were close enough to walk back the next day and go inside.This place is larger than life, the size of the statues will take your breath away, and the intricacy of the the artwork and all the monuments literally leaves you in awe. This is without question in my top 5 for places visited when travelling, definitely go visit!!"

It is the catheral for Rome and the oldest christian church in Rome. I believe the Pope live here for over 1000 years. This is where all the official work of the church gets done; where all the Cardinals and Bishops do their work to manage the church. In the piazza there is the tallest obelisk in Rome.

And, don't miss the Bishop's chair behind the alter.Additionally, St. John Lateran is the oldest church in Rome dating to 324 AD.About halfway between the Coloseum and St. John Lateran is a small shrine -- at the intersection of Via del SS Quattro & Via deal Querceti -- in honor of the mythical Pope Joan. It is at this intersection that the mystical Papessa was through from her horse while traveling from the Vatican area to St. John Lateran. Falling from her horse caused a miscarriage."

It is the cathedral of the bishop of Rome, the Pope. We were fortunate to be in Rome at a time that the Pope would be celebrating the Feast of Corpus Christi here at the basilica. The mass took place outside on the steps of the basilica, with a one mile procession to the Basilica of Saint Mary Major following the ceremony. The procession was a candlelit walk with hymns being sung - it was an incredible experience!! I highly recommend checking the Pope's schedule if you are visiting Rome, you may get lucky as we did and have a similar opportunity.The central bronze doors of the Basilica are Roman originals from the Curia (Senate House) in the Imperial Forum.

It is so unimposing from outside you could possibly pass it if you were not interested but once through the doors you are met with an array of absolute beauty. From the incredible painted ceilings to the ever imposing statues of the saints, it is just spectacular. However, there is one little piece of paradise you could so easily miss. It will cost you 5 euro but you must go through to the garden where you will find a spectacular amount of achitectural gems and the peace, even though you are in a very busy part of the city is unbelieveable. Do not miss this gem which is so easily missed with all the other sites of Rome - also there are no silly queue's"

As you enter, you see the papal alter on your right (where only the Pope may celebrate a mass) \u2013 in fact the guide books and pamphlets will tell you that until 1929, the main papal residence was adjacent to the cathedral in the Lateran palace. The papal alter is richly decorated with the highest artistic tools and techniques of the time. The nave is decorated by marble statues of apostles leading to the alter. Whilst the ceiling is a feast for the eyes, don\u2019t forget to look underneath your feet as the floor is also decorated in style. There isn't much in terms of cafes in the immediate vicinity but the avenue opposite the cathedral (Via Merulana) and in most of the streets leading to the church, you can find plenty of cafes, restaurants and pizzarias. Within 20 to 30 minutes walk, at the top of Via Merulana, you will see the cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore (another amazing church) with good cafes and bars in its vicinity but you will pay for the prime location."

Aware how strict these sacred places are with females covering up, I took a shawl to cover up my shoulders, but that wasn't enough. I had shorts on (baring in mind it was 30 degrees) and was asked to by security to cover my legs, and after not having anything to cover with I was asked to leave! So if you would rather not be embarrassed I suggest being prepared to cover up! There are men outside selling scarves, however they're rather small. The Sistine Chapel is also as strict.

There are significant relics at this church inlcuding those from St. Peter and St. Paul. Aside from it's beauty and art works, there is also the sacred stairs which can be climed by pilgrims on their knees to reach the Sancta Sanctorum - the holiest of holies for the Catholic Church. Tradition indicates that the stairs are the very ones that Jesus climbed on his visit with Pontius Pilate. Constantine's mother, Helen brought the stairs to Rome and placed them in this special site. Climbing these stairs on our knees was a tremendously powerful spiritual and cleansing experience. Incredible!!"

We had the opportunity to tour this beautiful church with a local guide and I know that helped us understand and appreciate our visit even more. If you do not have that opportunity, do not worry, the beauty and size of this church will welcome you and delight your senses. Be sure to spend time looking at the amazing statues and spend some time gazing at the ceiling.

It is a beautiful building both outside and inside; huge, impressive and very gold!! The only downside were the crowds of course; it was extremely busy so - if you can - try to get there first thing in the morning on your own. (We took a \"beat the queue\" tour around the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel and then the Basilica starting at 8.45am but in fact the \"beat the queue\" tours only beat the queues and didn't avoid at all the crush inside which was made up of all the other \"beat the queue\" tours tangling up with each other). So if you want to visit the Sistine chapel (stunning!) I would recommend getting there early and taking the short itinerary route. Same goes for the climb right to the top. Its a lot of stairs so get there early when its cooler and less crowded. The last section is very narrow and slants over the Dome so if you are prone to claustrophobia like me, definitely head straight to do the Dome climb first thing in the morning so you can get through the last section quickly; it is a short section and you are soon out for the views."

However, do notice the beautiful mosaic floor from the 13th century and the impressive ceiling made by one of Michelangelo`s pupils. Also, go to the far end of the church where you will find a painting of Bonifacius made by Giotto in the 14th century. The painting is hidden behind a pillar so you have to be a bit insistent to find it.Outside of the church on Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano you will see the highest and oldest Egyptian obelisk in Rome. It is 47 meters high and very impressive. It was brought to Rome in the 4th century but it is of course much much older, in fact from about 1500 BC.It is a short walk from the Colloseum and I strongly suggest you do it. It is well worth the effort. Not least because the throngs of tourists in Rome have not found it. It is quiet, there is no queue at the entrance and there is no fee either."

This was probably the most impressive church we visited, right up there with St. Peter's Basilica. There is a feeling of awe as you walk in, as everything from floor to ceiling is intricately decorated. It was a little out of the way from all the other sites we were visiting, but it was well worth the walk- just south of the Colosseum."

Having grown up in Catholic schools for 12 years meant my experience was very different from my non Catholic companion. So if one can get past an entirely religious experience and focus on the incredible works of architecture and art the experience might appeal to all. This particular basilica is historically more significant to me because it originates with a decree and gift from Constantine. No other Christian church is older and that alone left me with visions of so many years of people passing through this site with the purpose of expressing their faith. No longer Catholic, I still can appreciate the history and dedication. It is well worth visiting."

This is known as Rome's Cathedral and here is where the Pope officiates in his role as bishop of Rome. It dates from 1736 and was modeled after St Peter's. The church was founded in the 4th century on land donated by emperor Constantine. Fires and earthquakes damaged the original church many times. In 1646, Pope Innocent X engaged Borromini to rebuild the church you see today. This is a pilgrimage church, one of four in Rome.

This church is very gorgeous elegant and many amazing scultures and decorations. We like this more than in fact. Really nice ones.

It is the oldest and ranks first among the four Papal Basilicas or major basilicas of Rome (having the cathedral of the Bishop of Rome), and the oldest church in the West. It claims the title of ecumenical mother church among Roman Catholics. The current archpriest is Agostino Vallini, Cardinal Vicar General for the Diocese of Rome. The President of the French Republic, currently Francois Holland, is ex officio the \"first and only honorary canon\" of the basilica, a title held by the heads of the French state since King Henry IV of France.Just check out more at triphobo.com/rome-italyThe large inscription on the fa\u00e7ade reads, Clemens XII Pont Max Anno V Christo Salvatori In Hon SS Ioan Bapt et Evang, a highly abbreviated Latin inscription meaning \"Pope Clement XII, in the fifth year of his reign, dedicated this building to Christ the Savior, in honour of Saints John the Baptist and John the Evangelist\"; this is because the basilica (as shown by its full name, which is given below) was originally dedicated to Christ the Savior, with the co-dedications to the two Saints named John only coming centuries later. As the cathedral of the Bishop of Rome, it ranks above all other churches in the Catholic Church, including St. Peter's Basilica. For that reason, unlike all other Roman Basilicas, it holds the title of Archbasilica."

The sanctuary is in the Orthodox Style - with much gilding.There are the over life sized statues, a dozen inside and 13 on the Facade. The facade was built in 1735 and is a true facade in that it does not fully extend into the church itself. Move around to the side of it and you will see what I mean.The first time I saw the front I just could not believe the size of the figures up top. They are huge. I am still trying to find out their actual size. However, if you imagine the building without the figures; I think you will find that it would make a very fine frontage for a Bank.Brian, from Perth.

I was there during a service and I reckon there were at least 20 clergy in attendance. Then there are the stairs which you must climb in silence on your knees. It's excruciating because the pace is slow as the penitent pray on each step. My knees have yet to forgive me. Especially as the elderly italian lady next to me couldn't manage on her own and asked for my assistance. She leant on me (& my poor knees took it with a whimper) then kissed my hand profusely for the assistance. What an experience!"

The facade is beautifully simple and elegant and not over stylized. It has an imposing beauty to it.It is actually built on land once owned by a family in ancient Rome - who had their villa in this location. The surrounding area still has that peaceful and secluded feel to it.There are a couple of astonishing finds inside this complex. One being the magnificent bronze doors which were taken from the original ancient forum and placed here. They are a beautiful copper green and very impressive.One of the things I was really looking forward to - is an altar within the basilica which has a bronze pediment and bronze corinthian columns. You can't miss them. They are huge. These were actually taken from the Temple of Jupiter (the most important temple of ancient rome). And where the Spanish steps lead you to - is where this enormous temple and others once stood. Visible for miles around.Believe it or not - this Bronze Altar is from the Temple of Jupiter. Even more amazing - is that the bronze was melted down after the naval battle with Anthony & Cleopatra - from the rendered down rudders of the Egyptian Navy who were defeated. And this luxurious work of ancient art was placed inside the Temple of Jupiter.In the Rennaissance - the temple of Jupiter was still in excellent condition but once again - as is so often the case. It was demolished and all the materials used in constructing the buildings that are now on that acropolis. Some designed by Michelangelo. We can but imagine what the temple complex would have looked like in its and ancient form. But there is a marble relief you can find online - showing what the temple of Jupiter looked like in its magnificence.The bronze pediment and columns from the internal altar to Jupiter where taken from the Temple and placed in the new Basilica. An act of vandalism by the over-decorators of the middle ages. This kind of theft is known as: Spolia. Where ancient art and materials are placed in newer buildings. Hoping to emulate some of the grandeur of ancient rome and usually failing.I really enjoyed the visit to this beautiful building. For a small donation - there is an entrance to an external area of gardens with a collonade on four sides. Be sure to take your seat at the bronze altar and admire it for its complexity and skill.It is free to enter this basilica. I also really enjoyed the beauty of the enormous marble columns in the portico of the basilica. They are so beautifully carved and ice cold to touch. A real achievement on a grand scale. So we have to give the later architects some credit. This building is much more beautiful than St.Peter's in my opinion. Enjoy."

From the outside, it has an expansive lawn which provides a wonderful foreground to the statues of holy men (didnt notice if there were women) on the pediment of the Basilica's impressve facade. By the way, across that lawn, is a touching monument to St Francis and his first group of followers, commemorating the holy man's visit to the Pope at the time, who is said to have recognized divine inspiration in the beggar so much so that he kissed the saints feet, to the horror of the Church elite around him. Don't miss that monument.Anyway, going to the interior of the Church, one can/should go slowly from the statue of one apostle to the next, both for its artistic value and for Christians, its religious intent and history -- each apostly very beautifully done in stone, but also with some symbol (e.g. Peter and keys, etc.) preserved through 2000 years."

We had to walk uphill from the Colosseum on via San Giovanni in Laterano to reach the church of the same name at the top of the hill. This is the cathedral of Rome and was founded in early 4th century by Emperor Constantine. It was rebuilt several times, notably in 1646 when Borromini restyled the interior. Note the Scala Sancta (Holy Staircase) which Christ is said to have climbed at his trial. Unfortunately no photos can be taken but we purchased a book on the basilica to get photos as a reminder. Not sure if postcards were available. Certainly worth the visit. Just downhill on the same street heading back towards the Colosseum is another church worth taking time to visit - San Clemente - refer to my review on this church."

That's because the massive papal basilica is not a cathedral; that is to say, not the seat of a bishop. St. John Lateran is Rome's cathedral church, and as such, houses the only true papal throne in Rome. Although extensively outfitted in the baroque, the church's bones are Roman medieval and predate the current iteration of St. Peter's by centuries. Until the 15th century, St. John Lateran and its nearby palace served as the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church and the home of the papacy. The cathedral features several monumental statues of the 12 apostles, each electric with movement; a gorgeous, Byzantine-style apse mosaic; a medieval baldacchino over the main altar, and one of the most vivid, carved polychrome ceilings in any large building anywhere. Don't miss the nearby, octagonal baptistry and the Scala Sancta -- or holy stairs -- celebrated by generations of Catholic pilgrims and reviled by Martin Luther himself. Art and history lovers should not miss St. John Lateran."

St. John Lateran is technically part of Vatican City (not Rome) and is also the true seat of the Catholic Church - it's the Archbasilica and the church above all other churches, and the Pope's home church. The seat in the apse is where the Pope must sit after he is elected.When we walked in, my breath was taken away. St. Peter's is excellent, but it is a little dark and grey. This church is awash in light and color. The statues of the apostles are amazing, and I loved the paring of the Old and New Testament scene paintings. The red, blue and gold ceilings are gorgeous.There's a beautiful baldaccino over the altar, and a side chapel (with what is said to be a piece from the table of the Last Supper) flanked by the pillars from the old Temple of Saturn. In the entryway is a statue of Constantine, and the old doors to the Roman Curia.And then there's the apse! This is a beautiful mosaic and was one of the first legal images of Christianity in Rome (not sure how much of the mosaic is the original). The basilica was built when Constantine legalized Christianity and so is the first legal church. It's been through a lot - fires, earthquakes, being looted in the fall of the Empire - but is still here, and even more beautiful, and a metaphor for the Church itself in some ways.Next door are the Holy Stairs, also worth a visit for a pilgrim."

Between the station and the church and adjacent to the old city walls is the Via Sannio market. We like these type markets, if only just to see if they have something that the others in Rome doesn't. It didn't but it was still a bit of fun to shop. My wife made some purchases. We then walked on to the church. Is is one of very few that has open space around it. At the time of our visit seating, speakers and barriers were being set up. The church is worth the visit with beautiful mosaics.

Pope Sixtus V will dig it up from the ruins of the Circus Maximus more than twelve centuries later to restore it and place it in front of the old entrance to the basilica of St. John in Lateran in place of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, formerly believed to belong to Constantine, located now in Capitol Square . At the base, Domenico Fontana, architect of Sixtus V, in charge of the road accommodation in Rome, placed on three steps a fountain topped by a statue of the holy Evangelist."

A very beautiful edifice, with glorious stained glass, magnificent pipe organ, many pieces of art work and architectural craftsmanship. You can take pictures in most areas, but some areas were \"off limits\" to flash photography. Be sure to note the many members of the Catholic faith who are remembered or buried there; each is different and quite a number will catch your eye. Hard to imagine that churches of this size were built by hard work of many hands, with none of our modern technological advancements. Take a stroll through the basilica and take in the sights and sounds of a sacred place. Worth your time I'd say!"

The interior (rebuilt over an older Basilica) is incredibly ornate and beautiful. The 17th Century ceiling is particularly fine. Non-flash photography is allowed and entry is free. You pay a small fee (5 euros I think) to look at the equally beautiful (and much older) cloister. If you go out to the other side of the great facade there is the oldest and tallest Egyptian obelisk in Rome, and the original Baptistery building (not open when we went, as far as we could see). We did fail to find the Holy Steps, owing, we said, to a misleading guidbook, which we are rather annoyed with ourselves about! The Lateran Palace itself is not open to the Public."

It is an austere and imposing edifice which invites all but without the accompanying appreciation. The statues of the Christian martyrs which line the nave are huge and frankly disquieting. Above the Papal Throne there are two enormous polished brass statues of Jesus and John (?) uncomfortably clinging to the ceiling, misplaced and far away.

This is also the place where St. Francis of Assisi came to get permission from Pope Innocent III to found the Francisicans. Innocent III is buried here. The famous liturgical composer Palestrina was Choirmaster here for 6 years in the 1500s, and it is possible to see some of the works he wrote here, although it is not a regular part of tours.

Located a bit off the main Rome attractions (15 minute walk from Colosseum) the archbasilica is the oldest church in the West. Interestingly, it has an extraterritorial status, belonging officially to Vatican rather than Italy (though quite a distance from Vatican). That means it is also much less crowded than Vatican - or actually rarely crowded at all. The basilica is huge, though still only about 2/3 the size/length of the St Peters basilica.

When a new Pope is elected he comes here to sit in the chair and officially become Pope. This is a purely ceremonial act, but it is a reminder that this is the home church of the Pope. The church is extremely old. It was the first Christian church in Rome and originally opened in about the early third century. Until St. Peter's was built this was the center of Catholicism. The interior is enormous and along the nave are wonderful huge statues of the Apostles. There is much to see here, and catholic or not this is a place of incredible history.

They fell into disrepair so the papacy relocated to the Vatican.The fa\u00e7ade is most impressive as are the massive bronze doors.

Free to enter, if you want to visit the Cloisters there is a \u20ac5 charge. There are 2 small gift shops on site as well as toilets. You need to cover your legs and bare shoulders. There are street peddlers outsides trying to sell you shawls. Site security keeps them away from the front of the Cathedral."

It is also considered the \"Mother Church\" of Catholicism. The emperor Constantine (his statue stands in the portico) gave the site to the Bishop of Rome. This is a very elaborate church, with decorations from very different times. The apse mosaic, and the beautiful Cosmati floors, are part of the oldest stage; (much) later work was by Borromini, doing the nave in grays and creams. The niches are filled with enormous statues of the apostles. The transept is a riot of color and metals. And, there's that gorgeous gold, red, and blue ceiling. There's almost too much to take everything in at one time. Note that the church is free (although I believe there is a charge for the cloister, which we did not see on this visit), and there is a dress code (knees and shoulders covered), albeit erratically enforced. Nearby is the Baptistry and the Scala Sancta."

You can reach it walking from several directions either walking southeast from the Colosseum where you will go past St Clement Basilica or south from shopping or eating on Via Nazionale."

It wears it's history with more dignity I would suggest - not feeling the need to suspend it's modest dressing rule to rake in the cash (as does the Vatican) nor to have a shopping centre (slight exaggeration) of religious rubbish every 20 yards or so like the Vatican Museums! This was the Papal Basilica for a long time before the Vatican and fortunately it is still there!"

            "review": "A Walk through Church History. An idiosyncratic choice for the number 2 attraction in Rome (are a large number of pilgrims using this site?) yet I am grateful to my fellow tripadvisor reviewers for suggesting this basilica. We included it in a self guided walking tour of this part of Rome taking in the Basilica Sante Croce di Gerusalemme, the Basilcia di San Giovanni in Laterano and the Basilica di San Clemente ending at the Colosseo.From our hotel in Via Nazionale it was about a 30 minute walk via Santa Maria Maggiore and the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II to the Church of the Holy Cross in Jersusalem. From there it is a less than 10 minute walk along the viale Carlo Felice to St John of the Lateran providing an impressive view of the Piazza di Porta San Giovanni and Alessandro Galilei's 1735 facade of the basilica. I believe this walk between St John of the Lateran and the Church of the Holy Cross was undertaken by the popes barefoot as a frequent act of penitence to worship the relics contained in the latter church. Naturally, St John of the Lateran is also easily reached via Metro Line A from the nearby station of San Giovanni.The area of the Basilica and the neighbouring Lateran Palace is highly significant for imperial Roman history as well as church history. The site was from ancient times the Domus Laterani, the home of the distinguished Plautii Laterani family of Rome. Also in this area was the Castra Nova equitum singularium (the new fort built around 193AD for the imperial cavalry). From the time of Constantine the fort was demolished for a cathedral and the Domus was soon gifted to the Bishop of Rome. The Basilica is historically significant as the official ecclesiastical seat of the Bishop of Rome (the pope) and is therefore the principal Roman church in Rome (the archbasilica). It is the prinicipal of the four papal basilicas in Rome (and therefore part of the Holy See) and the neighbouring Lateran Palace was once the main residence of the Popes for a thousand years.At the end of the Giardini di via Carlo Felice overlooking the Piazza di Porta San Giovanni is a seven metre tall bronze monument to St Francis of Assisi completed in 1927 for the 700th anniversary of the saint's death. The statue's hands are outstretched and have been placed to give a visual impression that the saint is holding up the Basilica as a reference to the tradition of Pope Innocent III's dream in 1210 of the saint doing just that which convinced the pope to support the creation of the Franciscan Order when Francis sought an audience with Innocent in Rome.Passing through the 18th century portico of the Basilica one can note an ancient statue of Constantine on the left, which apparently had been found in the ruins of the Baths of Diocletian. The nave is impressively vast dominated by 12 large early 18th century statues of the Apostles and a fine ceiling decked with papal crests. The cosmatesque paving of the nave is also justly praised. At the head of the nave, before one reaches the Transept, is the 1369 baldacchino. The baldacchino is between the nave statues of St Peter and St Paul and below it is a statue of St John the Baptist. The Transept and the Apse are richly decorated with frescoes and fine mosaics are to be seen in the apse. I regretted I did not have more information at the time to appreciate the art works here more.There is plenty to note outside of the basilica as we returned to the piazza and made are way to the right around the Lateran Palace toward the Piazza Giovanni Paolo II. I had read that the Scala Sancta (Holy Stairs) were in this area. These are said to be steps from Pilate's palace in Jerusalem which had been brought back to Rome by Constantine's mother after her pilgrimage to the Holy Land. It was not immediately obvious where these were and I first mistook the Triclinum Leoninum in the open air as the Scala Sancta. The triclinium is all that remains of the state banqueting hall of the old Lateran Palace from the time of Pope Leo III (795-816) and it contains mosaics dating from 1743 which are copies of the original 9th century decorations. The Scala Sancta are actually inside the nearby chapel but it was closed at the time of our visit.We observed the facade of the Lateran Palace from the Piazza Giovanni Paolo II but it did not appear obviously open to tourists. I understand it houses the office of the Vicariate of Rome and is the home of the Cardinal Vicar of the Diocese of Rome. In the piazza is the Lateran obelisk, one of the many impressive Egyptian obelisks dotted around Rome. It is on the sight where the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius once stood (it survived as it was once thought to have been of Constantine) before it was moved to the Capitoline Hill (a copy now being in the Campidoglio and the original in the Capitoline Museum). The obelisk dates from around 1390BC and once stood at Karnak. Constantius II brought it down the Nile to Alexandria and then to Rome in the 4th century AD where it stood in the Circus Maximus before falling into ruin and then being re-excavated and re-assembled in 1587 during the time of Pope Sixtus V when that pope destroyed the ruins of the old Lateran Palace to build the present edifice. Such monuments might only take a moment to view but their centuries of history and various locations are fascinating.On the opposite side of the piazza from the palace is the Lateran Baptistry which seems to have been on this site since at least 440AD but now seems separated from the basilica after various constructions over the centuries. It is an interesting octagonal building with many mosiacs and friezes as well as a number of side chapels. I again would have liked more information about it at the time to appreciate the building more. From here it was just a short walk down the via di San Giovanni in Laterano to the Basilica di San Clemente with the Colosseum close by, again showing how much of a walkable city Rome is."

Our concern started the moment that our tour guide mentioned something about a holy doorway (fyi - that's NOWHERE in the bible), and it just sort of went downhill from there.Honestly, the whole experience just felt paganistic (that's not a word)."

The Lateran was the ancient seat of the Popes who also lived adjacent to the original building throughout the Middle Ages. Besides the interior make note of the floor patterns. One in particular gives a 3D effect when you change your angle of viewing. Please read up on the history before heading off for a visit. The main entrance faces the towards the San Giovanni metro stop which is reached through Metro Line A. It is a leisurely stroll from the Colosseo Metro stop taking you by the 'Baptistry' built 432-440 and this directions brings you up along the west side. Make sure you go around to the front. Very impressive view! You can also reach via buses and trams. One of my favorite places while currently living in Rome!"

As we approached the Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano and saw the construction for an event out front, we were slightly disappointed, but that completely dissolved upon stepping inside.

It is very, very large - one of those places in which you marvel at the abilities of the old world architects and even builders who somehow managed to put such a massive structure together. The walls are covered with frescoes everywhere, precious artefacts of extremely high quality, depicting the lives of Christ and St. Peter.The website led us to believe that a reservation for a tour was necessary, but we did not find that to be the case at all. While a tour would certainly provide further insight, it is possibly to simply walk in and marvel at the wonders. So, there is no excuse for missing this important location, as it is just steps away from the San Giovanni Metro station."

You can visit both San Clemente and San Giovanni in the same day - they're about 10-minutes apart from each other on foot. The place: Because the Pope is also the Bishop of Rome, this church is Rome's 'official' cathedral (this is because this church is the seat of the Bishop's residence). San Giovanni very much resembles St. Peter's basilica. Now, what did I think? WOW! What a beautiful (and HUGE) church! Architecturally and visually stunning - those are the best words I can use to describe it. If you love art, history and architecture, or you are simply devout, then this is a must-see church. I spent about two hours taking photos here, and I probably could have stayed longer because it is that impressive. For the first few minutes after I entered the church, I stood there with my mouth hanging open because I was in awe of the magnificence that was before me. I mean seriously, it's an architectural feat. Price point: Free entry.One of the things that I enjoyed about visiting this church was its size - you can walk freely and at your leisure without anyone invading your space, so it's a nice break from the madness of Centro Storico."

It is the Cathedral of the Bishop of Rome (The Pope) but it is not as crowded with visitors as the Vatican is. Its design is outstanding and the marble work on the floors is magnificent along with the whole design of the cathedral. Inside it is not as dark and heavy as many ancient cathedrals and with the light streaming in, it highlights the statues in the niches in the walls. I easily spent an hour here enjoying the cathedral.While the Vatican is far better known and has more religious and historical heritage, this cathedral would rank number 2 to see."

San Giovanni Laterano is a bit off the beaten path (all of the major basilicas are on the fringes of the city), but it's well worth a visit. Honestly, while it's smaller than St. Peter's, in some ways it's even more visually arresting. Polychrome marble everywhere you look--it's both vast and a bit claustrophobic in its ornateness. It's a lovely, quiet place to sit and take a break and let it soak in. It also has a museum (that I didn't get to see) and a wonderfully kitschy gift shop."

There is no fee for the admission. If you enter from the right side like I did, the first thing you will see it the big altar. The central nave is very wide and there are two smaller naves on its side, which is typical of the old churches architecture. There are tombs of popes along two smaller naves and 10 feet statues of important saints along the main one. There are chapels, frescoes, paintings and other statues of religious subject on its side. Each one of these masterpieces could be one of the main pieces of art in a smaller museum. The ceiling is decorated in a complex way with carved elements and gilded. Light comes from the above windows. I got there around 4:40 pm and there were some people gathering, then a cardinal arrived and at 5 pm he started to celebrate a mass. You should spend at least an hour here."

As the Basilica of the city of Rome, the Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano is magnificent and is within walking distance from the stairs which Jesus climbed to have his ultimate fate determined (devout Catholics climb these stairs on their knees - praying all the way).Back to the Basilica - Rome's Cathedral, is either a truly wonderful location for quiet and peaceful contemplation and prayer or a place to simply find inspiration. As the Basilica is a little outside the 'normal' tourist zone, it does not attract the same volume of visitors as St.Peter's Basilica and this fact alone ensures that a visit is not generally spoiled by having to wait in a queue to gain access.Early morning visits are, in my opinion, nonetheless best (especially if you want to also walk around the Basilica's garden without Rome's searing summer heat!). As a continually returning visitor to Rome (having previously been a Roman resident for a few years), I always ensure that a visit to San Giovanni, is on my list of 'must do's' during each stay.I hope you enjoy your visit!!"

I urge everyone to read up on the history and art associated with this Basilica. It is after all THE mother church of Roman Catholicism, not the more visited Basilica of St. Peter. San Giovanni doesn't have the distracting crowds of St. Peter's Basilica, and there is plenty to see. Equipped with some knowledge about the place, I can spend a good two hours there every time I visit it.  The Basilica one sees today is a great example of different reconstructions, modifications, and additions, rather than a building reflection one style of architectural design. It is a grand lesson in Roman art/architecture and possibly some of Morromini's great designs for a building of this size. Not to be missed are the Baptistry and Cloister. Take your time but go prepared ahead of time so you know a little about what you are seeing. The more you know, them more you will see and understand and appreciate."

We accidentally found a small souvenir shop inside the church (towards the middle) and noticed that the souvenirs were cheaper (even half the price) here from the other shops near the vatican. They have a large selection and as I said, half the price. The lady and the gentlemen at the souvenir shop were really helpful.

It was the HQ of the Roman Catholic Church before St Peter's was built at the Vatican. The metro station is close by and you walk just outside the old city wall, which is why the original church was built here back in the day when Christianity was not widely accepted. The approach is impressive with statuary of early saints on the roof top, then I was astounded by the cavernous quality of the interior. It really must be one of the biggest churches in Europe. Well worth the trip out on the metro and you may be able to also visit the Lateran Palace next door (predecessor of the Vatican)."

When I was in the security line to enter St. Peter's Basilica earlier in the morning, I was chatting with a nice Canadian man who suggested that I visit this basilica if time allowed. He mentioned that this was the true papal church in Rome, and that the skulls of St. Peter and St. Paul were actually within the memorials in the church. So, I added it to my list. The bit of history is what I found to be the most amazing, but the church inside is gorgeous. There are many statues and vignettes within the church, and a lot of small chapels inside. The tiling on the floors is even beautiful. Definitely worth the visit to have a look around, or even sit in on a mass if you are there at the right time. It is about a 15 minute walk from the Colosseum, and a bit off the beaten path. You could also easily take the metro from Colosseo to San Giovanni (I think?), and it's only a few minute walk in the other direction from there. If you can, though, I would walk from the Colosseum, as it's mostly back a little side street that is very charming and a nice quiet walk."

Very bright interior during daylight so you can see the treasures.Most large churches, like St Peter's are dark.This was the Pope's church before St Peter's and the area surrounding the church still seems to belong to the Vatican. A lot of work and money went into this church over the centuries.No lines and few people.High doors taken from the Roman Forum outside. Golden columns from a Roman Temple to the left of the white chair for the Pope at the far end. Endless large marble statues what were all worth looking at for a while.There are chairs and benches to sit on. Useful when old like us or when you wish to contemplate the beauty around you.I think there is a WC in the Sanctuary but that costs money. It is not worth paying to go in otherwise. We did. If interested, it is on the left side at the far end from the main entrance.We went in 3 times during a month in Rome. Great each time. Bus #117 starts across the street from the Baptistry.That route takes you past the Forum and close to the Spanish Steps among other tourist sites.There is a Baptistry around the back. I believe it was the template or all other baptistries. We did not go in. Closed.The is an Egyptian Obelisk in front of the baptistry. I believe it is the highest in Rome and is covered with Egyptian hieroglyphics. Worth looking at.Scala Santa is near the front and to the left if facing AWAY from the church. It is small, unmarked,it seemed, and worth going in even if you don't believe in a Christian God. It contains the stairs Christ is said to walk up before he was sentenced to die and is a major pilgrimage stop."

You will find a grand church with fewer visitors and a much more peaceful experience in a palatial atmosphere."

I wanted to visit the \"Archbasilica\" for this reason alone. It's almost as stunning as St. Peter's Basilica. There's a lot of intricate detail from the ceiling to the floor. The ceiling's panels are gilded in gold. The floor has this decorative inlay on marble that was done beautifully in the Cosmati style. There are also beautiful life-size sculptures of the apostles lining the nave. There are just so many different parts of this church that are interesting. You just have to see it to understand why it is ranked in the top 5 of all attractions in Rome."

We actually visited it twice in 5 days and the second time we visited the holy stairs across the road which also has a terrific history and is renovating the staircase which was bought from Jerusalem many years ago. Climbing those stairs is only allowed on your knees and a prayer is to be said on each step. There is another staircase for those who want to see the piece of Christ's cross upstairs but can't go up on their knees.Well worth a visit."

The mass finished around 18:45 and I wanted to stay quietly and pray for 5 more minutes. This turned out to be impossible, because the guards started to throw people out of the church (very impolitely by the way), including those who were in the middle of a prayer. I understand that the closing time is 18:30, but in this case the last mass should be early enough, that pilgrims can stay and pray in the church for at least a few minutes. This is what churches are for, as far as I know... This experience made me very bitter."

The decorations and altar area are worthy of a papal building. The small side chapels are ornate and worthy of spending some time viewing. For an additional charge (5 euro) one can enter the cloister area with a museum holding some interesting artifacts, but I would question its value to the average tourist. If you want to get the most from your visit get and audio guide to let you understand the history of the church. The audio guide is compartmentalized in that it allows you to listen to the part about the church, but the cloister component is only activated once the additional fee is paid. There are other components on the audio that are not accessible which was frustrating.The church requires people to have their shoulders covered and to be wearing near knee length clothing. If you do not comply then you will be denied entry. Shawl sellers do a good trade outside the venue as a result (be prepared to pay about 5 euro). This policy is enforced at most churches we visited.The site is easily accessed from the metro stop at San Giovanni.Time to allow would be about an hour for just the church, but a bit more if you want to include the cloister."

It was interesting to find out that there was a supposed piece of the table from the last supper located above the sacramental altar. I was also surprised to find out that this church is the seat of the bishop of Rome and therefore of the pope. So when the pope gives mass he mostly gives it here. I would not have expected that, as we had just come from the more popular St. Peter's Basilica and I would have expected that instead.We visited in January and it was not very crowded.

And then there was a young priest who lowered himself to one knee in order to speak kindly, face-to-face with a toddler who seemed dubious about the darkened surroundings.

The party area is closer to the front of the street, though, and we were staying towards the middle, so be mindful of that if you're staying in that area and wish to get a good night's sleep.

It is not the biggest church, nor is it the most gaudy, but it was the FIRST church built around 312 AD. It has gone through several remodels over the years, but each attempted to keep the church true to its original heritage.It is replete with historical significance being commissioned by Constantine shortly after Christianity was allowed to be practiced in the empire.It has many fantastic archaeological features as well and was first seat of the Pope. Not being catholic myself, it was a fascinating journey through the beginning of the catholic faith during the reign of Constantine. If you love history (and some cool art) this is a must see place. It actually has a ton of character that makes it much more interesting than many other churches in Rome."

You need to leave an ID, and donations are suggested. Do a little research on the history of the basilica on-line and you will not be dissapointed. If you have time I recommend you pay the few euros to do the self guided tour of the cloister. We did not have time, but wish we did.

The cathedral was dedicated to the Savior on November 9, 318. Pope Sergius III added John the Baptist to the basilica\u2019s dedication in the 10th century. Pope Lucius II added John the Evangelist in the 12th century.Pope Innocent X decided in 1646 to restore the cathedral and assigned Francesco Borromini to repair the church. He put 12 niches, which today contain large statues of the Apostles that were made by sculptors in the beginning of 1700. The main fa\u00e7ade is the one facing east and was the work of the Florentine Alessandro Galilei and is dated 1732-1735. It was inspired by the work of Palladio. It is the seat of the bishop\u2019s residence and considered the Cathedral of Rome, since the Pope is also the bishop of Rome. The church has one nave flanked by two aisles and ends in a semi-circular apse to the west. There is a 14th century Gothic ciborium created by Giovanni di Stefano. Under this ciborium (at the end of the central aisle, in the transept) is the papal altar where only the Pope can give mass.There is an apse bowl which has a mosaic with God appearing on the upper part. Below is the Virgin Mary. To her left are the figures of Paul and Peter and St. Francis on a small scale. To her right are St. John the Baptist, St. Andrew, St. John the Evangelist and St. Anthony of Padua on a small scale."

The Scala Sancta (the Holy Stairs) are the wooden steps where Jesus Christ walked on his way to be sentenced to death by execution orded by Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem.

Guided tours at 9:00-10:00-11:00-12:00, and last just under an hour. A small cafe/bar is nearby if you need to sit while waiting for the next tour. There is a long, shallow flight of stairs (no elevator). You can see a complete set of a knight's armor (they were very short back then), Mussolini's signature, miniature cannon.

There are some relics located here - including pieces of the table from the last supper and some bones of some saint - can't recall but remember reading in the Rick Steves guide.The humongous main doors to the basilica are worth a trip in themselves.

It was lovely to sit in the church and take it all in after what was a busy last day in Italy. And as another posted commented, the church is in very good condition."

About a 10-15minute walk from the Coliseum is this beautiful Basilica, as the title suggests, i would defiantly put a day aside to visit, hands down one of the best attractions on my trip!After walking around the various Chapels, we strolled across the road to the Scala Santa and Sancta Sanctorum, and seeing the 16th century crucifix was a highlight!Finally again a short little walk away is the Baptistery, a must must visit, (personally my favourite part of the whole day), beautiful artwork tells wonderful stories! (see picture)I'd recommend getting the audio guide sometimes they're a bit hit and miss but this was a iPod with earphones and was by far the best audio-guide i experienced in Rome!No wonder The Catholic Church call it \"The Mother of All Churches\"...."

Borromini was involved with one of the 17th C restructurings of the building, so you'll find his cherub motif tucked into spandrels in the side aisles, but this wasn't the best fit for his talents. The late medieval ciborium is interesting, there's a badly preserved bit of fresco by Giotto, and the 18th C statues of the apostles are impressive, but there are no real first-rate works of art here."

Enhance the experience by reading up some history on it before you go in so you could appreciate the significance and symbolism of every aspect. Also, across the street is the Sancta Sanctorum, which used to be the pope's personal altar/church. I went into it with a class, but I'm not sure if there's a way for the public to get in. It too is beautiful. You'll also see the Scala sancta which are said to be the stairs that Christ walked up in order to appear before Pontius Pilate before his crucifixion. It is believed that if you climb these steps on your knees, all your sins will be forgiven. Regardless, just seeing the amazing churches and steps and their significance in history is well worth the visit!Only downside is that it's quite a trek to get there.

Huge basilica, the mixture of styles, enormous number of details and decorative elements. Beautiful cloister (upon extra fee). Huge, spacious interior, sometimes a little crowdy, easily accessible (metro, station San Giovanni or some buses (e.g. small electric bus No. 117 - it stops close to Colosseum, a walk from there takes 15 minutes, there is St Clemente Basilica on the way as extra bonus ;-)A must see - also the sourrounding is veru interesting: the Holy Stairs Chapel across the square, the Roman walls and Egyptioan obelisk."

It was only after visiting that I read some of the history of the cathedral. To fully appreciate all I was seeing, I should have read about it prior to my visit. It was only later that I found out that the massive bronze doors were once located in the Senate in the Roman Forum. This church certainly merits a visit, but if possible, do it at a time when a religious service is not being conducted so that you can see all that it has to offer without distracting anyone. I walked from the Coliseum and it took about 15-20 minutes."

It is massive, yet has an intimate feel. I enjoyed these major churches just as much or more than the Vatican. I also found out that one can get a plenary dispensation if you visit all four churches in the year 2015"

However, the pope lived at the Lateran Palace at the church of San Giovanni in Laterano (St. John's at the Wall) formany centuries. It is a spectacular church and the cathedral ofthe diocese of Rome. It has most ancient baptistry in all of Christianity, which is located in a sperate medieval structure behind the cathedral. The mosaic above the altar is magnificent. The church also has a beautiful cloiser, which is open to the public for a small admission. And, there are publicrestrooms available in th cathedral and cloister area, which is a very rare and precious gift to tourists. This church is also the burial site of Pope Leo XIII, the social justice pope, and the greatRenaissance architect Berninni. The central doors of this cathedral are the actual doors to the ancient Roman Senate.How's that for history?"

The audio is free, they really dont tell you that they are free, but be sure to pick up a set when you enter. You can give a small donation. Be sure to go next door to see and even experience the Sacred Steps that pilgrims climb on their knees. These steps were brought by St. Helen (Constantine's mother) from Pontius Pilate palace-- the ones Jesus walked up. It is quite humbling."

            "review": "Notes on visiting Rome\u2019s cathedral (and the Scala Sancta!).. Founded in the early 4th century by Emperor Constantine, San Giovanni in Laterano is considered one of the oldest churches in Christianity and rivals only St. Peters for historical bragging rights in Rome. The church also functions as the official ecclesiastical seat of the Bishop of the city, who in this unique case happens to also be the Pope. I visited the area with a small group through Context travel. We started at the Scala Sancta (Holy Stairs) which according to the Christian tradition are the steps that Jesus climbed on his way to trial. Located opposite the Basilica in a building that used to house the Lateran Palace, the stairs themselves consist of 28 wooden steps that you can ascend (on your knees) if desired. There is a small museum on top that contains older Christian relics. A tour of the Basilica proper followed. Like many historic churches there are seemingly endless levels of appreciation for the statues, artifacts, and paintings inside. In this case highlights included a fresco of Boniface VIII (possibly by Giotto), the Papal Altar, the tomb of Innocent III, and the impressive fa\u00e7ade by Alessandro Galilei. We finished with a tour of the Lateran Baptistry (for years the only one in Rome) with its associated art works. Our guide did an excellent job of explaining the infinite intricacies of the church and providing context with present day history and religion. There was an audio guide available as well for those who do not have the means/desire to join a guided tour.In summary, if you visit one church in Rome I would suggest St. Peters. If you visit two please include this one. An overall worthwhile journey."

The Basilica of St John Lateran is known as the Cathedral of Rome, and is one of my favourite places in Rome, but you do need to read up a bit about it to get the best out of a visit. Taking along a decent guide book is well worth it.First, there is a huge Roman statue of Constantine, outside the basilica, in the porch. Secondly, do not miss a close look at the huge doors before you enter. If they look old, its because they are- they were the original doors to the Curia in the Forum. Inside, pay particular attention to the beautiful ceiling, and statues of the apostles by Borromini, lining both sides of the nave. The frescoes and decorations in the centre of the Basilica are hugely impressive, and as if that was not enough there is one of Rome's loveliest cloisters to walk around too.Outside in the large piazza,you can walk around to the historic Baptistery, originally dating from the time of Constantine. Unfortunately it was closed when I was there. It takes about 30-40 minutes to walk to the Basilica from the Colloseum. Down Via S Giovanni in Laterano. There are a number of cafes along here for a coffee and snack. You might want to visit the church of San Clemente whilst you are around this area, the famous church with its underground excavations. You will pass it as you walk along the Via S Giovanni, but its easy to miss it."

If you get a chance, walk down Viale Carlo Felice towards the church. It is a tree lined street that leads you straight to the front of the church. At first, you can tell the church is large, but it is incredibly deceiving. Everything from the statues, to the pillars, to the arches are all in perfect proportion so that it is difficult to judge how far away you are from the entrance. Only when you get very close do you realize how immense the facade is. The inside also has stunning proportions, with statues about 15 feet tall lining the view towards the altar. The details are amazing and every corner has some intricate design. Definitely worth visiting if you are in Rome."

Many people, especially non-Catholics, do not realize that this is the \"official\" home parish of the Bishop of Rome - in other words, the Pope. Whenever the Pope officiates in his capacity as the Bishop of the Rome diocese, it is at St. John Lateran - not St. Peter's. What I appreciate most about this enormous church is the light - most of the churches in Rome tend to be pretty dark inside, but not St. John's. The openness and light allow one to appreciate the marvelous gold leaf and art work on the ceiling. Enormous statues line the church. It has beautiful side altars and the organ is beautiful to behold - can't imagine what it must sound like. Check out the web site for St. John Lateran for yourself - words can't do it justice. It is located a few blocks south of the Colosseum (an easy walk) and there is a subway stop (Redline) for St. John's. You can even catch a bus across the street from the Church and go to the Catacombs."

Fantastic treasures of paintings and even old confession boxes and can be cool as a respite from the rome heat but going in late October, early November is a much better time to explore the city as it is like a cauldron in the summer months. Metro is around 3 Euros for a day journey to the Vaticano area but be particularly careful around the Trevi Fountain area in particular as we witnessed the police apprehending a guy with a big fat wallet he has stolen from some unfortunate tourist. Angelo's restaurant at the Piazza Navona is good and he is particularly welcoming and will send free champagne to your table courtesy of his charm. Do stay in the laterano area if you want to experience a real taste of an Italian neighourhood and not too many tourists. In fact, I reckon that we were the only ones there.

Having said that, there are a lot of amazing churches in Rome, full of renaissance masterpieces and melted down Aztec gold. This is a great example. The most notable feature though are the great bronze doors taken from the Imperial Roman Senate which are still used as the main entrance to the church. It is quite something thinking you have just walked through the same door that Caesar, Nero and Hadrian walked through all those years ago."

Often overlooked by tourists, it's a hugely interesting edifice having included the residence of the Popes prior to their exile to Avignon. This is the Cathedral of Rome, where the Pope performs his day-job as Bishop of Rome.The old Papal Palace contains the steps from Pilate's house in Jerusalem, a pilgrimage site. Another Christian \"relic\" of dubious provenance, of which there are thousands in Rome. This one claims to have the bloodstains of Jesus embedded in the steps.The cathedral is full of intricate sculpture, excellent marble floor-work and Papal tombs, and contains a High Altar at which only the Pope can perform.Walking from the Forum, you will arrive at the entrance on the northern Nave. Don't forget to go round the front of the cathedral and see the facade! The first thing you'll see is the obelisk of Thutmoses III, the oldest in Rome dating from 15thC BCE. Pinched from Egypt by Constantine, it was originally in the Circus Maximus.A short walk away from the eastern facade, in the direction of the Metro station, is a part of the Aurelian wall containing the Porta San Giovanni.Entrance is free, apart from the cloister area which currently costs 3 Euros. Remember - as for most Italian churches - to take a shawl to cover your shoulders and have your knees covered too. Or you won't get in. I cart around a pair of tracksuit trousers and a T-shirt in my day-pack specifically for this prpose!"

We learned that the pope must actually sit in the \"cathedra\" chair in this magnificent church sometime during his first year after being elected in order to be formally named The Pope. After spending several hours inside marveling at its beauty, we walked across the street to the Scala Santa (Holy Stairs). We saw many people on their knees, climbing the main stairway while engaged in their prayers. We took another stairway to the second floor, saw the chapels, and read the history. Beautiful.

Residence of the Pope from the 4th century (until 1309) San Giovanni is also an icon of the Catholic history. The fact of being the most ancient church in the world is another reason to visit it. The buiding was destroyed and rebuilt serveral times.It is a huge and amazing building but much less crowdy than Sain Peter's Basilica. From the main altar to the right side you will see a huge church pipe organ made in 1598.Please keep the Vatican dress code here although controls can be a little bit relaxed.You can access here by metro (metro station San Giovanni of the Red Line is only 100 mts from the Church) or bus.

We used it for a \"self-tour\" and had it as a souvenir to take with us. The Holy Staircase is in a building across the street... we felt also very worth the time to visit and be inspired."

The interior is lovely to see (and, it is a free attraction--a rather rare thing in Rome). For me the highlight was seeing the doors that were moved from the Curia (Roman Senate) to the church in the 300s. I really felt the symbolism of that--that the Romans took the doors off of what had once been the most important institution to them (the symbol of their \"free\" government) and moved them to the church (the institution destined to become the most important institution in the region for 1000 years). Very fortuitous. At any rate, I enjoyed the church and the doors."

The Laterani family was martyred and the Palace stolen because of their faith and how ironic that it should then become the greatest of churches. The statues of the Apostles are some of the greatest art in the world and unlike Florence, all free to see! My husband counted the dime sized triangular tiles in the mosaic floor (The same pattern found in The Holy Cross in Jerusalem Church which was also a palace) and calculated that one circle alone contained over 2,400 tiles each cut and laid by hand. This is mind boggling when you realize that there are thousands of these circles in the entire church. The Table of the Last Supper is enshrined here as well as the relics of both Sts. Peter and Paul."

The entrance door in the left there is a bronze madonna holding a baby that lots of people touch and even get very emotional - you will notice that the foot of the child and one of the fingers of the madonna is shiny and not green like the rest. There is also the Scala Santa, supposedly the real stairs from the house of Pilate in Jerusalem used by Christ when he was condemn to crucifixion. Outside there is the oldest bapstistery and the oldest obelisk of Rome and other ruins that I'm not very sure what they represent. These collection of buildings are also part of the Vatican (despite the fact they are not within the VAtican grounds). San Giovanni is not far from the Colliseum and in the way it's worth stopping to see the church of S. Clemente."

The size of this basilica is not as big as St. Peter but that does not make this basilica least important as it is the cathedral church of the Diocese of Rome, and the official seat of the Pope, where he acts as the bishop of Rome and the head church in the world. The highlights are: i) the two-storied portico that makes up the facade of the basilica and the large statues of Christ & the saints on top of the fa\u00e7ade dating from the 18th century;ii) the central bronze doors from the Curia (Senate House) in the Imperial Forum;iii) the Roman statue of Constantine the Great (at the left end of the portico) which was found in the ruins of the Bath of Diocletian;iv) the Cosmatesque pavement in the nave dates from the 14th century;v) the statues in the nave depict Apostles and Evangelists. Closed doors painted on the wall behind the statues represent gateways to Heavenly Jerusalem. Above the statues are relief panels with Old Testament scenes on the left and related scenes from the New Testament on the right, all these dating from the 17th century;vi) the cloisters date from early 13th century;vii) the mosaic in the apse dates from 800, the year Charlemagne was crowned in Rome. It depicts Christ with the Apostles in the center, Christ with Constantine and Pope Sylvester I on the left and St Peter, Pope Leo III and Charlemagne on the right. Pope Leo II has a square nimbus, showing that he was alive when it was made.viii) the Scala Sancta (Holy Stairs) nearby and the baptistery (the oldest in Christendom). Access to the basilica is free but a minimum admission fee of \u20ac2 is applicable for access to the cloisters. Personally, I love to visit this basilica more than the St. Peter because there are fewer crowds here compared to St. Peter and I could take my time to slowly admire the whole basilica, the cloisters and the Scala Sancta as well as the baptistery nearby.  On a side note, there are two shops in the basilica, I bought a lot of souvenirs from one of the shops (at the side in line with the back door) in this basilica instead of those shops scatter around the city and the Vatican (I think the quality is about the same but price is at least cheaper than St. Peter, just make sure you inspect every item as some stocks may not be very new) as my small contribution to support this basilica. I allocated a full day to visit 4 basilicas (except the St. Peter), the Trevi fountain, the Spanish Steps and end the day at Piazza del Popolo. Send message to me if you are interested to know the details (provided that if you can walk a bit)!"

Inside is a sight to behold and take time to take it all in. Many so called ' relics' are kept here. Near by are the Santa Scala (Sacred Steps) and the Baptistry (oldest in the world). Although the Basilica is open ' all day' the Santa Scala and the Baptistry are closed for siesta from 1230 until 1530. Another Basilica is Santa Maria in Maggiore which is about 15 minutes walk straight up Via Merulana from Piazza San Giovanni.The other Basilica's are St Peter's which needs no introduction and St Paul's Outside the Wall's.

The 18-th century facade is impressive, with large statues of Christ and the apostles at the summit. The tall bronze green doors were moved to this church from Rome's ancient Senate building in the 1650s to remind everyone that the church was Europe's lawmaker. The church is huge and impressive. No wonder, as it's where the pope occasionally holds mass. The mosaic half dome over the apse glistens, and the bishop's chair beneath is where newly-elected popes must sit before the can officially become pope. (Methinks the ceremony is likely timed so that the shaft of light entering the window above left falls squarely on the bishop's chair.)It's a good idea to combine a visit to this church with a visit to the Holy Staircase, which is right across the street. It's also not far from San Clemente, another fascinating religious site."

            "review": "One of the top church visit experiences available in Rome. Having visited Rome on numerous occasions, we consider San Giovanni in Laterano a top two or three church visit experience in the city of Rome. Combined with the Scala Santa attraction, just across the street, this makes a 'must-see' visit, even on the shortest of trips to Rome. Only a visit to the Vatican and St. Peters could be considered a higher priority if you don't have time to see both. Visits here are free and you can take photos inside. There is much to love about San Giovanni. It is not only the ArchBasilica, even higher in the pecking order than St. Peters, but it is also considered the Mother of All Churches. Its history is outstanding, being founded by Constantine himself, it was the papel residency until 1309 and Popes where coronated here until the 19th century. Thus, while St. Peters grabs most of the attention today, it is San Giovanni that was the Star of the Catholic World for most of the past sixteen hundred years. But San Giovanni is not just about history. It is a magnificently decorated church with many beautiful things to see. The square in front of the church is nice and large allowing excellent views of the Basilica's classic Baroque facade, one of the finest in Rome. Inside, you will also find a huge nave lined with massive and beautiful statues of the twelve apostles. The marble floor tiles and the decorative ceiling, round off one of the most attractive nave areas in Rome. You will also find a huge, gorgeous alter, lined with attractive artwork as well as very nice mosaics present in the dome and chapel areas. The huge church doors and beautiful outdoor Logia area outside the church are also well worth finding while at San Giovanni. Overall, the beauty found inside and outside San Giovanni is really only matched by St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican. There are no other rivals to San Giovanni in this regard. To visit San Giovanni, you can the San Giovanni (Metro) stop to visit the church but it is still quite a walk so you might want to just take taxi to this location if you plan to start your day visitations at this location. In addition to a visit to San Giovanni in Laterano and the Scala Santa across the street, you can walk up Via Giovanni in Laterano to the very good Basilica di San Clemente and onward to the ancient Coliseum and Forum areas, making for a great 1/2 day or more of attraction visitations in Rome."

It is beautiful and we spent ages there.We rented headsets which is not something my husband usually likes to do but we were very glad we did as we learned so much about the history.Next to the Basilica is a building which houses the Scala Sance (Holy Stairs).............\"The Scala Sancta (Holy Stairs), wooden steps that encase white marble steps, are, according to Roman Catholic tradition, the staircase leading once to the praetorium of Pilate at Jerusalem, hence sanctified by the footsteps of Jesus Christ during his Passion. The marble stairs are visible through openings in the wooden risers. Their translation from Jerusalem to the complex of palaces that became the ancient seat of popes in the 4th century is credited to Saint Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine I. In 1589, Pope Sixtus V relocated the steps to their present location in front of the ancient palatine chapel (the Sancta Sanctorum). Ferra\u00f9 Fenzoni completed some of the frescoes on the walls\". (Copied from the information on St John of Lateran).When we were there the Scala Sancta was closed and unfortunately we did not have the time to go back.If you are planning to visit any churches in Rome you must see this one. Well worth the visit."

The side chapels are filled with beautiful works of art and offer a quiet place to sit and rest.Cool fact: the massive center bronze doors are the original Roman Senate house doors. Think about all the people that passed through them...many popes, kings, Julius Caesar, Cicero, and you...if they are open. Next door is the Lateran palace - home to the popes until they moved to the Vatican, and now a museum with limited hours. Visiting this basilica is taking a trip back to the earliest history of the Church and to me, sometimes feels more accessible than St. Peter's."

We were told no, paid about 5 euros each and went through security. The Security Guard asked us if we needed an English guide and we were given a guide who took us through the museaum, giving the three of us a personal tour, which was facinating. The funny thing was, the guard followed our 'tour' and had to keep turning lights on and off as we went.

The ceiling, the enormous statues of the 12 apostles, the chapels inside, etc. all make it one of the must-sees of Rome.The Scala Santa is amazing; the steps are marble encased in wood, so it's easier on the knees of those who climb it. There are 3 staircases; the middle one is the Scala Santa (28 steps) to be climbed only on your knees; the other two are for climbing up or down and for those who climb on their knees to go down. It is said these stairs were in Pilate's house in Jerusalem, and were the same that Jesus climbed when He was going to be judged/sentencedthe stairs were brought by Constantine's mother Helena, to Rome in the 4th century."

The best thing about this church to me was the original doors of the Senate, monstrous castings of bronze, used now as the doors to this church, which is the church which the Pope is priest of. St. Peter's is too big for me, and here you have great beauty but also a sense of the spiritual in the interior. Perhaps it's the simplicity of the long rectangular nave, with it's golden ceiling, with giant statues of the 12 Apostles or perhaps it's the amazing golden Basilica at the end, with it's mosaics, or perhaps it's the 18th century facade by Gallilei which is tranquil despite the statuary popping out of the roof or perhaps it's the cloister with its twisting inlaid marble columns. But there's a sense of age and purpose in this church, sometimes called the oldest or mother church. What can you say about a building which was restored for the first time in 460 after the Vandals sacked Rome. You can get there by Subway or bus. The bus back to town leaves from the front."

One can never have enough time to really know a place such as this but the beauty of its architecture and the adornment of its interior is enchanting. Even before that, the multi-statued exterior is a clear indication of what's to come. It would serve any traveller to review information about this sacred place before visiting to get the most from it. I loved the large mosaic on the interior dome. Take time to feel the place. Breathe with it. Enjoy another living historical experience here unique among all of Rome's churches."

Located a bit out of the way from most of the other main attractions in Rome means it has far fewer tourists.While quite impressive from the outside (but let's face it, impressive facades in Rome are a dime a dozen) it is only when you enter that you are left awestruck by its sheer beauty. Words can only fail to describe this place so I won't try, suffice to say that everything from the statues, to the frescoes, alter pieces and the architecture itself is sublime.Though still a tourist attraction, it is also a 'working' church and while photo's are allowed in all the main areas, the areas set aside for prayer are off limits to cameras providing a bit off peace and quiet from the normal hustle and bustle of Rome. There are also a number of confessionals with priests providing confession in a number of languages.Entry to the church is free though a donation is appreciated but not asked for. The same goes for the toilets. There is a donation box but it's not obligatory. Audio guides are available at the front door as well as 'audio-points' within for those who want a more in depth understanding of this place.Having seen many sights in this magnificent city, I have to say as far as churches go this was the highlight for me, even topping The Basilica and the Parthenon. I spent around an hour and a half here and left feeling refreshed.Two thumbs up - Highly Recommended."

The Papal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran is the cathedral of the city of Rome (not St. Peter's), and is the official seat of the Bishop of Rome, who is also the Pope. Apparently, it ranks above all other churches in the Catholic Church, including St. Peter's. It has the title \"mother church of the whole inhabited world\" and is the oldest among the four papal basilicas. It also houses the papal throne. To get to St. John Lateran, take the metro and alight at the Manzoni station. The basilica is just a few minutes walk from there.Like all the other papal basilicas, St. John Lateran has a Holy Door which is opened during Jubilee years, when pilgrims enter through the door to gain indulgence. This Holy Door was last opened and closed by Pope John Paul II. The Holy Door has oxidized except for the left foot of the Child Jesus, probably where numerous faithful keep rubbing it for luck or grace. I definitely rubbed the foot of the Child Jesus for both when I visited the basilica, as it was raining then, and I was praying for it to stop. And indeed, it stopped!Although not as big as St. Peter's, St. John Lateran is still massive. It has six existing papal tombs inside. Unfortunately, I only noticed Pope Martin V's tomb, which was pretty hard to miss considering it was located right in front of the confessio. The aisle of the basilica is flanked by niches with huge statues of the twelve apostles."

We did not find it, and we asked the workers at the church, they declined its presence in this church. Some, helpful! Knowledgeable! Worker said this church contains head bones (skulls!!!) of both St. Paul and St. Peter, and both are on display above the main alter. After some reading, the claim of St. Paul skull may be correct, and the rest of his body may be at a church called St. Paul Outside the Walls (Basilica di San Paolo Fuori le Mura). On the other hand, the skull of saint peter may be not. It happened that two days earlier I had private tour at the Vatican necropolis and the professor who guided us said that St. Peter bones (all 170 found pieces) are present in the graffiti tomb under the Vatican. I saw two bones of St. Peter that were displayed for us to view. Also I read at Frommer\u2019s the following about the steps; which I did not look for in this church: \u201cIt's alleged that the 28 marble steps (now covered with wood for preservation) were originally at Pontius Pilate's villa in Jerusalem and that Christ climbed them the day he was brought before Pilate. According to tradition, Constantine's mother, Helen, brought the steps from Jerusalem to Rome in 326, and they've been in this location since 1589. Today pilgrims from the world over come to climb the steps on their knees. This is one of the holiest sites in Christendom, although some historians say the stairs may date only to the 4th century.\u201dI strongly recommend reading some history or even travel books about this church before you visit it (I made a huge mistake by not doing that)."

It's still very elaborate and richly decorated but not in the over the top way that some other places in Rome are. The baptistry is a real highlight of any visit here, particularly the ceilings and frescoes in the side chapels. We had looked forward to seeing the cloisters as well but unfortunately the garden was actually being dug up and was cordonned off behind screens which rather ruined the effect."
