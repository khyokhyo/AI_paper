The longest is about 6 hours and you stop over at a small fishing village at the entrance to the Black Sea .This is a great adventure for all as you sail down the straits with all the history. You get great views and then you arrive for a 3 hours layover.When you arrive at Anadolu Kavagi pass up the restaurants and head up to Yorus Castle. It's a bit of a hike up but the views are spectacular. Then have lunch and enjoy the views up there. Walk back down and shop for souvenirs and have an ice cream before the boat takes you back.I especially enjoyed watching the shipping come through the passage into the straits.It helps you understand how strategically important the strait still is."

They were formed after tons of ice melting after the Ice Age, their birth dating back to 7-8000 BC. The Bosphorus is like a river connecting the Black Sea with the Marmara Sea which is an internal sea between the Aegean and the Black seas. However it is not a river, but a salt water strait with strong currents.It is beautiful and no matter how hard we try, we can't destroy its beauty. It changes color with different weather and can vary from green to gray to dark blue. It is lined with Yali's, which are beautiful wooden mansions by the sea. You can take a special ferry down the Bosphorus all the way to a fishermen's town near the Black Sea and see all the Yali's and the beauties of the strait. There are also many cafes and restaurants all along the Bosphorus.It is possible to swim in the Bosphorus but it isn't as clean as some years ago. Also beware of the strong currents."

You could take the local ferries, used by over a million people a day, to go to work and back or the more touristy ferries which provide brief commentary about the sites you see along the coastline. Either way, its a great experience and will remain as one of your lasting memories of Istanbul. The ferry ride from Eminonu to Uskudar (or Kadikoy) takes no more than 15-20 minutes. Beware that if you're sitting in an open-air ferry, it can get quite cold during the evenings and freezing during winter time."

The cruise out to to the Black Sea is stunningly beautiful. With the help of books I was able to identify the landmarks a lot better. Guides are also available. The full day option requires a 3 hour stay in a fishing village. The village is ok, but 3 hpurs may be too long there ( in my opinion). If I would have done things differently, I would have got a single ticket and travelled back independently."

If you stay in Istanbul more than 2-3 days, then you have to try the Bosphorus tour by ferry!There are several Companies that organize the tour, we tried the one organized by the Public Transportation Company (Sehir Hatlari).The tour starts every morning at 10.35 from Eminonu pier. It takes two hours to reach Anadolu Kavagi at the edge of the black sea. During the trip you will have nice views of Mosques, Palaces and Villas, you will go under the two Bosphorus Bridges and you will stop in front of the brand new third one. The stop lasts approx. 2 hours. The small village of Anadolu Kavagi is just a bunch of fish restaurants fighting to catch as much turists as possible therefore I suggest to climb up to the castle and take your lunch there, enjoying a beautiful view over the Bosphorus and Istanbul (the Castle itself is not interesting but the view pays back).Price: 25 TL per person (approx. 8 \u20ac), in my opinion a fair price for a full day tour."

Having only been in Turkey (Istanbul) about 4 hours after a 15 hour flight, I did a Bosphorus Straits boat cruise to ease myself in and get my bearings. And I am glad I did. The sheer size, strategic importance and beauty of the Straits was a perfect way to ease into taking on Istanbul by foot. (Tip: A lot of the tour boats do a short stop closer to the Black Sea point. While getting an ice cream is wonderful on a hot day, these places are for high volume tourism so don\u2019t expect anything unique. Also, if you are one of those picture taking addicts, you may find yourself fighting for a spot on the large boats given the number of people.)"

This particular cruise did not make any long stops. For us, a longer trip may have been boring...perhaps because we did not get off during the trip.

We struggled to decide between the shorter and longer cruise and ended up being really happy we went with the short one. A few hours is plenty of time to see the city from the Strait, and the views don't vary too much as you move down the Strait. With the longer option you need to get off the boat and spend a couple hours on land so it becomes a full day activity. Overall it's a great way to spend a few hours and see Istanbul from a new perspective!"

First of all Bosphorus is a natural canal connecting Marmara Sea with Black Sea. The entrance of the Bosphorus from the Marmara Sea is marked with the Maiden Tower (K\u0131z Kulesi). At this point we can see \u00dcsk\u00fcdar on Asian side and Be\u015fikta\u015f on European side. From this point, Bosphorus is about 30 km long and opens to Black Sea at Rumeli lighthouse on European side and Anadolu lighthouse on Asian side.If you travel the strait with car, you may only have little glimpses, because nearly all the strait is blocked with buildings. Therefore you have two options: Either travel by sea or sit in a restaurant or cafe near the Bosphorus. To travel by the sea, cheapest and one of the most pleasant alternative is scheduled ferries between two sides; such as \u00dcsk\u00fcdar-Be\u015fikta\u015f ferry, which generally operates every half an hour. Secondly there are small ferries operated by the government to visit almost all the Bosphorus, but they are very rare. Anyway, the schedule can be learned from ferry stations. Thirdly there are tourist boats, which are most common, but according to me, most unpleasant. Also some serious travel companies, like Fest Travel, offer special cultural-cruise tours, which can be the golden standard. Also if you can spend a little bit more, there are rentable motor yachts of varying size, from the docks at G\u00f6ksu River, Anadolu Hisar\u0131.If you prefer a visit from the land, best option is to have a seat in a fish restaurant just near the Bosphorus, with waves wetting your shoes. Never visit touristic restaurants. Go where the locals go. A cheaper alternative can be a cafe or tea house just near the water."

The pier is the one next to the Galata bridge.

There are alot of options when you decide to take a bosphorus tour but I personally feel the turyol ferry boat tour is the best.You can take the tram to karikoy station. From the station walk towards the left side towards the turyol ferryboat stationYou can take ferryboat metro from here to kadikoy and uskudar (the asian sides two major areas)Also you can get the bosphorus tour for around 12 lira. The best thing about this tour is that it is for about 1 HR 30 min and it doesn't stop anywhereIt's a non stop bosphorus tour excellent for people with time constraints.The ferry takes you showing you the European side u der the bosphorus bridge and take a turn back from the next bridge. Coming back you can see the asian sideIt's better to take snacks from outside as the ones offered on the ferry are expensive and not that fresh"

Some are cheaper, other being expensive due to availability of liquor and belly dancing activities on the cruise. However, either cruise you choose, you are definitely gonna enjoy the swift breeze in the mid sea with bluish waters all around you and a magnificent view of the city and shores.

The fun filled dinner cruise costs 40\u20ac without alcohol and 50\u20ac or 60\u20ac with alcohol. All inclusive with hotel pick up (at 1930 if you're staying in Sultanahmet) drop off (cruise ends midnight) unlimited alcohol (if that choice is taken), soda or coffee. Dinner is served at 9 pm (2100) and show starts at 10 pm. Hotels and big tour companies like Viator usually charge more and we almost paid a more expensive price. But as we walked from Hagia Sophia back to our hotel, we passed by a small inconspicuous store offering tours at more affordable prices. The company is called \"Turista\" and they have a variety of tours throughtout Turkey. The dinner cruise we bought is exactly the same as the more costly one offered by our hotel. Istanbul looks magical cruising through Bosphorus Strait, with the different lights from the churches, mosques, buildings, hotels and bridges. This outing should not be missed."

Tour boats typically go north via the European side of the channel and back via the Asian (or vice versa), so you get to see some of each as what was once called Constantinople evolved through the centuries. From thousand-year-old fortifications to some of the world's priciest waterfront villas, the city reveals various sides of itself in serene comfort, sparing the viewer Istanbul's notorious traffic."

The 2h trip is just enough to see amazing homes, palaces, mosques, and fortresses, on both Asian and European sides, and the bridges connecting the two. There's so much to see that the mind saturates after about an hour and after that, it's just a really nice, relaxing boat ride in an amazing part of the world.I took the audio guide but found it detracted from the overall experience so stopped using it after 45'. The technology is old and the interface is, well, what you would expect from 10-year old technology. Better to download your own audio, or buy a book. Take a jacket as it gets windy on the water, even in spring/summer. Best seats are in the back or on the left. Lots of people have read that you should queue 45' in advance for a good seat, so you won't be the only one in the know. The boat has three stories, the lower lever is inside, the middle level is covered but the left-side seats get the afternoon sun on the way up. And the top is largely uncovered so direct sun for 2h.

The lunch was pretty good, but I abstained from drinking any adult beverages since they were twice the price of Istanbul rate (aha - a captive audience). A person described points of interest including Dolmbahce Palace (the sultans' residence after they left Topaki), multimillionaire homes, Ruetti fortress built by the Ottomans in 1452 AD during the siege of Constantinople to stop the Byzantines from resupplying, the bridges (now two and builing a third), Bevik Cove (where the wealthy people live), etc. The halfway point was a 1/2 hour visit to Anadolu Kavagi, the last village before entering the Black Sea. I thought the place would be a tourist trap but was pleasantly surprised at the prices - cokes, beer, and fruit juice was less than half of Istanbul market prices - so we stocked up. The trip was a very nice way to spend an afternoon and see the Bosphorus and it's Asian and European sides.The price was reasonable - 220 lira (about $80 US) which included the boat trip, buffet lunch, and round trip transportation to/from our hotel.Tips - Bring a sweater especially if the projected temperature is 80 degrees farenheit or less.

You quickly realize why they say there are 16 million people in Istanbul. The city is spread out on both sides! You can get off at a number of the palaces or at a big park. Or you can just stay on the ferry for the 2+ hour round trip. It is very affordable. We did this twice we enjoyed it so much."

It was very punctual and orderly but takes more time to load on an doff the ferry that it does for the complete crossing. Once on board, we went to the top of the boat, and a number of tourists took bread crumbs to feed the seagulls. This made for a much more entertaining crossing. The weather was stormy but it didn't seem to make a difference for the crossing. There are som many nice sights to see along the way.

You can go ashore and climb to the castle (or take a taxi up the hill) for 3 hours and then enjoy a great fish meal at the pier. Truly a beautiful way to see the Straits and to look at many ancient buildings from a view you cannot get on shore. It is very inexpensive for a round-trip ticket and takes the better part of a day. Other trips for 90 minutes on the boat are available, but I would recommend this one."

The first trip which our hotel booked for us had a very well informed guide who made the trip fascinating . Many aboard chose to sit on a higher deck which had a very poor recorded commentary . Whilst they did see a pod of dolphins playing with the boat which we somehow missed they missed out on an excellent guide . Our second trip the following day was in a cruise ship which had made special arrangements to cruise the straits because it had cancelled tours of Istanbul for its passengers as a safety precaution . The commentary was not as comprehensive which was understandable in the circumstances but was in any event well appreciated by our fellow travellers ."

Seeing both the Asian and European sides of Istanbul from the water makes it easier to see how the city and its people function. Given that the city streets are often choked with vehicles, it clearly is easier for citizens to take a ferry across The Bosphorus when possible and walk whenever possible. We arranged a 2-hour private boat tour through Sea Song travel advisors in Istanbul. A good investment of time and money since we felt we were cruising on a private yacht for a quite reasonable price."

The hop on hop off trip is reasonable and allows you time to see all the sights that interest you. The view from the boat gives you wonderful panorama of Istanbul and a taste of the development process that Istanbul took over the centuries. Just be aware of the gentleman that comes around offering drinks and sandwiches, which he allows you to think are free at first, but they are NOT, as you find out before the cruiise os over - and they are over priced."

I spent 9 days in Istanbul, so this was the right answer for me. The public ferry leaves from Emin\u00f6n\u00fc to Anadolu, and your best bet is to get on the 10:35am ferry. I arrived at 9:50 in the off season, purchased my ticket and waiting in line to ensure I had an optimal seat for the one hour forty-five minute trip. This probably wasn't as crucial in the off-season, but there was still a line of about 50 people by 10:35! While Anadolu wasn't my favorite, I did enjoy sitting at an over-priced restaurant with a view of the Bosphorus for an hour, drinking coffee and eating my packed lunch.A much shorter option is to take the public ferry from Emin\u00f6n\u00fc to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar and back, which will run you a about 5TL round trip with your Istanbulkart, and give you views of the both sides of the city."

I think it contributes immensely to Istanbul's wonderful ambiance. I enjoy going down to the shore to watch ferries, tour boats, fishing vessels, freighters, tankers and -- on my most recent trip -- dolphins in the water. I especially like being out on the strait, even on chilly winter days.I've been on long and short Bosphorus cruises, leaving from the European side of Istanbul, and found it magical to look at settlements on two continents at the same time. I can see more during the day, but at night the lights on both shores are stunning. The least expensive way to be on the Bosphorus is to take a public ferry between Europe and Asia. I never tire of seeing the massive Hagia Sophia, coming and going. A ferry can cost less than the equivalent of $1 U.S., depending on its departure point.A fairly new way to be on the strait is the Hop-On Hop-Off Bosphorus cruise offered afternoons by Dentur Avrasya. The first boat leaves at 12:45 p.m. and hourly after that. Though passengers can stay on for the entire 1-hour, 45-minute cruise, each boat makes four short stops at places of interest in Europe and Asia. We got off twice in Asia, first to see Kucuksu Pavillion, a former royal hunting lodge, and then to explore Beylerbeyl Palace. On board, we sat on the upper deck to marvel at Ottoman mansions along the way and the magnificent Dolmabahce Palace.For those who have no interest in being on the water, two suspension bridges cross the strait, connecting Europe and Asia. A third -- Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge -- is under construction and is expected to be completed in May 2016."

On one bank is Asia, on the other Europe, and in between is a curious, two-current strait: The surface water travels from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara, and the colder, saltier current of water travels below it in the opposite direction. The ride is especially delightful on a sunny day, when the Bosporus is filled with ships of all nations on their way to and from Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and the Asian parts of Turkey. The trip takes you past upscale waterside suburbs with good seafood restaurants, wonderful imperial palaces, classic Turkish mansions, vast bridges that link the continents, and the fortresses of Anadolu Hisar and Rumeli Hisar. Keep an eye out for the stylish yalis (villas) that the Turkish aristocracy built along the waterfront. Some are fairly run-down, but others are beautifully restored, with expensive speed boats moored at their front piers. If your particular method of travel allows it, try to break for a seafood lunch at Anadolu Kavagi, at the Black Sea end of the Bosporus. Afterward, for a spectacular view of the Black Sea, climb to the castle at the top of the hill behind it."

Definitely worth the money, especially taking a private cruise rather than the overcrowded ferry.Saw Istanbul from a different perspective. Went past several universities, outdoor cafes, the luxurious yachts, the upmarket areas and sumptuous hotels.A completely different look at Istanbul, a change from the old part where there are thousands of people to a fairly quiet area. We saw the old fort, the floating club owned by a football team and ex-palaces previously owned by Sultans. We spent about two hours going up and down the river, saw the European side and the Asian side (still haven't figured out which is which). I would recommend a trip, you will enjoy it."

Some of the boats looked like old fishing trawlers, so be careful to choose a good one. There are many palaces built along the bosphorus on both banks and there are many mosques too, so it is a really interesting trip. The bosphorus runs between the sea of marmara and the black sea. The sea of marmara runs into the age an and then into the Mediterranean so it is a really important waterway. Worth a trip."

I took the full Bosphorus trip , all took around 6 hrs , you will need to go to Kabatas ferry port , this port is right beside kabatas metro station which you can go to it by funicular from Taksim metro station , it's only one station from Taksim.When I reached there I picked a random company which name is Dentur Avrasya, the ferry boat moved 11:15 am from Kabatas and passed by Bakistas 11:30 am, during the way to the port (Anadolu Kavagi) which took around 1:15 hrs, we were passing by a lot of Istanbul's old buildings on the shore of Bosphorus, we reached Anadolu Kavagi which is in the Asian side of Istanbul , a small village with stunning views to the Bosphorus and dead sea, to have this great view you will need to go up to the hill to visit Yoros Castle, the view from this point is breath taking , it's worth the effort of going up the hill , don't worry it's not so hard to go up , but be ready with a comfortable pair of shoes, there are signs to show you the qay to the castle from the port till the castle , so you will not get lost.We went up there and took some gorgeous photos , then we took lunch in a restaurant beside the castle which name is Yoros restaurant , the lunch was two main dishes , fish of course , as they have a great fresh fish taste in this area, the lunch cost was around 50 to 60 liras, then we went bach to the port, we took the ferry boat at 3:30 pm sharp back to Istanbul, on the way back we saw the great houses on the asian shore of Bosphorus, and some other old buildings.We reached Kabatas around 4:45pm.This is a great trip , with only 20 liras for the ferry boat per person , and if you needed to eat you will chose what's suitable for you.Enjoy and have a great time."

It took the ferry long tour around the Bosphorus from Eminonu port, once you get there there will be many tourist trapping tours that cost a lot of money and are not not as wholesome as the official tour. So try to avoid them. The official tour is taken from the last ferry just before galata bridge. it costs only 25TL. While the other tours are 4 or 5 times that.That being said, even the official tour is not that eventful, the ferry docs at a few ports around the strait, and only one stop at a fishing village where you can have lunch. The views of both sides of Istanbul are really beautiful during the trip. And the ferry has good beverage and snack service not included in the ticket price. At the fishing village, you have about 4 hours to have lunch at the extremely touristy restaurants there, the food is good and is mainly sea food. You can also hike to the castle on top of the hill, the castle itself is dull but there are some nice views from up there. And it's not really a hike, more of a walk up the street.If you're short on time, skip this trip, as it takes a lot of time with very little to be done."

They aren't packed and you get just relax in your chosen seat (or move around) for a couple hours as the waves crash and you are transported past many of the \"main\" historical and tourist sites.

Plus it saves buying umpteen different Jeton tokens for each journey.There are numerous ferry rides, if you have time ride out to the Princess Islands, or like I did take the hour long ferry ride from \u00dcsk\u00fcdar right along the Golden Horn to historic Ey\u00fcp where you can change into a cable car to the top of the hill.The ferries are part of Istanbul and are delightful, complete with buffet and chai waiters who will serve you a glass of chai for a few pennies. In summer you can sit outside and in winter be snug and warm inside sipping tea! No wonder the Istanbul people are so good natured if this isn't what their commute is like! Be aware that the ferries run spot on time so don't dawdle or you'll miss it - though if you do the waiting areas are heated (if you're there in winter of course)....Pick up a pocket timetable which is readily available and free - and show all of the routes and the cheap cheap fares.

It is Bosphorus Strait which brings Asia and Europe together. Earlier people use to use ferry to move across, but after 1973 this famous Bosphorus bridge helped people commute faster and safely."

You get to see different angles of all the famous landmarks eg. Blue Mosque . Highly recommended when in Istanbul."

If you've read Orhan Pamuk's book on Istanbul (which you should!), you'll notice how much emphasis he puts on the Bosporus in the life of the city. We noticed it in the recommendations made by our Turkish friends, who were always steering us toward the water, whether it be a Bosporus cruise, a ferry ride, or simply a waterside meal. If you spend a day, or even just an afternoon, on the Bosporus, you will see why. We did the all-day Bosporus cruise on the city ferries, which takes you up the Bosporus for an hour and a half, provides a 3-hour lunch stop at a village on the Asian side, and brings you back on another hour and a half ride. We got the audio guide, thinking we wanted to learn about everything on the way, but soon abandoned them, realizing we were better off watching the gulls, listening to the water, and taking everything in. The experience was magical. We were lucky to have a sunny, warm day in December. The water was deep blue, the gulls were everywhere, and the shores were dotted with houses, mosques, and medieval fortifications. Fishermen plied the waters while freighters made their way through the strait. We brought bread for the birds. As we approached Istanbul, the sun hung quite low, putting the city skyline in silhouette and illuminating everything from the Dolmaba\u00e7he Palace to Eminonu in orange light, making for one of the most spectacular urban views I had ever seen. Go. Don't miss this. (You can also drive along the shore, or simply take one of the municipal ferries to any port on the Bosporus. You don't need to take the tour!)"

No matter the season, it's an experience to remember, for a very cheap fare to get on a ferry. Ferries vary in time for the trip-there's one that is a leisurely sail slowly up the Bosphorus towards the Black Sea. You must consult the schedule well to make sure you get the right one. Morning and afternoon rush hours will mean the ferries will be packed with work commuters which will change the tone of your experience, so plan accordingly. The ferry ride in sunlight hours are a different treat to the ferry ride in the night time hours-and both are a must-do. Get your cameras ready, look good and enjoy. You're in the most special place on Earth!"

We can still see how restaurants, hotels and residences among others. try to attract customers by offering a view to Istanbul's main \"asset\".And even though is one of the busiest straits in the world, it inspires pace and serenity when you are around it.Just go to a cafe or a restaurant by its shore in the neighborhoods of Be\u015fikta\u015f, Ortak\u00f6y, Arnavutk\u00f6y or Bebek and you will understand. Or simply take a boat crossing from the European side to the Asian side and viceversa and the waves, the smell, the wind and the seagulls will stay in your mind for years.However, the best two ways to enjoy it by far are the Long Bosphorus Tour which departs from the port of Emin\u00f6n\u00fc in the European side of Istanbul, right from the place where the strait begins in the Sea of Marmara to 2 towns located at the other end, close to the Black Sea, one in the European side and one in the Asian one. On the way you can enjoy looking at the fortresses built hundreds of years ago by the empires ruling these lands; the villas built by famous people, including sultans of the Ottoman Empire or the 2 bridges (plus one currently under construction) connecting both continents.The second best way to enjoy it is at night, thanks to tours as the one provided by Istanbul Tourist Pass. The tour normally departs from the port of Kabata\u015f up to the 2nd bridge, allowing you to enjoy the magnificence of the city lit up by the lights of palaces, touristic landmarks, mosques, shopping malls, buildings, etc. The tours also include dinner and traditional shows to make sure tourists expecience the best the city has to offer."

I'd recommend a round trip on the Kadikoy-Sanyer ferry for a cheap view of the entire straight. You can also do side trips on other ferries, and that particular ride has a couple of stops on the European side. Only one ferry a day does that route, but down in the ancient area of Byzantium, ferries are every 20 minutes or so from many locations on the Asian and European side, and all the rides are cheap. There are also tourist boats that include some commentary on the sites to be seen, and those are also relatively inexpensive."

It is a unique waterway because the waters flow from North to South on the surface and about 15 meters deeper, while an even stronger current goes to North. They never mix because the surface waters are of very low salinity (less than 8 %o) while the water from the Mediterranean has a higher salinity than the oceans. Newest research suggests that this place was the stage for the Flood about 9.000 years ago. And the city about 8.000 year old. The Strait was before the Flood the valley of a river, and it still looks like a flooded valley with hills on both sides. The width changes between 500 m and about 2.000 m, the depth is about 60 m. On both sides were villages long before Jesus Christ was born. Now, the city on the South end, earlier Byzantium, later Constantinople, and now Istanbul, spreads over the whole length. The wooden old houses built at the edge of the water, yal\u0131, are now restored and dwelled by the wealthy from Istanbul and the Middle East. It is said, that the Russian population counts about 250.000 while other nationalities are not counted because this city has been one of the most cosmopolitan places of the world. You can travel the entire Strait either with public transportation (taxi, dolmus (collective taxi, very cheap), bus on both sides or take a boat. The cheapest boats are those for public transportation with incredibly low prices, party boats, tour boats etc. are much more expensive, but still affordable, and the highlight is renting a boat for yourself. You can get some from $ 100/day till about $ 15.000 (in Ortak\u00f6y). You can also combine bus/boat/taxi as you wish. "

The short cruise is in fact quite adequate, had I known that we would not have taken the longer one. We thought we could actually see the Black Sea as some claimed on the net, but that is not true. The longer cruise is chaotic from lining up to purchase tickets to disembarking at 4pm. It can get very crowded and noisy on the ship. There is nothing to do at the last stop where you get off for 3 hours. The castle ruins are in fact too far to walk one way, let alone return. Then the only option you have is to hang around the harbor which is lined with similar looking seafood restaurants all emitting terrible burnt grilled fish smells which stink up the whole harbor and there is no escaping it. For lack of anything to do we ate at one of them. Not cheap and not good. I got very sick that night, can't tell if it was from the seafood.The stop before last looked more promising, it had some seafood restaurants, but also some other buildings and dwellings. Perhaps that would have made a better stop for the 3 hours.Along the way you do see the various buildings so don't forget your camera. But I'd still say the 1.5 hrs cruise would allow you to see quite a bit without getting bored and forced to spend 3 hrs on shore."

Our timing was tight to make our airport transfer, but my boyfriend was promised that we would be dropped off first at the end of the cruise at our hotel so that we could hopefully make our airport transfer. When we arrived for our cruise the next morning it turned out there was no transport at all. We had to walk to the boat and we would have to make our own way back at the end of the day. It was poorly organised and the travel agent used the timings merely as a suggestion. The travel agent then tried to convince us to get a taxi after the cruise even though that would have meant we were stuck in traffic. Thankfully, I knew we could get the tram to our hotel much more quickly and we did that instead. The boat cruise itself was poor, the commentary was minimal, we had an hour at Rumeli Fortress which was closed for Winter, so 30 minutes would have been fine and then 30 minutes on the Asian side where there was even less to do,10 minutes for a photo stop was all that was required. I work as a tour guide and if I ran my tours like this I would never work again! I suppose you can't expect much for 10 Euros, but we would have been better off using the ferries than going on this cruise. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."

The views from the boat were quite revealing. Once out of the Istanbul city area, the scenery was beautiful and the mansions along the river showed that there was 'money' in this region. The Bosphorus is a very busy shipping lane into the Black Sea, but the beauty of the area is not spoilt by the big tankers. It seemed to us that only a few were allowed to travel up the river at a time, so that the views were not spoilt for the site seeing public. I would certainly recommend a boat ride along this stretch of river."

If you are planning an economic tour, I would recommend using the government run service - Seher Haltari. Full day tour leaves around 10:30 from Kabatat and returns at 4:30, costing 25 TL per person and another 10 TL for the audio guide.It breaks for 3 hours at the Island where you can see the European Castle & have a nice fish dinner either on the shore or up near the castle - both with awesome views.

It is about 25 miles long and varies in width between 1 and 3 miles. It is a very busy sea way handling about 6000 plus ships a year. The tour stars just inside the Golden Horn and travels north along the European side passing under the 2 main bridges joining Europe and Asia, a third is currently under construction near to the Black sea. Either side of the straight has a great range of buildings to admire from palaces, castle fortifications, and the homes of the rich and famous. One property was sold for 100 million euros. This is definitely not a cheap place to set up home.our boat stopped at a village Anadolu Kavagion the Asian side just before the Black Sea where the third bridge is being constructed. Here you have about 1/2 hour to get a coffee or buy some souvenirs. The boat then travels back down the Asian side. A hot buffet is served on-board during the trip. This is an absolute must do trip!"

While in Istanbul, you literally can't miss the Bosphorus Strait - it's that large, moving body of water separating the European and Asian halves of Turkey. If you hike over the busy Galata bridge, you're crossing the Bosphorus and you can check the box that you've seen it. For those who might want to spend more quality time on this body of water, I'd recommend a cruise - but be selective about which cruise you book and do some homework to understand what you can expect. I've been on two Bosphorus cruises - one was an economical sunset cruise that included a brown bag to put over my tepid can of Efes, and the other was a higher-end nighttime cruise complete with dinner, drinks and (fairly ridiculous) belly dancing acts and folkloric dance (food = meh; drinks = watered down). Whatever your financial situation, there are options to take a cruise or ferry. Both cruises I took were spectacular in their own right and provided different ways to see waterfront houses, landmarks and the illuminated suspension bridges. Bring layers of clothing to keep warm, and be prepared to spend at least 2-3 hours on a cruise (it's a commitment!). I dressed casually on both cruises, but some folks on the higher-end ride were dress to the nines - though somehow stilettos don't seem like the very best choice for this adventure (although almost as entertaining as the belly dancers)."

Cruise starts from the Galata bridge area and one can see the distinct architectures of both the Asian and European influence on Istanbul architectureSnacks n juices / tea is available on payment.Try opting for a periphery seat on the boat for better views"

And that's when I said his first offer of 120 was too high.I thought if I paid more money, it would be a cozier boat with an English guide. It was nothing of the sort. And I just threw all that money in the proverbial toilet. I also did it in the rain, which was less than desirable. But I'm glad I didn't miss it because the Borphorus is what makes Istanbul Istanbul. I must say it was hard for me to find the building where you could buy tickets on the government-sponsored boats. I saw buildings for boats to the Asian side, but couldn't find the building that looked like the municipal boat center for the Bosphorus cruise. (If you find it, let me know!) When I asked for directions, I fell into the scam. The hazards of travelling alone on a shoestring. But I factored a scam or two into my budget. I saved a fortune by avoiding a tour. What I lost on the cruise I made up a hundredfold on my hostel, the Taksim House on Purtelas Street. (Be careful, there are several Taksim Houses in Istanbul). The lady who runs it has a conscience and is a treasure of information for people trying to do this inexpensively. Listen to her and watch your step with the scam artists. I met two, and the second introduced my to his cousins! He ate up the better part of my second day. (But that was an education in itself.)"

Be careful with other boat tours that charge up to 35\u20ac - that is a very overpriced boat ride (if it does not include any food or entertainment). You get beautiful views of Istanbul and all the lovely minarets and mosques around he city"

The cruise we went on was only the lower and middle Bosphorus, not all the way to the Black Sea. We started northwards staying closer to the European side and returned along the Asian side.We start with seeing the Golden Horn, the 19th century Dolmabahce Palace, Mosque and clock tower, the Ciragan palace, the first Bosphorus bridge (as we pass under the bridge we can see the road high above with a clearance of over 200 feet above the water), and then the Mecidie mosque in Ortakay, and the Fortress of Europe. Along the middle Bosphorus you pass a few quaint townships and villages.At the second Bosphorus bridge (Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridge) we turned southwards along the Asian side.We saw the Kucuksu palace and the Maiden's Tower before ending the cruise near the Dolmabahce pier.Lovely cruise.

Such a mix of cultures with the European side and the Asian side and the range of architecture and different skyline has to be seen to be believed. Really beautiful part of the world and something I will always remember. Peaceful but also bustling and so full of different craft going about their business in a seemingly ad-hoc manner across the water."

By travelling on the ferries up the Bosphorous you really get an understanding of how important this waterway is, strategically, separating Asia from Europe. We especially like the two castles facing each other across the straights, and there are some lovely summer houses on the water front. There are plenty of boat trips available,for different durations, but we chose to take local ferries that criss-cross the water from Europe to Asia and back - each trip is 4 TLY (less than \u00a31). That meant we could stop wherever we wanted, so we had a coffee on one side and lunch on the other. It was probably less efficient, but felt \"authentic\" and more fun. We went in late September and it was pretty chilly - take lots of layers."

Turyol is the company to go with - boarding dock right next to the fish sandwich boats.These 1.5 - 2 hour cruises are frequent, so wait for the next ride if you can't get good seating. Try to board early (30-min) and look for seats on the left side of the boat - works both for outbound and return trip. Typically, these 12TL/person cruises are packed in tourist season, so feel free to sit on metal section right next to the railing for good pictures (otherwise someone else is likely to block your view). Also, avoid this cruise on a rainy day. We had initially planned to take the longer cruise on our last day in Istanbul. Due to change in weather conditions, we decided do the shorter cruise the day before. Next day the weather was horrible with couple of hours of torrential rains - felt really bad for people doing the cruise that day.Cruises booked through hotels are expensive, but include other activities and lunch. We did see couple of smaller boats with very few people in them (also operated by Turyol) - not sure if these are booked through hotels. However, these are likely to offer unobstructed photo opportunities.Suggest taking the cruise couple of hours before sunset."

The captain was friendly and very happy to take us all on a tour, first along the eastern shore line and then once back across the Strait back to Istanbul along the western shore. The Captain served tea (Chai) to everyone and quite honestly, I thin we had a better time that the big boat tour we missed. My small son was allowed to steer the boat for a short distance and that made his entire day! Ours to! Fantastic journey. Riding on the Bosphorus is like riding at the top of a water fall. The water is moving incredibly fast and its as dark as night. Had a really good time. Ignore the time I visited, that is as far back as trip advisor will go and this trip took place back in 2002."

We contemplated doing a guided tour that was more expensive (around 35 Euros per person), but our hotel recommended the Turyol instead. It leaves every hour, on the hour, and it costs 12 TRL per person (around $4 US dollars). You can also purchase an audio guide for around $3 US dollars per person. It takes about an hour and a half and goes down each coast line giving you plenty of time to take pictures and listen to the audio guide. It does get crowded so would recommend getting there early and sitting on the upper outside seats of the boat if you want to get good pictures."

If we hadn't done the Big Bus Tour the previous day, we wouldn't have a clue of what we were seeing. Commentary quality can vary and the amount of useful information often too brief to be useful. Some ferry lines are comfortable, clean and have good PA systems, but others leave much to be desired. Most cruises are 2 hours durations, but the longer ones include diner and a show. All have snack bars and toilets. Suggest some research before buying tickets. Sehir Hatlari are the best value. We bought a \"discounted\" cruise ticket from some men who insinuated they were part of the Big Bus Tour company. The bus drivers seemed to know this group of men and this added to the illusion that this was a legitimate business. The men said they'd walk us to the boat a few minutes away. The walk turned out to be 15 minutes weaving in and out of alleys, and the crowd of fellow passengers grew with every turn. Finally, we crossed a makeshift gangway in a remote section of the Kennedy Caddesi - a distance away from the main ferries. On the conclusion of the trip, we were told to make our own way back to Sultanahmet by hailing a cab (during rush hour!) or walk the 3 kms. Furious and exhausted, it spoiled the evening for us."

It was arranged by our hotel as part of a multi-day package. I can not recall the specific tour boat but based on the brochures and our visual observation, the several tour boats are roughly the same in cost and tour specifics. In our case, we took a 2.5 - 3 hour tour that started at the Golden Horn and went up the Bosporus past the Bosporus Bridge. It stopped at the Beylerbeyi Palace,a summer place built in the 1860s. We took 30-40 minutes to tour the palace and grounds before returning to the Golden Horn.For us, the ability to see Istanbul from the water was essential. It gave us a visual perspective on the city as well as an appreciation of the variety of the harbor. The tour guide was able to tell us about the major sights and give us historical nuggets about certain buildings or activities.The end result was that we got oriented to istanbul and saw much more than the historic old city. It also whet my appetite to take a longer cruise either into the Sea of Marmara or the Black Sea and observe more of this beautiful country."

We chose the all day excursion that made several stops on both sides (European & Asian) and stopped in Anadolu Kavagi (Beykoz) for almost 3 hours. That was time for a hike up to the Fort & lunch. The trek up was challenging considering the temperatures that day but we made it and we're not youngsters. The views made it all worthwhile! The Black Sea lay before us shining in all its' splendor. We will never forget that.  The village had many places to eat and shops for souvenirs. I suggest you go beyond the restaurants upon embarking and hit the places further in for quality and price. As with Istanbul the people are lovely and we noshed on midye tav a (fried skewered mussels) & balik ekmek (fish bread-fish sandwich) that were both on my eat list. After the rigorous hike up to the fort we enjoyed an Efes beer before getting back on the boat.  The ferry was full of international travelers who make traveling fun & entertaining. We all were awestruck at the beauty we passed on the shores as we passed. Conversations flowed freely as you got to know individuals and chatted with those around you. This is what travel is about especially when confined on a ferry leisurely traveling up the Bosphorous. The sights along the way were spectacular. It was a beautiful day with the sun high above and the breeze feeling marvelous as we spotted a palace, another historic sight or beautiful vacation homes that lined the way. My only suggestion isdepending on which ferry you take, you may want to bring a small pack of kleenexwith you. If you've done your homework in researching customs in the area it came as no surprise when I went into the bathroom and spotted both \"holes\" and no paper.I'll leave it at that but remember should you embrace the culture --never use your right hand..."

My husband had his shoes shined by one of the local people there - I swear his shoes' lives have been extended considerably - and they have never looked as good. The person shining his shoes tried to converse with us in the best he could, but we were able to communicate the essentials of life: number of children and our location of origin. I am pretty sure he overcharged us for the memorable (yes, it was that) experience (25 lire), but he earned it by virtue of the number of component parts to the 'shine' - I gave up counting after six of them."

And in order to know about the sites you pass you would need to get an audio guide. I think it was 10 or 15 t (the long cruise - up to the plack sea and back - was I think 25 t. The prices and schedules are available on their website."

Over the years we have taken a lot of scenic tours on rivers, lakes etc. we did not book through a tour company but simply took the tram, bought a ticket and got on. The view from the boat is great but the boat by North American standards is pretty bad. The cover over the top of the boat was full of bird crap and was disgusting to look at. The toilet on board was the worst I have ever smelt, plugged and would not flush. The cool part of the trip was starting on Europe and stopping in Asia before returning to Europe. You do get a different prospective from the water than you do from the land and that was the good part Seeing some of the million dollar homes was also cool. I would not rate this as high as trip advisor does in terms of things to do in Istanbul. Istanbul is a unique city with lots of great places to visit, I would leave this when I have hit all the other high spots"

Our pre-booked tour became a bit of a farce as the company we had paid bumped us onto another tour which didn't include the lunch or stop-over we had been promised. It was all very last minute despite booking it a few weeks in advance, the transport from the hotel was very late & had other pick-ups to do before arriving at the harbour. Our guide was panicking & we ran across the busy bus station to keep up with her, she then bought tickets for the regular local ferry which we could have done ourselves! Our group was split up on the ferry due to the chaos and despite our guide's best efforts to describe the variety of sights on either bank we felt neglected at times & could have achieved a similar experience with a guide book a ferry ticket for a fraction of the cost. However the city, the history, the architecture & the atmosphere were all fantastic. A poorly organised tour emphasised the difficulty of pre-booking with an unknown company even if through a reputable online agent such as Viator/TripAdvisor. Thankfully a sizeable refund was received following a battle with both tour companies but the half-day experience we had been looking forward to never happened :-("

Simply to stand at the waterside and watch the coming and going of shipos and boats is fascinating. The Bosphorus Tour by boat is a 'must' for any visitor to the city, but do not waste your money by listening to one of the innumerable touts who iwll accost you. Just go to the shipping company's ticket office and pay a trifling sum for the six hour trip. Three of those hours are spent at the terminla village, Anadolu Kavagi, which is twice as long as needed, the village having little to commend it. The trip is remarkably good value however, but so too is a journey on the ferry accros to Kadikoy on thr Asian shore, a mere 15 minutes or so. At times the odour of fish can be compelling."

There are short trips of a couple of hours and longer trips that let you go swimming and stop for various sights.Then decide the time of day you want night time for lights and sunset,or daytime for sights. Then what do you want from the boat a meal entertainment and what level of music or to some people noise. Beware of booze cruises if that's not what you want.Then if you are not on a tight budget you may want to pick from a reputable travel agent or get your hotel to recommend a trip. If you go to the ferry area by tram - the budget option understand that small boats roll in the swell if this makes you nervous or sea sick. Often the cheap options will tell you incorrectly that you have booked a larger boat when you have in fact booked a small converted fishing boat. This is OK if you have sea legs and a hat in the daytime as it may not have cover. So armed with caution sunscreen and some knowledge do it it's a great view and not to be missed. Try to include a fish sand which and delicious pickles- the pink things in a plastic cup that go perfectly with your fishwich. Prices start at about 12 TL and go up. Enjoy."

It was very pleasant and relaxing, many in our group enjoyed the trip by boat. You could get a guided trip, and the guide will explain all the sites on both sides of the river, so you get a different perspective on the sites that you see from land. It was very pleasant.I don't recommend to take the long trips or ones with dinner, the food is really average and you don't get your money's worth at all. Don't be drawn to the scammers at the port who ask for large sums for this cheap trip.Do your research on the Internet and you can find cheap large boats that travel both sides all day, so you don't get stuck with the scammers. Be careful these guys smell a tourist a mile away, so prepare from your hotel, be safe, and enjoy your excursion for the afternoon."

We rode some of the commuter ferries to get between the European side and the Asian side, the ferries are a great way to get around and a cool way to see the city. There are also \"Hop on, Hop off\" ferries that are pretty cool too. We used both methods and were able to see a lot of the city, the palaces, bridges etc. It was scorchingly hot in Istanbul during our visit (in August) so, having the ability to see the city while relaxing on a boat was really nice."

The ferry went from Galata Bridge to a small town near the Black Sea where we went ashore for 90 minutes before we re-boarded the same ferry for the return trip. Many beautiful sites along the way!"

There are many boat tours advertised, but the best one is the one run by the municipal transport authorities, Sehir Hatleri. The short tour (2 hours) costs only 12 TL. Just be sure to get an audio guide on the dock though (10 TL) as there are no loudspeakers or announcements during the journey. I actually prefer it that way, rather than have loudspeakers booming every few seconds. If you simply want to relax, you can turn off the audio guide and enjoy the views."

At the half-way point there was the option to swim from the boat or to visit a former fishing village on the Asian side for shopping etc. I meant to swim, but was put off by the jellyfish! So I shopped, and found that prices for all sorts of souvenir items were a fraction of what exactly the same things cost in Istanbul - eg a lovely cushion cover for 10 lira, which at the Grand Bazaar and on-street shopping in Istanbul was 45 lira.The views all along the Bosphorus were spectacular, and the boat was comfortable with plenty of shady seating.

It took about a couple of hours in the morning and the boat went up and down the strait and the guide gave us information about the landmarks on both sides of the strait. I would recommend this cruise to everyone. You have to do it at least once."

The cruise itself is fine and you can see many of the key points of the city along the way but the commentary was effectively non-existent. Between the noise of the engine, the poor audio system and the accent of the commentator it was difficult to hear/understand anything. If you are seeing the sites but don't know what you are seeing it is pretty worthless.It was quite cheap around 15TL but I would rather pay much more and learn something. You might as well take the ferry for 4TL than this. If we were staying longer I would have looked for a private boat tour."

The cruise is an excellent way to see some of the historic buildings and, with a good guide to describe the sites, it is worth the time and money (our cruise cost 212 TL for two and included a stop at the Spice market and a tour of a mosque). The young woman who guided our tour was a bit difficult to understand but, once on the boat, she used a microphone and was much clearer.

At Dusk the scenery is gorgeus and the lights of Kenpiski hotel mix up with the blue background and the colorful lights of the bridge, so your photos will be indeed very interesting.

My 82-year-old mother and I bought an evening cruise over the Bosphorus from the hotel. To me, it was good although a little pricey (EUROS60/person). We got a hotel pick-up, a nice cruise with on-board dinner (average taste & portion; not enough free healthy drinks), rather slow service, interesting shows (e.g. very good belly dancing... BUT sitting at the back, we couldn't see so well and they could be repetitive!). However, all in all, the whole experience was valuable.Then, I took her on the Kadikoy ferry--to the Asian side of Istanbul. The boat to the other side was good and air-conned, but the one coming back wasn't all that good. My mother loved the experience and we paid only 4 lyras each for each way (8 lyras X 2 for the whole trip!). There was a kind ASK ME volunteer named Sema who gave us excellent information on how to cross the Bosphorus and helped us buy the tokens. Also, on the way to the Asian side, my mother started talking with one gentle Turkish lady and in the end we exchanged our email address. We had a very fresh fish and cheap lunch that day. On the last day, my mother wanted to do the crossing again but unfortunately we didn't have the time. But I must say that the people on the Asian side seemed to be more hospitable and sincere."

Once across the straight the Galatta Tower is easily identifiable and is a short walk from the ferry terminal. You also get a different view of Istanbul from the Northern side of the straight and therefore a couple of different photo oppertunities"

Istanbul has a spectacular skyline best appreciated by boat, especially on a warm and sunny day. Words will not do it justice. Best to look and book for one of the Hop Off Hop On tours that let you get off and wander in some of the more scenic and historic areas for 45 minutes until the next boat comes..all for one ticket price. And for pure romance you can always take a sunset tour so you will be charmed by the (many colored) lights of the big city and historic palaces..and the bridges...with the moon above.If you are looking for terrific camera shots..hoping to maybe see a dolphin or two frolicking in the straits, love seeing the big ships, and have a passion for beauty in architecture then DO definitely take the long, leisurel Bosphorus tour."

It was a private cruise, though u can take theirr water taxi or a group cruise for a cheaper price. The ride lasted around 2.5-3 hours. The view was lovely with many coffee shops/restaurants situated along both sides of the bosphorus strait. You can also see many houses and villas built along side one part of the bosphorus with houses and villas built all the way up on the hills and surrounded by huge trees and greenery. You will definitely feel envious of such residents and owners. Some passengers on other boats will wave at u and u'll wave back which always makes us smile. The weather was great because it was close to sunset and the sun wasn't blazing hot. When u reach back, u'll find boiled corn sellers which is just what u need after a long ride."

We were offered a trip for 90 euros per person (5 of us) for an hour and a half cruise on the Bosphorous, but the concierge at our hotel recommended the governmental boat-yard, and from here we spent only TL 45 for all of us. The boat was huge with leather seats on the top deck, and a nice air-conditioned sitting area in the bottom deck. We thoroughly enjoyed our almost two hour cruise. It is so beautiful and refreshing. It is also guided in the sense that announcements are made in Turkish and English about all the places of interest which are being crossed, both on the European and Asian sides. Also it has a few stops where one can hop on and hop off at no extra charge.A must do, but don't waste money on private boats etc. Also make sure to have your camera and phones ready for some amazing photos, while of course going on a bright , sunny day."

I recommend to sit outside with a cup of turkish tea, and just soak in your surroundings. It takes roughly 20 min and truly worth the trip. On your way you might see dolphins as well, which is an unexpected surprise! In addition you should also see the Maiden's Tower, very picturesque."

It is something you can enjoy from a seat on the promenade or from the deck of one of the many ferry boats which carve their way across what must be one of the busiest waterways in the world. You can book boat cruises and even dinner cruises on the Bosphorus. The traveller can go a short distance or follow it all the way to the Black Sea. We were lucky enough to cruise through it on an ocean liner. It was amazing! Photo opportunities at every turn: beautiful buildings, fabulous architecture, pretty vistas. We have now seen it from several of the perspectives which I listed above and have been spellbound by each. The best view, probably, is at night when many of the buildings are lit. See it from as many angles as possible."

Highly recommended.This is one of those places you have to see \"in person\" to appreciate the \"busy-ness\" of this seemingly chaotic waterway junction spanning Europe and Asia as a gateway from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus. And it's somewhat mystical too. If you know some ancient history and languages from this part of the world (as I do) you can visualise how and why the Ancient Greeks and so many other peoples occupied, fought over, and traversed this territory over the millennia.Of special interest to those from highly regulated societies like the U.S. will be the water traffic. Take a look at what goes on here and then imagine the reaction of the US Coast Guard. This place is chaotic. The Coast Guard would have a field day here citing traffic violators for unsafe navigation and loading practices. Yet there's something attractive too about these somewhat non-regulated cultures \u2014 a pleasant departure from the overbearing, over-regulated west. It's all so captivating.My wife and I had a chance to view the criss-crossing boat traffic from the vantage point of cruise ship in June 2015. We enjoyed it. We think you will too. I'll upload some pix when I get a chance.Enjoy!"

The best way to really get a feel of its importance to history is to take a boat trip along it. Bigger than a large city river but human in size. It meanders like a river and you can see lots of interesting buildings including fancy villas on both sides of the banks. Great to cruise under both bridges and appreciate the size of them and how they link the continents. Most tourist boats depart from the same place and are double deckers with the upstairs open to the sun. Our boat was a 2-3 hr cruise including a stop at a hunting lodge. They half covered the upper deck with a sunshade tarpaulin pulled over on wires. They keep the other half open so you can get a view of the bank. Not obvious when you get on which side will be shaded. When sunny you want the shade. The uncovered side is nearest the far bank of the Golden Horn when travelling to the Bosphorus. i.e when getting on the boat with the boat pointing into the dock nose first, the shaded side will be on your left. Drinks can be bought on board cans of pop 5tl as is instant coffee. Loos on board can be a bit smelly. Some good informative guiding through the loudspeakers but a little spasmodic and not easy to hear at the back of the boat. Guide stand next to the bar near front of upper deckWe booked ours at the hotel which included hotel pick up. This was by far the worst part. Nearly an hour to do 4 hotel pick ups with lots of waiting and no explanation. in order to travel a mile or so to the dock. If we had known we would have taken the tram, air conditioned, and 10min to get there. Booking via hotel doesn't include a return trip so beware."

The beauty of Istanbul, is it's use of the river system the timings, and arrivals at the various terminals are second to none.

No problem! You'll see the domes and minarets of Old Istanbul, Leander's Tower (K\u0131z Kulesi), the magnificent fa\u00e7ade of Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace, the sprawling new districts of office towers, and the sweep of the Bosphorus to the north and the Sea of Marmara to the south.This is the shortest and least expensive kind of Bosphorus cruise. It's not really a cruise, of course but we enjoyed a lot."

The hustle and bustle of the local's life at the market nearby, just adds on to the surreal feeling.

This is probably the best place if one wants to view Istanbul and have a fairly good idea of spread of the city. starting from the Sirkeci (area near Sultanahmet / Egypt (Spice) Bazar and taking you to the place where two continents (Asia and Europe) face each other and then towards the new Istanbul area. One can view / witness the sea areas around Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi, Bosphorus Bridge, Dolmabache Palace and even beautiful views of the Galata Tower and the city itself. Its a no miss thing in Istanbul, which in my opinion is highly under rated city in the world as compared to what it has to offer to the tourist. Beautiful City with great options."

A Bosphorus cruise is a worthy activity while in Istanbul. There are two hours cruises and 4 hour cruises. A two hour cruise takes you from the cruise docks which are opposite the New Mosque and you sail towards the left banks all the way to the second bridge. You are in the Asian part of Istanbul by then. On the way back the cruise sails towards the right banks. Most cruises don't provide guiding so read up on what you will see on both left and right sides of the strait. A ticket is priced between 15 and 25TL for the 2 hour cruise."

I was going to take the full day trip departing at 10.35 from Eminonu pier and only returning at 16.30 for 25TL but looking at the long queues of tourists and the fact the ship did not have many outdoor viewing seats would have meant I'd be stuck downstairs with poor views, therefore I decided to pass. Instead I walked 30 secs to the second departure terminal along and caught a ferry to Kadikoy on the Asian shore. It costs 2 TL each way on an Istanbulkart (which you can't use for the long tour). The journey was short taking approx 20 mins. However the boat was better as there was a nice open upper deck with loads of room and no tourists. You pass Topkapi Palace, Blue mosque and Hagia Sophia so I was able to get great photos. I had a look around in Kadikoy and then jumped on another ferry back. But if you want lunch there are loads of places and a local market to look around. Also if you want to carry on your trip there are also lots if other destinations Eg prince's islands to carry on from there too. This trip may be preferable for those who want to go to the Asian side of Istanbul and see the Bosphorus whilst getting a few photos and save half a day."

Go to the ferry port at eminou, look for the ferry kiosk just near the underside of the Galatta Bridge (follow your nose - it's just near the fish caf\u00e9s!). The tour is clearly advertised, it leaves at 4.30 pm but get there half an hour early. It's a huge ferry so little chan of missing out on a seat. Don't bother with the audio guide - it has very little information other than the names of the buildings (a mix of palaces, private residences, mosques and schools) and the back stories are pretty basic - built by a sultan or rich person either as a palace or summer residence. Famous people from days gone by were hosted there. Yep that's it! Have lunch before hand at a restaurant around the Bridge - there are many to chose from but most have the same menu. We went to the very last on the northern side. Really cute little place with quirky wooded tables and benches covered in cushions. Has a great choice of the usual Turkish fare (the lentil soup is really lovely) as well as pizza, pastas, burgers and toasted sandwiches and potato wedges for those who are feeling Turkished out. Great choices for kids."

You can pay an awful lot of money to the touts who hang around the docks at Eminonu, or walk straight up to the Sehir Hatlari ferry terminal and buy a ticket for 25TKL - about US$9. The ferry for the day trip leaves at 10.35 but if you want a seat in the open on the top deck you need to get there by about 10.00am. The ferry makes 3 or 4 stops on its way towards the north end of the Bosphorus strait and arrives Anadolu Kava\u011f\u0131 about 12.15. There's then a 3 hour wait and you can walk to the ruined castle at the top of the hill and have lunch at any number of restaurants at the top of the hill or next to the ferry. Return time is 3pm and it takes about 90 minutes to returnI gave this three stars. It's not my kind of thing as I like to be active. We did this on day 4 of our trip when we thought we'd like to have a rest from sightseeing. The 3 hour wait at lunch is an hour too long. On a warm sunny day it should be quite pleasant but it was grey and cloudy and the river and surrounds didn't really look their best when we went."

It might be more helpful if travellers could select one side upstream, and other side downstream, to listen as having to crane way over to the other side of the strait is a challenge.

Oh sure you'll want to head into the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and Topkapi Palace during your trip but you owe it to yourself to get out on the water at least once to see these places from water level. It's actually more fun when you know what these places look like and can pick them out (or have a local do that for you).Beyond the viewing options afforded of the various Mosques and palaces is the fact that the water is quite placid. It is a straight so there is no problem with swell etc for those prone to sea sickness etc.If possible it would be ideal to get out on the water at least twice. Once at night and then once during the day. And before you go to Istanbul make sure you are aware of the Istanbulkart system. Because honestly just getting a normal public ferry across the Strait is a fun exercise and you don't need an expensive fancy tourist boat to get the view!"

Get off, follow the crowd as everyone walks up the hill. Quite steep but take it slow, can easily be done in 45 mins. Walk around the tower, take in the views. Walk down, have some food (we went for the cheapest, cafeteria style local place in the corner rather than the expensive seafood restaurants with people trying to drag you in.)

The first 3km to the Bosphoros bridge is along a path that runs behind the Dolmabahce Sarayi Museum a stunning piece of architecture. Before you reach the Bosphoros bridge their is a cute little wharf called Beskitas which is well worth a stop. About 800mtrs after the Bosphoros bridge you reach a pedestrian walkway right on the water that runs all the way to the Faith Sultan bridge. The whole walk is flat and spectacular. You can walk back or grab a cab. The area between the two bridges is very upmarket with plenty of eating opportunities. A great way to stroll along the Bosphoros and take everything in."

For example you can take a 2 hours cruise boat tour with 15$ or Euro. Even you can take a local ferries that is too cheaper. Moreover, there is an especial cruise boat tour with different hobbies like Arabic dance, live music, free drinks, Turkish dance and finally reception party. It'll take more than 3 hours and only at night. You should pay 40 to 70$ per adult depends on cruise boat that you'll choose. In addition, there is free shuttle service for this boat tour. About clothes, casual clothes or formal clothes, both of them will be suitable, that's your choice. You can have a memorable night and good experience of Bosphorus Strait and great view of Istanbul bridge especially at night. I suggest you take a boat tour and enjoy your time."

Palaces galore, beautifully restored river mansions, castle, galleries, grand university, giant bridges, giant ships, luxury boats galore. DOLPHINS! Hills covered in April blossom, restored fishing villages on the Asian side, where you stop for a simple fish lunch at one of the many toe-in-the-water establishments drinking black tea and water, of course. On board, wrap up if it's not Summer, my fingers went numb in the April sun!"

Having decided to go on a Bosphorus trip, we were warned not to give in to the 'private' boat trip touts on the dockside who would try to sell us 2 hour cruise trips. Instead we brushed them aside and made for the cheaper local ferry up the Bosphorus. We bought a round trip (25Tl each) and assumed we would stay on the boat until we got back to Istanbul (like you do on the Swiss lakes). But no! After 1.5 hours looking at the lovely scenery upstream towards the Black Sea, we were all told to disembark at Anadolu, a sleepy little Asia side Turkish village just after 12pm and it seemed the next ferry back to Istanbul would be at 3pm. There are many small restaurants and eating places by the quay, but we made a leisurely stroll up to the castle ruins and had a light lunch at a small cafe near the castle. Our table had a magnificent view back down river and we were pleased that we hadn't realised that this was such a lengthy trip! In fact, investigating the ticket, we HAD bought a round trip cruise! So be warned - if you are pushed for time, just go with the private cruises and you will be back in 2 hours. As it was we had a most unexpected trip which we joined at 10:30am and were returned to Istanbul at about 4:30pm. There is no commentary on this service, but we had our DK Istanbul guide book with us, so didn't miss much. A highlight of our trip to Istanbul"

You show up at the dock near the Galata Bridge, and the next boat scheduled is docked and ready for boarding. So it's easy to do an impromptu cruise if you are already in the area. However, the boats only go to the second Bosphorous Bridge and although pleasant in good weather, the scenery is mainly the port areas of Istanbul and a few residential areas in the more northern part of the cruise. The 5 hour cruise is therefore recommended, as it goes farther up the strait, and leaves the dock around 10:30 AM."

It's rather hard/weird to review or rate a waterway but there's no doubt that taking the various Bosphorus ferries is a highlight of any break in Istanbul. Firstly there's the long trip up to the north end of the Bosphorus near the Black Sea. I have been using this ferry since 1977 and its changed a fair deal. These days nearly all the punters are people on a day trip be they foreign tourists or locals on a day out. Far fewer people simply using the boat to get from stop to stop. Indeed the 25L fare makes this less attractive although its still very cheap for a day out. The ferry takes about 1.5 hours each way with a stop of nearly three hours. I recommend waking up the steep hill to take lunch at the cafe below the castle. The food is only average but the views over the straight are spectacular. Sip a cold beer and watch the ships glide by.Then there are the short trips [about 15 mins] between various points on the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. Just time to relax with a glass of tea and watch the harbour dolphins. Great way of getting about and it only costs pence particularly with an \"Istanbulkart\".Another cheap trip worth taking is up the Golden Horn to Eyup. This is a bit of a tourist trap around a famous mosque but again the boat ride is interesting. Tends to be packed at weekends.Finally its probably worth mentioning the Princes Islands. More the Sea of Marmara than the Bosphorus but the boat journey starts in the straight. If you want a longish ride [1.5 hours] which is cheaper than the Bosphorus tour then this is just a few TL and although the towns on the islands are a bit touristy you can always go for a walk and enjoy the views. Or else do the tourist bit and take a horse and carriage. Again weekends tend to be busy.All in all Istanbul just wouldn't be Istanbul without the Bosphorus"

I should imagine it is a more pleasant trip on a sunny day. The ferry did not provide much sustenance which would have been helpful on this trip which took over 2 hours. They had packet coffee and cheap biscuits. I was told the ferry was leaving in 10 minutes but we actually waited for approximately 40 minutes before it departed. When we returned, we moored at a different place which left me somewhat disorientated and I got lost returning to my hotel in Serkeci in the pouring rain. other guests at the hotel stated they had a similar experience to mine. It would help tourists if the ferries marked their mooring spots and guided their passengers to prevent this from recurring. There is certainly room for improvement. More comfort on the boat and better snacks and drinks available for the passengers. However, it does offer good views of historical sights and the packed hilltops plus some views of areas filmed in some of the Turkish dramas."

The boat is not fancy.. basically a large ferry... and if you get there early you can get an outside seat. Worth going and really good value. You can also use Jetons (tokens) to get on a regular ferry across to the Asia side, plus there are private companies running trips. We avoided all the vendors selling 'boat tours' and went straight to the public ferry company. There was a longer trip but we did not consider it worth while as it includes 3 hours ashore in a small town for lunch.

You can enjoy the Bosphorus tour which take almost two hours, get your ticket= 12 TL and you can buy your snack from the cruise, there is day trips so you can enjoy the sun and night romantic trips to enjoy the lights of magical Istanbul and the Bosphorus bridges Don't forget to buy Turkish bread to feed the birds."

The Bosphorus boat tour takes about 2- 2.5 hours and fills a wet day well, but be wary about the people selling tickets in the main square. What they do not tell you is that you have to walk - crocodile fashion to the quay side which takes at least 20 mins plus. They do like to cram as many people onto the boats as possible, fortunately for us there was a second boat requested due to numbers.The trip is ok, but the captain needs to realize that when using a microphone , shouting distorts the sound to an level that you cannot understand. The trip does impress just how large Istanbul is ( 12 million), but does tend to get a bit boring after a while.Good for a wet and windy afternoon"

Most people had either small books or audio help (it costs 5TL). It was a sunny day of December 2014. The ferry stopped at many places to let people hop-on hop off. Ninety minutes later, we reached the end of the strait at we landed at a small village full of restaurants. We climbed the hill to overlook the strait. There was a restaurant there and a citadel used by the ancient Turks to watch the entrance/exit of the Black sea.We left the place at 15.00hrs to reach Eminonu at about 17.00 hrsThis small \"trip\" is worth making because it gives an overall look at the many castles, mosques; fortresses... built to glorify and defend the Ottomans against those people of the black sea.

The views along the way (land side) were fabulous, with a lot of action on the water side as we encountered many other vessels (at very near distances). I loved the mansions on the Asian side, which sat in the afternoon sun on the banks of the river. On our way home (after stopping for ice cream on the Asian side), we visited an Island on which stood 'The Maiden's Tower'. All-in-all, I highly recommend taking a boat ride up the Bosphorus River!!

It was great, the guide spoke into a mike and the details were pipped around the boat so where-ever you sat - either inside or on the top deck, you could hear his discriptions and explainations - he was very knoweagble. The buffet catered to almost every taste with hot and cold choices, and a bar served alcohol which was not as expensive as expected, as we know some of these tours where you have to purchase their drinks on-board can be a rip-off. The tour lasts just over 4 1/2 hours, 2 hours cruise down to Anadolu with about a 45 minute stop-over, and then 2 hours back for 45 euro each - we thought this a tad expensive, however the buffet was so large, we had seconds and then didn't want an evening meal that night. I recommend this to anyone as access to the boat is easy to buggies can get on safely and they pick you up and drop back to your hotel."

However, to grasp the history and sights thoroughly, do take a ferry ride. We decided on a 90 minute ride, which was just enough for us. We used the basic Turyol that charged 12 TR per person. Private cruises will advertise narrated tours, but you can get the info you need from any good guidebook that will clearly point out the sites on the map. In our case, the headphones of the person next to us who bought an audio guide would beep up as soon as we pointed out the site using our Lonely Planet Guide. Tip - sit on the right side of the boat - it will back up and turn direction, which will effectively get you on the left side. All Turyol boats hug the left side of the coast both ways providing you close up view of the palaces and grand houses."

Two men were very energetically squeezing fresh oranges and pomegranates to make juice, then brought it around, loudly encouraging everyone to take one. No price list anywhere, and you'd be forgiven for thinking the juice was paid for as part of the trip? Nooooo... and the oranges in February are SOUR. This was our first lesson in Tourist Hospitality - always, always ask 'How Much?' before taking anything offered. Also, there are some quite aggressive map-sellers hanging around the docks, and one poor old dear had money stolen from her bag by one as she was trying to refuse to buy from him! Keep your bag zipped, your face blank, and be ready with a big, angry shout of NO!! when approached by street sellers. They are not official, they are known to be a real nuisance, and the less they sell the sooner they'll stop pestering tourists. In clear and warmer weather, the boat trip is great - the banks of the Bosphorus are lined with elegant palaces and great buildings, and the historical commentary on the boat can be very good indeed."

Walking down one of the longest pedestrian streets in the world (\u0130stiklal Caddesi) one can see beautiful women in mini-skirts next to those who are \"covered\" in traditional garb. Istanbul is unforgettable and Turks are amongst the most hospitable people in the world. It is the rare person who visits Istanbul only once; one is compelled to return to this most fascinating and ancient of cities, where the nightlife is 24-7, and yet reminders of antiquity hold a constant and magical presence. However, perhaps the most emblematic image of this unique modern-yet-ancient city is the waterway that runs through it: the Bosphorus. To see it by day is inspiring; to view it by night is enchanting, when the lights on both sides of the water (European and Asian) shine like luminous beacons and touch the souls, hearts and minds of inhabitants and visitors alike. There is no other city quite like Istanbul."

It surrounds were presented by many visible tourist sights , but the view also gives one some insight into the local life style of the Turks. E.g, They seem to take to fishing a lot in their older years. Many mosques are visible from any vantage point and vary in size and architecture. There are therefore central to each community as some are built on the shore line while others remain iconic structures on top of hills in the distance."

We went when it was winter so it was pretty cold and windy but nevertheless we enjoyed it immensely. The gulls come and sweep crumbs right off the water. You can see the Turkey Asia and Turkey Europe, both of which we were able to explore. You can even arrange private boat tour and dinner cruises. We took a regular ferry boat ride but it was super relaxing to be able to see the sea and click pics!"

It was a beautiful 90 minutes with three stops to the mouth of the Black Sea, then a 20 minute hike up the hill to the ruins of the 2,000 year old Yoros Castle and a wonderful meal at the top overlooking the Bosphorous. The small village of Anadolu Kavagi was so peaceful after the bustle of Istanbul. We took the ferry and not the official Bosphorous Cruise, very relaxed, the stops at small villages are great and it's cheaper."

Ottomans used Topkapi from 1460 to 1850 almost for 400 years. Sultan Abdulmecid (reign 1839-1861) decided to move the palace along the Bosphorus. Because he was in love with the view of the Bosphorus Strait. He built Dolmabahce Palace at 1850s and the royal family moved to there. Then all the important people in the city including authors, poets, high ranking officers, mayors, wealthy people moved to Bosphorus as well. The old city became old fashioned and Bosphorus shores became trendy. We can still observe those houses made by these people during the second half of the 19th century. Some of them are also the most expensive houses in the world.There are two ways to make a Bosphorus trip. There is a government ferry everyday leaving 10:35 from Eminonu Area. (Old city pier right next to Galata Bridge) or you can go to Eminonu sea side and catch one of the private boats leaving almost every hour during the high season. (from april to november)"

Lots of people around Istanbul will try to sell you cruises on their own personal boats. We read that it wasn't advisable, so we stuck to the ferry whose tickets are sold at Eminonu, near the Galata bridge. The time at which the ticket booth opens is usually written on the booth itself; try to get there early because there will be a line. I personally don't recommend renting the tablet guide; it was only for 10 TL but the sound was so low, and the boat was obviously loud (especially if you are sitting on the top deck (which fills up fast; another reason to get there early). Another alternative is spending your time reading the information off the tablet and missing out on the scenery around you. If you are interested in the history behind what you are seeing, then your only choice is the tablet. Try to get a listen before leaving the renting booth, so that you can exchange the tablet/earphones if the sound quality is poor. Also note that there is a cafe on the ferry and the prices are great there. All in all, an enjoyable way to see Istanbul."

If you get the chance do some reading on the sites before you go as the boat I took gave no information on anything. It is well worth the effort and I think an absolute must for any visitor to the city.Okay, these are tips you won't read about in any tourist brochure but I wish someone gave me them before I bought my ticket.You can buy a ticket for the trip from street vendors who peddle tickets near the public ferry terminals. They will tell you that you can take a 2 hour or 4 hour trip. The brochure they give you clearly has 10 Euro for 2 hours and 20 Euro for 4 hours, that's until you buy the ticket and suddenly the 10 Euro is 15 and the 20 Euro is 25.Once you buy your ticket you will be huddled onto a shuttle bus and taken to the boat, you are told the boat leaves every 30 minutes, maybe it does, but it is more like the boat leaves when enough tickets are sold as more and more people are piled on until the owner/captain decide they have enough - we waited nearly 1.5 hours.There is no commentary on the boat, so take a map or do your reading ahead of time or you'll sail past historic sites and have no idea what they are.When the boat returns, don't expect a ride back in the shuttle bus, you have to make your own way back thankfully it is not to far, about a 15 minute walk.If you take the above into consideration, you will have a fabulous time, it's a pity that such a wonderful event can be masked by unscrupulous vendors who are only interested in making a dollar from tourists. The tourist brochure I got listed Gokkusagi Tourism and Mert & M not sure if these are the owners but just be careful of this operator.Definitely go on this cruise - it was wonderful."

The Golden Horn, the Galata Tower, the Sulaymani Mosque, the Blue Mosque, Topcapi palace, and much more over looking the bosphorus strait.

The first tour was at 11.00am, and the cost was 12 Euros. The Turyol tour is on the western side of the Galata bridge. There is another company on the eastern side, with earlier departures and 2 hour tours for the same price, but the boats seemed bigger and older. The bigger boats apparently do not go as close to shore as the smaller ones.A few things to note. There are lots of touts about. We almost went with one, who offered us a tour for 30 Euros (we thought for 2 of us at first, but it was per person). When challenged, he immediately lowered his price to 15 Euros. Just ignore the touts, and walk on and you will see the tour booths.The info booths are not very helpful. The English spoken is a bit poor, and they will just direct you to the boat companies. We could not find public toilets on the pier, and there were decent toilets on the boat we took.When you get on the boat, a man comes around with trays of tea and food. This is not complimentary, although he does not ask for money. He will come around later to ask for money when collecting the tea cups! It's not much - just 1 Euro for a small cup of tea, but not worth the money unless you really want a hot drink. Bring your own flask!The boat ride gives you great views of Istanbul. We went on a rather dreary day, so the photos were not great. But you might need short tele lens if you want to photographs the unless number of mosques and palaces you will see! We grew weary after a while, and the boat ride got a bit monotonous the further up the Bosphorus we went. It was a cold day as well, so sitting on the open upper deck gave good views, but was very cold.Our boat stopped at Uskadar on the way out and on the way back. Seems like it also serves as a ferry to this stop on the Asian side. We got off the boat on the way back at Uskadar, and later took a public ferry - the ferry costs 4 Euros. It's very worthwhile to stop at Uskadar if you want to buy local foodstuffs like teas, dried fruits, helva, olives, honey. Much cheaper in Uskadar than in the main tourist areas in Sultanahmet, Sirkeci, etc. Even the restaurants are cheaper, although still quite touristy. The local \"wet\" market - selling fish, meats etc - is just a short 5 minute walk from the ferry, and you can get decent foreign exchange at a change office there.It's worthwhile to do the boat tour ... but stop on the Asian side to explore."

As Russia's only outlet from the Black Sea it is used constantly by bigger vessels and as a means of livelihood for local fisherman it is also the waterway for small craft. We did not have the time for a long cruise on the Bosphorus but did not want to miss the experience. The weather was cold and very wet so we waited until the very best day we could possibly find in our schedule for the outing. We opted for a two hour cruise and that turned out to be just right for us. We went on a private craft and it was very easy to find a cruise, just go to the dock and you will be approached. We found that the rates were very reasonable. I think we paid about 20TL a piece and we were taken by van and delivered right to the craft. Because of the weather we did not go on top so our pictures aren't the greatest but still fun. Make sure your craft has a snack bar and restroom. Both can come in handy. Our boat had tea being served as part of the price and was brought around several different times. If you have your heart on setting foot in Asia this is not the way for you. The vessel will not stop. Sit on the left of the craft as you face the front and you will have a great view of Europe on the hour down and then Asia on the hour back. We found this to be a great option for those people like us that want to experience the Bosphorus and because of weather or time need to limit there visit. You can also get a fresh fish lunch afterward if you desire. There are stalls and vendors everywhere. Again, the weather drove us away to an inside luncheon."

However it was a very cold and windy day and taking the public ferry would have been a whole day affair - it takes 2+ hours to get to the Asian side, you will spend about 1.5-2 hours waiting for thee return ferry and then another 2 hour ride back. We were initially quoted 15 Euros per person for the private 2 hour tour. My husband tried bargaining and to our surprise we got it for 10 Euros. Later we saw another person bargain it down to 7 Euro. There was an English speaking guide in the boat who gave our information about the monuments along the shore. The first 30 minutes were a lot of fun, but after that it got a bit repetitive for me. And in fact we gave up our vantage point on the deck and came down into the shelter. If you take the public ferry, you can go up to the castle on the Asian side and grab a meal - but the downside is it takes a whole day. Anyway, don't feel like you are missing out on a whole lot if you take the 2 hour ride. If you are pressed for time on a short trip, this is a perfectly decent option."

Highly recommend booking a tour just so for the non-crowded public ferries."

Head to the local ferry docks (Sehir Hatlari) in eminonu and get a tour for 12TL at 2:30 PM, by taking a tour through the Bosphorus you will see the magnificent Dolmabahce Palace, Ciragan Palace, the Bosphorus bridge, Beylerbiye Palace, Rumelli fortress and the 2nd bosphorus bridge. Overall, taking a tour through the Bosphorus is a must if you are in Istanbul"

Ferry rides are cheap, take a tour boat for more information and fasinating history. This is a VERY busy harbour, a great place to see all the different modes of transport, from cruise ships, freighters, fishing boats, ferries, water taxis - similar to busy Hong Kong harbour with a more exotic back drop. Going over the bridge is interesting as well, but you miss the up close and personal feel of the boat ride."

We took a boat cruise along the Bosporus to enjoy seeing Europe and Asia at the same time. Granted, Istanbul culture is on both sides of the straits; however, it is just very unique to see two continents like this.So much history has taken place here in the Bosporus from the early territorial expansion of people from Europe into the Middle East and vice versa to the Moorish Expansion, the Crusades, the expansion of the Byzantine Empire, the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, the Crimean War, both World Wars, and the Cold War. The Bosphorus Straits remain a key waterway today connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. This is a must do while in Istanbul. Just find your way to the docks at the end of Galata Bridge on the Sultanahmet side and catch any of the ferry trips along the Bosphorus. Prices for public ferries are as low as 5-8 Euros while dedicated Bosphorus cruise lines can run upwards of 25 Euros per person."

Along both shorelines are shops, residential buildings and holiday homes peppered here and there with palaces of old. What is evident are the number of towering mosque silhouettes along the skyline.

Take what the locals use to commute between continents and use the Sehir Hatlari ferryboats, especially since these are the most frequent, quickest, and cheapest way to cross the Bosphorus. These ferryboats leave every 15-20 mins from 6:30 am - 10:30 pm and takes 20 mins if you're going from Eminonu on the European side to Uskudar on the Asian side; from Eminonu to Kadikoy (further south on the Asian side), runs every 15-20 mins from 7 am - 8:30 pm and takes 30 mins. Ports north of Eminonu on the European side are Karakoy, Kabatas, and Besiktas, while the Asian ports to the east are Uskudar, Harem, Haydarpasa, and Kadikoy. Simply buy an IstanbulKart from any yellow machine at every tram or metro station for 10 Liras (6 liras for the card and 4 liras in ride credit). Each ride is 2.15 liras, as opposed to 4 liras w/o the card. This is basically a debit card that you can add money to at the same machines so that you merely swipe to enter and ride any bus, tram, metro, or ferry within the city. While crossing the strait, enjoy all the major sites as you see the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque tower over the skyline. A trip on the Bosphorus while in Istanbul is a must because this is the only city in the world that straddles two continents, and riding across the strait allows you to experience both the eastern and western facets of this unique town."

They will point out the highlights and tell you a bit about them. We were happy that we did not do the 4 hour cruise. After the boat ride, we walked over the bridge and continued our touring."

I don't usually get one, but if you take a full 6 hours cruise, you'll need it.The cruise is about 1.5 hours up the Bosphorus, with a few stops along the way, and stops for 3 hours next to some (very uninteresting) Roman ruins. You will get lunch there, walk around, take some pictures, take some more tea, and go back on the boat (you are free to do anything you want there). Then another 1.5 hours down back to Istanbul. Seat on the same side of the ship on the way in and back, this way you can look and learn (with the audio guide) about all places of interest on either side.This is a bit long cruise, but it's the only way to see the other end of the Bosphorus and the Black sea.Cash only."

Yes, it is worth two hours of your day to enjoy the fresh breeze and the beautiful landscape of both continents with a cup of tea. You'll definitely get a much broader perspective of the city and it's surroundings, however there are no live or recorded commentaries on board of the ship.That said, this was the second time I went on a Bosphorus cruise on different boats. Even though I mentioned to the cashier we would like to purchase a 2-hour Bosphorus Cruise return ticket (till the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge), we got tickets for a full day trip (25TL/ person - from 10.35AM till 4.30PM) to Anadolu Kavagi unknowngly. This was a trip leaving at 10.35AM, arriving to Anadolu around 12PM and departing 3h later back to Istanbul. I'm sure it would be a lovely day trip because this charming fishing village, besides many fish restaurants, also had a castle overlooking the Black Sea. Later we found out this is Yoros Castle and it dates back to Phoenicians and Greeks times.As mentioned, it would have been a day trip if we didn't have to drop off one of our friends at the airport 4h later... If you really need to rush back to the city and you can't spend 3h in Anadolu, find the bus stop (2min walk from the ferry) that will take you to Beykoz (1h drive) and from there take the bus #15 to Uskudar (also 1h drive). From there, simply take the ferry to Eminonu and you're back in Istanbul within 2h30."

This trip gives you a perspective on the massive size of the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, and especially the Suleymaniye Mosque.

I love to brag that we were in Europe and Asia in only two hours! Took magnificent photos and learned a great deal of history.

Most of the tourist sites are located alongside or near the Bosphorus and a walk along the riverside is pleasant, especially as you move away from the busier areas and head towards the two bridges. What surprised me was the large amount of people fishing from the riverside. Although most fishermen congregate in certain areas, you're never too far from someone casting a line into the river. This means the riverside is lively and vibrant, even at night.Most important, however, is that it's easy to follow the river. Istanbul can be very confusing to navigate unaided, especially if you leave the main streets, intentionally or not. Find your bearings relative to the river and you'll find it easier to find your way back to your hotel."

The Bosporus Day Tour and The Princes Islands Tour (Which we see that we can not leave our review here, why???). Both Tours were excellent and we thank this travel agency for all. We booked those tours to have also food inside which was an excellent choice as the food was perfect and we got full. It was an open buffet which had the traditional kebab and spicy chicken and many other choices like rice, potatoes, many salads and deeps. The price was the best we found and very reasonable for the things it included. Pick up from your hotel and drop off also. Tour all the way to Bosporus which is something unique and magic as you see all the historic buildings and sightseeing and also unique houses, harbors and many other places on both sides of the area. Also you can see all the bridges that connect Europe and Asia and everything during day light and night. On the Princess Islands tour we had also lunch on the boat which was great and the exploration of the 3 major islands was also very interesting, instead of being pressed from the time on the first island. It is an experience that you must not miss. The only thing that you must be aware of is not to ripped off from the restaurants or cafe shops on the last island. Better ask someone or take a look carefully on the reviews before you choose. Both tours are great and if you are planning to visit Istanbul then you definitely have to put it on your schedule. We also strongly recommend this travel agency for everything. Good, polite and helpful."

We walked straight to their ticket office, paid 12TL per person for a 90 min trip. You don't have to book beforehand as there are a few of the Turyol boats. The boat itself is clean and spacious. You can buy tea, coffee and snacks during the trip and it goes close by the main sites next to the water for beautiful photos.Take a jacket as it can get cold."

You get to see the Rumeli Fortress, built by Mehmet II in 1453 to facilitate his successful conquest of Constantinople, as well as the last palace of the Ottoman sultans - Dolmabahce. In addition to historical and geographic things, you can see two modern suspension bridges: Bosphorus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet II.

My favorite place for a great view of the strait and a great reasonably priced meal to accompany it is 'Ortak\u00f6y'. It houses a beautiful late Ottoman mosque and is very close to the foot of the bosphorus bridge. So, those interested in photography will have a great time there.

Be there 1/2 hour or more early to find ticket booth and wait in line (probably longer in summer). No need to reserve ahead. Don't bother with the audio guide - the equipment is terrible and frustrating. Just read along in whatever guide book you have. When you get to the end, they give you 2.5-3 hours to lunch and explore. Plenty of time to hike to the top to see the amazing view and eat lunch. Sit on the left/west side of the ferry going up and the left/east side of the ferry on return. If it's a nice day, this trip is definitely worth the time, assuming you have at least 4 days in Istanbul. On a 3 day trip or shorter, consider taking the short version or one of the private/faster tours (more expensive)."

This included the real estate prices of some of the properties and the nightlife in Istanbul. The beautiful city must be once viewed from the Bosphorus, it just gives a different perspective.

Big mistake coz it costs us too much at 25 Euros for the both of us.The operators are usually around the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. Only later we knew there is actually a cheaper fee of 12 TL for a similar 2 hour ferry trip and 25TL for the one up to the Black Sea. The only thing is, you will need to go to eminonu to get that service which is about 3 stops away from the sultanahmet tram station. Anyway, the operator that took us , the ferry was reasonably small and tend to rock more when the sea gets choppy as many speedboats and other ships use the same route. The explanation given by the tour guide was also unclear. We just basically enjoyed the given view as it is beautiful. So avoid the blue cruise if possible, if not haggle with them the price because it seems that they give different prices to different people."

As we were exploring Istanbul on the square between the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia we were approached by several people selling such trips. We decided to go with a short tour of approximately 2.5 hours and got a deal of only $10 per person. However, as we were enjoying the walk to the ferry and taking in the sites around us, we failed to notice the crowd that was gathering in front of us to get on the boat. By the time we noticed we were at the back of the crowd and when we finally boarded there were no seats left on the deck. My advice. Definitely take a tour of the Bosphorus but consider paying a little more to take one of the other ferry operations. The pamphlet for the operator that we went with says Grand Boat Line with Goldenhorn. However if you go for the cheaper option as we did make sure to get to the front of the crowd so you are among the first to board, otherwise you will be standing for the duration of the trip."

Also has a fairly manic waiter offering orange juice , toasted sandwiches, Chai (Tea) etc at you seat for a modest price (have change or he just rounds up to the nearest note with a \"tip\"!!) The local ferry operator \u200e\u015eehir Hatlar\u0131 operate similar tours out of Eminonu which also came recommneded and their is also \u200eTurYol boat but cant vouch for them. The tour shows you some splendid castles and buildings generally on both sides of the Bosphorous and goes up European side past second bridge and then back down Asian side. Ideally sit on Left hand side top deck for best views but it is open to weather from sides and can get chilly on poor weather days. Seats are fairly rustic but Ok for a couple of hours. Maybe get off and have lunch at far end and get back on one of next hourly boats back."

We were confused and thought our cruise went for 2 hours but it went all day (this is the 10:35 departure) We were pleasantly surprised at the village where it stopped for lunch and we had a delicious fish BBQ. We walked to the castle- it is quite a steep climb. Glad we spent the day on the Bosphorous - it gave us a good understanding of the area."

From hotels and restaurants high up on the European side, there are fabulous views, particularly at night when the Bosphorous bridge is lit up. I also took the ferries to get around from port to port - very easy. I also did an hour and 15 minute tour of the Bosphorous, which cost about 15 TL, went in a big circle and did not stop at any of the ports. It was perfect for me, as I had limited time and did not want to get off anywhere. Also, 1:15 is probably the longest I could have endured - my stomach got a little queasy from boat fumes and the rolling ferry boat. There is a loudspeaker commentary, which I could not understand, but with a little up front guidebook reading, you will know exactly what you are looking at. Highly recommended."

The ferry was actually more comfortable than the sightseeing boat, and took only 13 minutes between Eminonu and Uskudar. For a \"you can't do this anywhere else in the world\" experience, take the Marmaray train / subway between Sirkeci and Uskudar in four minutes.

I took the day trip (4 hours) with one hour stop in the Asian side, excellent trip I would say, in a comfortable not crowded boat, with great guides doing English, Spanish and Italian narratives of what we were seeing. We stop in a very cozy restaurant to have lunch (not included but well priced and delicious) was very relaxing and gave us a great perspective of the city without dealing with the busy traffic.The second trip, was in the evening. We wanted to see the city from Bosphorus during nighttime, so we took the two hours trip...Horrible to say less...Crowded boat, full of drunk teens, children screaming, not enough seating, did not understand a word of the guide who spoke through a bad microphone from God knows where because never saw the person. Expensive and bad coffee. If you don't like to deal with drunk people screaming in your ears, barfing, swearing, plus children screaming their head off during a boat cruise that suppose to be relaxing and informative, please avoid this tour in the night. Take the longer trip during the day and perhaps do some research about hiring a taxi boat ...But this night 2 hours cruise is a nightmare, it was great I did the other tour, otherwise I will stay with this no good experience as the Bosphorus strait."

An unique experience as the boat travels between the European and Asian parts of Istanbul, including going under two bridges that span the two continents. The cruise is leisurely and, on a nice sunny day, quite relaxing. On the down side, unless you have a guide or have done considerable amount of \"homework\" to research what it is you are seeing, it all becomes somewhat boring. Was it worth it? For me, I'd say \"yes\" as I did have a guide and didn't mind the expense or the time as I see this as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. However, if cost or time is a factor in your travel plans, then giving the cruise a miss is not a big sacrifice."

Watching the activity on both sides of the river was fascinating and there is so much history in Istanbul a short review can't possibly do it justice. If you have the opportunity, take a cruise, see the landscape, learn about the history, see the enormous chain links intended to keep out invading armies centuries ago. What a fascinating place.

You get attacked by vendors and restaurant staff to overpay for below average food. ***Tip, bring your own food and drink and find an area to have your own picnic***.

We did it on our last evening in Istanbul and it brought our whole vacation to a wonderful end. We booked a cruise which included dinner and entertainment. The trip took about 4 hours and the city view at night from the Bosphorous is truly something to behold. We could identify all the places we visited but they looked different at night in coloured lights."

This scenery on both sides gave us a good idea of the nearby surroundings as well as the newer kind of architecture of some of the houses on the Asian side. We also passed some medieval fortresses. The background history regarding the fortresses and how the Turks had used these waterways to their benefit in the past during war times were very informative and interesting. A visit to Istanbul is not finished without a boat trip on the Bosphorus Strait. Highly recommend!"

I couldn't score a decent seat at that time, but ended up sitting on the life vest box on the back of the boat. Which isn't a bad alternative. * Theres no narration, so consider bringing a guidebook or renting an audio tour. I was able to spot most things described in the Lonely Planet. * Its not obvious from the schedule, but this tour includes a ridiculously long lunch stop at a village full of overpriced restaurants with a heavy focus on fish. A lot of us were really confused about how when the boat left, which didn't really help us make the most of our time. (In our case, for the 1035 cruise, the boat left for Istanbul at 300). To break up the monotony, consider hiking up to the castle, though honestly you can't do a lot once you get there."

The first and most important being a boat ride on the Bosphorous Strait. We chose to sit upstairs in the open air (it got very chilly so a warm hat, scarf and jacket is needed) whereupon we were served orange juice and apple tea with a little snack. Our comentator was very informative about all the buildings along the way. We were given an excellent overview of the history of the Bosphorous and what we could see all around us. Going up the strait and under the main crossing bridge, we concentrated on the attractions on the left and turned around to come back so concentrated on the attractions on the other left (Asian side). The say the least the architecture was astounding. Some incredibly intricate and beautiful buildings. Some homes, some palaces, some refurbished Omani residences, some private places. Going up on the first left were some ever so swanky hotels and restaurants with their own piers. Party boats on the Bosphorous are plentiful, stopping off at various venues it looked like. Nightime on the Bosphorous is magical, we arrived back to dock as it was getting dark and all the million twinkly lights on the boats and from the across the water was simply too beautiful to describe. It is worth it if you have time to take a day ride and an evening ride and have dinner on the boat as well. Some have discos going. I would say it is one of the big must do's whilst in Istanbul."

Great views of sights like the Ortakoy Mosque, Rumeli Fortress-(this is the best way to view the Dolambahce Palace, trust me) while you enjoy the cool(er) breezes, and have a soda. Yes, the soda's a bit pricey by Istanbul standards. Deal with it, you didn't take a vacation to pinch pennies, get over it.

Because Istanbul is at the confluence of two continents, this provides the perfect opportunity to see and experience each. If you are going to get a tour, I'd recommend the full day tour as the half day (either morning or afternoon) will miss out. Our tour took us to the Maiden's Tower, Ortakoy, the Rumeli Fortress, and an old Genovese castle overlooking the Black Sea. Along the way, we saw the Topkepi Palace, the Hagia Sophia, the Golden Horn, and the Dolmabahce Palace from the water - all spectacular. Along the way, you can see several Ottoman palaces on the Asian side that you might miss if you stayed in central Istanbul.Though you may find your tour expensive, it's worth it. Even if you have a poor guide or are just crossing on the ferry, take an opportunity to take in the cityscape of Istanbul.Highly recommended."

Use the ferry service, don't bother with private tours, but get there early to get your ticket, and then early again to queue to get on. We were early, by chance, and so glad, as the queue got very long very quickly. Great way to spend a Sat night. The tour leaves from Eminiou, and you get about 2 hrs at a village on the Black Sea for dinner, before returning. Choose your restaurant carefully for dinner. Our fish meal (red mullet) was inedible, and smelled bad. Don't know the name, but it was right on the water. Also got absolutely savaged by sand flies, and the bites left huge red welts which took a week to subside and were very itchy, even with antihistamines. So, probably better to not be right on the water."

If you take a cruise, keep in mind that they don't stop (unless you book a ridiculously expensive one, 30 euros) bring some snacks and drinks (they don't sell beer!).I recommend you simply arrive at the galata bridge (on the side where the spice market is) and check out what the boat options are, there are plenty to choose from, we paid 10 liras each for a two hour trip.

We were warned that the specially marked Bosphorous cruises were over priced and a little to kitch and to try and catch a ferry that locals would use, think Star Ferry over to Kowloon side. We found this in the form of Sehir Hatlari ferries. When coming over the Galata Bridge from Galata, it is the first dock on your left beside the Galata Bridge. 12 TL gets you a return 2-hour cruise and it goes a decent way up past the second large bridge up the Bosphorous. We found this to be ample and enough to see a great vista and taste of Istanbul. We were advised that the full 90-minute each way longer tour is a waste as the town they drop you off at for 3-hours for lunch doesn't warrant a 3-hour stopover, so for time pressed travellers it is a full day away on a cruise. Whereas 2-hours was just enough time for us. We understand that the locals who stand on the harbour and entice you to do a private cruise, have a job to do and probably provide a different standard of service. But we were happy with our cruise. The surprise for us came on the return leg when the ferry docked at Ortakoy, which we didn't know it would and was letting people off. It looked like a nice port and so we too got off. We had wanted to head to the Four Seasons for a drink on the river and knew it was nearby, so it was a great way to round of the day sipping cocktails in their lovely surrounds. Four Seasons is about a 20-minute stroll south. But Ortakoy itself has no shortage of bars and cafes by the water."

At 25 lira for what is at most a boat taxi ride up and down the bosphorous its a little expensive but the ride is nice and it gives good views of some of the palaces that lie on the banks, a 25tl ticket gets you an outbound and return trip regardless of which stop you get off so i recommend staying on the boat until the last stop which is just short of the black sea as it doesn't take too long and has great places to eat."

We went on a 2hr cruise from the New Mosque area up to Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge,just past Rumeli Fortress on the European side & came back along the Asian side. A very well spoken English speaking guide talked throughout the trip, which could be heard all over the boat. There were 2 decks, the lower deck was enclosed & the upper deck open, with a cafeteria as well. The photo opportunities were never ending with all the beautiful palaces, mosques, castles, bridges & grand hotels that we passed. Fantastic views of the Dolmabahce Palace, the Ciragan Palace (now a grand hotel), the Ortakoy Camii Mosque & Rumeli Fortress. Apart from these places there were the most gorgeous river side houses, some of the most expensive real estate in the world!"

We were fortunate to enjoy two such cruises - a morning cruise and an evening dinner dance cruise. Both experiences were memorable. Because of its long history, both sides of the Bosphorus strait are full of immaculate constructions. Beautiful residences coexist with palaces and ultramodern skyscrapers. Because of hilly terrain along the coast, one can see all the marvelous constructions along the entire hillside clearly, while cruising near the shore. The view of beautiful blue water dotted with myriads of cruise boats and ships was spectacular. At night, the view is almost surrealistic, with gleaming light emanating from the buildings. It seemed to me like millions and millions of gems on display along the entire coast. We enjoyed a mild and very pleasant weather during our evening sojourn and soaked in the view from the deck of the cruise boat. I strongly urge my fellow travellers not to miss this experience of cruising on Bosphorus strait."

You can't miss the entrance its under a big shelter by the riverside.

We went up as far as Balat and Besiktas on the European side. Destinations are well displayed. Once you pick your, in most Piers, you will have a booth that will charge you the fare.There is a cruise for 12 TLR that seemed very good too. It takes 90 min and we didn't have that much time hence why we kept using the regular ferryboats but this one also looks like an incredible deal.Once on board, very nice waiters offer tea, sandwiches, etc. You also have a bar with larger selection in case you are hungry/thirsty. Be aware of the waves if you are on the lower deck outside. You might get a bit of a splash."

Istanbul strait is a 31 km long large natural seawater passage between Black Sea and Marmara Sea dividing Istanbul into two major districts...European istanbul and Asian Istanbul....yes , this strait has two continents each side. Both fronts, face from Europe and Asia, set up wonderful valley-like views very enjojable from each face and from the sea on the boat. There are multiple alternatives to take a boat cruise on the Bosphorus...but I suggest you go Ortakoy at first, take a free walk all around Ortakoy. Cafes, restaurants, street sellers selling unique handmade ornaments and bijouteries...silver and bead necklaces , bracelets and so on... Then you can visit one of the most beatiful mosque of. Istanbul located on the seaside on Bosphorus. You can also visit a church, and a sinagog in only 50 meter proximity of this mosque. After your Ortakoy walking trip, I suggest you take the short boat cruise tour departing just other side of the mosque. They start every 15 minutes. Boat departs from Ortakoy, sails northward by very close to seaside of European front , returns after passing second suspension bridge (Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridge) and follows seaside of Asian front. It takes 2 hours to see those wonderful facades of two continents facing Bosphorus. The boats are large tour boats at size of 100 to 200 people and don't worry they are safe.I have taken too many of those Bosphorus tours as a local of Istanbul. But if you are visiting Istanbul and have limited time, I recommend Ortakoy for both walk around and taking a boat cruise.Those tours are good for family with children, singles, couples and group of friends."

Stunning views, surprisingly good food for lunch."

If that's the case, you need to jump on one of the boats doing a trip up the Bosphorus. It really is a nice relaxing trip and you'll get to see the city of Istanbul from a whole new prospective.There are several boat trip, depending on how much time, or money you want to spend. One of the basic trips, and one of the best, is a 1.5 hour trip up the Strait to the second Bridge....as a San Franciscan it's emotionally difficult to see how the Turks have stolen the concept of the Golden Gate Bridge...not once, but twice <gasp> OK, so once you get close to it, you realize it has nothing on the GGB, it's just another knock off.On the quicky tour you still get to land on the Asian side, and have a commentary, in English, during the trip. It's definitely worth doing."

It was most enjoyable. We met at a location in from of the Blue Mosque and then were escorted \"crocodile style\" down to get on the boat. The salesman had said it was \"a two minute walk, just 200 metres\" and this was a huge understatement. The pace is fairly fast, all downhill but it is 7-10 minutes' walk and being of mature years, it was a bit of a frog march for me. Not suitable if you are infirm as getting on the boat can be a bit tricky as well as the walk to get to the boat in the first place. There are other boat trips which might be more suitable.The commentary was informative but not constant, which was good. There were toilets and a bar on board and it was sunny but a bit windy and chilly on the return journey so you may like to take a jacket. There were wonderful views of many palaces and we went up as far as the second bridge and returned down the Asian side. We also had a brief trip up the Gold Horn. Well worth the money."

Far away from the crowd, from standing at queues, from walking and walking and walking :) If you got time, I suggest you go for one cruise in the evening (departure at 8 pm) and one during the day (when the sun is up). Because it feels and looks different. Trust me. Not to say, that from 8 pm the cruise boat is not so crowded as during the day and you feel more charmed. During the day you can see the luxurious villas on the waterfront (luxurious, but with good taste), the Dolmabahce Palace, the Bosphorus Bridge...and all the waterfront details you can't see after sunset. During the evening, it's magic time! All the buildings are highlighted and you can even spot Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia. Tips:- if you go for the day cruise and it is a sunny day, it means that a lot of people will do the same. So please get on the boat as soon as you can, around 30-20 minutes before, because otherwise you won't get a good view. - we took the tour with a boat company (can't remember the name, although they have many boats) that is on the Eminonu side of Galata Bridge (Sultanahmet shore, looking at Sultanahmet, on the right), next to the fish sandwiches. - it costs 12 LT per ticket, 1,5 h tour (at the company we were with)- we didn't get the tours from the Ferry Company because they have fewer hours available and in May they don't do evening tours.- on the evening tour it gets very chilly so get an extra shirt or jacket.- they have tea and juice on board"

It was a nice start to our trip. We used Sehir Hatlari - it's very cheap (much cheaper than some of the others) and the map and audio guide are perfect. It is the last boat company on the waterfront in Eminonu, nearest the bridge across the Golden Horn - basically opposite new mosque. I wouldn't say any of the sights are specular - but it's a good way to just sit back and relax if you aren't up to anything more strenuous."

Nice pleasant experience and it is not very expensive at 15 TL (for the short 1.5-2 hour cruise). Try taking the tickets from the good/recommended cruise companies at the ferry terminals or from \u015eehir Hatlar\u0131, the official ferry company and avoid the agents who try to sell you the cruise tickets at other major tourist attractions or near the ferry terminals.So many walks along the different parts of the strait is also a great experience with its views, atmosphere, the suspension bridges (great view at night) and the historic sites. Have food from any of the good restaurants and cafes and just enjoy the evening hustle bustle and the breeze.A normal ferry ride like a Istanbul resident is also a great experience and pretty cheap too."

We had a three hour tour that showed the highlights of the Golden Horn and Bosphorous. The price on leaflet was \u20ac15 pp but we got tickets for \u20ac11 pp. Bad points:There are loads of ticket sellers operating who then bring all of their customers together. We then had a ridiculous 30 mins of swarming around in a huge crowd being led / then waiting / led / then waiting again. This culminated a small dodgy looking pier with no boat. Then the boat came in but clearly did not have enough room for the massed throng. There was quite a bit of pushing and shoving which was not fun to be part of.Good points:The second boat came along soon after and everyone got on a boatThe boats were quite modern and in good orderThe English speaking guide was very goodThere was a toilet Food and drinks were availableThe cruise was wonderful - a very good length, great for photographySaw many Yelkouan Shearwaters flying along the BosphorusPoints to remember:However warm and sunny it is in the city it will always be significantly colder on the water - not too much of a problem when cruising with the wind, but then very noticeable when cruising against it. Most people wanted to be on the top floor which gave the best views and was open - however in the open you have two major risks sunburn and cold. Always wear/have available a number of thin layers that can be added and removed accordingly, a hat (that wont blow off in wind that can be stronger than you expect) and sun block lotion.You may want to consider the main ferry terminal which has similar ferry rides (and indeed much longer trips out to the beautiful looking islands) for much lower prices.Finally you will never see many of the wonderful views of great buildings and city any other way than this type of cruise. Bring your camera!!"

A walk up an enormous hill to a castle was well worth it with a panoramic vista revealed looking north. A great experience!

I think it costs about 10 TL each, which you can buy right at the terminal at Eminonu. Others sell them for more.Once you get your sea legs you soon discover many cheaper public ferry alternatives to exploring all the waterways of this great city, but if time is short I would recommend this.

Although the village has mostly touristy fish restaurants, it was still nice to be in a more peaceful small-town atmosphere for a day. We first hiked up to the ruined castle above the town (very steep but good exercise and great views), and we had lunch after that. The 3 hours between sailings was plenty of time for both a hike and lunch. Highly recommended, even if you only have a few days in Istanbul!"

As well as superb views of the city, we also saw beautiful imperial palaces, mansions perched on the water\u2019s edge, fortresses and traditional Ottoman wooden houses. Really beautiful out on the water and offers a different perspective of Istanbul.We took an afternoon cruise, booked through Viator \u201cBosphorus Cruise and Istanbul's Egyptian Bazaar\u201d. It also included a trip to the Spice or Egyptian Bazaar which was a great added bonus. We got picked up and dropped off to our hotel, had a great friendly English speaking guide and spent around four hours on the tour in total, half of that time on the water. We felt it was good value for money considering what we got to see. Great way to spend an afternoon."

I took the tram from my hotel near the Blue Mosque to the Eminonu stop. I walked across the street to the ferry terminals and turned left. There is a large terminal near the Galata Bridge that sells full day Bosphorus cruises for 25 liras roundtrip. Audioguides are an additional 10 liras. The company's name is Sehir Hatlari. Since I cruised in January, there was only one departure time (10:30am). I arrived about an hour early, but I could have waited until about 15 minutes prior to departure to buy my ticket. There was not a very large crowd on a cool Monday morning in January.The cruise takes about 1 1/2 hours to reach the last stop Anadolu Kavagi. I sat outside on the boat and it was quite chilly, but it was worth it. The view was wonderful. You can see so many things from the Bosphorus that you would miss if you only traveled on land. After arriving in Anadolu, I walked/hiked up to the castle ruins. There is not very much to see once up there. The view is nice, but there is nothing else to do other than eat. I ate lunch at a restaurant in the town then returned to the ferry for the 3pm departure. The afternoon brought sun and slightly warmer temperatures making the seating outside on the ship more bearable.Overall, this cruise was money well spent and the highlight of this visit to Istanbul. This was my second visit to Istanbul, so I was looking for something to do away from the Old Town area. I would recommend this cruise to visitors to the city. Try to make time to do it."

Instead we went for the state-owned \u015eehir Hatlar company 2 hour cruise at 2pm (December), to just beyond the second Bosphorous Bridge and back. We were outside on the back deck all the time, wrapped up and not at all cold, having waited in line for 30 mins. before departing: the only minus were those later arrival passengers who then pushed in front of the seats we managed to get, and seemingly oblivious to (or ignoring) that fact that they were blocking our view. But it happens everywhere \u2013 best to recognise that if you want a view, the seats at the back are of no real use at all \u2013 the exception are the outboard end of the seats down the sides of the boat, where no one can stand in front of you.We didn\u2019t hire the audio commentary guide, as we had a good guidebook, but others may wish to \u2013 you do this immediately inside the admission barrier just before getting on the boat, although that might mean you miss the best seats in the rush of those bypassing the audio rental booth.Very good value, and a great way to understand the geography of Istanbul."

During the trip you can see all the nice houses across the Bosphorus. In anadolu you can stay in the village to eat some fish in the restaurants or you can climb the hill to the 14th century castle.

It was late on a Sunday afternoon when we boarded our cruise boat from the unusual boarding station, located in the grounds of a Customs depot, not far from the port of Istanbul. The cruise took us through the heart of Istanbul and travelled a few kilometres in the direction of the Black Sea and under some major road and railway bridges, before turning and heading back to the starting point. There were a number of very interesting sights to be seen but the most fascinating part of the cruise was to be on a waterway which separated the two continents of Europe and Asia, with both continents clearly visible on either side of the boat. The onboard guide provided an interesting and entertaining commentary as we travelled up and down the waterway.The aforementioned were the highlights of this short cruise. Unfortunately there also some lowlights. As we set off from the quay, the onboard guide attempted to go through the safety briefing. His attempt to demonstrate how to put on a life-jacket in case we needed to evacuate the boat was laughable because he had no idea what he was doing. The boat had two decks and as we boarded, we were ushered along with most other passengers, to the upper deck. This was fine in that you were provided with a good vantage point, to take in all of the views but there was no shade of any type and the sun was quite strong. There was also a problem with the diesel exhaust smoke from the boat's funnel constantly blowing over us and at times during the cruise, this became quite unpleasant. As part of the tour deal, all passengers were entitled to either a free soft drink or an orange juice during the cruise. If you wanted a beer, a wine or spirit, you had to purchase them from the onboard bar. Unfortunately when the crew members brought around the complimentary drinks, they were warm and the soft drinks were flat - hardly refreshing.In summary, the highlights outweighed the lowlights. It is certainly worth taking a sight- seeing cruise on the Bosphorus, to take in the views of Istanbul from a unique viewpoint."

We took a sunset ferry from the European side along the Bosphorous, going we stayed close to the European side, went under the bridge connecting the 2 continents and returning we past the asian side, seeing the glamouous yallis.The driver of the boat played local disco istanbul music which was strange. But it went well with the video we were capturing. we also took the water taxi (public ferry) when going to Princes island on the last day. Took a horse ride round the island, as no motor vehicles are allowed there. It's cheaper to use the public ferry than the cruise ferries, but check their timings. It's amazing to see the locals come to the mainland for all their shopping and then return by the last ferry back to the islands."

The best way to enjoy it is to catch a boat and cruise along it taking in the views from both sides namely Europe and Asia. You can catch one of the city liner boats leaving from Eminonu (but these are just a few times during the day) or hop on a smaller boat leaving Ortak\u00f6y these are much more frequent but only run during high season that is May thru September."

They leave you here for a couple of hours before the return journey. There's a short, steep walk up to a ruined 14th century fortress, which has good views, but you can't get near the building, which is fenced off. Other than that, there are some tourist stalls and a lot of simple fish restaurants and ice cream sellers. The fish lunch by the water was good and fresh, but the town felt pretty artificial. It might have been more fun to stop at one of the bigger towns on the way, and one of the tourist cruises might be just as enjoyable, depending on what you want out of the trip.The public ferry was definitely a tourist boat, rather than a trip for locals (it was a public holiday when we went and there were only foreign tourists on board).If you want to see all the riverside houses and palaces, I guess any of the boats will be as good - you can get an audio/headphone guide on the ferry.Oh, and remember to take loo roll on the ferry!"

A coach took us to the ferry departure point. The cruise itself was about 1.5hrs long.Travelling along the Bosphorus Strait will certainly give you a view of Istanbul that is not accessible from land. Taking a good tour guide will certainly enable you to gain a much more detailed understanding of the significance and history of key building as you pass them. The only downside is the cost of these guided tours when you compare them to the price of the ferry ticket purchased on its own. In theory you could take a public ferry on your own at a fraction of the cost. The tour guide agency appear to add a significant mark-up to the price."

The trip was a wonderful experience but a few pointers worth noting:at this time of year (Autumn) there is only one boat leaving from Eminono per day and that is at 10.35 am sharp. Best to be there no later than 10.00 in order to get a good seat. Cost is TL25.00 return.Secondly, the final destination, Anadolu, where the ferry stops for 3 hours is a bit of an anti-climax. It is very touristy with many so-called fish restaurants who serve up rather pricy but really standard fare. Our choice would have been to hop off at the 3rd last stop (number 6 on the guide) called Sanyer (?), a lovely looking place although without the view of the Black Sea that Anadolu may offer. The ferry trip is far more comprehensive than the other so-called Bosphorus tours that only take you as far as the second bridge. Oh and be sureto take along something warm, especially at this time of the year as it gets really chilly on the water."

On the second stop on the Asian side you will see a huge seafront restaurant, right on the water at the small harbor, its a cool place run by the police, and its open to the public.... it was just fab.PUBLIC FERRYthe public ferry is really cheap about 1 euro ,or 3 TL, it is a single journey for east to west, you but your ticket from a machine, and it gives you a red token that allows you through the turnstile barriers onto the ferry,,,we did both trips and both were fun.....the ferry gives a sense of reality and the tour gives the history etc either way or both, you have got to do this.oh the shops are cheaper on the asia side....if you see a shop D and P selling perfume buy some, really top quality at 10euro a bottle."

Having disembarked at the Black Sea entrance, in Asia, do not succumb to the entreaties of energetic restaurant PR men, but walk for two minutes and get on the local bus running down the coast (Istanbul travel card works for payment) and get off at Kanlica, a pretty fishing village with some rather splendid high-gated villas on the outskirts and a delightful Sinan mosque.

To participate in a tour on a larger vessel purchase tickets from the ticket offices near Galata Bridge rather than vendors with signs - this will also ensure a seaworthy boat. The tour I attended did not announce or point out any attractions - it was very enjoyable by more like a ferry ride than a tour. So, read up on the attractions beforehand, follow along on the free maps available at the ticket office, or pay for the audio guide. I did the second. Bring binoculars for a chance to spot porpoises and seabirds (i saw both) and bring a sweater or jacket. Even a hot day in the city can be very cold on the water. The muze pass also gets you discounts with some companies so ask when buying your tickets."

These boats are magical, and everything you see from them seems to sparkle as you pass. You don't need to be going somewhere, just take in the view before you, sip the tea that's just been poured for you, listen to the musicians playing in the background and then start feeling sad that you're not at work.

This cruise allows us a glimpse of both the European and Asian side of Istanbul with some historical sightseeing spots along the strait. After reading the various options of taking the cruise, we decided to take the advice to stay clear of the private tours and take the Full Bosphorus Tour with the traditional Sehir Hatlari ferry boat. The cruise was inexpensive, cost TL25 per person, from Eminonu to Anadolu Kavagi (a fishing village) on the Asia shore and back to Eminonu. The 6 hour cruise included a 3 hour stop at Anadolu Kavagi (the stop is a must if you take the full day cruise). During the stop at the fishing village, we first hiked to the Fortress (the walk is quite short about 20mins but certain stage can be quite a tiring climb), enjoyed the view of the Black Sea. Although there are many restaurants by the shore, we decided to have our lunch at the hill top restaurant to soak in the wonderful view. We then had our coffee and dessert at one of the cafes by the waterfront before boarding the ferryboat. What an unforgettable Bosphorus tour! We were glad we set aside the day to take the full day cruise!"

The staff treated me like royalty-- beverages, food, and kindness. I learned much about both the historic areas on the straits as well as the new architecture. It is gorgeous! I now understand why the real estate on the Bosphorous is so high. Magical!"

There are quite a few boats that go up and down the Boshorus, and it is a really nice way to get off your feet for a few hours and enjoy cruising up the strait. These don't make it all the way to the Black Sea, but the views from the strait itself, as well as the sites along the way, make this an enjoyable outing. Avoid the guys at the mosques trying to sell you tickets and just go the piers by the pedestrian bridge across the horn and you'll be able to get a ticket easily."

It moves at a lovely leisurely pace passing all the wonderous sights that the Bosphorus has to offer. During winter there is only one trip per day leaving at 10.35am but you want to be sure to be there at least 45 minutes early in order to secure a good seat, I recommend the outside seats on the top deck. The trip takes about an hour and a half in each direction and allows you a nearly three hour stay in the delightful village of Anadolu Kavagi where restaurants, coffee shops, ice cream and souvenirs await you. I predict that you will end up thinking that this trip was the best \u00a38 you can spend in Istanbul, the hawkers trips only go as far as the bridge and cost nearly \u00a325."

Wonderful picture opportunities. Or enjoy the hustle and bustle on the strait. Enjoy the asian side for some time (food and drinks much cheaper than on the european side) and take a ferry back.

Forget the over-priced candle-lit Bosphorus Cruises - just take a ferry across to the Asian side from Kabatas or better still take the Princes Islands trip - that's terrific, though I'm told the islands are hideously busy in peak season.

There were a lot of people and so not use to rubbing elbows for the whole trip. I bought an audio guide but it was so noisy on the boat that I couldn't hear what was being said. The places being pointed out by the audio guide had gone past prior to being mentioned. So save your 10 TL and just admire the scenery. When we got to Anadolu Kavagi we thought we would eat first then walk up to the castle. That was an experience. All restaurants want your business as tourists are their business. Be prepared to be persuaded into a restaurant. A word to the wise, not sure about all restaurants but the one we went to charged us for things we didn't intend to order and wanted to charge a different price then was quoted. My suggestion is if you want to see the castle - go to it first as there are places to eat at the base of the castle. A steep walk up but worth it for the view"

We took 2 different ferry trips, not sure where we went to but we had a view of the skyline on the way back, it only cost 3TL each way for about an hours round trip so not bad, we had a cup of tea on board, Turkish prices not tourist prices, if you just want to see a little bit of Istanbul from a distance well worth a ferry trip"

The tour guide was good and pointed out various monuments along the cruise. Its a great idea to carry your camera and zoom lens when you go for the cruise. On a slightly cold and chilly day, please carry and extra layer - its really windy on the boat, even if it is sunny."

You can get on a public ferry at Eminonu, and it crisscrosses the Bosphorus between Europe & Asian side. It'll reach Anadolu Kavagi is about 1.5 hour, makes a stop about 3 hours, before heading back to Istanbul. Enough time in Anadolu Kavagi, to have lunch (fish is cheap there) and visit the fort, on top of the hill. Taking the public ferry is definitely cheaper, than taking a tour package. The view along Bosphorus is also amazing."

For this, you will need to go through a tour operator. Dime a dozen available on Divan Yolu (main street with the tram line), or just ask your hotel reception (mind the hidden commission). There are three options available. Would definitely recommend that you do any one of them.1. A quick 2-hour cruise, where you don\u2019t get off the boat. It just takes you along the coastline and the guide explains all about Istanbul\u2019s history and the different monuments. There are about 3 departures in a day \u2013 2 pm, 4.30 pm and 7 pm. You will be approached by numerous people as you walk down the Ayasofya area offering you the cruise. Most of them are pretty safe and are offering you the same cruise. Negotiate well with them. We managed to get it for 20 Euros (or 55 TL) for two persons. With some luck, you can manage 45-50 TL as well. More than anything, this gave us a good history lesson of Istanbul, with the guide explaining everything. 2. A half-day cruise. You will be picked up and dropped at the hotel. Different tour operators will offer different itineraries. Pick the one you like. If it\u2019s a day cruise, would recommend the one that lets you get off the boat and explore the Dolmabah\u00e7e palace. Cost was listed at between 35-45 Euros per person. Possibly negotiable. Lunch may not be included. If it\u2019s an evening cruise, they will probably not let you get off. It will have a belly-dance, other performances along with dinner and drinks. Cost is likely to be higher \u2013 around 90-100 Euros per person.3. Full-day cruise. Pick up from and drop back to hotel. They cover a few things on the Asian side of Istanbul as well. Do it only if you are spending many days in Istanbul and are really interested in the sights they show. Cost is around 80-90 Euros per head. Lunch included. "

There was a shortage of plastic bags, and there were no bridges over the Bosphorus. So, much has changed. But the most fun way to travel between the European and the Asian parts of Istanbul is still the same. Just fascinating to watch all the activities while one is crossing the water. And using the public boats is cheap, just 3 TL per passage, that's about one and a half US$."

I took a cruise in the early evening which enabled me to see half of the strait during daylight and then the Bosphorus bridge and the rest of Istanbul lit up at night. It got a little chilly later on so I'm glad I took some warm clothing. There was a tour guide and he spoke with some of the passengers after his talk; he said he really appreciated people asking him questions as it reassured him that people were actually listening but also because he enjoys talking about his country, he was really approachable. There was an initial surge of tourists attempting to take pictures of everything the guide highlighted but this soon stopped and everyone seemed to relax (especially after indulging in the beer and snacks on sale). This is such a great way to spend a few hours and appreciate the special, vast and amazing landscape of Istanbul."

I was a bit disappointed as you really can't see much after sunset. Then it's just a long boat ride. So definitely do a day trip and ensure you get commentary about what you are seeing. There is so much history here. You will see the main tourist attractions from the water, which is beautiful, and you can see the locals fishing, swimming, and picnicking on the weekends along the banks. If you walk along the banks, you can find all sorts of vendors- food, souvenirs, shooting at balloon games. It's a great place to watch people."

Except for the Galata Bridge area, the area is not over-populated with intrusive tourist shops."

Take the cruise only which takes around an hour or a little more. You'll pass the old city walls, ancient palaces, universities, 5 star hotels, forests, go under the bridge and all the way to the end where the boat makes a u-turn and then you start seeing the Asian side.The cable card ride is something that is not worth the time nor effort as you're bused to the cable car location and the escalators are broken so you wait in line over an hour in the heat to take the ride that lasts about 10 seconds. This was organized by She Tours through Forever Tours, a big mistake. We didn't know it was She Tours until the end of the tour and hadn't booked with them because of their low rating on Trip advisor. we went with the highly rated Forever tours and. Ugh to our dismay they turned our trip into she Tours. Grrrrrr"

Get tickets and board at the ferry terminal closest to the Galata Bridge at Eminonu. Good to be there about 9:30 am for the 10:30 departure so you can get good seats outside under the roof near the edge for best views. You get to see some incredible scenery including historic fortresses, fishing villages, pa;aces, and upscale residences in one of the legendary places in the world. You are following in the wake of Jason and Argonauts, after all! At the last stop in Anadolu Kavagi, the ferry lets you off for about 3 hours. You should, if you're physically able, walk up to the fortress to get a great view of the Black Sea and ships moving up and down the Bosphorus. There are lots of restaurants on the way up the hill and near the ferry terminal."

The trip up is interesting but after a while gets a bit samey. Stand-outs are the bridges. Also be prepared to share your journey with some pretty rude people who stand in front of you and push you out of the way to take photos of essentially nothing.The stand-out was being ripped off by a restaurant in Anadolu Kavigi called the Godze.We chose the place because it was the only that we could see that seemed to have toilets (they were filthy according to my wife).Now here's way the scams come. After walking around to find somewhere to eat we found that all the restaurants have very vague menus. At the Godze we were given a price of 70 TLR for a Sea Bass for 2 people which is pricey but we were in a holiday mood. Be aware that the price they charge is by weight. So be sure that they weigh anything in front of you. Other scams include:They give you bottled water when you sit down (very nice after we heard about the tap water being dangerous)They give you bread before the meal.They charge for these without telling you when they bring them. So ask them to take it away if it is not free. Also we were charged for the bread and water which were taken away from the table before we had finished them. We also saw the bread remaining from our table being placed into another basket which we assume was being given to someone else.My wife wanted a glass of wine. She got a nice glass and we got charged for the whole bottle but never saw the rest of the bottle.And they added a 10% service charge to the bill!!!!!! This is the first time I've seen this done in Istanbul.All up A salad - we asked for one serving and got a large salad that could have served four people and were charged accordinglyFried battered mussels - one servingA meze of seaweedA seabass ( just a sea bass)A glass of wine3 beers (33ml)2 people 190 TLR !!!!! Avoid AK at all cost.Also if you have limited time the whole trip takes from 10:30 to 4:30 with 3 hours break to be ripped off.The journey back is the same scenery only going another way. BTW the WCs on the boat are the Asian kind but at the least the boat is pretty stable. Sorry if this review is dripping in bile but the restaurants in AK know that being week day trippers and obviously tourists they'll never see you again so they make hay while the suckers are in town.That aside Istanbul has been great, the people are really friendly and the food is reasonably priced especially in the New District."

Do not be enticed by the many over-zealous salesman all around Istanbul selling Bosphorous cruises to tourists. These cruises are an overpriced tourist trap. Instead head down to Eminou and beside the Galata bridge you will find the a ferry terminal that sells the tickets for 10 Lira (3 euro).

From 1 July until 21 August, every Saturday you can make a nightly cruise on the Bosphorus. The ferry heads for the Black Sea just before the sun starts to set. Once in Anadolu Kava\u011f\u0131, you have 70 minutes to go ashore and enjoy a dinner in one of the many fish restaurants.By the time you board the ferry again, darkness has fallen and you\u2019ll enjoy the Bosphorus by night, in all its grace with nicely lit monuments and a variety of city lights, including the Bosphorus Bridge. So, for a mere TL 20 return ticket you get to see both shapes of the Bosphorus in one cruise. the live music in the boat keep ..you entertained..don't forget to pack a jacket as it may get cold in the way back.."

It was great and clean boat with bathroom facilities on it. The cruise was long 1.5 \u2013 2 hours. We loved it. It is nice to see Istanbul from water and enjoy the views along the shore of both continents."

The view is amazing - seeing the historical district, the Europe side and Anatolia side from the sea is really breathtaking. The time passes so quickly that I really don't mind the ride to be longer. It totally worth the time, and the effort to search for a reliable boat operator.I actually hopped onto a boat the night before when I was strolling along the eminomu waterfront near Galata bridge. There was a boat operator charging 10 TL for 1 hour non-stop ride and said the trip would start at 9pm (it was around 8:40pm then). Since the official boat has already closed for the day, I decided to give this operator a try. But I waited and waited, and the boat was still there when it was already 9:20pm. When asked, the operator said they will only depart at 9:30pm because they have not filled up the boat. I was really pissed and demanded the money back.The next morning, I tried another operator, TurYol, 1.5 hours for 12 TL. To my surprise, the boat departed on time even though it was almost empty. It cruised along the bosphorus straits for a solid 1.5 hours and passed two bridges. The boat is quite big and relatively modern comparing to other boats. The reliable service and comfortable ride definitely made the entire trip more enjoyable.I found the following website extremely useful. I only used it for Bosphorus Cruise on my last day in the city. But if I have come across it earlier, I would use it for other sightseeing in Istanbul.http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/go/Istanbul/Sights/Bosphorus/BosphorusCruise.htmlI have attached a photo of the first boat operator. Given a chance, I would strongly recommend you to avoid it."

These can be diverting, but won't offer the rewards of visiting the small communities that dot the shores on either side. The local ferry system is very economical and quite easy to use once you get the hang of it. It's remarkable how few tourists use the ferries or visit the towns along the shore, so you will have much more contact with the inhabitants, as well as more freedom to get off and explore. Each town has an interesting feature, some historical, some functional. Bring a good guide book and you can read about the towns as you approach them and select the ones to explore that appeal to you most. You will also get an excellent opportunity to watch the busy shipping traffic and the many small fishermen in boats or along the shore. This is worth a full day. Check the weather reports to make sure you pick one with good weather, which makes it even more enjoyable."

All along the way she told us about the rich history of the city as she pointed out various landmarks. When we docked back on the Golden Horn, we had a clear understanding of how the city is laid out and a general sense of how it evolved historically. I can't speak for what one learns on the organized tour boats, but on a clear day with a good guidebook I suspect it is also a worthwhile orientation."

The climb to Yoros Castle takes about 15 minutes, but the views are spectacular from the top and there are some cafes along the way. After visiting the castle you can either take the ferry back (same price, or you can buy a return for 25 TL) or you can take the 15A bus to Kanlica, then transfer to another bus which will take you to Uskudar, on the Asian side of Istanbul, where you can take one of the many ferries back to the European side. We chose to take the bus, as it allowed us to see a bit more of Istanbul. If you purchase an Istanbulkart, you can use it for the buses on the Asian side and the city ferries to return to the European side. It can also be used for the city buses, trams, metro, and the Golden Horn ferries."

Beautiful palaces & homes dot the shores. Interesting how the freighters have to alternate their travel through the Bosphorus due to the narrow passage.

It was worth the trip just to say we saw the Black Sea. The boat itself was very relaxing and there was good scenery the whole way up and back. My favorite were the large houses that were built on the water with their own docks and fancy swimming pools. Also, we went during the protests in Taksim Square, so this was the only way that we got to see some attractions such as Dolmabahce Palace. I would recommend that you be one of the first to buy your tickets in the morning, then stand in line to get on the boat so that you can sit on the sides of the boat for the best views."

After a tour of around 2 hrs we reach the fortress at the connection of Black sea. It is at this point wherein you see bhosphorus joining the black sea. The view from the fortress is panoramic. We saw lots of Russian oil tankers passing through the bhosphorus strait. One can also realized the strategic importance bhosphorus strait has played in the history of Turkey and Ottoman Empire. It is an important route connecting ports in Russia, Romania and Bulgaria. One can see lots of Turkish flags at the shore while you are on the cruise. There are two bridges build over the Bhosphorus strait which is an example of amazing engineering work. This excursion where in one actually travels between Asia and Europe are highly recommended whenever one visits Istanbul. The cruise is having a capacity of around 200 passengers. There are also televisions installed inside the cabins which will show Turkish news channels with English subtitles. Tea and snacks are served onboard. Anadolu kavagi is a small fishing village where the cruise stops for an hour or two. After touring the small village we had our lunch and boarded the ferry back to Eminonu.Bosphorus strait cruise is something one should not miss when in Istanbul"

Avoid the sales people who sell you expensive and short trips along the first part of the Strait (that is unless you are very short for time). Its better to take the local ferry The most popular way to explore the Bosphorus is by ferry at Eminonu from the Bo\u011faz Hatt\u0131 dock (dock No 3) daily at 10.35am. From June to Sept there are other sailings - best to check. The ferry stops at a number of stops along the way finishing at Anadolu Kava\u011f\u0131 where you can get off, have a fresh fish lunch and then come back on the same boat. You can't get on and off the ferry along the way using the same ticket (like you would on a hop on hop off service). The boats fill up early in summer \u2013 especially on weekends \u2013 so its a good idea to buy your ticket and get aboard at least 45 minutes prior to departure to get a seat outside or next to a window. During the trip waiters will offer you fresh orange juice, tea and other drinks. At one of the stops they bring aboard fresh yoghurt from Kanlica. Its a must try. You can also go only as far as Sar\u0131yer, on the European shore. Then make your way back to the city on the bus, stopping at Emirgan and Rumeli Hisar\u0131 on the return trip; its also possible to get off the bus at Ortak\u00f6y , \u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace or Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace on the return trip."

The fish restaurants which abound at the final destination, we avoided and instead climbed up to the castle - a short, fairly steep climb with somewhat hazy views from the top.

After reading the Trip Advisor reviews, it seemed clear that the Bosphorus cruise can be a minefield, typically including slow coach rides to and from your hotel, followed by unadvertised stops at leather shops etc, a high price in the 35-45 Euro range and an indifferent guide commentary; so a 2-3 hour cruise actually ends up taking rather more than half your day and not being that good. Here's how to do it without these problems. First make your own way to the Eminonu docks, either by T1 tram or by taxi. Then find the IDO/Sehir Atlari office and ask for the Short Circle Bosphorus Cruise which departs at 14.30 daily. (They also do some longer cruises). You will be charged all of TL10 (4 Euros)!! The boat ride takes you up the Bosphorus as far as the second suspension bridge, and the only downside is the absence of a guide commentary but you get to see all the palaces and other sights. Its the ride the locals take so it cannot be bad!"

Before we even came closer, we already felt the beautiful view from our hotel. This magnificent view definitely tempted us to go on the cruise on the second day we were day. After having such a hectic day, ending the day on the cruise, enjoying the sunset is not only romantic but it's also give a feeling that is impossible to describe by words. So beautiful and so magnificent."

We stopped off for an hour at the top of the Horn to take a cable car up to Pierre Loti to see fantastic views of the city and have an ice cream or tea.Our guide Mali was excellent; friendly and knowledgeable. After coming down on the cable car he suggested a side trip to see the Ey\u00fcp Sultan mosque complex before walking back to the boat. Also, it was on a smaller boat that could go closer to shore and wasn't crowded like some of the large ones we saw. And they pick you up at your hotel and bring you back. All for 20 euros!"

One of the best things we did was catch a ferry to Anadolu Kavagi, a small village on the Bosphorus at the mouth of the Black Sea. It's a 90 min trip from Eminonu and costs TL25 return. The 1030 departure gets you there in time for lunch (dine on the water or walk up the hill to the old castle and check out the Black Sea before choosing a restaurant with a higher vantage point) and then get the 1500 back to Istanbul. It's a great day out!"

There is no guide, but it is cheap and leaves once an hour. Find the boat by the ferry cruise terminal. The ferry service runs a similar tour for 25 euro, but only in the afternoon. Private operators run guided tours for around 10 euro. The ferry service also runs a full tour (5 hours, roughly, including a lunch stop) that leaves around 10:30. The Yalis and palaces are nice to see from the water and it's a nice break from the crowds and traffic."

The Bosphorus tour can be the best part of your journey if you choose the right tour and fine weather accompany you.Important hints:- There are many fake yours, be aware!- Cost of tours are depend on their destinations and services. some of them will let you visit some places on both Asian and European side on foot and some of them just show you those places from the ship.- A short Bosphorus tour (at the moment) will cost you 10 TL.- A complete Bosphorus tour (at the moment) will cost you 25 TL at most! unless they serve you drinks or meal.- There are special tours which will let you to swim during the tour and also have some sun seats on their ships.- There are another kind of tours which will show you both Golden horn and Bosphorus with a single ride but normally they are very time limited and expensive.- You can take the tour in day or night but night tours are a little more expensive because usually they will serve you with drink and meal and a dance party.My Advise:I tried some of these tours and the best one was a short tour between Bosphorus bridge and Sultan Mehmet-II bridge which took a little more than 1 hour for 10 TL.You can find them in about 500 meters distance west of Bosphorus bridge.Don't forget to buy a \"Kumpir\" before getting on the ship. Then get on the ship go to the second floor in front, find some pillow, lie down, eat your Kumpir and enjoy the ride (You can buy additional drinks on the ship)."

We took a 1 hour shorter boat tour for 10 lira. There are longer tours for up to 26 Lira. Sited at the top deck, one can just relax and enjoy the busy strait. It was amazing to see the mosques, bridges and other structures from the water. It is more amazing to see the boats maneuvering around each other. A cheaper option to the tours is catching the public passenger ferry. It is cheaper but unlike the tour ferry, the public ferry makes lots of stops. Either way, on a nice clear day, this would be a highly recommended activity in Istanbul."

The views of both the European side of the Bosphorus and the Asian side were tremendous. It was a warm, sunny day, and the trip could not have been nicer. The ferry has a large snack bar and bathroom facilities at the mid part of the boat. Unfortunately, the bathroom was of the Turkish variety. The name of the ferry lines is Sehir Hatlari. In the summer there are two trips: one starts at 10:35 a.m. and the other at 1:35 p.m. The cost is 25 Turkish lira ($13.18 USD) per person. The trip each way takes about one and one-half hours. The lay over in Andolu Kavagi is two hours (not three hours as is listed on Sehir Hatlari web sight.) This is enough time to walk up the hill from town and look at the very interesting castle built by the Ottomans in the 15th century. You can also take a cab. The view of the Bosphorus on one side and the Black Sea on the other can not be beat.We rented the audio guide for 10 Turkish lira. It did not work very well going up the Bosphorus and not at all on the return trip. We asked for a refund, or at least an adjustment, but the ferry lines refused. I get the impression that all sales, and rentals, in Istanbul are final.The boat stops at three other towns before Andolu Kavagi, so make sure what town it is before you get off of the boat. My spouse and I did not so after the gang plank had been removed and the ferry was slowly departing, we jumped from the dock onto the ferry with the approval of the deck hands. This is Turkey after all."

Tip: on the return journey, get off at the Ortakoy stop to visit this neighbourhood which used to be a simple fishing village. It is touristy but still quite charming. You can't get back on the ferry to return to Istanbul port, so just take any bus that is going to Taksim square."

The other side it's just like any other modern town, full of very nice commercial and residential areas but we didn't feel that authentic and ancient charm that we liked so much across the bridge. But we love history and archaeological everything, so maybe if you enjoy shopping then you would probably like the Asian side of Istanbul much better because the whole town is filled with luxury brands shops."

The farther you transit into the straits you are struck by the places that \"are\" history, like Gallipoli. You are beginning to \"see\" history. As you enter Istanbul aboard ship, within the Bosporus, you can see and experience the vibrant ocean and inland water traffic that makes this city something different.Consider a additional boat tour further into Istanbul's Bosporus channel where the Bosporus narrows to it's closest point. Europe is on one side and Asia is on the other. Views of the beautiful homes, hotels and waterside restaurants facing the water will reward your choice to experience this short tour. Enjoy!"

So a boat tour of the Bosphorous is a terrific way to see the other parts of the city. While it won't give you the up-close experience you will get from guided land tours, you will see a large number of historically important and visually beautiful sites such as palaces, mosques, bridges, etc., all from a very pleasant boat ride. A good tour that covers much of the city waterfront will take several hours, and a knowledgeable guide will make it a worthwhile experience. You can then plan further excursions on land to cover the sites you want to review in more detail."

My wife and I took two Bosphorus cruises: the 90 minute cruise on Turyol (recommended by our hotel) and the full cruise on IDO departing at 10:35 and returning by 16:25. In both cases we were on boats without an open deck. Yes, there were seats (already taken by early birds) around the outside of the ship, and there was a very small aft deck, in the open air, which probably seated fewer than 25 people. In other words, if you wanted fresh air blowing in your face you were essentially out of luck stuck inside the ship. Or you had to stand somewhere not occupied by a fellow passenger. Yet we saw many boats sailing the Bosphorus with happy passengers on open upper decks, enjoying the fresh breezes. I recommend that you choose your boat carefully; go down to the Enim\u00f6n\u00fc peer by the Galata Bridge and see which boats have open decks that you can buy a ticket for and choose those boats, unless, that is, you like sitting behind glassed-in windows (they do open, making is somewhat less a tomb). Too, the IDO full cruise boat had one filthy bathroom for the entire boat, not exactly the accompaniment for a romantic cruise up one of the world\u2019s most famous waterways. One of the staff at the hotel hinted that it was the luck of the draw, so to speak, regarding what kind of boat you got from Turyol, but what we noticed was that beyond the main docking area in Enim\u00f6n\u00fc, where tour bus after tour bus parked, it seemed to us that these tours commandeered all of the open deck boats. I am not sure I am right about this, but that's what I saw. Maybe the tours book all the best boats in advance and leave the scows for the rest of us. Be warned. Choose your boat carefully. There were boats with open decks broadcasting tours from the peer. You\u2019ll have a much nicer, fresher, open air cruise if you just choose the right boat."

We spent about 3 hours in an Asian fishing village for lunch, but we climbed to the old tower first and were glad we did! It's a tough climb and many were exhausted after it. But the view of the Black Sea is worth it. Not much else up there except the view. Back in the village, we had lunch at one of the waterside restaurants. Nothing special. The ice cream from a sidewalk vendor was great, though."

There you can walk about have some coffee and travel back again. If you go on a night cruise take a jacket, it gets quite cold out on the water."

Their prices are way too high and the food isnt at all worth it. We ate grilled chicken file and grilled seabase fish and they tasted like water. Their prices were high and they charged so much for a bit of bread and water they served along with the food. They didnt even let us decide how much tip we wanted to give the waiter! They added it on our bill which pissed us off. If I were to go there again, I would definitely buy something from Istanbul and take it with me. A doner or some other sandwich.

            "review": "Could Be Fatal. Ironically, this turned out to be the most dangerous part of our trip to Turkey. We went on a Two Continents & Bosphorus tour, and a Bosphorus cruise was part of the itinerary. Our tour company was Tourista and the cruise boat they took us on was marked with their name. A few minutes into the cruise, we noticed a smokey smell on board, then some smoke rose from the lower deck. All the passengers started freaking out and evacuating to the outer parts of the boat. We could hear the crew argue in Turkish and they wouldn't let us know what was going on, other than that they will dock as soon as possible and continue the cruise on another boat. Throughout the whole ordeal, our guide kept on talking as if nothing was happening. One passenger started panicking for real after some time passed and we were still in the middle of the water. I looked out the boat and realized that, not only was it cold, but a whole bunch of jellyfish were circling the waters. Formulating an emergency escape plan in my head didn't provide me with any comfort under those circumstances. Death by frostbite, and a swollen jellyfish bit corpse was not the way I wanted to go. Still, I think I had it easier than the family with a baby and a toddler. My main worry actually was that the boat would explode and we'd be toast. All of a sudden, jumping ship didn't sound that bad. The lesson to learn here is to be very careful when choosing the operator of this cruise. The cruise itself was very nice, but our trip was tainted with this bad experience. We eventually docked and changed boats. The second one was safer and a lot nicer. I recommend that you go on a Bosphorus cruise while in Istanbul because you won't be able to see the coastal side of the sites along the shore unless you're on the Bosphorus."

It doesn't have a guide, but I don't really think you need one. (You will probably forget the names anyway). But, the visual beauty, you will remember for a long while. You will see the Galatta bridge overhead (which connects Taksim and Sultanahmet), You will pass several beautiful mosques, villas of the wealthy along the coast, Universities, palaces and the military school. We took the cruise closer to sunset and the water shimmering in the sunlight was a beautiful sight. If you look close enough, you will see millions of jelly fish just a few feet under water, which is clear enough for you to see through. The current is quite strong and you may feel your vessel rock a bit. However, if the boat is big enough, you aren't likely to feel sea-sick. For pictures, definitely, the upper deck is better. You can go out to the balcony on the lower deck, but you will be hiding the view from the other passengers inside. Carry/wear a jacket as the wind is chilly."

Our guide told us several well-known pop and movie stars live along the Strait - but as they're Turkish, you probably won't know them. On the return leg, you sail pass the Military School. Our guide appeared to take pride in informing us that Saddam Hussein and Col. Gadaffi were both graduates. We found that paying the cruise charge in Turkish Lira was cheaper - 70 lira for two, Money really well-spent.One word of warning - the breezes on the water can be strong and cold, even on what was a warm and sunny day onshore. If you want to take photos, you'll need to be on the open upper deck. So, take a jacket or prepare to get cold. Also, if you book your cruise from one of the company staff who frequent the main square beside the Blue Mosque, be prepared for a bit of a trek down the hill to the waterside.

Missing the Bosphorus when in Turkey is like missing the Chicago lakefront, or the New York City skyline, or the Golden Gate in San Francisco, or the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan.A boat tour, tourists and all, is worth it here. Many people come to the area and only visit one side. That might do for your first visit, but do yourself a favor and visit both sides.Also, do like the locals, and guess (sometimes out loud) about what the boats that seem to traverse in the evening are actually carrying."

We went to the Eminonu first. Then, we walked to the Spice Bazaar and bought some fresh Turkish Delight. After that, we returned to the embarkment, got our tickets for 10 TL(sometimes they are 12TL, depending on the ship-both are good) and got up the ship. It went right on 16:00(they go every hour sharp) We got into the warm salon, because it was February. The weather was sunny, but cool. We drank some hot Turkish tea for 1TL a glass with the sweets from the Bazaar and looked at the window. We saw some old palaces, we passed by, some Mosques, some big ships and little fisherman boats... When we got close to the Bosphorus Bridge, we became impacient to make photos. We went out to the open deck and made some, then we stood there for about half an hour, watching nice views with Rumelli Fortress, with some beautiful villas and chic boats, with palaces and bridges around. Then, we returned to the salon, took some more of hot tea and watched the sea and seagulls, flying around. We passed the famous Maden's Tower, deviding the Europe and Asia. By the time we approached Istanbul from the sea near Topkapi Palace, Sirkeci, Eminonu and Galata, we saw one of the most breathtaking sunsets in our lives!!! We went out with our cameras to the open deck again and made a pile of shots! It was about 10minutes of real passion! The sea was all around and we were going at the high spead towards Eminonu and Galata Bridge! We were really happy that very moment! That's why I love this Bosphorus tour! Usually it takes about 2 hours, but it's always worth of it. You can get close to many attractions like palaces or Mosques from the sea side and it is simply outstanding! You can not compare it to any other tour in Istanbul, I believe. It's just UNIQUE! That's why I advise it to everybody as the MUST! Enjoy it!"

A Bosphorus tour, especially the official city one, is a really great way to get a picture of the city of Istanbul from a unique perspective. On a good day, you can really enjoy going past the famous sites of the city: European style palaces, the great Bosphorus bridges, castles, Ottoman houses, and more, for a very reasonable price. Really though, avoid the expensive private tours and just take the public boats: either the full Bosphorus tour, or even the public ferries that hop from port to port (the schedules can be found online, it takes a little planning). Yoros castle at the end gives you a view of the Black Sea and there are lots of fish restaurants there. Along the way you'll see people fishing, boats passing by, and neighborhoods buzzing with activity on both sides. Close to shore, be sure to look out for huge groups of the famous jellyfish.My personal favorite stop along the Bosphorus is Kanlica on the Asian side. Absolutely the best Yogurt in Istanbul - served with the kaymak (clotted cream) still on top and eaten with powdered sugar. There is nothing like it, really - nothing!Also, if the season is right (mostly spring and fall I believe) you can see schools of dolphins swimming up and down the strait. Keep your eyes peeled, sometimes it's only three or four but sometimes it's dozens!"

Don't worry, there are several options when it comes to getting yourself floating on the Bosphorus, without swimming in it. Firstly, there is the long cruise that usually leaves the European side (usually close to Galata Bridge) and goes up to the Anadolu Kavagi on the Asian side. This takes most or all of one day and have heard mixed reviews about it. I wasn't bothered about the Asian side, as I've been to Asia and I didn't fancy a whole day trip. I just wanted to get on the river for a couple of hours and see the city. So, firstly I looked at one or two cruises that seemed to go up and down the river and all were more or less the same thing. However, I noticed that only one went into the golden horn and under the galata bridge. Sounds silly, but I really wanted to do that, as I felt the golden horn had some nice stuff to see and I'd miss some of it if I just took the usual trips up the Bosphorus. I found the cruise quite by accident when walking back to the Hagia Sophia from Topkapi Palace. Sales people advertise cruises in the street and you can find some good ones. This was the only one that went under galata bridge and I booked it for about 15 euros. 2hrs long and some really good memories of the city. VERY glad I did it! Just one thing to remember: The boats can look quite old and be in fairly tatty condition. I was a little apprehensive, but none of them looked great, so it wasn't just mine. Again, use your common sense and maybe check out a few before buying tickets. You can go down to the port close to galata bridge and see before buying. You will find lots of people at that port trying to sell you their cruise, so just compare routes and prices and see what one you're comfortable with. Whatever you do, DON'T leave Istanbul without doing even a short cruise, as it's really worth the effort."

It connects the European and Asian sides of Istanbul, both sides of which are littered with beautiful architectures everywhere. It's best take a cruise to fully enjoy what the strait has to offer. Heard the cruise is better at night, which I didn't experience myself but I can say for sure that the daytime cruise is worth every single lira."

The views along the river of both sides are spectacular. It also gives you some ideas of where else to explore outside the city centre. However, the final destination (A. Kavagi) is probably not quite interesting at all, apart from climbing up the hill to see the skeleton of the castle. Some other stops like Sariyer seems more interesting, but I didn't get a chance to pop down. I reckon it's well worth the experience whilst in Istanbul."

We had a great time on the boat, and would do it again, but don't expect to be amazed by this trip. Instead, get a nice seat (unless the boat is visiting the Asian side first, make sure you sit on the left side of the boat, otherwise you will only be looking at water or straining to look over someone else's shoulder the entire trip), buy some Turkish Tea and enjoy the ride.If you have young children with you, they may get bored...although probably not as much as with some of the other attractions you would have already drug them to.Disclaimer: we took the TurYol ferry, a 90-minute round trip tour.

Yoros Castle is a 20 min walk uphill from the town.

The private boats go from the left side of Galata Bridge on the Eminonu side. Walk along and see which boat looks the most seaworthy. The state ferry gos from the right hand side of the bridge. This cost 10 Turkish Lira and was great. The boat is large, and has n open top deck, but the lower deck is quite comfortable when its cold outside. It has toilets which get a bit grim towards the end of the trip."

However, if you find a better way to do the long itinerary than the official Bosphorus tour - do it! It's nothing for the price you pay - they sell as much tickets as they can, no consideration whatsoever that people will be smashed and not fit afterwards (consequently, this affects the experience). They bring you to the last stop and leave you there for more or less 3h which is a time lost if you don't have enough time in Istanbul. The remains of the Byzantine castle are very nice but nobody takes care of them, it is horribly dirty around and the only thing locals are interested in is how many restaurants to open in the vicinity so that they can attract the wandering tourists and get their money. More expensive than some places in Istanbul and literally nothing else to do but a short visit to the castle. So, def do the trip down the Bosphorus on a nice and warm day but if you can find alternative and more flexible ways to do it, don't hesitate :)"

It wasn't very busy on our boat but I suspect they can get crammed in the summer. They sell tea and orange juice on the boat and the staff come by frequently. There is no commentator or guide so bring your guide book or just relax and enjoy the views. We were lucky to have a pod of dolphins swim by us. There are also many jelly fish in the water. We also recommend to have a fish sandwich when you finish the cruise. For 5 lira you have a great lunch of fresh fish in bread with lettuce and onions. Delicious!"

We took the short Bosphorus tour on the Turyol ferry for 12 Lira for 1.5 hours. The ferry starts from the Eminonu pier near the Galata bridge. Always go at least half an hour before the ferry starts so you can get a good seat. The best seats are on the top deck near the back of the ferry where the view is not obstructed and one can get great pictures of both sides of the Bosphorus. There are beautiful palaces,hotels and private homes on both sides touching the water. One important note is to always carry a warm jacket as it gets very windy and chilly on the boat as there are strong winds over the Bosphorus. We went in March end and it was a sunny day but got very chilly by the time we reached the second bridge. They serve warm tea and biscuits on the boat for a charge (1 TL for tea). I would do this experience every-time I visit Istanbul as you get to see great views of the famous skyline of Istanbul that has captivated many great writers and painters throughout history."

First of all, in English it's simply \"The Bosphorus.\"The Bosphorus is the main feature that makes Istanbul what it is; without it, not only would Istanbul have much less scenic beauty, it would also have little reason for its existence. I think the best way to see the Bosphorus is to take the city lies cruise that leaves from the Bosphorus Quay (BO\u011eAZ \u0130ZKELES\u0130) in Emin\u00f6n\u00fc and goes up to Anadolu Kava\u011f\u0131, where you'll have time to walk up to the Yoros castle and enjoy the green and view of the Black Sea. Down in the village, there are lots of fish restaurants covering a wide range of prices and atmospheres. Also try the lokma, deep fried \"donuts\" drizzled with syrup, available at the stands near the waterfront. If you don't have all day, you can take the shorter (1 1/2 hour) tours on smaller boats that leave from nearby the Bosphorus Quay. The tour only goes as far as the second (Fatih Sultan Mehmet) bridge, but you'll see the most important areas including Rumeli Hisar\u0131 and Anadolu Hisar\u0131, the castles built by the Ottomans at the narrowest point.But if you have time, you should also take a bus or taxi if you're feeling flush, up to some of the charming villages on the shores. On the European side, Arnavutk\u00f6y, Bebek and Emirgan are nice; you can also visit Rumeli Hisar\u0131. On the Asian side, Kuzguncuk, Beylerbeyi, \u00c7engelk\u00f6y and Kanlica are beautiful, with lots of old Ottoman homes. Anadolu Hisar\u0131 is also pleasant but rather small with few dining options, and the castle there is not open to the public though you can look in through the gate. I hear there are plans to open it eventually.If you have time and the means, one of the nicest places is Anadolu Fener, at the very end of the Bosphorus on the Asian side. It's a quiet, even sleepy little village overlooking the Black Sea, and there are several relaxed, informal fish restaurants there. But it's quite a haul up there and the value is more in the rural nature of the place rather than historic sights."

Audio guide fit 5TL at the port was definitely worth it (they need 100TL deposit ) and easy to share one between two. Anadolu Kavagy at the end was OK. Bit of a walk up to the castle (ruined and you can't get in) and on a day when it was 11 degrees C took 25 minutes and made us pretty warm. Wouldn't like to do it on hot day - but would probably got a taxi up! View is worth it for 15 minutes then back down to the port to wrestle with restaurant touts. You are their only trade so expect it. We had a fine meal in one of the sea front places but were very clear on what we were being charged for fish. Prices are mostly per kilo so if something is 75TL on the menu the fish you point at may turn out to cost 110TL.

This is absolutely what someone must do when in Istanbul!You can use the Istanbulcard, it is really inexpensive to get one of the frequent ferries to the Asian side.Arrange to be en route during the sunset when returning from the Asian side.Th traffic is dense with large cargo vessels passing fron and forth of your ferry.Get a tea (chai) if in winter and you are in the external board."

Taking the boat, you will marvel at Istanbul landmarks, many of which can only be enjoyed from close this way. The Bosphorus Bridge, the Maiden's Tower, the Rumeli Fortress, the Dolmabahce Palace and other sights will pass before your eyes giving you an insight of different historical periods. Beautiful buildings of various styles will catch your eye. The - what seems to be - infinite blue and the company of seagulls all the way will make you wish this journey has no end.There are many options available:- A cruise that goes up the Strait. Cost: around 12 TL. From Emin\u00f6n\u00fc and Besiktas ports.- A ferry to the Prince Islands crossing the Sea of Marmara as well. From Kabatas port.- A ferry bus to the Asian side (Haydarpasa, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, Kadik\u00f6y). Cost: 1.90 TL (you can also  use your Istanbulkart). From Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, Karak\u00f6y, Besiktas and Kabatas ports. This is the cheapest way to cross the Bosphorus and visit the Asian side areas. I did it  everyday! Couldn't get enough!Make sure you cross it at least once at dusk or later. The sights are illuminated and it's simply magical!"

Both ferry terminals are well-lit and the area immediately around them feels safe enough.Note that the ferry uses a different type of token than the subway, and you can also not use the same type of pass as on the bus. The ferry tokens can easily be mistaken for coins."

I think it leaves at 10:30 am. In the summer, there are more departures. We also went to Kadikoy from the Karikoy ferry launch on the other side of the Galata bridge (you can also pick up the Kadikoy ferry from Eminonu) - it takes 25/30 minutes...also fantastic. The Bosphorus coast is amazing and seeing all the activity on the water and in the air (so many sea gulls!) is incredible.

If you only have 2 days in town, I wouldn't make this a priority, but if you've hit your other major spots in Istanbul, definitely take a tour on the Bosphorous for a relaxing day. Stop-off in Istanbul's New District to get a feel for the lively, modern side of Istanbul. But make sure you leave in time to catch a ferry back to the Old District (if that's where you're staying).

However, a trip to Istanbul any time of the year would be incomplete without visiting the Bosphorus. I was recently in Istanbul with a friend and took a long walk along the Bosphorus (about 3 kilometers) on a Sunday afternoon. It was freezing (it actually snowed about a meter while I was there), windy, biting... but beautiful. It amazed me how few people were walking along the boardwalk, however I took full advantage of the peace and quiet after spending several days in the chaotic Sultanahmet district. If you decide to go for a stroll in this area in the off-season, keep your eyes open for fishermen camped out among the rocks. I encountered a few camps of elderly men playing board games and making tea over a small fire while fishing- it definitely felt more \"authentic\" than the hoards if tourists in the historic center. Next time I come to Istanbul, I will definitely make sure I visit the Bosphorus again- but this time, I will come in a warmer season! PS. If you are dead-set on going on a boat tour of the Bosphorus, make sure you compare prices and look for reviews of the experience. I tried one company with my friend and was highly disappointed (and ripped off with the Euro/ Lira conversion)!"

The sky was a blinding blue, with wisps of white clouds floating lazily about it, and the sea was blue one minute and green the next. The sights on both sides of the strait were fabulous: beautifully-preserved greyish-blue palaces stood next to bright white houses with terracotta roofs, a stodgy little fort looked out on the waters from its perch on a hillock and boats of all sizes and shapes and colours sailed by, carrying tired but happy-looking children and men and women. Crowds of men lined the shore on the European side, angling for fish, shouting and joking and having a very pleasant time, clearly. The bridges straddling the strait have an elegant simplicity that is striking and the foam falling away from our boat as we returned to the harbour was the purest shade of white you can hope to see. One must round off this trip with a climb up to the Cafe Pierre Lotti. The views of the golden triangle from up there are gorgeous. If it is already dark by the time you are ready to head back to your hotel, take the cable car down, by all means. Even though it is a brief ride, the exhilaration you experience as you descend from the dark hill-top into the city's million lights is priceless! When in Istanbul, do not dream of giving the Bosphorous cruise a miss!"

Must travel by the cruise, to see the beautiful Bosphorus bridge which is lit up at night, and the beautiful landmarks like Dolmabahce Palace."

In retrospect I would probably have done a 2 hour tour instead of a full day tour, the only difference being that you would miss the old Roman fortress during the 3 hour lunch break. It is a bit of a climb but a great view from the top, however prices of meals are obviously marked up (think 20-30 liras per person). A nice way to see Istanbul and made me realize how huge the city actually is."

We were able to see both ends of the Bosphorus, where it meets the Black Sea, and where it meets the Dardenelles. Between the old city on the European side, and the newer city on Asia Minor, the Golden Horn separates these. Small boats and large tankers cruise back and forth, and bridges are gracefully suspended above, shuttling thousands of vehicles across all day long.

We simply love the view of the Bosphorus, its surroundings, the bridge, the castle, the houses overlooking Bosphorus and did not feel that our journey actually takes 3 hours (the longer version) to Anadolu Kavagi. The ferry only cost us 25 Lira and for the shorter trip (2 hours) they will only charge 10 Lira. Since I took the morning cruise, this will be my lunch spot, there are many restaurants but I have picked Baba restaurant that has the lovely sea view and many seagulls! The mezze were plenty, I love the stuffed mussels! For main dish, I would recommend the grilled fish. We went uphill to the ruined castle (a good exercise!) and took many photos of the scenic view from top of the hill where there is also a restaurant for you to rest and relax. We went back to our ferry before 3pm to return to the city. On the return journey, we sat on the left side to see the other part of Bosphorus and lovely scenery. Recommended to all visitors to just unwind, relax and appreciate God's gift and creation. Lots of postcard photos can be taken from the ferry journey!"

My wife and I had a day to fill in while in Istanbul and based on the recommendation of the staff at our hotel, we had them booked a day long tour of the Bosphorus Strait and Golden Horn, followed by a land based afternoon bus tour of selected sights in Istanbul. The highlight was the boat trip which gave absolutely magnificent views of the various mosques, palaces and other atractions that can only really be appreciated by being seen from this historic waterway. It really shouldn't make a difference which firm you book with - any one of the main stream providers will cover the same spectacular sights. The afternoon was a bus tour which again took in some of the main atractions, this time from strategic viewing points such as hills overlooking Istanbul. This offered a diffrent perspective on what you had seen from the water and well worth it. The only down-side is the mandatory afternoon stop-off for a fashion display at a local leather goods outlets where the very obvious intent is that you will buy something. There was no real pressure, so that was a surprise, and the day concluded with a very strong feeling that we had made an excellent choice in how to spend our day. Highly recommended."

It is a very busy waterway; vessels of all kinds ply this route - from sea-going tankers, cruise ships,barges, ferries, sea buses to fishing boats of all sizes. A wonderful way to explore the strait is by a tour boat or a ferry boat. Turyol operates brief narrated tours out of the wharf at Eminonu. If you're on the Eminonu side, facing the Galata bridge, the ticket station for the Bosphorus boat tour- Turyol is on your left. Another way is to take a longer boat ride on the ferry terminating at Anadolu Kavagli. You will need almost an entire day for the roundtrip which costs 25 Turkish lira, roughly $15.00 per person. It is best to get on the boat in the morning for a leisurely pace and allow ample time to get out and eat lunch at one of the fish restaurants in the village. The boat leaves for Anadolu at 8:30, 9:00, 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. - but be sure to double check the schedule for any changes. This is a very relaxing trip providing a vista of some famous landmarks such as the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya and the Hayderpasha Train Station (for eastbound international trains). There are lots of wonderful photo opportunities - as the boat leaves the Eminonu, seagulls by the thousands frolick overhead as if sending off the ferry with a joyous farewell. Seagulls follow the ferry as it makes its way along the strait, feeding on fish that have surfaced from the roar of the boat's engine below.. Here you get a panoramic view of Istanbul's historical old district from the Eminonu side, the Galata tower and the old buildings around it stacked like cubes upon a hill on Karakoy, and the two-level Galata bridge with hundreds of fishing lines spilling over. Along the coast you will see quaint villages, the shores dotted with restored old Ottoman wooden houses, once homes to the privileged & many of which have now been converted into guest houses and restaurants, some remain as private residences. The Bosphorus Bridge, resembling the Golden Gate Bridge, flashes its splendor at night. It is best seen from the seaside in Ortakoy. The bridge is equipped with a lighting system which flashes varying hues from yellow, green, blue, etc. throughout the night. It's a magnificent for nighttime photography. In Ortakoy, you can stroll around in the pedestrian zone, sit with a glass of tea or Turkish coffee in one of the seaside restaurants, or simply order one from the vendors around. Vendors selling all kinds of crafts, especially a wide variety of handcrafted items and costume jewelry abound."

In a nutshell, here is my rundown:1. Wake-up early. Take the tram (3TL) and be there at Eminonu station around 9AM. Walk in the underpass going to the cruise area. You'll see shops that actually sells cheaper than the rest of the tourist areas around Istanbul.2. If you arrive early, buy the 2-way tickets (25 TL) and the Audioguide (5TL) before the line starts around 10AM. 3. Feel free to check and roam around. Visit the near by New Mosque across the street. Buy Water. Check the shops.4. Take the tram around 10:30AM. Earlier if you want a good spot at the open air desk on the top floor. Bring a book and a camera.5. Expect to be hungry since you'll arrive at the 6th stop past 12nn. Bring snack. 6. Once you are at Kavagi stop, check the schedule when the ferry will leave. 7. People will haggle for you to eat at their restaurants. Choose carefully and take your time. You can buy a fish sandwich nearby, and continue walking going to the top of the hill. There are overlooking restaurants on your way up, better places to eat.Suggestions for seafood dishes since Anadolu KavagI is technically a fishermen's village:- Grilled Fish - Lufer (blue fish) and Palamut (bonito), but get them where you think they are likely to know how to do them, and eat them grilled. The blue fish from the bosphorus is fresh and nice. Do not eat any other fish unless you can find john dory/st. pierre. They will bring a basket of fresh fish, you can ask them the prices directly to avoid surprises.- Hamsi - Black Sea anchovy, small fish crispy fried.This itinerary is ideal if you want to rest in between spending a day standing and walking around Sultanahmet area.Hope it helps you on planning your trip."

That takes you to a place called Anadolu Kavagiou in 1,5 hours. Here you stop for three hours and walk up to the castle. Why? Well it's not too tough and from there you can see the Black Sea. Several restaurants for simple food such as k\u00f6fte on the way down. There are needless to say lots of interesting buildings, bays etc to see along the way. Tea/coffe served onboard."

We picked a nice medium size ship, paid the 10 Lira ticket charge and off we went. Wonderful to see all the beautiful historic areas from the water. The sea was calm, it was a delight. For three hours we were pampered with historic views.On the boat it was calm, but one could feel the activity on land. The tour went all the way back to the second bridge before it turned around back to the terminal. It lasted three hours and it was sensational."

To use the various ferries it is important to distinguish between the big boys - IDO and Sehir Hatlari - and the various (expensive) tourist oriented offerings.The descriptions of the ferries are sometimes confusing - IMHO a fast ferry is a catamaran,like takes you from Kabatas to Bostanci in 35 minutes! (IDO), but this description is used for far slower boats / car ferries.The websites of the first two mentioned are a mine of information - also if you are are interested in travelling under your own steam to the Princes Islands - Mavi Marmara (based in Bostanci) might be useful.Doing it like the Istanbulis is a lot cheaper than using the tourist boats from Kabatas.Points to note are that there are summer and winter timetables and that the fast ferries are used to bring commuters into the centre in the morning and away in the late afternoon.Akbils and Istanbul cards work on most of the ferries. (Akbils were still going strong in October 2012). Of course Akbils and Istanbul cards can also be used on the Metro / Modern trams / buses and work out far cheaper than jetons. (See the IETT website). Mavi Marmara has a website only in Turkish - Google translator works well on it.For the Princes islands there are Sehir Hatlari and IDO services (but sometimes at\"odd\" times for tourists) and the possibility of travelling indirectly via Bostanci.Bostanci is served by IDO and by TCDD (suburban railway from Hyderpasa) and by the M4 Metro from Kadikoy.The TCDD station is close to the ferry terminal - not sure about the Metro.The afternoon slow ferry back to Istanbul (Kabatas) by Sehir Hatlari from B\u00fcy\u00fckuda (biggest Princes island) is great on a fine day! B\u00fcy\u00fckuda is well worth visiting - no cars! You can hire a bike (even an electric one) or take a \"Fayton\" four seater coach. It's mostly a residential area for the well-off and is also a beloved day-excursion for the Istanbulis - not much in the way of foreign languages used by waiters  so bring your Turkish phrasebook! The TCDD (suburban railway from Hyderpasa) will take you as far as Pendik - there you can take a ferry to Yalova on the southern Marmara shore, and a ferry (slow) back to Yenikapi (Istanbul).(Line shut at Pendik in October 2012 - work continuing on the stretch to ? Gebce).Yenikapi seems to be the main IDO terminal and can be easiy reached by surburban train from Sirkeci / Imin\u00f6n\u00fc - from here you can take fast ferries to some pretty distant destinations, but as they are oriented to the commuter traffic they are not aleays convenient for day trips(OK if you want to overnight away 'tho).When the \"Marmaray\" project is completed and there is a rail line under the Bosphorus - this will all change..A good reason to visit Istanbul again before it is!"

We also took advantage of the commentary for YTL5 along with YTL25, its great value for money. The tourist cruises are shorter and cover less of the Bosphorus for more dollars/lira. If you can spare a day, then the local ferry with some tourist features is highly recommended. We enjoyed it so much that another day we took part of the trip to enjoy lunch at Kanlica and more of its wonderful yoghurt with jam. Icing sugar is essential as it can have a sharp taste without it."

I tried to plan ahead, but wound up just hopping on one of the tours people were peddling along the way. You can find one for 20TL and they'll serve drinks on board.

It cost us 25TL pp. There were about 5 stops between Istanbul and Anadolu Kava\u011f\u0131. If the weather is nice, sit outside so that you get to see several of the old palaces. There's plenty of seating and they also offer tea/coffee service, as well as a small kiosk for snacks. DO NOT USE THE BATHROOMS! They're just small holes in the ground, smell like urine and are incredibly filthy. Once you arrive at Anadolu Kava\u011f\u0131, you get about 2-3 hours to explore the town. As usual, there are restaurants as soon as you arrive and they're all trying to get you to spend some money. We walked up to the old roman castle at the top of the town. It was a pretty good hike up a very steep hill, so I would suggest wearing tennis shoes. You'll also walk through a small area with restaurants and souvenir shops. There's a small bathroom in the area, and I would highly suggest using this one instead of the one on the ferry."

I went to Istanbul in May this year, which is a good time to go since the weather is mild, and spent a lovely morning on the Bosphorus.The highly informative, kind and humourous freelance tour guide, Tayfun Diker of Turista Travel Agency in Sultanahmet led a small group of us(7), including himself and another young lady guide on a private ferry trip to Princes Islands, about 20kms south of Istanbul.It was a bit difficult to find a window seat on the ferry but once we got to the largest Island, the scenery was charming, there was a surprise - no cars! We spent a tranquil morning on a chariot(horse drawn) topless carriage ride, eating home-made ice cream in the town square, mingling with the cats and dogs(even if they are strays, they are cared for by the municipality). The latter do tend to hare round in their cars - but this is about one every hour- they are the only ones allowed to drive a car on the island. The rest of the population walk, cycle or visitors ride on the open horse-drawn carriages. The day was warm and the views of the sea were pretty, with pine forests in which the horses ran wild when they were let free. It was a leisurely relaxed time, reminiscent of some places like Fresnaye in my home city, Cape Town. The fish lunch at a restaurant was ok, but then I'm not into fish. I enjoyed the sea breeze."

Great value. Listen for the chant of \"Bosporos ...

Although the crew did not speak much English they were very attentive to us and served white wine during the 2 hour cruise up the European side and returning via the Asian side. The price included an air conditioned van and driver to our restaurant the same evening."

            "review": "Most enjoyable (and cheapest) tour in town!. The reason Istanbul (called Byzantium when founded by the Greeks from Megara in 657BC, then called Constantinople after Roman emperor Constantine the Great made it his capital in 330AD, then called Istanbul after the Turks conquered it in the 1453AD) was built in its location was because it commands and controls the Bosphorus Strait. It can thus permit or prevent maritime travel between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. All around the city are forts and pleasure palaces, and all manner of interesting sights that reflect the city\u2019s consequent power and history, and its level of command and control over the Bosphorus Strait. Today, you can see this for yourself easily and in comfort, for just a few Turkish Lira, by taking a trip on a classic Istanbul ferry.The ferries of Istanbul are run by four companies. The big traditional multi-deck ferries with wide viewing decks at the stern and stand-up bars serving food and drinks are run by Sehir Hatlari Traditional Ferries. These are the ferries beloved of tourists and Turks alike. They run from Eminonu and Sirkeci on the old Istanbul side of the Galata Bridge and from Karakoy and Kabatas across the Galata Bridge on the modern European side; and they travel to destinations across the Bosphorus on the Asian side, and up and down the Bosphorus Strait on both sides for several kilometers. Two smaller companies, TurYol and Dentur Avrasya, also operate smaller ferries along these routes and out to the Princes Islands. All three operate Bosphorus Cruises which they run twice a day and which last about 2 hours. I personally think the big old traditional ferries are the only ones to travel on, when doing a Bosphorus Cruise, because they have a walk-up bar, lots of toilets, and plenty of viewing space. So make sure you check what vessel you\u2019ll travel on before you book your Bosphorus Cruise.A fourth cruise line is IDO (which stands for Istanbul Deniz Otobusleri). This operates fast \u2018SeaBus\u2019 catamaran services and car ferries both within the Istanbul area, and to ports as far away as Canakkale near Gallipoli at the Mediterranean end of the Bosphorus.Bottom line: Taking a ferry ride when you\u2019re in Istanbul is a \u201cmust do\u201d. But do your research first, on routes and times, and ask your hotel how to get to your nearest ferry wharf, and what to look for when you get there. Smart travelers can work it out for themselves, but it never hurts to seek a little local help.TIP: There are lots of ferries in Istanbul \u2026 and some are run by cowboys. The cowboys tend to use any trick they can to get you aboard their boats \u2026 which tend to be more expensive and spend less time motoring on cruises. If you\u2019re just going across the Bosphorus on a short run, maybe it doesn\u2019t matter. But if you want to go on a two-hour cruise, it\u2019s always best to seek out the official ferries. Please be careful you\u2019re not side-tracked. I was planning to take a 2-hour Bosphorus Cruise and I knew the best and cheapest Bosphorus Cruises were run using those old traditional Istanbul ferryboats. Tickets to these cruises are only available at the Government ferry ticket office at Eminonu wharf. So I headed there. Nearby, an older Turk in a white Admiral\u2019s uniform stopped me, claiming to represent an \u2018official\u2019 Bosphorus Cruise. He directed me to a mini-van standing on the curb with open door, which \u2018he said\u2019 would take me to the ferry wharf on the other side of the Galata Bridge. Since I could see the government ferry ticket office just 30 meters away near the bridge, and a big old traditional ferry beside it, I knew he was actually trying to lure me off track to one of the cowboy\u2019s tour boats. So I brushed him off, and kept walking. But he got some others to enter that mini-van. As a result, I had a leisurely tour of the Bosphorus Strait in the wide back deck of an old traditional Istanbul ferry (see my photos) while they had a faster, more expensive tour in a more modern vessel. I\u2019ll let you decide which tour of the Bosphorus Strait you\u2019d prefer."

There are a lot of tourist tours that you can go on if you want to sail the Bosphorus, but we chose to take the tram to Kabatas (very easy) and then take one of the roundtrips from there.

            "review": "Beautiful cruise, excellent value, perfect Day 3 or Day 4 activity. My 10:30am cruise to Asia was not fully booked. I lined up at about 10am and got a great seat on the top deck, left side, right next to the water. Try to sit on the left side of the boat in both parts of the round trip: better for lighting. Also, a seat towards the back of the boat is preferable: exhaust fumes are weaker when the boat is docked and idling. Use a good guidebook or rent the audioguide for the tour; otherwise it's impossible to identify some of these buildings. Boat travels at a very modest speed, lots of time to take photos of each sight. Staff come by selling coffee, tea, water and on the cruise back, ice cream.My boat docked at the last Asian fishing village at 12:10pm, and the first boat back started boarding at 2:30pm to leave at 3pm. That's plenty of time to hike to Yoros Castle. That hike is short (20 minutes), but fairly steep at some points; footing is not always great; few handholds and little shade. This is a military training zone, and you aren't allowed to take any photos during the hike, only at the top. You know you're near the top when you see the cafes. You can walk through them without buying anything - they are built on public property. W/Cs here if you need them for 1TL.The view of the Sea of Marmama and Black Sea is worth the trouble. When you get to the top, you get to a small landing with lots of litter and no place to sit (except the ground). You might see a steel door to the castle that's chained shut. Knock or holler for the attendant to open it. It leads to another landing with a much better view. Note the castle interior is not for viewing.This would be an ideal place to have a picnic or just chill out if it were kept cleaner. Also a few picnic tables or benches would help. There are also a few friendly stray dogs looking for your food scraps. So I just took pictures, had some water, and left.The walk downhill is much easier, and then you can have lunch either on top of the hill or by the marina. At the marina, you have basically 3 classes of restaurant: 1) the diner-style where for 15TL you can get a combo meal 2) upscale prix-fixe for 25TL 3) the fancier sit-down style to go a la carte for 40TL (huge portions, whole grilled fish - worth it). The higher price usually gets you a table by the water. The cheaper ones are all more inland. I suspect the food is similar at all of them. None of the restaurants has a free W/C - no matter what, you will be paying 1TL. (So use the one on the boat before docking.)In the town, there is a small grocery store where you can get cheap water (1TL for a 1.5L bottle). There is also a bakery whose specialty is anchovy cornbread (tasty but very dry - needs some melted butter, or at least a big beverage). Some stands sell loksa (donuts in syrup), but the vendor told me they only sell them on weekends. Lots of ice cream, though. Also Anatolian souvenir shops.I lined up for the return cruise at 2:40pm and got a good seat on the top deck. It's a little more crowded because another boat would have docked at 1:30pm or so, and those passengers can opt for this return cruise. On the cruise back (same route exactly), I sat on the left side and got a better view of the Asian sights (they are fewer, less exciting). Closer to the city, I got some great shots of Topkapi and Ayasofya - you are actually closer to the sights than you are shooting from Galata Tower. (i.e. I don't see any value in Galata Tower.) On the return, people are mored tired - some just nap. If you need to take photos of the Europe side, there is no problem. We docked at about 4:30pm and I was exhausted, no energy to see anything else that day.Overall, this is a very enjoyable day, but a big investment in time. The best photo opportunities in the city, for sure, but I wouldn't put this above seeing the Old City sights first. You absolutely need good weather to do this. And at 25TL round-trip, this is an incredible value. IMO, a perfect Day 3 or 4 activity."

We chose a sunny day during the week (less crowded) and a 10:35 a.m. departure because that would take us into Anadolu Karvagi just in time for lunch. The round trip was 25TL.We also made it a point to show up for boarding about 30 minutes before departure to ensure that we got a seat on the upper deck and on the left side of the boat (on the way up most attractions are on the left, the European side of the Strait, and you avoid having the sun in your eyes on the way back).The ship made several stops along the way but only long enough to drop-off and pick up passengers.During the first hour there was a photo frenzy with passengers wanting to photograph and be photographed because the views are simply amazing (the numerous palaces, two bridges connecting the two continents, park areas, luxurious homes, and smaller villages as we got up towards the Black Sea.The rest of the boat ride is much more relaxing. On board you had a snack bar and waiters came around constantly to sell food and drinks; the yogurt that they pick up in Kanlica is worth tasting. The washrooms were OK if you don't mind rudimentary boat WC's....We docked in Anadolu Karvagi at half past noon. This small fishing village on the Asian side is where the ferry makes its last stop and takes a break for lunch before heading back at 3:00 p.m. We decided to stay away from the restaurants that are along the shoreline and walked around the village, bought some souvenirs and then had lunch in a family-run eatery off the central area. This also meant not going up to visit Yoros Castle; again, because we wanted to board 30 minutes before departure.We arrived back in the Old Town around 5:00 p.m. a bit tired but well satisfied with our excursion.While in Istanbul if you have the time, I recommend this inexpensive cruise which provides the opportunity to relax, appreciate the massive size of this city and its outlying landmarks, and tour one of the busiest waterways located at the junction of two continents."

In addition to the departures he lists there, at 10.35 and 13.35, there is (in season) a noon departure, which I took, reckoning not to spend three hours and more at Anadolu Kavagi (the sailing back being at 15.00). The round trip, at 25TL, is well worth it. There's a bit of a rush for the seats on the open decks, and a certain amount of crowding for the photo frenzies that every bridge, large building and stray cat caused, but by and large it's a very relaxing experience, as even the most avidly erect of the telephoto lenses retract in satiety. The spurned inside saloons, by the way, are spacious and comfortable, and also offer good views. (Tip: use the bathroom before boarding: those on board are strictly for the truly desperate.) Snacks are on sale, but I didn't sample those, so can't report. I did buy a carton of the apparently word-famous yoghurt that comes on board at Kaslica on the Asian side, and it was indeed good. The ferry was a bit behind schedule, so we docked at Anadolu Kovagi at about 14.00, which was a pity, because the plethora of fish restaurants looked inviting, but I didn't want to rush a meal to catch the 15.00 sailing. There is in fact a 16.00 sailing, but I had to be back in Istanbul fairly early, so couldn't make that. So: either take the noon sailing, or plan to take the 16.00 return trip, and indulge in a fish meal at Anadolu. I can't stand in for the quality, but it looked very good in passing.The trip back is a more sedate affair, everyone now having photographed everything remotely worth photographing, providing for a relaxing end to a long but fascinating trip. Don't miss it."

These will not include free lunch, or hotel pickup, but for the difference in price you can more than buy lunch.The cruise I took was provided by TurYol. They leave from the base of the Galata Bridge (southwest end). Easily accessible using mass transportation : take the subway to Emin\u00f6n\u00fc(T1 line). When you get up to the street walk near the coast to the other side of the foot of the bridge (not across the bridge). You will be walking west-southwest.The tour lasted an hour and a half. Cost is 12TL (less than $7, a little over 5\u20ac).Plenty to see. I was quite satisfied with what I got for my money. See uploaded picture for the route.Another option is the service provided by Bogaz Turlari. I did not take their cruises, but picked up a brochure. They offer night cruises as well.Their \"Short Circle Tour\" is 2hrs. and costs 10TL. The Full Cruise is 25TL.Yet another alternative is taking the regular commuter ferries, as mentioned by others here.

A round trip takes about 1 hour unless you get off on the Asian continent. There was a man on my ferry feeding the seagulls travelling by with bread. This was quite entertaining, he was clearly enjoying himself, though I think his son was a little embarrassed! But that's what fathers are for!"

We took a cruise lasting about 2 hours, it cost 10TL per person. While waiting on board to depart, we could see the 3 old-style boats on which the chefs were skillfully and artfully preparing fish. One of the area's delicacies is a fish sandwich - just fish in a bun! The scenic vistas along the cruise cannot be described adequately - they must be experienced. Ranging from small to humongous estates, palaces and hillside chalets, there are some beautiful properties in sight. The mosques in view at sunset are a sight to behold. Somehow I was not expecting the Bosphorus to be as clean as it was. The water was not murky. I wish I had the time for a full 6-hour cruise as that would have meant seeing the Black Sea. However the 2-hour cruise allowed a good experience of the Bosphorus strait. The company I went with is called Turyol and they're located to the left of the Gallata bridge.

It also provided many of my favorite pictures and views from our trip. You can just sit in the sun and enjoy the afternoon while seeing many amazing sights, what's not to love? After being in the city for many days and being crammed on the Tram before departing it was also nice to be out in the open with the fresh air.I would rate this as a must do in Istanbul!"

Get some clean sea air, perhaps some rain and inevitably some spray to blow away the dust and madness of the big sights. Make your own way across the Golden Horn Bridge and probably get a cheaper price - but there's better things to do in Istanbul than worry about money. It's world-class value.

The boat does not stop so there is no opportunity to get off and explore but it goes way beyond the 2nd bridge so you do get to see a lot more of the Bosphorus than with many other more expensive cruises.A word of warning, the description \"public ferry\" is also used by the private ferry companies to lure you onto the wrong boat so make sure the boat you get is IDO, sometimes just called Deniz for short."

Also nearby, in ancient times, it is thought that Troy lay at the mouth of this waterway, but after centuries of flooding and deposits of silt, Troy is now many kilometres from its mouth. On one side of the Bosphorus lies Asia, and on the other Europe. There are many vantage points where travellers and citizens can sit and enjoy the shipping traffic up and down. Along its shores are castles and old Ottoman palaces, one worth visiting in particular on a waterway cruise/tour is the Summer Palace. If you take a water tour you will get an amazing perspective on life in Istanbul. Another thing you can do is to take a suburban ferry to the 'other side' and find a restaurant or ice cream parlour (the Turkish do great ice cream!) and see how the locals live, dine and party. Cruise boats and ferries depart from the docks in Eminonu. Istanbul from the water is a wonderful experience. Of course, don't forget your camera!"

The cruise gave us a different view of Istanbul, both the European and Asian side. We saw Dolmahbahce Palace and many beautiful houses along the straits. We also saw the impressive fortress... I think..Rumeli Hisari...It was a beautiful view...especially at sunsets. But the highlights of our cruise was watching the dolphins swimming beside our ferry...many of them...I had never seen dolphins this close before. It took us all by surprise...!!. Cruising the Bosporus is a must in Istanbul...and if you are lucky you get the chance to watch dolphins like us...:)"

Every little \"town\" is just a little gem of its own. Start from Ortakoy and just continue walking by the strait, under the Bosphorus Bridge, get to Bebek - stop by for a cup of coffee at Bebek Cafe. Continue your walk towards Emirgan, but stop by Rumeli first. Have lunch at one of the restaurants - they are awesome. Continue on to Emirgan, stop by the Emirgan Gardens and the \"Atli Kosk Museum\". Then keep going to Tarabya, sit right by the water for a nice mid afternoon tea.

This body of water is what has made Istanbul so important so of course you should go up it and see the many beautiful buildings erected along it's banks. The trip is a long and the boat is slow so don't expect thrills, but a relaxing few hours.You don't get to see too much up close so I'd recommend the audio tour guide which has pictures as well as the histories behind the impressive works of architecture. On the public boat vs tour boat issue, consider that the latter includes lunch and the public does not. Considering prices at the final stop of the public boats trip, the cost is basically equivalent so unless your picnicking you're not saving anything."

The only downside with these cruises is there is no one saying anything about what you are seeing, and after half an hour of no guidance, it gets somewhat boring. I tried purchasing an audio guide, but they wanted to hold on to my ID. As I had only brought my passport, I absolutely refused, just to be on the safe side.

Take a sweater because even in the summertime, it can get a little windy. At the last stop, there is a little town. We walked up the steep hill to visit Yoros Castle (wear practical shoes), and stopped at one of the many hillside restaurants along the way to have a simple lunch overlooking the water. The path to Yoros Castle isn't particularly well marked, and there isn't much to see once you get to the top, but the view is amazing and you can see where the Bosphorus meets the Black Sea.No need to pay boku bucks for a Bosphorus Cruise when the government does a fine job with its public ferry!"

The water is so blue contrasting with the green hills and white buildings and it's a great way to start any visit."

I would definately reccomend anyone in Istanbul to go on a boat trip. But make sure you get your ticketd for the Bosphorus right near to the boats. It was 15 TLR. Other people who are selling the tickets are selling them more expensive. I would give this 10/10 ;)"

One of the highlights of my 3 night break in Istanbul was the ferry trip cruise up the Bosporus Strait, which connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara which is connected to the Mediterranean Sea. The Bosporus Strait divides the city & marks the division between Europe & Asia.You can walk to the ferry docks at Eminonu Quay (a busy square near the Galata Bridge on the Sultanahmet side). Three bodies of water meet here: the Golden Horn, Bosporus Strait & Sea of Marmara. Among the crowd, iPods & designer sunglasses vie with headscarves & prayer beads as the accessory of choice - showcasing the diversity of the 13-million strong local population. Don't miss the chance to unwind & watch the world go by - it's a stopping point for boats & ferries & is a great place to sample a beautiful outdoor restaurant.Then you can join the commuter rush & take a boat which departs daily at 10:30. The ferries are comfortable with plentiful seating inside and out. After several days of walking all over the city it was great to be able to sit outside in the breeze and watch the scenery go by. It really gives you a sense of how big the city is. The ferry passes the waterfront late ottoman Era pleasure palaces of Dolmabahce & Beylerbeyi. All along the shoreline, you see Istanbullus in pursuit of keyif. In a stretch of parkland, four elderly men sat on garden chairs in an intimate circle, playing backgammon. On a nearby bench a man presented a veiled woman with a single red rose.The ferry stops at several points along the route. Then you can return to the old city by another ferry trip."

The fact that when you are in Istanbul and cross over one of the bridges with the Blue Bus, you have left Europe and have landed in Africa. Pretty cool. (The downtown of Istanbul is in Europe, and the majority of it is in Africa). The River is the heartbeat of the city, and many of its most splendid heritage sites sit on its banks. We went back and forth over the river, and enjoyed the vistas each time, particularly from a restaurant with a view.Our most magical Bosphorus experience happened on a previous trip to Istanbul, when for two and a half incredible days we stayed at the Ciragan Palace Hotel, a magnificent 6 star hotel on the banks of the Bosphorus. Well, we did go down to the Old town to see the usual -(Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar etc. etc.) but otherwise we just stayed enjoying the rare experience of a world class hotel, with its infinity swimming pool visually blending into the Bosphorus itself. Perfect weather.We had to pinch ourselves. And then to add to the magic, a political figure was getting married in the hotel that night, and the keeping up with the Joneses in Istanbul is to have fireworks at the wedding. So there we were, with the magic enhanced by fireworks over our heads, reflecting in the pool and river. Can it get better than that?That hotel is very close (I think next door) to the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace - a must see, with an incredible Harem and also fantastic grounds on the Bosphorus. Save your luxury money, and walk from the Palace and harem, to the Ciragan and see it for yourself at a memorable lunch."

We made the very hot and rustic climb up to the castle ruins for the beautiful view of the Black Sea and then had a wonderful sea bass lunch at one of the restaurants that are about 1/3 of the way back down.

Head to Eminonu, hit the ferry terminal by the river. Take one of the ferries to a destination of choice. If I remember correctly, it is just 10-15 lira. Get off anywhere along the route, then finally take a trip back. Sure, you might not have a tour guide telling you what you are looking at, but trust me, you are not missing out on much. Instead, you get to interact or absorb the local culture with the locals. No better way to travel the bosphorous, in my opinion. I reckon I would have enjoyed this alternative more."

After the initial hour of oohing and aahing at the seaside palaces, mosques, etc., we started to feel bored by the similar scenery. We were also told that the boat would stop at the Asian side for 2 hours but we werent told that the Asian side consists of a village with cafes and restaurants catering mainly to captive tourist groups off the ferry boats, like us. There is also an ancient castle up a steep hill, and a quaint village in the interior, away from the mess at the front, but that is all. On hindsight, we felt that the 2 hour tour was more than sufficient, and the boat does not make any stops like ours did along the Bosphorus."

Then I took the Bosphorus cruise (twice). You chug down the Straits, hitting little twons on both the Asian and European sides. At the last stop the ferry waits about 90 minutes, then hits all the towns on the way back. With a round trip ticket, you can hop off at any stop, then catch it on the way back. It's a very scenic ride. Tons of gorgeous homes tucked up on the hillsides with eye popping views! The whole circuit takes about five to six hours, and they have an early morning run and an early afternoon run. Don't visit Istanbul without taking the Bosphorus Cruise. Then to top it off, I stayed in a hotel with stunning views when you get a room on the Bosphorus side. And they have a HUGE balcony that you can sit out and watch the chaotic, aquatic show that is traffic on the Bosphorus. That hotel is the Hilton. Great hotel great staff, and that balcony to really enjoy it. There are bigger, all glass hotels with great views nearby, but not one room has a balcony.  Seeing the Straits as I did was an experience of a lifetime for me."

There is a 90 min cruise to the end of the strait. It has several stops where you can exit. If you are lucky you can see dolphins. If you go to the end, you end up in a small village (with several restaurants), from where you can walk to a castle on a hill. You can take the boat or bus back into town. The first boat back is at 3 pm, what means that you have to wait in the village for 3 hours if you took the 10.30 am boat. You can also take the bus 15a back (transfer in for example Kanlica, take a bus or dolmus to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar and from there take a ferry back to Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, or transfer). If you just want to see the skyline of the city, you may as well take a ferry to/from \u00dcks\u00fcdar."

As we went up the Bosphorus it was amazing to see even more mosques and old historic buildings, residences up the hillside and cafes on the water. The tour was narrated but at times it was difficult to understand. As we reached the half way point we turned around at the old fort defenses which protected the straits of old. Coming back into port one has a wonderful view of Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque...priceless."

We took the trip up the Bosphorus from Eminonu on a dull day but still really enjoyed the experience, staying in the Sullivan for warmth and popping out to take photographs. The kiosk where you buy your tickets is the last one before the Galata Bridge, so be prepared to run the gauntlet of enthusiastic boatman trying to sell you their version of the trip. At 25 Turkish lira the official ferry is very good value. It is worth paying for the audio guide, which has a wealth of information to help you appreciate the buildings on either side of the waterway. Don't forget to take some form of personal identity e.g. passport or driving licence, to leave as a deposit for your audio guide. At the time of our visit, there was plenty of room on board but I can visualise that it would get very busy in high summer; in which case arrive early to secure a ticket.The boat mostly hugs the European side with occasional stops on the Asian shore. Part of the fascination is to see the ocean going container ships and cruise liners being piloted through the Straits. The voyage each way takes about one and a half hours and the boat then stops for lunch at a little town on the Asian shore. There isn't a lot to do here. Most people make fairly stiff climb up to a partly ruined castle(which is not open for visiting)but has extensive views of the Bosphorus,with the city in the distance and, in the other direction, the Black Sea. Most then chose a fish restaurant on the front at which to have a good value lunch. There are several places to choose from and your custom will be actively sought by the staff!"

You can rent a audio guide for 5 TL, but very few passengers rented one.The longer option takes 6 hours, at either 10:35 or 1:35 (or 10:35 or 13:35), including a 2-hr stop for meal and/or sightseeing on your own.There are also commercial boats (Tuyol, I believe) that costs 12 TL and lasts for 1.5 hours that offer more frequently service: hourly service on weekdays, and more frequent service on weekends and holidays.Of course there are many other options, including private boats."

You get a good 2 hours travel but no commentry. I liked that. The views are beautiful and the houses lovely, go in April when all the blossoms are out. A much better journey than the Cairo boat trip. The boat was the one directly oppiste the underpass at Emminou. Get drinks beforehand as the ones on board. Make sure you are on the port side as it always keeps this side towards the shore."

The waterline architecture is very interesting and you simply do not get the same view from the bus tours. You also pay less, especially if you find an official guide and barter over the price. 20 Turkish lire is a fair price. Even in April the sun can be quite strong so be ready with sun cream or lotion. Our boat did not have a bar but they did provide free tea. It stopped for an hour at a local riverside resort where you could have a stroll around or visit the fortress."

Get tickets at the end of the quay, the last building before the Galata bridge. Get there in time so you can choose a good seat on the upper deck. The tour takes you a good distance up the river, with many things to see along the way. Vendors provide tea, coffee, ice-cream, and there's a cafeteria on the lower deck.

There you can hike up a huge hill to an ancient castle (with great views of the Black Sea), and then walk down and eat lunch in a nice little outdoor restaurant. Go to Eminonu and walk along the waterfront to find the public ferry stand (just don't get suckered into hopping on one of the tourist ferries as you try to find it).

This time in 2012 we went on a tourist cruise which went up and back, with our guide who told us what the various buildings and landmarks were as we motored past. Both were worthwhile although in both cases we were in istanbul at Easter and it was showery and cool. Well worth doing. If you do have the time, take the local ferry which costs very little.

Wow! a great palace in a great location, just on bosphure strait.. went there because I heard about it from friends, and they also told me that it will be a long que waiting.. and yeah.. waited for an hour till we got our tickets but it wasn't bad because the weather was so nice in April, not hot.. I won't recommend it in summer but in this month of the year. It's really nice to visit Istanbul in April because also you'll see toulip roses everywhere. The tickets for adults is 40Lira.. that is if u want to see the 2 palaces there.. if u want to see just one palace so it's only 30 Lira.. kids below 7 is free, from 7- 12 u have to pay only 7 turkish lira. When u enter the first big door, the gate door, you'll say: wow.. what a beautiful garden, and you'll tell yourself: I'd pay this 40Lira just to see this garden, even if I didn't see the palace! you're not allowed to take pictures inside the palace but it's a huge palce which is worth yr visit.. in one sentence I'd say: if u didn't see this place in Istanbul.. u saw nothing in Istanbul, a great place to visit.. the place has also a nice cafe, restaurant on bosphure outside the palace gate.. it's one of the best places which I visited this year."

The trip back was difficult, since we took double the time (boat had to stop by 5 islands before we arrive). That was certainly not a perfect day to go for a Cruise! P.S.

The local ferry system is quite extensive and a ride costs around 2-4 Lira...this is very cheap compared to the cruise prices I've seen on this collection of reviews which went from 15 up to 55 Euro. Still, our ferry was just transportation from one side to another and we then found places to eat when we alighted. Most tourist maps list where the ferry ports are, but if not, if you're near water, look for quick walking local citizens-they'll probably be headed for the nearest ferry port. Eminou is the easiest to find because it's a major tourist hub.The one caution is that I never did quite figure out how the written destinations matched the ferries and had a couple of detours along the way. Once I thought I was going back to Eminou (that's what I thought it said on the ferry anyway) and ended up going over to the Asia side, so I hopped on another ferry and got the the most amazing photography opportunities as we crossed over the Bosphorus again, so it was a happy accident. Another time I was coming back from the Prince's Islands and we passed Eminou again! We got off on the Galata side and caught a tram back to Eminou. Anyway, it wasn't a big deal since we were on vacation, but be prepared for the occasional detour if you get on the local ferries."

The standard tourist tour (at 15TL; 25TL return) is clearly not worth it. It takes a full day (10:30-17:00) and is not particularly exciting. It is a straightforward tourist attraction.A much better alternative is to cross the Bosphorus with the regular ferry to the Asian part of Istanbul (2TL). We went from Karakoy (at the Galata bridge) to Kadikoy, where we spend some time. We went back from Kadikoy to Besiktas. You get the same views of Istanbul (both the old town, the Dolmabace palace and the bridge), but it costs less money, it takes much less time, it is the same type of boat, and you are not surrounded by tourists.Alternatively, one can take the bus (or taxi) half way up the Bosphorus. Particularly the Sakip Sabanci Museum is worth the trip (check the exhibitions). Bebek is a lively little town as well.

Getting a good seat is a bit competitive as many, many, many people will rush on the boat. Many more will think nothing of blocking your view to take photos. If you can get over the rudeness of human nature, you will greatly enjoy this trip. Bring something warm to wear and the breeze gets cold as you get closer to the Black Sea."

You can do it in as little as 1.5 hours.You set out from one of several ferryboat docks, including the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc ferryboat docks (on the Golden Horn between Galata Bridge and Sirkeci Station), Kabata\u015f docks, Be\u015fikta\u015f docks, or \u00dcsk\u00fcdar docks and head north toward the Black Sea. The most impressive sights are along the southern shores of the Bosphorus, nearest to the city: Topkap\u0131 Palace, the mid-Bosphorus Maiden's Tower, the Selimiye Barracks (where Florence Nightingale worked), Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace, \u00c7ira\u011fan Palace, Y\u0131ld\u0131z Park & Palace, the chic art-boutique-and-cafe scene in the village of Ortak\u00f6y.It is really something we must do in Istanbul.Unforgetable."

In summer time it will be welcome chance to get a breeze and cool down. Don't get ripped off, there are so many touts offering different cruises.

So many ticket touts try to sell you the more expensive outing and it's not worth it if you are remotely interested in the local people.Also worth using is the ferry to the Asian side - again not a single other British tourist and again amazing value at 2 lira each way.

You'll get to see palaces, mansions, little towns & locals (mostly kids) jumping & swimming in the Bosphorus. The bridges are all gorgeous as well. However, I'd like to advice travelers not to order seafood in the restaurants because I had food poisoning. When I went to a pharmacy to ask if it were a common occurence, the personnel admitted that food poisoning is not uncommon from eating seafood taken from the Bosphorus. Have fun!"

It went all the way up to the second bridge (Fatih Sultan Mehmet) that links the European side to the Asian side of the city and then it came back.

We did do a specific tour through a private operator for a good 3 hours doing the day-time, and than later we did sail through the Bosphorus for our Princess Island tour.It is an amazing tour, and we did both of them during the day time (the return leg of the Princess Island tour was at night, but we were too tired to enjoy the sail and bothered more of reaching our hotel room at the earliest!).I guess if the weather condition would have suited us better, we would have loved to sail in the evening also, and take in the magnificent views of the huge Bosphorous Bridge which are beautifully lit at night. The Bosphorous Strait literally separates Asia from Europe, so there is this interesting fact to the ferry tour too.There are interesting views on both sides of the Strait, with some nice landscape to look out for. Specially on the European side, you can see the Gulata tower and the adjoining neighborhood which has historical era buildings.A word of advice: the winds are very strong out there usually, and it is strongly recommended that you carry an extra jacket or pashmina for ladies. If you taking children with you, suggest you take a ferry that has both an outdoor platform as well as an indoor covered area, where you can secure the kids from the heavy winds incase they find it uncomfortable."

The traffic on the water is continually fascinating, and the 1.5-2.00 break at turnaround point just shy of the Black Sea is good for a seafood meal at one of the open air, waterside cafes.

Enjoy the beautiful old yet renovated houses (millions of dollars worth), beautiful parks, fishing men from the sea... Get your camera ready for the beautiful scenes..

The ferry stops several times along the way, but we wanted to see the Black Sea so we stayed on till the last stop. Just watching the palaces, bridges, and neighborhoods go by is fascinating but what really was amazing to me was watching all the commercial and fishing vessels that travel back and forth on a daily base. Definitely an experience that needs to be done. Once we got to Anadolu Kacagi the ferry stopped there for 3 hours and with time to kill we climbed to the top of the hill were we explored the ruins of the Yoros Kalesi which was a castle first built by the Byzantines. The view from there is extraordinary, you can see from the Black Sea, all the way down the Bosphorus Strait, to the Sea of Marmara. We took tons of pictures! After the ruins we walked back down to the small fishing village and enjoyed a great fish lunch at one of the restaurants along the port. The 3 hours passed really quickly and before we knew it was time to go back to the ferry. All in all it took about 6 hours for the whole trip, but it was an amazing day!"

Boat goes to Anadolu Kavagli, which has very little other than restaurants with aggressive pitchment. Recommend jumping off at Sariyer.... the ship stops for pickup the the return.

We took the trip starting at 10.30, which involves a 1.5-hour trip up to the Black Sea, where there's a 3-hour stop at Anadolu Kavagi, returning to the starting point at 4.30. We went in October, and it was cold on the boat, so take something warm if you want to sit outside where the best views are. Having a guide book of some kind will mean you get the most out of the trip, as there are many points of historical interest along the way. We had a Lonely Planet. To pass the time at Anadolu Kavagi, it's worth walking up to the ruined fortress (which you can't enter) for great views of the Black Sea, but it's a very steep hike, so only for the reasonably fit. I couldn't have done it in mid-summer. Back down in town, we went to a restaurant called Baba on the far left as you enter the port, where we sat by the water and had very good calamari and mezes."

Walking under the subway to the cross to the other end there is interesting road-side shopping. The tickets for teh 2 hour ferry we took were TL 10 (I think). The Ritz concierge recommended this over the night cruise and we think it was the right choice. The boat follows the right bank first with Ayasofia,Blue Mosque, Topkapi on the right. Get on the upper deck and get a seat. Have warm clothes. The crowd is pretty easy so even if you don't have a seat, they will let you stand at the railings. Carry some bread for the sea gullsGet the audio guide, the guide and the map are well worth it since there are so many buildings that you tend to get lost without it. The seaside homes of royalty and really nice and all are different. On the way back, you see the other bank with the Dolmache palaces.Plan this so that you are returing during sun-set. We saw the sun-set over the Blue Mosque and Sofia. It is a superb sight. In winter the sun-set was around 4:30-5.00 pmThe ferry leaves right opposite the Spice Market so you can go to the market before the ferry and then get on to the ferry"

The boat takes a more direct route now with fewer stops which is better. There is a great deal of interest to see on route especially on the European side and at one stop Kanlica they bring on fresh yoghurt locally produced for sale.It is fresh on board so be prepared with warm clothes whatever the season There is Coffee and Chai for sale throughout the trip and a small shop with food.At the tip of the Bosphorus there is a three hour stop at anadolu Kavagi where you can visit a ruined castle which has been fenced off now so you cant go inside which is probably as well as the drops were spectacular.You can either take a steep walk up if you are fit it is short but very steep or there are taxis which will take you up and wait at the top to take you down negotiate the fee in advance. There is a cafe at the top but we were plagued with wasps and most people just take in the views and have a meal near the ferry drop off.There are lots of fish restaurants and lots of people touting for your business. You have to decide on whether you want a waterside view or a view from a high terrace.Most are good quality but can be pricey. Walking along the waterfront a bit can pay off .Overall its a great day out and the views are spectacular"

This was showed the Asian and European sides and how great some of theses houses and apt\u00b4s are just sitting on top with such an incredible view.\nBeautiful October day but it was freezing on top, stay there for 20 minutes and go downstairs -- same view, a lot warmer.\nWorth the money too."

We did the full day trip (10:30 am - 4:30 pm) where you spend 3 hours at the end (on the Asia side) and have lunch, and can visit shops or hike to the old fort. Others we spoke with did 1/2 tours. It is cheaper and easy to just book it yourself and go to the port. If you want to get picked up at your hotel and eat on the boat instead of on-land, book one of the tours."

In the end we got off and got a taxi back. Note if you are doing one way and hoping to get back by bus you need a blue card as the don't use tickets any more."

They will give you a map with a few sites decribed or we used the Rick Steve Istanbul book which also discribes the route...although some stops have changed. Ride the ferry to the end. You will then have about a 3 hr. \"lay-over\". The tour guide boats will tell you this is BORING but it is NOT. It is enough time to hike up to the fort or have a leisurely lunch, or both. We really enjoyed the day on the water.Note: it is VERY windy and cooler as you get near the Black Sea. You'll be gald to have a wrap."

Cruise through Bosphorus strait gives excellent view of Istanbul city specially at night when the ship passes through all the monuments and buildings on either side giving great view of Dolmabache palace, Rumeili fortress, Sultanahmet district and the high minarets on the skyline. Must see."

I was astounded to learn by observing the locals, that I could enjoy crusing those two water areas for mere 3.50 Turkish Lira. You need to decide which part of Istanbul you wish to visit, eg. Uskudar, then you walk along the harbour to check which boats go there(there are huge signs). Outside the 'stalls' are money machines(I believe you need COINS ), you place 2 T.L. and out comes your change and a TOKEN. You use that to get a 1 way ride. You can save time and queues by purchasing a second token for the way back. Just ensure you enter the correct gate(for your destination) as they don't give you a refund. You'll have to buy another token. Last year I didn't know and the same trip cost me in excess of 60euros, instead of 3.50 Turkish Lira!!!!!"

It leaves at 10:35 from the Bogaz Iskelesi terminal just opposite the Eminonu tram stop. A round-trip ticket costs 20 TL and takes about 5-6 hours (there's a 2-3 hour stop at the furthest point). The ferrys are comfortable with plentiful seating inside and out. After several days of walking all over the city it was great to be able to sit outside in the breeze and watch the scenery go by. It really gives you a sense of how big the city is."
