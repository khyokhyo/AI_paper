I long for this place as soon as I come back. Spending at least a few days here is so far one of the best things you can do for yourself. It is considered among the most important monasteries of Mahayana-Gelug tradition of Buddhism where resident monks constantly practice and chant mantras all day. If you are looking for a highly-spiritual, calm, tranquil time and learn what Tibetan Buddhism is from great great teachers, Kopan should be your destination. Om Mani Padme Hum!"

This is a visit you can also easily do on your own, you do not need a guide unless you really want one. There is no admission fee, a taxi from the Thamel will probably run you about 500 Rupees each way. This is a fairly new Monestary, so it's not like you need a guide to explain all the history here, it is more of a working Monestary and School. Bring a picnic and eat out in the beautiful gardens. Or better yet, schedule to take one of their classes, that will be my net trip here, definitely worth multiple visits. This place is pretty magical, inspirational, friendly and very scenic. Not just the beauty of the monastery , but the grounds are kept immaculate, beyond anywhere else I have visited, especially in Nepal. They have a restaurant (vegetarian) here, that is very clean and has gorgeous views of the entire Kathmandu valley. Service and food are average, but this obviously helps support the monastery. You can take silent meditation classes here, for a week or ten days if you are strong enough. I believe they also teach basic Dharma classes as-well. This is also a destination for visiting monks from other countries. IN the past they did not allow photographs within the main Monestary, that has changed, and you may now take photos at least when the hall is not in use. My suggestion would be a donation of about 20-50 Rupees per picture, you can just leave it at the base of the Dali Lama's picture. There is a gift shop and bookstore with very reasonable prices, and a very extensive selection of books, mostly in English. Also a Receptionist who can walk you through the various options if you wish to stay here. When you visit, get here in the morning, there is a security guard, and he will have you sign in, and give you a guest pass, there is no charge for visiting. However everything, possibly even the front gate closes between 11:30 and 1:00 or 1:30, so plan that time for your lunch break and wait for the monastery to re-open in the afternoon for further exploration. A truly wonderful place to visit, top 5 probably in the Kathmandu valley, at least for me."

It Is a great place, a bit of a hassle to get to, but the advantage of this is less tourist ( like myself) , when you leave, with the gate to the back of you, take the little path to your right down the hill, a lovely walk, get you back to the main roads to get a taxi"

Ours was given by Monk Tingyal. It was poignant and thought provoking. The group of students enjoyed the talk the most. They have a lovely book store on the premises. They sell a variety of books, CDs, DVDs, pashminas, singing bowls, and various Buddhist materials (prayer flags, door hangings, prayer beads, etc.) The prices are much more reasonable than anywhere else in Kathmandu. They have a lovely area to enjoy lunch. The menu was much more extensive than just dhal bhaat (which surprised me).Truly a wonderful way to spend your morning.

Many people wonder whether favourite places such as Kopan Monastery will look the same as before the quakes therefore it was a wonderful to visit Kopan on the weekend and find it looked as splendid as ever with very little damage to see. The main temple looks magnificent and most of the accommodation and other buildings are fine. The gardens and the stupa area look glorious in the spring. Kopan is set high on the hills behind Boudha and you can walk there, take a taxi or local bus. Kopan is a Gelug monastery and runs meditation and Buddhist courses and these have now started again. From Kopan there is a great half hour walk on a well made trail along the ridge to Pullahari Monastery with panoramic views of Kathmandu Valley. A visit to Kopan with the walk to Pullahari takes about 3 hours."

It is situated above Kathmandu and away from the hustle and bustle of the traffic in town. The views are superb and the gardens beautifully laid out. We enjoyed a meal at the cafe before wandering through the gardens and extensive grounds. The library and bookshop were very interesting and we saw many study groups in action around the monastery. I would like to spend more time at Kopan and find out more about what they have to offer. My overwhelming impression was of a welcoming and accepting community where you can find space for reflection and solitude."

It drops you off in the village and I was fortunate enough to have a local walk with me to show me the direction to the monastery. Otherwise look up what it looks like beforehand as you can see it on the hills and can also figure your way out that way also. It is quite the steep uphill walk took me probably another 45 minutes from drop off to monastery. You can also catch a cab if you don't want to walk. Do not wear shorts as I saw a girl get rejected at the entrance even though they were to her knees. This place is absolutely a lovely retreat perched atop the city. Lovely views. You cannot enter the actual monastery however. There is a cafe and a library there that has odd hours so it may be closed. A very interesting stupa with tons of relics also. Enjoy the temple grounds here. If you are feeling adventurous like I was I am not sure of the name but there is a huge red temple atop a hill in very clear view from here. You can walk there in 30 minutes on a lovely scenic dirt path. Ask locals the direction of \"Pulahari\" and you will come to a clear blue and red archway that says welcome. Then a steep uphill to get there but I found the monastery itself more impressive than Kopan it was stunning. Another 30 minutes from here is Pulahari a third monastery not as impressive as the other two in my opinion however. A monk informed me these temples used to be open for people to enter but the insides are so damaged now and are being reconstructed. All these temples had lovely views and scenic paths full of prayer flags to each destination."

I strolled around inside, keeping clear of an area where signs said a retreat was going on and wound up at the highest point in the monastery grounds where there is a wonderfully sculptured park with peaceful sitting areas all around. After capturing some of the beauty with my camera I sat down on a bench and meditated. Someone sat down near me and then more came and I realized I was in the middle of a discussion group from the retreat.

The best way to get here, by foot, is to just follow the street that seems to be going in the right direction. The Kopan can be seen on the hilltop from almost anyplace in this side of Kathmandu, so it would be hard to get lost. Occasionally there is a small sign tacked to a pole that states 'Kopan Monastery', with an arrow. But these are few and far between. Once you get close to the structure, there is a little path that winds its way up the hillside to the top of the hill. There are some grand gates here that, for us, were barring entrance - as there was either some very important ceremony going on, or the construction near the gate to repair the earthquake damage was too concerning to allow tourists inside.However, there is a another gate just 30 seconds back down the road, directly behind you as you face the main archway. It is large, and has no signage. You just knock on the door. A guard opens up a small sub door, makes sure you are not wearing any leather and that the girls have their shoulders covered - we you're in.The monastery is wonderful, the grounds are spectacular, and the views of the city are well worth the hike. There is also a little store and cafe next to a small patio that overlooks Kathmandu. It was all very magical, as the clouds boiled up and gave us a wonderfully dramatic sky for our visit. The interior of the monastery is so complex, colorful, and ornate - perfectly Buddhist."

The views are very good and the air a little cleaner than down in the valley (a welcome respite from the city's pollution).It is worth checking that it is open before heading up there because it can be closed if they have a busy course or retreat - phone the reception."

I spent the day of my Father's 'death anniversary' here.I wanted to find time for myself and experience meditation with others, have peace, and find whatever I seem to looking for. I got a taxi from The Radisson in Kathmandu- my taxi driver tried so hard to convince me that he should stay and wait for me, but I sent him away (BIG MISTAKE!).Anyway, the monks were in meditation in the big hall, so I sat and meditated, chanted with them........wonderful, except for the number of people who seemed intent on taking pictures/videos rather than being in the moment. I sat for hours, and was included in the water giving and really relaxed and joined in. It was quite simply lovely. I then went for a walk around the gardens, which are amazing, made especially special by the monks, meditating, playing games and just being here, who add to the special feeling.I had a packed lunch with me, so at about 3pm I decided to head off home.....and find a taxi.....none to be seen. The gate man advised me to follow the monks, who were walking down to Bodhnath, but being my own and my first day in Kathmandu I was really nervous. When I asked about the bus (aka lonely planet guide) I was told that would be the next day. I had felt quite relaxed as there were so many 'westerners/tourists' there, but found out they were mainly on organised retreats/longer stay, not day visitors.So, panic set in!I felt a real failure as my only option was to ring the hotel and get them to send a taxi!I went back into the gardens to try to dissipate the panic and 'asked the universe' to get me to Bodhnath. I know this sounds like rubbish.....but after about an hour I went back to the main gates, and there was a taxi bringing back some monks. I reserved it, went back inside and asked if anyone else wanted a lift. There was one other chap (Australian) in the same boat as me, so we went halves and got down to Bodhnath.I am sure now that following the monks would have been an Ok thing to do, just dusty and pretty busy, so even for a now hardened, Kathmandu tourist, not sure I would choose to do it.SO, for the cost, if had my time again, I would ask my taxi man to wait for me! In summary. A WONDERFUL escape from Kathmandu, and if you have your exit planned, you would have a lovely day of meditation in a perfect environment, with lovely monks and superb gardens...and a feeling which is hard to describe.. a peace and connection with the closest I think it is possible to get to Tibetan monks as a tourist with a short time as your disposal.PS: * Food is spasmodic* English speaking Monks not a given* Toilets are squat, bring your own paper* Plan for transport"

It was a about 45min drive from our hotel in Durbag Marg. The uphill climb was a bit rocky with poor roads, but it passes by villages and you get a glimpse of the life around. You will see monks going up and down the hill. The guard at the entrance gate was not ready to allow us in and luckily we met a monk entering the monastery. He gladly agreed to take us inside and also explained what to see. We were told that all the monks had gone to Bodhnath Stupa. We were all by ourselves at that time. It was such a peaceful environment. We spent time going around the beautiful garden at the back where you will find a couple of stupas and then the main meditation hall and the souvenir shop.It is nice break from the chaotic Kathmandu. You get nice view of the valley and Bodhnath Stupa. Definitely worth a visit!"

We requested that we would like to be shown around, and a nice monk promptly obliged. We saw the main building, the school, canteen, gardens etc etc. There is a small shop and a restaurant also inside. We made a small donation at the end. The whole place is very quiet, and you get a lot of information about Buddhism. In addition you can see little kids who will spend some years here in the school.

The Kopan (Tibetan, Buddhist) Monastery lies in the outskirts of Kathmandu (a 45 minute drive), atop a hill that rises over the valley. I'd imagine it's not the easiest place to find in Kathmandu. Entry is free and certain courtesies, expected. A Muslim and mostly ignorant when it comes to Buddhism, I can only comment on the aesthetics. Kopan is a complex of monasteries, shrines (?), a nunnery, cafeteria and I guess what could be called 'retreats'. The shrines are a shimmering Golden and adorned with intricate designs. The hilltop offers a great view of the Kathmandu valley. There are shade-trees for a quick read, or gazebos for quiet meditation. The 'retreats' are restricted area for tourists since they're likely to disturb the peace of monks and trainees. A lot of Europeans / Westerners come here for spiritual guidance and peace of mind and can often be seen with their cleaning-buckets, mops or gardening tools - working tirelessly and happy as clams.Great place to visit for 2/3 hours of quiet. A chat with a local monk makes it even more special."

The site has a number of well preserved buildings used for Buddhist prayers and rituals. Lots of Buddhists on site shuffling around in their traditional red garb.

No all is modern, very clean, with good restaurant and modern commodities (even cybercafe). The garden around is amazing and the view is 360 degrees over the Valley. Smoking, drinking and sex are prohibited as well as lying, stealing, harming living beings, and personal internet, and it is an excellent place for retreat, deep thinking, reading in the high class library and meditation. Deep courses are regularly given. You find yourself between hundreds of boy-monks received modern and traditional Buddhist education."

It was definitely a serene yet quite spot high up in the mountain away from the hustle and bustle of the city down below in Kathmandu. As I reached there, I went towards the Garden of Silence which had beautiful Pagodas built and was highly taken aback by the craftsmanship in the monuments that were built. It is a beautiful garden which is extremely quiet and the fresh green atmosphere gave me an opportunity to spend some time in silence and prayer. The only unfortunate part was that I could not spend too much time inside the Temple as there was some maintenance work that was about to start. But if you are really looking for a spot to relax your mind and body then the Kopan Monastery is definitely a place to go and visit and spend a few hours there as well."

We had arrived in time for a special gathering that to this day we don't know the origin off or reason for. There were monks and locals everywhere. We had about twenty minutes of peaceful strolling through the gardens before the amount of locals and monks let us know that there was something big going on. So we followed the stream of monks from the gardens and lo and behold in the courtyard in front of the main temple there they all sat. Facing a small stage that was occupied by senior monks wearing fabulous yellow head dresses armed with mics and ruling on what seemed to be mock complaints from other monks. There was hand slapping, shoving, pushing, raised voices and laughing. You cannot miss the monastery. Even on a busy day it was still peaceful...and free too.

In the end I think it was good for me to get an overview of Tibetan Buddhism as a religion and I can now integrate the pieces that are valuable for me into my philosophy. I would recommend others to take this course but to be prepared that they really present the whole Buddhist worldview as entirely literal, and it doesn't always fit with a western scientific worldview. It was really interesting though and I enjoyed discussions with the other course participants."

As soon as I reached there, there was such a peaceful, calm and positive atmosphere, that I knew this place was something special. The course itself gives a clear overview of all the major concepts in buddhist philosophy.The other participants in the group were amazing. We had people from 20 different countries representing all 6 continents. The sheer diversity made the course so much more rich.The rooms were better than that in the Hilton! We stayed in the Tsongyi house which had a lavish bedroom, bathroom, hall cum kitchen. So clean and so nice. The food there is to die for! So yummmy! They had everything - pizza, pastas, chinese, tibetan, american, burgers. sandwiches, all indian items. And it's so cheap too! Can go there just to eat again haha.The 4 teachers teaching the course were all amazing. I thank them from all my heart for the teahcing and fun we had during the teachings. The tibetan lama especially made the learning so much fun. He would laugh and laugh and make us all laugh during the course.The entire community of monks who live there are so nice. There are monks of all ages - from 2 year olds to 70 year olds. They are so kind and have such a good humour. The library is amazing! Has soo many books and the librarian is the most kind one you'll ever meet. The views from the monastery are breathtaking. It's on top of a hill and you can see the valley below 360 degrees. The best part - the monastry has 5 dogs who are the most peaceful loving and cute dogs ive met (they never bark and never bite so don't worry about that) and one of the dogs would keep coming into our gompa (the place where we would study), sit on of the cushions right in the middle of all of us and listen to the entire teachings and meditiations!!! Imagine that! Everytime the teaching sessions would start he would come in and take a seat! Wow so amazing!If you want to change your life or need a 'mind spa' or want to refresh your soul or just want to get away and find yourself again there is no better place than this. Needless to say I will be going back there many times again!"

We took a taxi up to Kopan from Thamel - inexpensive and an interesting drive with some 'goat track' roads up the mountain - and the driver was happy to wait while we did our visit. The Monastery and the surrounding compound are beautiful and well worth a visit - there are lovely walks around well kept gardens and the atmosphere is one of calm and serenity. The monastery offers Budddhist retreats and programs, a bookshop, a cafeteria. You must stay away from the areas where people are on retreat. There is a local restaurant nearby as well. The views from the Monastery compound are stunning and beautiful - 360 views. I'd love to come and stay here for a retreat sometime. Driving back you can make a stop at Kopan Nunnery - this is also a great spot where Buddhist nuns are schooled and trained from as young as 6 years. The compound and temples here are lovely and the nuns hand-make incense from Himalayan flowers for purchase. They keep the big gate of the nunnery shut - so you may think it's closed, but just knock on the side door and you will be welcomed in (they open the gates for your taxi driver to park). Lots to look at, experience and learn at Kopan"

Beautiful views of Kathmandu and an Oasis out of city's dust and noise. Follow the monks routine and get plenty of time to reflect about life's meanings."

Some interesting and colourful paintings on the front of some of the buildings, but the treat lies at the back with the lovely gardens and a few incredibly ornate stupas. Also, an interesting rock garden with miniature bronze figures depicting the key points in the life of the Buddha. A pleasant enough walk away from Bodnath. Come here first and then head to Bodnath for early late afternoon(4pm). Could also be combined with a visit beforehand to Gokarna Mahadev Temple."

In 1971 Lama Zopa Rinpoche, the reincarnation of the Lawudo Lama, a yogi of the tiny hamlet of Lawudo, fulfilled the promise of the previous Lawudo Lama to start a monastic school for the local children. The school was called called it Mount Everest Center. Twenty five monks moved down from the mountain to Kopan in 1971 - prompted by the harsh climate at an altitude of 4000 am, which made study barely possible in winter.Now Kopan is a thriving monastery of 360 monks, mainly from Nepal and Tibet, and a spiritual oasis for hundreds of visitors yearly from around the world. Nearby is Khachoe Ghakyil Ling Nunnery, home to 380 nuns. Both the monastery and the nunnery are under the spiritual guidance of Lama Zopa Rinpoche, and the care of the abbot, Khen Rinpoche Geshe Lhundrup Rigsel. And it is the wellspring of the FPMT, a network of some 140 centers and activities world-wide, themselves expressions of the Buddha activity of Lama Thubten Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche"

The day we went there was a ceremony in progress with the main monk being a woman. Not sure what it was all about but there were lots of bowls of food on a table which other monks were handing to her, could have been a blessing for the harvest. I will never know. The monastery is right on top of a hill with a lovely view over the Kathmandu valley, The gardens are lovely and there are two stupas which are decorated and colourful. People can go there to a retreat so there are places you cannot go but it was great to witness a working monastery and hear the young monks chanting prior to their having lunch. Missed out on going to the bookshop though as the whole place closes for lunch. If you get a chance to go, make sure you do it."

Kopan is superb value and a stunningly beautiful and serene spot on the planet. Situated on a small mountain top just outside Kathmandu with views of the city, the valley and the mountains, its not difficult to be taken in by its beauty and fall in love with Kopan, I found. The calm and beauty of early morning sun rises is life long lasting memories. The unfolding buddhist life from the hundreds of monks is ever present. My board was in single room with shared bathroom fascilities. Sparse but clean and nothing was I missing. Three generous and surprisingly good meals per day plus tea and fresh, drinkable water. The Course was nothing short of world class with teachers knowing their stuff, schedules kept with punctuality on start & finish, good study material and a fantastic library. All monks in shops, reception, library speak very impressive English. In total I paid USD 137.00 all inclusive for my 14 days at Kopan - the best money I have spend in 35 years of travelling in more than 100 countries. I have promised myself to return within one year and I will do my best to keep that promise. Kopan is heaven down here."

It is strictly for foreigners. Nepalis living abroad are OK, just not Nepalis living in Nepal. He said that is the official policy. We were stopped because I was with an American of Indian descent (who therefore, from appearance, could be Nepali). Upon proving foreign status we were let in. I thought he was just checking ID for everyone at this time, but on our way out, we saw that he did not ask the white tourists to prove ID, and also turned back a Nepali guy. That's when I questioned him and found out about the policy. I asked for the reason and he said that Nepalis can make the place dirty. It pains me to write this about this amazing place, but I hope they can work out a better policy after seeing this review. The current policy is not moral, IMO. The toilets could also be cleaner, but that's nothing compared to the point raised above."

The schedule was pretty packed - from 6am to 9pm most days, with a break in the middle of the day, but I didn't find it was too much. The teachings were so interesting and really helped me to understand the nature of the mind, attachment and suffering. The daily group discussions were also a highlight as you get to hear the way others perceive things which really makes you think about your own perceptions. The grounds at Kopan are beautiful and it's so nice to hear the monks' chanting in the mornings and evenings. The library is really well stocked and there are so many interesting texts to read. I found the morning and evening practice of silence really calming, although unfortunately some people in the group couldn't stick to it. The food at Kopan was so much better than I expected and was different almost every day. The accommodation I had wasn't great...I was in a very hot shared room at the back of the property next to the animals with hundreds of mosquitos (which you have to take a vow not to kill) and barking dogs, so make sure you take ear plugs. To be fair though, I signed up really late to the course so I was in the most basic of the accommodation. People who signed up early were in really nice rooms with private bathrooms and even had air-con which I had to try every day not to be envious of! The only bit of constructive criticism I'd give is that since it was a beginner's course, I would have liked the teachings to be more practical and explain how to incorporate them into my daily life and thought processes. I felt it was a little too focused on achieving enlightenment, which, to people who are just learning, seems like a lofty, far off goal. Other than that, the experience was so positive I am now considering doing the one month course in November."

For those who are only interested in meditation and not particularly in Buddhism, it is not the optimal place as only a minor part of the teachings is dedicated to meditation per se.Very enjoyable and blessed stay. Thank you"

There is a very nice library-shop that you can find so many books in english, cd's, souvenirs etc but in good quality and good prices but open on certain hours. You can also spend the night there and there is a mini market too. The temple is very beautiful with amazing colours and the gardens so well taken care of. It's better if you keep your taxi waiting for you as you can't find another one there."

I had really an amazing experience and perhaps one day I'll go back to do the same course. I can definitely recommend this Monastery and the course to anybody who is interested in Buddhism, regardless of the level of experience with Tibetan Buddhism. There were several people that were doing the course for the second or third time.The location is magical and the energy is just marvellous. Following the course with many other foreigners interested in learning Buddhist Meditation was very inspiring and be surrounded by Buddhist monks doing their practices was just awesome. One of the highlights of my stay was to visit the Gompa early in the morning where the monks where reciting the sutras and just sit there and enjoy the vibrations. I felt like being trance.You can find more info about Kopan, pictures and videos in this link:http://path2yoga.blogspot.com/2010/04/one-month-meditation-course-in-nepal.html"

Before I went I was a bit anxious about going on a retreat! It was my first one! Well I loved it so much, Kopan is the most calming peaceful place I have ever been too. And I have travelled a lot! There was 100 people on my Transforming your mind course from all around the world! Amazing! We all bonded so easy and after the first day or so we were like a family! If you want or need to heal yourself or just need to calm your mind! Well please just go to Kopan. The food is good home veggie cooking and plentyful. There is a coffee shop and a shop there too. Wear loose comfy clothing and they will do your washing for you too. The monks are amazing and the kids in the monastery are great. I took donations to them from my family and friends and they were so humble. After a week I spent a few dats sightseeing and had an amazing life changing experience! I will return one day and I want to take family and friends there too. I made lots friends and had a fablous spiritual journey that has made me think about life!!! Its the best thing I have ever done! All those fears and worries about going was a waste of energy! But I know that now! All i can say is go and find YOU! Enjoy and say a pray for me there! Blessings Love Cathy McCauley XXX"
