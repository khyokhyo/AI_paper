The piazza has numerous restaurants serving wine and / or meals. The drinks can be expensive but, if you ask the price of the house red or white before sitting down you will get a bottle from \u20ac15. We did! There are artists painting and selling their work by day and street artists by night."

Piazza Navona is quite centrally located, so definitely make it one of your stops whilst exploring the nearby pantheon whoch is much more crowded.Becasue this piazza is much larger, you don't feel like you're fighting for space with others. There are many restaurants surrounding the piazza but honeslty didn't try any. My suggestion would be to go to the nearby Pasticceria Cinque Lune, get an assortment of small pastries (sold by weight) and enjoy these overlooking the fountain. Thoroughly enjoyed strolling in the piazza at various times. There isn't much shade or seating space though."

It was wonderful then to while away the hours eating gelato and watching passers-by, and it is now. I spent a few hours there early this month and the magic hasn't died. 35-40 years later, it remains the beautiful, aged, majestic piazza it has been for hundreds of years. So so worth some time."

Still, easy to see why this is a top three spot to visit on any tour of Rome on foot. Judging by the money in the fountain, people are throwing their Euros away by the bucket full - no wonder Italy is in financial crises"

Once you've taken a couple of pictures of said fountains there's nothing else to do. It's described in the guide books as having street artists and things happening but all there was were a few artists all selling virtually the same paintings. Surrounded by restaurants all touting for business. Don't get drawn into any of them as we were as they are a rip off. 15 euros for 3 cans of Sprite!! Might be more interesting at night time with a bit more atmosphere"

The piazza has two beautiful fountains - Fontana del Moro [ Fountain of The Moor ] and Fontana del Nettuno [ Fountain of Neptune] but is actually dominated by the huge and impressive Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi { Fountain of the Four Rivers] It was completed in 1651 and represents the 4 known major rivers on the 4 known continents at that time.It is definitely worth some of your time."

My husband and I walked through the Navona in the early AM (around 7:15) and it was absolutely stunning. The piazza is so beautiful without all the crowds and I truly believe the monuments and buildings are under appreciated when so many people crowd into the area.I highly recommend visiting the location but do so in the AM when only a few other people are around - it is so so so worth it."

Tip: don't fall for the restaurants laid out around the piazza unless you want to pay too much for mediocre food! Instead, head over to Campo de' Fiori for some good eats. I greatly recommend staying at an AirBnB or hotel in this area, nothing beats chilling out at piazza navona, listening to street musicians, seeing the performers, and watching the people milling about at night after a long day of exploring the city!"

However, a visit in the day time is worth coming back for.There are the usual ring of restaurants around the plaza and the one we ate at was surprisingly good, with well-priced dishes and good wine. Unlike many other public squares in Florence or Venice, there is no cover charge or price-gouging. Though you expect it, these are definitely not tourist traps."

Definitively left me with a sour taste regarding my Rome trip, seems to have gotten worse over the years and it appears the government doesn't care..The evening time however, does bring with it some interesting street performers as well as artist with their paintings, potraits etc. There is also really nice gelato place not far away, which has 150 different varieties of gelato! It's called Della Palma Gelato. WORTH a visit :)One place that I would strongly recommend STAYING away from for a meal, is La Fraschetta, off the main square. Unfortunately this shares the name of a more reputable restaurant in the Travestere area. Every review of this place is terrible and our experience was no different, refer to this tripadvisor link:https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d3598432-Reviews-La_Fraschetta-Rome_Lazio.html"

I visited a lot of squares before, but Piazza Navona certainly tops the list of my favorites. The amazing thing about Piazzas of Italy is that you experience the artistic individuals that create the various forms of art. Whether it's singing, playing different musical instruments, drawing faces with funny looks. The fountain over there is breathtaking where you can just sit, relax and enjoy the atmosphere. Definately a must see spot when you visit Rome"

Stayed nearby at Hotel Navona and walked here every day of our visit. So many restaurants surrounding you can eat at a different one every day. Cobblestone streets make for difficult walking though but it's such an intrinsic part of the Italian experience it won't matter. Many sights are a short walk from here. Only downside is the number of panhandlers, who will walk away if you tell them no. It's just a way of life for them in a heavy tourist area."

Make sure that you wander round it more than once, it takes a lot of time to appreciate Bernini's skill and there is just so much detail to take in! For this fountain alone it's worth a visit. Be aware of the restaurants though, whilst well situated obviously they are of course massively over-priced and of questionable quality. I had a disappointing pizza in one of the restaurants there, it wasn't anywhere near as good as a pizza I had a day earlier in another restaurant situated just 2 minutes walk away in one of the small streets running off the piazza!"

However, after looking on trip advisor for recommendations on restaurants within the area me and my girlfriend preferred Navona Notte which was only a couple of streets back from the main square. Prices are typically more expensive from restaurants within the main square as it is genuinely what tourists will look for first and also with the view of the square right in front of you."

The largest of them is the central \"Fountain of the Four Rivers\". At the north end is the \"Fountain of Neptune\" with almost hypnotic horse eyes. At the south end is \"Moor Fountain\". Unfortunately we visited the piazza in the early afternoon on a very hot (90+ degree) day. Out in the piazza the heat was unbearable, so we walked down the western side where there was a bit of shade. To avoid this I would recommend visiting it either first thing in the morning, or in the late afternoon/early evening"

The outside cafe seating was full. The piazza itself is quite beautiful with the three fountains. At one end is the Fountain of the Moor and at the other end is the Fountain of Neptune. In the middle is Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers. Each of the nudes represents the principal rivers of the known continents. Be sure to take your time going around this fountain since each side is so different. Stop at one of the cafes or get a gelato and watch the people for a while"

There is a lion hidden in the center taking a drink from the fountain flanked by a tall carved palm tree. I took me two visits to notice it. There is a basilica on one side which is well worth your time to see. If you are hungry, one whole side is flanked with restaurants. But go one block off the square and you get very tasty food for a bit less price. If you need a taxi, there is a taxi stand just down the street off the Piazza to the right as you face the church. Note that at night you may wait 20 minutes or more."

It is central to absolutely anything, with the Colosseum in one direction and the Vatican City, the same distance in the opposite direction. Both places you can walk to and visit different historical sites along the way. Piazza Navona was special in itself."

Great places to eat, lots of people-watching opportunities, and a fantastic place to admire the artistry and detail contained in the river gods fountain sculpture.By day, it's a relaxing place and by night, street music entertains the crowds, artists of many kinds (including performing) put on shows, busy cafes attract visitors, and loads of people are out and about (including pick pockets).Mainly, it's the fountain that draws tourists into this large, rectangular plaza that has been a \"hub\" since the first century and Roman rule (it was the site of a \"circus\" or arena).Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi or Fountain of the Four Rivers is the site of a whole entire review of its own; it only plays a part (although major) in this plaza. Two other fountains are the fountain with the moor (wrestling with a dolphin) and the fountain of Neptune.This location comes highly recommended for a very pleasant place to rest, soak up the local ambiance, refresh and restore the body, and plan the afternoon's events. We recommend Caffe Barocco for drinks and pizza and exceptional service.It's a short walk from this square to the Pantheon, a must-see for all visitors to Rome."

The Fountain of the Four Rivers, located in Piazza Navona, was sculpted by Bernini in natural stone and marble. It was commissioned by Pope Innocent X. Besides an Egyptian obelisk, the fountain contains gods representing the four major rivers in 1651. The figure representing Europe\u2019s Danube River faces the obelisk. In the same area you can see the Papal coat of arms. Since the source of the Nile in Africa was unknown, the sculpture has a cloth over its face and a lion is nearby. River Ganges represents Asia has an ore with a snake around it. This was done to show the river was navigable. Finally, the sculptor representing the Americas is a statue sitting on a pile of coins representing the riches of this area of the world. Noteworthy of this sculpture is that it is falling backwards with one arm raised. It is believed the god is shading his eyes from the rays of sunshine. I think it is important to have a tour guide in order to know the meaning of this statue. A definite must see!"

I even had an apartment just off the piazza for a month, some time back.However, I walked through last month, with a friend from Rome who has taken a fascination in the city's antiquities. Effectively, I had a tour guide, which is something I've tended to avoid over the years.I wonder what I've missed!I was familiar with Bernini's statues, (though I didn't know he did all three in the piazza); what I didn't know was that Gustav Eiffel saw the largest, centre statue, and took that as his inspiration for the Eiffel Tower. A glance at the four legs makes that obvious, but (for me, anyway) only after it was pointed out.Similarly, I hadn't been familiar with story behind the building of Bernini's statues and the main church in the piazza. Two architects competed for all of the work, Bernini being awarded the statues, and someone else the church. The two men hated each other, and hence the character on the statue is shielding his face from the church, whilst the Blessed Mary atop the church averts her gaze, looking away from the statues.I do not normally post reviews of sites such as this, but add this to underline that a well-informed guide (person or book) can make a terrific difference....(Only 4 stars though, as I was subject to an attempted rip-off at one of the largest restaurants on the piazza, the waiter \"accidentally\" short-changing me 50 Euros.)"

We were on a wonderful walking tour that started at Piazza di Spagna, visited several sites including Trevi Fountain and Pantheon, and ended up at Piazza Navona in the early evening. It was a fun place to hang out. Reminded me a little of Jackson Square, with the many artists selling their paintings or doing portraits. A number of street vendors were around but they were not intrusive.The piazza is where you can view three fountains: the central one is the more famous Fountain of the Four Rivers by Bernini; and the two complementary fountains at each end of the piazza, the Fountain of Neptune and the Fountain of the Moor. There is also the attractive church of Sant'Agnese in Agone, next to the 4 Rivers fountain.There are several restaurants and cafes along the piazza. We ate dinner there. The food was good but expensive, as you pay a premium for the location and ambience."

The running track of the Stadium of Domitian gives it the unique shape that makes it both spacious and intimate. The Bernini fountain of the four rivers is a masterpiece, although completed in a rush to pacify impatient Innocent X; Bernini closed the curtains in his coach when he passed because he was so ashamed of it, but I can gaze quite happily; he won the competition by letting the viewer see space below the massive obelisk of Domitian. The Triton statue at the north end is another Bernini and balances the centre well, although the third statue is not as good. The piazza is loved by Romans and tourists, and people sit, eat, chat and promenade. A wonderful place to feel yourself in Rome."

Both the left and right side of the Piazza Navona are sprinkled with various restaurants offering the some of the best Italian dishes in Rome. The most obvious attraction is the very tall Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi water fountain and obelisk built in the 17th century. The water fountain was designed to represent water gods and the four major rivers of the four major continents at that time period. There is even the Sant\u2019 Agnese in Agone Basilica located right across the street on the west side of the Piazza free for visitors to explore and worship."

This is not the first time we have visited Navona but, this time it was much quieter possibly due to the Roman annual holidays. This made it much easier to take photos. An impressive, large Piazza with three magnificent fountains in the middle all worth close scrutiny for their fine detail. The outside of the Piazza is lined with cafes and restaurants. Having had lunch we had no need to frequent any of the establishments. I would imagine that the prices would be enough to make a Saint curse! As is with all establishments bordering famous landmarks.Just enjoy the architecture and absorb one of the most majestic Piazzas in Rome"

But it didn't matter either the high temperature or the fact that there is no shadow when the sun is high up in the sky. I just sat down on the rail around the lovely main fountain and watch the people and feel the place. You can also visit the cathedral from the piazza, eat something on one of the many terraces here or simply eat an Italian gellato . And don't forget to admire the fountains in the piazza with their splendid sculptures. As far as I am concerned, this square diserves its place as being one of the most beautiful in Rome."

We ended up eating at La Piccola Cuccagna which was on a laneway just outside the Piazza (it had shade and fan misters which were enticing).

This was a breathe of fresh air for us out of our whole trip to Rome we were hassled no end by street sellers, at the Piazza Navona there wasnt one seller in sight!!! We were able to take in the spectacular view of this breathtaking architecture, walk around looking at paintings that artists were selling of there own work, and werent hassled either by them!!! it was a pleasant relaxed day, and a must see attraction whilst visiting Rome."

Rome was our last European stop before flying home so we bought a seven day bus pass and tried to see as many attractions as could be reached by public transport (which is almost all attractions).Piazza Navona is a long-ish rectangle about 250 m long and 50 m wide. It contains four major art forms; three fountain statues and a magnificent church.At the northern end of the piazza is the Fontana del Nettuno (Neptune's fountain) depicting Neptune fighting off a large squid, surrounded by ladies and children and a horse that looks like it is trying to get away from the squid.In the centre is the Fontana del quattro Fiumi (Four rivers fountain) at the centre of which is a large obelisk around which four men are pictured in what appears to be various states of panic.At the southern end is the Fontana del Moro, depicting in the centre a man fighting a fish and surrounding him are four statues blowing a pair of horns each and of course spouting water and surrounded by aquatic life.The \"piece de resistance\" is the magnificent church Saint Agnese in Agone, the entrance being near the centre fountain. Please check out the photos!Apart from the attractions, the are a plethora of restaurants all mostly full and it is difficult to find an empty table. between many of the restaurants are doorways which lead to shops behind. I would recommend you check out prices for goods in less-frequented places before buying here!"

Piazza Navona, born as a place of spectacle and still today a spectacular open air show; an architectural miracle in the heart of the Eternal City, filled with masterpieces in perfect harmony with each other.This piazza, which displays the genius of Bernini and Borromini, is one of the finest Baroque Masterpiece in papal Rome. Its harmony and colors, combined with its elegance, give it a charm that is enhanced by the surprising contrast of architecturally sober houses alternating with a number of monumental Buildings."

It is a large plaza, with fountains and restaurants/shops framing the center, which is a gathering place for artists and musicians. We had our caricatures drawn by a nice young artist (still hangs on our memory wall at home) and enjoyed a wonderfully authentic Italian meal at one of the eight or nine restaurants surrounding the plaza. Of course, this year on our return to Rome for our anniversary, we had to come back to the Piazza and enjoy another memorable experience of sights, sounds, people watching and tremendous food. The cab from our hotel was only about 10-15 Euros. I am not sure about public transportation to the Piazza. You must go to this beautiful little plaza and enjoy the warm and friendly people I am sure you will meet."

But it always seems to possess a sense of peace and relative quiet, despite the persistent vendors shilling their toys, laser lights, etc. With a never-ending list of things to see in Rome, Piazza Navona will always remain near the top on my list."

The piazza is the site of the old stadium of Domitian and still keeps the shape.I love it very early in the morning when few people are around,but if you like a festive feel with lots of people then the evening is for you.Fascinating architecture (read up before as there is plenty of history).Restaurants over priced and there are better in the streets around the piazza but the Tartuffo (chocolate gelato ) at Tre Scalini is famous (from 1946 they trumpet) and really is one of those tourist must-haves although there are better gelatos at a number of places in Rome.The Fountain of the Four Rivers dominates the piazza and (with the Trevi Fountain) is a must-see in Rome."

The restaurants in the plaza are touristic a kind of expensive but if you go to the streets on the side you can find better restaurants and not expensive. We have dinner in one called Mama's Roma. The tour guide recommended this restaurant and it was good for 70% of the prices in the Plaza. The only con is that there is no metro subway close to it so we had to take the bus and walk 3 or 3 streets. It was not a big deal the walking."

Unfortunately it has lost a lot of its charm. Simply put, it has been overrun with hawkers. I enjoy the artists selling paintings and don't mind the caricature drawing booths, even if it is kitschy. But there is nothing charming or redeeming about roving bands of guys tossing glowing plastic helicopters in the sky and getting in your face every five minutes. Thanks, but no. I'm afraid I didn't come to Rome to buy glowing toys made in China.It's still a beautiful place and the fountains are worth a stop on your trip to Rome. But it's not what it once was - which is a reflection of Roman authorities' apathy. Hardly a place where you and your sweetheart can stroll and enjoy the fountains... RIP Piazza Navona!Also, although this probably goes without saying, avoid the tourist trap restaurants that line the Piazza at all costs. Despite the aggressive invitations of the waiters and waitresses, the food (and prices) will disappoint."

The highlight was interestingly the Spray Paint Guy who's name I don't know. He paints the most incredible painting using only spray paint and bits of cardboard. For only 10 euros you can take home a great painting that you watched him create before your eyes. He's amazing. The atmosphere in the piazza is always fun as there are always street performers adding colour to your visit. A must see on your itinerary in Rome!"

I'm not sure I would eat at any of the restaurants, but they're a great place to sit and enjoy a nice glass of wine and watch the world go by (along with all your worries and cares). The fountains are beautiful to see and there are often artists at work or selling their work. Piazza Navona is a one-of-a-kind place that should be visited, especially during the evening hours."

Previously, there was antique emperor Domitian stadium.The main decoration of Piazza Navona - 3 stunning fountains of the great Bernini. In the center - a fountain \"Four Rivers\" (the Nile, the Ganges, La Plata and Danube). It symbolizes the four continents: Europe, Asia, Africa and America.If the architecture is music in stone, the Piazza Navona for me is the music of Verdi.Around the Piazza there are cafes, restaurants, pizzerias. But remember the main rule: the further attraction- the cheaper and tastier food."

Not a negative just a point of clarification. We didn't need restaurants as Rome has a mass of them. We never ate on the piazza itself as these tended to be 10-20% higher in cost - instead walk away from the piazza in any direction and there are some fantastic street restaurants and bars all oozing with ambiance and character. The hotel and staff are great, couldn't help enough and gave some good recommendations. To make yourself feel a little special go for room 14 with the only balcony overlooking the square. Great atmosphere at night. Would I use this hotel again - yes without doubt."

We ended up here after a lovely tour seeing some little known churches to see the 4 fevers fountain by Bernini. It's an elliptical piazza (because it used to be a racing course) with three amazing fountains with the center being the famous four rivers fountain. The building by his rival dominates the architecture. Beautiful. Late evening is a great time to come. People watch. Listen to the music of the street performs, have a gelato or dinner at any of a number of street cafes. We ate at Tre Scalino- excellent!!!!! Wander off on the side streets and enter free, but gorgeous, churches. This is a place to understand \"Bel far niente\". Relax. Enjoy. You are in Rome. Evening is best I think because less hot and more people watching."

It is said that this square used to be filled with water, and naval battles won by the Romans would be re-enacted - hence, Piazza Navona. Amazing! And what about the dismay, trepidation - and rivalry - expressed in the raised arms of one of the figures in Bernini's fountain, before the newfangled cupola of Borromini's church?There's so much to see and do; but before you leave this beautiful Square, take an (expensive, but well worthwhile) open air seat at the cafe' and enjoy a 'mela stregata'. There is usually no limit to the amount of ice-cream I can consume, but this bewitched little number was so rich and delicious, it nearly had me beaten."

The last thing is there's plenty of food options here, so after a long day of sight seeing, you can relax and enjoy a nice wine or something to eat.

There were street performers, artists doing caricatures, people selling jewelry and selfie sticks, food vendors and lots of places around the edge of the Piazza to eat and drink.We only spent a short while here but got some beautiful photos and our tour guide told us a little bit about the history of the area and the fountains."

After we sat down at Tucci's (the southern most restaurant), an accordion player came by. While we were in btw courses, the kids wandered over to watch a magician. Then as my husband and I were finishing our drinks, they boys watched a fire eater/juggler. After dinner, we got some gelato and weaved through the artist on the north side of the fountain.

I would recommend visiting at night too. The second time I visited (this past May) I noticed how expensive everything was. Beware tourist eating traps here. I paid 4\u20ac for a bottle of water where we ate. Do not make my mistake. Maybe enjoy gelato here, but if you want to keep it relatively inexpensive, get away from the piazza to eat a meal. Sit at a fountain and soak in the fact that you are in Rome!"

Piazza Navona is well-known, but not nearly as crowded as some areas. There are three really cool fountains there, and in some ways this is a better fountain option than Trevi because it's not as crowded. The fountain sculptures are fantastic, and the surrounding architecture is really impressive. Plan to enjoy a meal at one ot the restaurants here and take it all in."

It's quite exciting to enter it because almost all the side streets leading into it are narrow---and suddenly there's this big, long, open space! Touristy and overpriced restaurants flank both long sides, and I found that, even though the square is a large space, it was too crowded with tourists, large tour groups with guides, street performers, truck vendors, people coming up to you trying to sell you stuff, etc. Also, I heard you have to be on guard for pickpockets.On one side, there's an imposing Baroque church by Borromini. In the centre of the square is Bernini's popular Fountain of the Four Rivers, with one of Bernini's Rivers looking up in \"horror\" at Borromini's church! I actually liked the two smaller fountains at either short end because at least you could get away from some of the crowds taking \"selfies\"!This piazza is probably much nicer to be in in the early morning, and I'll bet it's pretty at night."

It was on our list of things to see but we hadn\u2019t quite planned to see it so early on into our trip! The piazza is apparently built on the site of the Stadium of Domitian. It was used to host games which were watched by the ancient Romans.In the centre of the piazza there is a very famous fountain known as the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi or Fountain of the Four Rivers. There are two other fountains which are either side of this fountation \u2013 there is the Fontana del Moro and the Fountain of Neptune. Both have been added at different times and had sculptures added to them over time by different artists.There is no denying that when you walk into the piazza that it is incredibly grand on a huge scale. The architecture of the buildings really creates a dramatic backdrop. There are bars and restaurants which are around the outside of the piazza so a perfect place to stop and have a bite to eat as the view is amazing. The only thing which was a little annoying although it didn\u2019t ruin the view was the men trying to sell cheap tat but then they are everywhere! It is definitely worth a visit and walk around even if you just stop by and eat your gelato on one of the many benches lining the piazza. It is a worthy place for a pit stop break!"

There are fables it was once used my military tacticians and it was filled with water to play naval strategy games, but who knows, anything is possible in the Eternal city. Anyway having three Bernini fountains and a beautiful surrounding is more than enough to tempt you to visit. Especially after the Angels and Demons scene in the middle fountain. Has recently been cleaned.One word of note is that prior to sitting down and ordering anything from a coffee to a meal, think twice, as this is high end pricing. Be aware! However every now and again it is worth it and I have done it knowingly on the basis that I love to sit there and watch the great world of Rome go by. But only being conscience at what I would pay.Artists heaven here. Lots of Artisans and artists sitting out and trying to sell their beautiful paintings. It is like a beautiful open air art gallery. Also if you want some fun and a caricature, then this is the place to be. Just haggle!!And of course it is really near the Trevi fountain and Via della Pace (brilliant bars and some nice places to eat). One of choice is Bar del Fico and Ristorante del Fico. Or go further and visit Da Francesco or for me better again Il Corallo - great people and even better food. Try the Gorgonzola pasta!!! On the street Via del corallo.Also as a last note, the Brazilian Embassy is there! Lucky Brazialians. The main church here is Saint Agnes in Agony (go inside its breathtaking and ask to see her skull, it will make you weep). Worth it!"

The large and lively square The main attraction of the Piazza Navona are the three fountains. The central and largest fountain is the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (fountain of the four rivers). It was constructed between 1647 and 1651 on request of the Pope Innocent X. The Fontana del Nettuno, also known as the Calderari, was built in 1576 by Giacomo della Porta. Giacomo della Porta also built the Fontana del Moro. The central statue of a Moor holding a dolphin, a design by Bernini, was added in the 17th century. The tritons are 19th century additions.I recommend to visit the site in the late afternoon and stay there for an outdoor diner in one of the many restaurants around."

Love this square, with the beautiful fountains, especially the fontana dei quattro fiuri (fountain of the four rivers; more on this in a minute!), the street sellers, cafes, buildings, especially the Chiesa di S. Agnese in Agone just behind the 4 rivers fountain. The Square features in many movies, so was great to finally experience it first hand. The cafes are on the expensive side compared to others in Rome, but then again when in Rome and all that it\u2019s great to just sit there with a coffee or beer and people watch. A couple of things to note. First the true history behind the Square is clearly visible if you visit the underground exhibition and excavations that are at the more rounded end of the Square. The Piazza was built on the site of the Stadium of Dominion, built in 1st century AD and exactly matches the open space of that stadium. Ancient Romans went there to watch the games or \u201cagones\u201d. It is believed that over time the name changed to in avone, to navone to navona. Second, this is a must see for fans of Dan Brown\u2019s Angels & Demons, which is centred around the four primal elements Earth, Air, Fire and Water and the murders of 4 cardinals, the preferred candidates to become the next pope, the \u2018preferiti\u2019. Here the 4th cardinal (Spoiler alert! ) is dumped into the Fontana dei Quattro Fiuri bound to weights in order to drown him (WATER). The cardinal is saved and goes on to become pope in the story. Of course, other than this being pure fiction the fountain is not as deep as depicted in the movie! The fountain, which was designed by Bernini for Pope Innocent X, is a basin from which travertine rocks rise supporting four river gods, with an Egyptian obelisk rising above them. The four river gods represent the four major rivers of the four continents through which papal authority had spread at that time: the Danube representing Europe, the Nile Africa, the Ganges Asia and the Rio de la Plata the Americas"

It has come as sort of relaxation, seating in one of the numerous cafes in the Square and observing the wondrous fountains lined along the Piazza.The Piazza Navona was built in 1st century AD and was intended in the beginning of its existence to serve as the open stadium or space for different games, that is, the \"agones\", which had been watched by ancient Romans. Over the times the name of the \"agones\" changed to in avone and finally in navone.We were in front of the most known fountain, i.e. the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi( Fountain of the Four Rivers). It is consisted of the base basin with the rocks that emerge from the water and support the four river gods and above them all this mighty sculptural creation is surmounted by the Egyptian obelisk. The river gods represent the major world rivers, that are, in Europe the Danube, in Africa the Nile, then in Asia the Ganges and in Americas the Rio de la Plata.Since it was very warm that day as in the rest of our sojourn in Rome as well, we have been rather lucky to have the pulverized water tiny droplets above our heads while we were sitting and drinking our cold beverage. The two other remarkable fountains in the Piazza are the Fontana del Moro again with basin and four Tritons and afterwards added the statue of the Moor or African wrestling with a dolphin and second one is the Fountain of Neptune. Always crowded and with many places to eat, drink and shop, naturally highly artistic sight, that Piazza is absolutely not to be omitted when in Rome.One of my favourite Piazzas in the eternal city."

We found it on the way to the Pantheon, but it had such a great fountain and lovely architecture we decided to wander around for a while. We came across some quaint shops and restaurants, but what was the draw for me were the musicians and artists in the square. I'm a sucker for picking up art as a souvenir, and there were several artists all throughout the piazza. It's like going to a free art museum! We ate at one of the restaurants near the fountain, sat outside and watched one of the artists paint nearby. To me, Piazza Navona was the quintessential Italian experience, and I'd highly recommend taking some time to visit."

We loved the Fountain of the Four Rivers of course, it is the central point of the Piazza.

During the day, you can wander around the artists selling their wares, look into the fantastic little shops, enjoy a drink at one of the many restaurants and watch the world go by. At night, it becomes a beautiful square, the fountains light up and the restaurants become al fresco eateries. Even out of season they are all well equipped with canvas drops and patio heaters. You must visit both in the day and at night to appreciate everything this place has to offer. It's a popular place among the tourists and the prices locally in the restaurants etc reflect this. You must take time to appreciate the fountains here. They are beautiful in the daytime and nighttime and you may recognise one from the film Angels and Demons, where a priest took a dip and was saved by Tom Hanks."

Rectangular shaped, this grand piazza is open and surrounded by cafes and beautiful buildings. It is a magnet for people and a natural gathering place. We enjoyed strolling around this square, removed from noise of street traffic. No one seemed to be in a rush. Sitting at a cafe, this was a perfect place to have a coffee and catch our breath after a bit of walking.

One of Rome's most famous squares, this piazza is formerly an ancient Roman chariot track, AKA the race track back in the days. Today, it is one of Rome's most iconic and beautiful piazzas especially at night.Pick your favorite Piazza Navona fountains! Is it one of the Giacomo della Porta's two fountains, the Moorish Neptune in the south or the Roman Neptune in the north? To me, my favorite is the grandest of the three: Bernini's Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of Four Rivers), a beautiful masterpiece recently featured as a main plot piece in Dan Brown's \"Angels and Demons\"! Under the shade of the Egyptian obelisk, Bernini masterfully sculptured a backdrop for four male gods representing the four major rivers of the papal domain, each with vivid emotions and actions depicting their characteristics like the Nile hiding its head as its source was unknown at that time. The piazza is also surrounded by popular gelateria like Grom and restaurants, but you don't need to dine here to enjoy this classic Roman piazza. Simply stroll here day or night and feel the jovial atmosphere! Since it's located essentially in the center of Rome's historic center, it's hard to miss and really, why would you? I definitely recommend swinging by to see the beautiful Piazza Navona and its beautiful fountains.---tl;dr version:1) Formerly an ancient Roman racetrack, now a beautiful piazza with 3 fountains2) Surrounded by popular gelataria and restaurant3) Center of the historic center - Worthy of checking out!"

We sat at one of the cafes and had coffee and dessert while watching the crowds flow by. To be sure, it was crowded! It was also packed with cafes and places to shop, on the Piazza and around each corner. It isn't a place I would say you have to see in Rome, but if you have the time, I'd recommend a visit."

The fountains are nice, but we had just seen Trevi Fountain, so it really paled in comparison. If you go, you can probably see everything you need in about 20 minutes and move on with your day.

You only need a half hour or so to fit the Piazza Navona into your Rome visit though a sit down to people watch can occupy much longer... Despite the horrible, tourist tat-selling shops on some of its approach roads, the street vendors selling all sorts of things you don't need and the sometimes huge numbers of people visiting it, Piazza Navona still retains it's elegance and charm. The tall buildings crowding around its periphery emphasise it's elongated shape and remind you of its original purpose as a race track,and the two fountains provide a focus for a wander around it whilst you decide whether you want a meal in one of the many restaurants or just an ice cream - the one only slightly more affordable than the other! It is particularly beautiful in the evening, just as the light is beginning to disappear (as do most of the visitors) when you can feel that sense of belonging that Rome seems to generate. I love it."

If you like ornate fountains there are three to choose from. Whilst the centrepiece is the largest my favourite is the Fontana del Nettuno which sits at the northern end. There are plenty of cafes to choose from if you want to soak in the atmosphere but they are more expensive than those just off the square. I like the simple beauty of the church facade of Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore over the oppulence of Sant Agnese in Agone. Take this square in if you have the chance and see which if the features you prefer."

Beneath Piazza Navona lie the remains of the 1st century AD 'Stadio di Domiziano', over which the Piazza was laid in the 15th century. This 30,000-seat stadium, whose subterranean ruins can be seen in a museum outside of the north end of the Piazza (Via di Tor Sanguigna) is well worth visiting to understand how this Piazza evolved from the historic arena. It's easy to overlook but it's not expensive and I thoroughly enjoyed the historical experience."

However, be warned prices after 12 midday skyrocket everywhere around the Piazza. eg in the morning a very nice cappucino and croissant was 4 eu each, good value, after 12 o'clock iced coffee is 9 eu each as is the beer. The Piazza is a lovelly oblong surrounded by churches, cafes shops and houses worth a visit just remember the cafes will charge a lot and this is one of the few places around the city where you can sit down on benches rather than having to sit in a cafe."

The waiters are very keen to get you in to sit at a table but if you want a second drink you'll have to ask for it, don't expect the wait staff to be very attentive once they've got you in.

We didn't eat on the square - many people had warned that you get charged for the table location and we didn't even look at prices to be honest. This was great for a wander through at any time of the day or night, the fountains and architecture are amazing.Tip, if you fancy an ice cream, Frigidarium on Via del Governo Vecchio just off the bottom corner of the square is amazing and constantly has a queue a mile long but they get through the queue super-fast. If you fancy something a little more substantial, just where the Piazza Pasquino off the bottom of the square meets Via del Governo Vecchio there is Cafeteria Pasquino (not the Pizzeria Pasquino which is in the square, the Cafeteria Pasquino tucked behind it actually in the entrance to Via del Governo Vecchio). Their happy hour lasts about 3hrs, you get all the acts passing through as they come off Piazza Navona so you get the same atmosphere and it's a fraction of the price - and the food is pretty good as well!!"

However, the attitude of some of the African hawkers are very aggressive - placing 'free' carvings in our kids hands and then asking for money, in a very intimidating manner (I am a big bloke by the way) by invading your space and staring from about 3 inches away was not nice. We refused and simply put the 'freebies' on the floor, but we saw the same guy doing the same thing to a family the next day and he was getting money. All I'd say is do not engage with the African guys, unless you have a penchant for carved tortoises :-)"

Despite being a very popular place with many visitors it didn't seem overly crowded because it is a very big space. There are varied things to see, including some quite bizarre street theatre, and plenty of attractive-looking restaurants but I was advised it's better not to eat here as they are pricey. My friend took me to see many places in Rome, and this was definitely one of my favourites.Just as an aside, I've tried to review one or two lesser-known churches, including Luigi Francesi, which has a wonderful Caravaggio painting in it, and beautiful gilding and marble throughout, but I can't find it as an attraction on TripAdvisor. These places are worth a look with their wonderful artwork and architecture, and they are quiet and cool, which I have very much appreciated after the heat and bustle of Rome."

First, it is a very large open space, ringed with restaurants, shops, and cafes, filled with street performers, street vendors, and tourists. The central fountain is one of Rome's most beautiful, and there are side fountains as well. It is a short walk from the Pantheon, and not far from the Campo di Fiori market, on the 'walking trail' that strings together some of Rome's most important sites. It's not far either from the bridges over the Tiber into the Trastevere. Definitely a 'core sight' and very worth seeing. It's also a great place to sit awhile and watch the show."

The review title is a bit of an overstatement, but whether it is daylight or after dark Piazza Navona captures the essence of this diverse and wonderful city. It is an active urban environment full of people. A wonderful fountain provides a focal point for the space.There are shops and street vendors, restaurants with piazza seating, informal entertainment and art shows. You can walk and explore or sit and watch the parade go by. It's a relatively large space, yet it can feel very intimate, especially in the evening. And if you feel like you've seen enough of the Piazza, there is so much more to explore on the surrounding side streets. There is obviously so much to be explored and appreciated in Rome. For us Piazza Navona, is the perfect initiation to that exploration."

From the apartments and hotels that surround it, to the Sant'Agnese in Agone church, to the fountains, Piazza Navona is a treat to the eye. It is lined with numerous restaurants which all prove to be mediocre and slightly over-priced, but it may just be worth it to sit and watch life go by in the piazza as you enjoy a glass of wine. The piazza is beautiful by day, but cannot be beat at night. The fountains and church are lit, the street performers come out, and everyone just casually strolls around as if they have nowhere to get to...ever. Come out at night to see the Michael Jackson impersonator and fire twirler. Sit on one of many benches and just relax. This is the perfect place to just sit and watch people. Definitely bring gelato. I will say that Piazza Navona has become a tourist trap. As I stated, the restaurants are not the best you'll find in the neighborhood and essentially charge for the view. Venture two blocks in any direction to find superior dining establishments. There are also street vendors everywhere trying to sell art prints, toys, souvenirs, and anything else. If you let them bother you, you won't enjoy Piazza Navona as much. But, in reality, they aren't a bother. They aren't overly persistent and tend to concede with a mere \"No, grazie.\" Some of them even add an additional hint of charm to the already charming piazza. This is without a doubt a can't miss destination while in Rome."

If you read the property description, everything is right\u2026 There are restaurant all over the city and of course, the owner is providing a list of the best places, restaurants and what not to mist while you are in town which is a very nice touch. There is a grocery store at one minute away and all kind of stores where you can buy food if you want. The pictures you see on the web site is was you can expect to see when you are there. After a long day walking around the city, you may not feel like sitting at a restaurant table where you pay you beer 6 euro\u2026. You can sit on the sofa of the apartment with your shoes off, drink the beer you paid 1 euro at the corner store and enjoy the view, after all you live right on the Piazza Navona. Once you close the patio door, this place is very quiet so you can have a good night sleep in the comfortable bed. Mickfer"

Basically piazza is built on top of it. The three fountains honestly are flawless. We had dinner there at night. I wish the fountains were lit up more even use solar lights something to showcase the gorgeousness that is the Neptune statue. Also please make all the people selling the flying crap go away.

Being constantly approached by hawkers of all kinds of trinkets whether we were walking on seated on the edge seating of the cafes trying to eat dinner. We actually moved from an edge table to an interior (still out doors) table to get away from them.I know Italy and all of Europe have taken in many foreign refugees.

Later, when we did a guided tour of the city we found out that this square is actually the most expensive area in town and the guide also told us that the food is not even that great there.Although I would not advise this place for a drink, you should definitely go there during your stay in Rome. There are several artists on the square, there was a clown performing a few acts and we even heard an opera singer. In conclusion, go there for a walk, but go somewhere else for food or a drink if you don't want to pay too much."

Then take a close look at the fountain and the church. The church was built by Borromini, the rival of Bernini who was later asked to build the fountain in front of the church. To express their rivalry, Bernini decided to make two of the figures on the fountain face the church. One of them covers his face, the other one raises his hands to protect himself from the church, like it will fall down on him."

What I did not like is a big number of beggars on this plaza that are so persistant, even if you do give them couple of coins, they still insist on more.

We walked through with a tour guide, which was great -- if your budget allows. She was able to point out the interesting features of the fountains. They have a lot going on and it made the experience more meaningful.I highly recommend that area for dinner. Away from the piazza is a maze of narrow cobblestone streets with bars and restaurants. A lively place to go for a drink and then dinner. There were people everywhere, so make sure you have a reservation."

Currently it appears to be very trendy, upscale, expensive and a happening place. The piazza has three fountains, Around the edges of this piazza, one can find cafes with outdoor seating. Tourists and locals seem to flock to the area. I am glad I walked there to see this piazza, but it was not some place I wanted to linger at or return to."

The surrounding shops, venders, performers, sights and resturants that make this a Roman experience that you will always have to call on when you remember your holiday. Something is always going on at the Piazza. I have been there on two previous occasions and the Piazza is something to experience. It's been a different each visit. Just go there you will find your nitch. Big enough not to feel confined I'm sure you'll love it."

In its center You find Bernini's Fountain of Four Rivers, one of the great master's masterpieces. The Piazza is thought to have started as a stadium, but later became a marketplace until the mid 19th century. At one end, you find the Fontana del Moro, and at the other, the Fontana di Neptuno. The church of St. Agnes is on one side of the piazza, with masterieces by Rainaldi and Borromini as well as one of the palaces of the Pamphilj family. Today, the Piazza is a place where itinerant artists exhibit their work, street entertainers perform, people of all sorts walk, sit and enjoy the sunshine. There are several restaurants, coffee shops and gelaterias and this is Rome at its best for people watching. Be prepared to pay more for everything, since your fellow tourists compete for everything."

Roma is magnificient (in every possible way) and it may be too much -especially if it is your first time.

The Fountain of the Four Rivers, in the center, is a masterpiece, but also take some time to admire the other two, smaller fountains at the end.

We were a bit spoilt as our hotel accommodation was just a street away and we walked either through or passed this square virtually everyday and were amazed at just how many tourists visited each day. But I guess at a price, the square is surrounded by overpriced and pushy restaurants and if you do happened to eat there you are constantly pestered by Indians or Africans trying to sell you rubbish. In our week in Rome this was the only attraction that seemed to have an excessive amount of rubbish lying around. A pity as the fountains are well worth a visit and the restaurants a few block away are all good value."

If this was sitauted in another city it would be one of the highlights of the city probably, but compared to the rest of Rome it just gets an average from me. There is a lot of people here during the day and evening which does give it a good atmosphere, there are street performers and artist and plenty of tourist. The square is surrounded by bars and cafes, which we found all offer pretty much the same menu. Some of the PR people can get a bit annoying, but its a great place to people watch. The prices are dearer than some of the side street restaurants eg 1ltr draught beer \u20ac14, coffee \u20ac6 there was then an additional 14% tax and a note saying service charge not included."

We came by one evening to soak up the atmosphere and saw people relaxing by the fountains, entering the church along the piazza and enjoying the performances by street buskers. We then had dinner at an Enoteca nearby called Cul De Sac. Absolutely amazing food and the bill for 3 persons (we ate a lot! and had 2 glasses of wine) was 52 euros, What a steal!"

We thought this was a great location, restaurants were good and comparable in tourist pricing. Plus it was on the way to Campo de' Fiori, a great flower and veggie market (many tourists) where the people were fun and the produce was excellent, if you want to pick your own baby zucchini with blossoms, for example."

Piazza Navona is one of my favourite places to sit and watch everything going on plus meeting others from different countries especially drinking an Aperols Spritzer my favourite Italian drink. Again will return next year for another visit as it is an experience I love and throwing a coin in the Trevi Fountain means you will return."

He was the first Sculptor to successfully `Capture a Feeling` in stone, and the Creator of what is known as The Baroque Style. What pleasure one gains from sitting there among such wonders enjoying a meal and a glass of wine. Restaurant Prices are understandably slightly higher considering where you are.

Wonderful fountains of Piazza Navona and shade available at almost all time on either side of the square give a nice oasis to rest on long Roman tours. The piazza is lined with restaurants, but an ice-cream that costs 2 EUR, quickly becomes 10 if you sit down. Cute toy store on the corner, those with boys might want to enter, great Roman sword replicas are available."

Lots and of touts selling selfie-stick and single stem roses, but that is true of everywhere in Rome. Lots of restaurants and bars, but are pricey and the food quite average, you get much better food and deals on quality food and drink at more reasonable prices at some of the small alleys behind and to the side of the piazza, try Bibamus on Via di S. Maria Dell Anima which runs parallel to the piazza, good standard food and relatively cheap beer but its small. Navona is lovely and definitely worth a visit for the fountains and just 'to be there' lots of people walking about just being happy. One of the 'must see' sights of Rome"

            "review": "Four Winds, Angels and Demons and fab gelato. If you've seen 'Angels and Demons' you will recognise the Piazza Navona as the place where the hero rescues a kidnapped cardinal from the fountain of the four winds, an immense sculptural creation by Bernini in the centre of the piazza.The Piazza was reasonably quiet the first time we visited, and we happily nattered about the film, watched some very stylish dancers making the most of a busking quartet and treated ourselves to ice creams in a variety of enticing flavours.For some reason, although it was nowhere near our hotel, we kept finding ourselves at Piazza Navona, and experienced it at night (lots of hawkers with scarves, wooden chopping boards which transform into fruit bowls and carved animals) and again during the day when artists offer prints (100 x the price you will pay on the river bank near the Castel St Angelo) and caricatures.We had a bit of last-evening fun bartering for a couple of scarves, but otherwise weren't bothered by the hawkers who seemed to aim for the more obvious tourists.Now I\u2019m going to say a few words about being a tourist in Rome, and I will include it with reviews of all the places we visited because I wish I had known prior to my visit and maybe it will help you on yours!Firstly, Rome is an elegant city. Tourists in shorts, crop-tops and mini-skirts stand out like a very sore thumb. This attire will mean you are unwelcome in churches, (especially the Vatican and the Vatican Museums) where it is regarded as disrespectful. Expect to be turned away if you are dressed like this. We witnessed from one lady in microshorts and a strappy top and her partner in vest top, Bermudas and tattoos, being politely asked to cover up or leave St Peter\u2019s which did not go down well after waiting for hours in a queue.If you dress smartly you are less likely to be bothered by hawkers, tables materialise in apparently packed restaurants, and you are treated with respect. It\u2019s worth going for \u2018smart casual\u2019 if you want to get the best from Rome.Secondly, footwear. Roman streets are mainly cobbled and very gappy. Stiletto or kitten heels are going to be mighty uncomfortable. Wear block heels, wedges or flat shoes and you won\u2019t go far wrong. Most Roman ladies seem to run around in loafers or boots. Another thing to consider is that there is A LOT of walking involved wherever you go. Walk your shoes in thoroughly before you get there and you will save yourself a lot of pain and blisters. Nevertheless, it might be a good idea to pack some plasters in your handbag so you don\u2019t limp yourself out of action. I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019m the first person to lose a toenail after three days walking around the city.Be polite, smile, say hello, please and thank you in Italian and you will be appreciated as much as you appreciate the Eternal City."

It's a beautiful Piazza - full of history. Piazza Navona is famous for the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers). It's topped by the Obelisk of Domitian, brought in pieces from the Circus of Maxentius. Piazza Navona has two other fountains. at the southern end is the Fontana del Moro and at the northern end is the Fountain of Neptune. You should take some time, sit and enjoy a gelato, and people watch. There are street artists and street vendors that liven things up. There are countless restaurants with outside tables for people-watching. My ONLY complaint/suggestion is : be wary of some of the street vendors - I watched one practically terrorize a tourist when they had expressed interest in a purse (counterfeit to be sure). When the tourist said \"never mind\" I watched this vendor dog them for about 15 minutes - pressure selling if I ever saw it. The secret is to be distant and uninterested and you'll be fine. Check out the carousel if you have kids - it was fun to watch."

The fountains are beautiful but as a few other reviewers have commented I had expected more.

You can sit on one of the benches by the fountains and just enjoy the sound of the fountains and watch people walking around, taking pictures, and watch vendors set up their little spot to sell their products. If you want to buy a painting or an artwork, and if you happen to include Venice as one of your itineraries in Italy, I highly recommend buying your artwork souvenir in Venice because it's more expensive in Rome or in Florence. I happen to wait til my last day in Italy and I happen to be in Rome. I bought an artwork in Piazza Navona, which cost me \u20ac25.00, which only costs \u20ac10.00 in Venice and the quality is better. Anyways, I highly recommend going to Piazza Navona. It was also close to Pantheon. It was a decent walking distance so you can plan to group those two sites on the same day. If you happen to need a bathroom, go in the restaurant just across the fountain. They don't charge bathroom use, unlike other public bathrooms in Italy."

During the day it is full of artists and characturists. The bigger water feature has a needle monument, but the detail on the sculptures attached to it are amazing. There are some stone benches dotted around so there are places to sit and chill if you've walked around all day like I did."

It was built over the 1st-century Stadio di Domiziano, it was paved over in the 15th century and for almost 300 years hosted the city's main market. I've seen here beautiful fountains, baroque palazzi and colourful cast of street artists, hawkers and tourists. Its centrepiece is Bernini\u2019s Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, an ornate, showy fountain featuring personifications of the rivers Nile, Ganges, Danube and Plate. The Fontana del Moro at the southern end of the square was designed by Giacomo della Porta in 1576. At the northern end of the piazza, is Fontana del Nettuno where Neptune is fighting with a sea monster, surrounded by sea nymphs. It's nice to stay near a fountain an simply look at the people, have a coffe os buy souvenirs. And, of course, take many photos! :)"

We visited Rome for 1 week in April 2016, and one thing I experienced is that it seems like for every 10 tourists there must have been 1 robber or thief lurking around every tourists spot. Whether it is the Trevi fountain, piazza Navona, the Pantheon or the Colosseum you really have to watch out for these people. These thieves and robbers are really good and they place themselves among the crowd and most often looking like tourists themselves. I really prepared myself before I went on this trip and doing all the precautions I can think of, but one moment I let go of my guard and my backpack was gone with my camera and some souvenirs. Don't get me wrong. Rome is a nice place to visit but one thing I hate are people who take advantage of people, especially tourists that gives their economy a boost. Imagine all the income tourism brings to Rome. Rome is a great city with an amazing history what makes it not so great are the thieves and robbers that gives a bad name to this marvelous city."

It changes every hour and which eve hour you are here you will enjoy this fabulous location. There is the fountain, the restaurants (go into the back streets for best value), the buskers, museums and all the canvassers trying to sell you stuff. So much to explore from this location.

Buy yourself a gelato while entering the square and wander for at least 30/45 minutes to have the time to explore, see the paintings of the artists, enjoy the white marble/travertino lime stone and then keep on towards the next beauty of the eternal city!"

It's surrounded by many overpriced restaurants, touristy shops and dominated by the Sant'Agnese in Agone church. The church itself is worth a visit and the piazza is filled with both tourists and locals enjoying the day. There are often performers and artists to entertain you if the people watching is not enough. Check out Tre Scalini's famed Tartufo... a chocolate truffle ice cream concoction!"

My family and I visited on a Thursday morning. We were 3 days into our visit to Rome at that point, and had already visited many stunning piazzas. However, I felt that Piazza Navona was a little overstated - there are many squares in Rome equally as beautiful (and in many cases, more so) but much less crowded. In addition, the square was packed with street sellers, con artists and tour groups - at one point we were being offered selfie sticks multiple times per minute, which is extremely bothersome when you are trying to take in the beauty of the square. Overall, I would consider visiting Piazza Navona again, but would much rather spend time somewhere more beautiful and secluded, and less frequented by tourists and street sellers."

I was on a university field trip and my friends and I used to go to Piazza Navona every single day as you get to see the crowds of international visitors like ourselves and it has a wide variety of restaurants to choose from, as well as souvenir stores and small stalls selling paintings. The fountains are very picturesque and by night time, the street performers put on a great show. Very friendly people at Piazza Navona and the locals are always willing to help if you're lost or if you just need to ask a couple of questions about the city."

There are interesting fountains, lots of restaurants, and many folks walking through. We sat down (outside) at one restaurant for a cold drink and bite of food. Wa need to people-watch, but when the waiter learned we didn't want a meal, he put us at a background table against the building instead of up front in their seating area. Many restaurants have waiters calling out to attract you and they can be pushy! Also, we are thinking that the \"service charge\" on our tab might have actually been for the server, who was not very attentive. We did leave a tip but later felt ripped off. The whole place just seemed less charming than we'd expected on either visit. Just walk thru once!"

It was certainly very quiet .I found some great places to eat and drink in Rome all with an abundance of atmosphere normally full of Romans/ Italians and with a much smaller price tag than the Navona."

Each river represents the four continents,Africa,Europe,Asia and Americas.It was designed in 1651.The piazza also contains two other fountains and a church. It is not as small as the piazza in front of the Pantheon, nor as big as Piazza Venezia. One doesn't feel hemmed in nor does one feel disoriented.We have been to Piazza Navona thrice while we have holidayed in Rome.Once we were lucky enough to have visited during the Christmas market, when the piazza was buzzing with commercial activity, with stalls selling Christmas decorations, clowns doing shows and a lovely, vintage carousal,festooned with warm lights, lilting out the sweetest of tunes.Piazza Navona is lovely, whatever the time and should be a compulsory part of your Rome itinerary."

The fountains on either end of the piazza are also worth looking at. The Piazza Navona is surrounded by beautiful buildings. We enjoyed an hour or two sitting in a pavement cafe watching the world go by in these lovely surroundings. Do not come to the piazza for an authentic experience of Italian life. The whole set-up is definitely a tourist trap. So, why the 4 stars? well...we were tourists! For much of our time in Rome, we found little out of the way places to eat and drink and soak up Italian culture, so we enjoyed our moment of blatant tourism!! The \"artists\" in the piazza were mainly selling prints that were mass produced for the tourist market, the coffee and ice cream we bought in the pavement cafe cost the price of a decent lunch, but we did not feel ripped off because it was exactly what we expected and that was okay! Visit Piazza Navona for an indulgent tourist moment and have a coffee in one of the pavement cafes and enjoy the beautiful surroundings."

Our guide Elena gave us a great historical accounting of the fountains and buildings that make up the Piazza. We were here at Christmas time, and the Piazza was filled with street performers trying to make a Euro, vendors (be sure and try some roasted chestnuts if you happen to be in Rome during the Christmas holidays...delicious!), and tourists but amazingly still a great and relatively peaceful experience. If people watching is your thing, you will be in 7th heaven.There are several places to sit throughout the Piazza and enjoy the scenery. I highly recommend a guided walking tour of Rome so that you get all of the historical information while taking it all in. As always, hang onto your belonging as there are some people who would love nothing better than to separate you from t hem forever.Wonderful experience which I hope to replicate some day!"

Truly delicicious. We had a litre of house red wine to go with everything and it was just right! We shared two large pizzas - one with ham, artichokes, and egg, and a second entirely vegetarian. And both were excellent. We finished with espresso and one tea. The entire bill for 3 was 52 euros which round here is great value for money. Service amazing. And the stone steps to the toilets pretty time in the time of the Pantheon which isn't far away. We were delighted when a complimentary liqueur arrived.

Here's great cafes with friendly staff and maybe a bit high prices. It is really beautiful and we have had some great days here."

Walking into the boisterous Piazza Navona with its crowds, hawkers, and restaurants is exciting for any tourist, but it likely pales in comparison with walking into exactly the same space in 86 A.D. Then Roman citizens crowded into the seats that are now outlined in the buildings that line the piazza and watched the inaugural games ordered by Emperor Domitian. The emperor spent so much building this stadium as well as other venues that he nearly broke the treasury. If you go to the far north end of the piazza and walk through the archway you will find visible remains of the stadium. The name of the Piazza Navona is a corruption of the word \"agone\" (Greek for games that were held here). The beautiful church on the east side of the piazza is dedicated to St. Agnes who died here as a martyr after being assaulted in one of the brothel areas that flourished in the stadium arcades. (See Jacobs, \"A Walk Through The Field of Mars\" (Walk Two) ).This is a piazza rich in Roman history even as its modern entertainment delights."

Usually artists are selling their wares (or copies of someone else's) in the square and often musicians are playing, too. Many, many restaurant serve meals in the area but wander through the small side street to find affordable food rather than eat in the piazza."

It is a vast area dominated by Boromini's church and Bernini's sculptures. It is packed with bars, restaurants, street vendors and artists of varying calibre. Yes it is touristy and yes the prices are slightly higer than other places in Rome but it really must be done. It is a great place to just sit in the sun in one of the many bars and contemplate your next food order. We always go to Rocco Bar. The waiters are friendly and the food is good. However, I am sure all the bars are very similar, the tables are all very close together and the premium seats are at the front near the pavement. They always go first so go before noon if you want the best seat. Its just a greeat fun place to spend a few calm hours."

The church facade is unusual because it curves in and out, giving a sense of a living, breathing structure.

They are both by Giacomo della Porta, but improved by Bernini and others.A number of good restaurants and cafes surround the piazza.

Lots going on in the centre of the Piazza with artists, street performers and beautiful fountains. Upmarket restaurants and bars surround the edge of the Piazza and a great place to sit and have a drink whilst you watch the world go by - really few places to equal this anywhere I've been - but be careful the drinks are very pricey and the food more so. A couple of leisurely drinks is a must though but would head off to one of the many side streets for a much more reasonably priced meal. could not imagine visiting Rome again without going back here"

The piazza is bustling and for good reason; the fountain is great, the churches around the area are great and several shops have a bit more than the typical tourist goods. However, much like the rest of Rome, it is in need of a clean up like a fresh coat of paint here and there and a power washing to remove some of the grime. Also, beware of the cafes selling overpriced drinks. I don't eat at places where the staff stand outside trying to hustle you to a table but if you don't mind forking over 7 Euros for a coffee or soda, it's not a bad place to get off your feet and take in some of the city."

The restaurants here are overpriced - you're much better off exploring some of the smaller streets and alleys where absolutely bargains can be found in terms of great food at low prices. The fountain is pretty stunning and great for a photo opportunity. The one thing that really spoils a visit to Piazza Navona is the number of street hawkers/sellers. You can barely walk 2 steps without someone shoving a bunch of 'selfie-sticks' under your nose - even though they must have seen you decline the offers of half a dozen others selling the same things. Just be firm and don't be pressured into buying stuff you don't want or need."

            "review": "Fabulous Navona Square!. This beautiful long and oval square was paved over the site of the Domitian Stadium (86 AD) in the 15th C. and is located in the historic center of Rome. The famous and lively square with many pricey outdoor cafes and restaurants features three magnificent fountains. The central and largest fountain is the famous Fountain of the Four Rivers (the Nile, Ganges, Danube and Rio de la Plata), topped by the Obelisk of Domitian, was created by Bernini in 1651.The Neptune Fountain on the north end was made by Giacomo della Porta in 1576 as was the Moor Fountain on the south end a year earlier.Other prominent Baroque constructions are the Pamphili Palace of Pope Innocent X and the adjacent Church of Sant'Agnese in Angone commissioned by him in 1652. The beautiful church fa\u00e7ade was designed by Borromini in 1653. The ancient \"speaking\" statue of Pasquino on the southwest end was erected in 1501. There used to be a market on the square but it was moved to neighboring Campo de Fiori in 1869."

It's a beautiful plaza full of history. There are restaurants, cafes and gelato stands for all tastes. There are lovely sovieneer shops around the plaza, a favourite of ours being the toy store on the corner near a gelato shop. There are individual artists who sell their work at night, this makes for a great opportunity to have your own piece of Rome to return home with.A fantastic area to visit and also stay in!"

Watch out for pick pockets as always, after all you're in Roma. But do relax, dine, shop around. If it's hot, or raining, just to into St Agnese. Google the history of the 4 dudes sat on the center Fontana dei Fiumi will make your trip even more meaningful to share your selfies with loves ones at home. So what if you're single, well, \"schmingle\" with the locals for God sake, you're in Roma~! Plenty local families, love birds chilax around this piazza day and night. Please do NOT drink the water. Not these 3 fountains....Coffee lovers, check out the coffeewares available in the shops, but do keep in mind, can be extra costly. Hey, never hurt to look and check out the cute cappuccino and espresso cups. They're nice looking and small and light weight to take home on the back pack.

It is one of Rome's liveliest squares, with many outdoor cafes, restaurants and night clubs in the neighborhood. Piazza Navona is one of the Roman's most treasured piazzas; here, in centuries past, acrobats and jugglers performed and even today, it's still lively with painters and street performers that put on their shows for tourists and passersby, new spectators of that life that's always flowed though the piazza with movement and joy."

It's built on the site of the Stadium of Domitian from 1st century AD. The ancient Romans watch the agones (\"games\"), and hence it was known as the competition arena (\"Circus Agonalis\"). Following the form of the open space of the stadium, the Piazza Navona was transformed into high Baroque Roman architecture during the reigned of Pope Innocent X (1644-55AD). Sant'Agnese in is a 17th-century Baroque church that faces the Piazza Navona. This is the site where the Early Christian Saint Agnes was martyred in the ancient Stadium of Domitian. Construction of the church began in 1652AD under the father/son architects Girolamo and and Carlo Rainaldi but later finished by Francesco Borromini. Legend states that the name of the piazza changed over throuigh the years from 'in avone' to 'navone' and eventually to 'navona'."

The restaurants around the outside are good for the view of the square, but not wallet. Walked 30 m afterDinner and found another restaurant serving the same food for 1/2 the price. I would walk through (everything is so close - why skip it!) but don't expect a lot. Note: we were really hoping for a Christmas market, and it seems to have been shut down this year, which is a shame."

The Baroque buildings surrounding the square are just beautiful, and the centerpiece, Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers, is huge and impressive from every angle. You have to feel sorry for the sculptors of the other two, much smaller, fountains in the square -- who even knows their names? Although we saw no market on the day we were there, there were a couple of small and (deliberately?) old-fashioned fairground booths and a carousel, and a few street performers and artists we were quite happy to sit in the sun and watch."

Visit a most beautiful church that looks so unassuming until you get inside. I think it is the church of St. Agnes..it's worth the small donation to enter. Right outside is the famous Bernini fountain that you must walk around and view from all angles. It is exquisite!!. As you walk around the Piazza, that was once an Amphitheater, there will be people playing instruments, painters selling their paintings, etc. I find the beauty of the Piazza Navona in the fact that it is not that big, but a size that makes it very comfortable and enjoyable. Visit at night also when the fountain is lite. It is also in walking distance to the Pantheon."

The plaza, on the former site of a racecourse (hence the long, thin layout) is now distinguished for three splendid fountains. The best is the Four Rivers Fountain by the l7th century's greatest sculptor, Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Use a guidebook (such as the Touring Club Italiano, the Baedeker, or Blue Guide, or Companion Guide to Rome) to tell you which figure means what. Knowledge makes the fountain even more delightful and interesting. Then visit the handsome, imposing church of St. Agnes that faces the fountain. The fountains at the ends of the piazza are fine but less thrilling, so concentrate on the central one. At the CHristmas season, there's a charming market held on the piazza."

Its nearby the Trevi Fountain and Pantheon, making it a great spot to eat lunch after visiting both! There are several street artists, and it's fun to browse their work. There are some nice (although a bit touristy) restaurants with a patio, but its lovely to have a nice coffee or pasta in such beautiful surroundings."

The Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi was built in 1651 by Bernini and represents the four important rivers of the Nile, the Danube, the Ganges and the Rio de la Plata. Stopping at each section of the fountain we are able to distinguish each river. Beautiful artwork. The buildings surrounding the Piazzo also have interesting and unique history. We visited on a Monday evening and the Piazzo was crowed with various street venders, families out for the evening and numerous restaurants, all full with evening diners.

Besides the fountains, there are several Palazzos and two churches in the Piazza Navona along with cafe\u2018s and art and souvenir sellers \u2013 truly a piazza for everybody\u2019s tastes.

Depending on the time you arrive, I would recommend viewing the the three fountains first; the Fountain of the Four Rivers, The Fountain of Neptune, and Moor Fountain. If you're into Catholic artwork and design then proceed to the Sant'Agnese in Agone. Take a stroll around the venue to enjoy some people watching and capture some photos. Then if you need a break, stop off an eatery. Afterwards, at the south end there's a Museo Roma and wrap up the venue with some shopping. Cheers."

Piazza Navona is lined with shops and restaurants. (Beware of the elevated prices.) Furthermore, several impressive structures are situated on Piazza Navone, to name one: The Santa Agnese in Agone church. The central area is the domain of painters and street artists; unforgettable are the three beautiful fountains, whereof Bernini's \"Four Rivers\" is the most famous.

Ancient cobblestones beneath your feet, guiding you along while fine-arts street vendors paint and charcoal some of the most stunning portraits of passer-by for a modest fee. The great Bernini sculptures, fountains and antiquities surround from the balconies to the street. If you do not spend some time here you have missed both the staging point of old Rome and a piece of your own soul."

Like most piazzas, its surrounded by restaurants which seem to cater to tourists. The piazza itself is split in two in terms of who caters to it. One side has the artists who sell paintings or caricatures. I have to say that I was impressed by some of the paintings as they seemed to provide a different sort of view vs the typical \"impressionist\" type paintings. I saw a few picasso-type or cubist-type painters. The other side of the square is where all of the street performers (living statues, etc) reside. Supposedly the artist market started due to the sister-in-law of one of the popes who drove away the original market in the square because it was too loud but then changed the rules again when she found that it was too quiet after the market left."

Also, it's just so picturesque when you cast you eyes from one end to the other end of the piazza. There are restaurants and gelaterias nearby. I had so much fun getting a cone of gelato, planted my bottom by the fountain and ate my ice cream watching all that was going on. There were street performers, artists painting and selling art work, vendors making creative bracelets from wire, etc. It is supposedly like hawker galore in Asia, except this feels more like an art fair.

There are a number of cafes around the edges of the square. We walked here from St. Peter's and then continued on to the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain, and the Spanish Steps.

On the down side is that the piazza itself is filled with trashy stalls selling kitsch, and there are various kinds of street entertainment such as fire dancers. Oh well.

Piazza Navona offers several good to excellent restaurants, an open air market, excellent \"people watching\", 3 fountains that are beautifully detailed and it is an excellent \"rest stop\" while doing a walking tour of the sites. We never miss Piazza Navona on our trips to Rome."

The middle of the square is filled with vendors and street artists but they are not pushy. We did a quick breath-taking tour of Sant'Agnese in Agone (St Agnes church). There is a museum at the south end and I think you can take an underground tour starting at the north end. Otherwise, I suggest taking a load off and just enjoy the atmosphere."

It's a nice place to catch the sun, look at artists displaying their wares and get a caricature of you and your partner made.The surrounding buildings do not seem particularly spectacular and the fountain is attractive but not awe inspiring. The best thing we saw was a toy store on the north side of the plaza near the street outlet.However, if you are looking for a place to eat, there are plenty. If you like a place to stay that is central to the various attractions in Rome, the Piazza Navona area is a great choice as it is very central and has a cab area where it is easy to catch a cab.Fine for what it is, great for a central location, but not really an attraction in its own right."

This is a free attraction and worth a stroll on a nice day. Morning light made for great photos and the plaza was just starting to bustle. There are several artists displaying their oil paintings and water colors, and street performers trying to tempt you out of a few dollars. We popped into Sant'Agnese in Agone Church just in time to catch some of Sunday mass (which was stunning under the ornate interior of the church). There are plenty of restaurants around this area for you to have a coffee or (my favorite) a spritz after checking out the fountains. As with anything in Italy, wear comfortable shoes and bring layers."

It can be a restful place also to people watch as there are cement benches or ledges around the fountain to sit. The location is central and is easy to get to by city bus. It really is a must-see because it is so well-known for its statuary. So, for this reason, it is crowded with tourists.

In fact, I highly recommend just strolling around the city at night. I think we loosely followed Rick Steve's Heart of Rome walking tour our first night there.

The main exhibit was about the end of WWII in Italy. As an American, this was very interesting to me! Mainly photos, many were ones that were censored at the time. Very cool.The regular exhibits were also very interesting - including two \"draft\" pieces of sculpture and the final piece! Never thought of that!!Plus, since this museum was once a private home, there are still 4 original statues which have been there since the time families lived there! Tremendous."

Almost every time I've been to Rome I've sat down and eaten an overpriced meal on this great former Roman \"circus\" - a long ellipse packed with restaurants, artists selling their wares, two Bernini fountains and another in his style for good measure. For some reason on my most recent trip, less than a month ago I resisted the urge to eat or even have an espresso, but even though I strolled at the cost of an elbow (or worse, a selfie-stick - really hate those) from a rude or at least unknowing tourist (usually in a group) trying for that perfect photo, I never regret even a brief visit - I suspect that you won't either."

Bernini's Fountain of 4 rivers with the egyptian obelisk in the centre is a sight to be enjoyed in broad daylight & after sunset too!We went there in the evening & sat staring at the beautiful fountain all lit up in golden lights - it was super busy, with artists painting, performing, singing, shopping & ppl dining in restaurants around the piazza. The other 2 fountains are little less crowded, so you can sit near them & view the central one. We returned next day for lunch- it was totally crowded again & more beautiful in day light!! Enjoyed a good meal looking at the fountain & got a crazy caricature done by an artist in the square- a pleasant memory."

It is built on the site of one of ancient Rome's smaller circuses, so the north end is rounded and the south end squared off. Piazza Navona contains two of Bernini's masterpieces; the church of Sant Agnese in Agone and La Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi. The church is brilliant, but it's the fountain that brings back again and again. The four rivers the sculptor has represented are the Nile (a Nubian whose head is covered with a cloth, because in Bernini's day, its source was unknown); the Ganges with its long oar attesting to its navigability; the Plate (Rio de la Plata) with its silver coins (Plata is Spanish for silver) and the Danube with its Papal coat of arms as its the larest river close to Rome. Fantastic! I've visited this fountain every hour of the day and night and it never fails to fascinate me."

Beyond that there are the three splendid fountains, each worthy of their own review, the large church of Sant' Agone, the splendid Renaissance architecture all around, restaurants and shopping, nightlife and some view into normal Roman life. It also made a great starting point for our walking tour of \"Renaissance Rome\" that included 16 \"must see\" stops between here, Trevi fountain and back to our hotel."

Full of eateries and street performances, it provides a good feel of Rome. The fountains and church are interesting. Children will have a good time here. Just beware of quacks and pick-pocketing."

But then what a surpise! it's great all-round entertainment once you arrive there, from sampling the fresh-roasted chestnuts on sale at the southern approach, to the magnificent Fontana del Quattro Fiumi sculpture surmounted by an Egyptian obelisk that forms its artistic centrepiece, to the cafes and restaurants of varying quality and price dotted around its perimeter. Bear in mind, if you are new to the city, that sitting at a table-with-a-view will always cost you.Everywhere you look there is something to entertain the eyes and ears, from street musicians with kids dancing to their tunes, to an Indian apparently seated suspended in mid-air, to those obligatory living statues of pharaohs, bikers, people with no heads . . . . , to clever artists who will create a splendid caricature of you and yours, and roll it up ready for the flight home, for ten Euros in all of five minutes. Yes it's blatantly, brashly touristy, Roman-style, but who cares if you're having a ball!"

This piazza is definitely worth visiting, and conveniently crosses many of the many routes through to the Vatican, Pantheon etc. It's an ever changing landscape, from lazy coffee drinking in the morning, to afternoon cocktails and then atmospheric outdoor dining and gelato in the evening. All against the backdrop of Bernini's magnificent 'Fontana dei Quattro fiumi' (fountain of the four rivers) and Obelisk of Dimitian - worth the visit alone. This square was a market place for more than 500 years, and today hawkers, artists and more still ply their trade - even if their wares are now selfie sticks, shawls, handbags and glow in the dark toys. But it's all pretty benign. Expect to pay a premium for piazza-side dining, but there are some real restaurant and coffee shop gems literally yards from the main piazza down the many side streets."

My friend and I went back to Piazza Navona several times throughout our trip as it was my favorite place to be in all of Rome; the reason being that in the evening one could be serenaded by Italians singing songs in Italian. One disappointment that I have had in many of my international travels is that while I love to immerse myself in the culture of whichever country I'm visiting, I rarely get the opportunity to hear their native music. It seems almost any country that you visit, you will hear Elvis Presley--whether you are at a restaurant, a bar, just walking down the street, or even while on a Greek ferry and doing some island hopping! :( While I have always loved Elvis Presley, I don't have to leave the States to hear him--I can get that at home! I travel because I want complete cultural immersion. I want to enjoy their music, their food, eat where the locals eat, and not go to tourist traps except to buy souvenirs. Be sure to go to Piazza Navona in the evening. If you go in the daytime, you will scratch your head and wonder what the place has to offer other than its beautiful fountains. It is absolutely dead in the daytime. Nights are a completely different story as the restaurants put almost all of their tables and chairs outside, and you feast on real Italian food while listening to authentic Italian music, and then can wander around just enjoying the fountains or buy souvenirs from the vendors. I bought a lovely Italian scarf that contained illustrations of some of the more popular Roman sites for under 5 euros! Yes, many may consider it a tourist trap as yes tourists gravitate there, at least you can hear the true music of the country while you dine on real Italian food as opposed to what you get in many places, particularly the hotel restaurants: Americanized versions of Italian food! Yuck! They think they are catering to American taste with their special sauces which always turn out to be some form of ketchup sauce :( :( I would love to know where this idea came from LOL--Could it have come from our preponderance of fast-food restaurants? Buon appetito!"

The whole Piazza was full of people..locals having a leisurely time at the parklike setting...tourists taking pictures against the background of the great fountain of four rivers. There were clowns, anime artists or those dressed up knights and ladies of olden times looking for curious tourists to pay for a photo opportunity. It was a lively sight with street dancers breaking dance in the cool pavement. Colored kites and tiny bubbles filled the air from the toys of the toddlers and kids milling in the square.

There are also a range of street artists and market traders during the day and musicians and other entertainers during the evening.Due to it's popularity the piazza does get busy during the tourist season but the sheer volume of restaurants means that you can normally find a table to sit and eat delicious Roman cuisine whilst watching Rome life. As with all tourist areas across the world, you pay a premium for the restaurants close by but because of the competition for business most eateries in Piazza Navona do not charge the normal service charge, so it's not too badly priced overall."

We were recommended to see the Piazza by our hotel, so duly headed over to explore.First point - it may seem big on the map, but as it is surrounded by some rather large buildings, it is very easy to walk straight by if you don't think to nip down the ally to get there.However, once you find it, its a great place to while away some time. The large centrepiece fountain representing the worlds major rivers (partly by Bernini) is simply gorgeous, and there is no shortage of artists and musicians to keep the place vibrant.Lots of good restaurants on the Piazza, but head onto one of the little side streets just off the main area for a meal that's just as good at half the price.Also - if you make it across the piazza without being offered a \"selfie-stick\" for sale at least three times then you have done very well!"

To get fewer crowds go early or later in the day but you still want to be there when all the artists are there. There are lots of crowds but it is a must place to see and would likely go on Day 1 of your vacation in Rome along with the Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon and the Spanish Steps. The Trevi fountain is having a major restoration done at this time and you might want to Google to check prior to visiting it as it will a great disappointment the way it is now. There is a fence and the fountain has been drained. I would only see it if I thought I would not be back in Rome. I go there every trip to Rome so I can throw a coin over my left shoulder using my right hand to ensure my return to Rome. Seeing those things and a nice long lunch would complete my day so I can live \"la dolce vita\"If you are trying to pack everything into one day and include the Coliseum, be sure to do online booking for this prior to leaving the country or have your hotel book it as the line-ups at both coliseum and the Vatican Museum are horrendous!! To have less tourists when you see these attractions plan to go after 1PM while people go for lunch. If you want to see spectacular sculptures by Bernini and others you MUST go to Villa Borghese. You MUST book in advance and you are booked at a specific time as they only allow so many people per hour. The Piazza Navona has a beautiful piazza. Lots of decent artwork if you are wanting to pick up something from your travels."

The main square has a beautiful fountain at each end and one large one in the middle which are great for a photo opportunity. There are lots of stalls selling the same artwork you see around all of the tourist attractions in Rome. The major downside to this piazza is the number of people trying to sell you selfie sticks, scarves and various other items of tat.

Food over priced. Even a simple gnocchi is \u20ac15, plus service added to the bill that reads \"tip not included\". Unsure that the 15% service was if not a tip. One course pasta dish and diet coke came to \u20ac27! Outrageous even by my London standards. Still love the square though."

It's obviously a popular place for tourists, and that is reflected in the prices (almost \u20ac10 for a pint of peroni!) but it's kind of worth it just to take in the atmosphere. My mum and I are big fans of people watching and this is a great place to do it - our personal highlight was seeing a Nun on a tour with a selfie stick! Not something you see every day! Highly recommend this area, so long as you're prepared to pay a bit extra."

Today, he shape tells you as none of the Roman ruins are available, instead the place is a tribute to the art of Bernini and Borromeo. It is a busy, noisy place, despite being pedestrian. It is full of people selling rubbish, the restaurants are overpriced and tout constantly for custom, and it is an ideal spot to get your pockets picked.However, it is one of the nicest places in Rome. Just wander round and admire and then sit at a terrace to sip a prosseco or have a coffee. Sure you'll pay for the privilege, but prices are still low compared to other capitals and it is well worth enjoying the atmosphere of the place. We always go back,and we always stay for a drink."

Weekends are especially crowded and there are lots of distracting tourist oriented things going on - street performers, vendors, etc., that have nothing to do with the piazza or Rome. Don't miss going in lovely S. Agnese in Agone Church!"

The area has a crowd but is not overly crowded, plenty to see and do. Beautiful restaurants with great taste; also there were paintings and nicnacs being sold during my visit. The fountains are spectacular. The entire area is kept up with and very clean. Totally recommend this area for anybody who's visiting Rome the first time or for the 13th time. Will post pictures soon!"

So beautiful place to stroll and sit down and enjoy a sunny day.Though must be said, that indian salesmen with their selfie sticks, bubble guns and scarves are annoying. Same salesman can come to you for ten times in a row, not even one minute in between. Hold tight to your belongings, because they might get aggressive. I saw one man spitting passing people because they didn't buy anything.Few moments later the same guy attacked an elderly woman and trying to sell a toy really..) that makes noice when you throw it on a ground. He tried to push the lady to buy it. We were ready to go and defence this lady but luckily her husband stepped in picture here.So careful! Maybe not the best place to go with a full wallet and passports in pocket, but still totally worth visiting.Artwork being sold at the market isn't real. Buy only if you see an artist drawing or painting really. Many of the artworks are prints.. I walked with a real artist there and he told me things I wouldn't have known without his advice.The restaurants are there for tourists. If you're searching a real good place, try to find one where most of clients are Italian. There you are guaranteed that food is good, Italian and ok priced. Works all over in Rome.Take water with you and have a long, nice moment to sit and watch the beautiful art and busy Rome around you."

We won't name the restaurant as we were not disappointed with the food however it became a bit of an annoying game where I kept on taking the waiter back to the large menu to show him what we expected within the fixed price meal we had ordered.

Sitting on the balcony chairs, I think other tourists thought we were locals and were taking photo's of us! At the north-eastern corner of the Piazza is a very good explanation describing the history of the fountains. The Piazza at night comes alive with many people and sounds. In the mornings, when no one is around, it is very peaceful and only the birds are swirling around in the Piazza. Vist was June 18th - 20th 2014, not the one selected below."

We spend time taking pictures and then wondered around the Plaza that it was in."

We were lucky enough to be staying five minutes from this glorious Piazza,we were at the Via Die Coranari which in itself is a delight both day and night,and were told by out taxi driver that this was a pride of Rome and rightly so !On turning into it you are met by the most fabulous and elaborate fountains,beautiful white marble of sea gods and monsters ,and one representing four famous rivers of the world,all with tumbling water which cools the area around it,there are ornate benches to sit and watch the world go by and feel the coolness of the water.This area was a chariot racing arena and you can see that clearly from the long shape with rounded ends,it has a very posh Brazilian Embassy on one side,but loads of little shops and superb cafes,with lovely food,we tried a lot ,and the cafes are all red checked tablecloths,candles,flowers,chilled carafes of water,local bread and oil in wicker baskets,which often are free with meal,the water free of course and icy cold. The piazza is full of artists,which use every style and medium you can think of,from caricatures of yourself to high quality oils,and all done on the spot ! the colour and vibrancy is amazing and we went back quite a few times,we watched one old lady do oil painting with her thumb while balancing a canvas on her knees ! and they were lovely ! there are dozens of pretty small cobbled streets leading of from the Piazza and lots of interesting churches,one had the body and relics of a very good man called St.Camillus and they have his skeleton laid out under the actual body,fascinating ! the only thing is getting into churches before they close,they have strange opening hours,we walked to one which was supposed to be open according to the guide book ,but was totally closed,you get the feeling that you are not really wanted in some churches,you walk in,and they follow you with keys and want to lock up ! The one we really wanted to see was by the river and was were all the unknown dead were taken,it is full of high Gothic art and skeletons of the poor ,we would have liked to have seen that ! there was so much to look at around this area,find The Pinochio shop,as the writer was born in this area,the shop is full of working wooden toys and the walls and beams are full of mad working cuckoo clocks all going at once ! there are hundreds and you can order any type and pick it up in a couple of hours !The gelato shops are fantastic,fresh melon,local lemon and orange ices are the speciality,get yourself one,find a bench near the fountains and watch the world go by. This is a really lovely place to visit and eat, cannot recommend highly enough !"

In the middle there was an interesting dancing show of 5 very energetic young men and other very talented shows. We had Tartufo* in a v famous restaurant there.

From the piazza Rotondo in front of the Pantheon, take via Giustiniani, which leads to via Salvatore and right into Piazza Navona. You will go by the President of the Senate residence, so you will see lots of police cars. The square is long rectangular, which is different from others, a large fountain and obelisk in the center, and a more interesting fountain at the far end. Neptune with kneeling men holding water flowing vases. One side of Piazza Navona, has dozens of restaurants, and the other side the church, St. Agnese in Agone.

Everything from the famous statues, the palazzi, to the oval footprint of the former Stadium Domitian makes this piazza a fascinating visit. There are many cafes that ad to the bustling feeling of the place but I feel that the tourist traps that are inevitable repercussions of famous tourist attractions tainted my experience of the square. Men would always try to force you to buy roses, you hear people trying to sell you selfie sticks, and the worst are the glowing propellers that are thrown into the air. Maybe I visited at the wrong time. Policemen with motorbikes tried to catch the men selling fake handbags on the street. People were pushing and yelling and it all made my feel a little distressed. I also visited one night when a light show was being projected onto the building facade opposite the church. The atmosphere and energy was upbeat and fervent.I consider this a must-see in Rome - visit at different parts of the day - the early mornings (before 9) to see the statues in their most quiet form, early afternoon for a panini on the square, and perhaps, by favorite, right after dinner, when the statues are illuminated. Just try to ignore the street vendors."

Their \"stage\" is a spectacular ancient plaza arrayed around the centerpiece of Gian Lorenzo Bernini's stunning Four Rivers fountain honoring the Danube, the Nile, the Ganges and the Rio de la Plata. Bordered by restaurants and good quality shops with the backdrop of the beautiful 17th Century Baroque church of Sant'agnes in Agone silently overlooking the proceedings. Here's also where you'll find our favorite restaurant, Ristorante Tucci a family run place we've returned to for year after year and dinner after dinner.

There are three beautiful fountains, including Bernini's Four Rivers Fountain, and lots of street artists. Also beautiful by night with buskers and more street artists and a great atmosphere. Go both in the daytime and the night time if you can. It's not far from a lot of other famous places in Rome, within walking distance of the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Campo de Fiori etc. If you leave the piazza by the northern end (past the Fountain of Neptune) and turn left you can see some of the remains of the Stadium Domitian that the Piazza Navona was built over. (I think you can get proper access to the exhibit around the corner in Via di Tor Sanguigna, but we just had a look from the street)"

But that's ok.Piazza Navona is a must for those that like to take a leisurely stroll, people watch, have a leisurely brunch\\lunch, encounter some wonderful, historic buildings and monuments.Its a great way to spend some time when in Rome for sure - it shouldn't be on your top 5 list of things to do - its more a good way to spend free time when you are in Rome.Highly recommended regardless."

In the center of the square is the Fountain of the Four Rivers by Benini and the Obelisk of Domitian. At one end of the square is the Fontana del Moro and the other end is the Fountain of Neptune. There are around ten restaurants to eat at or just sit and have a drink. The square is very large and surrounded by other architectural buildings worth looking at. We come every time we are in Rome; see you there."

Enjoy the street artists, the tourists, the surroundings and just the mellow feeling it gives you. I am from the Netherlands and we have the perfect word to describe the atmosphere of this piazza which is 'gezellig'. Unfortunately there is no English word to translate this ;-). During day time it is a good place to rest your tired feet and it's also a great spot to have dinner. The Italians love this place and so did we! Ellen and Eva (Netherlands)"

This piazza is quite large and was always filled with fun things to watch. There were Buskers, performers and those people who paint themselves and stand motionless in the hot sun all day. I really admire that. The place was lined with wonderfully enticing cafes and restaurants. It was the custom for some of the owners to stand out the front and beckon you in. I saw many tourists getting quite offended by this but that is their way... And you know what they say, When in Rome.. We found that by politely saying \" maybe later..\" they would give you a card which was a coupon for a free drink if you returned. But do put this place on your list and better still go and stay at the the Navone palace Di Charme Hotel. You will be so glad you did. It's not 5 star but the ambience is wonderful just like the whole area. After looking al around Rome we decided we were in the best spot. We stayed in another area over behind the Vatican on the other side of the river and it was horrible. When we come back next year we will definitely return to Navone."

We had spent a short stay in Rome a few years ago and found the Piazza then, since on this occasion we were accompanied by friends, we took the opportunity to show them the sights. Our point of entry into Rome was near to the Vatican so we walked to the Piazza from there via the Castel Sant\u2019 Angelo and then the Pont Sant\u2019 Angelo with the ultimate goal of reaching the Coliseum and the Forum.The Piazza is one of our favourite squares in Rome with its three fountains, the central one with its large obelisk, large open spaces and small restaurants and caf\u00e9\u2019s round the outside. In the centre you will find street buskers, mime artists and painters all selling their wares similar to London\u2019s Covent Garden. We like to sit here and watch the world go by and if the heat becomes too fierce, standing in the vicinity of one of the fountains can give some relief. Photographers will find plenty of scope here with the fountains, people and surrounding architecture.On the day of our visit we arrived about mid-morning on a weekday and the piazza was still fairly quiet. We had a cup of coffee in a cafe in one corner of the square and watched an organised cycle tour depart for its next destination. Having set an agenda for the day, we only spent about forty minutes here before setting off again for the Pantheon, however we will always return here if we are in Rome in the future.Would recommend a visit here if you are visiting Rome and looking for a relaxing venue to spend a short time or either a drink or even a meal in a very pleasant area."

Very impressive architecture all around. There are plenty of restaurants that line the square and a plethora of talented musicians playing all around the square. It was wonderful to have dinner at the piazza, watching the people go by and listening to the melodious music.

From 1652 until 1866, when the festival was suppressed, it was flooded on every Saturday and Sunday in August in elaborate celebrations of the Pamphilj family. At the southwest end of the piazza is the ancient 'speaking' statue of Pasquino, erected in 1501. Romans could leave lampoons or derogatory social commentary attached to the statue. This piazza is very special...hopefully when you see it, the exception being the Christmas Market, there won't be rows of vendor stalls selling souvenirs, which is what we saw in the off-season. Visit the Palazzo Brachi and Palazzo Altemps museums nearby."

Beautiful architecture, stunning sculptures and fountains, street musicians and other street performers, street artists, and an abundance of restaurants. Eat at one of these if you want the fun atmosphere, but the food will probably not be the best you can find if you wander out to some side streets. If you aren't interested in the restaurants, try to avoid the front men who try to lure you into their place. They can become quite annoying if you let them get started. Otherwise, stroll about and watch spray paint artists, watercolorists and musicians entertain you."

Cafes at the fringe of the piazza.Not a square but rectangular plaza. Should have more of these around but unfortunately most of the piazzas are now used as car parks rather than for human gatherings away from the madding traffic as drivers here are mad!Take your photos and move on. There are so many lovely other sights and sites in Rome and you can't do them all in the time most tourists have. Doing Europe sensibly financially is possible when you don't do much shopping and pay for all the tourists sites. There are many that do not have a fee. Like to Roman Forum can be done free from the outside. You save time and money. If you paid to get in, it would be good as it's not expensive but here it is important as time is saved. Lots of it, I mean at least a minimum of 2-3 hours off your day. Whilst you walk around the outs,die, you are still walking around to the other sights in Rome, why not?A walking day around Rome can get you to many sites for free. And the piazza Navona is one of them. Lovely. It was starting to rain so the crowds left. We took our opportunity to take photos with less people though the grey skies didn't help the photos but I preferred this to having too many people around in my photo."

With high buildings on all sides, it feels almost like the courtyard of a palace, and features three gorgeous fountains. The central one, Bernini's \"Fontana dei Fiumi\", is really breathtaking and makes a stunning focal point. The various cafes and restaurants on the periphery of the square are generally quite good, though they can be pricey. The place has a great buzz, but what rather spoils it is the horde of artists clogging up the centre. There are three basic types: the purveyors of rather garish oil images of local spots, the \"spray paint over stencil\" artists, and the caricaturists. The work produced is so similar within each of the three groups that it would be much better just to have one representative of each, thereby freeing up a lot of space in the square. Nevertheless, it is a very lovely place, but best visited at about 7.00 in the morning,"

We walked through this piazza several times during our week in Rome and it was very cool each time to see the different acts, artists and goods being sold. Definitely would not recommend eating at any of the restaurants in the piazza as the prices are much higher than other areas. We ate at one pizza/pasta place for the nice view and just felt ripped off and frankly unwelcomed after they lured us in. Just enjoy the views and the music from the fountains and benches!"

It was once a stadium with many battles held there. Leave at the exit Via Agonale, turn left and you will find a museum that showcases original features of the site and artifacts from the gladiatorial days.If you love to people watch, relax at an outside bar or enjoy perusing the art on sale and street entertainers this is the place to be. I've seen some say better than Trevi! Well there is water flowing from the magnificent fountains (no scaffold, unlike Trevi) and the area is more spacious away from the more traditional tourist attractions and the fountains are quite beautiful."

We were served by this rather pig of a man who thought because we did not want a bottle of his overpriced wine we weren't really worth serving. Well we did order a Pasta Napoli and we would have been better off bringing a can of Heinz Spaghetti with us. What a disappointment the Italian Pasta was slap bang in the middle of Rome. Before eating in the Piazza, check out the small streets at the back of the restaurants. The meals there seem more inviting. On the other side to the restaurants,are all the nick nack shops selling all of the usual suspects of rubbish.

As opposed to the infamous disappointment of Fontana Di Trevi which was closed for restoration in the middle of August, we had a marvellous night out in this piazza with street artists' music and great food nearby (not on the piazza as the places there have mediocre reviews). Both fountains are for very impressive pictures."

We visited in July 2015 when it was hot but there wasn't that many crowds so could enjoy the general ambience of this piazza. We had researched about Rome and things to do and we knew Piazza Nabona had three magnificent fountains albeit not on the same scale as Trevi Fountain. Saying this though these fountains for me were even better as Trevi Fountain was under essential renovation works so I didn't see it in its full glory. Another thing I loved about Piazza Navona was the amount of space around the fountains compared to the small area near Trevi Fountain.Piazza Navona is a large outside area which has three lovely fountains. The central one is Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers). At the southern end is the Fontana del Moro and at the northern end is the Fountain of Neptune. All three fountains are beautiful in their own rights and there are plenty of photo opportunities around these amazing fountains.There are also some churches, restaurants, shops, cafes around this area but I would advise to go to a restaurant or cafe nearby, down one of the side streets, as you will pay for the privilege if you have a drink/food in the piazza. Piazza Navona is a lovely place to enjoy being in Rome as you can sit by one of the fountains enjoying the atmosphere or looking at the drawings/paintings of the many artists working there. Beware of the many street sellers tiring to sell various items like selfie sticks etc.Definitely would recommend."

While walking around Rome on a recent vacation, we stumbled onto a relatively new attraction - the Stadio Di Domiziano. This is an amazing, unique testimony to sport history. These ruins of a gladiators stadium were discovered almost intact under the streets of Rome. Sections have been uncovered and are now available for viewing by the public. The Colosseum has been dated back to Emperor Domitian (81-96 A.D.). It was the first stadium built in masonry in the history of Rome and was designed principally for athletic competitions. We found it to be beautiful and fascinating and hope to see more new discoveries on future trips to Rome."

Silly us decided to do some exploring in the prime of the day when local establishments close from 12-230 for nap time because of the heat during the day. Baking in full sun with little shade is no fun! Piazza Novona was bustling with people. Squinting eyes, a lot of selfie sticks, smart people sitting at a cafe in the shade while people watching. It is very beautiful and should be seen, but there are grander Piazza's through the city and littler ones too. Advisable to wear a hat, have a fan and some water. Stay hydrated!"

In the evening it transforms into a very relaxing and beautiful place, where the fountain is lit up. The artists are in the middle where you can admire their work and in the evening, you come across, musicians, singers, gymnasts etc. There are plenty of places where you can eat/drink and a range of prices. Out of our 3 night stay, we spent 2 evenings there. Just mesmerising! For those of you familiar with Covent Garden, its a bit like that in the evening. Highly recommended"

Filled with highly talented artists, there will be many painters, dancers and singers. The place is filled with restaurants. These restaurants are expensive and not that great. We spent our evening watching the sunset in the company of amazing music and superb coffee.You can buy many painting here.

It also boasts one of the 4 live video cams stationed throughout the city. This piazza displays the magnificent creations of both Bernini and Borromini: respectively, Four Rivers and Neptune's fountains. It also has two other fountains. At the southern end is the Fontana del Moro sculpted by Giacomo della Porta to which, in 1673, Bernini added a statue of a Moor, or African, wrestling with a dolphin. At the northern end is the Fountain of Neptune also created by della Porta. The Church of St. Agnes in Agnone is also located here. Its vibrant history is inextricably attached to the great ancient Roman athletics stadium, Stadium Domitian, which used to occupy the area of the present piazza."

But there are more: the three fountains with their own stories (you have to read a little bit about this, you wil be surprised ) and the beautiful chrurch are something you cannot avoid. But the most important thing at Piazza Navona is something pretty difficult to describe: this is the atmnosphere of this place. At the moment you arrive there you can feel it. This is totally different than the feeling you can have visiting Piazza Di Spagna per exemple. I do not know why but this is special.This is easy to reach Piazza Navona. Not so far from the Pantheon and the Vatican. I have heard a roman saying: \"If you do have not seen Piazza Navona, it is like do not having seen Rome\". This is not really true because Rome has so much to offer to the visitors, but this is true that each visit to Rome I always spend a few hours there... to feel the place and its special atmosphere. I highly recommend that you do the same."

Meandering through the small cobblestone streets searching for the famed Piazza was fun in itself, then all of a sudden it opens up into this huge square of activity.We arrived later in the day, around 6:00pm and considered finding something to eat. During peak tourist season, it was very busy and crowded with other tourists just as ourselves. Bit of a task to get a few pictures in front of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers) with its obelisk jutting out of the center. As with all statues found around Rome, the detail in the carvings were astounding and with the sun beginning to set the light was casting wonderful shadows high-lighting some of the exquisite detail. We had done a Vatican tour in the morning and the first thing that my 10-year-old daughter pointed out was the Papal Coat of Arms with the keys and tiara, which was also found on the Sant'Agnese in Agone facing the fountain.It was a very enjoyable evening strolling around the Piazza, looking at the various wares being sold by street vendors and seeing the other sights and sounds around. The other two fountains at each end of the square were much smaller in scale, but not in beauty. The Fontana Moro made me laugh a bit watching the \"spitting guys\". Again, I caught some beautiful light while gazing at the Fontana del Nettuno, which I loved immensely.We did not choose to eat there this time, but the restaurants looked excellent - and had prices to match. If you are looking for a nice dinner out, I would go there. We weren't really dressed the part that day and opted for something quicker and less formal. I would also like to return later at night to experience the fountains illuminated.In my opinion, your trip to Rome wouldn't be complete without at least visiting Piazza Navona."

Beware of the restaurants around the piazza navona however as they charge way too much for the food and by just sitting around the corner not in the piazza navona itself you pay half the price! Take a few coins for the street performer of your choice for a bit of fun."

Its extremely busy, but the piazza is quite large with beautiful buildings on 3 sides, and cafes & restaurants on one side. There is a fantastic fountain in the middle of the piazza which is really the main focal point. We sat and had lunch with a glass of wine watching the world go by. The only thing that completely ruined this area is the amount of people with selfie sticks, either selling them or using them to take photos. It was actually ridiculous as you could not move in any direction without bumping into or being offered a selfie stick. They have been banned at the colosseum, so hopefully the rest of Rome follows!"

Located right in the center of Rome; we happened across thus important site on an early trip to Rome; there was some sort of \"demonstration\" (read labor action) so it was crowded, but we enjoyed the fountain at the center. There are restaurants surrounding the Piazza, but I would recommend staying out of them. If you take one of the \"side streets\" that leave the Piazza, I believe that you would be better served. Guys \"inviting\" you into their establishments is not the best recommendation! In any event, there is great people watching and I went back there one day in the \"golden light\" of the last afternoon and got some fabulous shots of the statues."

So pick the hour of the day you visit it. Right in the center is the Fontana dei 4 fiumes, which is already worth the visit. You can throw a coin in it while The Trevis is closed and wish for happiness forever or simply for the crowds disappear for a few minutes. The Piazza has two other fountains, one in each side. Some portraitists will try to hassle you into their jobs - not worth it. The best thing is to seat at the ice cream place os one of the sides (you wont miss it) take some pictures and post in the instagram for your friends go crazy with jealousy. It is not a cheap thrill. For brazilians a special treat. At the end of the piazza is the fantastic Palazzo Pamphilj ( famous papal family), where is located the Brazilian Embassy, the nicest by far in the city. Visits can be arranged at the Embassy site."

This review is something like a \"Rome's guide for Dummies\" as this was the first time my wife and self had been to the city, and we found things somewhat confusing. It is relatively easy to get lost in Rome, as there are so many narrow streets where all the buildings are built up. its like a rabbit warren. The sheer heat in the City Center is so intent, it zaps the life out of you walking around for hours trying to find what you are looking for.We had picked the Piazza Navona area because after spending hours on Google, it was clear that this was right in the center, and walking distance to Trevi Fountain, Vatican, Pantheon and Spanish Steps.Left Ciampino airport on a bus that cost 4 euros each to the main City bus Terminal that is around 3km from Piazza Navona.First Tip.....Take a cab from there to your hotel. We decided to walk and take in the ambiance of the city....big mistake. To start with, the heat was unbearable after walking for an hour. Due to perspiration, my T-shirt couldn't have been more wet if i had stood under a shower. Secondly....crossing a road in Rome requires you to have some sort of death wish. If you cant run, best stay at home....If you can run but are bad with your nerves, take your Diazapam....and if you fancy attempting suicide, Walk when the green man tells you to walk.A red traffic light in Rome means \"STOP...But Only If You Want To\"Eventually found Piazza Navona. It is definitely the area to be based. The Piazza is a large open square , i would think around the size of a football pitch, with the stunning \"Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi on \" placed in the center. The square has Eateries/Restaurants around the sides facing the mass array of us tourists, entertainers, artists and musicians. We preferred to eat in a similar square about a 3 minute walk away(campo de fiori), which was a bit smaller and quieter.The majority of the Restaurants around both squares are around the same sort of price for similar menus. The menus cater for tourists, and are not what you would call great restaurants, but it all depends on taste. I like salads, and these cost around the 10 euro mark. My first night was a Tuna salad which was just ok...a mound of iceberg and tinned tuna. the second night was ham....a mound of iceberg and packet ham...kind of like what you would rustle up at home.Starters like Bruchetta and soup are around 6 euros and pasta, spaghetti and lasagna around 10 euros each. Meat and fish dishes around 18 euro mark.However....sat outside and listening to the musicians in Piazza Navona, with a cool mist blowing over you from the air conditioning fans that all the restaurants have, may be idyllic, but beware. Some of the staff at these places are like Scorpions, and if not handled correctly, you are going to get stung. In our 3 nights there, i was charged different prices for the same drink,at the same restaurant and after handing over 60 euros for a 54 euro bill, the change wasn't brought back. Every restaurant bangs a service charge on top of the bill anyway, so if they can fleece another tenner out of you....they will.The drinks prices can get a bit silly. They know that a lot of people who come to Italy will want a glass or two of prosecco. Certain places will charge over 6 euros for the tiniest of glasses, which is a bit rich seeing the stuff in supermarkets for a couple of euros a bottle. I drink Gin ( a bit too much... but Hey-Ho) with a splash of diet coke, (yep...they thought what a weirdo as well), at a cost of around 8-10 euros.On the whole....This is Rome, and the Piazza Navona is very popular, so they basically charge what they want as they know people will pay it.Would i go back and do it all again ?.....ABSOLUTELYP.S.....Dont forget the City Tax @ 12 euros per night that every hotel charges when you check out."

            "review": "An Entertaining Leftover!. This Piazza is a leftover from the old Roman Circus called Circo Agone (games Circus) and nicknamed after it's originator, the Emperor Domitiam (81-96) - younger son of the first Flavian emperor, Vespasian (builder of the Colisseum). The Piazza is roughly the open area of the old Circus. In medieval times it contained the old City Market - later moved. In the mid 17th century, Pope Innocent X (a member of the Pamphili family) remodelled the Piazza into virtually what we see today. His family Palazzo was and still does face the Piazza. The great central Fountain of the Four Rivers is topped by the obelisk of Domitian. The southern Fountain of the Moor, was damaged recently by a vandal, but has been restored. A security note while on the Piazza: there is physical and video security everywhere, not only because of the art and the vendors, but because there is an Embassy there. - that of Brazil. The fountain at the north end is that of Neptune. Art continues to influence the Piazza, here is where you can purchase some contemporary art or have your image sketched. Stores and restaurants here are overpriced, but it can all be found here (from a toy store to a rug dealer) and where else can you get a meal inside an old Roman Circus? Nighttime on the Piazza is much more lively especially around and in the various Piazza restaurants. If going at night, be cautious with your wallet and handbag at all times. Be aware of those around you at all times. Ensure you have secure transportation into and out of the PiazZa after dusk. Just off of the SW side of the Piazza is the 'Speaking Statue' of Pasqualino, to which Romans have been attaching scandalous and s urrilous notes about others for literally centuries. Finally, a dining note: there is a wine bar / restaurant next to Pasquilino called Cul de Sac. Patronise this iwonderful place if you get the chance. It is a favourite of both locals (there is an elderly gentleman who comes in at the same time every day and has a single piece of Tiramisu), and tourists alike (see my review), one word first, however - try to go in off peak hours, such as right after opening, early afternoon (siesta time) and early evening 6-7:30).

It was a fun and romantic atmosphere that my wife and I both enjoyed. During the day, there are two beautiful churches to visit as well."

If you are wandering around in Rome as you undoubtedly will find yourself doing, consider including Pizza Navona into your stroll. I wouldn't advise going to any of the restaurants that border this square, but the actual atmosphere is akin to Covent garden with street performers scattered around and a genuine buzz in the air. When the sun sets the square looks lovely and provides some really nice photo opportunities around the fountain. Short of being somewhere to relax or as a stop off point for a drink you won't find much more to do here. That doesn't mean it isn't worth visiting though. As stated please read reviews for restaurants that border such populist locations to avoid disappointment and some of the many scams that operate in such areas."

One of numerous Piazzas in Rome, this is famous for it's three fountains - with the central Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (fountain of the four rivers) taking centre stage. Built around this is a series of somewhat cheap souvenir stores, although none of the sellers are particularly aggressive which is appreciated. Be careful before buying one of the generic art pictures - some of the cheaper ones (usually those left laying on the ground) are high quality zerox colour photocopies of actual paintings!It gets a bit busy here during the day so night time may be a better time to visit. If you come at meal times, don't eat in restaurants around the piazza - they are overpriced. You are better off getting your food a couple of streets away and bringing it here. You can't dip your hands in the fountains (officials enforce this).It's within walking distance of the pantheon and the two should ideally be combined as part of a walking tour to Romes famous sites."

Three fantastic fountains, numerous restaurants with al fresco dining to watch the world go by and architecture that leaves no doubt as where you are. There are some rather aggressive street vendors who are definitely trying to get some of your vacation money, but if you don't give them any attention they are swiftly off to the next passerby. My wife and I felt very safe as we strolled the area and really appreciated the numerous seating areas. After a long day of doing what tourists do, a seat close to a refreshing fountain was a true respite! Enjoy all that Piazza Navona has to offer. Plan on at least sampling a restaurant and taking in all the sights and sounds that make this a truly memorable experience."

The piazza is full of street performers and vendors, but they aren't overly aggressive, and the area near the main fountain gets some nice afternoon shade.

One of the things that we do like there is that there's no cars or motorcycles allowed so you can walk in the streets and in the center section without worrying about being run down by a motorcycle or getting hit by a car. This is a great place to enjoy part of your day. bob232015"

Historically it was a stadium and of Baroque architecture. There are fountains and gorgeous restaurants, bars, coffee shops line the edge. The middle of the piazza is a wonderful array of tourist gifts and souvenirs, including prints of Rome and Italy which can be framed, mounted as you like. There are street artists willing to paint you on the spot. All sorts of things going on. There have been movies made here and famous visitors. All in all a great spot for lunch. Prints are cheaper to buy in say Trastevere than here. Its a tourist spot so be careful. If you love photography, as my friend does, she enjoyed it!"

A few tips: If it gets too hot during the day, leave your fountains and piazzas for touring during night time. Walking at night through the streets of Rome it's also another experience on its own. Make sure you take a break if you can during the hottest time of day and don't miss Piazza Navona."

There are many restaurants in the piazza, so no need to go hungry if you're looking for a meal or a snack. And there were many \"entertainers\" including jugglers and a man dressed in a tutu performing strange ballet moves for money.

There was no shade or tree to sit under and the square was full of street merchants selling hand bags and selfie sticks. We did not waste time there and walked to the Pantheon which was nearby.

We were staying just behind Brazilian Embassy on the Piazza Navona for 7 days so frequently wandered through the Piazza at all times of the day and night.A meeting area offering a wide selection of restaurants market vendors selling painting and street entertainers. It's a great central location to stay whilst vising Rome and hub to explore the wonderful sights of Rome.I personally loved grabbing an early morning coffee and relaxing at one of the restaurants when it's less crowded . Loved it!"

Overall is was as good as Rome gets for me.I've seen the Forum, St Peter's, the Spanish Steps but they are not what Rome is all about for me. The only thing I enjoy these days is the lively but not too crazy piazzas.Piazza Navona is all that. Now if they could just get rid of those pesky guys pushing flowers and selfie sticks."

The Piazza is huge, shaped like a long oval and surrounded with many outside restaurants and places to shop and watch people.

I had the most expensive meal of our stay here, but my favourite meal of the stay as well, I had the best Carbona and dark chocolate gelato I have ever had and probably will every have.There are lots of craft stalls selling art and various souvenirs, we bought a couple of paintings to bring back to the UK with us.

Firstly, there is a taxi rank just off the piazza which is handy if your hotel is a little way out as ours was. The fountains are lovely especially the middle one, get up close to really enjoy the detail, then sit back with a glass of wine at one of the numerous bars and restaurants to just enjoy the view. Its clear from reading the other reviews, that you either get this place or you don't. Well we did. The buskers are great, and the waiters do not allow the street vendors to harass you, so if you don't like that sort of thing you will be ok. There are lots of beautiful churches just a short walk from the piazza which contain statues and paintings which are well worth seeing and offer free seats and shelter from the heat on hot days! We ate in the piazza 3 times in 5 days as we felt really comfortable here and it is a good place to start or finish your day. The sound of the slashing water is calming and relaxing and we thought the area was lovely. As the Trevi fountain is being restored at the moment it cannot really be appreciated so this is a great substitute. You can only speak as you find and I know that our next visit to Rome will begin and end in Piazza Novona just as this one did!"

They are the heart and soul of the city, with a feel-good atmosphere about them. Piazza Navona is one of the biggest and best examples and we enjoyed our two visits during our recent four days in Rome. The fountains are beautiful and seem to invite people to sit around them; the sound of the water even helps you feel good.If you want to dine, there are maybe 7 or 8 restaurants in the square itself to choose from, and several others just off the square; you will be spoiled for choice. If you are one of those people whose first thought is price comparison; then find a less up-beat place to dine, in a less popular place. The prices will be cheaper there, but the experience, well, not be as good!Wandering vendors populate the piazza, the smart ones will try to engage you in conversation; you can just ignore them. They know that tourists like to say where they are from \u2013 why I don\u2019t know - so they may ask you that question. Just ignore it and you will be left alone. I notice many American (and other) reviewers mention these pests, but at least they are offering something for your money. In the two cities in America that I know best, (San Francisco and Las Vegas) you will find the streets of the tourist areas and busy stop lights, populated by the homeless and down and outs, and all they offer is a cardboard sign begging for money.I have never seen that anywhere on this entire trip through Switzerland and Italy, or for that matter, on our trip to Argentina last year, not \u201cOnly in America,\u201d but pretty common none the less."

Unquestionably the central fountain by Bernini in the piazza represents a brilliant achievement however most visitors only spend a few minutes appreciating this monument before beginning the real sport, people watching. The piazza is is a wonderful circus center stage with jugglers, tap dancers, street merchants and performers of all kinds seeking to extract a few Euros. Whether you're part of the market buying small toys or merely watching the activity from one of the cafes that ring the piazza this is a part of the Roman tourist experience that should be enjoyed."

It was on mine.I am not sure what I expected but basically on arrival it did not live up to my expectations.In reality a very large piazza, absolutely cram packed with people, sellers of all manner of art work, people sketching portraits, lots of noise and congestion with a perimeter dotted with cafes and restaurants.Thinking that if we ate somewhere away from the actual Piazza we would have less chance of being gouged price wise we were wrong. Eating in a quaint caf\u00e9 on the street behind the Piazza we had a lovely meal but did not realise that we would be charged for a carafe of water (not mineral), service and an overinflated charge for a couple of slices of bread. It was the most expensive lunch we had on our whole trip.Despite my disappointment I am still glad we took the time to visit. Its size is impressive, there are some great photo ops of the buildings and fountain and its nice to tick it off our 'must see' list."

If you want to rest a little then go to this square and sit down in one of the outdoor bars. Enjoy an Aperol spritz and just dream away.

Again the best times are early in the morning or late in the afternoon to beat the bus crowds.If you chose afternoon there are many cafes along the western perimeter, which are in the shade, to have a beverage and take in this piece of Rome. There are also some benches to sit and relax but they tend to get snapped up as soon as they are vacated.It's amazing to think that this piazza would not be possible if it wasn't for the Romans and their construction of the aqua ducts that brought water to Rome. All three fountains wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the Romans and they all have a water theme. In the centre stands the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi by Bernini. It's a absolutely fantastic sculpture. From all sides it is wonderful to look at and offers great opportunity for photos and the selfie. At the Northern end is the Fountain of Neptune and again a wonderful sculpture surrounded by water. The cafes at this end also sell gelato, which seems to be popular in the hot afternoons. Still magnificent though.Whilst we visited this time in the afternoon, I know from previous visits that night time it's equally as majestic under light and worth dining at one of the restaurants."

The square itself is surrounded by a multitude of cafes, many touting for business even more aggressively than the street vendors. Rather than eating on the square itself, wander around and watch, maybe visit the great pen, ink and paper shop (don't, however, expect any service, friendly or otherwise) and then head into the back streets near the Musea Di Roma where there are several really good restaurants, already reviewed by TAs. Anyone interested in visiting this square already knows about its significance, or can look it up. Personally, as a piazza, I found this one to be far more interesting than, say, the Pantheon's."

The origins of Piazza Navona reach back to at least the 1st century AD when it formed part of the open space of the Stadium of Domitian where Romans would have come to watch sports and races. The area seems to have served as a city market from the 15th century onward. You can find many lovely Baroque style buildings around the square, these stem from the 17th century when the piazza was also adorned with its fountains, including the famous Fountain for Four Rivers by Bernini in 1651. Now, the modern Piazza Navona is lined with cafes, artists, performers, a lovely church and three fountains. It is great place of to spend time during visits to Rome and is camera friendly during both the day and night. We always try to visit at least a couple times when in Rome. Note: There are many attractions at and around Piazza Navona so you can plan to spend at least a 1/2 a day or more in this area of Rome."

Artists selling their work and small restaurants all over the place. However don't eat in the restaurants overlooking the piazza if you are on a budget. Go for restaurants in the narrow streets surrounding the place. The place is also loaded with souvenir shops,gelaterias , and bars. The piazza is also very romantic and beautiful at night. So don't miss it."

All dishes were excellent with personal more romantic touches.We also went Tucci. Waiter was also great. Food was amazing. Lobster was excellent.Back roads have some great restaurants too. U do get charged more sitting outside \u20ac5 per person.PLACE TO AVOID: on back street is La Torre. Rude obnoxious manager named christian. Food was terrible and wrong orders. When mentioned he took the wrong unprofessional approach and gets quite vocal and in ur face woman or not. Threw us out without eating. Made us pay as threatened to call police. All nice to get u seated but poor service ever ! Other local restaurants said it happens all the time there ! Ruined our last night and impression.But everywhere else was excellent reason why we tried numerous restaurants. There is always one bad apple. Enjoy ur trip"

Also be advised the Gypsy beggars are a nuisance and get right in your face with a plastic cup. They may pick your pocket as well, so watch out for groups of them especially with children or babies they drop (dolls) so when you try to help in horror you're picked by a kid with them or coming from behind.

The square is surrounded by a few restaurants and caffees and is not overcrowded and Piazza di Spagna or the Vaticani. Go anytime and return by the sunset to take amazing photos. Then go back again at night for a romantic walk."

A wide open space dominated by the magnificent Bernini fountain, which is a mesmerising work of art.The piazza was very crowded when we visited, and you could take the opportunity to have your portrait painted by the numerous artists waiting there.It is advisable to eat out of the main piazza, as like most areas of interest, it costs more for the view! However if you want to take it all in, sit and enjoy!"

This is a beautiful square which has amazing architecture in the form of both fountains and buildings. The square is edged by bars and restaurants where you will be charged a lot more than the normal price for the privilege of sitting in such a lovely location. We (my wife and I) made do with standing at a bar where, by law, they must display a price list for all beverages sold. It doesn't insulate you from paying too much but greatly reduces the possibility. As with many of the other Rome attractions you are plagued by sellers of rubbish (selfy sticks) who, if you let them, can spoil your enjoyment. My advice would be go early in the morning and have a coffee standing at one of the many bars."

            "review": "A magical place to hang out in the evening.. We have visited Rome twice now and this place seems to be the hub of the nightlife. What I like about Rome is that you feel safe at night. There are no intimidating drunks, and people of all ages seem to know how to have a good time side by side.On our second visit, we rented an apartment; just 10 minutes walk from \u201cPiazza Navona\u201d. We seemed to end up here most nights, mainly because it just buzzes with so much to do and see.I must mention that I would not eat here, as the prices to sit around the Piazza and look trendy, will cost you 3 times what it costs to sit out and look trendy in one of the paths that lead off of \u201cPiazza Navona\u201d.So let me tell what to expect, if you visit when it gets dark. First, if you can, don\u2019t eat out until at least 9pm, as this when sitting and eating \u201cal fresco\u201d, is at its best. And eating out is the best way to enjoy Rome.A lot of the coach tours have left, and then the locals come out. Music, wine, good food and laughter, just ooze out of all the entrances to this Piazza.When you enter it, it will be full of stalls selling art, applying henna tattoos, portrait artists,trinkets & gifts for sale and all sorts.There are quite often musicians playing. One night there was an old guy playing Rock n Roll on his fender electric guitar. A couple who had cycled down, parked up their bikes, and started to perform an impromptu mixture of Lambada and Jive dancing. A crowd gathered and the smiles on the crowds face made you realise that this place offers more than the travel guides will tell you.And how can I mention Italy and not mention the amazing ice cream. There are numerous Gelatos\u2019 around the edge of the Piazza. It is a place where you can bring your kids of all ages, or turn up on your own and people watch.We ended up having a few glasses of wine each night, and then had the challenge of finding our way back to our apartment, through the maze of side streets.I love Rome, could spend a week or two each year in it. And this Piazza would be the place I end up each night, as it is just simply special."

The central fountain called the four rivers, has an egypcian obelisc, it was completly made by Bernini. The other two, one called Fountain of Neptuno and the other one Fontana del Moro, were made by della Porta before the Bernini one. Bernini considered this fountains an asymmetrical composition, so he decided to add an sculpture in each of them.

The piazza is full of artists and street performers, so for the price of a coffee or gelato you can sit and soak up the entertainment as long as you'd like. I didn't want to leave."

It steals the thunder of the grand baroque church designed by his arch-rival Borromini that towers over the fountain. Throngs of people, locals and tourists, goggle at the sights and produce a constant buzz of oohs and ahs while they wander around the sights, enjoy the musicians, dodge the hawkers, and munch on Roman pizza in local outdoor caf\u00e9s.

Each of the famous Roman squares has its very special appeal and unique personality; Piazza del Popolo, Piazza Venezia, Piazza de' Fiori, Piazza della Rotonda - they all offer their own unforgettable character but we loved Piazza Navona and couldn't get enough of it. Its three (!) fountains, Fontana del Moro (partially by Bernini) at the south end, Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi by Bernini at the square's center featuring one of Rome's several Egyptian obelisks, and Fontana del Nettuno at the piazza's north end, all combine and add up to create an absolutely magnificent, unreal, and captivating fantasy of an atmosphere. Because of the square's original use as a horse track, the Stadium of Domitian (in the Ist century AD), Piazza Navona features a very unusual rectangular shape, that makes it very different from the rest of Roman piazzas, and it really stands apart.At night, the square lives and breathes its fascinating life: the terraces filled with people, the lights, the crowds, the music... The selfie-sticks and bootlegged Gucci and Prada bags sellers may get too annoying at times, but hey, it is a tourist capital of the world and it is to be expected."

As Four seniors, two with limited walking ability, we were sceptical if we could do this, but I have never seen Rome at night and wanted to do it. We were staying near St. Peters, so we started there, walked to Castle S. Angelo and the river bridges, all spectacularly lit, then to Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, Piazza Venezia and then took the bus back (64) to our room near the Vatican. It was great and the pictures came out beautifully. We were very tired, but it was worth it."

Fun in the mornings before the bus loads arrive. Built in the 1st century as an arena for pagan games The central fountain by Bernini is a baroque marvel. Rumour has it that one of the river gods is throwing his hand up in horror at the ugly church by his rival Borromini. Amusing, except that the fountain preceded the church. For wheelchair users, there is a small curb surrounding the centre of the Piazza which is best accessed if unassisted from the south end or the centre of the East side."

The Navona Piazza consists of three fountains and a great church.The church was closed when I arrived so I couldn't visit it, just saw it on the outside. The fountain in the middle is called the Fountain of the four rivers and has four places where water comes out and some big statues on it.There are other two fountains, in the right and in the left of it, very nice too.In the space between, there are artists showing the works and selling them to amateurs of their art. Some of them do paintings right there in front of you. I saw an artist doing a painting using sprays of paint. The painting took shape right in front of me and I was amazed to see things that seemed not to have any sense at the beginning, forming shapes and meaning to the end. To be honest, I am now sorry I didn't buy it as it was only 10 euros. I imagine it's difficult for the artists as well to do their work. This one was sitting on the floor and had a lot of paint sprays near him and I wondered how he would carry them every day to that piazza and back home.I recommend paying a visit to this place as it has its charm and artistic touch."

It's a real hassle to get up so early especially on a holiday, but the reward you get for doing so will make the whole trip worth it, and you will remember the wonderful atmosphere that most people, romans included, never experience.

During the day it's beautiful but with more people, longer waits to view or take photos, to eat, to order food and to move around. Of course being a top of the line tourist spot you must be careful and be aware of your surroundings. After visiting the under construction Fountain Trevi, Piazza Navona is a find. We made it a point to stop here whenever in the surrounding area."

If you're not so hungry then you must try the ice cream. I would also recommend the limoncello from sanremo, not cheap at \u20ac17 for 2, however it's worth every penny and you get a very large measure too. It's worth wandering through this square by day and by night as it's very different at various times of the day. Highly recommend going here."

However, it makes a big difference when you visit because it is normally full of tourists, cartoon artists and trinket-sellers, which do take the shine off the experience. I would recommend visiting at a quiet time of the day (not easy) and my favourite by far is about seven o-clock in the morning.

The large and lively square features no less than three magnificent fountains. Another eyecatcher is the baroque church of Sant'Agnese in Agone. The square is built on the former Domitian's stadium, built by emperor Domitian in 86 AD. Hence the long, oval shape of the square. The stadium, which had a larger arena than the Colosseum was mainly used for festivals sporting events. Domitian's Stadium - The stadium was known as 'Circus Agonalis' (competition arena). It is believed that over time the name changed to 'in agone' to 'navone' and eventually to 'navona'."

Whether you're just people watching at one of the numerous cafes or admiring the beautiful sculptured fountains, the work of Bernini, it's a visual treat. The square itself dates back to 80 AD when it was built as a racetrack. There is also an amazing church that is absolutely breathtaking when you wander inside. Along the piazza are artists and vendors selling their wares. I found the Piazza Navona a worthwhile visit and plan to return on my next trip to Rome."

My wife and I have been to Piazza Navona many times over the last 12 years \u2013 it\u2019s one of those places we always want to visit when we\u2019re in Rome. We\u2019ve seen the Piazza when it\u2019s been overflowing \u2013 body to body \u2013 for political demonstrations, but most of the time it\u2019s a fabulous place just to walk around in. The three fountains in the Piazza are awe-inspiring; the Piazza is huge, beautiful, and ringed by unique shops, caf\u00e9s, and restaurants (which tend to be pricey). Most of the time, there are street vendors who\u2019ve set up their wares, mostly artwork, all over the Piazza. The last time we were there, however, it was raining, and raining heavily; the street vendors were selling umbrellas and ponchos. In many ways, the rain contributed to our enjoyment of the Piazza; it was almost empty and the shops and caf\u00e9s surrounding it weren\u2019t crowded at all."

The middle one the most beautiful. It is the work of Bernini. It has four statues in the corners squirting water. They represent the Danube, The Ganges, The Nile and The Rio re la Plata. Each fountain is made of marble and are fantastic works. The square is also called AGONAL CIRCUS. It occupies the land and boundaries of the old ancient Circus of Domitian. The Church Santa' Agnese in Agone is located in the middle on the Square. It has beautiful mable statues in all corners of the church. It has a painted ceilings which are also very beautiful. The dome is decorated beautifully in mainly gold. The floors are made of amazing ornate marble. Amazing for what is a local church. Worth a look. If you are at the top of the hill at The Spanish Steps. This dome and the dome from the Vatican are what you see on the skyline. This square is the place to be for food. Loads of restaurants to choose from. Every establishment unique with the prettiest shop fronts. Lots of paintings of the shop fronts can be brought on the Square. Worth leaving at least two hours for this square alone. Highly recommended."

After being in Castel Sant Angelo, heading toward this piazza you can find colorful small streets with local stores. I really enjoy this stroll. Once you get there, feels like an open space in the middle of a buzzing city, a lost square where you can seat with a cup of coffee and admire the sculptures there. The main attraction is the obelisk by Bernini. In one of its sculptures in this obelisk, you can see one man that is facing the church with horror with his left hand trying to cover his eyes. Many people say that has this gesture because the church was built by Borromini, and it depicts the ugly architecture of the church, but in fact, the obelisk was built first than the church. This church is the Saint' Agnese in Agone with a baroque style. Francesco Borromini, was one of the architects that were involve in its construction, Bernini's adversary. You can find local artists in this piazza selling their paintings and drawings. Being in this piazza, is being in the center of everything, that's why if you want to get a hotels close to this area, they are gonna be expensive. In September you have a wonderful weather that you can enjoy plenty the square. Restaurants around are, of course, very expensive, so plan ahead your visit with a gelatto or a coffee before get there."

Trust me. You can't really miss it because there is always a queue out the door but it goes down quickly.

Great place to just stroll and take it all in. Can be crowded at times, but again, this is Rome! I have been here so many times I have lost count. In addition, I have picked up some very beautiful, and reasonably priced art from local artists. In case you are thirsty, there are real drinking water fountains at either end (for example, near the fountain of Neptune). These fountains are a really welcomed on a hot Roman summer day. The water is clean, crystal clear, cool, and quenches your thirst. The oval shape of the piazza reveals the original use (a circus during Roman times). The palaces (now hotels, etc.) sprung up around this shape. The fountains are wonderful, especially the one of the Four Rivers. They came after the buildings. Evenings here are very special with street artists and performers. I would avoid any of the restaurants around the Piazza for obvious reasons (expense). However, if you are going to splurge, have a tartufo gelato at Tre Scalini (featured in the NY Times). It really is good. If you go around the corner (the corner opposite the Neptune fountain-sorry I cannot remember the name of the street), you can see where the \"original\" Rome was - about 40 feet below the level of the current street. This area is now open for visitation, but there is a charge. Children are free. Piazza Navona is, and will remain one of my favorite places in Rome. It is also very close to other site, such as the Basilica of San Andrea di Valle, and near a great place for a great salad, I'Insalata Ricca."

I found it very atmospheric and to me it encapsulated the romance of Rome. It was lovely just to sit and watch the world go by, then stroll round and look at the beautiful fountains. Plenty of artists and performers, as at most tourist attractions in the city. A visit to the Church of St. Agnes in Agone is also a must. The narrow streets surrounding the Piazza are very interesting, especially the shops selling beautiful church vestments."

I had only a full day in Rome and I managed to go through the essentials on foot in Rome: http://wp.me/p5Lw9a-2 ...If you have a few more days in the city, I would definitely recommend you to purchase a Roma Pass. It gives you free access to many local museums and it saves you time looking for queues and lining in it. Leaving the Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica, I saw the Castel Sant\u2019 Angelo \u2013 again, the final stage of the book Angels and Demons. I just took a few pictures of the exterior and walked through the Ponte Sant\u2019 Angelo across the Tevere River. Piazza Navona is only 15 minutes away. In the centre of the Piazza was the Fountain of the four Rivers with Egyptian obelisk (yet another key location of the story Angels and Demons), and I enjoyed some snacks and a cup of coffee in the nearby cafes and walked around the shops......"

            "review": "Domitian's Stadium. I was supposed to make my way to Castel Sant\u2019 Angelo (Hadrian\u2019s Tomb) and I did eventually. I took a wrong turn somewhere in Rome\u2019s little alley like streets and ended up in Piazza Navona. Despite the warnings about the crowds in this Piazza, I got lucky, because the day I stumbled on it, it was almost empty. What an absolute gift for someone who enjoys photography. Piazza Navona is built on the site of the first century Stadium of Domitian, hence the oblong shape. This was an athletics and games venue rather than another blood soaked arena. During the medieval period the square was a market, the market was moved by Pope Innocent X when he decided to beautify the square he upset many traders in the process.The Palazzo Pamphili, which lines half of one side of the piazza was Pope Innocent X\u2019s family residence, now it is the Brazilian Embassy and has been so since the 1920s. Around the edges are many cafes. On the opposite side of the piazza to Palazzo Pamphili is the Innocent X sponsored Chiesa Sant \u2018Agnese in Agone, which is an imposing Baroque Church. Unfortunately the day I visited it was closed, more than likely for the lunch break.Along the north/south meridian are 3 fountains, one at either end and one in the middle. The oldest fountain in the piazza, Fontana del Nettuno, is situated at the northern (Vatican end). Originally, only the basin existed of this fountain as it was the neighbourhood supply of water for drinking and washing, as house plumbing became available, public fountains for this purpose were no longer required. The Italian way to beautify something that is practical but has outlived its purpose like this fountain, is to add an amazing statue or 2 or 3, more often of mythical gods or creatures and create a work of art. Fontana del Nettuno was created over a 300 year period from the 1570s, so therefore the statues were carved by different artists. The fountain takes its name from Neptune in the centre wrestling an octopus; he\u2019s surrounded by sea horses, merpeople and cherubs.At the southern end is Fontana del Moro \u2013 the basin and the statue of the Moor at the centre of the fountain were designed by Bernini, the four tritons added a couple of hundred years later to create visual balance with Fontana del Nettuno.The last fountain to be added to the piazza was Fontana del Quattro Fiume which is a very large fountain in the middle of the Piazza. Designed by Bernini and sponsored by Pope Innocent X, it was unveiled in 1651; apparently it was very unlike other fountains already in existence in Rome. This fountain has many allegory and metaphors contained within its four larger than life river gods, who represented the major rivers on the four known continents. \u2022 The Danube representing Europe. The largest European river nearest to Rome, hence why the Pope\u2019s personal coat of arms touch the river god.\u2022 The Nile represented Africa; this river god has his head covered indicating that the scholars hadn\u2019t yet found the source of the Nile.\u2022 The Ganges represents the Asian continent, has an oar, indicating that it was possible to navigate the river.\u2022 The Rio de la Plata river god sits on a pile of coins indicating the riches that came to Europe from the Americas.The statues semi recline on chunks of marble, which are built up in the centre to create a platform for an obelisk to rest on. Rising from the centre of the fountain, the obelisk is topped with the Pamphili dove of peace. The underside of the obelisk platform creates a grotto. The sculptures on this incredible fountain were all completed by different artists but create an integrated scene. Take your time to walk around the fountain and really observe what\u2019s in front of you; the fountain is so much more than just the river gods. Stop and listen to the melody of the flowing water and let its sound sooth you.The day I visited the piazza a terrific jazz band were playing, there were a couple of other street entertainers including a very interesting \u201cfaceless man\u201d who was quite comical, an Indian \u201cmeditating man\u201d who was very much interested in encouraging people\u2019s donations, artists; some who could do a fabulous portrait in about 15 minutes, others specialised in various themes.If Piazza Navona looks familiar maybe it's because it featured in the movie Angels and Demons.What I found interesting is yes, it has 3 fountains, all with different themes, sculpted by different artists, yes, they\u2019re amazing but for all the hype I enjoyed other Piazzas in Rome more."

The main landmarks here are the famous fountain of four rivers in the center, the two lesser fountains at either ends, and the Church of St. Agnes. Unfortunately we could not enter the church as it was closed. (Many churches in Rome closes from 12Noon to 3pm). The piazza is surrounded by many restaurants which are full of people enjoying food and drink sitting outside. For me personally it is a bit too crowded, though the setting was charming."

This popular square is laid out on the ruins of an arena built in AD86 which seated 33,000 people to watch the athletic contests that took place here. It then operated as the city's main market for 300 years after the 15th century. It is filled with baroque palazzi, extravagant fountains, pavement cafes, and crowds of people. The famous Bernini Fountain of the Four Rivers dominates the centre of the square, depicting the Nile, Ganges, Danube and Plate - the only known continents at that time. The Nile's veiled head indicates the unknown source of this river at the time. The fountain is decorated with a palm tree, lion, horse and on obelisk on the top. The other 2 fountains date from the 16th century but have been altered several times since then. At the northern end of the piazza is the Neptune Fountain built in 1576 but the statues of Neptune and the Nereids date from the 19th century. At the southern end is the Moro Fountain to which Bernini added the statue of a Moor fighting a dolphin. The various seasons bring in the street entertainers and the stalls selling toys and sweets. The piazza, up until the 19th century, used to be filled with water in August by stopping the fountain outlets and the rich would ride around in carriages with street urchins splashing after them."

I can't recommend eating at the restaurants directly around the plazza but if you wonder beyond, a couple of blocks down the small winding streets, you will find numerous small local restaurants that are great eating for reasonable prices. My wife and I used this location as our point of reference for locating great eats in the neighborhood. I'd recommend Osteria dell Anima and Antica Taverna for lunch or dinner."

I liked the peaceful atmosphere of the square in the morning, with a lot of birds arround, disturbed only by the first artists coming and preparing their instruments for drawing / painting or singing. Slowly the market was filled with tourists eager to capture in photography the beauty of church architecture, the statue monuments, the Fantines. But Piazza belongs primarily to the children, who enjoy the peace and beauty of this wonderful place! Children make this place so Happy!!!"

On a bright and sunny winter day (where the temperatures crept up to around 14 C (close to 60 F)) this is still the place to be.Granted, that many of the restaurants and caf\u00e9's has less outside serving place than closer to spring, but the absolutely wonderful thing about Rome (and Italy in general) is that as soon as the sun is out, everybody flocks to the outside serving areas to bask in the sun and enjoy a drink or lunch outside.Piazza Navona is no exception - and the place - a converted horse track from roman time is a beautiful place, with one of the best-known fountains in Rome - the Fountain of the Four Rivers by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Which of the four statues is which river, I'll leave to you to decide.The two lesser known fountains is at the southern end; Fontana del Moro with a basin and four Tritons sculpted by Giacomo della Porta and at the northern end is the Fountain of Neptune also created by Giacomo della Porta.The usual crowd of street salesmen, buskers, more or less talented street performers is always present - so you can stay entertained for hours. In the small streets leading away from Piazza Navona is a wonderful collection of touristy shops and the Roman everyday stores.Even when you walk the streets in the most touristy areas, normal people lives here - which makes Rome such a wonderful place to visit.Highly recommendable!!"

While I was imagining Andrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck on a scooter/vespa fast ride through Rome from movie \"Holiday in Rome\", I found myself at Piazza Navona. Its four fountains, surrounded by beautiful churches and palaces, are considered great works of art. Beauty and richness of baroque opened in front of my eyes. This lovely square is very Roman place - the life swells here. La Fontana dei Quattro Fiume, made by a famous artist Bernini, is situated in the center of the Piazza.This fountain is made of four fabulous sculptures symbolizing four rivers - the Danube, the Nile, the Ganges and the Rio de la Plata and of a grand Egyptian obelisk. The powerful sculptures in motion, full of dynamics and emotions, make some kind of drama for spectators. You have feeling as if you are watching a theatrical performance. Obviously, Bernini has given something of his passion to his sculptures. The liveliness of the sculptures that belong to all fountains at the square, bring into action space around them, and at the same time, create harmony with the water. The water animates and decorates the sculptures. Some of fountains have allegorical meanings, some of them have mythological devotion. I have admired all these adorable fountains with undisguised pleasure. While I was sitting at cafe at Piazza Navona and was watching tourists passing by and taking photos around fountains, I could see anyone wasn't like Andrey Hepburn or Gregory Peck, or close enough them. Maybe, someone of today's celebrities will appear at the Piazza Navona during your stay.So, take a seat at nearby cafe, order a capuccino, pretend as if you are laid-back Italians, and give way to your feelings of dolce vita!"

But what makes the Navonna so special is that there are side streets bleeding off of every corner of the Piazza, each taking you in the direction of different neighborhoods. The family nightlife of the Navonna is welcoming and second only to the after hours scenes at the multitude of restaurants and bars on the side streets just to the west of the Navonna. No better place to mingle with post college graduate Romans after hours."

From people singing just to sing, to seeing marriage proposals in the Piazza, it was a great place to just sit and relax, people watch, and enjoy the city of life that is Rome. There's a nice little shop a stones throw away that sells pasta, sauces, cheeses, and limoncello. Stop in there to pick up a few things and just sit and enjoy the piazza. The one thing I will not recommend, however, is having a meal there. The restaurants have very tourist-centric menus with very tourist-centric prices. You can walk 10 minutes away and get a lot more for a lot less."

You will never find a Roman in these touristy haunts where the drinks are overpriced and the food, including the pizza, (yes, the pizza) is often frozen.

The fountains are the center piece with the artists, buskers, and vendors providing a garnishing accent. No matter how crowded, there is always an air of joy and celebration. A restful end to the day's activities is dinner at one of the open air restaurants in or around the piazza."

There is a beautiful cathedral that rings it's bell and it is as if time stands still. It is very popular with tourists so get used to crowds but this does not deter from the uniqueness of this piazza. If money is not an object eat on the square. We found a wonderful restaurant one block off the square and there are many to choose. One tip I should mention is all the vendors that aggressively peddle their items ( some cheep and annoying, some interesting) as a part of the experience. I recommend you take in the beauty instead . Enjoy your visit!"

The fountain is beautiful and the sound of the water in the background of everything adds to the ambiance. There is a huge beautiful building on one side of the piazza and on the opposite there are balconies filled with flowers. There are food stands everywhere and street vendors lined up selling just about everything. The merry-go-round played italian music and there was a musical group that I stood and listened to for at least 45 minutes, they played mostly war songs but in a very unique, italian, jazzy kind of style. All in all, a really FUN place."

It is a great masterpiece of Baroque architecture. It is famous because of its three fountains and cafes, night clubs and restaurants around it. Its elegance is further enhanced by some of the monumental buildings especially Church of Sant' Agnese in Agone. I am sure that the sweet memories of the lovely sights of lively square will last long in your mind. To get the real feeling of its liveliness, sit in an open air caf\u00e9 and order something of your taste. Enjoy the music played by the musicians, look at the beautiful flowing water in the fountains, witness the sketches drawn by the painters, listen the stories narrated by the fortune tellers. Move slowly from one fountain to another by looking at the grandeur of the buildings around it. Take photos in front of fountains. The street performers will attract you to stay there as long as possible. I reckon this place as \"Never Miss in Rome\"."

An elongated oval-shaped public square with three fountains - the most famous being Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi - the fountain of the four rivers which was completed in 1651 and designed by Bernini. The rivers represented are The Nile, Ganges, Danube and Rio de la Plata. The Neptune Fountain was designed by Giacomo della Porta and built in 1576 with further statues of Neptune and sea nymphs added in the 19th Century. The Fontana del Moro was also created by della Porta with the central statue designed by Bernini in the 17th Century. The Tritons (male mermaids) were added in 19th century. These fountains are so beautiful at night or at sunrise for photo opportunities when there are less people in the square."

Two squares rich in history , where the markets have come and gone , previously allocated to the Capitol. In fact, in 1478 the markets were moved to Piazza Navona and in 1869 to Campo de ' Fiori. Parione : a term derived from the Latin paries , wall , belonging to the outer fences of the Stadium of Domitian , or the ruins of Templum Olovitreum (quoted in Mirabiliae Urbis Romae 1500, still preserved in the Library of Archaeology and History of Art in Rome ) , a very high building rich in mosaics , gold and crystals, the residence of the Prefect of the City. In the Middle Ages the ruins were used as a basis for the towers and is remembered here the Parione Tower. Via dei Cappellari , Chiavari, Canestrari , Baullari , Leutari , Balestrari : they are all ways that bear the names linked to the job or the destination ( because of Granari ) . Campo de ' Fiori is just famous for the variety of flowers that were exposed . Area of the Orsini , with the market trading develops quickly and one of the inns here was run by Vannozza Cattanei , mother of Caesar, Lucrezia, Juan and Jose Borgias, in via del Gallo n.11 .But this area was also gruesome. Here, in Campo dei fiori happened the burning of Giordano Bruno in 1600. The statue by Ettore Ferrari ( 1889) reminds us . In the same spot where now stands the statue there 'was a fountain with a cover that looked like a bowl and was called \" the terrine .\" This fountain is today in front of the New Church since 1924. On its cover there is an inscription: \"Love God and do not fail , makes good and not fail.\" Under the building Orsini - Righetti in 1864 , was found a statue of Hercules, now on display in the Vatican Museums . The presence in the area of Ancient Theatre of Pompey (the first in masonry, 61 BC, with a diameter of 150m auditorium with capacity for 20,000 spectators ) , on which they built palaces , it makes the whole thing fascinating . Right here in the temporary Senate Curia, in March 15, 44a.C. Julius Caesar was assassinated . Walking through via della Cancelleria we encounter a Renaissance palace block in travertine (taken from the Colosseum and the Theatre of Pompey ) built by Cardinal Raffaele Riario ( nephew of Pope Sixtus IV Della Rovere) in 1483 . This palace was the seat of the Apostolic Chancery , here was signed the surrender to Charles V , here was the seat of the Tribunal of the Roman Republic of 1798 and we are always here was the seat of the Imperial Court of Napoleon in 1810. Then , in 1848 it was the seat of the Chamber of Deputies of the Papal States . Currently it is the seat of the Roman Rota and the Apostolic Signatura ."

Yes, for much of the day, it is crowded with visitors and full of bored vendors and street artists trying to pocket a few euros from tourists. But try being there at about six in the morning and you can have the perfect romantic experience and privilege of being the only visitors in Rome's most beautiful piazza. Then you can see - without gawping tourists, bored vendors, beggars and inadequate portrait artists - the astonishing beauty of the Bernini Fountain of the Four Rivers and the other impressive sights. If you wish to sit outside a bar to watch the world go by, be aware. By law, bars must display a list of prices but these apply only to those drinking (and standing) at the bar. If you drink outside, the price is what the waiter (and/or owner) wants it to be. Our advice is to do what the Romans do - go to one of the many small and much cheaper bars in the narrow streets around the piazza. Doing this also means that you get way from the hordes of tourists who too often seem to do little more than take photographs or videos of their friends and families."

The piazza is dominated by a fantastic fountain complete with Roman gods, sea nymphs, and sea monsters. You could spend an hour gazing at the sculptures which adorn the fountain. But save time to enjoy lunch or dinner at one of the many cafes that surround the piazza. Stroll around the entire square and just soak up \"Italy.\" This is a Roman experience not to miss."

At Piazza Navona you'll be able to not only witness the marvelous work of Miguel Angel in a tremendous fountain and church, but you'll be able to enjoy a wonderful meal listening to some of the most traditional italian songs played live, its a bit expensive to eat at one of the many restaurants in front of it, but if you have some extra bucks it's definitely a great experience! Plus you can visit de Museo di Roma which is right in front and holds amazing art, overall, Piazza Navona holds the whole package for tasteful travelers."

While enjoying the sites of Piazza Navona (the fountains, the street perfomers, and the churches) we approached one of the few remaining artists in the piazza. His name was Sergio and his work was amazing. There are very few artists left in the piazza, and Sergio's story was so colorful and, dare I say it, Italian? Lost loves, celebrity encounters, and far-away children. He was such a sweet man! Gave my friend a great price on one of his oil paintings (which, again, was spectactular), and we even got pictures with him. Best way to experience the culture of Rome (that's slowly disappearing thanks to globalization) is to talk with the locals! You'll never forget it!"

There are 3 fountains placed distance apart from each other throughout the stretch of thesquare. Unfortunately the Fountain of Four Rivers at the center which had Ganges as one of the representative rivers was under repair so could not get a full view of it. I personally loved the wonderful sculpture of the fountain of Neptune ( the other one wad fountain of moor on the other end of the square) which dated back to the 16th century and was looking great with lights coming out of the water below it. The entire square is lit in yellowish halogens which created an amazing effect with the tourist crowd all around. The entire place is lined with open air dining restaurants and bars along one side and add to that the wonderful display of arts throughout the square where locals are singing, putting up their picture arts for display and sale and also drawing live portraits, every bit of which contributes to the wonderful ambiance created in the atmosphere here."

But when my girlfriend and I got there at around 6:30 in the evening it really showed off just how charming a Piazza it is.3 beautiful fountains that had been delicately created hundreds of years ago, the street performers and the general atmosphere you enter when you get there quickly turned it into one of my favourite places in the city.There was one street performer in particular that had us hooked, a clown in a mustard coloured suit who insisted with spraying a square around him where people could stand had us entertained for the best part of 45 minutes.Great fun and a great place to visit. You really don't have to be a historian or an architect to truly appreciate this.Lots of people advise to be wary of pickpockets here, we personally didn't see any instances but it's not worth running the risk. Keep your items close and you will be fine."

Above all the central one, with the architect Bernini's 1650 a.c. figurative depiction of the main rivers then known, is something huge and astonishing, to watch very carefully and enjoy with calm, preferably with a good guide to read about it with you.Obviously, as every main touristic attraction is really crowdy, messy and full of every kind of peddlers, so be careful about your wallet and above all be prepared to be offered every kind of portrait, ring neck, fluo bracelet, etc..

It covers exactly the area occupied by the track of Rome's first stadium, also known as Circus Agonalis (competition arena), pronounced as \"n'Agona\" and later \"Navona\".Piazza Navona is one of my favorite squares in Rome. It is a pedestrian square where no cars are allowed, but above all a square where you can enjoy and admire the beautiful Fountain of the Four Rivers of Bernini and the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone by Borromini. The atmosphere at this historical square is great. I walk around the square to see the two other beautiful fountains, the Moor fountain at the south and the Neptune fountain at the north end of the square. Then I take a seat on one of the terraces for a coffee and watch this Italian treasure. There are painters, street performers and musicians and many tourists that keep this square as lively as it is and as it always has been. The square is a miracle in the heart of Rome!"

Be careful of the pick-picketers and the nighttime scam artists.....you have been warned. But don't let this scare you off. This palazzo is a must especially at night; take a stroll by the cathedral and look up into the lit grand ballroom to see the absolutely beautiful tromp l'oeil ceiling glimmering."

Some street vendors around which does spoil the area - one selling balloons which would have interrupted everyone's photos and cheapens the place - unfortunately this seems to be something the authorities don't want to curb.

We were lucky to be there on a warm, sunny afternoon with a cool breeze, and we spent about an hour just taking in the scenery, people watching, browsing the art, and enjoying gelato.There is a bus that goes straight there; the stop is Vittorio Emmanuele/Piazza Navona. I would recommend taking the bus there and meandering back towards the Fontana del Tritone (at the Barberini metro stop, A line), during which time you'll pass the Pantheon, Tempio Adriano, Fontana di Trevi, as well as the Via del Corso (similar to Champs-Elyssees in Paris with tons of high end shopping and eateries).Piazza Navona was a great place to relax and enjoy the Roman atmosphere."

The square has additional two fountains, the 'Fontana del Moro' and the 'Fountain of Neptune'. The artwork and the sculptures are so very real specially when you see the work on the fountain at South End where one sees a Moor wrestling with a Dolphin and the basin with the four Tritons.One can also not miss the ancient speaking statue of 'Pasquino' at the southern end of the PiazzaThe evenings are so beautiful to spend in the Piazza and one can see painters doing water/oil colurs and artisans doing performing art. There are very good restaurants on the side where one can sip red wine and eat a nice Italian meal and look on to the happenings in the Plaza. It is said that in the past history, theatrical events were held here as also the Bazzars and during christmas the sight would be enthreal.We had quite a few enchanting and memorable evenings at the Piazza Navona."

This is a gorgeous piazza that is filled with hustle and bustle of tourists but at the same time chilled out with people sitting back in the caf\u00e9s just watching the world go by! You can have food or just a drink in one of the many restaurants and cafe bars or even just sit on one of the seats and take it all in. It has fountains and either end which are lovely with lots in between. Well worth a visit!!"

The shape of buildings, the obelisks and fountains, this is a time travelers dream of a place. While I only shopped at a toy store in the square, it seems like aperfect place, too, for a more modern experience of buying presents to take back to friends and family."

We visited this ancient place dating from the Middle Ages in late afternoon when there were so many things going on: artists using chalk and spray paint, portrait and caricature artists, jewelry artists and vendors, music performers, soccer ball antic performers, mimes, etc. Lots of people, some eating, some people-watching, some watching performers, some dining in front of restaurants but all engaged in some way. A very interesting gathering place with three wonderful sculpture fountains built over the Emperor Domitian's stadium: Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers in the center, Bernini's Fountain of the Moor at the south end and a 19th century Fountain of Neptune at the other end. Be sure to visit this activity packed beautiful baroque site."

Even if you are in Rome only for a few days do take out the time to visit the Piazza Navona.Its a large and rectangular Piazza with three fountains and beautiful statuary. In the centre is the Fountain of the Four rivers with an Egyptian obelisk.We visited the Piazza in the evening and everything shone burnished gold. The atmosphere sparkled too. There were impromptu musicians, a wonderfully theatrical magician, delicate paintings in stalls and artists at work. You could get your portrait or even a caricature made on the spot, share a bench with strangers or just drift from one end of the square to the other admiring the splendid buildings around.Piazza Navona is definitely among my Top 5 outdoor attractions in a city where its very difficult to pick favourites!"

Each side is different & tells a story if you do the research/learn the history in its carving. The piazza is oblong & surrounded by buildings, so it feels more tight/small compared to other piazzas. There are other, less ornate details + fountains in the piazza but it felt safe and was relatively clean. Plus, it was centrally located in Rome."

This place is simply fabulous.Some people are turned off by all the honky tonk, but we love it. The tourists, the performers, the artists, the purse sellers, the cops, and the waiters all add to the charm of the place. Plus there are the three Bernini fountains and the buildings.This trip we enjoyed spending time at one of the cafes (avoid Tre Scalini -- Rome's answer to Antoine's in New Orleans, an over-rated restaurant living on past reviews) and just watching the going's on. We particularly enjoyed the purse sellers, who scatter (well, grab their bags and walk about 10 feet away) whenever a police car enters the piazza, and the interactions between the various performers.Whether you're interested in the architecture or the nonstop showtime, it's a fascinating place."

There was a woman playing the accordion to the left ,So the whole thing made my lunch of rigatoni amatricaina very special even tho it was just pasta . The starter of fior di zucchini and bacala fritti was good , the spino Peroni was great and the coffee was spot on. The price tag of \u20ac 83 without a tip was expected , but this is a case of paying for the location , which I'm ok with as this is certainly a stunning place to be and to eat at . The only down side to the restaurant was the loos which were in the basement, unisex and attended by an elderly lady with a sign that said. \"Your tips are my wages\" ... Why? They charge enough upstairs to pay for someone to check there is paper and soap , which is all she did .."

Our guide gave us a detailed history, but due it being a tour sadly we didn't really get a chance to \"enjoy\" our visit. Built originally as the Stadium of Domitian, this has \"become\" what you now see as the piazza. There are three fountains, the Fountain of Neptune, the Moor Fountain, which is a replica, due to a vandal (who would have thought, a vandal in Rome!) the original is now housed in the Gallery Borghese, and the Fountain of the Four Rivers (complete with the obelisk of Domitian). The piazza also contains the Sant'Agnese in Agone (again, sadly we didn't get a chance to view inside).Apart from these obvious sights, there are plenty of cafes, an art market, shops and the general hustle and bustle of a lovely place. I think it would merit more than one visit, sadly due to time constraints we didn't get the chance to go back, but on our next trip to Rome we definitely will..!!"

It is a circle of life, from the tourists to the natives trying to sell trinkets. Food, attractions, everything. There is nothing like Rome. It is like taking a step back into the History books, you can almost hear the roar in the coliseum as the gladiators entertain. I had an apartment rented for 1 week off of the Piazza Navona and my family and I believed it was the best place. It felt like the epicenter of everything happening. Night time it transforms into just more attractions, and there is never a dull moment. Easy access to the rest of the city, cabs are readily available, and the people are very nice. My favorite memory was the guy who served me delicious fresh gelato with berries and sang to me. I think I need to go back and find him..."

We never had any problems even with pickpockets but that may have been because we were aware and followed the usual safety precautions such as wear a money belt and never take anything out that we could not afforded to lose, as well as avoiding anyone wanting to get too close and groups of people showing interest in others. But we did this in every other city and country and would do the same in home cities.

Piazza Navona however is just a great place filled with beautiful fountains, shops and many good restaurants. I have been here 2 times and just love the atmosphere, both day and night. In ancient times it actually served as an oval outdoor arena for racing and athletic events. You get a sense of that by looking at the layout.

As expertly informed by my wife....?If your lucky enough to be in Roma from November to Xmas, the pizza is a wonderful craft market and children's rides, Italians do Xmas very well.Whilst in the area, you must visit the Campo di fiori, or flower market by day, with lovely restaurants, and by night another source of great entertainment.For you assassins creed players, see the statue in the campo...

The hardest decision was working out whether to sit in the sunshine to eat or go across the square to sit on the shady side. The menus are all much of a muchness so we ended up just picking the most pitiable looking waiter, an older white haired guy. The food was OK but he turned out to be not so pitiful after all after he pushed his accordion cd into our hands as a thank you for choosing his table, and then charged us for it on the bill! Oh well. Made a decent souvenir from our holiday to one of the family back home!"

We visited during the afternoon and it was busy but not too busy to stop us walking around or to stop us taking photos. It's a nice place to walk around to take in the detail on the fountains and admire the buildings and church. There are also plenty of restaurants in this Piazza, although we didn't eat here as had more sightseeing to do!"

Gaze on the spectacle of Bernini's Fontana deir Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers), grab a gelato and wander around amidst the sidewalk artists at work, marvel at the Baroque pallazi that line it, pause for an espresso. When you've had enough of the passing parade and feel the need for food, detour up one of the small alleys that run off the piazza and you'll find an endless array of places to eat that are charming and (as is the case throughout Italy) cheaper than on the piazza itself. You are also within walking distance of other attractions such as the Pantheon and Largo di Torre Argentina (take your time and stop for more espresso and gelato along the way)."

It is really quite something! It is a nice area with cafes nearby, whether just for lunch, a coffee, or a drink - again, I don't recommend passing on the Trevi Fountain, but you can take your time here (at Piazza Navona) without feeling so rushed to get out of the way for all the other tourists."

Certainly the fountain is still as magnificent as always and the chocolate ice cream probably is also, but the experience in the Piazza with crowds of people, those who weren't jamming the Trevi Fountain, and stalls filled with tourist items for sale left me with sadness that the world has changed. If the visit is your first time, be sure to go and perhaps take the advice of the other reviewers and do it at night when it's not so crowded. If you are returning, as I was, be prepared for what has become an ordinary tourist site with an exquisite fountain in the middle. And that alone warrants a visit."

Opposite of the main fountain is Sant' Agnese in Agone church, which boasts a stunning facade by Borromini. Again, another great architectural design, which are so common in Rome. The Fountain of the Four Rivers, which is one of the main attractions here, is stunning - but I mean, what fountain in Rome isn't? Luckily for me, I visited Piazza Navona with a friend who is a local guide, and she explained the history of this beautiful work of art by Bernini. The Fountain depicts the Gods of four rivers in the four continents recognized (back then) by Renaissance geographers: the Nile in Africa, the Ganges in Asia, the Danube in Europe and the R\u00edo de la Plata in America. For each country, Bernini included animals and plants pertaining to each. For example, for the Ganges, you will see an oar (representing how the river was easy to navigate), the Nile is shown with a piece of cloth covering its head (because no one knew where it was located), the Danube shows the Papal coat of arms and the Rio is shown on a pile of coins, which was a symbol of how rich America was (and this depicted the hope that American might offer Europe some of those riches).It really is a masterpiece."

It has a couple of beautiful fountains that for me were part of my growth as a child. Every time I go to Rome I will spent sometime there just to remember that and enjoy the architecture and the ambience of the area (specially at night).As a tourist, besides the history of the place, there is not much to see. Yes, its Rome so everything its interesting but, besides the fountains, you would not see something special. A lot of people gets disappointed here, mostly, because they don't know what to expect. Its just a square, good environment, a couple of things to see and a place to move on. Nothing more, nothing less. Take the pictures and enjoy the moment."

But always be aware of the gypsy pick pocketers. They can be disguised as tourists, mothers with babies or even priests. Sadly there seems to be an epidemic. But don't let this put you off, just be extra careful and if you sense someone hovering uncomfortably close or trying to distract you be extra careful. Often they are young women working in pairs."

Worth a visit to just see the fountains.It is long and narrow because the buildings are built over the grandstands of a circus (race track) built by Emporer Domitian. Part of the original structure is visible in the northwest corner. Some street performers and musicans are very good and others pretty hokey,Hint: At least one or two of the restaurants are famous for their gelato. If you sit at a table, expect 6 to 10\u20ac. You can also walk inside and order at the counter for 2-4 \u20ac and eat it sitting by a fountain. Although reasonably safe, watch your stuff. There was some type of a scuffle near me with someone apparently trying to run off with a vendors money or merchandise. The police seem to be always around, even daytime. Personally, I liked the smaller Campo de Fiori, which is closeby."

Such beauty of the fountains, so much life taking place around it with happy tourists (and sadly too many garbage-souvenir pushers . . . who aren't even Italian . . . and the stuff they are selling is just junk) bustling around. Do (quietly, as in do not talk) visit the Church of Sant Agnese in the center of the Piazza, it is utterly gorgeous. Mass may be taking place, so it is more important to be quiet during Mass. We ate at Tre Scalini and it was amazing! Can't wait to return and just sit and sip a glass of wine while watching people and the day go by in Rome!"

The Piazza showcases the 4 Rivers Fountain or what they call the \"Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi\" designed by Bernini, the Obelisk and the Sant Agnese church. But these are not the only attractions in the area. One will find that the square is streaming with artists selling their craft, or maybe, one would rather have himself/herself sketched. You can also see lots of cafe and, another must if I may say so, the tasty home made gelatos (ice cream). When at the Piazza, just relax and enjoy the scenery while eating gelato.

Many restaurants- pricey and touristic, though I've not eaten in one personally, nothing really caught my eye. There are gelato places- Grom being one of them, the other is \"Tre Scalini\" where you can eat the famous Tartufo dessert, people swear it's the best. Plenty of street vendors selling their paintings, it's a place not to miss. I've been several times and although it is very busy with tourists stopping to see the main fountain- \"Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi\" there are also many locals that sit on the benches and people watch on the weekends. So grab a gelato, people watch and take in the beauty of the fountain that dates back to the late 1500's! I've visited Rome several different times in the past 5 years and each time I can say I'm equally surprised to see this amazing fountain...."

We experienced an incredibly large number of tour groups that tended to block the narrow streets in the historic center and hallways in the museums. Piazza Navona is very large and can accommodate a large crowd without feeling crowded. You can hang out and escape the crowded city. Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers is just one reason to visit. The piazza is surrounded by nice cafes. The real secret is that just off the south end of the piazza, between the piazza and Vittorio Emmanuel II, are a number of narrow streets with lots of bars, cafes, bistros and osterias."

With the Statue of the Four Rivers in the center, and the Fountain of Neptune and the Fountain del Moro on either end and the gorgeous Church of St. Agnes in Agony entered from the center as well. Come here to relax, people watch, and just take it all in.... A masterful example of Baroque architecture, you should definitely make a point of visiting this wonderful piazza."

But is really worth finding, as it is a lovely typically Italian Piazza, with the stunning fountains and lovely churches. We saw it in the morning, and the on another day in the afternoon. I would recommend going in the moring, as it is much quieter, and the pesky crap sellers are not about in the mornings!There are cafes around the square, street artists and musicians. Lovely atmosphere. (if you want to see an amazing street artist, outside the mcDonalds between Trevi fountain and I think the Pantheon there is a girl who does great paintings with spray cans.

The piazza itself is very worth seeing with lots of activity to keep you interested. However, the real fun is the fountain itself. My wife read the kids a story of the fountain out of a travel book which really brought the fountain to life. We spent a lot of time with the kids looking for various features and asking them what they thought of them. It was a nice way to start the trip in Rome. I'd definitely recommend finding some time to stop by when you visit the city. If you can spend some time looking into the history as it makes a much richer experience."

Collectively, they represent four major rivers of the four continents through which papal authority had spread: the Nile representing Africa, the Danube representing Europe, the Ganges representing Asia, and the R\u00edo de la Plata representing the Americas.The Piazza was bustling with Life with painters and Tourist. Dining by the restaurants in the evening was a romantic pleasure as the Piazza quietens after Sunset and the Fountain lights lit the Piazza to a different atmosphere.

It is built on the site of Stadium of Domitian that draws its beginnings from 1st century AD. Sometime the ancient Romans, the citizens of the capital of Roman Empire, came here to watch the agones ( \"games\"). If You look more attentively at the forme of this square, You will see that it has the shape of the open space of the stadium, little bit elliptical. Around the square, there are the very nice buildings with the restaurants and shops at their ground level. In the centre there are the wonderful fountains with some gods sitting on the rock, between the streams of waters, emerging off the holes in the stone body. By the passing of the times, the name agones evolved in avones and then in navone.Surface under the feet is of the cobblestones. The buildings that line along the perimeter of the square, are the significant example of Baroque Roman architecture and art. The fountain, that I just mentioned, is called the Fountain of the Four Rivers (Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi).And these rivers are: the Danube, the Ganges, the Nile and the Rio de la Plata. Above the fountain,raises the Egyptian obelisk. At the other side of the square is Fontana del Moro, representing four Tritons and subsequently added the statue of a Moor or African,wrestling with a dolphin. One more fountain located on the northern side is the Fontana di Neptune. Also the very interesting is the ancient 'speaking' statue of Pasquino, erected in 1501. Here Romans could leave lampoons or derogatory social commentary attached to the statue.Here are held the theatrical events and performances of the artists, that with the open market is what gives the square some kind of vivacity,very cheerfully received by the locals and tourists."

There is a large fountain in the centre with a smaller one at each end of the rectangular square as well as the normal bevy of eateries etc.Visiting on Sunday afternoon was the most enjoyable due to the 'market environment' bustling with artists and those peddling images of local scenes as well as those offering caracitures.I would certainly have made a purchase or two of the local scenes if only i had any possible way to transport them home."

When I read about this place, I thought it will be one of the many fountains and piazzas this magical city has, but, I was wrong when I just got dropped in middle of it from a side street and evening was just about to wake up.Yes, this place has best mood in evening and it is different in day time. If you want to make a promise to love one's sitting while sitting on bench with tiny showers on you from fountain and if you want to enjoy the statue with aqua colours underneath and open sky within your eyes reach and if you want to amuse yourself with variety of art scattered every where on canvas and slight tunes played by any street player to collect few coins, then this is the place.In north and west you cross the streets and enter in to narrow cobbled streets with cafes and in south and east you enter back to Pantheon and Senate buildings or in High Street with hustle bustle, but, while you are in this Piazza, you can make your own mood to enjoy smoothness away from town noise.Must go and feel place to make mood ;)"

Important to see is the sculpting in the middle of the square by Bernini and the Church Sant Agnese designed by Boromini. Legend goes that these two did not like these other and hence once the church was made Bernini sculpted his man on the fountain giving an impression that he does not like the church at all (see pic). Piazza Navona is filled with small little gelaterias, pizzerias and cafes. We had a very fine gelato. But beware of the prices at the pizzerias along with the \"service charge\".

But, it's a great Piazza to walk through at any time of day/evening. There are a lot of people (a little less so in the evening), so it's a pretty safe place for a stroll or for some people-watching.We loved the atmosphere/buzz, the architecture, and the fountains. The central area of the piazza is usually filled with people painting or selling merchandise, while the outer edge is comprised of mostly caf\u00e9s, a large church, 1-2 stands for purchasing roasted walnuts and a few small shops. On the neighbouring streets, you'll find more retail and caf\u00e9s/gelaterias (check out Grom!).* One word of caution, however, is that there are some restaurants in and around the piazza that I would suggest not going to. Read the reviews online if you can! We had one experience where, since we were so tired of walking around trying to find a place to eat, we settled on a place on one of the side-streets of the Piazza. We were charged a lot of Euros for a rather sub-par meal. So, just be aware of the prices and look at the food as you walk by people's tables. You'll constantly be approached by the guys waiting at the entrance to seat you - don't let them persuade you into a bad meal!"

From the spectacular Baroque fountains, enticing trattoria, people watching - especially at Christmas, when holiday booths offer unique treasures - it is hard to find another locale that conveys the charms of Rome.After lunch be sure to step inside the stunning church Sant' Agnese in Agone, a jewel of Baroque architecture, dedicated to the martyred young woman who - regardless of the terrible consequences - had the audacity & integrity to resist her father, secular authorities & the Inquisition.

The fountains, the coffee shops, restaurants and all the artisits that sorounds it. The possibility to just stay there and watch people come and go. In winter this plaza turns into a Carnaval, circus, fair... was exciting for the kids but you can not see the plaza at all or, even think of eating there.So if you want to enjoy it I suggest you go after winter. To watch the Fontana del Moro sculpted by Giacomo della Porta (1575) with some additions in1673 by Bernini and the Fountain of Neptune created in 1574 by Giacomo della Porta."

It was opened as a public square and a market place in 15th Century. In the center, there is the famous fountain Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi or Fountain of the Four Rivers (1651) by Bernini. It also has an Egyptian Obelisk brought here most probably by Caligula. The four rivers reprsented in the fountain are \u2013 Nile, Ganges, Danube and Rio de la Plata.One side of the square is dominated by the family palace Palazzo Pamphili of the Pope Innocent (1644-55). Piazza Navona has two additional fountains and they create the perfect harmony for the space. The place is full of tourists. There are shops all around and there is a kind of buzz in the atmosphere. A major attraction of Rome despite being overcrowded most of the times. If you take the Pantheon nearby, the entire area once constituted the historical Campus Martius. All in all, a beautiful square and worth multiple visits."

The two smaller lovely fountains are at both ends of the piazza. There are many cafes and restaurants, and the piazza is an artists marketplace, many paintings are sold with similar landscapes, and there are various entertainment performances, which I wasn't eager about. We had steep-priced coffees here on a morning, but with the view of the grand fountain, it was worth it to do it once! But being very touristy, I wouldn't dine here. If you like it quiet, best to come here in the early morning, there are less sales people too. At night it is very nice with the lights and ambiance, but busier and more street vendors."

Crowded, but mostly with Roman's who visited what used to be enjoying the fantastic eateries along the Piazza, it was a place to dine \"al fresco\", people watch, bask in the sunlight reflecting over the magnificent sculptures and fountains, and feel very much like you were in a \"Fellini\" movie. I was in the entertainment business in those days, and Tres Scalari (I think I have it correct) was the spot for not only the best tortufu in the world, but for fabulous food and delicious roman wine. That was then, but alas not now. The last time we visited, about a year ago, the food in the cafe's along the Piazza were poor quality at best. The tortufo was mediocre, and the prices outlandish. It is a must see for the art, but a real tourist trap, where the only \"Romans\" I saw were beggars, pick-pockets and street performers. There are still a few decent shops along the street here, but you need to haggle. If you want great Italian food, go out to where the people live, not where the tourists congregate. There is still wonderful food to be found in Rome, but not on Piazza Navona. If you travel away, just a bit from the city, almost every restaurant is magical, reasonable and memorable."

Now primarily bringing local artists and entertainers. Many artists do caricature here but be cautious as some are truly good but others are not so great so examine their work and ask if they did them. Its a great place to sit and people watch and right around the corner from the Pantheon. The square is very crowded but its a great place to take a break and the mountains are worth a look. Its an alright place for lunch but probably only if you want to people watch as its loud and over priced with lots of people trying to sell you things (so sit a row or two in)."

It can become crowded so if you're not keen on a high volume of people, then its not for you. In this clean piazza there were many good restaurants and a few lovely shops, stunning architecture and great ambience. If you go behind the piazza, there are winding roads which are dotted with more shops and restaurants, which were less expensive than those in the main piazza. Italian life was abounding there, with people playing chess al fresco and the buzz of excitement all around."

My wife and I were walking back from placing our 25th Anniversary \"Love Lock\" on a bridge over the Tiber and decided to stop at the Piazza Navona for one last Italian dinner before returning home. The serendipitous circumstance of this choice could not have been planned any more perfect! As we entered the piazza the full moon had risen above the buildings and its glow filled the area with an almost tangible romance, reminiscent of a 1950's Hollywood 'chic flick'. We thoroughly enjoyed the dinner, by candle and moonlight al fresco, while watching the people coming and going and the artists busily converting blank canvas to a memory that a passing tourist would hopefully take home. The central fountain and obelisk was a tremendous work of art in its own right and easily rivals any of the many fountains we enjoyed during our stay including Trevi!When it was time to return to our apartment and pack for the trip home we happened upon an artist who had done a piece with a man and woman standing and kissing with the full moon behind them. You guessed it! It came home with us a memory of our time by the full moon in Piazza Navona."

Today, it's a daytime-and-night time scene for performance arts, singers, painters, clothing retailers, food vendors, mimes, tourists and locals, all surrounded by a score of cafes and restaurants. Not a bad seat in the piazza. It's located at the crossroads to and from every worthy ancient site in Rome, and hosts three monumental fountains and Sant' Agnese basilica. Rubes will insist that from the correct angle, one can imagine a statue in Bernini's Fountain of Four Rivers trying to hold back the imminent collapse of the facade of rival Boromini's church. Don't fall for it. Bernini designed his fountain representing the four great rivers of the Medieval world before Boromini completed his church (1651 vs. 1657). Nevertheless, the fountain, church and the high-energy life of Piazza Navona makes this site exciting, fun and stimulating. Not to be missed."

It was previously a location for chariot races in historic Rome (hence the shape) and currently is a center for lical artists. Very beautiful and lively. I wouldnt eat at any of the restaurants there (over priced and not very good) but if you cross the main street to Piazza Cancelleria there are some yummy restaurants and hidden gems for pasta and pizza."

Its such an eclectic mix of shops, ice cream parlours cafes and restaurants around the sides, and spaces to sit and watch the people everywhere in the middle. The fountains are lovely, and the evening is full of market stalls of paintings, other artwork, and some goods. We liked the laid back easy ambiance, except for the lucky lucky men. They hound you with their wares, this time it was a small helicopter device that they fire up in the air using an elastic band, it lights up and spins to the ground. Each one of these sellers moves in your path, and pesters until you firmly state No, at which point they leave to find their next victim. Unfortunately, they are replaced by another, and another. Your desire to quietly sit and watch the world will be broken every few minutes as they try to sell you their goods.Yes we enjoyed the piazza, and returned their again the night after, but the delightful memories of this place have been tainted a little."

You meet many people and tourists from around the world wandering along to enjoy music, artistic works, watching painters or having their portraits, in real or caricature, done. My husband and I had ordinary portraits for 40 euros each. It was a great experience and we enjoyed it. However, be careful from pickpocketing while watching painters. Restaurants serve delicious Italian and international food, but those located at the main square charge higher prices than those on the streets around the piazza. Another advice, try to get a bus map from your hotel. Bus routes cover many of Rome attractions and they are cheaper than taxies."

The plaza was beautiful at night, with the central fountain lit. The narrow streets to the east of the plaza were fun to wander in, and though we never found the restaurant we came for, we landed at the Antica Taverna for dinner and had a wonderful time! The day we left, we had an hour or two to kill, and took the Metro to the Barberini stop and visited the Trevi fountain and Pantheon on our way back to the Piazza Navona, where we caught a bus back to our hotel.

There were plenty of places to sit and take in the atmosphere. There are several restaurants that surround the square. The fountains are spectacular and the area was well kept. There were lots of vendors, but they were not aggressive. However they do take away from the beauty of the piazza."

This was my second visit to this Piazza and it felt as wonderful as it did the first time, even with the swarms of people that I didn't have when visiting in Winter. We arrived at dusk and it was still filled with people. With the warm evening air, we grabbed a table in one of the countless restaurants ringing the piazza, ordered a meal and sat back to people watch. It is filled with a vibrancy and a sense of relaxation that simply can't be described, but is definitely somewhere you should take some extra time to just sit back and enjoy rather than simply ticking it off your list of things to see."

We walked through the Spanish Steps, the shopping area (?Via Condotti?) and then to the Piazza Navona. Prosecco was had at one of the many restaurants at the Piazza, we watched the people go by and we stumbled across a little Museum at the end of the Piazza that was just wonderful. It was small enough to see in an hour and a half, the architecture was beautiful and inside we saw a painting of the Piazza that was done around. 1600 or so. Interesting in that only 2 of the three existing fountains is in the painting as the centre one had not been built yet. Really gives a sense of the history.....A lovely dinner was had at another restaurant. Definitely a place to relax and get a feel for Rome."

It is indeed a beautiful piazza, large enough for three lovely fountains and surrounded by stately buildings. However, unlike most reviewers, we were actually disappointed in its over-commercialization and intense focus on tourists.We were hoping the piazza would be bustling with people and things uniquely Roman. There were multiple musicians, street performers, and artists who could have been in San Francisco, London, or New York just as easily as in Rome. But I guess we weren't surprised with it being the height of the tourist season. We, too, were tourists after all.Still, Piazza Navona is worth a visit, even if just for the fountains. Just make sure you have your expectations set right."

Staff were delightful and made me the most gorgeous iced coffee with ice cream in a pint glass. It was out of this world. On the way out, we visited the toy shop on the edge of the square.

We ate at a couple different restaurants and never had a bad meal. There are a few shops around the Piazza, notable for us was a high end toy store at the north entry, and a leather and stationary store on the west side by the Fountain of Neptune both are worth a visit. Of course the Bernini statue in the middle of the Piazza is the main draw and it is amazing.St Agnes in Agony is a relatively small church on the west side where according to legend Agnes was stripped naked by the Romans to embarrass her into recanting her Christian beliefs. Miraculously her hair grew to cover her body. The church is very pretty and worth visiting.After dinner and taking in the sites go out the north entry and head east for a few blocks to Giolitti's for their iconic gelato."

There are artistes, performers, horse carriages and so many other activities going on at the same time plus of course all those cafes and restaurants around the piazza where you can just sit back and enjoy your pasta and wine. To add to it, it has lovely fountains, just in case you are in mood to click a few pictures. One can also indulge in some cheap shopping, around the area. I would definitely recommend everyone going there to spend a couple of hours there to just soak in everything, and fall in love with the place."

Whereas the forum and the colliseum typify the ancient side of the city, I believe Piazza Navona typifies the modern architecture and attractiveness of the city in more recent years.This is one of the great places in the city to watch people go by, spend a long time at a cafe, looking around the market stalls that are here or just walking around aimlessly. If you've got time to spare, there's nowhere better to spare it."

Finding the Piazza Navona not only showed me a more welcoming face to this amazing city, but offered everything anyone could want for a morning or afternoon's break from heavy touring. Three fabulous fountains, the shape of an ancient stadium, a stunning and important baroque church, elegant shops and restaurants, street artists and musicians and reputedly the best ice cream in Rome draw visitors from early morning until night. I never got tired of sitting and watching the changing parade, of admiring the fountains, of talking with the artists. There are numerous hotels nearby, and I was glad we stayed in one. Walking through the Piazza to start the day and again, stoping for ice cream at the end of it made our stay in Rome a deep pleasure as well as an unforgettable travel experience. Without a doubt, the Piazza Navona is my all time favorite place not only in Rome but in almost al of Europe's cities."

Yet I think it is because from this easy to find place you can walk to any destination in the City of Rome and find it without a map and/or GPS (this may take you awhile, but you will eventually see exactly what I mean). Yes, it helps if it is in the day time because of the shadows (east, west, north south, etc.), but it is such a large north/south spot, it helps with your bearings through the winding streets east of the Tiber. It sure is nice it is open (unlike Trevi Fountains), filled with people (almost all the time), restaurants, shops, a beautiful big church (obviously) and cool fountains even people that have not been to Rome will recognize in your pictures. The obelisk is an added bonus. It is a \"must see\" in Rome, whatever others may tell you. Ciao!"

The 'artists' are mostly pedlars of mass produced art, none actually painting in the piazza, other than a couple of artists who used spray cans and various tools to produce gaudy pictures of nothing to do with Rome as far as I could see. There were 3 or 4 people, sprayed in either gold or silver who stood or sat very still until you approached and then they beckoned, hoping for payment. There were also a couple of girls with their heads buried inside their jackets, a pair of sunglasses and a hat up on a wire stalk that made them look like headless people. And of course, the eateries that encircle the piazza are grossly over-priced. Sorry, but it's not all it's cracked up to be."

Surrounded by pricey restaurants the Piazza Navonna is a great spot to catch a breath and enjoy a Gelatto by the well known fountains.

Lots and lots of people, artists sharing their talents of all levels, restaurants and gelato galore to tempt the palate. It's a wonderful place to spend an hour or more, especially just to watch the Italian world go by and recharge before you head out to see more of the city. There are several Bernini fountains with the Four Rivers Fountain being the highlight (the story and history are worth reading a more knowledgable review). As a side note, my husband is quite enamored with fountains, so we sought out Piazza Navona for this purpose, knowing the three fountains were there. However, we had seen Trevi Fountain the day before, and this can't even begin to be compared, in our opinion, to Trevi. If I were to do it again or to advise others fountain lovers (hence the review), I would suggest seeing Piazza Navona first, so as not to compare. The Bernini fountains are quite amazing and because it's much less crowded than Trevi, you really have the time and space to appreciate them."

The large Fountain of Four Rivers in the middle along with two small fountains either side make for a spectacular centerpiece of this square. With artists, musicians, painters everywhere the square just comes alive with a lot of vibrancy. The periphery of the square is dotted with a lot of restaurants. One can sit outdoors and just watch people go by for hours.But this luxury comes at a price. The restaurants were the priciest in all of Rome with no significant upsurge in quality. If anything we had tasted better food for far less at some places in Rome. Having said that, we understand that this is a prime chunk of real estate in Rome, hence the hefty prices. Overall, a must see in Rome."

We were rather tired from our sightseeing so we enjoyed some fabulous Tartufo ice cream. My favorite was the White Almond Truffle...delicious but very pricey. Lots of artists showing their wares gave the Piazza hustle and bustle. There was a small shop selling handmade Florentine paper and delightful leather goods.

Bustling with street artists and restaurants, the Piazza is pure joy! Right in the center stands the Fountain of four rivers created by Bernini which is a sight to behold! To the southern end is Fontana del moro and to the northern end is fountain of neptune - both created by Giacomo della porta! Right in front of the main fountain is a long bench (which if you are fortunate enough to get space) you can sit and watch the magnificent structure as long as you want.....the Piazza also has so many portrait artists who can sketch you in a matter of minutes....located behind the Fountain of four rivers is church of Sant'Agnese. Very lively and must see!"

The circus layout is readily apparent as the Piazza is is a long rectangle. The Piazza has 3 fountains, with Bernini sculptures. The center fountain, sculpted by Bernini, represent rivers of the 4 corners of the world, the Nile, Ganges, Danube, and Plata. This fountain was sculpted by Bernini for Pope Innocent X, in 1651. The Piazza is a great place to have a meal and just relax and watch all the people stroll by."

We had 1 beer and one coffee and 4 slices of very thin traditional pizza for $27 Euro or about $36 dollars ( generally an afternoon snack for 1 person ) The prices are high but not ridiculous when you move a block or two away from the more popular attractions.

The statues are huge and amazingly beautiful. The square is surrounded by buildings which house many designer shops and restaurants and gelaterias or ice cream parlors. The space around the fountains are occupied by artists showcasing their paintings, peddlers and tourists. There is a humming sound around the place during peak hours.

These themes have been well documented here. Just a couple of tips for the traveller....if jetlag is keeping you awake, or if you are able to get yourself out on the streets of Rome for an early morning walk, get to Piazza Navona by 7.30am and you'll see the true masterpiece square of the Baroque period in all its glory and get a full appreciation of the real beauty of the Piazza, which is completely blighted during the day when it is overcrowded with people, hawkers and expensive cafes. Another tip, just off the street near Piazza Navona is an excellent tavola calda, as recommended by UK Guardian newspaper in their top 10 delis of Rome. This shop, opposite the Senate, near Piazza Navona, is good value for a quick lunch. Perch yourself on one of their bar stools for a great lunch with the locals (not the tourists being overcharged in the Piazza around the corner). It is apparently owned by the same family who have the upscale fish restaurant, La Rosetta. They have vegetarian dishes as well. I had half a roast chicken with vegetables for 8 euro. Bargain. Address is \u2022 Corso del Rinascimento 83/85. It is not very well sign posted but is called Rosticceri. They are on the net at Rosticceri.com. If I was rating Piazza Navona during \"normal tourist hours\" I would rate it one star for a terrible experience but if you go when no one is around and appreciate the beauty of the Bernini fountains and lovely buildings, it is wonderful. It is worth the effort to make it out of bed early just for one day at least."

It would seem they have police continually patrolling the piazza as we saw them high-tail quite often."

A great place to breathe again, after the excitement and bustle in the streets on the way.However if you are planning a visit, be aware this is a tourist set up. The crummy 'art' was surely mass produced tat? I didn't feel we were really part of a typically Roman square, any more than I would believe Leicester Square in London is 'typically English'.I bought my daughter some cheap sunglasses from a seller, I decided what I would pay and just kept nicely saying the same amount until he dropped his price to mine :) he seemed happy and so was I.The caf\u00e9 waiters on the square tried to get us to sit in for coffee but when he told me it was 7 euros I declined, and we walked to the pretty cafe inside the huge gates to the museum at the end of the square. Lovely staff and delicious (less costly) coffee.As part of wandering around Rome this was a nice place but not a must-see and don't kid yourselves about the stalls and sellers."

Of the three fountains, the central one by Bernini, alone, is worth the effort. We wandered through it several times, including our last night in Rome, when we bought some gelato and enjoyed people-watching. The Baroque buildings on the west side are really lovely, and on that evening, the church of Sant' Agnese was open for mass and one room in the Palazzo Pamphilj was lit so we could partially see the ceiling fresco, both adding to the atmosphere."

One of the biggest and I'm guessing surely the longest square (actually an oval) which houses the Brazilian embassy in a beautiful building and Bernini's fountain of 4 rivers this Piazza is quieter by the day with only tourists and painters flocking but happening by night with the restaurants brimming. If you have limited time, then I would recommend Campo de Fiori by morning and Piazza Navona by evening/night. However, its best to visit early in the morning if you want to capture great shots of the fountains."

            "review": "Fountains and statues all over the place.. The Piazza Navona is situated in the historic centre of Rome, west of the Pantheon and is one of Rome's liveliest squares, with many outdoor cafes, restaurants and night clubs in the neighbourhood. It gets busy both day and night, with tourists, souvenir sellers and artists. Get here early in the day or later in the evening for a walk after dinner.The square is built on the former Stadium of Domitian, built by Emperor Domitian in 86 AD. This accounts for the long, oval shape of the square. The main attraction of Piazza Navona is the trio of fountains that adorn the square. The central and largest fountain is the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers). It was constructed between 1647 and 1651 on request of pope Innocent X. The design of the fountain was first commissioned to Borromini, but it was ultimately handed to his rival Bernini. The fountain features four figures, each representing a river from a different continent - the Nile, Ganges, Danube and Rio de la Plata. The statues are at the base of a rock supporting an obelisk, originally located at the Massenzio Circus, near the Appian Way.The two other fountains on the piazza are the Fontana del Nettuno (Neptune fountain) at the northern end and the Fontana del Moro (Moor fountain) at the southern end of the square. The Fontana del Nettuno, also known as the Calderari, was built in 1576 by Giacomo della Porta. The statues of Neptune surrounded by sea nymphs were added in the 19th century. Giacomo della Porta also built the Fontana del Moro. The central statue of a Moor holding a dolphin, a design by Bernini, was added in the 17th century. The tritons are 19th century additions.Another highlight at Navona square is the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone. It was commissioned in 1652 by Pope Innocent X and built on the site where according to legend, St. Agnes was stripped naked, but miraculously saved from disgrace by extraordinary growth of hair. The front facade of the Baroque church was designed by Borromini, Bernini's main rival. Construction started just two years after the completion of Bernini's Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, right in front of the building. The church was completed in 1670.We were lucky enough to get here when an evening Mass was being said - moving, though I am not a Catholic."

The central masterpiece is stunning and the ambiance of the trickling water, blended with the stunning array of colour from the artists' work makes Piazza Navona ideal for several minutes to absorb a truly tranquil atmosphere. It is quite true what the other reviewers have said, the variation of art works on display are mesmorising at best, while others - not so much. Nevertheless it can't be argued that the location is perfect. With several gelateriae serving up reasonably priced, good quality ice cream on hot days, in addition to the small, quintessentially Roman style restaurants dotted around the outskirt of the piazza, providing an exquisite view of the bustle of artists and the beauty of the fountains."

One side of the piazza is lined with good quality cafes and restaurants , while the other is splendid church and palace facades. The open space contains great fountains and impressive street theatre. I'd recommend a simple Roman pizza and beer at lunch time to enjoy the spectacle."

This is one of my favorite piazzas in Rome; churches, statues, fountains, ristorante, gelateria, cafes, street artists and musicians, even the requisite Egyptian obelisk can all be found here. Of course some would decry the crowds, congestion, panhandlers, and the touristy or tacky atmosphere that you often encounter, but I still think this Piazza is an experience not to be missed.A little background first. It is an elongated oval oriented along a norrh-south axis. It takes its shape from the former Ancient Roman stadium, Circus Agonalis, built in the 1st Century AD, that hosted not only fights and chariot races but would apparently be flooded for the purpose of aquatic games and staged naval battles. Nothing remains of the stadium except for a remnant of the wall found under buildings at the north end of the piazza; this intake and drainage point for water drawn from the Tiber River just a couple of blocks further north.Otherwise only the shape of the piazza is all that remains of the stadium. Replacing the stone stands that once seated an estimated 30,000 spectators are churches and palaces, some of them coloured yellow, ochre, and orange. In stead of faux naval ships there are 3 large fountain complexes or \"Fontana\": going north to south these are Fontana del Nettuno (of Neptune), Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (of the 4 rivers), and Fontana del Moro IMoor). The 4 Rivers fountain is topped off with an obelisk. It was designed by the renowned Bernini (he also designed the colonnade around St. Peter's Square in the Vatican) and consists of 4 river gods representing the largest rivers known at the time: Danube (Europe), Nile (Atrica), Ganges (Asia) River Plate (the Americas). It was built in 1651. Each river god has particular identifying features. The Nile god has its head covered as the source (\"head\") of the river was as yet unknown. The river Plate or Plata has a pile of coins representing silver (plata in Spanish) representing the wealth of the New World.Right to the west of this fountain is the church of Sant'Agnese ISt. Agnes) built around the same time by a competitor, BorrominiTo the south of Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, by the Fontana del Moro is the Palazzo Pamphilj which houses the Brazilian embassy.There are numerous places to eat at the Piazza Navona, and they obviously cater to tourists. Nevertheless, dining outside looking onto the piazza is a great way to spend time people-watching. In addition to numerous artists trying to sell their paintings there are musical performances taking place all around the piazza. Caricaturists and sketch artists will drawn their impressions of you, for a price, of course. Fellow-visitors crowd the place throughout the day, so if you want to experience a more serene Piazza Navona come early in the morning; it can still be noisy late at night.The Pantheon is a short walk away. Castel Sant'Angelo is a little further away but easily reached, and St. Peter's is not much farther away from there.Definitely find time to visit Piazza Navona when in Rome. Visit during the late afternoon and evening as the sun sets for a more mellow atmosphere. Never mind the crowds, just take it all in and enjoy."

Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers, as well as an Egyptian obelisk, is the centerpiece set against a monumental church built by his rival, Borromini.

This square is pretty big for an old square but it really is a place where you can spend some time, admiring the water fountains, watching the buildings or simply having something to eat at one of the numerous bars around the square. It s a colorful place full of Italian charm. It's worth visiting!"

Firstly let me say that the piazza navona is a beautiful beautiful place and a must see when in Rome, a great place to sit and enjoy a gelato while taking in the amazing architecture of the buildings and the three stunning fountains especially the fountain of four rivers. However thats if you don't mind being hassled by the sheer number of immigrants hassling you with their wares, you are unable to walk ten feet without one of them pushing a umbrella or a Pashmina scarf in your face, i have no problem with them selling their wares but some are very pushy, they kind of kill the charm of the piazza."

I always tell people to go during the day and then again at night...it's two totally different places.During the day it's a lively art scene with artists displaying their work from pencil, to oils to watercolors. And you can watch them paint while you sip on some delicious wine.At night, the artists have all packed up and are gone and the square is filled with musicians, jugglers, people selling purses and bags, all while the locals do the evening passegiata. I love watching the couples and families take their evening stroll before they settle down for a nice meal.It's not where you want to go if you are looking for fine dining or AMAZING food but it's a delight to enjoy some time soaking up Italian life."

As others have mentioned, it is touristy and a little junky, but we still had a great time experiencing the giant Nutella donuts and checking out the Befana ornaments and nativity scenes.

After 19:00 when there's no sun and people just walk among the streets of Rome, piazza Navona is like a hidden treasure!!Its a wonderful match of Bernini's baroque fountains and all these young and old artists who paint around the square, as the art pass through the age. For me the best place for a night walk,better than Fontana di trevi beacause its an open place and you can feel more comfortable and you can see the striking status of fountains. Better not to eat there, nice but a little more expensive"

It was nice once that's not something you'll find there any time and you get italian christmas spirit but it came out to be difficult to actually see the Piazza and everything it has to offer.The Fair had a carousel, lots of fair stalls only selling christmas ornaments and Nativity Scene pieces. It was very inspiring. Jugglers and apples of love, cottoncandy, there was everything that could fit in the place.The sea of people attending the fair and the stalls unfortunately prevented a lot to see has I wished the beautiful fountain of Bernini that is in the middle of the square and it was almost impossible to visit the Church Sant'Agnese in AgoneThe piazza still have the shape of an old Stadium, since it was the Domician Stadium, and is surrounded by buildings, that were built over the benches. The buildings and small streets that gives you access to the piazza gives you the feeling that it turns out to be a big but somehow reserved place to be and all around there is restaurants with esplanades where you can sit and enjoy the space.I enjoyed to visit Piazza Navona with this Christmas Fair, that seemed to me that takes place every year by this time, but I also wished that I could see it more unfettered. I believe that the perception of the space, its history and art works would be much much different."

We were rushed through the Piazza Navona on a walking tour through the ancient centre, and by the time we wound ourselves past the fountains, other tourists, countless artist stalls and of course, the ubiquitous splat ball vendors, all the time with the blinding morning sun in our faces, I felt like we missed it. It\u2019s more than just a rectangular square, with a few fountains in it. Give yourself some time there to appreciate the Baroque architecture and soak up the atmosphere. And while the cafes and restaurants on the Piazza will do more damage to your wallet than the pickpockets, I think it\u2019s probably worth digging deep just once for the experience. Whether you take a walking tour, guide book, or quick look at Wikipedia before you go, make sure you educate yourself about the Piazza. Otherwise, you\u2019ll miss out. Believe me."

They aren't the best Christmas markets as some of the items seem a little cheesy, but it was nice to look around to say the least. We only spent about 20 minutes there, kind of wandering around. You have to have the tartufo at Tre Scalini no matter what!! It's a couple of euros, but soooo worth it. I think I liked it better than the gelato! Even if it's cold outside, you have to try it. We also tried some of the roasted chestnuts from one of the vendors, but it wasn't my favorite. It's a neat thing to try and you can get about 5-6 chestnuts for about 2 euros. Once again, this is a neat little place to walk through, but don't spend much time here. There are other places worth your time."

There are so many in Rome you could literally waste your entire time trying to navigate around the city looking for all of them and get lost in the process. If nothing else.....this is the only piazza you should visit. Hear me out.....in my opinion, this is how Italy should be if you wanted to mix the history and rich tradition of Italy. The piazza is surrounded by many restaurants and artists painting and drawing trying to capture the essence of Piazza Navona that can not actually be caught. You have to go there yourself to see what it is all about. The Fountain of the Four Rivers was a sight to behold. The fountain is an amazing piece of art itself and in my opinion only being out matched by the mighty famous Trevi Fountain. There are a few other fountains to see as well and it is a great place to take a picture and capture what Rome and Italy is all about."

Unfortunately the main fountain was closed for restoration, but still managed to peep and see how deep, and under the influence of the movie \"Angels and Demons\" - though this film brought me to Rome. Very nice place, a lot of people, artists, various artists, and ... our wonder which one of pop street gray van in the movie - hahaha, great place. Here - a girl performs his program - a balance tank head - photos were unique. You can sit for hours and enjoy the sun, the smells, hustle. Just a feeling that the next day we leave bitter taste left ... Rome is fascinating with its plazas, fountains, places, food, people ... Our dessert was Piazza Navona - still feel the whole atmosphere that reigns there. Elevation man in Rome - must enjoy the Piazza Navona!"

There are many cafes and restaurants dotted around the Piazza and they are lovely places to watch the world go bye for a half hour or two.If you are an art lover, why not check out the many stalls of water colours and sketches.

Unlike some of the other square we weren't over run by street seller trying to make us buy their wears and we enjoyed it so much we went back on our last night for a meal. The restaurant was over priced and the staff were rude but to be completely honest we didn't care as the atmosphere made up for it. First we had someone serenade us by voice singing some English classics then a violinist set up and played some beautiful tunes - we even bought his album. If your looking for a culinary master piece maybe look elsewhere but for a nice atmospheric meal, or even just a coffee, I would highly recommend it!"

There is a permanent carnival going on here at all times of the day and well into the night! There is a constant throng of vendors, portrait artists and picture snapping tourists who tend to crowd around the main attraction! The piazza itself is home to Bernini's fountain of Four Rivers which was commissioned by Pope Innocent X in 1645 and payed for with a much despised tax on ...bread! Innocent also hired Boromini, Bernini's great rival, to redo S.Agnese in Agone, a beautiful church well worth a visit, right next to the fountain! Interestingly, although the much martyred Agnes suffered agonies aplenty, the name does not refer to her martyrdom but rather to the athletes' games (agone) of the ancient Circus Agonalis built by Domitian, which the piazza is built on. The obelisk that rises out of Bernini's fountain infact once stood beside Domitian's temple of Isis! You can still see remnants of the ancient circus around the outside the North end of the Piazza. Great place for an evening passeggiata!"

One of the most well-known and popular public squares, Piazza Navona is a long oval shape, because it formerly was the site of Domitian's stadium, where races were held. This is a must-see for the visitor to Rome. In the center is the magnificent Fountain of the Four Rivers by Bernini, with its Egyptian obelisk. On the ends are the smaller Fountain of the Moor and Fountain of Neptune. Important buildings here include the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone by Borromini and the Pamphili palace, designed by Girolamo Rainaldi; many other important sights are within a few blocks. This is a beautiful Baroque piazza, and it seems like everyone -- Roman or visitor -- ends up here in the evening. Artists and street performers ply their trade; during December the piazza is a Christmas market. While there are many restaurants here (with, admittedly, great views), my suggestion is go a few blocks off the piazza for more affordable dining."

Head of Nile is covered by a sheet not to see Sant'Agnese representing the depriciation of Bernini, while Plata holds his hands up, as he scared that the church will collapse.

He had a touching innocence, seemingly oblivious to the scattering of the fake bag sellers who took to their heels when a police car pulled into the square. And between the two is a fascinating array of artists selling work of surprising quality and very cheaply. It couldn't get much better but then you can add to the mix the sublime Bernini 4 rivers fountain where you can seek out the 'armadillo', an animal the stonemasons had only heard about and had certainly never seen a picture of one. It shows! There was also an amusing group of human staues slumped against a shop wall but when a coin was put into their collecting tin they burst into animated, coordinated life. Most amusing. We stopped for afternoon tea at Tre Scalini. Maybe we were swayed by the glory of the fternoon, but I don't think I've had a better cup of tea in all of Italy."

It was evening and many street vendors were there but enjoyed watching everyone. Many restaurants and gelato shops. Yum! We had dinner and of course tartufo was our dessert. A beautiful, cool evening, just perfect for people watching."

Highly recommend heading to this lovely square in the heart of Rome, I'll admit we did have to wander around a few backstreets to find it but definitely worth the extra effort. Local artists filled the square, amazing central fountains were great to look at & there seemed to be an abundance of places to eat but we did not try anywhere out ourselves so no info there. It was pretty busy, so not sure how young families would find the experience but we managed fine. Overall, just beautiful architecture to admire. Just beautiful."

Located in the historic center of the city, this place is like a cross between Washington Square Park (NYC) and the Main Market Square in Krakow. Artists, street performers, innumerable restaurants, and hundreds of tourists jockey for position here with Bernini\u2019s Four Rivers Fountain, a (fake) Roman-era obelisk, and Pamphilj Palace functioning as backdrops. Families, solo-travelers, couples, tour groups will find things of interest\u2026 if you want a \u201cslice of life\u201d of the touristy side of Rome and enjoy people watching then make sure to swing by here, there is something for everyone."

Two excellent sculpted fountains also adorn the piazza.Fine architecture, a buzz of life and living long into the night, make piazza Navona one of the places on your must see list."

Only an offering is suggested for entry, but you will see that it is worth much more than asked. The dome interior is amazing, and the detail throughout like none you've seen.Photos are not permitted but not enforced, however at such a place I think it is best to adhere by the rules out of respect.It was amazing to me that this church was not mentioned as a key spot to visit in piazza navona, it was the most amazing.Note: do not let the street statues take your photo, they will demand money for the service. Any acknowledgment, including taking a photo of them will result in a plea for money."

I went here twice, first during the day and second, in the evening, for dinner with a couple of my friends. The beautiful Fountain of the Four Rivers by Bernini, in the middle of the piazza was like a oasis in the hot August\u2019s sun. Yes, summer in Italy is extremely hot, thank goodness Rome has so many fountains so if you asked me, Rome should also be called a \u201cfountaineous\u201d City. Surrounding the Piazza are restaurants and other watering holes, we dined alfresco at one of them (I forgot the name of the resto), we ate our favorite pasta, sipped the local wine and enjoyed the great encompassing view of the Piazza. I can understand the romantic aura of this place, but even without my significant other, I had a wonderful and lovely time!

It is a really nice place for an evening stroll. Onour visit, it was alive with people, but not overly crowded. We appreciated thescale of the place. While the Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi) made us feel almostclaustrophobic, this very open long square gave us the opposite feeling and it wasactually quite relaxing to wander along the periphery and people watch. Therestaurants and cafes were open and busy; the odd retail shop was open as well. Thethree fountains are impressive sculptural works of art, and the centre of the squarewas filled with artists, mainly painters (or, more accurately, sellers ofpaintings). If you want to get your 20 Euro painting of a Roman touristattraction, this is the place, but beware of the alleged \"fakes\". From our eyes,it appeared that there were at least a few artists selling their own original works. These people pointed out their certification and website for their art. There arealso the guys selling cheap plastic toys and fake purses ubiquitous throughout Rome. Overall, worth a visit or two."

The food places around make the most of their location and offer rather overpriced and underwhelming standard food- much of which comes out of the deep freeze ( in Rome, it s compulsory to indicate this on the menu ) There are remains of the stadium building at the top narrow end which can be seen below street level through railings."

We enjoyed walking around and checking out the art of many artists who were there selling their work. Many of the paintings were quite reasonable. We bought a couple simple pieces for around 20 Euro, but they had more refined pieces if you wanted to spend more.My parents had a cariacature done for only 20 Euro too. I thought that was very reasonable, and they enjoyed having it done.This piazza is very close to the Pantheon, so it's easy to walk from there. I will make a point to return to this piazza whenever I visit Rome."

Beautiful lighting on the fountain at night and managed to grab a seat at the Ai Tre Tartufi restaurant right next to Bernini's masterpiece. Angelo was our host for the night and fantastic owner of the restaurant. He immediately set up two glasses of Champagne on the hour and his quart of wine which we ordered with the meal was so reasonably priced. But you have got to try his Tartufi which is a sort of truffle with ice creams of three different choices and a banana split which all in all makes it a massive dessert even for the most hungry mouth. He was a really nice guy and his waiters were very attentive and polite throughout the evening and an old guy sat playing classical tenor songs on the piazza which made it a magic atmosphere..we just happened to arrive the evening Silvio Berlusconi was meeting with all the Italian Government cabinet and he it was weird to discover the next morning that he was to resign. Lots of Military and police around the parliament building which was interesting and historical moment to be there. So good a restaurant we went there again the following evening to eats, so take my advice, don't miss out on visiting the Piazza Navona and Angelo's place when next in Rome. He loves the movie 'Barry Linden' so if you meet him ask him about it and he will engage you in conversation for ages!!"

But then, who needs taste? A beige ceiling would have been much more tasteful, but would it have drawn those millions who come here to crick their necks and trample each other? Not likely.So the Piazza Navona may have been even in its day a bit over the top. But like most Italian piazze, what a glorious outdoor space for people watching and socialising. Except that nowadays the space is taken up by purveyors of ticky tack and kitsch, the latter generally of a quality to make Michelangelo weep. And the cafes surrounding the space are, of course, pretty much mass feeding and drinking places -- or so they seem. Perhaps you'll discover an authentic little Roman trattoria amidst the brashness and the crush of humanity; but I would head for the Trastevere if I wanted a good value meal."

I have been there in all Seasons - however, the most magical of allis Christmas time. One should go about 7p.m. at night. There you enter and think you are in another world of wonder. There are all kind of people selling all there hand made trimmings,creches, paintings, hand made leather, little books all hand painted. There are clowns all dressed up. The music plays from all sorts of places. Perhaps the Church there is a concert.Then above a restaurant one looks up and there is a young man playing the violin. All the people are happy and friendly. One never ever feels lonely as the Romans embrace you and make you feel part of this glorious season. Christmas in Rome is a very spiritual experience - as they do NOT decorate their trees or windows until the 15th of December. Christmas is the birthday of Jesus Christ, and true old Italians do not give bought presents for that day. They give home made cookies, jam, pies,tree decorations. However, they do give bought gifts for Old Years last day December 31.That is what I call civilized.Whenever I am blessed to be in Rome I am in Love with Rome.Barbara Ann MacMahon-Firestone."

We didn't have any alcohol, so we were pretty much overlooked by the staff almost to the point that they were rude. The tables where the wine was flowing got all the attention.

I think we took probably 50 photos of the Fountain of Four Rivers and the other two fountains in the Piazza. While Trevi Fountain is larger and much more famous, it is also ridiculously crowded to the point where it becomes difficult to get a good picture. Not so here at Piazza Navona - while crowded it is possible to get plenty of good photos of the Fountain of Four Rivers, which was built in the 1600s (I believe). There is also a fantastic and beautifully decorated church, 2 other smaller fountains, scads of restaurants, and interesting street entertainers at night."

Would it just be for the buildungs or houses bordering the Piazza, with their beautiful colors and the way they retrace the former dimension of the ancient stadium - that's why the shape of the Piazza is actually oval - THEN it would be worth even more than five points. But there are thousands of people, mainly tourists like oneself but also plenty of Romans, walking around and watching the even so numerous semi-pro painters offering their services to do your portrait. I really wasn't prepared for all that busy bubble. Oh yes, the fountain with the obelisk is quite amazing and there are some nice little hangouts to take a bite and a refreshing drink - a pricy one I may wish to add!"

Highlights include the Bernini fountains and the Church of Saint Agnese in Agone. The Piazza Altemps branch of the National Museum, the churches of Saint Augustine, Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and the French church as well as the Pantheon are only a block or two away.But the \"show\" is what really attracts. It's a magnet for tourists and for street vendors and performers. Frankly, most of the stuff sold on the piazza is probably junk, but it's still a fun show. During the season, it's crowded until at least 10 pm at night. The entire piazza is ringed with bars and restaurants -- Tre Scalini gets the highest profile in tourist books and we liked it. The area just west of the piazza (toward the Tiber) is a maze of small medieval streets that is packed with restaurants."

Take a peek into the hotels on the side streets, thinking about future visits. Keep a sharp eye out, because some hotels are almost invisible until you spot their small signs. Look for the Raphael Hotel, on an ivy-covered backstreet, and find your way up to the rooftop terrace restaurant for views of Rome's famous domes in nearly every direction. Piazza Navona and environs architecture is incredibly good - do take a guide book or leaflet explaining what some of the major structures are, and history of the fountains and their meanings.

The square is surrounded by pavement restaurants, none of which I feel tempted to try, not least as I would expect a combination of high prices and relatively low quality.

It really is unfortunate, because they really detract from the ambiance. The police were there to try and scare them off, but all that happened was they would scatter like roaches and then come right back out. What got me was that they police were more concerned with making the talented musicians stop playing after 10pm for noise control, but didn't seem to put to much energy into getting these guys out of there. Seems to me the priorities were wrong, but overall a very nice Piazza to enjoy in the evening hours."

There were many restaurants around the Piazza and many stalls and points of interest in the centre of it. Although we could have been anywhere at this point.The fountains themselves were beautiful, I was fascinated by them and the building surrounding them. There was so much to look at on the fountains.

It's a nice looking square, but the place is entirely overrun by overpriced restaurants serving mediocre food, and touts selling those sticky wall-climbing slime balls that stopped being cool in the 80s (why they feel the visiting population of Rome would be in the market for possibly THE most unItalian product known to man, I do not know).Anyway, it's nice to look at, but I got tired of people trying to pull me into their restaurant. There should be some kind of badge system in Rome. Maybe blue for \"I've eaten, leave me alone\"... or red for \"If you're that desperate for custom, what does that say about your food?\". Either way, I got bored of feeling like a walking ATM and telling people 'no'. Once you've done it, there's little reason to go back."

The vendors are selling a wide variety of wares from the usual tourist stuff to more intriguing art work. We found that the quality of the food in the restaurants was sub par, however. It seems that the closer to the fountain you are the worse the food gets. A crime in Italy!"

At night the piazza comes alive with musicians and art vendors. Some of the art is good, but a lot is of a middling quality for tourists. Don't be afraid to negotiate.

The ancient Romans came there to watch competitions. In the center is Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi or Fountain of the Four Rivers (1651) by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. On top of the fountain is the Obelisk of Domitian, brought in pieces from the Circus of Maxentius. This is a good place to go with family and friends to eat at a restaurant and enjoy views of the fountain and the artists and people who are nearby."

The original sits literally under the current piazza and can be visited by special arrangement. In the evenings on the piazza, local artists ply their works, largely oil paintings some of which are sincerely impressive. The fountains are amazing. Several excellent restaurants are walkable. Dining and drinks are less expensive off of the main piazza on any of the interesting side streets. Favorite place in Rome."

It was a blissfully peaceful way to see the scope of the piazza and enjoy the beautiful fountains and architecture. My most recent visit was with friends and we went after dinner and of course it was crawling with people and open cafes stuffed to the gills. Of course we had to have a glass of champagne and a tartuffo at Il Tre Scalini. So pick you favorite way to see it, but do see it!"

It is surrounded by historic buildings and Bernini's Fountain of Rivers sports spectacular marble statues that are worthy of a visit in their own right. Many artists can be seen behind their easels, and many more spruikers selling paintings. There are several restaurants around the square mainly catering to tourists with too much money to spend. If you wonder through the back streets around the piazza you will find many less expensive and more authentic choices. An excellent choice we found is Restaurant Piccola on Via Cuccagna, just about 50 meters off the square on the fountain end. They have a wonderful anti pasta buffet for EU10, in case you are getting sick of eating pizza and pasta."

Need I say more. Go off the beaten track, don't get lumbered with the prices in the square.The fountains are stunning - well worth a visit. The square had a nice atmosphere to it.

Great buzz about the place, a lovely place for couples/singles to sit back during those hot sunny days, take in one of the many fine offerings for quenching your thirst, and watch life pass by. For families, it is a beautiful place also, lots of mime artists and street performers operate here, and normally a few artists set up stalls here, so a bit of colour day and night. Lovely. Dining just off the Piazza is best, as food prices in the square can be quite high. Walk 1-2 minutes down any of the little streets off the Piazza and you will find a wealth of littel spots serving classic Italian dishes at good prices. Must say, one of the best Pasta Carbonara was had by me near the Piazza."

Especially at night, there are some artists that work to music and gather quite a crowd.

Even in the evening, it seems to be a great . attractions, and it looks like a hot spot for young people. The fountain looks beautiful at night. As always, watch your wallet!

The three fountains in the center of the piazza add to its magic - especially the Fountain of the Four Rivers by Bernini that tells a story of Rome's early connection to remote parts of the world.

Probably one of the most photographed locations in Rome besides the Coliseum, Roman Forum and the Basilica of St. Peter, it is daily filled with people doing things - painting, juggling, just sitting, and eating at the over-priced spots along the sides of the Piazza. Everyone is drawn to Bernini's statue of the Four Rivers (Quadri Fiume) which uncannily supports a very heavy Egyptian obelisk, with much open space within the base which seems too delicate for the task. If it is open, the Church of St. Agnes in Agony is worth a visit for its overly Rococo decoration. I often am asked about how to get there, and unless you are staying close by, I recommend a taxi to the Largo Argentina, and walking to the Pantheon in the Piazza di Rotondo, then turning left at the far corner of the Piazza, to the Church of Santa Luigi dei Francesci (stopping in to see the Caravaggios there), then proceeding in the same direction opposite the Palazzo Madama into the Piazza Navona. If you remember where entered the Piazza Navonma, after browing around, go to the far right of your entrance point, past the toy store out of the Piazza, and then right into a small square in front of the Church of San Agostino. Go into the church, and on your left view the great Our Lady of Loreto by Caravaggio."

We bought a bottle of champagne at the local market and drank it while sitting next to the Bernini fountain in the middle of the square. I would also recommend checking out cafe Bernini in the corner. Free appetizers with drink purchase and great staff. Free wifi too!"

Some times we passed though, some times we eat and sometimes we sat and people/ artist watched. Some great things about this Piazza over others is that it is big so there is lots of space to walk around. There are also benches to sit and rest on. This isn't too common in Italy. Many Piazzas have no where to sit. We also enjoyed the people watching. We saw an Italian couple have a real fight. She was yelling and yelling at her husband or boyfriend. He would yell back a little and she would yell more. Then they got up and walked away like nothing happened. I would have loved to know what they were saying.There are tons of artist and musicians work so it seems like there is always music playing and if you don't think the Piazza is beautiful enough on it's own, the art should satisfy you. The restaurants are pretty good. This isn't where you will get your best meal, but you will be able to find something decent to eat. The waiters are entertaining and friendly. There is almost always a service charge so check your bill for one. I still left a couple of euros for the waiter though as they were so great."

Unfortunately, we had such a short time in Rome that every minute counted. So we walked from our apartment( about 25 mins) to Piazza Navona. It wasn't very crowded as there seemed to be a lull in the crowds, we were sort of in-between the dinner crowds and early evening gatherers. Piazza Navona with Bernini's masterpieces has always been on my list of places to-see. It is not exceptional like the Sistine Chapel but it is a symbol of Rome and the Roman atmosphere is unparalleled to any other, oh well, perhaps with the exception of Madrid. I didn't really sit and have a coffee but walked among the artists and other tourists, inhaling the night air and sweet flavors of Grom's gelateria just within the Piazza. This is really a place to experience, you read about it in literary accounts, travel guides and just about every author writing about travel in Rome refers to Piazza Navona in some way, so I sat by a fountain, took some photos and wandered some more. It was the best 'wandering' I ever did."

There is a fair/market on the Piazza during the day, which was really nice, but it made the area especially busy, and the buildings are pretty but not amazing. There are lots of lovely restaurants on the Piazza but all were pretty pricey; if you move into the streets behind it so much quieter and cheaper, but if you love the hubbub then this is a great place. The fountain at the centre is lovely. The area is busy well into the night.. we were still drinking here at 11."

Not forgetting the church of \"Sant'Agnese in Agone\" by Borromini and the \"Palazzo Pamphilj\" that houses the Brazilian Embassy and was designed by Gainaldi with frescoes from Pietro de Cortona. Of course, a visit to the Piazza Navona is not complete without trying the delicious Tartufo, a wonderful frozen chocolate dessert that was invented by the \"Tre Scalini\" restaurant in 1946.

There is also a beautiful church by Borromini standing tall in the piazza. Aside from all of these beautiful images the place is over run with people selling ridiculous things. I must have been offered a cashmere rug maybe 30 times. The sellers were rude and would even touch you to get your attention. I was with my mother and was even propositioned for sex at one stage. I was quite well dressed aswell and i couldn't understand. People were staring. It was the most uncomfortable experience of my life. We ate in a little restaurant called Tre Scallini. It was overpriced for a very basic menu and service. We did not return here again. There are some wonderful artists, caricaturists and musicians here also....would describe it as the montmarte of Rome!"

Staying down by the Vatican, it was a simple relaxed 10 minute stroll to the Piazza NavonaOnce there we ended up buying 5 paintings for less than one would have cost us in Venice. There must have been 30 artist stands and 30 restraunts with three beautiful fountains.

This is one of the most beautiful individual squares in Rome (if not the world) and should be included as very top attraction requirement for anyone making a list of to-do attractions and areas to visit in Rome.  What we love about Piazza Navona are first the fountains. The Moor Statue and Neptune Statue, backed by beautifully painted buildings, are very camera friendly, helping visitors make memorable pictures of their time here and in Rome. Further, the Fountain of Four Rivers, one of Bernini\u2019s most intriguing works, anchors Piazza Navona as its centerpiece, and is a marvel of a structure. It comes with a history and story almost as good as the fountain itself. Collectively, these fountains make Piazza Navona simply great.  In addition to the fountains, there are some decent church visits you can make directly on or very close to Piazza Navona. These include Sant\u2019Agnese in Agone, just in front of the Fountain of Four Rivers. Santa Maria della Pace (limited opening hours) is just off the square and the Church of San Luigi dei Fancesi is only a couple place East.The atmosphere in Piazza Navona is very nice, many artists are set-up with paintings, drawings and other interesting things to see (or buy). There are plenty of place to sit for a coffee, snack, meal or gelato near Piazza Navona. We enjoy the GROM gelataria, which serves very good (authentic) gelato, just past the north exit of Piazza Navona. Overall, Piazza Navona is something that visitors do need to see while in Rome, even on the shortest of trips. You can target this area when you are in the Historic Centre of Rome. Also, the Pantheon is 6-7 minutes walk east and make a logical next place to visit before/after you have seen Piazza Navona."

How wonderful to wander freely between those gorgeous fountains and to be able to sit quietly and appreciate my surroundings, without being harassed by the street hawkers. (believe me, this is one of their favourite spots). Take the time to visit St Agnes in Agone, the Basillica right on the Piazza for a quiet break from the cacophony that is Rome. There are plenty of eateries around the square, but why not slip down one of the little vales away from Navona, and find a little gem that is not tourist driven, there are lots to choose from."

Visit the fascinating Vatican Museums that were founded in year 1503 when the newly elected Pope, Julius II placed a full-size statue of Apollo in Chains. Since then, many different works of art were added to the church, discover the Gallery of Tapestries, a collection of tapestries of different fabrics from the 16th and 17th centuries and the Gallery of the Candelabra, created in 18th century which contains classical Roman sculpture which dates from the 3rd century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D.Located alongside these museums is the Sistine Chapel built in the second half of 15th century and famous because of its beautiful frescoes, especially the ceiling and the Last Judgement painted between 1508 and 1512 by Michelangelo. Exit the museums and enter the remarkable Vatican Square of St. Peter, with its ellipse of encircling columns in front the impressive St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, traditionally believed to have been erected over the spot where St. Peter was buried after his martyrdom in Rome around 64 CE. Guests that do not have a walking guide for the vatican musuem tour will not be allowed to access St Peter's Basilica directly from the Vatican , so they will have to get back to the car , drive to St Peter's and wait security line (It could take about 1 hour).We do suggest to have a walking guide in order to visit also St Peters Basilica without waiting in line . You will also be seeing the Victor Emanuel monument (the first king of united Italy), also called the \u201cWedding Cake\u201d, built from 1885-1911 and located in the very heart of Rome, Piazza Venezia. Today, the monument contains Italy's tomb of the unknown warrior from the First World War and is also the home to an historical institute and museum. Climb to the top of the famous Capitolin Hill, over steps that designed by Michelangelo, to observe the superb panorama of the Roman Forum and the Rostrum that stands upon it, a platform from where Rome's leaders addressed the city's people. Visit the most impressive and artistic Trevi Fountain in Rome that covers an entire side of Piazza Poli. Then on to Piazza Spagna, If time permits take a stroll through Piazza Navona, a marvel of light and sculpture with its three Baroque fountains by Bernini, a short walking distance from the Pantheon, a classic Roman temple built by Agrippa in 27BC. Tour the vast Colosseum and imagine it in its grandour, explore this well renowned structure; a symbol of Rome, today standing with original wall sections at their full height and exposed sub-arena pens. Conclude with one of the most important commemorative monuments of antiquity, the highest and best-preserved arch of triumph in Rome, the Arch of Costantine, located in the valley of the Colosseum that represents victory over Maxentius in the battle at the Milvian Bridge in 312 CE. www.romelimousinebyjohn.com"

Aside from the pakistanis who tried to sell us pashminas (beautiful ones btw, had to buy! But do haggle with them if you decide to buy), this place is ideal to sit down and watch life go by in the evening. Besides, it is ideal if you want to buy art- watercolours, oils on canvas). The artists price their art very decently compared to spain or paris. One word of cautiion: if you decide to wear high heels, be prepared to walk on cobbled pavements which couldbe a serious death trap! better wear comfortable shoes!"

But beware of eating here, or buying anything from the artists or street vendors - it's a well-known tourist trap and both quality and prices reflect that. You'll pay a lot of money for food which is at best average, you'll be expected to tip well for service which isn't great you've sat down, and you'll be hounded by buskers wanting a few euros for 'entertaining' you with often not great music.But it's an experience. It's a very 'buzzy' square; it has one of the best toy shops in Rome at the top ( 'Al Sogno' - don't let your kids touch anything though, it's not cheap!) and Bernini's famous and stunning 'Four Rivers' fountain in the middle.Piazza Navona is by far best visited in the winter when most of the street sellers have gone and the restaurants are far more desperate for your business, and therefore more likely to offer better food and service. The best time of all is in December when the Christmas market is held there. At that time of year it is, quite simply, magical."

Its worth a look with a guide book."

The local artists not only have their paintings with them, you can also watch them paint. It is a very busy square so if you don't like crowds it is not the place to be. Mind you if you don't like crowds Rome is probably not the place for you in the first place. The only annoying thing is the constant badgering of street vendors who approach you contantly to try to sell you junk toys. That was the most annoying thing in all of our travels to Rome."

Unfortunately it was hard to see all the fountains because of the many artists and their paintings as well as tourists. Was able to take some pictures of the family while trying to get a glimpse of the art work in the fountains. Some annoying vendors kept trying to sell their trinkets but a \"no, grazie\" did the trick. Some human statues (i.e. Egyptian mummy in pic below) were also trying to get you to photograph them for a few euros. No food and drinks here, though; why pay triple the price when you can just walk round the corner or to a smaller street for a delicious cappuccino or beer? Despite all of this, I still enjoyed re-visiting this fantastic piazza."

The Piazza Navona has been a central part of Roman life since the first century AD, when the emperor Domitian built a stadium there for everything from races to Christian executions. You can easily see the outline of the racecourse in the layout of the piazza, and even find the last intact original gateway to the stadium just north of the piazza (look down or you might miss it!). In Renaissance times, it was the embodiment of the ongoing battle between two extraordinary architect/sculptures, those being Borromini and Bernini. And in modern times, it's the place to catch some great street food and hover to people-watch. Piazza Navona is alive with activity around the clock, with great restaurants and bistros located in it and (if you want to lose some atmosphere but save a good bit on the bill) just west of it. It's a place you're likely to frequent daily, maybe to come and stay for a while, maybe just to pass through, but definitely to use as a locus point when you're wandering the maze of twisted little streets that is Central Rome."

It is hard to remember the names of the restaurants - there is one called Scalini which was very pleasant. We tended to find the restaurants on the left of the square (if you are stood by the tourist information) were better quality and a nicer atmosphere for dinner. The first meal we had was made extra special by a street singer who sang for our entire meal - he was excellent and made it really magical. On the other side of the piazza you do tend to get pulled into the restaurants by the charm of the waiters but I would say to be careful - the meal we had on our last night was over-priced and disappointing, It can be hit-and-miss. All in all, a must-see in Rome. There are many piazzas like this but smaller."

A block to the west along the via de tor Millina you will find caffes with cappucino for slightly more than a euro and restrooms. On the north side is a \"toy shop\" called \"Al Sogno\". I bought a beautiful statue from them. There are Real artists in the Piazza and there are people sselling photocopies of art. Find and support the actual artists. On the east at the corner of Corsia Agonale and Corso del Rinascimento is a shop with some very nice oil and vinager carafes. To eat, walk one to two blocks in any direction and then start looking. Good food at good prices."

We eventually arrived at the Piazza Navona and much to my chagrin it was not at all what I expected. It has the beautiful fountains of the Four Rivers and Neptune\u2019s fountain, and the fountain of the moor and all sorts of \u201cliving\u201d statues trying to make a quick buck, such as a cowboy all in black, a pharaoh and whatever else you can think of.

The center is, at any given time, filled with tourists, school groups, vendors hawking wares ranging from sunglasses to art prints, local artists who will do a sketch for E15, and musicians playing for a donation. Yes, it is a lot of fun. There is not much serious about it. My favorite place is at the southern end, where you can often hear a lively quartet of older men playing classic Italian music. It sets the stage for some mighty good people-watching. It is not so much a destination as a way station for people passing through to get to the Vatican or market at Campo de' Fiori. Hang on to your wallet just in case, but mostly the crowd is just looking to get some sun, gelato, hear music, wattch the world go by, and a have place to hang out. Also popular at night with young people."

During the Christmas season Piazza Navona is packed with stalls selling toys, sweets and decorations for the nativity scene or Christmas tree, making it a favorite spot for children. There are also musicians and performers at the center of the square. What I most enjoyed was marveling at the different fountain/ sculptures in the area. Another great spot to enjoy a cup of espresso or a glass of wine and donut lovers or not, one has to try a \"ciambella calda\" (hot donut) with chocolate filling."

The only drawback is that the restaurants are so busy that they are overpriced. If you need a break, they are great for resting and watching all the action in the piazza. You must order something to eat though. Order a plate of cheese and fruit and a half bottle of wine to share. Savor the food and relax as the Romans do."

There are musicians and steet performers, tourists and locals and it really is a taste of roman culture..old and new. The fountain of the 4 rivers is also another masterpiece of bernini....i never knew a INDIAN river was one of the 4 great rivers depicted in the fountain.My honest advice to tourists is to avoid the restaurants by the piazza...they arent the best for food but good to sit around and have a capuccino or exspresso or a glass of wine...for serious dinner...walk a few meter in either directions and you will find a host of restuarants."

Crowds parted at every attraction and we had door to door service. He took our picture, too! A 5 Star fun-filled experience!!!

I thought I might find some young artist's work, but there was nothing of the sort, even though the guide books and websites tell about this being a place where artists paint. There were a couple of portrait artists, but that isn't what I had in mind. Also, just because I'm in Rome doesn't mean I want to bring home a painting of the Colosseum! I might want a non-location specific painting. This aspect was a disappointment."

I regularly visit this city on account of having relatives living there, yet this is one place in Rome that I never give a miss to visit - unlike other star attractions such as Trevi fountain and St. Peter's.The square can be described as Rome's quintessential Piazza - a masterpiece of late Baroque made possible mainly due to the competitive enmity between Borromini and Bernini, and other contributions by della Porta. The square has three foundtains - della Porta's Fountains del Moro (Fountain of the Moor) to the South and del Nettuno (Fountain of Neptune) to the North, and Bernini's star fountain (and my personal favourite in Rome - yes, even more that the Trevi one!) Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers), which represents the Ganges, Nile, Danube and Rio de la Plata. This latter statue can be seen looking in horror at the Chiesa di Sant' Agnese that was built by Bernini's rival, Borromini. This church has wonderful ceiling frescoes and should be visited as well.The only minus point of this star attraction is not the Piazza's fault itself, but the hawkers - be very careful as most of them are under the 'protection' of a racket - you are guaranteed to be overcharged. Most of all, stay away from the Chestnut vendors, which can charge up to 5 Euro for 10 chestnuts! Despite being a seasoned Rome veteran, of of these hawkers managed to dupe me (a favourite trick is to quote the price of a single chestnut!) - to add insult to injury one of these chestnuts was foul and poisoned me, ruining my entire day."

Although, we loved the site of the fountain, there was a Christmas Bazaar going on and it was disappointing that there was a lot of flea market like finds at that time. They were selling witch ornaments which evidently have a story about a lady whose child died at Christmas and she gave all of the toys to area children. Vendors had roasted chestnuts for sale, which we do not have in my region, so that was interesting. Other than that, it was pretty much junk. The fountain of the four rivers was beautiful, much like many of the other fountains that you can see in Rome. Make sure, if you are not on a tour, that you bring your guide book for the story of the fountain. We also had dinner in a restaurant off this square that was very good. Many of the better restaurants in our guide books were closed. I am not sure if this is because we were there during Christmas, the wrong time of day, or what. I recommend getting away from the main square to find something to eat as the menus showed meals 3 times pricier than what we paid for the best gnocchi ever."

There are street performers trying to earn a buck everywhere, but it's not as irritating as you'd think - they really are quite entertaining. Beautiful flowers hanging from the balconies, and beautiful music from violinists, guitarists, and an accordion player. Tons of art for sale on the street, some of it made right in that same spot. I heard after I returned from our trip that there was a Pittsburg Steelers bar nearby Piazza Navona - yes, Steeler Nation in ROMA. I cannot believe I walked right by it and didn't notice this! I will be hanging out in Piazza Navona next time I am in Rome, with my Terrible Towel and a glass of wine, people watching and listening to the wonderful music."

The tour guide we had told us that one of the figures on the fountain is supposed to be shielding their eyes, this is because Bernini had a rivalry with Borromini and Borromini was due to build the church in front of it. The church then has a figure on its own turning away from the fountain. There are stalls there selling art work in the evening lots of place to eat or have a drink. Very beautiful day and night."

Three beautiful fountains, churches, and a wide-open magnificent piazza that is somewhat marred between November-February by an abundance of temporary kiosks/stands that sell every kind of trinket, Christmas bauble and street food. These stands hurt the overall visibility in the piazza, and the restaurant owners hate them since they block the views; however, these temporary vendors have been apart of the piazza for over 100 years so seniority rules here.

There were some street musicians and some nice but touristic restaurants around the piazza. In addition to that a preparation for the Christmas Market was taking place making it even more lively. However, do not expect to see something like the Kristkindlesmarkt in Bavarian towns or Vienna. But after all, this Piazza is beautiful with or without the Christmas Market."

We travelled across 6 destinations in 15 days in Rome, but this was my one favourite place.Calm, serene, alive. The Frigidarium, a Gelato place off the Piazza served fantastic stuff.The cafes lining the Pizza are great if you want ambience, but I recommend the places off the Piazza more. The cafes in the Piazza are unnecessarily costly, and definitely not worth the money.Just walk around the Piazza Navona. And when you get tired, sit and watch the painters and their wares. And then walk some more. You will love it."

The beauty of Piazza Navona is also because of the gorgeous cobbled backstreets, twisting alleys, beautiful houses with glimpses into courtyards. Like everything else in Rome, nothing stands in a vacuum but is intrinsically blended and dependent upon other parts and aspects and all magically brought further to life by plays of light, of sounds, smells and textures. What makes Piazza Navona further special is that it is still so alive today and important to the Roman people. The music is there for people, not necessarily for tourists and so are many other parts, e.g. the street theater performances. This Piazza has been at the centre of roman life for millennia and in this sense it is as modern today as it was ages ago and its heart still beats to the present day enveloping its inhabitants in a magic spel that emerges from the harmonies of space. There is an enormous sense of harmony and balance that seems to affect the psyche, thereby re-balancing all those who come here. It is a Piazza that also lends itself to contemplate the deeper meaning of life."

Navona is one of the better known such 'square' and it is one of the larger ones. Oriented North South there is an elaborate fountain at each end and a central obilisk. Around the edges are numerous restaurants - I ate at one toward the south end - The Tucci I believe - where the Parma Ham and Melon followed by a Canneloni Rose turned out to be one of my more enjoyable meals while in the Eternal City. The other feature of the square - apart from it being a vibrant meeting place for all ages - are the collection of artists selling views from the square, Rome and Italy in general which are always nice souveniers. It can be rather pricey but you choose to buy or not. But by far the best plan is to sit and watch the world go by - and this isnt a bad place to do it."

We arrived just before dusk and what a beautiful site. 3 amazing statues/fountains surrounded by magnificent Italian architecture. I'm a sucker for statues, throw in fountain too and life does not get any better.As dusk arrived and lights from the cafes & restaurants came on, the whole square looked magical. There were local artists & street sellers in the central area. Some of the artists are clearly very talented, I would have bought a painting but for the logistics of getting it home.We were supposed to be 'passing through' on our way back to our apartment before heading out to dinner, but lost track of time at a lovely restaurant (sat outside under a heater) people watching. We left a couple of hours later.TOP TIPUse public transport! \u20ac4 for a daily ticket (to use on buses and metro) or \u20ac11 for 3 day pass. Get a Bus/metro map (well worth the money) so you can navigate your way around Rome for a fraction of the costs of a taxi."

We headed north and just as we left the piazza, we spotted a caf\u00e9 on the corner opposite the street we just exited. The Sale Miele offered a nice selection of Italian pasta dishes as well as pizza. My wife had lasagna and I had a seafood pasta dish. We were very pleased with the meal and service. The waitress was very helpful and spoke very good English and the menu was in English as well. Our two first course dishes and one salad cost 24\u20ac."

The pigeons think it is wonderful for a drink or a bath. The Piazza is always busy - tourists find wonderful photo opportunities and people watch while eating some wonderful gelati from the gelateria on the Corso Emanuele end of the Piazza (get the dark chocolate).Mime actors abound - I feel sorry for the Egyptian mummies - they must get so hot and they cant prevent anyone taking their photograph and not give them anything! Dirty pool that! Later in the evening the musicians and bands come out making a very festive air. In the centre are the artists. As one poster said some are clearly just copy artists while others are a joy to watch creating a new perspective. The cartoonists will whip up a caracature in no time and some of them are very good. I will post a photograph of one. Unfortunately there are also the fake bag, fake pashmina shawl and scarves sellers. I do feel sorry for them as this the only way they can make money to live.Return to Piazza Navona at different times of the day and experience the changing scene.

It really is a charming and romantic square which felt much more relaxed than the frantic city does generally. The 3 fountains are all beautiful but the central fountain of the 4 rivers is a remarkable work of art, especially when viewed at sunset with the church of St Agnes in Agony as a backdrop. The restaurants and cafes on the square are naturally somewhat overpriced due to their location, but it is worth stoping at least for a coffee and a bit of people watching in one of them in my opinion, just for the experience. All the restaurants do seem to be quite aggressive in trying to get passersby in to their premises however, which can be annoying."

At the other end there are the usual human \"statues\" who were not very good - it takes more than wrapping yourself in a yellow sheet and wearing a mask to impress me.The free walking tour guide recommended this area for good food and we reckon he was right."

We'd read in numerous reviews and books that eating here was expensive, so we planned our trip just to go around the piazza, take some pictures and eat elsewhere. Reflecting on this, i think that was the best choice, as the restaurants seemed very expensive (even compared to normal Rome prices) and we couldn't see one italian person eating here! It did feel like a tourist trap.The piazza is very busy when you first walk in. There seems to be one main entrance, where people just stop and start taking pictures, giving the illusion of it being very crowded. I would highly recommend, arriving in the square and just taking and immediate left or right and walking all the way round the outside. You can get some great views from either end and it is much more peaceful here.Its definitely very pretty but for me this was a view only, not stop and have food or drink here."

At night Navona is much nicer with a lot of tourists and painters, there are always some kind of shows that are carried by some people there. You can also find some good restaurants around the square with a pleasant seating plan outdoors with some fans that spry you with cold water the thing that refreshes you."

It is also relatively large and therefore a welcome open space within the city. The fountains can be gazed at interminably although the metal protection around them (presumably to stop people jumping in) takes away some of the magic.The church of St. Agata on the square itself is worth a short visit and offers a welcome respite from the beating sun.There are also many buskers around and the day we were there there was also a political protest going on, making the square all the more interesting and alive."

It is very large and was often flooded to have chariot or carriage races around the the fountains. It is surrounded by dining umbrellas from the adjoining restaurants, but we did not eat here. There is a gelato shop on the west side about in the middle, just north of the large white govt??? building. It has a few steps up and next to a small side street (that supposedly leads to a tiny restaurant that is very good, but we were off time for dining) The gelato was generous and gave us time to linger in the piazza and people watch. Exit the north end of the piazza and head east. You will encounter several important and gorgeous churches, the Pantheon, and the Trevi Fountain. It was a wonderful walk. Wear sturdy sandles or walking shoes, as the cobbles will test your ankles, balance, and it's not worth a sprain. I would return here of all places for sure on another trip to Rome. I loved this more in atmosphere than other piazzas. It was a happy place and maybe just good for drinks as the restaurant reviews sound unenticing. One street to the east of the piazza had an outdoor orchestra performance, (pay at the door) set up for that evening amidst columns, on a lawn, chairs set up, that would be great, but again wrong timing. You can't do it all unless you live there!"

We tried the restaurant directly across from tre scalni in hopes of a better exprince, but to no avail...the food was just as overpriced and just as bad. But hey at least the beer was good.

They never mention the charge before they stand by you - only after!I challenged them whether they were engaged by the Mayor but they said no and that they had to gain their everyday bread and butter. WoW !!They make something like 10 Euros per minute what with the flow of tourists in Piazza Navona.Beware of the Roman Centurion Entertainers in Piazza Navona. They will RipOff your money !!!"

            "review": "Good food just off Piazza Navona.. Piazza Navona is a beautiful space, with some ugly restaurants. I haven't eaten in them all but the ones I have tried, (no names), have been too expensive, for poor food. The general 'vibe' is you are paying for the view, not the food. However, if you want good food, exit the piazza mid way up, on to the narrow Via di Tor Millina and pop into number 27, a restaurant called Cybo.It has only been open as a restaurant for three weeks, so we may have experienced it at its best. It's modern Italian, with contemporary feel. It has a very well stocked, U.S. Style bar, that most will feel at home in. The food is carefully prepared, extremely tasty and reasonably priced, (even at a poor \u00a3/Euro rate). Service is friendly and professional. My wife and I ate here three times during our seven day break and amongst other things sampled the excellent mixed starters, with battered and fried vegetables, cold cuts and a delicious take on the usually bland artichoke. There are the usual starters of prosciutto, bresaola, mozzarella, suppli etc. Pasta dishes are first rate, secondi limited to steak done various ways, scalopine and a few fish dishes. Desserts run to the usual favourites of panacotta, tiramisu etc. but all done with care. The wine list is short(ish) but adequate, with low mark-ups. There is quite a large cocktail list."

It is a people watching place and is made by the wonderful fountains at both ends, the statue in the middle and some of the buildings around the edges. In addition artists display their wares, and it is possible to pay over the odds for a nice cup of coffee and watch the world go by."

Piazza Navona is famous for their fountains - the 4 rivers fountain \u2013 Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi \u2013 but it is also under restoration and completely covered. There is glass at every sculpture, so one can actually see it but it almost all obscured by scaffolding. There are also market stalls with all the artwork fro sale, very very nice. Also visit the other fountains \u2013 Fontana del Nettuno and Fontana del Moro. We watch some sort of magic show and a non-moving street performer for a few moments and continue into the church. St Agatha (or Agnes?) \u2013 Sant\u2019Agnese in Agone \u2013 is very beautiful inside. St Agatha\u2019s (Agnes) very tiny skull is also in the church in a side room, a little gruesome, but there it was. I found out later, she was a 13 year old girl killed in 304 AD for her refusal to renounce Christianity. The church is connected to Palazzo Pamphilj, which is supposed to be the Brazilian embassy. The Piazza Navona is a very lovely square to visit and I enjoyed my time there."

Sure, it's expensive to drink there, but for 18 Euros we had an appetizer, a bottle of wine, and an hour or two sitting outside near the beautiful Fontana di Nettuno (fountain), soaking it all in. It's a great place to relax in Roma."

Piazza Navona is a large courtyard that contains sculptures / fountains at either end., which we had visited before the vandalism mentioned by the previous posts. Around the outside are shops / eateries. Sit to eat and have a relaxing lunch or dinner. Great atmosphere \u2013 good place to sit and watch the world pass by. We did notice that the restaurants right in the piazza are slightly more expensive than others nearby.Several vendors at the plaza were selling counterfeit purses / bags. The women in our tour enjoyed bargaining to get cheap imitation items. The vendors put up a weak front at first claiming that the items are real, but come down very quickly in price if you negotiate firmly. Police here and in other areas of Italy didn\u2019t seem to take much notice of this type of counterfeit sales, although we did see some of the vendors pack up briefly when police were near and then set up again as soon as they were gone. Don\u2019t be suckered in by guys offering to weave bracelets / jewelry. One girl in our group let them put one on her wrist and then demanded to be paid for it after. He wouldn\u2019t take it back and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. Eventually she gave him a few coins (far less than he was demanding) and left. We found similar activities to be quite prevalent in Rome. Be aware of anyone who seems to be offering help or gifts as they likely will want to be paid for it."

We Visited December 16th 2006 .The centre fountain is still covered and undergoing restoration ,but there are glass panels on one side to give you some idea of its great beauty if you haven't visited before.A deffinate must see on a revisit - it's breathtaking.Remember there are two more wonderfull fountains on this characterfull piazza. There is always some kind of 'booth' market / fair here .A childs delight ,one of the few places where there is definately something for them. We watched a frozen statue for ages as the small children dropped coins in his pot. A dark halloween type figure ,white face /black eyes (closed) stooped and holding a fake cat.At the chink of a coin he moved,smiled , the eyes opened looked at you and rolled ,and the cat screeched too.So much pleasure to so many for so little.The best one we saw.A must do for those visiting with children."

They had a little exhibit to the side in Italian and from what we could make out, apparently the fountain had been vandelized and they were in the process of cleaning and restoring it. What a shame. Due to that, the other two fountains were sectioned off by gates and there was heavy police presence as well.We did eat a nice little caffe called Cafe Bernini I believe. However, it would have been beautiful had the fountains been visible."

            "review": "Bad Experience at the Piazza. We recently went to Rome to a wedding and the bride and groom had arranged for everyone to meet at Piazza Navona for dinner on the day after the wedding. We had heard so many great and wondering things about the Piazza that we felt we really have to go and see this place for ourselves. The piazza is vibrant and alive with things to do and see. The magnificent statues, fountains and architect is second to none and I could recommend seeing the piazza to anyone. The problems started when we went to have something to eat. We chose the Cafe Di Columbia in which to have dinner and from the start it was a disaster. The waiter did not want to take an order for 28 people and insisted that we all either eat the same food or handing the paper and pen to the bride, insisted she take the order herself and bring it to him. Customer service at its worse in my opinion. I personally wanted to leave the restaurant and go elsewhere but seeing as it the newly married couple who chose this venue I thought it best to stay put and not offend anyone. The bride eventually took the order and after an hour of watiing the food came out. I should have left !!! The food was either undercooked, overcooked or just plain didn't arrive. One of the group is still waiting today for her childs order. My expectation of fine italian dining did not live up to expectations at this establishment and i would not recommend large groups to go to this venue. I don't think that they can cope. We left the piazza hungry and disappointed at what was supposed to be a unique dining experience."

Piazza Navona did this and more and I spent more of my week there than most other places. This is definitely Rome at its most flamboyant and fabulous, Bernini and Borromini's Baroque Rome in all its theatrical finery. If you have an artists or musicians soul this is your place.From the fabulous fountains and you can't fail to be enchanted by the the Fountain of Four Rivers and Neptune and his wonderful water world. The gorgeous cafes and bars are all round the square especially the wonderful Tre Scalini who serve the totally decadent chocoholics dream dessert the 'Tartuffo'. The food is cooked to perfection too, but you can just as easily drink wine and coffee and just sit and soak up the atmosphere in this little piece of heaven on earth and people watch the world go by. From day to night the place changes magically and I urge you to spend a day here just marvelling at everything going on, from seeing Caravaggio's hanging on walls... to street artists and entertainers giving this magical square an atmosphere all of its own. Spend the morning then visit the Pantheon and the Trevi or wherever you want to go BUT please come back for the evening and see the change.You'll be totally glad that you did and you'll want to come back so throw those coins in the Trevi."

The outdoor cafes surrounding the Piazza are a must-do, even if you only have a cappuccino (They'll let you sit and soak-up the enchanting surroundings without bothering you for the check).While all the wonderful sites of antiquity in the city are a must-see, don't pass up the uniquely Italian experience of just relaxing in a Piazza and absorbing the local scene. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed just sitting and taking in the scene - One of my most pleasant and memorable evening experiences."

Our particular favourite (we visited over the weekend of Feb 10/11/12) was the Cafe di Colombia, where the waiters were very friendly, no hard-sell, spoke very good english and were happy to chat or leave you be, as you wished. The street musicians were at least professional standard, the artists similar, and even the nuisance purveyors of cheap rubbish (plastic toys, glow in the dark wristbands, you know the stuff I mean) were less obtrusive than I've seen them elsewhere. The Piazza is pedestrianised, so a great place to take children, and if you're into such things, is surrounded by alleyways containing a succession of interesting antique shops. There are a lot worse places to pass the evening after a busy days' site-seeing."
