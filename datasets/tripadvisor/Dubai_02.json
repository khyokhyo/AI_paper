I start to be a bit nervous but they made us be really comfortable. Our dolphin was black and I enjoyed every moment, I had so much fun with the dolphin but also with the guides that were with us. I had sparkles in my eyes and a massive smile for an hour and even after, and he best is that you can see it on the picture. Really good quality, I had some trouble to see it, I had to make a different account but made it work and I don't regret that I paid for these ones. Magical memory, thank you so much for this !"

I ended up doing it twice as kids were up for it, although they did have to sit on our shoulders.The experience itself was fantastic, we got a discount as we were staying at Atlantis.The shaming part was price of photos, it's such a downer that you have to pay so much to capture the memories"

Which is fine but the rip off starts after with the picture business where they charge you a fortune for some ugly pics they take for you!Also some of the instructors are kind and nice but some are terrible! They make you feel as if you are inappropriate and warn you that by the time the dolphin comes around you are not even sure if you can touch him or not! I get that they might be disgusted that this is a form of animal exploitation! But then either close it and let the dolphins free or resign and don't work there! Secondly from what i saw the dolphins have amazing facilities there and they were really happy so not sure what was the instructors problem but she had a bad attitude! For what we paid for 600\u00a3 including some pictures was a total disappointment! I get it we touched and kissed these amazing animals but it was all like a 'conveyer belt' experience ran by a few bored and full of attitude peeps (2 of the staff were nice, one guy seemed a bit embarrassed for the attitude of the Lily's instructor and tried to compensate!) And honestly for a quick experience where you touch the dolphin 3-4 times terrorised by the instructor where you don't even smile or move or breath cause you might hurt the dolphin! it is overpriced! We paid it for the little one but honestly we thought it will he the highlight and it turned into the trips disappointment! The dolphins are amazing by the way! Its just badly structured and they need fresh happy staff!"

Wonderful experience and worth the price as included day at the water park & the aquarium (\u00a3300 for 2 people) although we bought the photographer photos which were \u00a3150 for about 60, expensive but worth it I think as will only do it once. Was very organised and informative, felt safe too. The trainers were great, only thing I'd say is that it goes very quickly - you are constantly being told to pose for the photo/look at camera rather than enjoy the moment interacting with the dolphin but I guess that#s for your benefit for the memories. We booked before we left the UK, on 365 tickets website, all good."

You get into the water and interact with the Dolphins, by touching it holding it and getitng a ride on it across the water. The Dolpins are very cute and intelligent creatures, and this was my first handson experience with them. Although this is very expensive it is worth the money"

Was given access to a locker, towels and a choice of wet suit or vest followed a briefing on the different types of dolphins and how to behave around them. We were split into 2 groups and were allowed to take our cameras to the beach part on our lagoon, however to take photos you could leave the water, but to do that you'd miss bits of the experience. We had one dolphin called Tulega (I think that's what she was called) who was beautiful. She was encouraged to swim past us so we could stroke her back then we took it in turns to kiss and hug her whilst a professional photographer took our photos. We were then allowed to take it in turns to play with her by throwing a ball, a ring or dancing with her. We finished off the experience by having her swim past several times so we could touch her and learn about their body and how they behave. Next time I'm in Dubai I'd certainly book to swim with them. There were showers to rinse off afterwards and we were given refreshments afterwards. I've only given 4 stars based on the cost of the photographs afterwards."

We have a family of 3 children aged 14, 11 and 8 and the youngest not the most confident in water, so we opted for the shallow water experience. We were in awe of Lilly our dolphin - ever playful and tender and soft. Tamrin, Molly's keeper was wonderful ensuring everybody had one on one time with the dolphin. It's an experience the kids totally enjoyed - touching, playing, dancing, fetching, kissing and hugging all included - and then of course the obligatory showing off with jumps and somersaults.There is a professional photographer in the water with you, so a little hard to take photos when you can't take your own camera into the water. Prices for photos are a little high I must admit."

            "review": "Once in a lifetime. What an amazing way to spend your 30th birthday. This place is beautiful. Not only is it part of the lovely 'Atlantis', it is in fantastic settings. It is super clean and well looked after. The facilities are great and the staff are very friendly. We didn't realise when we booked this but we actually went during Ramadan. Which to be fair is great because the tourism is non existent so all the trips you do, you certainly get your monies worth. Normally I believe you would have one dolphin to 10 people. We had 1 dolphin to the two of us so this was a awesome one on one experience. The dolphins are very intelligent and very well looked after. We had Jasmine and I believe she is the youngest dolphin and the only one to be born here. They teach you about the dolphins, you get to play with them, sing with them, dance with them. It really was a magical experience and the best 30th birthday present I could have asked for. The timing was about right, I think it was for about 45 minutes and it didn't feel rushed. The water is lovely and warm too. You also get free access to the waterpark in the Atlantis hotel so make full use of this. It is huge and make sure you take your flip flops with you. We didn't and lets just say our feet got burnt because the ground gets so hot. The only thing I would say is the photos are very expensive. However how can you have an awesome experience and walk away empty handed. Take your time looking through the photos because you will be overwhelmed by how many there are, but a lot of them are the same, so work out which deal is best for you."

I did want to have the deep water experience where you get to swim with them properly but it was a little pricey for us so we did the shallow water experience instead and it did not disappoint. The handlers were wonderful and gave us so much information about the Dolphins. Our dolphin was Abby and we each got time on our own with the dolphin as well as a small group. I got to give Abby a big kiss and a hug which was so amazing to me! Something i would love to do again and have some very wonderful memories to take away with me. The only reason why I haven't marked this review as excellent is purely due to the price tag. Very expensive indeed. Especially as it was me and my husband who did it, so over \u00a3300 for just over an hour. BUT, I had the opportunity to swim with Dolphins, so how could we not! :)"

The staff are very helpful and well knowledgeable and the kids do learn from them. The facility is well equipped. The pictures are another way of rip off, very expensive indeed. When you buy the ticket, they tell you cameras are not allowed, however, observers are allowed to bring their cameras and picture from the beach, which is slightly further than the photographer. Do I recommend it... YES."

Starts off by getting changed into a wetsuit or jacket for dolphin encounter experience.. followed by a dolphin presentation in a room.. you get allocated into random groups that have a dolphin each.. usually 4 different groups of ten at the same time.. so 40 odd people at most.. plus 8 instructors and 4 photographers... in which case i thought only ten people in the water.. didnt make a difference but i guess i hoped it was more private.As soon as you are in the water.. it is time to take turns posing with the dolphin while u wait.. once a pose is finished the dolphin will come round towards others so you can stroke until the next persons intimate turn for a shot.. i hoped we would have atleast 20mins with the dolphin one to one but it was probably 2 minutes.. 2 best minutes ever! I love animals and now obsessed with dolphins.. you would appreciate this experience and really love it.. if only the length of time was increased.The experience with the dolphin was 11/10The way its planned by the dolphin bay team is 7/10There are 3 different dolphin lagoons used at different times of the day.. if you have different time slots with families then it worth bearing in mindIn order to capture great moments without having to pay a heavy price tag by using their professional photographer... get a family or friend who isnt participating to take a few shots (they will need the observer pass)Although they wont be allowed to step into water, they will have to take it from the distance, i tried this but ended up purchasing 2 professional pictures (as the ones taken of me were blurry and too far out) As the experience with the dolphin was amazing i wanted a clear shot to cherish.For the sake of the dolphins i give 5 stars"

            "review": "Deep water Dolphin experience. We visited here yesterday as a party of 5 (2 adults, and 3 kids 13,12,9)We had pre booked the deep water dolphin experience (all the kids can swim pretty well) online prior to arriving.Check in was ok, and you are then driven by golf buggies to the dolphin bay part of the park. Once there, after signing a waiver, you are whisked to get changed and for a quick orientation (which was fine, and learnt a bit about Dolphins).Whilst this is clearly not going to be a cheap day, it's also not going to be your average day either. We thought it represented pretty good value, given that we got to spend a good 30 mins with a Dolphin. We were with \"Tina\", and got to hug, get kissed, pushed round, a belly ride, dance etc with her. The kids faces were a picture, and really was an experience they will treasure (and we thought it was pretty cool too !)I knew the pictures weren't going to be cheap, but in for a penny, in for a pound...there is a photographer assigned to each group (6 max) who snaps away during your experience.We got 272 pictures (yes ! 272), and bought them all (digital - you can download them) as well as a poster and 10 prints which was ~ \u00a3175. Given you are normally charged \u00a310-\u00a320 per picture at these kind of things, I didn't think that was too bad, and when we saw some of the pictures of our kids - I have to say they are priceless...So - if you want to swim with dolphins - I'd definitely recommend this. My 9 year old said it was \"the best day of his life\".As part of our deal, we also got lunch included, and a day at the water park. Given I think entry to the water park was ~\u00a370 on its own and lunch \u00a310, it adds a bit more value to the dolphin package."

We have done this interaction twice before as adults and knew that our daughter would love it. The whole interaction is handled in a very professional way and there is never any rush to the proceedings. The locker rooms are well kept and there are plenty of lockers to store any valuables whilst you are in the water. There is a presentation and a question and answer session you get your wet suit or jacket to wear and then you go out in groups of around 8. You have a fun interaction with the Dolphins and get to play, dance and stroke them. Well worth the money. Professional photographers take plenty of of photos of you that you can purchase afterwards. This is the only way that you will get decent photos of your interactions. They are priced but you get 50 images downloaded to a memory stick for around \u00a3100 depending on the exchange rate. You can have a spectator take photos for you but they are not allowed in the watt and you gave your back to them must of the time. You will also get access to Aquaventure with this interaction so make a day of it. Book the 0930 interaction and spend the rest if the day at the water park."

However, this was the one thing my 4 year old wanted to do during our trip to the Atlantis so I put my beliefs aside and we booked a dolphin encounter. What a beautiful experience it was. The dolphins are clearly very loved and cared for and it was a beautiful moment to see these wonderful animals up close. The dolphin trainers clearly know what they are doing and before you are even allowed in the water you are given a 30 minute talk about the animals and the do's and dont's of your visit. The look on my daughters face was absolutely priceless. If you have any reservations, like I did, try and put them aside because this is a really wonderful experience."

This feels so personalised and each person gets time to hug and kiss and swim with the dolphins. My 11 year old son just loved it and you feel an incredible attachment to your dolphin. You get the park free after getting this part over and that's great they include it in the price. No need for towels either. We did buy the album with 15 pictures and the huge picture to frame. Expensive but so worth it. This experience really gets you to appreciate the animals and what's out there in the ocean. You do wish they were free to swim back into the wild. Maybe one day.

E. ca. 1'000 US $)it was the quality and the how: worst: if you don't buy THEIR pictures, you leave without a pictured memory. \"for the safety of the animals...\" you are not allowed to take pictures. Then they sell you a minimal version at almost 100US $.the introduction was basically looking at a rather cheep video, that would give you 4 to 5 answers to a question, and lets you choose the correct one. Not very creative and mostly unneccessary. (The truely neccessary Information could be given within 2 minutes, no school room is needed for this. OR: Show a short nice informational video.)Finally the encounter with the animals didn't impress me at all: i came without prejudice, but there was no sign of joy on the side of the animal. all i saw was a well trained and well behaving animal that did what it was told. All after all to receive fish as a reward. Everything else seems to happen in the romantic phantasies of the visitor: the personal connection, the magic moment of touching (i doubt that the animals appreciate to be factorilike presented and touched by strangers) until the personal kiss. All after all: our children loved it, and I played \"good daddy\", danke with the dolphin and bought the pictures to see them happy. Later in life, they might change their point of view, white yesterday, a wish of theirs had become true."

Daphne had a great sense of humour who gave us the briefing before we had our session. Andreas and we think she she was called, Yvette, from Essex were our instructors who looked after us for the session and they we helpful, reassuring and remembered all our names :-).... The experience itself was really magical and one that I would definitely do again when I return to Dubai next year and one that I would sincerely recommend to anyone.. The highlight of course was the main attraction, our dolphin called Central.....

From my experience the dolphin I worked with and the others that I saw did appear to be happy, well cared for, and playful when alone in the pools. There are a numer of experiences on offer including shallow and deep water. We took one ofthe deep water packages but don't worry, the clothing provided is very bouyant and you aren't teading water all the time. The handlers work in pairs and rotate throughout the session and you after a breifing sesion you get to dance and swim with the dolphins, I say swim, the dolphin drags you along for the ride and that is most exhilarating!It is expensive but if you are staying in the hotel you can get a discount."

There is the only reason why one should go to Dubai & that is to swim with the Dolphins. The amazing team of trainers have done a terrific job and are very thorough in their briefings before we even get into the water - it's clear they have the animal's welfare very much to the fore. Holding onto a dolphin whilst it pulls you, very fast, across the water (a lot of salt water swallowed!) was exhilarating; feeling the animals gentle kiss on one's cheek...oooohhh - I was so on cloud nine. Whilst it is not cheap, it is so very worth the money spent. There is a shallow water experience for families and an official photographer who takes lots of photos for you to later select from - it's not permitted for anyone to take photos from the beach. The only odd point is the too many steps in the process from time you arrive at Atlantis until you get into the water but I guess Dubai is very labor intensive and it gives jobs to the many foreigners who come to Dubai to work. Cost of this ticket also gives you free entry to the rest of the wonderful Atlantis water park for that day."

A brief factual presentation was done and then it was straight onto the experience.We were in a group of approximately 10 people with the dolphin named S2, both George and the trainer for S2 (we didn't catch his name) were outstanding. Our son was nervous and wouldn't leave our sides and they were both flexible and patient to ensure we didn't miss out.An unforgettable experience which has fuelled our little boys love of animals.Photos are expensive but on a par with the usual theme parks (Disney, Alton towers etc) if you wish to buy more than 5 photos then go for the USB as its the same price and you can print at home."

You were taken by golf buggy to the dolphin bay area and given a wetsuit or life vest (your choice) before being seated for a 15 minute briefing. It started a bit haphazardly though as a number of participants arrived late and ruined what was an interesting talk by one of the staff. Once done we were put into groups of around 9/10 and taken to the shallow area of the enclosure where we met our dolphin. First off came the photographs, all seemed a little shoehorned in rushed to be honest. The trainer then told us about our dolphin and gave us the experience of touching and getting close to them. Finally they have us the option of dancing with them or throwing a ball or hoop before the final picture. The last thing came a short demonstration of the dolphins jumping out of the water and splashing is which was nice. The actual time with the Dolphins was roughly 20-30mins. Make no mistake, this attraction is expensive when looked at in isolation. We paid 750 Aed each (\u00a3140 each) and that included a 100 Aed discount each for booking more than 2 weeks prior to attending. The official photographs are even more expensive. The cheapest photograph was 75 Aed (\u00a314 per photo!) which came in a flimsy paper pouch with certificate. The hardback cover was 100 Aed (\u00a319) per photo. Other packages were offered but were eye-wateringly expensive. What made this bareable was free entry into Aquaventure water park next door which is usually 250 Aed (\u00a350) each. One word of advice though. If booking the dolphin encounter and you have a friend/family member that wants to watch/take photos from the beach viewing area - do NOT pre book this via the website as they charge 300 Aed (\u00a356) per person. On the day when collecting the dolphin tickets we were offered this for a family member not taking part in he encounter for just 40 Aed (\u00a38)!!!It was a great experience, especially to see my daughters face and to have those pictures/memories forever. However, it was more expensive thank it needed to be and I wouldn't need to do it again."

For the actual encounter, you are divided into groups of roughly 10 people, After being given strict instructions on where you could, and could not touch the dolphin we were allowed to kiss the dolphin, hug it and then dance or play with it. The trainers were very knowledgeable and seemed to have a good relationship with the dolphin. I found the actual encounter a little short for the hefty price paid, as it probably lasted 30 mins for all 10 people. Thereafter you are given complimentary drinks and use of towels.

Except for the dolphins.This was a memorable experience and absolutely the best thing we did in Dubai. I definitely recommend this, especially for the kids.Basically you sit in a shallow pool and play around with a dolphin learning stuff about them under the supervision of instructors who are very friendly!One little note though, the price of the pictures is a rip off. The Dolphin Encounter experience costs around 700 AED (175 \u20ac) per person if you book ahead, but nowhere it is mentioned that you must pay for the pictures separately. A USB stick with 50 pictures costs 550 AED (137,5 \u20ac)!!!"

The Dolphin Bay was the best option for me as I do not swim and swimming with dolphins in the sea would not make me comfortable. The environment is very friendly, and the whole experience is really fun if you want to get really close to those beauties of nature. Every participant is given a quick training on how to interact with the dolphins, which I think is a good thing and the trainers looked experienced. The experince is ideal for small groups and also children, and you can choose to swim with them or only interact and play tricks/dance with them. I had a bit of doubt before going as I am against the idea of animals in cativity in general... but I saw that they were treated, trained, and fed well. A bit expensive however for a less than an hour experience but worth it as it's a unique experience and you also get access to the waterpark and a few other things with your ticket."

One where you swim with the Dolphin and the other where you are kneeling down till your neck in the pool with the Dolphin. Personally, I did not see the difference. One is on a shallow end and one is on the deeper end. Both places you get wet completely cause the Dolphin splashes you with water and you have kneel down to take a picture with it. Also, its better you leave everything in the room- if you at staying at the hotel. You are not allowed to wear any jewellery or hair accessories including hair ties. Your hair is going to get wet. I thought it was nice. They do small tricks with the Dolphin and you get to know some information about it. I suggest doing the first program of the day at 930 am cause it is relatively more private and quiet. The trainers are good and can speak well. Over all a good experience.If you are hungry and it is very early in the morning- there is starbucks right in the area for a sandwich!"

Shallow water is for those who can't swim.Before you are allowed to swim with the dolphins, you have to go trough a short brief with the instructors. They explain were and what to do when you are in the water with the dolphin. Different techniques to make the doplhin come and kiss, hug and play with you. It's really interesting. So the best part, In the water you are in a group of 6 people and there are two photografers on each side of the water to take a snap of your precious moments with the dophin. I had so much fun doing this. If i ever go back, i will definitely do it again. I have my photos as a memory i will cherish for life. My dolphin Yasmin was a stunner. Love her <3"

Yes a very expensive experience (but book online in advance by 14 days and get a slight discount) but it was well worth it as made my daughter happy. I did feel it was all slightly rushed...I had a 3 year old to get changed and by the time we were changed our group had moved on and I didn't know where they had moved on to and we ended up in the wrong place. They really should have checked that they had everyone out of the changing rooms. Thankfully one of the staff noticed and took us to the right place. The photographer did take OK pictures but they don't really care how good they are. Our family photo with the dolphin hug was ruined as my 3 year olds face was hidden behind the dolphin's fin... he could have at least pointed it out and asked me to lift her higher but it all seemed so rushed.....have your turn, quickly get a photo taken and move on. Photos cost over \u00a3100 for a USB with all the photos from the session (about 60) and 10 printed photos. For the price it would have been nice to not feel so rushed and have some more time with the dolphin, but still an unforgettable experience."

However, the staff's routine with the dolphins is strictly timed and I felt slightly rushed through a tick list of items to do with a dolphin. I did the Deep Water \"Adventure\" with my 11 year old son. My wife did the Shallow Water Encounter with our 9 year old son. I noticed one overseer hurrying up the dolphin trainer to keep them strictly on schedule. Last year we swam with sea lions in Lanzarote which was less than a third of the price and felt more personal and more fun. It's basically become very commercialised at the Atlantis Dolphin Bay due to the high demand for the activity and fails to make the experience feel as \"special\" as it could do. Photos are another VERY expensive extra, e.g. AED 650 or c\u00a3125 for 10 prints and a USB stick with all the photos of your family on it. You can't blame them for running it as a business, and you do get the impression from staff that the dolphins are very well cared for. How could it have been better? A chance to watch the dolphins interacting with each other. More time doing something resembling \"swimming\" with a dolphin. Let the customer throw the dolphin a fish. They could have split the customers up across the three pens, rather than having 32+ people all in the same pen with more limited space and it feeling like a factory-style process to make money."

This is an amazing and unique attraction, especially for nature lovers. Although the price is very steep and burns deep holes in your pockets, but it is totally worth it.You get to spend 30 minutes with a Dolphin and have option of kissing it, dancing with it, making it do tricks. The trainers are very amazing and make sure that you do not feel scared.You are not allowed to take photographs of the attraction yourself if you are in the water as they have a designated photographer. However, if there are people accompanying you (Needs a reduced price admission ticket), they can take pictures from a distance from the beach (Can't get in the water). If the zoom length is good enough, there is scope for decent shots. However, I suggest that you take their photographs. All photographs for a family can be had on a Thumb Drive for ~600 Dirhams. The quality of the photographs definitely makes up for the price and this is one experience which you would definitely want for prints etc.The place has good locker and towel facilities. There is also free non-alcoholic beverages at the end to cool off."

Unfortunately that was the end of our great day out - The staff in the Shop were rude, bad tempered and seemed as if they didnt want to be there anymore than I did, whilst serving us the girl on the till was shouting down the phone that she was due her break and it took 2 hours for our Photos to be processed - in fact it took so long I demanded a refund as was by this point just losing the will - but the best was yet to come honest !!We left the Hotel and went to ask for a Taxi so we could go back to out Hotel but were told 130 UED - when I questioned why the Taxi fare had gone up by 100 UED from the morning was told if you want to pay that rate you have to join the public Taxi queue which we did - 1 Hour 15 mins later we got into a Taxi with the promise we would never in a million years return to that Hotel ever again."

Check in process was pretty smooth. There is no information prior to showing up that tells you when you need to be there. You are fine to show up at 9:30am for a 9:30am session apparently. The photographer I had for my session was not very good at capturing photos. One thing they should be aware of is that if you scuba dive, you still want one of those cool photos above water with the dolphin. They need to upgrade their cameras and also get GoPro cameras down there. I would rather have a video clip than a semi-blurry photo. Overall it was almost worth it experience wise. The time with the dolphin was very scripted and not as free flowing as you would have hoped. Every single move the dolphin made was part of a routine. The direction given prior to going under was only fair. There is a good amount of information to know and they just pour it out like you have heard it 1000 times. Be better about your communication."

You get the most wonderful trainers that brief you well and all the dolphins are very friendly and listen to the commands of their trainers. You have to pay separately for the pictures which is around 500 dhs to store them all in the USB. The rest the royal swim was 1200 dhs. The dolphin scuba dive 1500 dhs. The Shallow water interaction was for 800 dhs."

They provide a very thorough introduction about dolphins, ahow to behave with them in the lagoon, etc. (maybe sometimes a little bit too long?).You get to join a group of 6-8 people, and take turn for the different activities with dolphins.I have done the shallo water, as well as the deep water experiences. The only add-on to the deep water is, that you get to be pulled by a dolphin whilst holding on his/her fins. I didn't feel super comfrtable about it and much prefer the shallow water experience where dolphins are left in peace.A photographer is on the side of the pool constantly snapping pictures, so you can get to choose and buy some pictures afterwards if you want to."

We only managed to sort it the day before we wanted to go thanks to our hotel concierge contacting them for us. When we arrived we were checked in, given meal tickets, food voucher and aquarium vouchers then pointed where to go. We started to walk then opted for a buggy which was a great idea! Once we were there we sat down with a little bleeper that went off when it was time to go in. Pre warning that your hair cant have any bobbles, clips or accessories in and no earrings or any other jewellery can be warn. We then were given our wetsuits and be prepared to be sucked in! There was then a little class explaining about dolphins, what to do and what not to do, then we were separated into groups. We chose the deep water one and we are so glad we did. We all got a dance, hug, kiss, swim and more with Bucker our dolphin. We were so surprised at how much time we actually got overall. I would recommend this to everyone, it made my holiday."

We arrived at dolphin bay having booked it through our hotel, to start off we were disappointed that our hotel didn't explain that if we chose deep water interaction we could swim with the dolphin but this was a hotel issue not a dolphin bay issue. We did shallow water and even this was a brilliant experience. The lady had recommenced to me afterwards that the royal swim would be the best one for us so next time we would do this. We was greeted by the staff at dolphin bay and the transition from changing into our wetsuits to the briefing before the dolphin interaction was very professional. We was in a small group and our dolphin was called Central. She was beautiful and attentive to everyone. She allowed us to hug her, kiss her, play ball and dance with her. The Dolphin trainers were absolutely professional and was able to answer any questions we had regarding the dolphins. I much preferred this interaction rather than watch animals do shows as I find this is unfair. You can really see that every trainer had a connection and passion with the dolphins. Afterwards we were given refreshments and could change and show etc. I would recommend taking your phone and leaving it with your towel by the beach so that you can get a few snaps as the only thing I would say about the dolphin bay is that they really bump you on the photographs. They are very expensive and don't offer enough options ie if you just want 4 or 6 they would want 75 dirham per photo. Or 500 dirham for the USB which works out to nearly \u00a3100 for a USB. I would have rather they charge more to swim with the dolphins that over charge on photography. Other than this the experience and professionalism of this attraction was brilliant."

The keepers are very professional and try to keep the animals in a nature-like habitat. It seemed like the dolphins were happy and the place was not overcrowded with people so they had their off time, as well.There are a number of basins with different groups of people who have booked different packages, and they also have a number of dolphins. They all had names and different personalities... I recommend to anyone!!"

The speech before the encounter was really informative but lighthearted and funny. The encounter itself was just amazing. It was only 30 minutes, but every minute was packed with photos, dancing, interaction of all sorts with the dolphin. It cost just under \u00a31000 for the 7 of us, but it was well worth every penny. The photos afterward were great too and cost about \u00a3100 for a USB with all of them. My advice: do it if you can. Everyday. The water park afterwards (free entry) was just amazing too. Fantastic slides for all ages and the lazy river was the best I've been on. Only disadvantages were: poor shower facilities that were jam packed and you need to smuggle flip flops in your bikini as if you attempt to walk anywhere that's not wet, you risk 1st degree burns."

There was six to a group but there were about five different groups in the area going on at the same time. It didn't really feel very special. The short belly ride back to shore by the dolphin was the best bit but did feel let down by the rest. I'm glad we did it because I would have regretted it if we didn't but it was quite a let down if I'm honest. Expected better from the Atlantis."

After experiencing them in the wild in the past, I never really swam with them ... until we went to Dolphin Bay.My hubby and I went together. While we fell in love with the dolphins, it was far too structured/limited for our liking. We were in a group with four others, so six people total, and it was Go Go Go all the time. There was no real time to interact with the dolphins (free play time) besides the structured interaction. Of course it was an amazing experience but it also made us wonder how much \"free time\" the dolphins actually get. After all they are animals and not just inventory.You are not allowed to take cameras or anything else besides your own body (no jewelry etc) into the water with you. There is a visitor ticket for friends or family to come inside the venue with you so they can watch and take pictures from the beach. There are loungers for individuals with visitor tickets.Professional pictures will be taken by photographers on site but their pictures are pretty pricey. We ended up buying the digital package, which included all wanted pictures within our group, and split the cost with a girl that we became friends with in the group. That way it was affordable.On a different note we have to say that everyone was very nice and friendly. Having access to the water park as part of the package was wonderful.We had a great day overall but would probably not do the dolphin encounter again. Next time we want to play with dolphins we will go on a Musandam trip and hopefully get lucky and be able to play with dolphins in the wild."

Each team has about 6 people. You are supervised by well trained guides who allow you to stroke and play with the dolphins whilst a photographer assigned to each group is constantly taking photos for you to keep as lasting memories. Such a great experience, you have to do it at least once in your life and Atlantis made it a great experience. If you have time, try and get a morning slot and then spend the rest of the day at Atlantis' Water Park."

We did this as part of our honeymoon, we did this hoping it would be amazing and... it really was, we got pushed through the water whilst two dolphins where pushing your feet and another when you are holding their fin. It was mind blowing. We did it in a group booking, which was fine, you didn't feel like there was to many, I think there was about 10 of us. We go to stroke and kiss the dolphin. Then when it was all over, they showed us some awesome tricks. It is 100% worth the money. Just be aware you can not wear any jewelry, earrings, hair bands NOTHING! So any religious bracelets have to come off too, also my husband is a 17st rugby player and they couldn't pull him or push so if you are a big guy/person might be worth watching?!"

I was however disappointed - well in dolphins themselves really. They are beautiful and clearly intelligent and trainable but mine showed no pleasure from my interaction with her. She didn't even look directly at me when I softly tickled her belly which I was assured she'd feel. Playing with a happy dog or cat is so lovely because they respond with pleasure. Sadly I had no response from my beautiful dolphin."

The whole family had an amazing time, even those of us who initially weren't that enthusiastic about going. It was fun and informative. I was glad that we booked the earliest time slot available (9am). The time worked perfectly because it was not busy yet and we had the whole rest of the day to enjoy the free admission to the Aquaventure Waterpark. One thing to consider while preparing to go is that you cannot go into the water with loose items such as glasses, sunglasses, hats, or any hair bands, clips, etc. The only minor inconvenience I experienced is that I had to take out my pony tail so my hair looked disheveled for the pictures they take during the session. Obviously the dolphin's safety is more important than my hair though."

This was definitely the right decision! Although being around \u00a330 more, it seemed to be well worth the money. The encounter experience allowed people to play with the dolphins in shallow water and in larger groups. However the adventure programme was a lot more interactive, in smaller groups and in larger water. Only downside was that on the Atlantis website stated that Dolphin adventure would only be maximum 6 people per group. However ours had 7.It was a once in a lifetime opportunity which was extremely fun. You are unable to take pictures when in the water but there is a photographer. At the end we purchase 3 pictures which worked out around \u00a330, so quite expensive but we wanted to have a memory of our experience."

Good variety of wet suits and lots of huge towels that you are allowed to take into Aquaventure waterpark after your dolphin encounter so don't worry about bringing your own towels.You have a locker to use during your experience but not afterwards. The briefing was fun and educational. Once at the pool, you get time to quickly stroke your dolphin a few times, as she swam past, pose for a kiss photo and either dance with her or throw a hoop or ball. I felt it was a bit quick and didn't have as much one on one with the dolphin as I had hoped for, that is what lost 1 star in this review. I guess my expectations were, perhaps, a little high.In conclusion though, it was a great experience, I have ticked it off my bucket list and would probably do it again but I will try the deep water experience next time for variety"

This is one of the most amazing thing I was lucky to do as I always thought to do this but always was concern about pricing though when I was in Atlantis it was slight cheaper like 675dhs per person compare last week of 775. I opted for it and it was just wow and amazing it's can't be explained in terms of review here. I feel it was one of the best thing I did during my 8 days of Dubai holidays. If okay with price which is not cheap than you can go for it and it will be one time experience."

My wife and I picked the dolphin adventure, as it included swimming with the Dolphins rather than just \"encountering\" them in shallow water.Swimming with the Dolphins was quite literally unbelievable! It is expensive, the trainers are kept to a tight schedule with the amount of people they have to deal with in a day, but it truly is a life experience. Most true life experiences do not come cheaply, but this was worth every penny. It did go quickly, but part of that feeling is because the activity is so surreal. The trainers are brilliant, knowledgable, and the animals are very well cared for. The pre-experience talk was also good, and set up the interaction. You get what you pay for, in the \"adventure\" a belly ride which is surprisingly lengthy, dancing, hugging, kissing and spinning with the dolphin, as well as touching it. We were separated from several groups of \"encounters\" which looked to be the busiest experience with the biggest group sizes. Fantastic on the whole, and unforgettable. Forget about the money and pay for this!"

It's still very expensive... though don't try taking photos yourself.The staff were knowledgeable and bouncy and the experience was fun.

The trainers are very knowledgeable and really look after the Dolphins. We had a dolphin called butterlilly who is 5 years old. We were able to stroke her and play with her but in very strict circumstances ; brief touch/kiss encounters only a few seconds at best. for the money paid we expected more interaction. The photographs are very pricey - we got 3 photos for 225Aed. It may be cheaper to pay for an observer ticket and get someone to take lots of photos for you.

As a participant, you're not allowed to have a camera with you, which allows the resident Dolphin Bay photographer to charge you a fortune for that memorable moment."

Was met by friendly staff at first. Taken to changing room for wet suit and vest. Upon exiting we met with a person seeking to impose her views on us in a very autocratic and inflexible way.Got yelled at by employee called Chere re wife's earings, jewelry and headband. Previously told by Atlantis staff Abbas that it was ok to leave a few items on. chere yelled, scolded and scorned us with no explanation. Upon asking to talk to a manager she lied flat out in front of us. A friendlier staff came and treated us nicely, to which we happily explained the situation and complied. Airport security is a breeze compared to way Chere dealt with us. Friendly manager went to get Chere to apologize to us and then came back saying Chere refused to claiming this was the normal way she dealt with people. Okay... Then during the swim, the dolphin tail-kicked my wife in the stomach. The result of which was she got yelled at by the trainer, someone called Younis, for claiming she did something that she didn't - yes I recorded the entire incident and wife was not at fault. In pain and under duress, Younis did nothing except force her to wait on the side whilst she got no medical or staff attention at all... The good The photographer and another staff who were not part of the group came by 5 min later and tended to her. Younis was still yelling at her in the background (yes, I have that recorded on video as well). Director Yuri then came by to see how things were going. We explained the situation to him and he kindly said that he was going to get Chere to come and apologize. He claimed she would not apologize and had left to go home, given that she was upset but 5 minutes later we saw her walking around the dolphin bay still peeved. Your experience will vary. As we have seen positive reviews and the not so good. Wish you the best of luck when you get there. It is like most things, all about the money..."

They made the experience for us, and Sol our dolphin of course! They were informative and fun. We were the group that laughed the most and half of us were little kids. My daughter is 4 years old and you never know at that age whether they will freak out or not. The handlers really know how to make kids feel at ease and teach them how to handle the dolphin. We had our pictures taken throughout and left with 10 printed photos and a usb which cost us 650 dirhams. Usb containing 60 photos of the experience.

Atlantis hotel certainly managed to create a legend about this activity but having experienced it with my family and kids I can tell that it's more a tight ship spirit, clockwork, that a legend. The price is SKY HIGH for what one gets at the end. Most of the time it is blablabla in the dolphin centre. The stuff tries to win the time making silly jokes and repeating few times the same facts about dolphins.Once you are in the water of the bay at last, it passes by very very quickly. It is a group activity and you don't have a feeling to be in contact with the dolphins. I've got a feeing that the time in the water was more for taking pictures by their photographer that anything else. By the ways the quality of the pics was quiet disappointing. My daughter is 5, so I had to go for Dolphin encounter with her. My son is 10 and he swims well, so he went for Dolphine adventure with the father. They push you to accompany the kids and pay for adults as if they didn't have enough cheap labor stuff to go to the water and accompany the kids. The girl who was leading the activity in the water was quiet rude with us. My daughter behaved very well and was quiet shy and I personally don't care at all about dolphins but the girl spoke to us in the way as if we were aggressively attacking the dolphin. Sincerely I didn't want to touch it at all and found rather stupid what they proposed us to do. My daughter was nearly scared by the aggressive behavior of the coach.My son experienced different package and said that it had been \"OK\", not more excited than that.For a family of 4 we paid nearly 1000 USD. No, it is not worth of the money."

            "review": "We Loved Black and Ini. My husband and I visited Dolphin Bay at the Atlantis Palm Dubai and we had the time of our lives. I participated in the Dolphin Encounter program which is done in waist-high water for non-swimmers, children, or those like me who are afraid of water. ;-) My dolphin's name was Ini and I was able to hug her, kiss her, and dance with her. If you didn't want to dance, you had the option to play ball with her. It was so exciting and for my birthday, she sang Happy Birthday to me! I wanted to take her home with me!! My husband participated in the Dolphin Adventure program which is for the more experienced swimmers held in the deeper waters of the lagoon. His dolphin's name was Black and he was able to hug and kiss him. Black spun him around as he pushed his hand and took him on a belly ride across the lagoon. The price for the Encounter was AED 795 and the Adventure was AED 960 for guest who were not staying at the Atlantis Palm. The prices included admission into the Aquaventure Waterpark, so schedule your dolphin experiences early so that you will have time to take advantage of the waterpark that's open from 10am to sunset (approximately 6pm). Another tip is that if 2 or more of you are participating, book your programs separately so that you can take each others pictures as the souveneir pictures that will be sold by Dolphin Bay are quite expensive at AED 80. My husband and I both enjoyed our experiences and can't wait for our children to experience it also."

However I am not sure I can say the same for the poor dolphins:( When we arrived we were shocked to see 6 dolphins in a row with 10 people each. At our slot there were 4 dolphins with 10 people. I feel this is too many people for the trainers to ensure that people treat these magnificent animals with respect. There is a lot of sitting around waiting and queing and I felt guilty that I felt the animals were not enjoying the interaction. Our dolphin Amy had scratches on her face. I would like to think that all this money they are making that they are putting money back into some sort of rehabilitation programme. Think its probably better to just see them in the wild from a boat!"

Not cheap, but well worth it. Everyone in our group said their experience was amazing and something they would never forget. I read an earlier review encouraging people not to go here? The reviewer did not believe Dolphins should be kept in captivity - my question is, why on earth did you visit this place if that's how you felt?

Our dolphin was Lisa and she was such a star. - There are professional photographers taking photos of you all the time as you are not allowed to take a camera with you into the water (dangerous for the dolphins).You can collect (buy) your photos from their kiosk after you session. It isn't cheap but definitely worth it, and luckily you can also get your photos on a USB flash drive.- Afterwards they provide you with soft drinks and you can also stick around to watch the next session if you want.Tips: - When you book the Dolphin Experience you also get free entrance into the waterpark :)- Go early so that you can enjoy the whole day at the waterpark before or after your dolphin session.- Be on time for your dolphin experience, it just makes the whole experience perfect and relaxing.- There is a nice Starbucks at the Dolphin Bay area. Great for a light snack afterwards (their food is a little bit better than the other takeaway places on the premises). Enjoy :)"

Our instructors were really good with both the dolphins and the people taking part, they had a good sense of humour and we never felt rushed.I would say that if you are thinking of taking young children then ensure they are a good swimmer because the life jackets won't hold them up in the water and they are required to tread water for quite a while.The photos are obviously expensive but you don't have to buy them there and then if you are staying in the hotel. We got a few in a package with some of the other photos we had taken around the hotel and water park.My son especially couldn't stop grinning the whole time and now wants a dolphin for Christmas!"

We actually found it quite emotional because they are so intelligent and are happy to interact with you.As said in other reviews, the photos are expensive but what option do you have? Just take a deep breath and enjoy taking away your souvenir of a memorable experience. We thought the best value was the memory stick with every photo on it for 500 AED.One bonus is that your dolphin ticket allows you to enjoy the Atlantis water park for the day and it is a lovely place."

I was staying at the Atlantis and it had always been something I wanted to do, as Dolphin Bay was short walk away I booked up for the Dolphin Adventure.I came away from the whole experience feeling sad and ashamed. The dolphins are truly amazing, they are really are, but there was something unnatural about being with them in these man made surroundings where they trained to do tricks for fish.The staff and trainers at Dolphin Bay clearly care a lot for the dolphins enjoy their jobs. They do their best to make sure the experience is a memorable one but that didn't stop me from feeling like it was wrong.We have to stop buying tickets for these kind of experiences, as we are endorsing the captivity of these wild animals for our own pleasure and these corporation's financial gain. These animals should be left to live fulfilled lives in the wild. I apologise to Dolphin Bay for the negative review but I just cannot condone the captivity of these animals."

            "review": "Fantastic experience, worth the money!. My sister and I booked into the dolphin encounter in February and it was one of the best things we did while in Dubai. Yes it's expensive and it goes very fast but for the experience that you're getting, it's completely worth it. The staff are very friendly and informative and the dolphins are spectacular creatures. Our dolphin's name was Ini. You're in the water for about 30 minutes and have a few one on one interactions with your dolphin where a photographer is nearby taking professional pictures. The photos are expensive as would be expected but again, completely worth it. A good option is to get all of your pictures on a USB key for 500 dirham - this can work out cheaper than getting several of your favorite pictures printed and takes away the difficulty of having to choose.They supply you with towels, a choice of wetsuit or vest version which I found more comfortable and a choice of water/fizzy drinks.You get a free pass to the waterpark (which is great) when booking a dolphin encounter so it might be best to go early and then spend the rest of the day on the water slides to get good use out of it. You also have access to swimming pools and the beach which has a lovely view of the Dubai skyline.We got a taxi and our taxi driver knew where to go but for one who doesn't you can just ask for the palm atlantis and then take the right turn after the hotel entrance - there should be signs. You then need to walk in through huge doors that have a sign for a restaurant beside them and you'll find yourself beside a starbucks and other hotel shops. Keep following this hall around and you get to the entrance of the waterpark/dolphin bay."

We must of touched or handled (gently and respectfully of course) the beautiful creature more than a dozen times each and were able to see / feel the top and underneath coat and the flippers fins.

There is a bit of waiting around and quite a painful 'talk' once you are wet suited up. I would recommend a wet suit, you are given the option of just a vest but actually the water feels cold and that was the biggest challenge for my 4yr old. The dolphins are amazing and the trainers seem to be top of their game. Our negative experience was down to the photographers. The system for ordering prints was shocking and I would certainly recommend that if you can, divide and conquer, 40 mins of my life were lost in a queue with 2 fidgety boys! The photo packages look very fancy on the price list too but there is a basic memory stick one, which you get all the photos on so don't waste time watching some inefficient girl print your pics, take your stick and enjoy the rest of your day."

Everyone from the greeters to the trainers were polite and accommodating. The park itself was very clean and easy to get to with the golf carts taking you along the beach. Lockers and showers are right there after you peel off the provided wetsuits. We observed several other types of activities going on, but this swim is the best if you are a confident swimmer."

However the kid in me also came out and i too decided to do this with him. I have to say from start to finish it was a great experience and even for my son he said after he would like to do the Royal swim next and loved it all. On paper it seems expensive but there is a discount if you stay in the hotel. You also have access to the water park after. You have the option to wear a wet suit or just a wet suit jacket. Regardless of Dubai temperature the water remains at a constant 24C so can be very cold when you are sat in it for a while. Plenty of pictures taken but be prepared to spend (700AED - \u00a3130) because it will be hard to decide which to keep or which to get rid of. We opted for the 10 photos and the rest on a USB so we kept a record of the experience. Fantastic day. My suggestion would be to book a session in the morning. This way you have the rest of the day to enjoy the water park."

Almost everyone who experiences the wonder of swimming with a dolphin is going to want photos of their experience. These guys know this and screw you big time. I spent close to $250 on photos when the experience itself cost $300. NOTHING beats the feeling of hugging a dolphin, however I got the feeling while I was making new dolphin friends, management had their hands in my wallet taking money for a few pictures. Accept they should charge, but $35 to $50 for one picture?"

Pros- because we were a family of 4 we had our own private group with a dolphin to ourselves. Lots of fun getting to be so close to the dolphin and my boys really enjoyed it. Also we got some beautiful photos that their photographer took.Cons- super expensive and my little ones were full price even though my 1 year old was held by me the whole time(water too deep to stand)...I think it was around 6 or 700 euro for 1 hour. At least 30minutes of that time was spent in a presentation room learning about dolphins and the changing room getting in and out of the wetsuits. Btw water pretty chilly so I advise a wetsuit for a child rather than a life jacket. The photos afterward that you are of course going to buy if you paid for the experience are also a small fortune. If you have someone to be an 'observer' then they can take pics for you but it was just us so we felt inclined to buy. All in all a lovely experience for my boys but definitely an expensive one:)"

One of the most see attraction is the Dolphin pay. The chance to swim with Dolphin, touch, and being with him in the water is a great experience no one would miss it if living or visiting Dubai. They provide the special dress for this attraction. There are two areas for swimming with Dolphin, one is shallow and another one is deeper and you can chose. I chose the shallow one. The attraction starts with a group of attendees in the water with one dolphin a coach. The group plays with the dolphin and photos are taken all the time. At the end you can collect your photos in hard copy or all the photos on CD, both with extra charge which I think very expensive charge."

We have to admit it is very expensive, but you feel comfortable surrounded with very professional and friendly staff members to make sure the Dolphins and you are safe. The Dolphins seemed good and healthy to me, which means a lot, now they don't have a chance of swimming as free Dolphins in the Ocean.It was an amazing experience, and you could sense the staff very professionally checked us out - for instance to see if we could swim? Well done when we are in Deep Water. The staff kept an eye out for us the whole time, which we greatly appreciated.We had a ball and when we look at our photos, we can see how happy we all look one big smile.A good advise get one to take your photos from the beach - they cost an arm and leg!!!Uhhh.(However it is good photos).Greetings to the staff and dolphins from the two Danes and the Aussie"

You get that lovely gooey feeling that comes with interacting with such fabulous creatures in the sun. The only reason it lost the final 5th star is that \"check-in\" took far too long (Over 45 minutes until we were presented our wet suits) and the presentation prior to the event was weak. The slides were dated, we couldn't hear our presenter at the back of the room and the whole thing was frankly, quite boring. You'd be better off watching the dolphins from the sand.However, once you're out in the sun you forget that bit and enjoy the rest.

I opted for the group scuba experience packaged with the Aquaventure Park. I went early on a Friday morning (please not that Dubai's metro does not run on Friday mornings, so unless your hotel is close by, expect to pay a taxi quite a bit). I got there around 0700-0730 and because it was so early (and the taxi drive dropped me off at the wrong entrance to Atlantis) I was given several different directions before finally getting to Dolphin Bay. Once there I had no problems. I showed them my dive card (must have to do the dive experience) and then found out that I was the only one for the morning session!!! I was thrilled because I got the one-on-one experience for the price of a group dive! I was able to shake the dolphin's fin, feed her, get a kiss and get a ride/towed. I had a younger dolphin, Danita, who had a bit of a playful streak. The team took photos (purchased separately) and I walked away with great memories!"

We booked in for the shallow water experience as neither of us are great swimmers and we had a great time! We Were wet suited up and in groups of ten lead out to a shallow bay where we were met with a trainer and a dolphin. We were able to stroke, play and hug the dolphin and any family members or friends who did not wish to get in the water were allowed to watch on the beachside.  Plenty of photographs were taken ( all for a charge of cause. We paid 80 Aeds per pic) and all the wetsuit,towel and shower facilities were included. A must for dolphin lovers!"

There are a few different types of swims depending on your level of swimming expertise. I did the shallow water experience. The trainers are wonderful-they take every step to ensure your safety in the water. The experience starts with an orientation where you're acquainted with dolphins and their habits and then you go into the water. You're provided with a wetsuit but don't forget to carry your bathing suit to wear under it! Once you're in the water,you get a chance to dance,play,kiss and cuddle with the dolphin. It is an experience of a lifetime. Complimentary soft drinks are provided after the swim. Also,a professional photographer is at hand to click pictures of you throughout the experience. Mind you,the photos are a little expensive when you go to buy them. It's about 80 dirhams a piece. But they do have a few packages available from where you can choose the one best suited for you. One of the plus points is that the cost of the day pass for the Aquaventure Water Park is included in your swim cost. Observer passes cost extra. But all in all,it's definitely something worth experiencing."

The dolphin also did some jumps and showed us teeth etc. There was a good education session as well.

Be ready to fork out over $300 for the package of professional pics if you want them, so between our 2 \"adventures\" and the photo package it cost us close to $1k, however it was one of those things you do once in a lifetime and treasure the memories and the pics to show them. I LOVE the pics of it. I was disappointed to find out my dolphin was not \"rescued\" or \"bred in captivity\". They bought some from out in the Pacific, I think it's the Solomon Islands, and it was probably once wild. Having said that, if it stayed in the Solomon Islands they probably would be even worse off. They do seem very happy and cared for here and the handlers seem very good with them. All in all we had the most awesome day."

There is no doubt that the staff treat your safety with utmost respect and are extremely good, giving clear instructions. I did the Royal Swim which was expensive but allowed me to really interact with the Dolphins. All the tricks are controlled by giving treats, which is I guess how all animals are taught. It definitely took the wild away from the animal. The lagoon is a reasonable size but still seemed rather cramped. They are wonderful animals and the experience was good, but I think next time I will stick to watching them in the wild."

Only downsize was that the 30min in the water with the interaction with the dolphins was very quickly gone. Well run activity and when we arrived, we were given and introduction to the encounter and to the dolphin. Very useful presentation. Once in the water the two handlers where very enthusiastic and told us a lot about the dolphins. Close up pictures and a lot of cuddling of the animal. Once the encounter is over you can by some pricey pictures and remember this great day out, with such a great animal."

A warning however, the interaction is very limited, strictly controlled and not really \"swimming with the dolphins\". I would still highly recommend this experience. The trainers and dolphins are exceptional. The trainers are informative, communicative and nice both to visitors and to dolphins. They are highly professional and make the experience unforgettable for EVERY visitor. The dolphins are as you would expect it: intelligent, playful, they execute everything on cue. You also get the firm impression they are treated exceptionally well.While the expensive ticket for the experience may be justifiable, because it involves a lot of expenses both for staff and for dolphins (and they both earn their livelihood with excellent work), the price for photos (for security reasons you cannot take your own photos) is excessive. Unless you adore dolphin-shaped usb keys. Maybe you'd be able to team-up with the others from your group and select all the photos on one key and then copy them, but split the costs."

You can buy really good photos taken in the water and whilst they feel a little over priced its netted off by not paying to go and stand on the beach bit.

This is a very slick operation, there was 5 separate sessions going on in the time we were there, but you do not notice due to the layout of the bay. It is situated near the beach at The Atlantis. We booked in advance which is worth doing so you don't have to wait at the entrance, and I think if you book 14 days in advance you get a slight discount.The time in the water is 30 mins, but bear in mind you are in groups of ten so your time with the dolphin is not that long. My 3 and a half year old had fun, she is quite tall for her age and she was struggling to stand in the far end of the shallow area.Interaction with the dolphin includes a 'kiss', a 'hug' and playing by 'dancing' or 'throwing a toy', and they also come past the group numerous times and splash etc.It was very good fun to do once, and a nice experience for my daughter, but I would not do it again.Price isn't cheap however it does include access to the water park, which was great fun for all of us. I would recommend arriving as soon as the watermark opens, and staying all day."

My daughter was in a group of 4 for the Royal Swim, meaning that she got to chat to the instructors.There are not that many things you can do with a dolphin, but photo opportunity with kisses, hugs and dances was ok for my wife, and my daughter also had a dorsal pull by two dolphins, and a boogie board push.

We cannot write highly enough of the experience at Dolphin Bay, it really was excellent. After a brief introduction we were all given a choice of wet suit or wet jacket to get changed into before heading for a formal induction. Here we learnt a little about Dolphins, how they train them, what to expect when meeting them and also about the way they are looked after (excellently!). The actual experience was in a group of about 8 and we all had the chance to kiss, hug and play with the Dolphin. We also got group experiences where the guides could tell us more about them and also ask them to perform some 'tricks'! The only downside, if there had to be one, is that the cost of the photos at the end is very high but obviously you want them so have to pay what they ask (about \u00a3110 for 8 photos and a memory stick). They are great quality and well presented but still a lot to fork out ontop of the actual experience. However, it's worth every penny - an awesome experience (which also includes entry to the Aquaventure water park)."

Me and my partner wanted to do something special for our 3 year anniversary and being Dolphin lovers we opted to swim with the Dolphins at the Atlantis, having never done it before and being a once in a lifetime experience we thought now is the best time. The overall experience was nice and a memory I will cherish forever but would I do it again at the Atlantis? No. Reason being was because it was way too overpriced for what you actually got. We opted to do the Atlantis Dolphin Encounter where all the interaction happens in shallow water so you get to kiss, hug, dance and stroke the dolphin a couple of times. That programme alone came to 870AED- \u00a3147.00 PER PERSON! Paying that much money you would only have high expectations of what you're about to experience. Instead they combined us in groups of 6 which means if you do the maths each couple spends a maximum of 10 minutes with the dolphin which is so time consuming consideringyou only have 30 minutes! In 10 minutes you and your partner would have already kissed the dolphin, danced with the dolphin and had your pictures done at the same time. When your turn was up you would just watch the other two couples in your group do what you just did and whilst they was preparing the other couple to receive the dolphin you was given permission to stroke the dolphin. They say on the itinerary you get to hug the dolphin? We never did that. We also felt the whole experience was very restricted in a sense that you are instructed on what to do, most of the time it's like being told to touch the dolphins belly touch the back now touch the tail it pretty much goes like that for half the time. During the 30 minutes you also have to decide if you would like to dance or throw the hoop in the water for the dolphin to catch. At this point I thought wow we are paying \u00a3147 why can we not do both and actually experience some fun with the dolphin. See where I am coming from now? Whilst I understand it costs a lot of money to maintain and train the Dolphins, Atlantis is not being fair in limiting the time we spend with the dolphin. What was even more of a ripe off was the photos! Oh, my gosh! You would think for the price you are paying these pictures should look immaculate but they don't, as you can see from the pictures I have attached you can see all the other people in the background also interacting with the dolphin and that for me personally just kills the picture. The couple who was with us actually complained and said she has had friends who has done the programme and their pictures looked amazing with no one in the background the woman just responded 'I'm sorry madam but this is how the pictures are taken'. In the end we got four pictures and one of us together in a frame which came to 460AED which was around \u00a380. There are other photo packages there but be ready to spend. Also bear in mind that your dolphin ticket does include complimentary access to Aquaventure waterpark and their private beach. Whilst this was a nice experience I believe Atlantis should consider reducing the price of pictures and the encounter or allow people to actually spend more time with the dolphins because when they say 30 minutes you don't really enjoy 30 minutes of fun with the Dolphin. Maybe consider swimming with the dolphins at the dolphinarium in creekside park that looks to me as though you actually make the most of it and have fun. I hope this review was helpful."

We went for the Dolphin Adventure which was for almost 800 AED per person, so I had higher expectation on what we will get. Instead they combined us in groups of 6 and each one spent a very short time with the dolphins. I know it should not be very cheap and it costs a lot to have the amazing creatures safe and all but at least it should be worth the money. What was even more of a ripe off .. was the photos! After you finish they show you the photos taken and of course you want to take them all .. so you have to pay extra 500 AED (at least) to take them on a USB!!Again, it was a nice experience but I believe Atlantis should consider reducing the price or allowing people to spend more time with the dolphins. Oh and do something about the very expensive photos as well."

I did the shallow swim and lived hugging, dancing, playing and kissing the dolphin! I know there are other experiences they offer for higher prices like being pushed around the pool which I have done before. I just don't think it is worth it plus I don't think you get as close to these amazing animals.Only bad point was the cost of photos but that is more due to the classless penny pinching attitude of the Atlantis where Dolphin bay is situated.Would I recommend Dolphin Bay and/or come back again?

There were only five of us in my group and we took it in turns to be pulled by two dolphins through the water, then one dolphin put his nose on my foot and pushed me whilst I was on a board which was a wonderful feeling.

The Dolphin Bay is located at quite a distance from the Aquventure Waterpark - so kindly ensure that you reach on time.

The experience lasted for about 20 minutes and had about 10 people alongwith me. The dolphins are very well trained and you shall be entertained for the whole 30 minutes.Trust me, this is one place you wouldn't want to miss just in case you are visiting The Atlantis Hotel at Palm Jumeirah"

As others have mentioned, the Royal Swim is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination and whilst the ticket does include 'free' entrance to the Aquaventure Water Park, you cannot use/eat at the outlets at The Atlantis The Palm - they stop you as it is for residents only. Needless to say, this leaves very few and over-priced food outlets for you to use.But the dolphin experience blows all negative thoughts away and being in close proximity with the dolphinss really does seem to be as therapeutic as people say.Quick 15 minute instruction and then about 30 minutes in the water with the dolphins and groups are kept to 4 or 5 people and so you do get some quality time with the dolphins.All of the instructors are friendly, jovial and seem to adore their charges and we would definitely do this again and would recommend this to anyone considering it."

This is a very cool experience to be up close and touch a dolphin if you have never done so. However, it really is only a short amount of time you have with the dolphins while you are in groups. To make this whole attraction worthwhile and store your memories, you should purchase the professional pictures shot by their photographers. Given we were in different sessions, they wouldn't let us purchase the 650 AED USB package, but upsold us to the 850 AED package with USB, poster and 10 prints. Of course, we went with the more expensive option, didn't mind as we understand it is costly to run a dolphin habitat. Make sure you allocate enough time to use the water park after as it's included in the price of the dolphin activity."

Having paid close to \u00a3200 for a dolphin experience I learn that we have to pay either \u00a38 or \u00a313 for a locker in the water park. This fee is NON REFUNDABLE and its the same for all visitors to the water park. I find it very unpleasant that any water park charges for storage facilities, it should be provided and included as part of the cost of the entry ticket. A large family would easily need 3 or 4 large lockers costing close to \u00a350 which is a joke. People need a place to put their stuff, did you not expect that??? Stop it please.Pictures from the dolphin experience > well what can I say. If I had realised beforehand the costs of these items I may well have hired a photographer for the day as it would probably work out cheaper. \u00a383 yes \u00a383 for a 2GB usb stick with a few images on! And that was one of the cheaper options! Far too expensive and you guys are being too greedy in this area. How about trying a new business model = charge much less and more people will buy stuff?

Five exercises done with dolphin - suits and vests keep you afloat - so don't worry about the deep water ! Photographer makes sure pics are taken of each exercise.

This is an educational and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get up-close to these exquisite and elegant creatures, whilst learning more about them from Sea Lion Point's friendly and informative staff. Some may consider the 595 dirhams pricey given that visitors receive only 30 minutes of the interaction in the water with a resident sea lion; however, the overall experience is excellent. Visitors can expect all equipment (wet suits, towels and lockers) to be provided along with a cold drink at the end of the interaction. Photography is not permitted by visitors; however, a professional photographer is present and visitors can choose, without any pressure, to purchase photographs or photograph packages. Admittance to Aqavenuture waterpark is also included in the price of the interaction making this a fun day out for all ages."

As a spectator you didn't get to see much but I didn't mind as we paid for me to go to the Atlantis Water park after. The person doing the dolphin experience gets free entry into the water park. I purchased it online before our holiday and it was much cheaper. I would avoid going there on a Friday and Saturday if you can as it's really busy - we made that mistake! You get to purchase a lovely photographic memento after the encounter which we felt was reasonably priced. We would definitely do this again when we are in Dubai next and possibly take our 3yr old this time."

I felt like a 5 years old child... just couldn't stop laughing! :) There are three options of experience, we had the Atlantis Dolphin Adventure. The entire interaction takes place in deep water, but you don't need to be a great swimmer (i'm not!), just have to be able to tread water (and the clothes you'll put on will also help you with that). There are 6 guests per dolphin and you stay 30 minutes in the water. It was so much fun! Not cheap, but totally worth the money. You can't take any cameras to the pool area, but there's a professional photographer taking pictures so you can buy later. One bad thing: even though we had already bought our tickets on the website, we had to stand in a long line to get our access into the park."

One parent go in the water with the kids while the other stays on the shore to take pictures. Dolphin Bay has a photographer taking pictures from the shore and they do a great job - we bought the DVD of all the pictures involving us. It's expensive! The parent on the shore has just as good a photo shoot as the employee - need to have a telephoto. When it comes time to kiss the dolphin, it's only natural to be looking at the dolphin - don't. Instead, smile and look at the shore so the picture will show you with a great smile with close up of the dolphin right beside your face."

All of them quite expensive, specially for couples or family groups.We took the lowest price program (300$ for 2 person) which was about one kiss and one dance with dolphin only. But this is for not swimmers or families with kids. Groups are 10 people each one for 1 dolphin. So generally it is about to wait standing in a very cold water while other 9 people are doing what you've just done. And don't think you will make lots of photos yourself. They have a photographer for each group and then sell you photo they've made for 80 AED each one printed. To get them all electronic will cost you fortune.The good point is: for that price you also have opportunity to stay the whole day in aqua park there and enjoy beach and other attractions which are very exciting.They also tried to make program not a waiting boring queue by adding some information about dolphins while you are waiting. It was a great experience generally but too little for high price and not much wow memories left afterwards...specially after trying all extremal attractions in the Aquaventure.If you are not a family with kids try a royal swimming or diving with dolphins better."

You have to wear a wetsuit, which might deter some people, but we had some very large people who were easily accommodated by the staff. They separated the group into 4 groups of six. There were 4 dolphins. Tina was the name of our dolphin and she was beautiful. Each person in the group got to do the following individually (professional photographer on hand)- We started with a dolphin swim. I floated in the deep and 2 dolphins came up beside me and I grabbed their fins and they pulled me to shore. Wow. We then got to hold and pat the dolphin Tina. More photos. She then kissed us on the cheek in the deep water. We swam out individually again and one by one she approached us for a kiss. Obviously, she knew that we loved her as she kissed me forever and she nibbled hubby's ear! Then hugs. We had to swim out one by one and hold arms out. Tina swam up to me and I hugged her and kissed under her face! I fell - luckily away from her because she didn't seem to want to swim away! Brilliant. Finally we went out to the trainer one by one with a bodyboard and he set up and dolphin push. Lying on the board with one leg outstretched and the other foot tucked into the knee, Tina came up behind me and her nose on my foot, she powered me through the water to the beach - wow. It was the trainee version of the push that you see in the dolphin shows. Okay, so it was expensive ($275 AU each) - but what price would you put on this experience if you could do it? It was breath taking. The trainers were brilliant and the dolphin interactions were just perfect. The only down side was the first 30 minutes were a pretty useless powerpoint in a large room with a huge group of people. Incidentally, some groups had a person with an observer pass who paid less to get the privilege to stand on the beach and take photos (but missed out on swimming with dolphins). The professional photos at the end are quite expensive and we got all of ours on a USB rather than getting hard copies as they are a bit difficult on holidays and there are so many sites online where you can order prints when you get home."

You get to stroke, dance and hold the dolphin as well as kiss them. No cameras are allowed but you can purchase the pictures afterwards which are good quality and reasonably priced.The experience lasts around an hour and you get access to a free locker.

Husband wishes he had done it instead of watching, we will go back. By no means cheap, very expensive but hopefully it represents the cost of the care and experts involved.

Till recent, we hadn't had the chance to experience them up close and booked in for a shallow encounter at the Atlantis on this trip to Dubai. We apologise for forgetting our instructor's names, but they were extremely friendly and informative, particularly the Australian photographer who turned to instructing dolphins; we had a good discussion throughout the encounter regarding all aspects of dolphins and their lives at Atlantis. The spotlight of the encounter was a darling female dolphin named Inni, who was gorgeous, with a rich aura. The beautiful thing was communicating first hand with us, and exhaled via blowhole when near. While the rest of the group chose to dance with the dolphin, I took to throwing a ring, which went slightly farther than desired. She got the ring and swam back, and I managed to look at her while gently removing the ring from around her neck. We then had a kiss and hug session, which was was just divine. The other dolphin, S2, was jubilant, and when the two starting playing in the water, S2 displayed alot more moves than Inni, who seemed a bit shy. Photos....expensive!! We got the USB, which turned out the most economical. It would be good if they would allow us head mounted water proof cameras in the dolphin bay. To conclude, an excellent experience, and will return for the deep water encounter next."

The instructors give you a history of the dolphins and instruct us how to behave around the dolphins. Lockers are available and you change into wet suits. There were three dolphins in the lagoon. The instructors gave us a lesson on what to do while in the water with the dolphins..At one point two dolphins came up to each of us, one dolphin on each side. You then grabbed hold of the dorsal fins and off you went - being pulled through the water by dolphins. Another time, we held onto a Styrofoam surf board, straightened out our right let. A dolphin then came up and pushed us through the water with his nose pushing on our foot. Great experience. There were around nine in our group that morning and all had fun. Pictures were taken during the outing and available for purchase afterward. The cost of Dolphin Bay also got you into the water park. This is not a lazy river type water park. They have an abundance of different 'rivers', some with rapids up to class three along with many rides going through chutes. It was a great way to cool off. Places to eat were also available, as were rental lockers."

But what a day, the staff throughout the park, especially around the dolphins were fantastic. Everything is run like clockwork, and although very commercial it is also quite intimate. We were put with another family of 6 so the 10 of us 'shared' a dolphin (Lily) for the Dolphin encounter package. We all got to have lots of photos taken by the in house photographer, both individually and as a family group.We purchased a memory stick with all the pictures on for 500 Dhms (\u00a380) and would recommend this is the best way to do it. However had I known that all the pictures taken in the water park later in the day could be added to for the same price I would have been a lot happier with the price.We visited on a Monday in February and the park was busy but not packed, although all the sunbeds were taken quite early. The lockers are next to useless so I would recommend that you travel light, food and drink was reasonably priced (for the most expensive city in the world).As I say a great day out, my daughters (6 and 8) loved every minute, although there is little to do in the water park for the youngest (just under the 120cm limit for most of the good slides)Word of warning, the taxi queues are huge at the end of the day, and the fixed price hotel taxis are half as much again as the city cabs."

In principle a very nice experience and certainly a most welcome Christmas present which we certainly enjoyed apart from ...Royal Swim or \"Royal Rip Off\"? First they don't allow you to photograph yourself as the \"Dolphins could swallow the camera\" if you take it into the water, then they advise they have \"professional photographers\", finally they present the images they made in packages from EUR 100 to all the way fancy packages of EUR 500 and even more. When you ask for details you get vague answers, no one knows. Asking for the resolution you get directed to a ~A1 or A2 size frame on the wall in good quality. Opening the USB stick at home you realise the Royal Swim is a \"Royal Rip Off\" for mediocre 1.6MB jpeg files.... This after paying approx EUR 400 for the experience for two. Bottom line, prefer to spend double and triple but see the animals healthy out in the open sea even if you don't get as close...On a positive note. The South African counter staff was very helpful with the \"expired voucher\" that didn't carry a date so one could realise that ...after the 3 colleagues making the reservation based on an e-mailed copy of the voucher failed to do so."

The program is well set up but at the same time you feel like you're being processed through a series of stations, poses and activities. I guess there needs to be some structure to these things but overall felt like we were just the 10:30 group being herded through. Photos where nice to have at the end but again, expensive. Once you have made the investment in the experience, you kinda feel compelled to document it with a photo.

But we hated the pre and post experiences at the Atlantis Resort. The dolphin de-brief by so called dolphin expert was a joke. Not only could he not operate \"Powerpoint\"; he prolonged the suffering by making pointless jokes. Basically, a 5 mins presentation got dragged on for 15mins. Luckily his supervisor stepped in and took us to the Scuba team.The scuba diving team was spot on! Very professional and patient. We were newly Open water certified. Accordingly, buoyancy was still a work in progress. The team gently helped us out. Once we got the hang out it; the dolphin and her trainer were showing us tricks after tricks. It was a surreal experience.Once out of the water; the poor rating continues. One would think for AED1400 per person, one would have a decent changing and showering facility. Not expecting a five star treatment; but since it was at the Atlantis resort, we expected something better. The change room and showering facility were separated by a common public area. And the showering facility is pretty low class. The package also allowed us to the water park. But because of different venues, we needed to transfer our personal content from the Dolphin Bay lockers to the Water Park lockers...which was not a big deal. But looking for the new lockers were an adventure all in itself. The water park staffs were completely clueless. They kept pointing their fingers to the direction of the lockers but without actually knowing where they were. After 5 mins of the following the fingers with several staffs; we confronted a staff and asked him to physically escorted us to them. Being led back to the front gate, we realized we were in a sea of chaos! There were hundreds of people lining up for tickets and lockers. We decided it was not worth the trouble.Now we were ready to leave by taxi back to the hotel that we were staying. You'd think looking for the lockers in the water park was fun...well, not getting fooled by official Atlantis Taxi agents was the farewell game here. These agents kept pushing for the limo rather than taxi. As it turns out, the limo's metres jump 2x - 3x faster than the regular taxi. Basically, the dolphin experience was great; but don't use any other facilities. So what does that say about the actual Atlantis Resort? I won't know and I don't really care."

You have the opportunity to observe, touch and interact with beautiful dolphins in their own habitats, which was a first for me and my fiancee (who had always wanted to do something like this).For small children and those who can't or don't want to go swimming, there is a shallow pool in which you can stand and interact with the dolphins. There are deeper pools and more in-depth experiences for those with more advanced swimming skills, so there are opportunities for every member of the family to spend time with the dolphins. You can even scuba dive with them if you want to, although we did not do this to keep the cost down. The cost of Dolphin Bay is a little bit high, but avoiding some of the extras is a good way to cut costs. Plus, your ticket comes with admission to the Aquaventure Waterpark, which is a lot of fun on its own. All in all, this marine park is well worth the price if you love sea life / dolphins or are just looking for something different to do in Dubai."

Before you enter the water a guide tells you all about the animals and really gets you in the mood! You get to dance/play/kiss/hold/stroke the dolphins - who are absolutely gorgeous!

The experience was amazing, small groups, friendly trainers and great facilities make it all the better. You feel like you get a personal experience and you get a lot longer with the dolphins than many other places offer. Photos were not too expensive either, we chose a package of 4 prints and all the photos on disc (53 photos) for about \u00a380. This was much better value than 1 photo for about \u00a315. We also received free entry to the waterpark after which we thoroughly enjoyed, and a discounted entry to the aquarium. I would recommend the early times for dolphins, we started at 9:10am, it is a lot less hectic than arriving later in the day once the waterpark is open and queues were a lot larger."

After seeing the pictures from Taji in Japan where yearly hundreds of dolphins are killed, while the most beautiful ones are selected for delphin shows around the world, I was worried.After some emails and beeing assured that non of there dolphins came from Taji I deceided to give it a try. Booked for the Royal Swim, which included beeing pulled by 2 dolphins and a foot push.After checking in and signing the paperwork, you get your wetsuit and get changed. After they take you to a \"classroom\" where they tell you how they train and treat the dolphins and what to do and especially not to do in the water.Once in the water, 2 trainers took care of our group of 6 and the one dolphin. All the time you can ask questions and the trainer continuously reassure that you are fine and enjoying.Once the half an hour is over, which unfortuneately happens way too quick, refreshment drinks are offered and you can shower in the locker area.Very positive, with your Dolphin Bay pass, you can enjoy the waterpark next door for the rest of the day as well.During your in-water experience, some photographers are around and taking pictures of you. You can buy them before leaving the bay area For me, they are way too expensive, 1 single picture costs 80 AED, if you want all picutres of your sessions on a stick, we are talking about 500 AED or more. I would have bought more picture, if they would be priced more reasonable. You can bring an observer to your experience for only 100 AED (haggle with the cashier possible, we got him down from 300 to 100), the observer can then take pictures from the beach of the bay. Like this you can get more pictures for a reasonale price. Make sure you bring a camera with a good zoom lens, as the beach is stil a few meter away, especially for the deep water stuff.It's not a cheap attraction but worth the money, but I hope the rethink their pictures pricings."

Yes a bit cheesy....but what the heck!! Loved it!! There are loads of towels available and complementary drinks after. Yes we bought the photos.....how could you not!! It is NOT a cheap morning out!!

Then my daughter got bored and walked back out. The photo the professionals took were great so for AED600 we got all photos on a USB stick. I personally didn't think much of it but then that's nobody's fault. It is what it is. Not sure if it's worth all that money, I paid AED830 per person.

You get a lot of time with your dolphin and it is very humbling to be in the presence of this amazing mammal.We had Alice and she was beautiful! We got spinned around, got kisses, hugs, kissed back, had a water fight and got a belly ride.Pictures that the photographers took are available to purchase. All pictures on a USB for 500 AED (around 52 pictures on me and my friend) is a lot of money and personally I would have appreciated if the quality of the pictures were better. If you're a normal visitor with no photographic skills the pictures are fine.All in all we spent approximately 1400 AED per person for the whole day with traveling to and from by taxi, food, activities (Aquaventure + Dolphin Bay), photos at Dolphin Bay, souvenirs etc. It might sound like a lot but I wouldn't think twice if I had the chance to do it again.Special thank you to all the dolphin trainers. You have a lot of passion for what you do and it is easy to see the connection and joy you have caring for the dolphins. I am jealous and now strongly considering a career change."

And I only did that to take some pics. However, you can buy all the photos for about \u00a360 which are excellent quality!! Having paid - this also gives you access to the Aquapark, which I didn't use!!So, be VERY careful how you spend your money!!!NB!!!! On leaving the park, we waited an hour for a taxi, and because the Hotel was calling them the starting charge was more and DON'T!!! forget.......different type of taxis cost more!!So, DON'T just jump in the next car, check the price first!!ALL this makes for a very long wait, not very efficient at all!!We were told taxis were cheap.......if someone tells you this, ask them to define cheap...they aren't!! Also, my partner is hearing impaired and we informed the staff. Their understanding of this was to shout at him, as I could hear them from the shoreline but he still couldn't.I think if anyone has a disability of ANY sorts they should investigate how the event caerers for this.The staff are nice enough and were good with him, but I could see their paience wearing with him.They definitely need more training!!"

Words can't describe the feeling when you touch,kiss,hug or play with them. You need to try this! Book in advance and you will save some money AED 50 (I think it is minimum of 2 weeks in advance) and book as early term you can (9.10 AM Royal Swim) because you need to have time for Aquaventure Waterpark afterwords (The entrance for the Waterpark is free of charge when you buy any of the Dolphin swimm and you get 25% off same day admission to The Lost Chambers Aquarium if you want to go there). We had Royal swim and it was so much fun when dolphin pushes you through the water (foot push). I was laughing so hard and screaming of joy. It is even more amazin when two dolphins drag you through the water. The cutest part was hugging and kissing the dolphin. Amazing feeling! You can't take pictures on your own. You can buy them afterwards. They are too pricey but they are a memory on this special event so I think it is worth to have them. (if you don't want to swim with dolphins you need to buy observation pass and then you can take pictures from the coast of you family and friends. The whole experience is very well organised. And the trainers are kind and cary and you can see how much they love the dolphins and also how much dolphins love them. The whole experience lasts around 30 min and there are 6 of you in the same group. There is also 15 minute orientation with a Marine Mammal Specialist before going into the water. I truly recommend this magical experience! It is a little bit pricey but the memory will last forever!"

However the absolute best was the boogie ride and the ride between the two dolphins across the lagoon.The staff are really friendly and good at their jobs. They genuinely care about the dolphins and seems to love their work. Lockers, towels and wetsuits are provided as well as refreshments (a can of pop or water). Photographs must be purchased separately at the end of your encounter. I did not do this since I did not find the photos very good and my family had taken better photos with my own camera from the shore. However the rest of the family bought one photo since I had not been able to take photos of them since their time was during my introduction. I have always dreamed about swimming with Dolphins and am so glad that we had this experience while being in Duabi. It is pricey, yes, but so worth the money."

I do feel however that it should be cheaper. Was too expensive!Finally what really put me off was that the photos taken by the resort's \"professional photographer\" were awful. Extremely bad quality and lighting and only about 7 photos each to choose from. And the cost was extreme. 100\u20ac for a usb with the photos (even if it's just the 7!) was the cheapest package. We only ordered 2 photo printouts at 16\u20ac each which is till too much but you must have something to remember it... We did have an underwater camera which my husband could hold while i was the dolphin and vice versa but they didn't allow us to take it in for the dolphin's security, which is just another money machine for them."

It was such a great experience from beginning to end!When you arrive to Dolphin Bay, a representative checks you in an tells you what time to congregate in a designated location to begin the tour. They take you inside where they size you and suit you up in a wetsuit and vest for the time you will be swimming. Once you are done there, you go into a small theater where you watch a short film about dolphins and your upcoming interaction.After the video, you are introduced to the dolphin trainers that will be assisting you for the experience. The ones we had were all extremely enthusiastic and loved what they did! Then, after that, you will introduce yourself and family and tell them where you are from. the trainers then will explain the signs you will use in the pool to indicate the positions you need to be in to effectively communicate with the dolphins.Once finished, you all go out to the pool and spend about an hour with the dolphins. You will get to hug them, kiss them, hold them and get towed by them. This activity seems to be very generic. Many people do this on vacation to exotic/tropical destinations. I cannot speak for other facilities, but this one is top notch. Kudos to Dolphin Bay!"

The dolphins are well trained and seem happy, which is important. There is a professional photographer which takes photos available to purchase, they are also very expensive but definitely worth it as they are good quality.

I stayed back with the baby while my 5 year old went for the photo fun with my husband. My daughter was so excited after the course and excitedly shared every details with me. She liked it so much to rank it the \"best part of the vacation\". I had never seen her happier, that made it worth every penny.I was hoping to take pictures while on the beach but the course is conducted a bit too far to able to get good shots, so we had to rely on the pictures taken by the official photographer. The pictures were nice and you could buy the whole bunch on a usb device. Again expensive but souvenir to cherish.the fee for the dolphin bay gives you access to he water park, so you could spare the whole day for the park.We look forward to do the \"dolphin encounter\" course for the family when the little one grows up, on our next trip."

We booked the royal swim through the website and got a small discount.I was doubtful and scared that we are entering a facility where the dolphins are used only for earning money without any care and that I would regret this purchase.I'm glad I was wrong!Lets start from the beginning.We arrived at the Atlantis about two hours prior to our scheduled swim and we got help from this lovely lady who told us how we get to dolphin bay and gave us information about the waterpark and a map over the huge area.We took a walk and looked around and found the buggy station were we got a ride to dolphin bay.At arrival to the dolphin bay we went up to the man infront of the reception entrance and he looked at our reservation and gave us a beeper and told us to come to him when it beeps.We waited and finally the beeper started buzzing.We went in to the reception area were we got tickets to wetsuits and signed a release form.The lovely guides showed us to the orientation area were we got our wetsuits and information on how to use the lockers.When ready we went inside the orientation room were one of the Dolphin trainers gave us information on the dolphins and how they are trained. I was so happy to learn that dolphins are trained in a similar way as dogs when they are clicker trained. This means...Only positive reinforcement and the only punishment is that the trainers only ignore them if they do wrong.We were advised not to touch the dolphins until the trainer approved. For the dolphins safety we were not allowed to wear jewellery or hairbands. I was so happy that they really care for the dolphins and that the enviroment is safe and relaxed for the dolphins.After the information we got divided into three groups.We had a large family who wanted to go together so our group included me my boyfriend and one other girl. We were three people total. All groups went to the water and we met the dolphins.It was amazing. It felt like time stopped and I could have stared att these beautiful creatures forever. It was a memorable day and even if it was expensive to buy the photos it was worth it for me. And I will remember this day forever.We bought the usb with all the photos and it was about 75 pictures total of me and my boyfriend and some of dolphin bay and a few group pictures for 500dirhamI truly recommend the royal swim for the ones who knows how to swim and want to feel the power of the dolphins.We were at aquaventure and dolphin bay on a monday so I guess it was a good day since it was not so crowded as I had expected."

I have previously swam with Dolphins so know what to expect and we agreed that my husband would accompany her and I would be an 'observer' on the beach.Everything is organised in a very professional way - as is expected in Dubai and also to reflect the cost involved. We arrived around 30 mins early for our encounter and were given a bleeper so that we could return at the allocated time.At that time, we were ushered with many other people to the 'wetsuit' chat, this was fine, the changing facilities were not, way too small, it was worse than being at school swimming lessons!. OK, so its busy around the new year period, but somewhere such as Atlantis should make provision for this. Consequently my daughter put on her wetsuit in the foyer area as it was impossible to find a space in the small changing area.Following this we moved to another room for the 'orientation', this was very informative and very well presented. It was somewhat marred by other nationalities talking over the presentation, (on several occasions both ourselves and others had to 'shush' people so that we could hear the information and presentation. I'm not sure how you overcome such issues, very difficult with certain nationalities!)....Then on to what everyone was waiting for, the dolphins were great, lots of interaction and a full 30 minutes in the water, (temperature of the water is 21 degs centigrade, it's a little cold in December and even with a shortie wetsuit our daughter was shivering!).Then back to the changing rooms mayhem and a complimentary soft drink.If you purchase the 'observer' package then be warned that its quite difficult to take photos as the official photographer is in the way ALL the time!, therefore not that good for your photo opportunities - clearly a ploy so that you have to buy the official photos which are not very good and are expensive!....AED80 (\u00a316) for 1 photo, size 9X6\" in a presentation folder is the entry price level, there are various option including saved to memory stick which is a good and convenient way to take your photos home.maybe in hindsight we should have mentioned to the official guy to ensure that we got good photos, but have read other reviews where this has also been highlighted as an issue...Our package included access to the water park, this was great but on a cloudy day in December a little cold, would love to return on a warmer and less crowded day in future.Overall, if you want to take your family to see and interact with Dolphins then I would recommend this, but please realise that its not a natural environment for Dolphins and is clearly a big money making machine - our allocated time was in a group of 10 people (each group gets their own dolphin) and there were 6 groups, so 60 people in the water at one time...."

For kids it is great to see and touch the dolphins but is is a tourist machine: 7-10 people per dolphin, everything controlled from your beeper to inform you, you can go and change to moving in and out of the water. It's all to protect the dolphins from stupid people, I can understand but it makes everything so fake. Maybe I am spoiled since I swam with dolphins in more open water where you could play with the dolphins yourself.It already started with some chap doing the intro and making us yell 'goodmorning'.......TWICE because it needed to be louder.You are not allowed to take pictures, only if you are a bystander of you remove yourself from the water. So be aware, if you want to take pictures of your kids, have one go in the water and the other one be an observer and take pictures from the beach. Otherwise you will have to buy copies of your pictures or a USB stick costing 80AED per print or 500AED for a USB on top of the not to cheap entrance fee.....Our son loved it and thought it was great thoughAnd be aware the changing rooms are shared so put your swimming gear on at home or somewhere else unless you do not mind showing everything to your fellow dolphin swimmers. (There is a seperate room for males and females.)If you like waterparks, you can access the waterpark all day with your dolphin ticket and you get to use the dolphin bay big towels for the day.

We chose the most expensive package but I wish there was higher packages that could give a more personalised free form experience and longer contact time with the animal. It's a well oiled money machine and during the experience if felt quite rushed. They certainly churn through the groups. I thought the trainers excellent and very friendly and had us in shocked giggles when asked by a younger person \"What happens when they get old, do they get released\" - \"No, they will work here here until they die\" ahhh welcome to the Gulf ;-) The facilities excellent. If you are a couple like us, split your tours so the other one can take pictures from the beach. When combined with the waterpark an awesome day out, one of the best in Dubai. It didn't exactly live up to my dreams but don't let that stop you giving it a go, it's not every day you swim with a dolphin!"

We had individual time with a bottle nose dolphin and were guided through a range of activities with the dolphin called 'Central' who was beautiful. We danced, hugged, kissed, got spun round in the water and swam holding onto the dolphins fins. A very memorable day and one we will never forget. The dolphin complex was huge and spectacular. We were all in a very small group and the trainer and guide were friendly, helpful and informative. The experience didn't feel rushed.We have two amazing photographs that we will treasure forever. I am so glad we did this in Dubai in the best dolphin complex in the world.Not suitable for small children and weak swimmers as you need to tread water for 30 minutes.

We really appreciated the effort of the trainers we swam with! It is well organized and the staff is very knowledgeable and professional. All in all it was amazing!!"

It is always great watching the magnificent dolphins from across range. Last week on a business week in Dubai with colleagues, we had a day to spare so we decided to go for a Dolphin photo adventure, and it was really awesome. We spent some time at the dolphin lagoon taking photos and I can\u2019t lie that I have seen dolphins this close. They say that if you got to Atlantis you can swim with the dolphins and sure that is not a lie. I dint have the courage to get that close, but some of my colleagues did have a day with the dolphin. I am thinking of bring my two boys next year."

Yes, a little expensive but it's worth it! When you have the opportunity to swim with dolphins in such close proximity? Instructors are very friendly, explain you everything you need to know how to behave with the dolphins as you can touch and that can not be touched :)Trying to learn more about you! Many jokes! Even try to talk to you in your native language :) Create a very pleasant atmosphere :) Ask you to be a good swimmer, but I think it's not so important, because the water is so salty, can support you well enough :) I am very poor swimmer, but I was so simple to tread water :) We chose the Atlantis Royal Swim! Was pretty cool!!! Dolphins are so tender creature, so friendly that you do not want to leave the bay, after communicating with them, and the time spent there will seem too short!!! Want to give advice about shooting! If you go there is not one, if you have a partner, if you have a good camera and someone will be able to take pictures of the beach, better do yourself. And take a swim at different times, such as one at 14-00 and another at 15-00 ... to be able to take pictures of each other! You will not be allowed in the water with the camera, just off the beach, which is a few meters from swimming and shallow water very close! Photos are not of very high quality but very expensive! At such prices photographer could do much better pictures! I say this because very often use the services of photographers and know it! Stunning place! Very touching communication :) Unforgettable memories for a lifetime! I highly recommend!!! Thanks for every one from this place!!! Specialy to Dolphin Cathy :)"

All details are well taken care of, including clean towels, refreshments and a quality coffee shop at the entrance while waiting for one's turn. The family members and friends who do not participate have \"prime seating\" to watch, take pictures and enjoy from a comfortable distance.The only slightly unpleasant surprise is the water temperature. As the dolphins enjoy a rather colder water than most people and in Dubai is generally hot, the water temperature might surprise you a little. Come prepared, at least psychologically for this aspect.

Swimming with dolphins was on my 'bucket list' so I decided to go for it, my partner however was discouraged by the website which advised you needed to be able to tread water for up to 15 mins and a strong swimmer so opted for the observer pass instead. The whole attraction was well organised with ample staff and we were escorted from one section to another. The briefing was comprehensive and the tutor was enthusiastic and polite - even when other guests we being rude chatting amongst themselves.For the Royal Swim we were provided with wetsuits and a neoprene vest which assisted our buoyancy. As a group we stroked the dolphin then individually had a kiss and a cuddle, dorsal tow and were pushed on a boogie board. The group of six was the perfect size and the experience still felt personal. In between the activities there were ledges in the water to stand on so you only really needed to swim very short distances. I was disappointed as had we known this previously my partner would have booked to do the Royal Swim with me and it would have been lovely to have that as a shared experience. Even the staff said they were baffled re the '15 minute' clause which tainted the afternoon somewhat as anyone who can swim would manage easily.As was to be expected the photos came with a hefty price tag (\u00a313 each) I felt compelled to buy one as it was a once in a lifetime experience. All in all expensive but worth it."

You don't have any 'free' time or swim with dolphin, you just listen to the trainer and dolphin does some tricks with you and 5 other from the group, and that's basically it, but still it was wonderful to interact on any way with those smart and magnificent creatures. You can take photos as you wish, just filming is forbidden, but bottom line is, nobody is checking if you are filming or taking photographs.. Water park, and beach and whole area is great!

It Is what commercial, yes but it is great. Let me give some practical info if you want to do this, i recommend you do.First book in advance(you get a discount when booking 15 days in advance of 50 UAD per person, see the site of Atlantis the palm), it is rather long waiting to buy tickets once inside.Print your ticket before you go.Dolphin bay is located in the park Aquaventure, so if you book the Dolphins you get automatically acces to the park.The entrance of the Dolphin bay is at the hotel Atlantis the palm, but take the entrance marked \"Avenues\" it is not the main hotel entrance but it is the next one, if you see the parking for Aquaventure park you are too far.If you come by car there is valet parking wich is charged 150 UAD, but that if you buy food and drinks(only food no other stuff ) for that amount you don't pay the ticket.You have to ask a stamp(on the receipt) each time you buy food so they can verify, ask for it , it is not done automatically.If you come by taxi remember that when leaving in the afternoon it gets busy and there are not enough taxis, so you will have to wait for quite some time(when i was leaving the park at at 5 pm, there where about 50 people waiting). A car or the monorail(metro) is a better option(the monorail stops ath the entrance to the Avenues and the aquaventure park.Ok make your way to the avenues (shops and shops) and take the first \"street\" on your left(look up and you see Doplhins as decoration in the lamps).At the entrance (wich is the same entrance as for the Aquaventura waterpark) go to the right desk and show your ticket.You get a wristband wich says\"collect your photo's with this wristband\" in red.this is for the entrance only!You will have to buy an adittional wristband for the lockers same thing but yellow letters at the price of 40 UAD for a small locker.Bigger lockers are available but more expensive.The small locker is small ok if you are two but for family take the bigger on. The work with the barcode on the wristband fully automated.You scan them in the changing room it is easy.Locker rooms are just as you go inside the park entrance at your left.There are toilets and showers available in the locker room but towels you take inside the park when you leave.I advice to take a locker put on the bading suits and leaving your stuff there. You don't need towels, you will get them at Doplhin bay as well as water or soda drinks, you will need money for buying food and photo's later on!There is a locker available at the Dolphin bay but once you leave there you have to free your locker, and it is quite along walk from the entrance up to the Dolphins.Ok, go to Doplhin bay located at the end of the park. Just past the entrance of the aquaventure park take right you will find \"Golf buggy's\" they will carry you all the way to Dolphin bay.At the entrance of Dolphin bay present yourself to the person behind the \"desk\", you get a sort of buzzer that will go of when it is time to go in.Inside first some explanation about the animals and what to do and what not.Ok time to put on the swimsuits as the water of Dolphin bay is 25\u00b0 C you have the option between a vest only and a suit with( short legged).Take the suit the water is rather chilly since the outside temp is high it feels so.Taking photo's is not allowed inside Dolphin bay in the water nor filming but if you can buy seperate tickets for some to go on the beach and take photo's(see the website for prices).There are photographers in the water and they take your photo's.I have to say this all very professional (camera's are Canon 7D) and the photo's are great!You can buy the photo's in the shop next door, you will see different options and prices.I took the simple USB(this is not the Dophin shaped one) stick priced at 500 UAD(is the least expensive option), expensive yes! But perfect pictures and plenty of them(for my familyof 5 around 90 photo's). so i advice to take this option. Note that it takes 15 minutes to get your photo's.As i said taking photo's with your own camera is allowed but not in the water only from the beach, so that means that someone of your party can not go in the watre with the Dolphines.Once done you take towels and you can take a shower as well, free water and soda are offered.If you leave Doplhin bay you are in the aquaventure waterpark so enjoy the rides!Hope this will help."

For myself and my wife i booked 2 tickets to the water park.We were not allowed to go with our children to the encounter and had to pay an additional fee of \u00a360 to go with them.They search your bags to see if you have any food or drinks as they want you to buy theirs,which is very expensive! I felt this was degrading. Also it was \u00a310 for a locker and then our bag wouldn't fit as the locker was approx 15 inch so we had to pay \u00a320.The Dolphin trainers were nice people,polite and friendly but most of the other staff which included the cashier at the front desk, the stewards were rude and arrogant when questioned on specific matters regarding the trip.The photographs being offered for sale are extremely expensive which range from \u00a3100 to \u00a3550.I would also like to add another major issue which we encountered.Although we booked and paid in full for the Dolphin encounter online and confirmed the date And followed the instructions given, to email 48hrs before whith a copy of our voucher,nobody replied and i had to make several phone calls to Atlantis the palm before this was resolved and had to send the email many times as the email address that they kept supplying was void!! The one they supply is DBX-dolphinbay@atlantisthepalm.com The correct one is dolphinbay@atlantisthepalm.com incase you encounter the same issue. Because of this error my uk phone which was all i had cost over \u00a350 on the many calls i had to make to them to resolve the issue.They didn't offer any apology for this.I would advise you get a local sim card if you are going to Dubai and are planning on visiting Dolphin Bay.I have been as detailed as i can in my review which i believe i am entitled to submit and want to do so for the benefit of anyone who is planning on visiting Dolphin Bay at Atlantis the palm!I have been to do this encounter in Florida Disenyland and found that much more friendly and organised and better value all round."

There is a photographer taking photos throughout, and you can then view and buy the photos, there not cheap but we decided to get all the photos on a USB rather than have them print them which saved money and meant that the photos didn't get squashed in our cases.If you do have someone with you who is not swimming they can pay a fee and go into the location and take photos of you.would definitely recommend this."

Only slight disappointment was the cost of the photo's as you can't have your camera with you by the pool you are tied to buy them if you want some memories. We wished we had actually taken part in the deep water encounter afterwards - think you get a lot more for your money so consider which package you would like to do - may be worth paying the extra if you can."

I always read the \"terrible\" reviews and these usually give me some insight into the issues I may face.Well my wife pressured me into going and with some trepidation we booked an Adventure at Dolphin Bay. Boy oh boy! Am I glad she convinced me into going. We were staying with friends on The Palm and they decided to come with us. All in all it was my wife, 13YO daughter, myself as well as our really good friends and their 2 teenagers (7 in total). Upon reading up about the interaction I noticed that the adventure group was limited to 6. The reception was friendly and well managed even though Dolphin Bay was super busy. A very nice Arabic lady received us and settled us in (Bushra). A few minutes later we were escorted by one of the friendliest people I have ever met (Gooli) and taken to the change rooms to get ready. As we walked in things got even better as we were enthusiastically greeted by the dolphin team. After getting changed and listening to a wonderfully informative talk we were ready to meet our dolphin. Our friends (french) were kindly placed with a french speaking trainer (Yoen) who they raved about after the interaction. He was friendly and showed a real passion for the dolphins. We were put in a group with our trainer (Brendan) who ensured we had the best family experience we have ever had. Dolphin Bay can be commended on a team of trainers who are passionate and love their jobs. From Shaun who welcomed us to the trainers Brendan and Yvette it was perfect!In the water we met our dolphin Tulagi (the trainers were very patient with me as I asked them how to spell her name). She was gentle and appeared happy and enthusiastic. We loved touching her as she swam past. Her skin was silky smooth. In addition to swimming alongside her and getting many opportunities to interact with her we also got to dance, kiss, hug and get pushed by our hands. The coup de grace was her belly ride which was super exciting and FAST. Although I really loved swimming with her while we were allowed to touch her. So many things impressed me about this interaction but what impressed me most was the care these animals receive from their trainers.What else can I say?Is it expensive? Yes and totally worth it! I imagine it takes a lot of money to maintain the high standards Atlantis has set for housing their dolphins.What about the Photos? We bought the USB for AED600 and have numerous high quality photos. It is expensive and once again worth it. Is anything included? Yes! The Atlantis Water Park is free for those who bought an interaction. They have two huge towers with some of the best rides I have been on.What a day! What an experience! My daughter has insisted we come every year to Dubai so she can visit Tulagi over and over again. It is a pity we live so far away.Thank you dolphin team."

She is 11 and a decent swimmer, but didn't want to do the full swim, this is a brilliant option.A really warm welcome, the hosts show you around and give you the intro. There are lockers and towels in the changing rooms, so you don't need to take your own. You have to take off all jewellery, hair bands etc. if you want your own photos, someone can wait on the beach next to the bay and take pictures - either that or the professional takes plenty that you can then buy.Just a brilliant experience... We all loved it. Really brilliant. Not cheap by any standards, but a once in a lifetime experience awaits."

It is something I would recommend to absolutely everybody!

The photos taken were not good quality and quite blurry and should have been include dint he package or price but it was not.Furthermore, the rest of the Waterpark is expensive with food and drinks, but the rides are excellent. The locker rooms are near the entrance and it is a far walk from the rets of the park to fetch stuff in your locker. Only one person gets a barcode tag around their arm, making it difficult for others to fetch stuff from the locker."

They have a different price list for hotel guests. The overall experience was amazing. We got a chance to hug, kiss and play with the dolphin. The programme went for around 30 minutes and we were part of 9 people group. Dolphins are very loving and cute so in my opinion this is an experience for any age. Also before you go in the water they give you brief information about the dolphins, their anatomy and habits. I just want to add that and the end of the programme you can purchase photos. One photo cost 30 Australian dollars, so if you want to save money and have more photos of yourself with the dolphins the best thing you can do is to ask a family member or a friend to get an OBSERVER PASS (AED 100). In this case the observer pass holder gets a chance to stay on the beach and they can take as many photos as they please."

I'm so glad that I made right decision to spend my time here. The experience is very special as you not only play with the dolphin, but actually learn and understand them.The check in was smooth, as you would be kindly asked to wait outside before they can put you into groups. After that you will be given a wet suit, and a float jacket (this helped a lot since you will be able to tread water easier) - the changing room is really nice, with a lovely aroma floating around in the air, so refreshing. You will then be escorted to meet Dolphin trainer where they will provide you a very detail section about dolphin. I totally love it!Then here come the highlight of the section - meeting with the dolphin. Each group will have 6 people to play with 1 dolphin (ours is Abbi - she is so cute!!!!) and 2 trainers. For my section of Dolphin Adventure, we got a chance to 1) Touch the dolphin 2) Swim with it 3) Enjoy Dolphin Kiss & Dance 4) Giving Dolphin Hug & Sway with them. I think this experience is AMAZING, no wonder why some of the scientist confirm that playing with dolphin can help children enhance their ability to interact and prevent autism. Even as an adult, when playing with these playful creature, I felt such an enormous joy as if my inner child was yelling to get out and play. Totally unique experience.Although some people may say that the whole activity is really \"generic for tourists\", but I partly disagree. If you can see the joy and passion of the staffs during the section, you will see how much they care for the dolphin and their well-being. I am so glad that I after the trip, I'm not only happy to see the dolphin, but also be inspired by the trainers' passion as well.The only downside that hinder me to give a 5 stars in this review is the quality of the professional photoshoot. Although the price is highly expensive (80 AED for 1 standard photo, 500 AED for USB with all of your photos, and variety of photo package - including print out and usb starting from 800 to 1200 AED), I'm really willing to spend them as I want to have something to keep for this precious moment, but well, the whole shoot was really bad. Most of the photos of me is like in bad lightning condition, blur in the face, shoot from far away - not any close-up shoot to capture any great moment. What a shame!But overall, I think the experience was worthwhile with top-noted service, and you get the free pass to the water park, the Atlantis pool, & the beach as well - it's worth for 800 AED - I highly recommend this activity. Well, maybe next visit, I will try the scuba dive with the dolphin then."

The show keeps everyone with awes for 45 minutes with amazing performance one after another by 5 / 6 dolphins and 3-4 Sea Lions. The dolphins performed to the perfection and it is proved that dolphins are the best friend and substitute for surprising stunts under water. Hats off to the trainers and organizers. They wont allow the audiences to remain idle for a single moment with one or the other continuous lively performance."

We had an amazing day at Dolphin Bay, it wasn't rushed or cramped (which Discovery Cove can be) and the staff did everything to help two toddlers get the most out of their experience. The only negative that I would say is that the photography wasn't as good as it could have been, which was a common complaint at the end of the day. Our package had more than 2/3 of the pictures where you couldn't see us - the three or four pictures that we did get were good, but not brilliant."

We were lucky as a family of 5 to get our own trainer and dolphin for the full 30 minutes.The initial process from signing waivers, getting your wetsuit and changing was relatively well organised but could be better managed with more staff. The locker rooms and showers were also in desperate need of a clean.We would strongly recommend the Dolphin Adventure over the Encounter purely by the amount of contact you get with the dolphin in comparison - it is worth it!"

Informative talk at the beginning. Complimentary soft drinks at the end. You can have a friend or family member take photos from the shore.

We had skywards membership, but Atlantis wouldnt accept this they said the cost was already low!!!!! what Atlantis had done was reduce the cost of the price for August but slghtly more than what we would have got as a discount as a skyward member. 550 they charged but we would have only paid 500 with Skywards!! Typical Atlantis squeezing every penny out of the guests. We paid for visitor passes which allows you access to the beach and lets you take photo's but the photographer kept getting in the way. In the end I told him to move as we had paid to take photo's not just watch, he did move, so we got some very good photo's ourselves. Don;t be scared to do this, after all it's not free, so you have a right, especally when they do the one to one part, it's not like you are spoiling the group photo's. We did buy 2 photo's at 80 dirham each, very expensive for what you get but comes in a nice wallet type frame, the girls wanted a souvenir. I wasnt sure about them doing this experience as I find it difficult to understand why creatures so beautiful are taken from the wild and transferred to these type of places all over the world, but on the other hand I know their chance of survival in the wild is remote as well as they would be probably killed for food. The talk they do before you go to meet the dolphins is informative and interesting and it is clear the staff at dolphin bay really love their dolphins and care about their welfare. When you are in the water with the dolphins they flip rings, balls and also dance for you, one on one, they kiss and cuddle you, all for plenty of fish treats, the staff also do a talk and show you how to tell if they are boy/girl dolphins which lots of informative information, touching and stroking. My girls loved meeting the dolphins and say they learnt a lot."

They provide a choice of either full suit or a life vest & towels. Once the experience is over they provide soft drinks. My other half and mum bought an observer pass which was enough for them to get all the pics we needed without having to spend extra. Enjoyed our experience, would recommend to others :)"

Staff was excellent, very informative and fun! They were running about 20 minutes behind, but no big deal. Life jackets/wetsuits were provided along with complimentary lockers and changing rooms. We were split into groups of 8ish and everyone had equal time with the dolphin. Professional photographers took excellent pictures of all individuals and groups with dolphins. We purchased 8 printed photos + USB with as many photos as we wanted for 600AED or $164US, but well worth it and I hate spending money haha! If you want to take pictures of friends/family, you can pay and stay on the beach or take them with a high powered camera from the waiting area. Was the highlite of my 13 yr. old son's trip! There was a 4/5 year old in our group who really enjoyed it as well. Actual encounter time was about 40 minutes, but the whole event took about 2 hrs. Planning to do the \"Swimming w/Dolphins trip. Something you/kids will always remember:)"

Wet-suits are provided, free of charge, by Dolphin Bay.You will be assigned to one of the dolphin trainers, into a group of 6-7 people (when I went, I was in a group of 6), You will have an opportunity to have your photo taken with the dolphin in various poses. The pictures can be purchased and you can select one to be made into a key chain. I still carry mine and often receive compliments and questions.

My wife has always wanted to spend time with a dolphin, and so we duly booked the Dolphin encounter at Atlantis.First word of warning is that they are NOT cheap - AED 620 each, with no discount for kids (mine are 6 & 4). If you are able to plan ahead of time you can get a 50 dirham discount if you book more than 14 days ahead. Second warning is that you are not allowed to take any camera into the water with you. I fully understand considering the environment you are entering and safety to the dolphins. The drawback is that you are reliant on the in-house photographers to capture these special moments. Once again the photo's do not come cheap. Although, there are various packages available, they all come at a price.So, now that the negative is out of the way, the experience really is great. The groups are relatively small (could be smaller), and you get a few different interactions with the dolphin. They are truly amazing creatures and it is great to see them so close up. The team handling the interaction were also great, and they try and ensure a good experience for everyone (including the dolphin).Due to the nature of the activity, the experience with the dolphin does not last much longer than 30 - 40 minutes, so if you are happy to pay the price, especially considering the time in the water, then it is well worth it!"

So when we've taken our 3 and 5 year old kids to experience swimming with the dolphins in shallow water, was a treat.Our kids absolutely loved every minute of it and so did we!After you are given wet suits, there is a short presentation and movie before you go in the water, for your 30 minutes session. You cant have any hair clips, jewellery or anything that can hurt them and please pay attention to the instructions given as these are very important to keep the dolphins safe and the experience a pleasurable one to everyone since you might be with other families if you are not in a big group. The staff is friendly, professional and knowledgeable. This is certainly an experience of a lifetime - to be able to interact, dance, play, kiss, touch the dolphins and especially to learn about these lovely and intelligent creatures!It is not cheap and worth every penny. If you can swim and are not with kids, recommend the more advanced experience.If you can't swim, go for the shallow water experience and allow yourself this experience.After your session is over, enjoy the cold drinks and make the most of you ticket by spending the rest of your day at the water park. Try booking the first session in the morning to really make the most of your money."

The experience involves first checking in at the entrance of the Atlantis, then walking/buggying your way across the water park to Dolphin Bay. You then go through a series of check-ins, are given a locker and a choice of vest or wetsuit to change into and finally have to sit through a 15 minute educational presentation about dolphins. You are then split into groups of a maximum of 10 people per dolphin. The actual experience in the water lasts 30 minutes and is well organised and very fun. Each member of the group gets to have their photo taken whilst kissing and hugging the dolphin and then are given the opportunity to choose an activity (dancing or throwing a toy for the dolphin to fetch). The trainers are friendly and despite my initial reservations about paying to see dolphins in captivity, the trainers do make you feel that the dolphin's well-being is a priority and they are very well cared for. The only bad point is the ridiculous cost of the professional photos, it's worth noting that it costs less to buy a beach pass and have a friend take your own photos about 15 ft away from the action. Overall, an excellent experience and the free entry into Aquaventure is an added bonus.(tip - valet your car at the Avenues entrance and you can get your valet ticket validated at the ticket window)"

The whole experience in the water last about 30 minutes and in that time you get to play and touch the dolphin in the shallow waters then you go into the deeper waters where the dolphins will push you along by your feet, and they will kiss you and you grab their fins as they drag you along in the water. Great fun. If your not a great swimmer then its not to bad as the lifejackets keep you afloat and not alot of the experience is in the deeper waters. It was absolutely amazing just went to quick, definately feel that you should have a little more time with them. And the only negative was the fact that the photos were very expensive to buy afterward, with the price of the experience you should get at least one photo free. But definately recommend it."

There are groups of no more than 10, only downside is there are lots of kids, they could do with an adult group? since they split everyone up after the presentation. Beach observer pass is a good idea as the pictures are 80aed for 1 by the pofessional photographer. We booked the 10:30am on a saturday experience which worked well. Drive to the Avenues enterance and mention you are at dolphin bay and its free valet, no need to park a mile away and get a shuttle.

It was a wonderful experience, we were given some general knowledge on dolphins which was informative but not too much to get bored, they are very careful to ensure that no foreign objects can get into the water with the dolphins and even hair bobbles are not allowed. The staff are extremely caring and their affection for the dolphins is very obvious which is very encouraging. We were introduced to Lennox a 12 year old male dolphin, to stand and touch this warm blooded mammel was a humbling experience. I would highly recommend Dolphin Bay."

Recommend you book this in advance of your stay as they sell out fast.On arrival you are asked to change into wet suits, these are better then vests as it covers most of your body as the pool is slightly colder temperature. No loose items can be worn, e.g. Watches, hair bands etc. however sun hats are allowed.You are then given a tutorial explaining dolphins, what not do and what you will be doing. You are then split into groups of 10. Everyone takes it in turns to kiss or dance with the dolphin. It was great fun and organised well despite it lasting only 30 mins. We had a 3 year old, she was a bit apprehensive but she got in the water and was fine, she touched it but did not want to get closer than that. The staff were more patient with allowing for us having a small child and did lots of encouragement. The pool floor was sandy and soft.The photos are expensive we paid 600aed for 8 photos with a USB stick of all the photos. I did not mind paying knowing this is a one off experience. I compared prices to that of Discovery Cove in Sea World, Florida and that is just as expensive."

There are a number of other dolphin experiences, however if you are scuba certified I think this is a great option as you really get a better view of the dolphins, and a different interaction with them.The handlers were all amazing, very friendly, and definitely concerned with making sure we had fun.We had a chance to hold the dolphin, feed them a fish, and a few other things. Just incredible.While (of course!) it costs extra, I would recommend buying the pictures as they take tons of photos of you which are of great quality and really capture each moment."

It was quite expensive but not something that you would do everyday. The dolphins were lovely and is was surprisingly emotional to interact with one. I was a bit taken back to find out that the lagoon is a man made concrete lagoon, not the beachfront, natural lagoon I had envisioned, but that was maybe down to my lack of research. The staff are great, there's an opportunity to purchase pictures if you don't have anyone who isn't participating and can take them. The pictures are displayed on screens but are very small, so choosing is difficult. The dolphins are so beautiful, it was a wonderful experience."

The sun was piping hot overhead and the water in the lagoon was freezing cold around my waist and feet but all of this is soon forgotten when you are finally given the opportunity to interact with your dolphin. Our group was made up of 10 persons (a mix of 6 adults and 4 kids) and each family had there turn to hug, kiss, dance and play with the dolphins all of which is set against the backdrop of the Atlantis. All are photo opportunities in themselves if only just to look back at yourselfe in a wet suit!The 'Dolphin Encounter' lasts 30 minutes and is suitable for all ages and swimming abilities as no swimming required. Do give yourself about 2 hours for this experience, there is the check in and changing into your black, blue and yellow labelled Atlantis wet suits which takes about half an hour. This is then followed by an informative/interactive chat on dolphins and marine life before they set you free amongst the dolphins.Do take a change of clothing with you to wear under the wet suit as the water is very cold! The changing facilities are communal and they provide you with towels and a locker. Alongside Dolphin Bay's own boutique store is another souvenir shop and a Starbucks! Travelled with my 7 year old."

This is the shallow water version that allows young kids to participate. We were somewhat concerned that it may be limited by that, but it was actually a very fulfilling experience for all of us, with a lot of interaction with our dolphin. The way the dolphins obey all the instructions is both impressive and somewhat disconcerting - how is it possible that an animal can be so obedient and predictable in its behaviour. But the staff go our of their way to explain that dolphins are treated well, they participate in only 2-3 events each per day, and in fact live much longer than animals in the ocean, so at least their health is good. In our group, there were ten of us in total and we all individually got a chance to touch the dolphin many times, dance with it or play fetch with it, and to kiss it. We had two of our parents join us as observers, which cost a lot - 60 euros each - for the right to sit close to where we were, see us and take photos (plus access to the watermark and beach). The official photographer's photos were great, however, so we ended up buying these too (the whole set on a USB). The photo of our daughter kissing the dolphin is probably one of the best photos we have of her and represents well this truly memorable experience. A touristy affair, yes, and an expensive one, but very worthwhile, well organised and truly unique - at least in Europe and the Middle East."

There is absolutely no sense of direction in relation to what the day involves or even how you get to the dolphin arena. The sad thing is that what should have been a once in a life time experience was another day of frustration and disappointment in terms of actually participating.Also don't pay the extra $90 dollars to enter the watching area if you are not a participant.

Admittedly that included entrance to the water park but we didn't want to go into the water park! I had to try and take photos on my iPhone because I couldn't video but this was hard because my daughter's group were 100m away in deep water. You really need a camera with a good zoom lens. Every time a spectator even stepped into the water to get a better shot, an attendant would usher them back. It was very controlled and all about The Atlantis making money and ensuring you buy their expensive official photos, not really about a great family experience. With 6 in a group, the individual interaction with the dolphin is limited. My husband and I thought it was very disappointing and not good value for money. However my daughter enjoyed the experience with the dolphin. Each group interact with one dolphin. I feel strongly that The Atlantis should state on their website \"no video cameras allowed\". As for relaxing on a sun lounger with drinks as stated on their website, soft drinks are provided in the participants' changing area afterwards."

We visited Dolphin Bay following a recommendation from a friend and opted for the Photo fun option, which was interaction with a Dolphin on the edge of the water.The Atlantis hotel where the attraction is based is huge and following my experience, I would recommend you try and book one of the morning slots before lunch time, as the place gets really busy. After checking in, you are taken by golf buggy to Dolphin Bay where you can watch other groups before you interact with the Dolphins. You are not allowed to wear any jewelry at all including small earnings, so I suggest you leave any jewelry back at your hotel.The actual interaction with the Dolphin is short, I would guess around 15 minutes and you are in a small group of 4 people, each taking it in turns to touch the Dolphin. It is a great \u2018taster\u2019 if you are unsure if you would like the \u2018in water\u2019 experience. A lady in my group was booked in to the \u2018in water\u2019 experience later that day, but felt she didn\u2019t want to go in the water having had the edge of the water experience with her small daughter, so worth considering, as all of the interactions are reasonably expensiveThe facility is spotless and the staff are kind, patient and very keen for all to have a great experience. They obviously care a great deal about the welfare of the Dolphins and this shows in the way the staff/Dolphins interactions.As part of the package, we also purchased the lost chambers pass and this was enjoyable and again, the staff were friendly and keen for you to get the best from the visit.The Atlantis itself was nice to wander around after both experiences and all in all, I thought the package worth the money. Just beware when you are leaving the hotel that you specify a taxi rather than private limo. We were put in a car which transpired after to be a private limo (it looked like an ordinary car) and whilst the fare was on a meter, it was double the fare in a normal taxi on the journey there."

I can't recommend this enough. The royal swin does include treading water in deep water and swimming so would recommend you are comfortable in water and a good swimmer but there are loads of different versions available to suit everyone.

We don't swim so did the photo shoot with the dolphins.My kids were a bit reluctant to touch or kiss the dolphins but the staff were really patient and encouraging. Great photos too. Pricey though. About $92 per person and then to get all the prints and the CD was another $300 or so. We could have gone with just the 8 prints that were included in the fee but........My daughter (who's five and a half) has said that the next time we visit Dubai, SHE is going to swim with the dolphins and so I had better know how to swim by then, lol!!We hung out at the resort till late - a bit of a mistake since the queues at the taxi rank were long! My advice? Book a pick up car for when you are done. There is a train station there so find out if the metro gets there or not. Our car driver said it didn't but I can't take his word for it."

After you get your wetsuit and attend a briefing on the facility and the dolphins, you are split into groups of 6 for your encounter. We had a great time, got to spend loads of time with the dolphin, Sol, had loads of time to interact with the dolphin. You do not have to be a great swimmer, as the water is very salty and having the wetsuit on makes you quite buoyant, so as long as you are confident you will get through it safely. Please remember that you have to remove all jewellery, watches, earrings, clips, leather straps etc. for the encounter so rather leave them at your hotel before you go. We were disappointed with the quality of photographs the official photographer took, honestly, poor quality and not good enough for the price you pay.....sort this out please Dolphin Bay.Otherwise, a wonderful experience."

Excellent activity to actually swim with the Dolphins is \u00a3190 pounds per adult (2013 price) a wet suit is provided and a body vest but you must be able to tread water as this activity takes place in the deep water lagoon (you do not have to be Olympic standard though). 2 other dolphin activities are offered one is a scuba dive, the other for children and non swimmers if called encounter where you stand in shallow water and play games with the Dolphin. Book this in advance as bookings are timed and if the resort is busy you could miss out. Our hotel contacted the resort for us therefore no phone costs for us and the booking confirmation was emailed to the hotel PERFECT!!"

Booking was simple and efficient online in advance. Staff at check in were friendly and efficient. The on site Starbucks is great for a snack. Staff is outgoing and friendly. The experience exceeded our family's expectations. Spent 30 minutes in the water with our dolphin doing all sorts of tricks. At the end the obligatory photo booth visit will cost abut $100 for all your pics on a USB but I wouldn't miss the chance to have those memories. Well done."

First of all this place is expensive, in fact let me say again it is very expensive, we paid over 400GBP for 2 adults and a child and the expense only starts there given the ludicrously overpriced pictures.Secondly it is very commercial and slick with continuous groups of up to 10 people doing different experiences and cameramen will take a snap of everything.It is unique in that you get to touch and kiss and cuddle the dolphins and you should have learnt something about them after the experience.Note that you have to be a very good swimmer for the adventure and be confident in shallow and waist height water especially with small ones, it isn't as easy as they make it appear.Being disabled I was slower than most and had to shout very loudly to get the trainers attention and eventually had to complain as they took no account of the fact that I was disabled in charge of a three year old so please make sure in advance they are aware of any special needs otherwise they may just plough on and leave you to it as they did with me.To be fair to them we got a full apology and some goodies to make up for the initial disappointment.The initial briefing was pretty lacklustre but overall a worthwhile if expensive treat but do your homework first."

However it was so challenging to have good photos because the staffs would move on purpose to prevent you from well-shots. This was understandable that they wanted to up-sell.

For the royal swim you do have to swim. It was one of the best experiences in my life, it is a bit expensive but once you are there and if you make a full day visit it is worthy. Photos are expensive with different packages available. I was alone with no observer to take pictures of me and so I had to buy from the shop.

The time spent with the Dolphins is sufficient.The only reason this does not earn 5 stars is the blunders that I experienced with reception. I chose to propose to my partner at this activity, the plan went off without a hitch. However, despite paying in advance for a package including photos and floral arrangements etc etc they had no idea what I was talking about.

            "review": "One of the best days of my life. Last weekend I went to Dolphin Bay to do the Dolphin Scuba Dive. Needless to say I was very excited before the experience. I have already been to Dolphin Bay once and have done the Royal Swim which was absolutely wonderful, but this one takes the cake!I got there early, at about just after 9 o'clock. I went to go check in even though the time of the dive was 9:30. There are little golf carts that drive you straight to Dolphin Bay which save you walking the whole way there. Once there, your given wetsuits to wear. There are change rooms with lockers inside as well as warm showers which are great for afterwards. Once your are done changing you attend a little prior orientation. The orientation is great because it not only shows you how to properly interact with the animals and what not to do (eg. touch eyes, cover blow hole, etc. ) but also its really educational. I'm pretty much a know-it-all when it comes to dolphins but even then I still learned a few more interesting facts about dolphins.After the orientation I, along with the other members in my group, all got geared up with the help of the other trainers. They were all friendly and introduced themselves to us. Asked us if we had any questions and went over the underwater signals. We then headed for the water where Tina (the dolphin) was already waiting for us with her trainer. Being underwater with these animals was truly amazing and by far the best experience of my life. It was so great being in their world and just watching how they moved underwater. Even watching the trainer interact with the dolphin was a sight to see. We all got to hug the dolphin, get a kiss, feel what they feel like, have a dorsal tow, feed a fish and watch them do behaviours (jumps, tail walk) from below. There was one trainer underwater to assist us if we required it, another to show us what to do, one trainer directing the dolphin and a photographer. After the dive once we had surfaced we all got to touch Tina again as well as view some of her behaviours from above the surface. She was brilliant and we all gave her a final cheer as we left the water. After that we bid farewell and thanks to the trainers, had warm showers and received a free cool drink or water of our choice there after. Then I headed towards the exit where they display all the photographs from you experience. In summary: I had a great experience!!! Tina was amazing and it was just brilliant to watch her, even when it wasn't your turn to interact wither her. I think this is what makes this program so much more unique than the others. The best part, apart from being with the dolphins of course!, was how great the trainers were. They were all friendly, happy to help and I felt more than confident with them under water. Not once did I worry. Not that I think I would of been worried but someone did ask me the question if I was scared or not. I was also lucky in the fact that there are meant to be 6 people in a group, but this time there was only 3 including myself. If you ever do plan on coming to dolphin bay, I sincerely recommend the dolphin scuba dive, you wont be sorry! If you don't have a scuba certification, then the Royal Swim by all means. Whenever you purchase a ticket for Dolphin Bay, it will automatically include a day pass for Aquaventure, the waterpark. I would recommend that you get to Dolphin Bay early, so that you can spend the rest of the day in the waterpark and make the most of your money. Towels are included when you go to Dolphin Bay, so that is also a plus because it saves you bringing you your own. The only negative thing I have to say is that the photos that the photographers take of you are a little pricey. Overall, 5 stars from me and I would love to do this again!"

The group was split into groups of 8, keeping families and couples together.The interaction involves kisses, hugs playing with the dolphins individually and plenty of other interaction.

And for those who are nervous (I admit that I was!) they do start off pretty slowly with the dolphin encounter so you have time to become more comfortable. I would have given this 5 stars instead of 4, except for the cost of the photos afterwards, which were painfully expensive. One tip would be to make sure you look at ALL the photo options, not just the three or so that are advertised more prominently (and are not the best value). We paid about \u00a390 for 4 or 5 printed photos in the cardboard \"frames\" plus all of our photos on a CD/DVD. For the same price you could also get your photos on the dolphin-shaped USB key but no print-outs, so we thought this was a better option. Better yet, if you're at Atlantis with other friends/family, for about \u00a310 you can have someone join you inside Dolphin Bay (but onshore) and they can take pictures for you. Just a couple of ideas to help out a family on a budget."

You can touch and kiss the dolphin and then dance with him. Even today after on week, she can talk only about the dolphins..... I know the price was high, but it was worth seeing the happiness on my child's face.also they will provide you with a photo of your interaction with the dolphin, at the counter immediately.

The dolphins live in a sterile, unnatural environment and are trained like circus animals to perform tricks and stunts to entertain the visitors.At every stage of your 'experience' a camera is pointed at you and your dolphin. Subsequently, the most outrageous prices are charged for prints of these photographs. I know that nothing in Dubai is cheap, but this was just taking the mickey.And so I was left feeling ripped off and desperately sorry for the poor mammals that are forced to participate in this money-grabbing venture."

Its about 6-10 people per dolphin. and they have several groups going at a time. Each dolphin swims around for your to pet several times, and then if you are in a group, or alone, you get to hug your dolphin for a photo, and dance, or play a game with the dolphin as well. The water is cool, so i would recommended at least the light jacket they give out, if you don't take the whole shorty wet suit, especial if you go in the afternoon as the sun is going down.

We booked Dolphin Bay direct through the Atlantis hotel before we left and it was well worth it.We paid just under \u00a3300 for two adults and 1 child (6 years old). You select a day and time slot when you book.On the day we ended up getting there about an hour eary but they fitted us in to the next session so we only had to wait 5 or 10 mins.Once inside there is a 'talk' and some facts about the dolphins. You are then split into groups and given an instructor. You have wet suits provided and have to remove all jewellry and hair bands but you can wear caps.The groups are no more than 10 people and there are two instructors. There is also someone in the water taking photos but you forget that they are there. You get lots of chances to touch and stroke the dolphins. You get a choice of dancing or playing with the dolphins, then you get to kiss the dolphin and then to cuddle the dolphin with your family. They make the dolphin 'talk' and splash you. It is great fun.At the end of the experience, you get a free soft drink or water.The photos really are great. They are expensive but not what I would have expected them to be - they are not wildly expensive. We got every photo that we appeared in, which was about 40 odd, on a stick (shaped as a dolphin!) plus 8 photos. You can get just one but this works out more expensive. They do lots of different deals so you can chose as many or as few as you want. They are excellent quality.They are very good with young children. My little boy said that he did not want to kiss the dolphin but they were so good with him that he did do it and he enjoyed it so much, he got to have a tiny bit longer than everyone else!!The whole experience only lasts 30 mins so make the most of it.This was very well organised and a very worthwhile experience."

If you are in a party of 3 or more, one of you should stay out of the water and get an observer pass. This will allow you to take photographs as cameras are not allowed in the water. Filming isn't allowed either.Choose a quieter time during the day, usually after 2:30pm and make sure that you are not wearing headbands, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, rings, etc. All jewellery will have to be removed before you get into the water to avoid harming the dolphins - including studs and piercings. There will be an induction session before you get into the water and after you have changed into the swimsuits they provide. They will also provide you with a locker and towels. On your return complimentary - and much needed- drinks are offered. All in all a wonderful experience. You will not be disappointed."

We spent the first part of the day at the water park and the beach at Atlantis before our booking time at Dolphin Bay. My younger daughter (11) and I did the Dolphin Adventure and my husband and elder daughter (15) did the Royal Swim.It was very well organised - get changed into wet suits, bit of a fun info session about dolphins before heading out for 30 mins in the water with them. In the Dolphin Adventure we got a kiss, dance, and hug from the dolphin and got a spin around by the hand and then a belly swim. There were 6 of us to 1 dolphin. In the Royal Swim, they got a push along by the feet and a pull along by 2 dolphins as well as the kiss, hug and dance. My only suggestion (if you are going as a family, but are doing 2 seperate swims) would be to space the swims apart by an hour. That way you can watch each other doing it, and also take your own photo's from the beach. We spaced ours out by 30 mins, but as the first hour is inside getting changed, having safety talks and and the info session, by the time we were out to do the swim, my husband and daughter were inside for their talk! The photographers did a great job and got some great snaps - but they are very expensive to buy. All up, an excellent and unforgettable experience and I would highly recommend it !"

The Dolphins are well looked after and the trainers are very professional and knowledgeable on the behaviours and habitat of the Indo-pacific dolphin and how to handle them when you are in the water. The experience starts of with some common sense do's and don'ts when interacting with the dolphins and there is a short question and answer session about the dolphins before you get to meet them. I certainly came away from it learning something new about the dolphins We had the opportunity at the time to have fun with Danetta? The youngest of the dolphins at the experience, and spent a good 30 minutes having fun in the water. Great value for money, had loads of fun and didn't feel rushed at all. Photos were a little bit expensive but that depends on the package you choose after the experience. The photographers take some fantastic pictures of the experience you have and its worth the money in my opinion. Try and do the dolphin bay experience in the morning or early afternoon so that you can spend the rest of the day you in the park. Also make sure you take some cash with you to get photos and don't do what we did and leave everything in the main lockers"

When you are in the water with the dolphin you spend most of the time doing nothing and looking at other people having their photos taken. (10 people in a group). I think that I touched the dolphin 6 times (three of which were when I was having my photo taken). The photographers are supposed to be professional but from the quality of the photos I wouldn't say they were. The photos are also very expensive to buy and if you want to buy all of them or more than 4, it's cheaper to buy them on a CD or USB but then you have the photos of the other people in your group who you don't even know. At the start you get a photo taken with the dolphin jumping behind you. It would have been a nice photo if the photo was not taken from such a distance and if I didn't have to buy it with 6 people I don't know as it's taken as a group!!! The trainer we had also had problems understanding English - he kept asking if we had any questions which we did and when we asked him he had no idea what we were saying and answered something completely different and sometimes he didn't even know the answer. Don't waste your money doing this. We have swam with dolphins before in Orlando and for the same price you have a 30 minute swim where you actually swim with the dolphin and touch it more than 6 times. You also get a lot of personal photographs (no photos with people you don't know) and a full day of food and drinks included in the price."

It was a risk booking this as i was really scared about going in the water,but im so glad i did. We chose the dolphin interaction,the water comes up to your thigh,however you are expected to kneel in the water,so it does come up higher. I explained to the trainer i was scared of water and he helped me whenever i needed to move about. Being able to play,touch and learn about the dolphins made all the anxiety worth while,and i loved every minuite of it. Yes,the photos are a little expensive,but they are worth it to remember this fantastic day. Book it,you wont regret it."

Before you start interaction, they will explain to you the do's and don'ts at the pool. Once it's done, they will then take you to the pool with the bunch of other people. There are several choices of program you can go for - shallow water, deep water experience, diving with dolphins and many more. We've gone for shallow water. You get plenty of time to interract with a dolphin.Amazingly, while our interraction, there was a couple and the guy actually proposed to his girl friend in front of us. What happened is a guess he has given the ring to the trainers prior to the session. They have hidden it in toy with which the dolphin usually plays. Once the girl has thrown the toy, the dolphin brought it back and there was an engagement ring attached to it! We were all so shocked and plesantly surprised. I think it's an awesome idea, however i am not too sure if they take any extra fee for this to be organised.They have camera men taking pictures, so you can either buy a few printed ones, or get all the pics on USB or selec from any other choices.I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience & i highly recommend doing this if you are in Dubai!"

You get a good amount of time with the dolphins and within your small group (about 6) you get to have lots of interactions with the dolphins. I would definitely recommend one of the encounters within the deeper water to get the best experience, it is worth the extra money. The setting within the Atlantis is great and having the water park to use after was nice. The professional photos taken during the experience are also not as expensive as you might expect for an attraction of this nature."

One important note \u2013 for the dolphin encounter, there is no such thing as free watching! You have to pay AED300 (about \u00a350!) per adult (AED 265 for a child) just for an observer\u2019s ticket; be aware that all children under 12 going for a dolphin encounter must be accompanied by an adult (maximum 3 kids per adult!).

If we go back to Dubai I would do this again. Afterwards we got the buggy back to the water park and enjoyed the rides,however, when we went to get some towels we were told that we should have kept the towels we had at the dolphin swim ( we were not aware of this and I am not sure if the staff at Dolphin Bay are either) as if we wanted towels we would have to pay 30 dirhams, which we did not do as I think that's a bit cheeky to ask us to pay more when the swim cost in excess of \u00a3300!!!! Maybe the management at the Atlantis and Dolphin Bay can look into this. Luckily we were lent some spare towels by some helpful holidaymakers. So just double check before you go.

We were staying at the Royal Meridien hotel so paid a little more for the attraction than if we were staying at Atlantis but it was all booked efficiently through the Arabian Adventures rep in our hotel. Definitely book this in advance! First of all you are not guaranteed a time if you just turn up and the ticket booth is shared with Aquaventure so the crowds just become ridiculous if you don't get there early. For 3 of us we paid 1,785 UAE Dirhams which is just over \u00a3300; not cheap but you can easily spend this on a dinner and night club here!The Dolphin Bay tickets do allow you to use the Aquaventure Water Park so it is best to get an early time for the dolphins and then just walk or take the golf buggy back to the Water Park.(I will review Aquaventure separately)You have a choice of interacting with the dolphins either in shallow or deep water; with our 7 year old we had no choice really but to go for the shallow water but this did not lessen our enjoyment at all. The changing facilities are great and the related instruction and orientation are efficiently done; you are then split into groups of 10 and allocated one of the dolphins - the day we were there there were 3 groups of 10 for the one time slot we had reserved. The actual interaction with the dolphin probably lasts around 25 mins but it is fantastic and tough to put into words; there are plenty of photos are taken by one of the reps which you can buy later at the boutique (they are not cheap either but they are of very high professional quality and make a fantastic little souvenir)."

Typically 3 small groups of 4 to 5 each is assigned to a well trained dolphin.Each dolphin has atleast 12 to 15 years experience and is extremely gentle & safe to touch and play with.We are give a 10 minutes audio visual presentation. We are escorted to the bay area with an experienced trainer wearing our diving suit.The dolphin offers a peck on your cheeks; next as you make a circular gesture with your arms the dolphin dives down and resurfaces parallel to your body to give you a wonderful HUG. A stretched hand gets you to do a merry go round spin with the dolphin. However the ultimate experience is a back flip where the dolphin swims backwards and you hang on to the flippers for a 50m drag . Those 30 minutes are absolutely amazing, magical & divinely spiritual resonating at the deepest level as we touch & play with such an adorable & intelligent mammal."

            "review": "Best thing to do in Dubai... fantastic for adults and children alike.. I have done all of the interactions at Atlantis and can honestly say they are all fantastic. This particular interaction involves wading into a crystal clear lagoon and experiencing the dolphins without having to worry about swimming. Look out for special prices and deals. I paid around AED 2200 for my family of four which may seem expensive and yet when you have the privilege of spending time with these special dolphins it almost seems too little.The dolphins are housed in a state or the art facility which is incredibly spacious and staffed by professionals who truly care for the environment and the dolphins they are looking after. Atlantis can be proud if this dedicated team.Pros: 1)Touching, kissing, hugging, playing and learning about dolphins and their environment.2) Educational and entertaining.3) Anybody can do it... young, old... and no need to know how to swim. I even saw staff assisting a man in a wheelchair get into the water and enjoy the interaction... INCREDIBLE!4) Friendly, professional staff who go out of their way for everyone and show incredible care for their dolphins.So many Pros!Cons: None.We did a 10:30 shallow water. We arrived at 10:20 and were directed to the entrance to the Aqua water park. From here we got our tickets and caught a golf cart to Dolphin Bay. We were warmly received by the team at Dolphin Bay (10:35) and after a few minutes were taken to a building where we were given information, wetsuits and a talk about dolphins. As we had to remove jewellery and watches I am not sure what time we started the interaction but when we had finished up and I had changed the time was close to midday."

            "review": "A WOW moment of our holiday at Atlantis.. This was not a cheap experience but in my opinion, a once in a lifetime chance and worth every penny. It cost us AED 1980 for a family of four. (\u00a3343 - \u00a386 each). We chose the Encounter as one of children is not a confident swimmer and the encounter takes place in waist high water. Due to the age restriction, all children under 12 years old must be accompanied by a paying adult, so we decided to do it as a family, rather than one parent and it was the best decision we ever made. Upon checking into Dolphin Bay, you are given the choice of a wetsuit or a sleeveless jacket. We opted for the wetsuit. We were told this was the best option as the saltwater pools are cold at 25 degrees Celsius, which made us laugh, as we welcomed the cool water in the intense heat of 38 deg C that day! A brief orientation on how to behave in the pool was mostly missed by me as I was struggling to take off my wedding rings (as no jewellery, glasses or accessories are allowed in the dolphin pools). But it didn\u2019t matter as the dolphin instructors guide you every second of the experience. 30 minutes in the pool includes touching and stroking the dolphin, playing or dancing individually, group photos and then individual kiss shots. Every part of the experience is photographed professionally. After a shower and a drink, you can make your way to the shop to buy souvenirs and photos of your encounter. Our group was 8 people and over 80 photos were taken. We chose to buy all our photos on a CD, with the option to print them at home. The CD cost about \u00a360. Expensive, but much cheaper than buying individual photos, as there were too many to choose from. An amazing experience we will never forget."

I did the Dolphin Adventure with our 8 and 11 year olds (as participants in the Royal Swim need to be 12 or over). We had a wonderful time. We were able to touch and play with the dolphin, dance, hug and receive a kiss and then go for a belly ride, fantastic. My husband and our 14 year old did the 'Royal Swim' which included all of the above but replaced the belly ride with a dorsil fin tow and a foot push. We all agreed that either experience would be fantastic, so don't feel you are missing out if the children are not old enough to do the Royal Swim. Highly recommended."

Everyone gets a chance to have a ring or ball retrieved, or a dance with the dolphin. You also have multiple opportunities to pet, hug and yes...even kiss the dolphin.

Bring someone along to do it for you on the beach if you want, otherwise, dish out and additional USD 120 to get about 50 professional pics on a USB stick (it is quite EXPENSIVE yes... as the whole experience is)PLUSIn a nutshell, as a group (10 max) and individually, you interact, stroke, dance, play with the dolphin, it s great !The facilities are great and quite grand and organization is very professionalMINUSThe introductory sequence where you sit and look at powerpoint presentation is a tad too longExpensive"

I applaud the passion of the dolphin trainers in being the voice of these magnificent creatures and inspiring us to live our lives more consciously in a way that respects nature and the longevity of our planet. These dolphins are powerful ambassadors that are making a very real difference in changing the way humanity interacts with their environment.My friends and I decided to book an exclusive experience whereby the four of us did a dolphin adventure and were able to have a dolphin all to ourselves. WOW!!! WE WERE TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY. Having the financial means to afford such an experience is a gift that I am grateful for and give thanks for every single day.

There was a lot of waiting around for stragglers. After the dolphin experience I really questionned myself as to whether the entire set up was ethical or not. The dolphins at the centre were caught in the wild just North of Australia. I don't think I agree with that. I'm also not sure that it is appropriate to train such beautiful animals to entertain us. There are other options for coming close to dolphins in the wild, and I think that these might be a better investment, albeit not a guaranteed experience."

Refreshments are also included, a can of pop or water.The staff are friendly and good at their jobs, they are also great with the little ones especially in the educational part. Staff at the Atlantis are from all over the World so you will find someone who speaks your language without any problems.Photographs must be purchased separately at the end of your encounter and when we travelled the package included 2 photos and you were not able to buy just the one. I think we paid 300 Dirhams for the 2 if I remember correctly.Lockers are provided to keep your belongings safe and are simple to use, all explained in the short briefing. Wetsuits or vests are also provided and the guys are experienced in getting you into the right sizes etc.Be aware, you cannot wear anything loose when getting in the water so all jewellery and any hair bands/clips must be removed...this led to some outrageous hair dos after having my hair in a bobble all day which looked just delightful on our photos!!I have always wanted to swim with the Dolphins and am glad that we had this experience in Duabi."

She is a dolphin instructor so you will see dolphin jumping or playing with a ball. This is the positive, the negative thing is that the real interaction with the animals is very little, only caressing him. In my opinion, the show aims to have you some photos with the dolphin, then you can see them and decide if buying or not and usually people buy them. Considering that the whole experience is VERY EXPENSIVE, I wouldn't advice to do it, especially if you can go to the Caribbean , where our experience was much better.More interaction, no shallow waters, but deep waters where you could swim with the dolphins, wearing a lifejackets so that even young children could swim. Nothing at all at he Dolphin bay. Believe me: you can skip it."

Then we got out and there were only 2 hot showers for all of us to use or take a cold one. No soap available but we got to use complimentary towels. We were told that we'd get a drink and a snack right after but what they offered was pop and water and we needed to ask. The photos cost for 1 CD and 5 photos was 150 Euros!

You don't plunge into a tank but rather are given the illusion that you're walking out into the shallows of a tropical beach to spend some quality time with a dolphin. Our kids loved every minute of the encounter which took us through group and individual activities with our dolphin (one dolphin to a group or pod) under the watchful eye of our coordinator and trainer.

The area which they've created is truly remarkable, the sand was great and the water was clear and they had beach chairs with umbrellas for friends and family to view from at an extra 100 AED per person.

My partner and I went all out and booked a Dolphin Encounter, Dolphin Adventure and a Royal Swim.The Dolphin Encounter was done on a Maldivian style beach in crystal clear water. We spent 30 minutes perched on our knees in the lagoon and thoroughly enjoyed the close contact we had with our dolphin. The encounter involved kissing, hugging, touching and playing with our dolphin. A truly wonderful experience. The trainers were superb and the close bond they share with their dolphins is inspirational.Next on our list was the Dolphin Adventure (Possibly my favorite). Plunging into the surprisingly cool water we had a spectacular time bonding with our new dolphin friend. The entire experience was finished off with a belly ride to the beach... phenomenal! This program is spent in the deeper section of the dolphin's habitat and the ability to swim is necessary. Last on our program list was the Royal Swim. Once again we absolutely loved the program and really enjoyed holding on to our two dolphins as they took us for a fantastic ride to the beach from the deep water. Another highlight was being pushed by the foot, whilst on a boogie board , by our dolphin at break neck speed! Lots of fun. This program is designed for the adventurous folk out there. A note on pricing and group sizes. We paid between AED 595 p/p and AED 925 p/p for the various programs and I would happily have paid much more for the professional and safe way the programs have been set up. Our group size for the encounter was 8 (Maximum 10 per dolphin), our adventure was 6 (Maximum 6 per dolphin) and the royal swim was 5 (Maximum 6 per dolphin). Although we enjoyed all three programs beyond our wildest expectations, my personal favorite was probably the Adventure. We will most definitely be back again and again and again!!!I purchased a CD with a range of photos from the entire interaction for around AED 500 and am extremely happy with the quality of the photos. It was mentioned at some stage during the briefings that photographers would be there to capture the experience and although I noticed their presence it was by no means intrusive.During my last program the trainer mentioned a new dive interaction which sounded absolutely exciting and unique... I will be sure to book it as soon as I see availability. A big thank you to the amazing people and dolphins who make it possible for us to experience our dreams coming true."

My sister has wanted to swim with dolphins since she was 5 years old so when I was arranging a trip for her 21st birthday staying at the Atlantis and arranging an experience at Dolphin Bay seemed a great idea, and it was! She absolutely loved it. We had the Royal Swim which was not cheap but in our minds worth the extra - it means you have a group of up to 6, have a dorsal swim, hugs, kisses, etc. The time goes way to quick but we would highly recommend the experience. The staff at Dolphin Bay are amazing to.Beware the cost for photos - not cheap but you will definately want some of them!!"

            "review": "Dolphin Bay at Atlantis Resort's Aquaventure is an excellent experience!!. The shallow water dolphin interaction at Dolphin Bay in Aquaventure Park at the Atlantis resort of Dubai is truly an amazing experience! You get a great opportunity to get up close and personal with the dolphins in a small group of 10 or less (unless you spring for the extra charge to have a private interaction but probably not necessary) and you get admission to the waterpark. The dolphin adventure begins with you changing into appropriate attire and then sitting through a training session where you learn some interesting trivia about dolphins and where not to touch them, then you are broken into groups and sent into the water with a trainer. The organization does a great job of ensuring that you will get hands on experience with the dolphin. The trainers are friendly and make sure that you'll have many photo opportunities (but, the resort has a photographer snapping all the shots which you will feel compelled to buy because they're actually quite good).After the 45 minutes with the dolphins, you should definitely take advantage of the rest of the waterpark. Dubai is HOT so you'll enjoy floating along the several water tube rides and may even get brave and ride on some of the larger rides including the leap of faith (very high, quite fast, not that scary). The aquarium and shark exhibits are good and you might want to do the interaction with the manta rays too but we preferred the dolphins.Atlantis is a bit away from the downtown area but worth the trip. Taxis are reasonable (like New York) and typically easy to get. Do not plan to eat at the waterpark since, like most amusement parks, the food is not very good but is very expensive. You are better served to make reservations in a restaurant at Atlantis resort."

            "review": "Great Experience, would highly recommend. However, budget appropriately!. What a great experience! The facilities are magnificent and the way the whole Atlantis park is laid out is great. However, major gripe! Not well sign posted!We did the shallow interaction and were in a group of 7-10. It was however, fine as you got lots of time to touch the dolphin as well as your one on one or couple moments and got half an hour or so in the water. The trainer we had was brilliant, very knowledgeable, entertaining, and had such control over the dolphin it was incredible.Would highly recommend the experience to anyone.However, and this is the thing that I think they could overcome very easily. You book the package you want, great, and pay the money fine. It warns of no photography and that is ok (we were just two so no one watching from the beach). But this is the bit I hadn't put two and two together on. When you finish, you want the photos and in order to get them you have to pay. Now, it is worth it as the photos are great but is expensive (\u00a395-100) for a cd with all images you are in (about 30 in our case) and 3 prints.The thing that annoyed me, is that I wasn't expecting it. If I had have known, I would have allowed for it and I would not have begrudged it at all.Solution: send the photo pricelist with the booking confirmation and make a sales point of it upfront, \"we have professional photographers that will capture your once in a lifetime moment in crystal clear clarity e.t.c.\" Then everyone knows the deal upfront and can't complain.I know I have gone on about it a bit about the photo thing, and maybe it is me being naive, but it just annoyed me a bit. However, what it did not do is ruin the experience which was magical and worth every penny, and now we have the photos to prove it!!"

            "review": "Great experience, just not long enough. Swimming with dolphins was something both me and my husband always wanted to do so we decided to take the opportunity on our honeymoon. We booked the deep water encounter and were not disappointed. Although the introduction and pre-experience quiz is all quite long and drawn out, the time you get in the water with the dolphins is amazing. We were put in a group of 6 and assigned a dolphin and trainer. You get a lot of hands on experience including riding on the dolphin's belly and hugging and kissing it. In total we were in the water about half an hour which gave you a decent amount of time with the dolphin but would have been great if it was just a little bit longer for the amount of money you're paying. One of those once in a lifetime things though! The photos were a bit disapopinting though as they were all action shots, we had our eyes closed or face srewed up in most of them, it would have been nice to get 5 minutes at the end to pose for photos with the dolphin.A major bonus of the package is that it includes access to the Aquaventure park which is a great day out and has rides for everyone."

            "review": "Brilliant experience, but not quite sure whether the 'Roayl Swim' is worth it. Myself and my husband just recently did this as we were in Dubai for our honeymoon and we have always wanted to swim with the dolphins. We did the 'Royal Swim', which was great but not as great as they sell it on the website. You only get to actually swim with the dolphins just the once and then all the other 'things' you do with the dolphins are covered in the dolphin adventure, so if you can live without the actual swim, just save a few quid and go for the encounter/adventure. The free pass into the aqua venture makes going to swim with the dolphins a fun day out, so that's def a bonus you get the pass. There is a photgrapher who takes photos of you....warning...the cost of the pictures are extortionate!!! If you're with someone who is there on a observer pass, get them to take pictures of you. We just got on with it and paid the money for the photos, but the price is mad...to be expected I guess in a 5* hotel!"

            "review": "Excellent experience for the whole family. This was a fantastic way to spend a day in Dubai. A ticket included entry to the Atlantis Waterpark, as well as the dolphin experience. The dolphin experience was great for kids and adults alike. After a half-hour induction where you learnt about the dolphins which you would shortly get to meet, you were then split into groups of ten and assigned a dolphin and a trainer. This small number, meant that in the hour-long session, you were able to have a lot of interaction with your dolphin. This interaction included dancing with the dolphin, hugging it, throwing it a ball and kissing it. Throughout the whole experience, a photographer was in the water with you, catching these moments on camera (although these photos were at a price). However, there was also the option for family members to take photos (although the distance did require a good camera for this to be possible!) and again, this was at high extra cost! With these hidden extras, it does not end up being a cheap day out, however, it was worth every penny, and I would definitely both do this again, and recommend it to others!"

            "review": "Once in a lifetime experience. We (husband, wife and son aged 14) went to Dolphin bay at Atlantis the Palm, Dubai for the deep water interaction.It was great fun and wonderful to be so close to a magnificent creature. We learnt a lot about dolphins too. It was our son's birthday and he was totally thrilled. Included in the price is the water park admission (aquaventure) with great water rides etc. Although it costs about 150-200 pounds per person (depending on exchange rate) it was well worth it as we had a full day of activities plus the chance to be very close to a dolphin. We had previously been on diving trips to see them and been unlucky.Dolphin bay also do a shallow water interaction which is similar to the deep water interaction for people who can't swim or for younger children. Dolphin bay is about 20-30 minutes walk from the water park so allow enough time to reach it. Well worth going to dolphin bay."

            "review": "Great - expensive experiance. The Dolphin Bay attraction is a very nice activity to do if you are in Dubai. it requiers early booking and its non refundable if less than two weeks. you will get to get in full contact with trained Dolphins and feed them and swim with them if you have no kids. you will be in a group of 10 ( which is alot in my opinion ) I was lucky to be total 5 in my group but I thinks its not common - we were the last five to be assigned with a trainer so we were grouped. you will not regret doing this especially if you were in a small group. its a bit expensive about USD 300 for me, my wife and 2 years old girl ( all same fare ) you are not allowed to have a camera while your with the Dolphins but a camera man will be taking all sorts of photos you can buy after your done, about USD 40 for 1st photo and 18 for any additional ones. They are expensive but worth a try"

            "review": "An excellent experience!. I'd never experienced a Dolphin interaction before, so staying at the Atlantis Palm for our honeymoon proved an exciting opportunity. The price (a \"Ramadan Special\", although I'm unsure how this rate differs outside of Ramadan) seemed very reasonable, at 495 AED.I was slightly taken aback that it would cost us another 100 AED for my wife (who swam with Dolphins herself on a previous holiday, so didn't mind sitting out to take photos!) to view from the shore, but decided it would be worth it for the photos.The orientation was excellent - not only did we get given the expected safety information, but also some interesting facts and information about Dolphins themselves, and the ones we'd be meeting.We were very clearly told that photography was permitted, but that videoing the experience was not allowed. The beach area for observers was as close as you could get to the water without getting wet - it would never have been possible to take those kinds of photographs from the waiting area - and shaded sun loungers were provided.The interaction itself felt very personal, even though there were several other people in the group with each dolphin. We each got to kiss and hug the adorable creature, smooth its surface and play with it - throughout which the staff were happy to answer any questions we had.After a group pose with the dolphin jumping behind us, we were taken back inside for complimentary(and very much needed) refreshments, and the chance to chat further with the trainers there.The photographs taken by the staff didn't seem all that different from the ones my wife was able to take, and they were certainly pricey (despite being discounted after the first two). It was certainly worth paying the 100 AED for us to have our own to do with as we liked!My father-in-law paid several times what we paid for an interaction for my wife in Florida, and she told me afterward that both the orientation and interaction itself were longer and more involved than the experience she'd had!Pros:- Informative staff and orientation- Excellent up-close interaction with a dolphin- Complimentary refreshments afterward!Cons:- Pricey photographs / paying to take your ownAdditionally, the fact that a portion of all proceeds went to the foundation who ran the centre was a heart-warming touch!"

            "review": "Dolphin Bay Rip Off. Very Excited about visiting this attraction.We went along looking forward to not only meeting a dolphin but having some photos and video to show friends and family.The booking form said no photos and video but when we arrived and asked staff there we were told it was fine and you could take them to the beach side of the facility.Great! Left the tiny low res camera filming from the sun lounger on a mini tripod. We waded into the water and met Alice the dolphin.Upon returning to the hotel and watching the video we saw that the staff had gone over to it and switched it off, without permission or even asking or telling us.The interaction was great and the trainers were pretty good but to be forced to buy their photos at a really high price. \u00a355 for 4 pictures. Mmmm, thats worth it. And no video of the experience? Not great from such a prestigious hotel.I have wrote to them and they couldn't care less. \"you were told no filming and thats our policy, our staff did not touch the camera\"So they called me a liar too.You tube has the video evidence.We were so upset and disappointed and the attitude of the Kerzner company has been awful.Be Warned! You will love the dolphin but you won't be able to share it with anyone."
