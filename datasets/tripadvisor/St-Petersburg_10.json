The pictures in the brochure etc showed girls in classical white ballet dresses, but we got a stark black and red production of a version of Carmen, with dancing and cheap sets which looked like a production from an old movie,The second short ballet involved two people, a chair and mime.the theatre itself has impossible seating on the flat lower area. Seats are one behind the other, and all on one level, so if you are more than two or three rows back, you can see very little. Our vision was blocked 85-95%.Get seats on an upper level.Toilets are up stairs, there are very few toilets and long queues, so not sure what you do if you have a bladder problem!We were appalled that Holland America did not make it clear what the seating and programme were. We felt ripped-off all round!"

You don't have to know ballet to be intrigued by these highly professional ballet dancers.Lovingly restored house for ballet and opera.Can easily be reached by a nice stroll along Griboyedov canal from Nevsky Prospekt. Be aware the ensemble has holiday in July and August. During summer visiting ballet and opera groups from other cities perform.No dress code.Foreigners pay double price for tickets. Don't try to fool the staff by paying domestic tickets. They will catch you. I have tried.You can buy tickets on the Internet or in special shops selling tickets for all cultural events. Your hotel might be able to help you. Sell outs are common. Try to plan in advance If you want to enrich your soul with fantastic ballet.Same ticket prices wherever you buy the tickets."

            "review": "Fascinating!. The Mariinsky Theatre is a historic theatre of opera and ballet (called the Mariinsky Ballet and Mariinsky Opera) and home to Mariinsky Orchestra in Saint Petersburg. It became the preeminent music theatre of late 19th century in Russia. Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov premiered their stage masterpieces here.The Mariinsky Ballet is the resident classical ballet company of the Mariinsky Theatre. A few years after the first Russian dance school, the Imperial Theatre School, began in 1738, the Mariinsky Ballet started. It is one of the world's leading ballet companies owned a leading international ballet school, the Vaganova Ballet Academy. Tonight we did enjoy the Ballet show (Don Quixote) and sensed the magnificent atmosphere."

This impression changes as its interior decor turns into a sheer delight. Once in, you\u2019ll notice yourself a part of a multicultural beau monde eager to be amazed. Just a few minutes into a performance you\u2019ll see a change in the eyes and faces of people around you. A grumpy looking grey-haired man in a tuxedo will vigorously clap, exclaiming \u201cBravo, bravo!\u201d, and a northern beauty with slightly cold features will gently smile through tears. It was here that famous prima-ballerina Anna Pavlova, at the age of 8, chose her destiny after watching \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty\u201d for the first time in her life. And it was here where she danced her debut.Book tickets for opera or ballet in advance as they are highly desirable and it\u2019s very common to spot theatre-lovers desperately inquiring for an extra ticket at the entrance, just minutes away from performances."

The ballet itself was amazing, but although we had mid priced seats, because of how the boxes are organised, but the time people who knew better had organised their chairs, we could barely see. So an immense disappointment and we would probably have been better going to the modern theatre. Apart from the theatre itself, the interval cafe was a delightful relic of days gone by."

You just cannot find the quality of Russian ballet elsewhere. Then when you hold it in a historic hall such as the Mariinsky, with such wonderful acoustics, seating and atmosphere, it makes a night to remember. Get your tickets on line, so you can get good seats. The hotels have seats, but normally not very good ones. It is a memorable evening - never to be forgotten!"

We were not as concerned with what performance we saw, we primarily wanted to experience the majesty and ambience of the old theatre itself. So that we had good seats and didn\u2019t miss out we made sure we booked tickets in advance. We booked through the website: Mariinsky-Theatre.com. This website emailed us when the playbill was available, about three months in advance, and provided a discount when booking. Although the tickets were pricey we had great seats and return taxi rides were included in our ticket price. We were in the original Mariinsky Theatre which was stunning. It was a wonderful experience to be able to sit in this ornate, elegant gilded theatre. Our seats were Belle Etage Box 12, Row 1, Seat 1 and 3, right next to the original Tsar\u2019s box which was not in use. We were in the front row of the box and had a great view of the whole stage. Although our seats were odd numbers we were seated together. The seats themselves were quite firm and not very comfortable. Something to be mindful of when booking tickets is the majority of the theatre has flat seating, not tiered, making viewing difficult if you have someone tall in front of you. Before the performance, we went to the caf\u00e9 on the second floor for a nice pre theatre drink. While there we also arranged to reserve a table for intermission with pre ordered drinks and caviar sandwiches which were waiting for us when we arrived.There was not a ballet being performed during our stay so we saw the opera \u201cL\u2019Elisir D\u2019Amore\u201d by Gaetano Donizetti. It was performed in Italian with Russian subtitles. A wonderful evening in a stunning setting. Would definitely recommend a visit."

The prices from the booking agents seemed quite high and knowing that you pay about an extra third when using agents in London I tried to see how to book with the theatre directly but without speaking Russian it seemed impossible. Unfortunately we were away when the programmed was released but the company I had chosen to book through was still offering discounts. As it was a once in a lifetime experience we wanted good seats. We were confined by our dates on our visas, so the only ballets available were Don Quixote and the graduation performance by Marinsky students at 1200. We also booked opera tickets for Marinskiy 2.The booking company offered us complementary taxis to and from the performances, which turned out to be very useful, as our biggest hassles in St Petersburgh were with taxi drivers, even worse than the crowds, we took to the buses in the end!!We had seats in the front row second tier middle to side boxes, so an excellent view of the stage and orchestra. I was surprised by the horse and donkey that brought Don Quioxote and Pancho Sanchez onto the stage, they behaved exceeding well. I was also surprised by the chorus of children who danced on points, Google tells me that they start in Russia at the age of 8.There were some amazing dancers and the whole production was excellent as were the orchestra, 6 double bases for Don Quioxote and sets. The 2 x half hour intervals did extend the performances somewhat, though we enjoyed our prosecco and salmon caviar during the evening performance interval. We would have had the caviar again at the lunch time performance but they had run out but the time we arrived at the front of the queue.I did keep our tickets to work out what the agent's mark up was, but life's too short and we had enjoyed the experience very much. The theatre is so typical of that era with its scalloped boxes."

The whole idea of going to Mariinsky Theatre was to treat my parents, my husband and my mother-in-law to an unforgettable opera performance in the heart of Saint Petersburg for which we travelled all the way from Ireland. The theatre itself is of course spectacular and performance was amazing! But! And a huge and very upsetting but! I accidentally printed out the wrong page for my tickets (since I ordered them online in Ireland), but instead of helping me to get the right page or even assist me in any way in trying to figure out the issue, the woman working on the day in the ticket window abused me, then accused me of purchasing my tickets God knows where, she continued being incredibly rude to me despite seeng that I was in total shock and terribly upset by the whole situation, she then threw the page I printed out into my face and sent me rudely off to an administrator who first didn't really want to help me despite me showing her that I had definitely purchased and most importantly paid for my tickets. She only decided to help when she heard me saying that we were from Ireland, which shouldn't really matter as all customers should be appreciated. At the end, the matter was resolved and we attended the amazing performance, but an unpleasant impression unfortunately is going to stay with us for a very long time."

Also read the affiches for the announcements of the operas, ballets.This Mariinskiy Theatre is above all known by setting on the stage the masterpieces of Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky and Rimsky - Korsakov.During the Soviet era, the theatre was known under the name of Kirov Theatre.Maybe some other time we'll chance to get ourselves within this temple of the beautiful art."

The Scottish set in the first part is so kitsch with bambis on the walls, kilts, sporrans, and all that it makes your eyes hurt (try a fouett\u00e9 saut\u00e9 wearing a long kilt and sporran). The second part in the forest was not so bad, you felt the decorator of the first set had died from exposure to his own terrible taste and been replaced by an obsessive compulsive who thought that a hundred trees could not possibly be enough (surprisingly enough he stopped at squirrels, owls et al.). Why on earth are producers allowed to torture dancers (and singers) with their abominable \"ideas\"? When will they be put in their proper place as humble SERVANTS of the real artists? Not every one can be a Peter Brook. The inside of the theatre is in splendiferous, over-the-top, putti-ridden, gilt-to-death XIXth Century taste."

The Mariinsky complex consists of three main theaters; the other two (Mariinsky II and the Concert Hall) are modern, excellent halls. The original theater unfortunately has major problems if you actually want to see a ballet there. I saw three ballets in this theater on my recent visit, and all three (at the top-level prices, I might add) had uncomfortable seats and terrible nightlines. The final night, I was in the center of the orchestra 8th row, and my view was 85% blocked -- I could not see anything on the center stage at all. Sitting there, unable to see ANYTHING, I got so frustrated that I went to management at intermission and asked for a refund. The Mariinsky is OK charging foreigners 3x the price Russians pay, but it is not OK providing any of the customer service that would normally be assumed by people paying the highest price for tickets. This is really unfortunate, as the ballet company is arguably the best in the world, and everything about the performance is fabulous -- but it doesn't do you any good if you can't see, and the theater's management more or less told me to go tell it to Stalin, whereupon I canceled my plans to revisit next year.If you are seeing a non-visual performance there, it will be fine, as long as you don't mind being uncomfortable."

Ticket office was already quite busy at opening time and only one lady was on duty! Mariinsky 2 is a fabulous new theatre. Comfortable seating!! Not too hot! We had a marvellous view! Ballet was absolutely outstanding and musicians played wonderfully. Amazing to be able to walk into town past Tchaikovsky's house!! No obvious cafe or bars here (although we may not have found them) so it would be wise to take a bottle of water with you if the management do not mind! Fabulous displays of original costumes in hall foyer. This visit to see Kirov was the icing on the cake for our visit to St Petersburg!"

The spirit of the place is most fascinating, it is a part of history and culture of St. Petersburg. It is so good that the building is not renovated, not changed. No artificial gold, no cheap decorations. Original, genuine piece of art. I wish that local people and guests of St. Petersburg appreciate more this beautiful and aristocratic place, and support its style by proper dress code like it is in European classical Opera houses. Too democratic style is not in harmony with the elegance of the place. Shurale ballet was a bright performance of a folk fairy tale, perfectly expressed in music and art of dancing. I cannot compare it with breaking your emotions Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet or with magics of Chaikovsky's Nutcracker... BUT if you want to enjoy a bright and jolly holiday and feel happy and relaxed, I recommend this pretty and most attractive performance. If you want a wonderful family evening, Shurale is your choice. Not a single gloomy face! All smiling, all happy.

The navigation is slightly difficult and the fact that male and female toilets are on separate floor is super annoying. On the other hand, there's an abundance of buffets in the whole building and they are highly sought after as pauses were made between each of the acts.The scene and the magnificence of the production was splendid, it's really worth seing an epic opera here. However the performance was not perfect, The singer who sung Amneris was weak until the end of the final act where she excelled and it made me even more sad about her performance: why couldn't she sing that way during the entire performance? Radames was great, the titular Aida good but also with something left to be desired. It's a pity, because I expected more and was left with less."

Further back your view of everything becomes too narrow, so do not take these. As for a romantic moment nothing beats this. We went to see Don Quijote. If you have not proposed to your girlfriend yet, Do it here! They should have made it easier to get drinks in pause! We stayed in the special room of the Lodge as it was rather chaotic on the outside."

The Imperial drama, opera and ballet troupe in Saint Petersburg was established in 1783, at the behest of Catherine the Great, although an Italian ballet troupe had performed at the Russian court since the early 18th century. Two years ago the theatre got new large building just behind the historical one. The auditorium is excellent: light wood balconies, fine acoustics and superb sightlines. Within the airy interior are beige marble and Swarovski crystal lights, with backlit walls of translucent onyx and picture windows affording city views. Presently, the Company lists on its roster 22 sopranos (of which Anna Netrebko may be the best known); 13 mezzo-sopranos (with Olga Borodina familiar to US and European audiences); 23 tenors; eight baritones; and 14 basses."

Six months before we left for Russia I starting checking the Mariinskiy theater's website. So was very disappointed not to be able to go inside. Backstage tours of Mariinskiy I were prohibitively expensive so I just learned what I could on line. Valery Gergiev is world famous and I have seen him conduct operas at the Met--so I was doubly disappointed that I could not see him in action in his theater where he is the General Artistic Director. There is a very interesting video of both buildings on line and equally interesting essays in the New York Times regarding the building of Mariinskiy II. When we actually drove by M II our St Petersburg guide called it a shopping mall, relating that most citizens of the city did not like the new building. I thought they were both beautiful--certainly different from each other. Will be sure to visit next time during the season as I am convinced Russia does ballet and opera better than most."

We purchased our tickets ahead of time on their website and were able to pick our seats from the seating chart. We sat in the first level of balconies in a box. The theater gets rather warm and the seats are close together, so dress accordingly. We sat knee to knee with other patrons on regular straight-backed chairs rather than what is commonly found in theaters. The orchestra and corps de ballet were phenomenal. If you have a chance either before the show or during an intermission, try to get to the small museum display on the same level as the first level of balconies. There were lovely costumes and photos from the history of the theater and its ballet troupe.One suggestion I have is to bring rubles to spend at the theater. They have beautiful snacks and drinks at the snack bar which all of the locals enjoy. In addition, if you want a program as a souvenir, you will need to buy one. There is a small but lovely gift shop as well."

The sense if history and the pride, love and support for the arts by the Russian people is practically palpable. I am sure that we took more selfies our ourselves in the theatre that night than the rest of the 5 days in the city!! My advice would be to always order tickets in advance (the summer months are especially busy and traditional Russian ballet productions sell out), always buy from the official Mariinsky website, dress up a bit for the occasion, and if in the balcony stalls, always get the front row chairs (second row is NOT raised, but third is). Yes the seats can be slightly uncomfortable, but hey, you are not on your couch at home - you're at the Mariinsky! And yes, the (yummy!) food and drink is somewhat pricey compared to City Grill Express, but have you tried to buy a bag of popcorn at a movie theatre lately??? The theatre cafe is a beautiful bargain of wonderful delights in comparison. Don't miss going to the old Mariinsky!"

Be sure to buy/order tickets in advance because it could easily happen that everything is sold out. If you are visiting Mariinsky for the first time take note to visit old building of the theatre not the new one which was build couple of years ago and looks too modern. There are some snacks and drinks available inside but rather pricey, so my advise is to have a dinner afterwards in some restaurant nearby."

The interior of the theatre is beautiful with several levels of curved boxes adorned with gold leaf that shimmers in the light. There is a very large proscenium with an elaborately decorated show curtain that opens to reveal a huge stage.It's too bad the audience didn't rise to the level of the building. Once the house lights dimmed and the curtain rose the mostly Russian audience continued to talk to each other and take photos and videos on their phones. The lights from the many phones were quite distracting and took away from the beauty of the production.The ballet was in 3 acts and as we needed to return to our ship by a certain time we knew we would not be able to stay through the whole performance as the 2 intermissions lasted for over an hour. Not wanting to get up in the middle of the 3rd act we decided to move closer to the exit doors where there were extra loose seats available. There was a lovely \"ballerina\" type girl sitting by the door and I thought she might like our seats as they were much better than hers. I asked her if she spoke English and offered her my seats. The nasty look on her face and extremely dismissive wave of her hands was quite surprising. I then offered the seats to another woman who did not acknowledge that I was even speaking to her. So we left our seats empty and moved to the the seats by the door. I then noticed the 2nd woman moving into our seats so I guess she understood what I had said to her.The third act was still going on when we had to exit the theatre and it was quite difficult to find the door-handle and turn it in the dark. It was not a push bar as required in the US.Once we were in the inner lobby we found all the exit doors locked. After trying several doors one of the ushers who were sitting there pointed to the last door which was open. We then found all of the outer lobby doors to be locked with heavy chains around them with the only door open being one at the opposite end of the lobby. After exiting the theatre we began to think about the fact that we were in a huge building filled with wooden furniture, draperies and hundreds of people while all the doors were chained shut. Not a pleasant feeling.Our driver picked us up in the still pouring rain and returned us to the ship.We were quite happy when the ship pulled away from the dock and left Russia behind."

It's wonderfully old-fashioned and traditional - individual chairs to sit on, lots of the original boxes for seating in several of the five (!) circles, loads of separate tiny bars for each floor, individual chandeliers providing much of the lighting, big bouquets for the principal dancers at the end of each piece and for the conductor or accompanist. Fairly upmarket and pricey too, with champagne and strawberries and rich gateaux in the intervals. Lots of the audience were dressed-up, particularly in the expensive seats in the stalls, though you don't feel out of place if you're more casually dressed. And the ballet is superb of course, as you'd expect, as is the full orchestra. It's worth remembering to take binoculars or opera glasses if you've got them, though.... the various circles are some way from the stage."

We saw a performance of Anna Karenina, which was a perfect if not conventional choice. Getting the tickets was fairly traumatic - we went to the theatre and stood in the queue for a good hour, gradually getting closer to the ticket office until we made it to the front, when an announcement was made (in Russian). Everyone abruptly moved to the next ticket office and the ticket booth window was slammed in our faces, so we had to move to the back of the same queue we'd just made it to the front of!Nevertheless, we got our tickets and the performance was worth it. The theatre is exquisitely beautiful, there was a live orchestra, which was a real treat and the ballet was the stuff of a little girl's dreams."

Do not get the seat next to the tsars box in the first gallery circle or you will be staring partially at a gold part of the Tsars box. Also here the second row is on the same level as the front row and there is virtually no leg room, I strongly advise not to get second row seats. Third row is in fact better as it is raised. Having run around the other galleries most of the front row seats seem fine but of course the angle is steeper and very steep at the 3rd gallery. Cloakroom, food, drinks all available .

We got a great piece of advice from Tripadvisor which I am going to repeat here, which is that if you buy seats in the First Circle, go for the front row or the third (a few boxes towards the middle have a raised area at the back for this), but avoid the second row because you won't see so well. The Russian sparkling wine was great, and at 200 roubles a glass a much better bet than 5,000 for a bottle of NV Moet et Chandon.Anyway, the sight lines were fine and the theatre is a stunner to sit in. Compared to what I expected after reading other reviews, dress wasn't too overwhelming - smart casual really will be fine and you'll fit in. At least, you'd have fitted in on our Wednesday night performance of Don Quixote. Dancing was of course astonishing. About \u00a340 each for very good tickets. You won't get better value in London or New York."

I prefer going to the Russian Operas ( you get subtitles in English) as some of the Russians singing the Italian parts can be a surprising disappointment. Dress well - Russians dress up and you will definitely feel underdressed if you are not up to scratch. If taking children check the age limit before buying tickets as it varies for each show. If you love theatre this is a must even if just to sit and enjoy the grandeur, but do your homework well in choosing - not all shows are great - read the reviews."

The theatre is stunning, letting you walk around it in the interval. We researched the story of the opera before hand however, did not need it as they had english subtitles at the top of the stage.

My interest was the original older building and I loved the architectural design and got some great photographs.This location is opposite the St Isaac's Cathedral which made an easy visit to do the two at the same time. I took a pre-arranged car from my hotel at a reasonable price for a business associate and myself and enjoyed the convenience of being dropped right outside and snapping a few pics and then back in the car again.It's a magnificent building, has a great history and I was delighted to have visited it."

Finally, we were able to purchase 'parterre' tickets for A\u00efda and were anticipating a lovely evening - on a par at least with the Opera in Paris or the Met in New York..Well, what a let down! Firstly, the seats were of the stiff chaise kind, not fold-over ones, so that every time people came to claim their seats in one's row, it was a convoluted exercise for one to let them pass! Secondly, I do think many spectators (esp.the young) go to this house to see and be seen; their smartphones were switched on most of the time. I saw a woman regularly checking her messages, and another couple checking his! Twice, two women behind us let their phones ring shrilly (and the second time during A\u00efda's plaintive aria 'O Patria mia'). I angrily turned to shush them and at intermission time scolded the younger girl. It is incredible to note that they are all dressed to the nines but do not seem not to have any idea as to how to behave at the opera.The production - it seemed to me - was one taken from mothballed trunks - all very Cecil B. De Mille - the principal singers were fine although the Amonasro seemed a bit fatigued and could not emit all his notes. I was amazed that A\u00efda -who sang better - got one flimsy bouquet while Amneris collected 2 great big ones (btw to me the orchestra only had one tone: loud).Getting to the women's toilets was a military exercise in itself; the theatre is a labyrinth of corridors and stairs and nooks and crannies and no useful signage. But we liked the little 'caf\u00e9s' sprinkled all over where one could get fresh refreshments (there were 3 intermissions after all) and stretch one's legs after sitting in those cramped wooden seats. Regrettably unlike the Op\u00e9ra Garnier, it does not have (we did not see one anyway in the crush of crowds) a long gallery where one could walk around and appreciate the gilded cherubs overhead, nor little balconies where one could people-see while sipping one's glass of champagne!Ahh, there is still nothing to be compared with the Paris Opera; there, spectators immediately switch off their phones, religiously follow each aria (one can hear the proverbial pin drop), and treat the theatre, the work and the artists with the respect and awe they deserve."

Wonderful architecture inside and outside to see. With such history. The opera was put on beautifully. Great production with a great cast who sung very very well. Cons:Unfortunately for us, we saw a German opera. Which had Russian subtitles. And we spoke neither, we saw in the audience for almost 2-3 hours completely bored stiff, as we were unable to comprehend anything. We actually went with some Venezuelan and Spanish friends. And they could not understand German or Russian either. They managed to only sit thru 30-45 minutes worth of the opera before they just got up and left. They couldn't take 2-3 hours of constant German with Russian subtitles. In summary. This is a beautiful building. Worth visiting. Just make sure you see a production that is in a language you understand. Alternatively, you could go see Ballet or Tchaikovsky. That would be much more enjoyable."

I am not a big ballet goer, but fancied a bit of culture for a change. The Mariinsky is home to the today's global choreography of Giselle and has seen many of the World's best known dancers pirouette and plie across its boards.My seat was in the most upper circle, hence the price, and seating was an upholstered bench, so not the most comfortable, but not worth moaning about at the price. Being so high I got a pretty good view of the stage and the dancers, and only the 2 flights on wires were partly obscured.The performance was superb and this was a great experience out of the norm for a business traveller.If you can get a ticket - go see it!"

We had taken dresses and heels and were glad to have made the effort as most people were dressed up.

My first visits I got ticket with ballet&Opera.com and my hotel concierge, they both marked up the true price by 80% - incredible anywhere but probably not for Russia. It is very simple: you first register with the theatre, consult their website and book well ahead in English and paying with credit card. Even if you see a performance that is virtually full, tickets may be further released later. It is very bad that Mariinsky does not release cast till late, unless for superstar shows like Vishneva, but if you consult their website frequently you will see surprises....for example only 3 weeks to show time I found Osipova dancing Giselle and Lopatkina dancing Midsummer Night's Dream just announced (for Oct 2013). Simply, don't buy tickets from a third party unless you want to pay double and can't choose seat as with the thatre direct.......I am returning next month Oct 2013 with good seats in hand paying fair prices...."

And the only one that could fit our schedule as it was our last night in St. Petrsburg. The role of Raymonda was played by Olesya Novikova. We got tickets direct from the Mariinsky box office thru the internet which costs Roubles 500 each. We were seated at the stalls middle row 2 which was very near the stage so we can see even the faces of the dancers quite clearly. We almost bought our tickets from a website which were selling the tickets at more than 5 times the box office price. Good we learned that we can buy the tickets direct from the Mariinsky website. It was exciting to be at the theatre if only because of it's rich history and it's reputation as Russia's premiere ballet theatre together with the Bolshoi. The play itself was quite old fashioned and to be honest, somewhat politically incorrect (with a dark moor being the villain). While Olesya was a very good dancer, I thought she lacked expression. Afterwards, we headed back to the hotel in our pre-arranged privately- owned BMW ( there appears to be no taxis in Russia) which we hired courtesy of our hotel doorman.

Two days before the performance we were told that all tickets were sold out. We were nearby on the day of the performance and made one final enquiry and found that two tickets were available in Box D which was a central box about halfway up with a good view. Price was 3400 Roubles about \u00a368 each and it must be said that the seats are much wider than usual and very comfortable. They have a wide selection of quality refreshments available but the queue for the ladies restrooms was as bad as ever. The opera was first class and it's delivery surpassed even the highest expectations. Don't give up at the first hurdle as perseverance often pays off."

There are 3 stages now: an old stage in a gorgeous historical building, a brand new stage 2 in ugly modern building nearby, and concert hall, which is also not far from the old stage. The best time to visit is May-July during \"White Nights festival\". The ballets are traditionally very good, thanks to principal conductor Valery Guerguiev, the operas are getting better and better. The best musicians come to play in the concert hall. The best way to get tickets is via Internet. The Mariinski theatre\u2019s website is in Russian and English, there you can find the playbill, information on shows, synopsis, and can easily buy tickets with you credit card (it is safe, I personally did it several times). Do not forget to check if you need Russian visa beforehand."

Practicalities: Tickets were booked online in advanced and printed out, meaning that we did not have to go to the ticket office but walked straight in - recommended. (This was during the Star of the White Nights Festival) We were seated at the top level (3rd gallery) and in the 3rd row, tickets cost us 800 rubles. Beforehand, I was worried about the view but it wasn't too bad. It wouldn't have been a problem at all except for the fact that the women in front of me kept leaning forward and blocking a part of the stage. Luckily there were some extra seats and in the first intermission we moved higher up towards the center. This meant we were nearly on the roof, but the view was still fine. I would recommend getting seats in the center section, not the side-wings. If you are in the middle, sitting on the top balcony is OK. But of course if you can afford it, go for seats closer to the stage. I would guess being on the \"Belle Etage\" or the 1st gallery is excellent. You can see the pictures I took from my seat below.Experience:Having never seen a live classical ballet before I wasn't sure what to expect, especially when I learned the show would all in all take 3 hours. My boyfriend and I had talked about the possibility of leaving during intermission if we found it boring. Needless to say, it never came to that. We saw the Swan Lake and enjoyed it through and through, marvelous performance and beautiful music in the charming surroundings of the old Mariinsky."

Our only complaint were two young women in our box (Russians, I think) who kept taking pictures with their iPad and talking throughout the performance - at least they came late, missing Act 1, and left before the last Act!

I went to see Swan Lake and the scale of the performance is probably more impressive than the quality of the dancing - I counted 40 dancers, an orchestra of about 30 but also a few mistakes! The theatre is small, u-shaped and there isn't much banking, so it is probably better to get a front row seat in the middle on a lower balcony. If you are behind someone slightly taller than you in the stalls then your view is obscured. I think the balconies are cheaper than the stalls too. However, don't go for the balcony seats near the stage as you can't see too much due to the angle.All of the seats are effectively dining room chairs which get pretty uncomfortable after 3 hours! There isn't much air conditioning so in the height of summer it probably gets a little unpleasant. Drinks and snacks are expensive (150 roubles for 250ml of water) and the queues can be long but the intervals lasted about 25 minutes during our show and that seemed normal given it ended on time. Have a wander around the inside of the building during the interval as there are lots of interesting nooks and crannies.Having said all of that, it's a good experience and in the summer you get the bizarre experience of exiting into broad daylight after a 3 hour evening performance!"

Opened just recently the new venue became a loving toy for the city inhabitants and its guests: very comfortable for the guests (a lot of modern elevators, stairs, cloak rooms, cafeterias) and presenting marvelous views to the city from the lobby windows! And - not the last to be mentioned- the best sound in the main hall (at least in Russia and, probably, in Europe) and very technically assisted scene and scene light. The opening of the Mariinsky II became a great world opening and provides great opportunity for visiting StPetersburg (see gold-light-emanating onix-marble walls of the main halls at the picture)."

The Imperial box still glitters extravagantly; the curtains and chandeliers breathe opulence. No ice cream at the interval - Champagne, caviar and smoked salmon still reign supreme. And by the way, it's not expensive if you have the sense to book direct with the Mariinsky. Shame on the websites which exploit the overseas tourists."

I had prepurchased my ticket on the official Mariinski website. My seat was in the \"Dress Circle Box A\". There is no view of any part of the stage from these seats unless one stands up or, alternatively, leans over the balcony. They are the worst seats in the house and, for the price, probably the worst seats in a modern concert hall anywhere in the world. At the interval I complained at the information desk and was given a seat in the second row of the amphitheatre for the second act - this was theatre in the round and it was great fun to sit on the edge of the stage within touching distance of the performers. Sitting next to me was a young American who lives in St Petersburg. Because he is fluent in Russian he is able to buy tickets at Russian (i.e. non-foreigner) prices. His ticket cost 800 rub. Mine cost 6,480 rub (\u20ac162).The following night I attended the venerable old Mariinski Opera House. This I arranged through the concierge at the Astoria. The show was sold out but the hotel has an excellent box and my front row box seat cost me \u20ac125."

The new building is still not finished, but they were clearly fitting it out when we went; not sure what future arrangements will be, so make the most of the traditional building. The auditorium is smaller than we expected (much smaller than Covent Garden, and not as high as the Coliseum) but that means you get a very good view (as long as you are on the front row). Circulation space is not huge, or particularly grand, but an entertaining warren of arches and staircases.We saw \"La Bayadere\" which was outstanding, and \"Anna Karenina\" which was much better than on DVD. Both productions were very good and very well-danced, and the acoustic is very good. It really is a pretty auditorium, shades of peacock-blue and gold.You can get a cast-list and synopsis in English if you ask for it (though most of the staff have little English).The shop turned out to be very disappointing (and only accessible from behind the stalls). No doubt that will change in the new building.We walked to and from the theatre; the scrum for buses coming away was terrible. That will all get much easier when the new Metro station is completed, but I've no idea when that will be.One gets the impression that the company have had to sharpen up a bit now that the Mikhailovsky have improved so much, and I wouldn't put much between them."

Tickets are easily purchased online (a big benefit over Moscow's Bolshoi) and collecting them at the box office on the night is just as easy as doing the same in London's West End. The Mariinsky Theatre is looking very tired but renovations are planned once the New Mariinsky Theatre is completed in 2013. We had the pleasure of seeing a beautiful and technically brilliant production of Swan Lake. The set was light touch which was a nice change to the Royal Ballet and enabled the audience to focus on the dancers. The third act had the finest dancing we've ever seen in Swan Lake, hands down. Tips for attending: - Dress code isn't as formal as it used to be. Similar to London, there's a range from evening dress to jeans. - Don't expect to find a full Mariinsky Shop to buy suvinors on the evening of performances. Apparently there is one, but it closes well before the performance starts (missed opportunity Mariinsky!). - the Theatre is a bit of a distance from the tourist centre. You can catch a bus from Nevsky Prospect but if it's winter, a taxi is worth it. Locals told us that the current Conductor favours Opera and that the ballet has taken a backseat. I hope Mariinsky's management come to their senses - while improving the company's opera is a worthy ambition, lessening their commitment to ballet in anyway would be a mistake. Their reputation as one of the world's greatest ballet companies is a great source of pride and tourism for the city. It'd be a shame to the City and dance to see that lapse."

You can buy tickets on board the bus by a person wearing a neon coloured vest. Get off after about 5 stops (just ask someone on the bus, most of the people are probably going to the same show as you). The bus stopped just outside the theatre.There is a cloak room - some staff will tell you which entrance and cloack room according to your ticket. You can buy wine, beer, soft drinks and small sandwiches and pastries before the show starts. You can't bring the drinks in with you, so be sure to have enough time.We saw Don Quiote with Russian subtitles. I think if they are singing in Russian you get English subtitles.

The theatre is well geared for numbers with plenty of cloakrooms and bars and the seats are proper seats. The decoration in the theatre is splendid but the dance, the dance....."

So we could choose our seats and make sure they were in the center area.We saw Swan Lake with one of their stars, Galina Ulanova and the theatre was packed. Young Russians stood at the back or even on the stairs through the whole performance.For the ballet, we were in the first row of the second balcony from the top. First row was fine-no one blocking your view. The second night we went to an opera and had seats in the second row in the next balcony down. The second row is right behind the first row, no step up. As a short woman, I would have been infuriated to be there for ballet ; of course in ballet you want to see the feet. For opera it was OK though it was stuffy.The theatre itself (which I think they are planning to redo but I do not know the details) has all the gilt and velvet you would expect, as well as ceilings with the ornate moulding no one could afford to pay for nowadays.The evil sorcerer was excellent, very powerful. Ulanova had the strong technique you associate with Russian ballet but not a strong dramatic ability. The corps looked stunning in the third act with their beautiful black and white costumes, but were not perfectly synchronized. But it was thrilling to be in the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg seeing the Mariinsky Ballet doing Swan Lake. How much more quintessentially Russian can you get. When we got out at 11 pm there was still light in the sky."

Before I talk about our experiences a word of advise - do book ahead via the internet if you want to obtain good seats as some shows are fully booked well in advance. Yes, you will pay more than the locals do, but it is still good value compared to other European cities.The Mariinsky is the home of the Kirov ballet and has been made famous in the past by Nureyev & Baryshnikov. We were fortunate enough to have good seats for the opening night of Swan Lake. The production and performers were the best we have ever seen and it made for a special evening.The building itself from the outside is not that special, on the inside, it is quite small which makes for an intimate atmosphere. Go early if you can as the theatre is fun to explore and also has some nice places to eat. I highly recommend going to the Mariinsky even if your not an opera or ballet fan you will find it rewarding."

I'm glad we went twice as it showed how variable the performances can be. The first opera, Love for 3 Oranges, was an outstanding production with great performances from the orchestra and the chorus but variable and some surprisingly weak performances from the soloists. We'd picked the second opera, Pelleas et Melisande, because Gergiev was conducting, per the website. Gergiev was a no show. I'm used to prima Donna soloists being no shows but this was our first experience of a conductor no show. However the orchestra was again excellent and this time the soloists were also excellent and their French diction was better than some French singers we've heard. However the production was weak. The opera house itself is delightful and the local audience significantly younger and more enthusiastic than you'd see at a major opera house in the west. The website is easy to use - no need to go via a third party to get your tickets. The loos are in short supply with long queues so plan ahead. Interval drinks are also a challenge as there is one lady serving everybody in the stalls and first balcony."

Comfortable seats, great sight lines, lots of foyer space, an ability to get interval drinks without queuing, ushers who speak English, programmes in English. Indeed you might be in western Europe or the US except that the evening we were there there were lots of children and people under the age of 30 for classical music, which was great. One of the pieces we heard was a piano concerto. The orchestra was excellent but the piano sounded odd and rather tinny. It is a Steinway. The pianist was excellent.

I was happy to find a performance this short since I was supposed to be on a very early flight out of the city the next morning. The first act was beautifully performed; everything positive that I'd heard about the theater proved to be true (absolutely stunning building that alone is worth the price of admission, amazingly talented performers). Then nothing happened -- for an hour, everyone just sat there waiting for something to happen. After about 45 minutes the audience started clapping / chanting, trying to persuade the performers to continue. I unfortunately had to leave an hour after the first act to catch my aforementioned flight, but as I left there was still nothing going on in the theater. No explanation or announcement was made of any kind. I mentioned what happened to my taxi driver and he basically said that he was sorry that had happened and that it is very typical of performances there. So the bottom line is that it's worth going, but leave yourself FAR more time than is stated on the website if you want to see an entire performance.I was mostly after seeing the building and getting a taste for the ballet (I'm pretty far from a performing arts aficionado). So I got pretty much all I wanted from the performance, but have to knock it back to 2 stars since taking an hour off in the middle of a 45 minute performance without any explanation is bad form."

We saw a Stravinsky \"double header\" during White Nights, and that in itself is rare. Rite of Spring and Firebird. My husband, an orchestral musician, put this on our agenda, mainly so he could hear the orchestra with the ballet. He had never played those pieces with a live ballet, so this gave him a new perspective. We got tickets online prior to our trip. We used the Mariinsky's webiste. I think that some English language sites out there greatly inflate the prices, so just stick with the theater's ticketing site. We picked up our tickets at Will Call without waiting in a long line. Dress: I had read that it is very dressy, but I did not find this to be the case. Dressy casual will work. I had a black travel dress and a black wrap and my husband wore a dress shirt and slacks and we were perfectly dressed. The theater is beautiful. I liked sitting there thinking of all of the famous dancers who have been behind that curtain. We were in the lower balcony, first row. There are individual seats, but they are rather narrow. Also, we were seated close to a \"peak\"- it was like a roof over the entrance to the level below. Hard to describe, but the seats in front of that obstruction would have had limited views. The snack bar on the box seat level has enormously expensive champagne, so be cautioned. We observed some people walk away from their order because they had hoped to pay with credit card, but it was roubles only. The intermission was very long, based on my experience, so there was plenty of time for getting a bite to eat or visiting the WC."

Walking into the main theater my fears were cast off and you see the beautiful fresco, sculptures, and ornate trimming to make a very wondrous space.The chairs have some room between them and are not jammed together to maximize seating. As I looked around I saw that most of the seats and boxes had clear views. I saw a ballet of Le Corsaires. The performance was not highly technical but very fulfilling with a decent story line and good dancing. With a new ballet every night I assume that these are many different companies or mostly understudy. It would be impossible to know a different ballet every night for the whole White Night season. As others have stated there are many people here from cruise ships and they will be using their flash photography even though they are 20 meters from the stage in a dimly lit room. Expect to have the audience gradually get bolder as the performance progresses and the rate of flashes increase.There are small concessionary booths that serve some alcohol and no beer. There are some pastries and quick snacks too. There is a coat check and the ticket booth was organized.I highly suggest buying the tickets online to avoid standing in long lines. The tickets during White Nights will sell out fast as the cruise ships dock."

There's no doubt that the ballet was sensational, I was there watching the swan lake and that was definitely one of the best performance i've seen; the principal dancer Yekaterina Kondaurova's skill was just breathtaking. The problem of my experience was with the audience. As you can imagine, because od the fame of this theatre, it somehow became a tourist trap and started to attract the wrongr people to its wonderful classic performance. The audience was told before the performance started that no videoing or photo shooting would be allowed, yet there were plenty idiots constantly using flash to take their photo. Let's just get this clear: basic photography knowledge, using flash in a dark envionment will never give you a good photo, so using flash just let people know you are ignorant. Second, if you really want to take a photo, at least have the decency to turn off the flash. If you are not smart enough to do that, then maybe classic ballet is not for you?? In addition to using flash, there were also morons who started to applaud before the music stops. Don't they know it's rude? This is classic ballet, not a circus!! I urge all the real classic ballet lovers took a stand against those pretenders, verbally abuse them when they wouldn't follow the rules, it's the only way to save the dignity of this great art!"

Seats are still hard and close together, but they no longer cost a handful of rubles or the equivalent of \u00a33-4. So they cost much the same as the medium price range at the Royal Opera House in London. Black caviar at about \u00a31-2 per large dollop has gone to be replaced with a teaspoonful of red salmon caviar on a tiny blini. One of those and two glasses of so-called champagne (we made the mistake of not asking for \"champnasky\", the Russian sparkling wine and were given a similar tasting product from an open bottle of Moet & Chandon) and no change from \u00a340! So be careful what you ask for at the small kiosks that pass as bars.And theatre goers no longer parade slowly anti-clockwise around the grand salon behind the former imperial box at the interval which is a shame, but we all move with the times.The two ballet performances were superb: imagine 32 ballerinas all on pointe in white and in perfect synch. And all the principal dancers were magnificent.The two operas were disappointingly average. Of the 4 performances we saw only one started and even finished on time with another one over-running by 45 mins to finish just before midnight., but at least it was still daylight outside.Russians seem to expect this and, to encourage late conductors and dawdling orchestra members to take their places, applaud the near empty pit as they would on the entry of the conductor. Unlike 26 years ago many of the staff can cope with directing those with at least some English to their boxes or seats, which is necessary as seat numbers are not intuitive and are hidden on seat backs in the gloom. English versions of the programmes are also available, but, of course, \"surtitles\" are in Russian. Access to seats is still rather last minute.A huge irritation that is the fault of the audience is the flash photography, though banned, throughout the performance. And the blue glow of smart phones and i-Pad type devices among the audience after the house lights are down is intensely distracting and irritating. This is the worst audience behaviour I have experienced.Twenty six years ago, as the Soviet Union was coming to an end though softened by Glastnost and the USSR and much of Europe was anxiously watching the radiation clouds from Chernobyl, a night at the then Kirov to see Tchaikovsky's \"Queen of Spades\", which is set in imperial St Petersburg, was stunningly presented and performed and sung and the whole event was memorable. The Mariinsky seems to me now to be struggling to set a standard except in its wonderful ballet company and for that alone it is worth a visit - and the interior of the auditorium is magnificent."

We bought the tickets online via balletandopera.com. It was a good thing that we got the private taxi transfer from the same website as it was hard to find taxis. The taxi driver arrived on time, one hour before the show. Traffic going to and from the theater was horrible. Upon check-in at our Novotel Hotel in St. Petersburg, we got the theater tickets as they had promised. Tickets were in Russian. We asked the hotel reception to translate the text. It was mentioned that guests should be seated before the 3 rings. Swan Lake ballet started at 7pm. It had three acts. Between acts, they had around 15 minutes intermission. The 3 rings sounded off before the next act started. The show ended at 10:15pm. The same taxi driver arrived 10 minutes later to bring us back to the hotel.We bought the tickets 2 months earlier and got good unobstructed view from Luxe 1 area which the kids really appreciated.Swan Lake ballet at Mariinsky Theater is truly the best! It was a remarkable experience for all for us!"

Saw Swan Lake, having booked the tickets online before we got there - the website was much easier to book than Bolshoi and it is a really a good option if you cannot get tickets to the Bolshoi in Moscow. Afterall, this is the home and birth place Russian ballet. Astounded by the artists, costumes and settings of each scene, this was truly an enjoyable experience. Both the interior and the exterior are impressive. There was still a lot of photography which I don\u2019t think is right. Seating was horrendous \u2013 it is hard to imagine that the seating in the main hall is truly moveable chairs and the entire hall is not graduated and we had people around us trying to ask people in front of them to tilt themselves \u2013 which shows how bad the situation is. The seats are very cramped and small and difficult to manuveur \u2013 so try to get balcony seats. Definitely try to dress up. The bathroom facilities (on 3rd floor for the ladies) are also limited\u2013 so find out the route when you get there if you plan to use them during the break and also be prepared to queue. There is also a very charming restaurant at the corner of the road outside the theatre if you like to get a pre-show dinner."

This was a bit of a challenge as I had to cope with non English speaking staff at the booth and the guy on the door wouldn't let me in at first! I think he was just ensuring that there weren't too many people in the booth.The experience at the ballet was amazing though. We dressed up as did most other people there too. One tip would be to get there early as the traffic is bad at performance times. Also bear in mind that if you don't speak Russian it's quite hard to work out where your seat is! Another thing worth mentioning is that a lady selling gifts tried to overcharge me by as little as 50 roubles by giving me small value coins.Overall though it was a brilliant night and would totally recommend."

Thanks to the long and energetic tenure of the theatre\u2019s incumbent Music Director, Valery Gergiev, international opera lovers have plenty of opportunities to attend performances of the Mariinsky Theatre artistic ensembles on tour around the world. I had already attended performances of this outstanding artistic ensemble in London, Paris and Rome. But this only increased my motivation to attend a performance in their home ground, the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg.The theatre looks a bit run down and in desperate need of an overhaul \u2013 as it was done recently at the Bolshoi in Moscow. But this did not detract anything to the charm of the place.They have an extended repertoire, but I wanted to see a Russian Opera. So I attended a matin\u00e9e performance of \"The Tsar Saltan\" by Rimsky Korsakov, staying clear of the billboard of the many scheduled performances of Italian warhorses like Tosca and Traviata \u2013 which seemed to me to be routine performances of little artistic value, albeit probably very good for the box office.The Mariinsky Orchestra was conducted by a \"maestro sostituto\" and there were no international opera stars among the singers. But I enjoyed the consistently high artistic level and the attendance of a young - I would say very young - audience. Very well behaved in spite of the young age!I booked my tickets from the Theatre website, and that worked out very well. All in all, a moving experience, which I am eager to repeat at the next suitable occasion."

I booked a ticket both for the old famous Mariinsky and for the new Mariinsky concert hall and I have also seen other Russian traditional music performances and operas in other places in the world but this performance exceeded my expectations. Most of the time, when you hear so positive comments, you are afraid to be let down but this was one of my best experiences in life!My tickets were for the Nutcracker, and in this particular ballet performance both children and adults acted. I'm not one of the very emotional persons who constantly cry in movies but I couldn't stop while at this performance and I didn't understand why. I guess because it was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. The ballet dancers were amazing, the costumes, the lighting and the decoration unbelievably well-done. And even though, the music is well-known, within this setting it had a different, more intense feeling. The only disadvantage was the audience that was clapping their hands at some points even while the orchestra was still playing, interrupting the musicians. However, this play was so magical that nothing could have ruined it.Be aware that you have to buy the tickets well in advance, especially if you're visiting the theatre during a high-season (Christmas, Russian White nights). I bought my tickets online from the official website of the Mariinsky theatre about a month and a half before my visit. There is an English version of the website (mariinsky.ru) where you can easily select the seats of your choice. As soon as you purchase the tickets, you should print your e-ticket (which you will find in your online account ) and get the paper tickets when you are in the city (from one of the two Mariinsky theatres or a ticket booth in Nevsky Prospekt - Gostiny Dvor). It's easy and all the details are written in the email that you receive when you buy the tickets.It's not an exclusive attraction for old people only. It targets easily the general audience. You can check the schedule, listen the music online and select what attracts you most. Book tickets now and enjoy! :-)"

Now under the artistic leadership of Valery Gergiev, the theater consistently presents some of the finest performances and productions to be found anywhere. There are actually two theaters, the historic one and a newer one just a block away. As productions range from traditional and opulent to spare and modern, one is well advised to do some research before buying tickets. But here is the most important tip of all: scalper organizations are rampant in St. Petersburg, with prices that are as much as double those of the Mariinsky Theatre itself. Buy direct, save money and get better seats!"

The Opera \"Atilla\" was not one I was familiar with, but I enjoyed it. The stage sets were good and the music lovely. I also saw the \"Romeo and Juliet\" ballet. The principle dancers were fabulous. The chorus was a little off putting as the ladies were wearing pumps with inch high heels rather than ballet slippers. Costumes were the weakest part of both the ballet and the opera. Atilla the Hun in a hot pink shirt was a bit of a shocker. OK, it was the party scene, but still. Romeo had a \"cape\" that wrapped around his legs and almost tripped him a couple of times and the girls skirts were far too long. All the costumes looked very cheap. They seem to have spent money on the stage sets though - they were wonderful for both performances. Finally, I booked online months in advance and was horrified when I discovered my seat had an obstructed view. I'm used to theaters that mention this when you book. I could easilly have chosen another seat if they had labelled it as partially obstructed. Fully one third of the stage was missing. To charge full price for a seat where you can only see 2/3 of the performance takes some real cheek. Overall, it was still worth going, but chose your seats wisely."

Naturally the enjoyment of the performance will vary but having attended both venues in successive evenings we preferred the Mikhailovsky. (It is confusing as prior to 2007 it was known as the Mussorgsky).The Mikhailovsky is equally historic, grand, perhaps just a little less ornate, but more intimate. the staging and acoustics are equivalent. It is better situated in Arts Square with more options for pre and post dining. The pricing is comparable (astonishingly cheap) but the ticketing, on-line PDF printing, superior. The bar at the Mikhailovsky is massively better with loads of buzz, champagne, open sandwiches and stunning deserts, and cheaper than the Mariinsky. The 100 page programme for RUB 150 is bilingual and international standard compared with the village hall photo copy at the Mariinsky. I am going to say it but the audience is cooler at the Mikhailovsky. We saw Swan Lake and there were loads of Russian families dressed up to the hilt. Our night at the Mariinsky was rammed with coach parties.The Mikhailovsky just seemed a bit more special...."

The cruise line excursion included transportation which was a big relief. The trip to and from the theatre, and the long days of summer solstice allowed easy photography from the bus with interesting light effects in the gloaming. The theatre itself has an impressive lobby with sculptures and paintings. Inside the main theatre the seating and adornments to the house were minimal, more like a movie theatre than a grand opera house. The performance we saw was only half full.The ballet itself, Giselle, was performed the the Kirof young company and they did a competent job. Costumes and musical accompaniment was also acceptable if not inspiring. Unintentional humour came from a cheap, purchased program which had some of the most inventive English translations I've ever seen. As a cultural event it was over-priced, but at least you got the sense of what the Russian public consider as high-brow entertainment."

We went to the ballet Romeo&Juliet of Prokofiev buying two of the last 6 tickets on the day of the performance! We had heard and was advised to buy tickets ahead since most of the performances were selling off, it really was, but we managed to get in :)Inside the theater is amazing! The curtains, the ceiling.. The performance was very good, you understand why Russian ballet is so famous around the world. The people are dressed up and you see the locals also give very much care to this event. For example we saw a 9-10 year old boy dressed in white shirt, tie and blazer jacket, this gave me the impression that locals care much about it, even bringing their kids in proper dresses. Since we bought last minute tickets, and didn't have time to return to our hotel near the airport and dress up, we remained relatively very casual. One of the ladies helping (warning actually :)) people to find their places stopped us while we were climbing to the floor our seats were, and said somethings in Russian. Seeing we stare at her not understanding, she pointed at our clothing and our coats in hand still in Russian and said \"you're in Mariiiiinnnnssy Theater!\" (behave yourselves! kind of..), I couldn't help smiling and saying \"thank you but please don't beat us!\" :) When we got out it was 22:30 pm but the sky hadn't gone dark yet because of the white nights :) It's something one's not used to experience after an evening performance.Last words; Do go to Mariinsky Theater and experience the atmosphere as well as the performance."

The ballet company really was as good as their reputation. We're not sure enough can be said about the quality and experience provided by the Mariinsky Ballet Company. While our tickets were expensive at 5000 Ruble ($175 USD) per ticket, it seems so very well spent on the evening we watched them perform Swan Lake. We recommend trying to secure the Belle Etage, upstairs box seats. They were the perfect level to really get the best of your Mariinsky experience. We are already thinking of another trip to St. Petes, the Mariinsky will be a first on the list of attractions to repeat. We highly recommend trying to watch a production of some sort here, hopefully you can secure ballet tickets."

We had no problems getting our tickets, we just brought the e-mail confirming that we had bought the tickets to the box office 2 hours before it started and were handed the tickets. The theatre is beautiful inside. We felt under dressed as most people dress up but there were quite a few tourists in there so we weren't the only ones in jeans and trainers thankfully. The staff were friendly inside too although didn't speak English but that was fine. It was probably one of the most memorable experiences of the trip for all of us."

The staff were extremely unhelpful in trying to resolve this issue would not check their confirmation emails etc and end result was we had to queue up three times and buy tickets for a second time. On return home website links to the booking will not work so still can't prove that the booking was correct.

As I'm nearly 6'6\" (2 meters) tall, I find the seating to be very comfortable which is a rare occasion for me.Personally I recommend the Kirov Ballet. Of course the sets, lighting and music are awesome. Some of the performers are not simply supreme ballet dancers, they are really olympic quality athletes. The closest man will ever come to flying on his own happens on the stage of the Mariinsky theater. If it's your first visit, be sure to head to the top floor at intermission for champagne, ice cream (my favorite) and other Russian snacks."
