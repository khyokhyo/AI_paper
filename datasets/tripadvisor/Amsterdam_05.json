The music was fine (except the tenor who had just one volume, too loud and no acting qualities). Eva Maria Westbroek was great. But the staging was terrible. Please keep this German Regie Theater home in Germany. It spoiled my night at the opera"

It was totally captivating. The dancers and musicians were in total harmony. I greatly enjoyed. Did not see time passing by. Warmly recommended. Access is easy, by tram or by subway. Or on foot. Or by taxi, of course. As you like it."

We had a wonderful evening in the Dutch National Opera & Ballet theatre showing a post-modern version of the Nozze di Figaro by David B\u00f6sch. We much enjoyed the performance with funny scenes and funny 'finds', such as a ''selfie'' taken by the main players.Both the orchestra and the choir (of the National Opera) were great.For me the highlight was Marianne Crebassa in her role of Cherubino. She has a wonderful voice. My wife preferred Eleonora Bratto in her role of countess.I am not sure there are further performances in Amsterdam, but if there are I would highly recommend trying to get a ticket."

I waited in line in a queu to get tickets a couple of hours before the show and managed to snag a 15 euro student ticket (Even with the show is sold out they often have returned tickets so it's likely you could still buy one). The staff were extremely friendly and helpful in assisting me in purchasing my ticket. I was sitting in the 8th row in the center of the orchestra and the view was stupendous. The english translations/ subtitle screen could have been a bit better, but the cast and set were phenomenal. I would love to go back here!"

The National Opera and Ballet building is easily seen from several streets and not hard to get to although getting in the building was a bit confusing. We ended up following a lot of other people and eventually found the front and the entrance. A contemporary opera house, red velvet decor inside, it was comfortable and from our seats the action on the stage was easily visible. We were on the main floor, having paid quite a bit for our tickets. You should buy tickets well in advance of your desired visit, as opera does sell out in Europe, and this was no exception. I bought tickets about 2 months prior and had to get the 2nd most expensive seats to get in. It was worth it. This interpretation of Mozart's Don Giovanni was contemporary which isn't normally my favorite (I prefer traditional sets and costuming) but it was incredibly well done. The orchestra was outstanding, the soloists, the staging, everything about it was amazing. We attended a Sunday afternoon performance, then went wandering a bit as it stays light so late in the summer, and dined early somewhere else in the city. If you are an opera buff and the season is on while you are in Amsterdam, it's worth a few hours and some $$ to attend."

There are different opera and ballet productions, and you might prefer one production over another. But they are all good, and many are excellent.Yesterday I enjoyed Don Giovanni by Mozart and DaPonte. An interesting decor, a big rotating platform with large trees, where the different scenes took place. And with a lot more variety than you might imagine from my description of rotating woodland. All singers were good, the title role excellent. But I thought the three ladies (Donna Anna, Elvira and Zerlina) had great arias, as well as Leporello (\"Mille e tre!\"). I enjoyed many greag operas in the last ten years or more, so if you can go to an opera you never heard of. Try it!"

Even for the shows that they don't offer online tickets, you can show up an hour and a half before a performance and get un-sold tickets with a student id.

Perhaps, calling the Opera house \"cozy\" is unorthodox, yet this is how it feels to me--it makes me feel at home. Maybe because it's not as big as some other European Opera houses (or so it's seems like). I think that the Dutch creativity can certainly be seen in the choreography, costumes and the overall look & feel of the performances. There's only one thing that takes away from the experience--the way some visitors dress. It seems to me that the Dutch are not educated about the standard dress-code for visiting the Opera/Ballet. Many are dressed in sneakers, and some even wear sweatpants. Some look like they are out for the weekend in the woods. I think that the visit to a National Opera house is a comprehensive experience--it consists of so many tiny details, and dressing the part is one of them. To me at least, it's something special (and for whom is it not?), because it doesn't happen too often.

The dancing in general and the soloists in particular were excellent, Igone de Jongh was especially graceful and elegant as Mata Hari. The music can be both fun and bombastic as well as very uncomfortable. Interesting choices by the composer. The choreography was good, although the last pas de deux between Mata Hari and her husband was intense and vivid, an almost uncomfortable watch with the sheer power and violence being depicted on stage. The staging was done well, looking impressive and conveying a sense of constantly being on the move (which the different parts of the stage were).Costuming was, for me, the most arresting and brilliant thing of the performance. All the outfits were matched to the scene, the dancing and the dancers themselves. I was very impressed.The overall feel of Mata Hari is like watching a grandly produced musical. The acting in Mata Hari is more direct and visceral than you would normally see in a classical ballet performance. All in all, if you are not sure about ballet but love theater and musicals, this would probably suit you. If you are expecting to see a performance like Giselle or the Swan Lake, Mata Hari does not have that same painterly and abstract quality. The costuming and the dramatic acting and choreography are the standouts here."

I understand her life story and her challenges, but I paid good money to see good ballet and her dancing left me feeling cheated.On the contrary, Remi Wortmeyer was wonderful!! He is graceful, athletic and totally superior. Maybe it was his excellence that made Michaela look so dumpy and ungracious. The music was beautiful! The other dancers were spectacular .... it is a pity that the one Russian dancer lost her balance, but even that can be forgiven.... it happens. I think that if I had known that Michaela would be dancing Carla on Monday (28th), I would not have spent \u20ac400 on the tickets.

The name-giver of the programme is a reprise of a 1979 ballet of a dancer's pas-de deux (Igone de Jongh) with a cameraman (Marijn Rademaker) who follows her dancing -- even to outside of the theatre. What an innovative piece this was, all those years ago, breaking the constraints of stage-space, but also anticipating the notion of a narcissistic love of camera's.The music Van Manen chooses to inspire his choreographies ranges from high-classical (Liszt) to daringly experimental (Cage, ter Veldhuis).It is amazing how Van Manen has always explored new ideas, bored by the prospect of repeating himself.\"Live\" is a fantastic opportunity to see four of the master's creations in one programme!

I've called them to ask for an explanation and every time a different person answered, always blaming somebody else for the situation. To this day, still no refund and no explanation as to why their shop had access to my credit card! Then when we arrived at the venue we were stuck in a queue after some girls who were claiming to have bought tickets and could prove it through a confirmation email on their phone, but the ticket office had lost their reservation and lost lots of time looking for it. People working at the overpriced cafe seemed like they were doing so for the first time in their lives. Very slow and confused. The first part of the ballet (Emeralds) was definitely bad and boring. We were not impressed by the performance of the cast. Luckily the two parts that followed (Rubies and Diamonds) were fantastic and saved the night. Altogether disappointing, we'll definitely think twice before coming back."

Upstairs in the theatre, just outside the entrances to the seats, are bars and counters serving drinks that can be pre-ordered and are waiting for you during the intermissions."

If you are visiting Amsterdam for a few days, and are an opera or ballet fan, do not miss \u00b4Het Muziektheater\u00b4 - The Music Theatre. The productions are very good and something you will not have seen elsewhere. It is a new building overseeing the river Amstel, so you can admire the night view of the canals during the break. (Not everyone will agree with choices of interior design, but this is Holland). The organisation is superb, see the web site for details."

The Muziektheater is an impressive building and one of it's habitants, The National Ballet, is a world renown ensemble. If you have a chance when you're in town to visit one of their performances, don't hesitate. And don't let your evening be spoiled by the awful pinkish salmon like carpet which should be ritually burned a.s.a.p."

I was visiting Amsterdam by myself for a few days and thought a trip to see the National Ballet Company perform at the Amsterdam Music Theatre (Stopera) would be a good way to while away an evening. I'm so glad I went - I've seen Swan Lake a couple of times before but this production was in another league. The music and dancing were excellent and even though the show was three-and-a-half hours long I could have watched more! The auditorium is lovely and huge, with seats for 1,600 people - and almost every seat was full. It's not cheap (43 euros) but it was well worth it and I would definitely watch another show if I visit Amsterdam again."
