We spend 4 hours there to discover Tokyo's history. Cheap ticket is only 600yen/adult. Free for kids. Restaurant is inside with japanese foods such as udon noodle. Quite delicious although expensive. A must-see museum when visiting Tokyo."

We had a free tour from a very nice English speaking volunteer, Kunio Sanui, who put us through our paces for 3 hours. He was 75 years old and we could barely keep up with him. The museum is accessible on your own due to the English signage. But having Sanui gave us the opportunity to ask many questions that he not only answered but elaborated on. What was a one-hour tour became three hours! His love of his city made everything come alive. Afterwards, there was still more that Sanui didn't have time to show us but that we had to see, i.e. WWII."

This is a stunning museum that provides an excellent record of the history of the transition from when the city, previously known as Edo, became Tokyo, as well as some more recent historic displays. It is an extensive display, and an excellent free guide service is available in English to take you through it. Our guide was a well educated Japanese who, at 87 years of age, was impressively sprightly and very well informed on his topic. You need to allow at least three hours to do the Edo-Tokyo subject, and this will just be a basic introduction to this interesting topic."

There are many museums in Tokyo however the Edo Museum provides a superb overview of how people live in Tokyo...their homes, technology and culture. I am not a great fan of Museums showing small trinkets and ancient fabrics. Edo has examples of housing, cars, mobile phones etc. The building is superb from an engineering perspective."

You can go to Akihabara Station on the Yamanote Line and change to the subway. The museum is a short walk from Ryogoku Sation. Please note that the museum is closed on Mondays. If you qualify, there's a senior rate. Anyway, tickets are reasonable. The gift shops have nice quality merchandise."

They have studied and know their information very well. I had an English-speaking guide at this museum. Even though there is English signage throughout the museum, she told me things that weren't on the display materials. More than half of the museum is devoted to the lifestyle of people during the Edo period of Japanese history (1600-1868). The rest is about modern Tokyo, from about 1920 to now. There are artifacts, of course. There are life-sized examples of houses from the Edo period and exhibits on culture, business, urbanization, the war, and Tokyo in the 21st century. There are many dioramas of the castle and the city as it developed. One of the best dioramas showed Western style fronts of buildings around the time the Edo period ended and Japan opened to trade with the West, and behind the fancy facades the local people still lived in houses that were the same as a hundred years earlier. The museum style is new and varied. I was with the guide for almost three hours and then went back and quickly took a few more photos."

This is a very spacious museum, though the approach and entrance seem quite dark and it felt more like going to a big US library or government building.Once inside there are some great miniature models of old Tokyo and life-size replica houses from lots of different eras. I loved the display of old books and the twentieth century buildings and exhibitions. There is information in English as well. I'd have liked there to have been more/ better cafes and it did feel a bit like it was off-peak season, but it was worth the trip. Fun seeing real Sumo wrestlers outside the station too!"

            "review": "Great city museum experience. A brilliantly designed exhibition, the Edo-Tokyo Museum provides a comprehensive and fascinating journey through Tokyo's environs beginning when the city was founded in the 12th century, right up to the early twentieth century. Hands-on exhibits like the 'honey-buckets' and various tools give the visitor a good visceral sense of what life was like in the 'old days' while a walk-in model of an early 1950s home gives a great sense of what has recently passed. The different periods are portrayed by models of cities, artefacts and explanatory texts in Japanese and English. Particularly moving was the exhibit dealing with the fire-bombing of Tokyo toward the end of World War 2. A combination of war relics, including unexploded bombs, weapons and other relics of the destruction, with multi-media (light-up maps, video and radio from the time) was truly immersive and saddening. But Tokyo has a rich history and culture beyond war and a life which is very humane and cultured, witness the small cars from the early 1960s and parents and children can enjoy the exhibit of school lunches from the 1970s to the present.The Edo-Tokyo Museum is a wonderful place to get to know Tokyo's story, and worth devoting the best part of a day to thoroughly explore and learn."

Although called Edo museum, it also has the modern Tokyo history on display. You get a very good insight to the history and culture of Tokyo and Japan. I even saw a copy of the of the letter of surrender from World War II. All display were well explained in English text and there were many interactive things for both adults and kids. The souvenir shops at this Museum were really good too, make sure you spend some time there. We spent a good 3-4 hours at this museum and think this should be on everyone's must do list for Tokyo."

The Edo culture is the core of current Japanese culture - Kabuki, Ukiyo-e, Sumo, Oiran - you will stand in the restored Edo city at its full-bloom. The museum also shows the transition from the time of samurai and ever growing people (Edo period) to democratic Japan (Meiji, Showa). You could also spend hours in the museum shop filled with collections of Japanese traditional accessories, cloths, gadgets. Take a break at chic Japanese restaurant and cafe with traditional interior. I particularly loved cafe \"Sarara\" for afternoon sweets and tea."

Beautiful 360 degree exhibits in meticulous detail, showing the history of the Edo period in Japan. There are cutaway models of a theatre, houses of the rich, poor and artisan craftsmen and dioramas showing how the town would have looked. On the other side of the building is the story of 20th century Japan again featuring cut -away houses and all the artifacts. All in all it's a fascinating insight into Japanese history and really brings it to life. Recommended."

Went with a friend who lived in Tokyo as a child but who hadn't been back in a while and we all found the museum an insightful and enlightening visit. We didn't see the special exhibition and stuck to the permanent collection and we had a light meal in the upstairs restaurant. Nice views of the city from up there. The first floor restaurant has only tea/coffee and sweets, but the upstairs one has a full menu including noodles, set meals, etc. Good for a half-day visit easily accessibly by train (like almost everything in Tokyo). The Senso-ji Temple complex is only one or two train stops away and could be easily combined on the same day, as well as the Sumo trophy museum right next door."

Model and miniature scale facilities (from those used by commoners to the Shogun and the Emperor) are all meticulously presented with great detail. Interactive exhibits provide good relief from just the visual senses being stimulated. We arrived to find no free volunteer English guide, so set out by ourselves to read the plentiful English descriptions for all the exhibits ... But we decided after about 10-15 minutes that we'd go and rent some audio - the exhibits' plaques are detailed and contain many Japanese place names that can make you lose focus on what you are reading about (as one seeks to pronounce the multi-syllabic place names correctly !). Upon returning to the front desk, we found an English speaking guide had just finished an earlier tour ! And what a treasure he was. Far better experience to have someone whisk you through (1.5 hours) and tell the key stories and share the important information you need to know (and then you just toddle back through at your own pace to fill in any gaps, or take a second look, take photos). Highly recommend this museum - the 2-3 hours will fly by, especially if you get yourself a free guide."

Very dramatic when we walked in.The history of Japan was presented in the most visual ways. Displays ran from detailed, small-scale replicas of an Edo village (home of the shogun) all the way to a full-sized Japanese farm house from the 1930s where we could walk into the rooms. Many hands-on opportunities. And a gigantic full-sized bridge that replicated one from the Edo village display was amazing and gave us a sense of walking through history. The information about the fire-bombing of Tokyo and the horrible conditions for those Japanese who survived the war was disturbing, but important to learn about.Overall, the place was fun and kept our attention till the end, unlike many static displays found in more traditional museums. We learned so much and enjoyed every minute.Afterward, we went to the museum cafe on the first floor and had ice cream, cold tea, and some traditional Japanese desserts that were really gooey. We didn't like them much, but hey, at least we tried them."

Really, really impressed by the greatly detailed miniature models of Edo city (as Tokyo was known back then in the Tokugawa period) on the 7th floor (the highest floor) - main streets with people walking along, bridges & boats, a daimyo's house with a big courtyard, a castle & its nearby city all surrounded by a moat, etc.; and on the 6th floor are \"life-sized models\" of a theater house with life-sized performers on a stage, a two-story Victorian-styled house which is also pretty much life-sized (imagine a real two-story Victorian house inside a museum!) and houses of ordinary people (saw life-sized figures of a woman giving birth with some people around her in one of them), and also to be seen on the 6th floor is a nice sculpture of the first Tokugawa shogun.They close at 5 30 pm, and I suggest to do this museum starting from the top (the 7th floor where those amazing Edo City miniatures are) and making your way down; I personally got to do only 7th & 6th floors since I got there only at 4 pm, so yes be mindful of the 5 30 closing time and start from the top because that's where the best things to see are (the Edo City miniatures).I walked about half an hour from the Asakusa area by crossing the Sumida River from its west side (the Museum is on the east side) and going south. But there's Ryogoku Station (Toei Oedo Line) pretty much like right beside the Museum, and there's also a McDonald's nearby where I had my dinner of burgers."

Exhibition is organized on two floors, with great examples of architecture and cultural objects. Well described in English, offers private, free of charge guided tours in several languages. Surprisingly, it takes about three hours to walk through and read all the materials. Gives a good grasp of what Tokio development looked like. Worth a try."

This is a perfect place to stay with a family or to understand what Tokyo use to be and how it is now .The permanent exhibition at the museum is well design and a good introduction to Japanese culture through time. I actually spend more then 2 hours and I managed to see all of it . I think I have almost 100 over pictures if you are interested in the Edo period like me you will love it . The whole place is giant space with reconstructed bridges, houses, and other structures from the Edo era, as well as miniatures and artifacts. It's interesting to see how people lived those days . It's really mysterious the era ... I was like a child excited , curious , confused and mystified with this amazing museum and just wanted to see , know and understand everything : Please do visit if you have the opportunity but make sure you have patience and the time ...:Cheers"

As you move from one section to the next, you feel as if you are also moving through the years as Edo the small village is evolving to become bigger and bigger into modern Tokyo.The transformation of culture and way of life provides a quick and interesting history lesson. After 2-3 hours of browsing and looking at dioramas, artifacts, exhibits, and reconstructed models, you are back in present day Tokyo. This time with a clearer understanding of how Tokyo life came to be. Japanese culture is indeed rich and unique. This short visit will surely enrich your knowledge."

My first visit (in 2014) was arranged through the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Visitor Center that provided two very knowledgeable guides who pointed out many high points that I would have missed without a guided tour. In my second visit (in 2016), I took a family member and we spent more time seeing what we wanted to see in more detail. Signs are very good in English (and of course Japanese). With the right camera, good pictures can be taken without flash in most areas. The museum is divided into two parts: the Edo Period prior to 1868 and western influence, and the Tokyo Period after 1868, which shows architectural changes and other inventions. Selection of items is outstanding, and whether a long or short period of time is spent in the museum, you will learn a great deal about the history of Japan in all of its phases. There are also activities for children."

The permanent exhibition was already worth it, and you can take as many photos that you like to remember the occasion. If you're a tourist I suggest you get an English speaking tour guide which is free, because they can explain a lot of interesting facts and give you access to places - like playing with old style instruments for sound effects in kabuki theater which was so cool. We were fortunate enough to also catch the Yokai exhibition which was also fascinating, creepy and sometimes humorous. It's an awesome place ! Worth every yen :)"

While it's understandable that this museum might not be on most folks' list of what to see on a first trip to Tokyo, I would rate this museum as one of Tokyo's best attractions. As it's name suggests, the focus is on the city of Tokyo and its predecessor, Edo. There's plenty to cover in the permanent exhibition with fascinating examinations of Edo Castle and its environs, the lives, activities, celebrations and tribulations of Tokyo's citizens, as well as the events that marked the transition from old Edo to modern Tokyo, Exhibits had good explanations in both Japanese and English. A quick 1-to 2-hour visit would be fine if time is a premium but to really do it justice, at least 3 hours is needed. Much as the permanent exhibitions can be very engaging, don't forget to check out some of the temporary and/or special exhibitions. While an additional admission fee may be charged for some of them, the themes can be very fascinating and complement well the permanent exhibits. On a previous trip, I managed to catch a fabulous display of ukiyo-e prints of Hiroshige's 53 stations of the Tokaido Road. At the same time, there was a special exhibition which resonated strongly with local visitors featured the history of the Battle of Sekigawara.Some tips which might be useful: Firstly, try to avoid weekends as the crowds can be incredible. I once visited on a Sunday, and while the queues to purchase admission tickets moved fairly quickly, they did snake all around the ground floor of the museum. And secondly. while there are three restaurants/cafes in the museum, more economical options for meals may be found at the many restaurants located under the train tracks on the south side of Ryokogu station (located right next to the museum)."

Whenever my friends and family visit me in Tokyo, we make sure to visit this museum. It's a great place where you can learn the history of what is now the city of Tokyo. I've done about 1.5-2hour tours with volunteer guides and we never have enough time to see and learn about all of the exhibits. Some of the best points of this museum are :-- very reasonably priced at 600yen-- there are volunteer guides (Japanese, English, Chinese, Korean, French, German and Spanish) who provide you with a wealth of information. In order to reserve a guide, make sure you get to the museum between 10am and 3pm. -- permanent exhibits are visually stunning. There are handmade and crafted figurines throughout the museum. Each of these according to our guide costs between 100 to 1,000 USD! Don't forget to use the provided binoculars to check out the figurines closer. You'll be astonished to see that each one has unique clothing and facial expressions.-- The museum is located in Ryogkoku. This is the area which is associated with the traditional Japanese sport -- Sumo. Even though you might not have a chance to attend a sumo match as they are only held 3 times a year in Tokyo ...and the tickets are expensive and hard to get! You will be able to enjoy traditional sumo wrestler's dish while you are in Ryogkoku -- Chanko Nabe a hot pot dish full of yummy surprises! Looks and sounds quite peculiar, but it tastes great!. Especially recommend for the cold winter season. This museum is one of my favourite sightseeing attractions in Tokyo. Give it a go!"

Japan has such a long and interesting history that this place is a great day trip. Even with a little kid (6) he was still interested in all the different models and recreations. Who doesn't like miniaturized figures??? It also happened to be raining that day we planned to go so we were glad for an indoor activity.Granted because this is Japan, there is mostly Japanese signs but you can take an audio tour in your language. We opted to pass on this since we weren't sure how long our son would let us linger and read each display. There was just enough English in all the places we read that we still learned a great deal here. Surprisingly he was pretty interested in 85% of what we saw. There are all sorts of displays to see and the different areas offered a good mix of replicas to help you visualize what older Japan was like. My son especially liked all the old models of bikes and carriages of transport that you could try and take pictures in. There are models and replicas of everything and anything...from actual buildings and houses-to different artifacts. Everything was done well and the layout was easy and not confusing. There was so much history to soak in that I wish I could have stayed longer!"

The displays are really wonderful and give a great sense of the \"old\" Tokyo - Edo town as well as the history and transition to more modern Tokyo. The museum offered a free (yes - free) English-speaking guide who was extremely knowledgeable about the history of Tokyo and that really added to the trip. You just have to ask for a guide when you reach the entrance on floor 6 (where the exhibits start). The exhibits include a full-sized kabuki theater and many detailed dioramas that give you a real feel for life back in those times. I would definitely put this on your list. It is very easily reached by the subway (Ryogoku stop on the Toei-Oedo Line). Kids would have a great time here as a number of the exhibits allow you to touch and try different types of objects, tools, etc."

There was supposed to be english-speaking guides at the museum, but when we arrived they were all occupied, there was also supposed to be audio-guides which we didnt realize til later, cause the man at the ticketcounter failed to inform us about this.As far as the exhibition goes, there seemed to be no logical explanation to the order in which you were supposed to walk through. It seemed to be just a bunch of random items displayed that absolutely failed to catch my interest. It also wasnt clear If any of the items whatsoever were original items? It was as If they focused on the most boring parts of tokyo history! (which i think probably is a lot more exciting, depending on how you present it)I have visited far better museums depicting the historys of major cities than this. This museum felt dated, unrealistic, non english friendly and boring. They should really take notes from other countries that have more modern city-museums.On the plus side: Close to public transportation and reasonably priced admission cost."

Yes, there are models of houses, theaters and bridges, but the whole display fails to convey a picture of what the Edo period was like. There is as much reality in it as in a model train set. The museum building itself is downright ugly, but the inside does not make up for it with a poorly designed layout. Even the lobby is just confusing. Or are there two lobbies, maybe? And how to you get to the exposition? Well, follow the crowd. And, apart from models, the entire museum seems empty, with some scattered displays of random things. Tokyo is a world class city with a city museum fit for a small town. This is not a museum, this is a theme park gone wrong."

There are many different types of displays here- this museum really appeals to everyone and all placards are written in both Japanese and English, which is a plus.

Furthermore, knowing that the permanent exhibit is located on the 6th floor made me feel less excited. But upon entering the museum from the 3rd floor, I started to become impressed. For some reason, I liked the chronological pictures on the walls of the escalator.My impression just got better once I entered the main exhibit. I thought the life-size model of Nihonbashi Bridge was just stunning. The small replicas of the old Edo towns were also quite impressive. I thought that these would just awe children but I was wrong. The artists behind these displays did a very good job depicting old Tokyo.The other exhibits were also worth seeing. I particularly liked the way they put things in chronological order, which clearly showed how Japanese fashion, architecture, and their way of life changed from pre-war to post-war times. - Highly recommended for families. - Better add a visit to the Sumo Stadium, especially if there's a match. - If interested and willing, a chanko nabe for lunch would add to the experience."

The entry fee to the museum was nominal; I just paid for the permanent exhibits, not for any of the temporary ones. I also recommend hitting the gift shop at the entrance FIRST, since it's possible you'll leave from another exit. The gift shop is great and has some unique gifts if you're looking for that sort of thing.The staff will escort you to the top floor, where you're to start your tour, by guiding you to the escalator. Once you're on the top floor, it's amazing, and let the fun begin! There's plenty of hands-on activities; amazingly detailed models, and entirely relocated buildings.

Many displays are hands on like riding in a rickshaw and carriage or living in a traditional Japanese home. I think the museum is very complete in touching on so many sub-topics of the Edo period. The exhibit halls are spacious and open. Very comfortable even when busy.There was also a life show in the performance stage area. Very entertaining.

You see Tokyo then known as Edo being founded by the Tokugawa family. You will see their opulence through the model of the Edo Castle and various houses of Lords. You will encounter many Tokugawa Edo era paraphernalias. You will have a glimpse of the daily lives of the people of old Edo. After visiting the model of Kabuki Theater and its life sized mannequins, you will be transported into modern Tokyo. You will see Edo as it evolves into Tokyo. Western influences start to permeate Tokyo through the western dioramas and old Ginza. You will see development of the clothes of the people, heritage houses, life in war times, toys, games, fashion trends in the modern era ending by visiting another simple Japanese house. Great museum, too much to see, you should alot 2 to 3 hours at least to see everything. You can find time to relax on the third floor balcony just after you descended from the museum for fresh air. Gift shops can be found ground floor. Surely a great alternative to the TNM in Ueno Park."

The services include free volunteer tour guides in different languages. Edo museum has alot of interesting facts explaining everything related to Edo life, including social ranks, royal residences, living quarters of common people, occupations, art, entertainment, disasters, fire fighting, water way systems, etc... It is very informative, but more fun than a typical museum. You can walk up close or into replicas of the living quarters, pick up the box of silver coins that the merchants carried, get into the palanquin and pose for a picture, and learn what's behind the stage of a Kabuki theater. Even if you are not typically a museum kind of person I think you will still enjoy Edo museum."

Despite being tired and a little hungry, it kept our children well amused and interested for a good few hours.

The museum talks about the Edo period up to the modern Tokyo and is very lively because it has some big architectural remakes almost live size and the whole space has a good, open atmosphere. You can almost take photos of everything, some even with flash, but be aware than some side exhibits have special non-photo rules. This is easily a 3 hours stop.

Some of the models are scale models, but others are life size, such as the frontage of a Kabuki Theatre. All the exhibits are clearly described with detailed captions in Japanese and English, as well as six other languages (French, German, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Korean) giving the same information via a computer screen.In addition to the models, there is a wealth of information on the Edo period in the various displays around the walls of the museum.

This museum is actually bigger than what I first thought and my only issue is that I did not take time to read all the information available.More out of laziness than anything else (it was the last museum visit of our Japan trip). It displays all you might want to know about Tokyo, its past, and its organization. Whether it concerns politics, business, arts, or daily life, everything is explained there. My favourite part is the one showing how drawings were printed (one wooden block for each colour)! Everything is presented in a fun way so children can enjoy the visit as well. There are some activities in the museum and seats if visitors want to have a break. There is also a nice shop with cards, jewelry, decorative items and various accessories. Good place to visit if you are in Tokyo!"

There are also more standard museum-type exhibits - old scrolls and documents, old clothes, etc. Some displays are interactive, meaning it's good for kids or for those of us who don't like just reading info. I rather liked the old radio that was programmed to play specific radio clips from pre-war/wartime Japan. Many of the displays had English descriptions, which was also useful."

The Edo Museum is too huge and trying hard to be modern, innovative and clever that it sort of ruins the message of history and tradition that they are trying to convey. The small and intimate version of the Shitamachi museum is much more effective in its retelling of the story of Tokyo in the Edo period. In the Edo Museum, the dioramas of Edo/Tokyo street scenes are impressive both in terms of scale and detail, but too huge to be appreciated fully (you literally need the binoculars provided to see individual figures! That is, if you can get hold of one amongst the crowd around the edges). The displays were hard to interpret and the lighting made it difficult to take photographs. It was nice to see a reconstruction of the Edo Castle in relation to the surrounding streetscape and we really wanted to relate what we saw of the remnants of the Imperial Castle compound earlier to the diorama of the same area, but it was so difficult to make sense! All the historical information on the wall displays would have been interesting if only there were more details in English - only the very basic information is translated and seems pitched to school children. The Edo period is very interesting but we were left wanting to know more. The building replicas also looked just too clean, too crisp, too new. This is a museum for locals with local details in a spacious modern style. I am so pleased we went to the Shitamachi museum first. I will certainly go back to the Shitamachi in Ueno - the Edo Museum may be worth a visit if you are in the Ryoguko area for the sumo wrestling or if it is raining."

That is not to say the English explanation which is on just about every display is sufficient but I just like fun facts. There are also plenty of interactive displays so you can experience what people needed to carry on their day to day lives. The translating guides are fully volunteer guides which are available from 1100 - 1500 so they're not always going to be available right away or outside those hours. And at 1500 that is when the guide ends so if you need a guide arrive early."

The models of the early city are incredibly well-done. The staff are friendly, you might be able to catch a free tour guide in your language (eg. English) at the start of your visit. To cap things off, the gift store is a great place to get souvenirs, particularly Japanese towels and handkerchiefs, at a good price. We ate at the Italian restaurant on museum grounds.

I believe the Di Vinci exhibit lasts until April 2016. It is worth the time and money to visit this exhibit. Overall impressions of the permanent exhibit:Child #1 \"I enjoyed the interactive parts of the museum and the models\". This museum has a number of exhibits that kids (and adults) can climb into, pick up and touch. Wear clean socks- shoes have to be removed at various hands on portions. Child #2 \"I enjoyed climbing on the big bicycles and rickshaws.\" He was also shocked to see the model homes that lacked a television. He also spent a great deal of time learning about the Tokyo air raids. There is a great deal of English, explaining about the exhibits!

On the side, the sumo stadium is next to the museum. So if the season is correct, maybe you want to visit the stadium to watch the sumo matches. But tickets go fast. Get in online in advance and if not, 350 tickets will be sold in the morning at the door. Unless you go really early, otherwise you might not be able to get one (just like me this morning).

We had a visit to the Edo Tokyo Museum on our list as a must see - reviews had shown it was a great insight into Tokyo of the past - but unfortunately it was closed when we went apparently due to a holiday? I still don't understand why the premiere museum in Tokyo would be closed in the prime tourist season - strange but unfortunately true. What could be seen from outside indicated a vast collection that no doubt would have enhanced our visit to Tokyo. Very easy to get to as a train station is located almost next door. This museum is also situated right next door to the Sumo Museum so it could very easily be combined in a visit at the same time.I will definitely make the effort to get inside on my next trip."

I think it costs about $1,500 yen if you want to see both. The permanent exhibit is pretty large and interesting, though, and if you like to read everything and take pictures like I do, you will need at least three hours for that part alone. My brother skipped through a lot of the reading and only took a couple of pictures, and finished in about 90 minutes. You will probably need 5 hours to do both exhibits--or go on two separate days. I didn't have the chance to do it, but the Ukiyoe exhibit looked like it would have been really nice to see! Anyway, the permanent exhibit is cool because they have scaled models of what different parts of Tokyo looked like during different time periods, as well as lots of art, and full sized models of houses and everyday items that people used from 1600s right up through the 1950s. You can even take pictures of yourself inside of a palanquin, a rickshaw, and a giant 1920s (?) bicycle, or carrying fish baskets on a pole over your shoulders. My brother typically hates to go to museums with me, but he enjoyed this one!"

The best bit for me are the life sized replica houses for the Edo period, as well as miniature models of Edo and Tokyo that come to life every 15 minutes or so (with a guide who'd give an introduction of the models in Japanese). The detail they put into creating these models simply amazing. Not too many English explanations for the exhibits but I think it's enough to get by if you can rent an audio-guide.

I learnt a few things!Some exhibits are hands on. Great for the kids.I especially enjoyed the display around 1920's Tokyo. Definitely go if museums are your thing or if your after something different from the standard museum experience."

This is the first time for me to visit here even living in Tokyo, but it is so fantastic to learn how Edo Period looks like and Tokyo has been established. There are both Permanent Exhibition and Special Exhibition area. For foreign visitors volunteer guides are available as for the permanent exhibition area. Permanent exhibition: Edo Castle, Life and town peoples, Four seasons entertainment, how villages and island linked with Edo(merchants and stations) , aesthetics of Edo (Kabuki), Kabuki Theaters and pleasure of Edo period. Tokyo: how Tokyo urban culture established. When I visited, special exhibition: \"Ukiyo-e to photography\" Cultural Awakening in Japan's Visual Field; Ukiyo-e, which features famous places of Edo, which continued to increase as the city developed, and the popular beauties and celebrities of the time, who were singled out from the crowds that populated genre paintings to be depicted independently. Picture and Photograph, Nishiki-e, Mud pictures, Glass pictures and oil pictures has been developed after Meiji Period civilization. It is wonderful to learn about our own culture."

Just behind the Sumo Stadium and with easy transport connections the Edo Museum is a great place to get a handle on the history of T\u014dky\u014d when it was known as Edo. There are some great reconstructions and miniature replicas of some of the older buildings in Edo which no longer exist, Edo Castle, a Samurai Lord's Edo residence, the old Nakamuraza Kabuki Theatre to name a few. The exhibits cover Edo generally whilst there are usually special exhibitions on which give a glimpse into some of the more niche elements of Edo era life - an exhibition of Tokugawa castles was on this September. Admission to both the general exhibition area and the special exhibitions can be bought on a dual admission ticket. There are tours run by English speaking volunteers (as well as tours run in other languages). There are also a few cafes and restaurants for a convenient meal. The museum shop sells some very nice souvenirs."

I was interested in a small section towards the bar which highlights the end of WW2 and all the allied firebombing of Tokyo . Seemed to me that although it would have been over a few months of bombing, there was probably more loss of life than the A bombing of Hiroshima!Also some 60's electronic appliances and even an Atari console interested me as well as info on the '64 Olympics. A lot of effort has been put into the museum and the facility including the lockers are superb but something didn't quite make it a \"must see\" for me.

The museum has some artifacts (paintings, ceramics, sculptures, clothes, armors, swords etc.) on display, but they do not come close to what the Tokyo National Museum offers.Long story short: This museum gives a good feel for what life was in historic Tokyo. It is more of a family oriented museum and many displays can be touched. It complements well with the Tokyo National Museum. I would give it 1-2 hours."

Once you get off the 6th floor, you understand why the tour starts on the 6th floor. You cross a wooden bridge as you would in the Edo period. The bridge and the 6th floor overlook reproductions of a building from the Edo period on one side, and a more recent building on the other. The entry to the permanent exhibit is very unique. On this floor are elaborate scale models of villages from the Edo period. It was very unique. Downstairs you can get close up to the reproductions and there are other exhibits.

As a history teacher, my husband appreciated being able to read about World World II from the perspective of the Japanese and gleaned a lot of knowledge he will be taking back with him to his history class. I enjoyed learning about how the history of Tokyo shaped many practices see in present day Tokyo, such as wrapping books. It's always fun to see where cultural practices come from and to begin to understand the meaning behind them. If you're a lover of history, museums, or being able to learn hands on, this is a great place to visit while in Tokyo.Practical Info: There are many bathrooms throughout and even free English tours given at certain times."

Inside you cross a replica of the Sumida bridge to get to see large scale models of the Imperial palace in the 1600's and as you follow the tour around past large replicas of a Kabuki Theatre and other buildings, past the swords and clothing from the 1600's to the air raid shelters of WW2......Its a facinating glimpse into Japanese History and a good place to start if you want to understand more about Japan.They have English speaking volunteer guides which i followed and can recommend this."

The Meiji period you have to do it by yourself but it is not long. We were surprised by hearing that a lot of the museum belongings are replicas and not the originals. And Overall the museum is interesting and nice, worth visiting if you are interested in the history of the Edo period and the development of Tokyo mostly."

However, the Edo-Tokyo Museum is well laid-out and interesting, featuring many hands-on and large-scale models and other 3D exhibits. The museum provides an excellent insight into the Edo period and the development of Japan itself, and its Westernisation. It is well worth visiting before you embark on a wider tour of the country. The museum includes various facilities, including lockers and a very popular restaurant that serves modern takes on Edo-period recipes. This is located on the 7th floor, from where there are good views over the city. No English was spoken in the restaurant, although it is easy to get by as there is a menu in English with pictures illustrating the various dishes available. I was at the museum for just over one-and-a-half hours, but could easily have stayed longer had my limited time in Tokyo permitted."

You can follow the details of life in almost every aspect, including what the money was like and how water was supplied to the city. Then they go into the history of Tokyo as Tokyo. There are special exhibitions too, but I found that 3-4 hours for just the permanent collection. This is also a great choice for a rainy day, as it's easy to get to by the Oedo subway line to the Ryogoku stop and there is so much to see.The English language audio guide is free, although you have to leave a 1000 Yen deposit - you get it back when you return the guide. The only problem I had with it was the person reading the copy. She spoke so deliberately - I suppose in an attempt to be understood by those for whom English is the only language that they know in which they could get the guide - that she actually mis-pronounced words. It made the narration very stilted and a bit hard to listen to. Perhaps they should have two versions of the English guide. One for native speakers and one for non-native speakers."

I didn't engage one of the free guides but was able later on to ask a few specific questions that arose in my mind as I looked around the excellent exhibition. However, in the main, I found there was enough of an explanation in English for me to understand what was being shown. I really enjoyed the small scale street scenes - pick up the binoculars and marvel in the detail shown on the model's kimonos or faces. There's also life size models and interactive pieces that bring life in the Edo period to life. I would have liked to learn more about the 1923 earthquake and bombing from WW2 but there are other museums that cover these in more detail. A bento box lunch on L7 was excellent - they range from 1600-2400YenYou could time your trip here to coincide with a boat trip back down the river to somewhere like the Hamarikyu Gardens near the Fish Market but the boats don't run all that frequently so you'll need to plan ahead."

She was a volunteer there and was very knowledgeable about everything.The remodeled 5-6 floors were very nice. They are designed as a walk-in exhibition where you can see life-sized models of townhouses and people who lived in them. It felt as if we time-traveled into the Edo period and the early days of Tokyo. On 5th floor, there is a huge theatre stage where concerts featuring traditional instruments and kabuki plays are performed.If you are in Ryogoku, you should stop by here and tuck some chanko-nabe hotpot in on the way home!"

This museum is not really for everyone - people looking for a general art museum like the National Museum (which was honestly very disappointing) will not care for it, but if you are like me and love models and displays that give you a real feel for what Tokyo (Edo) was like through history, you will find this museum very interesting. There are numerous miniature, intricate models depicting daily life in Edo, as well as plenty of life-sized models of everything from a Kabuki theater to traditional artist's house. I was just impressed by the level of the detail in the miniature displays on even the kimonos of small figures. This is a pretty cool place pretty close by areas like Ginza and Tsukiji, so I would budget a few hours for it."

This museum is nothing like a stuffy history museum . . .there are so many exhibits and the best part is that you can 'play' and interact with loads of them so you really feel as though you are learning a lot as well as having fun.The museum takes you on an amazing journey through Japan's history right through to modern day. We didn't use a tour guide, but did use a leaflet to show us the correct way to go round the museum and we didn't have any problems.The museum is huge and it took us a good couple of hours to make our way round. This is the perfect place to go on a rainy afternoon . . . and I learnt so much more about Japan. Very recommended . . . . . ."

We were extremely lucky to tag along with one of their excellent English speaking tour guides. Seiichi Inoue is one of their volunteer tour guide and as well as being very knowledgable is a really fun person to be around. Having visited the museum and had such a wonderful guide has taken my appreciation where Tokyo is today to another level.Forget the Disneylands, go to the Edo-Tokyo Museum."

Most of the exhibit was in Japanese, with some English translation but overall it was fascinating and worth the extra price. Of course the time ti took to go through this exhibit and a little time in the miniature area, most used up young boy museum patience, so we only managed to get through part of the remaining exhibit.

On trips we've taken to other cities/countries we spent a lot of time in museums. Sometimes all day. But for some reason I just wasn't feeling the Edo Museum. There were certainly some interesting things to look at and we learned about the history of the city and what life was like for residents of various classes. But when I think back on the highlights and larger displays in the museum, most of them we're replicas or models. There are large scale reproductions of a typical Edo period home, a Kabuki theater, and the Nihonbashi Bridge. There are dioramas portraying the layout of the Imperial Palace complex and residences of Edo's elite class. All of those things were well done and had sufficient English descriptions. But I don't recall seeing anything in the museum that really piqued my interest. We paid extra to visit the special exhibit detailing the Sekigahara battle led by Tokugawa Ieyasu. There were a lot of official documents and letters without any translations that we just skipped over. But there were some great swords and suits of battle armor, actually used and worn in the battle hundreds of years ago. I guess those are the types of artifacts that I would have enjoyed seeing more of in the rest of the museum. Overall it was a good museum, but for most of our time there I was looking forward to getting back out into the city."

The modern-day Tokyo side showed a timeline on the development of Japan ranging from houses to appliances to meals and education.A must-visit destination if you want to fully learn about Tokyo and the Japanese people."

Honestly, you could see everything here in under an hour. This place just screams to use more of the space to show what Japanese gardens looked like, fishing village recreations, what a Samurai holding looked like, you name it.

You look down onto the next floor which is concerned with the way ordinary folk lived and you can see a variety of reconstructed houses.The children seemed to be enjoying sitting in the sedans, riding penny farthing bicycles and so on but I did not think it a particularly child-friendly museum - considering the upgrade they could have done more. There is a stage so I assume there are performances during the day.As it only re-opened over Easter it is currently very busy - we had to queue for 20 minutes to get tickets.

The permanent exhibitions were reasonable - there were some good replicas of older styles of living in the Edo period.

I was originally going to the SKYTREE but as the weather and visibility was bad I changed my plans and went to the 'Edo-Tokyo Museum' and I am so glad I did as I learnt much of the Edo period and the history and culture of Japan and its Capital City.The Permanent Exhibitions on upper floors of the Museum are closed at the moment (scheduled to re-open on 28th March 2015) so there is currently a special temporary exhibition on called \"Explore! Experience! Edo-Tokyo\" which is on the First Floor. The exhibition is not that large but is does give a nice introduction to the history and culture of the Edo era and the changes that Tokyo has seen over the centuries. There are some lovely things to see, including all sorts of artefacts from across the different periods in Edo-Tokyo's history and evolution. I particularly liked the Japanese woodblock printing exhibits and bought some nice postcards of images from Hiroshige's One Hundred Famous Views of Edo prints.The best way to get to the Museum is to take the Subway using the Oedo Line to Ryogoku Station (E12). Museum entrance cost was just JPY300 (about GB\u00a31.75) and so it's amazing value and well worth a visit, especially on a wet cold day like the day I visited!!! I had a light lunch at \"Finn's Caf\u00e9\" at the Museum which was nice enough and also if in the area it is worth walking for 5 minutes over to the 'Sumo Museum at the Ryogoku Kokugikan' where the grand Sumo tournaments are held."

This made it friendly for kids and also engaged a lot of adults (myself included).There were good English language written materials and free audio guides but what really made it for me was our guide volunteer. She was knowledgeable, funny, and extremely nice! To give you an idea of the experience she brought to visit - she learned her excellent English from Canadian and American soldiers before the war.

Its exhibits are divided in half between Tokyo and Japan\u2019s older and modern history (Before and after the Meiji revolution of 1868). The displays include life-size artifacts in addition to many smaller-scale models of buildings and neighbourhoods. They even have binoculars set around them for you to examine them up close.

I recommend that if you are there between 1000 and 1500 use the voluntary guides as most of the signage had minimal English explanation. I enjoyed the exhibitions and the attempt to make some of it a hands on. Great photo opportunities make it a personal experience but I still rated it a 4 and not a 5 because I felt like I was in a warehouse.

Shows on music and performances are available.Strongly recommended to anyone visiting Japan, it's worthwhile a visit (tickets not expensive at all)."

The layout was great and was a timeline up to the upcoming Olympics memorabilia. This is definitely a good choice for a museum while you are in Tokyo!"

The free English speaking guides were not available when I was there. So, I checked out a set of headphones. Unfortunately, English explanations of exhibits were available for only a handful of the permanent exhibits and none of the special exhibits. I felt the museum was more for Japanese visitors than American visitors."

Unlike many history museums which can be staid and boring, this one really brings the history to life through use of artifacts, recreations, films, etc all laid out in a very interesting manner. Highly recommended. The museum is right near the JR and Toei Oedo Ryogoku train stations.

When you entered the museum, you will go to the top level (6th floor), then you'll be greeted with the beautiful hall with wooden bridge connecting the two side of the building.. With relatively cheap entrance ticket (only 600 yen per person, even free admission for children below 5 y.o), you get a great experience of Tokyo in the past.. For non-Japanese speaker, it is recommended to either rent an audio-speaker guide (for free, but you need to deposit cash in the locker) or you could \"hire\" a english-speaking volunteer on the 6th level entrance."

Minuses are less than intuitive directionals and limited English signage. Free English speaking guides are available, though. Fine gift shop at the end."

Lots of history of Edo, which is what Tokyo used to be called. Edo was the capital of Japan in the Shogun days. They have all kinds of displays and even miniature model of central Edo and life size replica of Japanese bridge. Lots of fun with children. It may be helpful if you read beforehand a little bit about the history of Japan especially the period of the Tokugawa Shogunate when Edo/Tokyo was the seat of government.Only about $5 for entry fee.

I really wished that this had existed when I lived in Japan 25 years ago, as it explained so much that I didn't understand then. This is more of a modern museum with plenty of life-size reconstructions and dioramas taking visitors through the history of Tokyo, from its founding as Edo under the Tokugawa Shogunate through to the modern day. This includes some unique insights into life in the lead-up to and during WWII.There are some amazingly detailed reconstructions of street scenes from Tokyo's history and daily domestic life. There is enough English signage to make the visit worthwhile if you don't speak Japanese. Apparently the English guides are good if you are nervous about the amount of Japanese, but speaking both languages, I though the English signage was just fine.  The museum provides insights into daily life and who the Japanese are that as a tourist you can't normally get by visiting the temples and shrines. There are some interesting insights into the commuter and \"salaryman\" cultures which dominated so much of 20th century Japan.There is enough to keep kids interested and if you relate them back to your own country then it will be quite an educational experience."

Firstly, I would definitely recommend getting an audio guide- they don't cost anything other than a returnable deposit, and although they basically tell you what is written on the stands, it means you can peruse at your leisure. There are also some foreign language tours, which we were unable to attend as we were at the mercy of an 18 month old's attention span!There are some very interesting artefacts and models which give an insight into life in Edo, the origin of the Tokyo we know now. However, towards the end of the visit I started to feel like my brain was trying to process too much information, I'd recommend skipping bits if there's an exhibition futher on that you know you want to look at. Personally I found the Tokyo at war section really interesting and poignant. It was interesting to hear about the war from a Japanese perspective.There's a really nice gift shop (one of the nicest we found actually) selling souvenirs.Top tip! They are very strict about no eating or drinking, even for babies, so don't make the mistake we did and try to sneak your child a quick snack to keep them going if you want to avoid a telling off by the eagle eyed attendants!"

This was by far one of my highlights while visiting Tokyo as I didn't expect much from this museum as I had been to a lot of temples, shrines and a few other museum since my arrival to Japan and they simple left me wanting more. This museum gives great insight to the Edo area and somewhat leans into why Japan is still very different from other countries around the world and why the Japanese seem to be multiple people at times. As they say two faced, public face and private face. I am so coming back to this museum on a future visit to Japan as I was so interested and it was a lot of information to take in all at once. A bit overwhelming. Warning though this is not a artifact Museum but rather a history museum but by far worth the visit. For Artifacts visit the prefectures Castles that are spread out across Japan."

Some of the displays cover the Kanto Earthquake of 1923 which perhaps explains the lack of items as along with the WW2 bombings much of the Edo historical items have been sadly lost. The best aspect of the museum was the architectural design of the building which is quite futuristic and striking when viewed from behind. For me it was only worth visiting as I was going to the Sumo stadium next door. If you are interested in the history of Tokyo / Japan I would suggest visiting the Tokyo national museum in Ueno park instead, which has a far greater collection and has the longest history of all museums in Japan holding 87 national treasures."

There are very few examples left in Tokyo of the \"Old Japan\" but if you want to get a good understanding of the cultural journey Japan has been on in the last 150 years then the Edo Museum is well worth a couple of hours of your time. Fascinating artifacts, models and restored buildings all under a cavernous space, Plenty of seating to rest your weary legs, metro station nearby or walk back up the river path to Asakusa and the Kanimari Gate. Signs are in English so its easy to understand the story."

We went after a lovely tempura lunch in a place near the station and the line of people waiting to get tickets into the museum was very long but the ticket sellers were pretty efficient and soon got us in. I was even able to use my Australian pension card to get the concession price which was very nice.We elected to have an English speaking guide and that was well worth while , she explained the history and changing times of Tokyo very well. They have some marvellous exhibitions. It shows the change from the Eddo era to the Meiji era which was the end of the Samurai times then the modernization of Japan. There are some old transport items there like bicycles and carts which you can sit on, good for a photo. We then visited another section of the museum where they had an excellent exhibition of Ukiyoe Art. This is an ancient art form that has been done in Japan for centuries . Beautifull work some of it very old and extremely valuable. The exhibition had been put together from Museums and private collectors from around the world. There were literally thousands of people filing slowly past these great works of art. There was a shop there where you can buy copies of most items. A interesting place to see some history of Tokyo and how it has changed from era to era, well worth a visit."

These vary from full scale reproductions of buildings and the Nihonbashi bridge, to swords and dioramas. There are English descriptions but they are often only a few words where the Japanese text is much longer, so you can't help but feel that you're missing out a bit. Also we visited at the same time as some school groups which was incredibly annoying. Japan doesn't seem to discipline school kids at all so they just run around screaming.I'm not sure I'd recommend this museum, it's quite out of the way and I think of only superficial interest to those who don't read Japanese or have a grasp of Japanese history."

As other reviewers have stated, the museum provides an excellent overview of the history of Edo and Tokyo including extensive artifacts, models and other descriptive materials. Very good English signs and both guides and audio-self guides are available.I was disappointed with the WWII/Pacific War exhibit however. They had a detailed depiction of the bombing and of destruction of Tokyo which was a horrifying event. However, there was a complete lack of context for why this happened. It was presented as if the Americans just decided to show-up and destroy their capital. Nothing was mentioned about Pearl Harbor and that Japan started a war of aggression first against China and then a sneak attack on the US. Nothing was mentioned of atrocities committed by Japan against Chinese civilians and US service men and women. I'm sure many school children visiting this museum will get a very distorted view of history which is quite disappointing for an institution like this. There was also very little on occupation and reconstruction and I don't think MacArthur was mentioned once. It would be great if they readdress this aspect of their history a bit more before the 2020 Olympics.Anyway, it's definitely worth a few hours while in Tokyo."

It's about a 25 minute walk from there.The building itself is interesting architecturally, apparently modelled after a storehouse. The exhibits range from intricate dioramas to large replicas of historic buildings and bridges. More interestingly, you get a great sense of what Tokyo was like during the Edo period, and incredibly, how many times Tokyo has been rebuilt. I'd recommend getting the audio guide.

Hokusai is best known as author of the woodblock print series 36 Views of Mount Fuji (\u5bcc\u5dbd\u4e09\u5341\u516d\u666f Fugaku Sanj\u016broku-kei) which includes the internationally recognized print, The Great Wave off Kanagawa, created during the 1820s.Our visit took just under 3 hours. However I find that the signage/explanation in English is still not too sufficient, though audio guides are available. Before parting we ate at the small cafe (good udon noodles) at L1. There\u2019s also a few museum souvenir shops which sells good traditional craft, T-shirts and cutie collectibles. A good grab for interesting-theme shorts that is not available elsewhere. :>A Bonus - one can also make a short detour to the Ryogoku Sumo museum just about 10 minutes from the museum."

Many models are very detailed and carefully made so that they tell stories very good (even though most of the time you don't know what they are from reading the explanation, .... because they are mostly in Japanese!) The artifacts are either carefully made to duplicate the original one or the original one itself. There are English speaking guides available but I haven't tried them. This is an enjoyable museum for all ages and genders, one of the best I've ever visited."

We arrived 2 hours before close so didn't have a volunteer tour guide to assist us and didn't use the audio tour. The signs had enough English that we could understand most of what we saw. The kids liked that the place had a lot of space to run around, some items to touch and try out and interesting life size models to see. My husband and I enjoyed learning about how Tokyo was formed and what hardships it went through. We only got 3 days in the city and I think spending some time here to better understand the city was worth it. Small fee of 600 adults to enter."

A heads-up, please tell your guide how much time you have to visit the museum, as we had to tell her when we were there for 2 hours that we had to be somewhere else. There is a wonderful gift shop, and the restaurant on the top floor has Japanese food-actually quite good. It is also fun to stroll the neighborhood, as you often see a sumo wrestlers. I also swing into the Sumo stadium to show them that museum and they have a sumo-themed gift shop."

This museum covers the history of Tokyo (Edo) from approximately 1600- to post war reconstruction and does so in an interesting and entertaining way. There are a number of scale models, dioramas and hands-on activities that keep even young children from getting too bored. (however, this is not a children's museum)The museum is fairly large, even if you are not that into history it is good to allow at least a few hours to go through the whole place. There is adequate signage in English, but you are better off getting an audio-guide to fully appreciate what you are seeing. There are also volunteer guides available if you want a more personal tour. These guides are available in a number of languages including French, German, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Korean (besides Japanese and English) but for many of these languages you need to reserve in advance so check their website. The audio guide is free and requires no reservation, just get one on either the 1st or 3rd floor information counters (must give a refundable 1000 yen deposit) These are only in Japanese, Korean, Chinese and English so plan ahead if these languages don't work for you.The main permanent exhibits are on the 5th and 6th floors, if you start on the 6th floor and work your way down to the 5th, going from the \"Edo-zone\" to the \"Tokyo-zone\", you will follow things in chronological order. The other reviewers and photos posted basically tell you what you need to know"

Took longer than expected, so be prepared to spend more than a few hours there. We went back twice, once for the main exhibit and once for the special exhibit, but still did not see all we wanted to. By the end we were rushing through because we had to meet others at a specific time. Basically make sure you give yourself a full day (open-close) to see everything at a leisurely pace.Favourite exhibit was the WW2 exhibit, very detailed and full of information. Full of thought provoking reading material, I did not realize a few things before I went to the museum that I know now.All in all, go. If your going to visit a couple of museums make sure this is one of them."

If you are a museum person and typically put such visits at the top of your agenda when you travel, this place should be your first stop in Tokyo. I put this facility in the top 10 museums I have ever visited. This is partly because I tend to be a history buff but also because this place is so well done. This museum presents the chronology of the city of Tokyo and, somewhat by default, the nation of Japan as a whole. It is superbly presented. I have visited this museum three times. The first time was on my own and the second was with my family when we brought them to Tokyo. This most recent visit was with four colleagues who had never been here. This occasion was a little different as it was the first time I used one of the free volunteer guides. This gave the experience a wholly worthwhile added dimension. Having a native interpretation that gave information not available on the placards was invaluable. Beyond this, however, the displays in this museum were top notch. Upon entering, the replica of the old Nihonbashi bridge greets you with an invitation you cannot refuse. The Kabuki theater re-creation below the bridge also is impressive to view. The three dimensional miniatures showing various aspects of Old Tokyo are worth studying. Various areas of the museum are dedicated to different eras of Tokyo. The display on the war years was particularly fascinating to me. I would highly recommend this museum to anyone wanting to learn more about the history of this fascinating city. Take half a day to experience this gem!"

First thing first, get your tickets at the lobby- it's only 600 yen per person- so cheap!2. There are 2 options for non-japanese speaker, either rent an audio electronic guide next to the ticket counter for free (deposit of 1000yen) or I ---Highly--- recommend getting a volunteer english guide on level 6. They are so professional, they will tell you the history of edo-tokyo (all about samurai and shoguns) while guiding you around the museum, they can answer all of your questions and... its free of charge too! I find this service amazing!3. Take lots of photos on the 5th floor with the olden days bicycles- its so cute. 4. Just enjoy your time at the museum, browse thru the collections slowly. 5. They also have two japanese cafes that serves traditional bentos one on the top floor and the other on the bottom floor. Just a couple of hours at the museum really broadened my knowledge about the history of Tokyo, the temples, the shogun and samurai Era, even.... why do japanese like sushi so much! :)"

            "review": "Entering this museum over the replica of the original wooden, arched Edo bridge is an exceptional introduction. During the 17th century the original Edo Bridge was a terminus of the Nakasendo Road through the mountains between Edo and Kyoto. Subsequently the wooden bridge was replaced by a stone bridge, which still stands today, though now lost in the midst of the Tokyo big city concrete structures around it. Traditionally, all distances in Japan are measured from the centerpoint of the Nihonbashi Bridge, this custom began in the Edo Period; road signs showing the distance to Tokyo actually state the number of kilometres to Nihonbashi.The museum is photo and explore friendly with directional signs incorporated in the carpet which is helpful to avoid missing exhibits in such a large place. The exhibits both full size and miniature are meticulously presented; hours can be spent in both learning and admiring the craftsmanship and quality of the exhibits. After leaving the Museum stroll around under the base of this huge, elevated structure to get a sense of the size of this massive building."

This museum ranks amongst the best I've ever seen for a local museum, and I highly recommend an easy trip here from most areas of the city. It's a few minutes by train from Ueno for example, and the museum is right outside the station. Depending on the season you're in Tokyo, a rainy day could hit. We had sun yesterday, and heavy drizzle all day today. So this museum makes an excellent substitution, or a nice half day in connection with other nearby areas. I didn't expect the museum to be as large and comprehensive as we found it to be. The displays and models are simply remarkable. There are plenty of items behind glass cases, which are very interesting. But the models of Edo and the recreations of houses, stores, and many other buildings really take you inside another era in grand fashion. My kids enjoyed it, and we weren't in a mad rush to get through as a result. So keep it in mind, especially if you have a bad weather day or days you'd like to mix up your sightseeing routine. I don't think you'll be disappointed, and that's from a non-museum guy!!Also as you're headed out of the station to your right there's a large restaurant, an izikaya really. We stopped there on our way back after a morning at the museum, and it was perfect for our family. Nice character, private tables, big menu and selection, and a good break before grabbing the train back to Ikebukuro. Just a thought..."

This was my second visit to the Edo Tokyo Museum and I was surprised that I enjoyed it just as much as the first visit (which was admittedly some years ago during a High School trip). We took the Oedo Subway line to the Ryogoku stop which drops you almost to the entrance of the building, which from the outside looks more like a sports stadium. The entrance fee to the permanent exhibits in the museum was \u00a5600 for adults - which I think is very reasonable for a Tokyo attraction. Once on the 6th floor (accessed via an elevator), before you cross the bridge there is a desk where you can ask for a volunteer tour guide.I would really recommend getting a guide as we asked so many questions and got so much insights on the exhibit items and Japanese culture/history in general. You just won't have the same experience without it. Our tour guide was so obliging, answering all questions and was obviously very passionate/knowledgeable about the subject. He even has his own website where you can refresh your memory on some of the information, along with photos of all the people he's taken for a tour through the museum. The tour takes about 1.5 hrs - and doesn't seem to matter about the size of your group whether you're a sole person or bigger group. The best thing is that the guide service is absolutely FREE! We noticed that apart from English, there were volunteer guides in languages such as French, German, Spanish, Russian, Chinese etc.If you have a spare few hours in Tokyo, have a general interest in history or traditional Japanese culture - I would recommend a visit to the Edo Tokyo Museum."

As soon as we stepped into the museum a japanese man walked up to us and offered to act as a volunteer guide, which was free of charge. We took him up on his offer and it was excellent as it was much better than walking around looking at the exhibits - much more of a personal perspective. As we were coming to the end of the tour I started to think about whether we should offer him a tip, but he said goodbye and dissappeared before we had the chance to do so - which was a relief.I would put this museum down as a must-see in Tokyo if you want to find out about history and culture. If you're not interested in this stuff, then why go to Tokyo?"

Long before Japan became this high-tech country with automatic toilet bidet or automatic car park, here's your chance to check out the Era of Edo period. It's pretty fascinating really. There were lots of miniatures of the old neighbourhood of Tokyo. You can see ow Japanese used to dress up, what the traditional houses with futon and tatami looks like. I suggest for foreigners to sign up for a guide from the 6th floor, it's a free service and they speak many languages. Our guide was so passionate about telling us the history of Japan, about the Era with Shogun and Samurai. We learned so much in one trip. The location of the museum is perfect, just 5 minutes from Ryogoku Station and the ticket price is so cheap 600 yen. If its the right season, you can also go see a sumo match at the Ryogoku major sumo stadium about 10 minutes from the museum. *highly recommendable* I reckon this is one of the best museums in Tokyo, definitely worth to go!"

Favourite exhibits were the excellent models of Edo castle, the Edo screens and the demonstration of how woodblock multicolored prints were made. Also interesting to see c18 cartoon books (showing that Manga was nothing new) and a temporary exhibit of woodblock prints of warriors. The document of WW2 surrender by the Japanese is also on display, if in a rather understated context within the Tokyo section of the museum which also showed its development into a city and constant vigilance for earthquakes. The whole visit took about 3 hours. Enough signage in English to understand exhibits, and audioguides were also available. We ate at the small cafe ( good udon noodles ) but a wider choice of Japanese food was available on the top floor. Easy to reach via the subway, next to the Sumo stadium ( if you are fortunate enough to time your visit to see a basho)."

Other exhibits give detailed information about the Edo period and the development of modern Tokyo. I found the displays to be of the highest caliber and well-maintained. The only real drawback is the lack of information in English. What English signs there are give just the bare minimum facts. It would be helpful to go with someone willing to translate for you, if you can. I was lucky to have Japanese friends who explained a lot to me.

The museum is about cultural history of Edo/Tokyo during the Tokugawa Shogunate era (when the samurais ruled Japan from their Edo headquarter, and the emperors were figureheads in Kyoto) and the Meiji period (when the emperor became the ruler of Japan again). Few key features of this museum: 1) a reconstructed Nihonbashi bridge. The apex of the bridge is considered the epicenter of Japan; all roads lead to Nihonbashi. 2) a kabuki theater. 3) Edo lifestyle models. 4) 1923 Tokyo Earthquake We went early (10 am) and got one of the volunteer museum guide to give us a private tour (in English) for nearly two hours. Without her we would not have nearly appreciated the museum as we had. She explained very clearly how the Tokugawa Lords set up the society and the samurai hierarchy. The first Tokugawa was definitely a very clever man. He set up system to make sure that his descendants would never be without a male heir. He set up his government and subordinate structure such that nobody could ever rebel against him or his successor. And he set up the society such that the rich merchants would be below the poor farmers in hierarchy. Etc, etc.This is not the museum for young children.

            "review": "Interesting Tokyo history museum & good value for \u00a5600. Using the access information on the musuem website, this museum was really easy to find (it's right by Ryogoku station on the Metro Oedo line and the JR Sobu line and is signposted well).I paid for access to the permanent exhibitions only which was \u00a5600 and this entitled me to see plenty of things in the museum and overall I felt was excellent value for a museum of this size/standard. The special exhibits seemed expensive to me (an extra \u00a5680) and I wasn't really attracted by the current special exhibit topic so I did not pay the extra to go into it. Having looked at a museum map, the size of the special exhibit looked quite small in comparison to the whole museum so I was glad I didnt pay the extra to visit it.If you do not read Japanese, I would strongly recommend that you try and book a volunteer tour guide to take you around the museum. Details on how to do this are on the museum website and you need to book ideally at least 2 weeks before your visit. However, I think it is also possible to just get a guide on the day if there is one available but they were all fully booked when I visited (a busy Sunday). If you cannot get a guide then I would instead recommend that you use the audio guide. It requires a \u00a51,000 redundable deposit. I think that the museum would still be enjoyable without either a guide or an audio guide, however you will probably miss out on things if you don't use either.This is a very 'hands-on' history museum about the history of Tokyo during the Edo period and up to the 20th Century (it finishes with a section on the 1964 Olympics). Try and follow the arrows on the floor as this takes you around in chronological order. I visited alone but I think this museum would be great for families as there are many exhibits which you can 'try' e.g. you can climb inside the old imperial Palanquins , you can climb onto old bicycles and you can have a go at carrying water buckets. There is also a traditional Japanese house with tatami flooring that you can go inside (providing you take your shoes off of course!). You are also allowed to take photos (no flash) so can get some good shots of trying out the exhibits!I visited the museum alone and spent about an hour and a half just mooching around. I am sure that if I visited with a friend/partner then I would have spent much longer here as trying out the 'hands on' bits would have been more fun!The museum shops have some great little souvenir items so are well worth a look if you are on holiday and want some mementos/souvenirs/gifts. The prices are generally reasonable. Toilet facilities are also good here.I had planned to eat at the museum restaurant and the cafes/restaurants all looked reasonably priced. However, they all had big queues so I instead nipped over the road to the McDonalds opposite Ryogku station and had lunch for half the price and in a quarter of the time! The museum ticket allows you to go in and out during the day of validity, however I did not go back in after lunch as I had seen everything.Overall a nice museum and not a typical boring history museum. Well worth a morning of my time in Tokyo!"

Being very interested in history, I enjoy visiting museums and the Edo-Tokyo Museum is the one I picked as the most appropriate to see in Tokyo. I wasn't disappointed but without a volunteer personal guide, we would have been struggling to fully understand the implication of some of the exhibits. I am a bit reluctant normally to go on guided tours, preferring my own pace, but I would recommend it in this case. Our guide's English was excellent and her knowledge of Japanese history was very good.The highlight of the museum for me was the reconstruction of buildings inside. Very well done and enjoyable. One negative was the short signs and written explanations in English. An audio guide, as in Europe, would be handy as I imagine on busier days there wouldn't be enough personal guides for every visitor."

The Tokyo section is about when Japan began to open up to the west in the Meiji Era to the recent events of WW2. The museum is also very foreigner friendly as almost all of the displays have explanation in English, it is also right next to a subway line making it easy of access.

By 1721, Edo had grown into the world's largest city with a population of 1 million. Various historic items testify the flourishing of urban culture under the Tokugawa Shogunate. Also, how people's life changed dramatically after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 is vividly shown. I felt that some parts of history are not represented strongly enough, such as class discrimination under the Shogunate and the underclass; the aristocracy under the Meiji Regime; Tokyo as the metropole of the Japanese Empire and Colonialism; the killings of the Koreans, Chinese, and Socialists by the vigilante groups in the aftermath of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (which is explained in brief, but does not explain in depth as to who where responsible and why they were targeted); Women's liberation movement and ban of prostitution in Yoshiwara; the occupation and the problematic reforms after WW2; The US-Japan Security Treaty and the Anpo Riots of 1969-1970. Perhaps the general conservative to rightist political tendencies of Tokyo mayors have had some indirect effect on what to display (and what not to) in the museum, and I find that a bit disconcerting. That said, this is a pretty good museum that should be interesting to many people unfamiliar with Tokyo's history. Also, the museum shops on 5th floor and at the basement has items suitable for souvenirs at reasonable prices. Recommended."

We began walking through the earliest history period section and were very disappointed to see how very little was translated to English (this is fine because we are foreign tourists, but in a history museum I think objects are just objects unless you know their significance). My husband and I walked around a little bit forlornly, realizing we would not get the full experience. BUT WAIT, what is that I hear? English! We found a female volunteer dressed in kimono providing an English tour to two British tourists and began basically stalking this tour. The stories she was telling were just so interesting that we would inch our way behind the group as they moved from display to display. Finally we asked the British tourists if we could join their tour and they were very gracious and said yes. Our experience immediately improved 100% and we heard a lot of wonderfully colored stories from the volunteer tour guide. Her English was very good and she was very hospitable. We learned later that you can request a tour several months in advance and up until 2 or 3 pm based on availability (you might want to look into this more if you're planning a trip). The museum has many very interesting displays and we found that as the museum moved into more modern eras, more of the displays were translated into English, though we still learned more from our guide than what was printed out. There is plenty to see a few things to actually do--you can sit inside a rickshaw, try to ring the fire alarm, etc. The section on WWII was what I found most interesting. This was a great way to spend an afternoon."

It offers something for everyone, from casual observers to aficionados and from children to adults. It is roughly divided into two parts, the \u201cEdo\u201d section and the \u201cTokyo\u201d section.The \u201cEdo\u201d Zone: The escalator brings you to the 6th floor, where you can walk across a life sized version of the Nihonbashi bridge while viewing the Nakamura Kabuki Theater and Choya Newspaper Publishing Co. from afar. Small dioramas of town life along with a model of Edo castle are on the other side. On the lower level the \u201cEdo\u201d zone continues, covering daily life in the city and including culture, commerce, and entertainment among other topics. This is mostly done in the context of life-size dioramas, all of which were quite comprehensive. The \u201cEdo\u201d zone ends at the Nakamura kabuki theater and leads into\u2026The \u201cTokyo\u201d Zone: This covers the Meiji restoration, Great Kanto earthquake, modern Tokyo, and the air raids from B-29s during WW2 among other topics in the same excellent fasion.Summary: I went here twice during my week in Tokyo, it was that good. The English signage is adequate and there are numerous interactive exhibits along the way (palanquin, rickshaw) that kids would enjoy.

The museum is best appreciated after you've been in Tokyo for at least a couple of days, so you've begun to understand a little about the present-day city.Exhibits tell about the rise of the city from a fishing viliage on the mudflats to the largest in the world, and its resurrections from fire, earthquake, politcal upheaval and war. There are dioramas of the palace and everyday neighborhoods that are so big and detailed that binoculars are provided. Plenty of clear signs in many languages."

The headsets are pretty much a waste of time because they really only narrate what is already posted in English and the signal isn't so great, however they are free (you have to pay a deposit which you get back) so it couldn't hurt to try it. If you can join a tour do so. There are volunteer tour guides who conduct tours in several different languages. I would really recommend this because not every display has an English discription."
