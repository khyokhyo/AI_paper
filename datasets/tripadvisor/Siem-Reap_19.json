People usually go there to explore a feeling of inner peace, since when you get there, you would feel no interrupted and feel relaxed. A hidden God is on the wall if you notice thoroughly. That is a great place and can make you excited as well."

At the elevated levels the view is quite good. It is necessary to note where one goes up and to try to get down at the same place (down the same stairs) because going down at another location could get you confused. It is very large and takes a while to walk around once."

The Baphuon is a huge temple near the more famous Bayon temple, but as it was built in the 11th Century it predates it by 200 years.Originally built as a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva, it was converted to a Buddhist temple in the 15th Century.The Baphuon was built on sand and was inherently unstable from the beginning, which goes a long way to explaining its sorry state of repair compared to many of the other monuments at the Angkor Archaeological Park. Attempts have been made to restore parts of the temple, but it is a mammoth task.One of the features to look for is a massive reclining Buddha which lies across the entire western wall of the temple. It is also in a sorry state of repair, so you have to look closely and use your imagination to work out its dimensions and shape."

The view of the grounds from the highest accessible level was breathtaking.After being out and about for the whole day, I'd been a bit tired, but Baphuon woke me right up and reminded me: Dude. You're in Angkor.Don't pass it up!"

Baphuon Temple is a great sight in comparison to the more well-known temples in Angkor Thom and the surrounding region, because it has less people and a FANTASTIC view at the top! My tip is to start at the front, walk down the elevated processional walkway (great for catching a cool photo of orange-clad monks hurrying down it) and admire the grounds in front, then find your way to the top. When I went, I was the only one at the top for several minutes, and the view of the pounds, processional walkway, and the building itself was the best one I had among the ruins of Siem Reap!"

You can observe a reclining Buddha that was attempted to mark this transition. Amazingly steep steps lead you all the way to the top and are a great workout.

Baphuon temple ,originall built dedicated to Hindu God Shiva, will be the second spot in Angkor Thom Complex after visiting Bayon Temple . the Baphuom Temple Complex is fantastically built in a pyramidal structure the long path walk way from main entrance leading the temple is beautifully built in a elevated platform . There is a swimming pool tank at the left side of the walk way to harvest water during the ancient regime. The temple is so precisely engineered in such a manner the structure's base is built heavily and broadened in a three tier -structure , Its requires a knee breaking job to climb the pinnacle of the temple top crest , where we can take some of the breath taking views and photograph of the temple tombs , leapers. At the rear side of the temple we can see a huge reclining statue of Bhudda , which is simply amazing and the spectacular construction of the face of Buddha by assembling huge stones and carving it but it is incomplete . The temple has been restored using Anastylosis method. Most of the temple rumbled and collapsed stones was dismantled and the hundreds of thousands of stones laid out and numbered and re-assembled and erected to complete the structure . The unstable base of the monument was reinforced. Several decades of restorations took place and the Baphuon was opened to the public . Its really a marvelous engineering that Khmer King Udayadityavarman II has evolved centuries ago in Erecting such a magnificent Three-tired temple in 11 th century."

We saw all of the best-known temples, plus several off the beaten track (thank you, our excellent guide). Why was this my favorite? It wasn't the fact that it wasn't nearly as crowded as adjacent Bayon, although that was a very good thing. It wasn't the view from the top of the stairs, although it was very rewarding. It was the outline of the reclining Buddha which one can only see near the exit. It was almost eerie, and a reminder of the stages this complex has gone through over hundreds of years. Very cool.2 thumbs way up!"

It is accessed from a long terraced path which is used to serve as a bridge on a pool of water. The stairs to the top are very steep but there is a newly built wooden steps, less steep, on one side. Highly recommended. Do note, there was a local boy trying to collect signature of tourist. I doubt he was trying to beg. Say no thanks, and ignore him."

You could easily take a decision not to spend the time walking to it and or up it, but both are worthwhile. Given the stairs etc this was not a child friendly temple and in actual fact they were not aloud up. However the kids and spent time exploring the surrounds and really loved it - from the back their is a huge reclining budah that you could easily miss if you didn't know it was there. My wife on the other hand climbed to the top. She talked of it being extremely peaceful and serene with a beautiful view of the jungle canopy. She said there were butterflies and she enjoyed it very much. Id say its one of the understated temples of the area, right near some of the favourites so worth the investment of an additional 30 minutes to check it out."

It's on the small side, and there's not much to see. That being said, I definitely say \"go!\" if the weather is on the average side - we had just spent a long time at Bayon and were totally overheated, and Bayon is so grand and stunning that going directly here in 100+ degree heat in direct sunlight was not the best time. Also, a minor warning: There are a decent amount of steps in the temple, which wouldn't be as much of an issue if they weren't so steep. One of my friends chose to climb them on \"all fours,\" whereas I needed to hold onto both railings to feel secure. The way up is steep, but keep in mind the way down is an identical set of stairs - you need to take them very slowly and carefully or you could easily slip and fall. We are all in our 20s and this was manageable for us, but could be bad for young children and older people."

If you stood on top of Phimeanakas you'll have a nice view of the Baphuon temple. This temple was built around 1150 AD by King Udai Adityavarman II, he dedicated the temple to the Hindu god Shiva. In the 20th century a large part of the temple collapsed, inter alia earthquakes. In 1960 there has been an attempt to rebuild the temple, but when this was not allowed by the Khmer regime. They have made a second attempt in 1996, but this failed. In 2003 it managed and restored much of the temple. As archaeologists did not have the location of all the stones not everything could be restored."

Based on previous reviews, the reclining Buddha is located on the west side."

It is very dull and dim, and if you look at it very alertly only, your eyes can find it. This temple was built of sand stone, and due to its huge, immense size, this has been unstable in the years to come. Large portions are already in ruins. It's architectural style is Khmer. Our group consisted of 6 people, and a private tour had been arranged. The Angkor Tour Guide Service took care of us so well.

Too bad the topmost section is closed off but from the highest platform it does look like a \"Stairway to Heaven\".

From the main road, you have to walk a couple of hundred metres on an elevated pathway to reach the base of the temple. The climb is steep so they don't allow kids below 12. Due to eh presence of Ta Prohm, Angkor Vat and Bayon, this temple often gets overlooked, so its comparatively less noisy and the views from the top are spectacular. There was originally a reclining Buddha on the top, however, not much remains now. Most people climb the temple for the views and the remains of the Buddha, thereby missing the hidden gems. On the 2nd level of the temple (it s a 3 level temple) there is a covered walkway on all sides, with stairs to the upper level on the north, east, west and south. The base of the stairways are covered with a chamber and on the outside walls of these chambers are brilliant bas reliefs depicting scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata - the two great Indian epics, not surprising since this was, originally a Shiva temple. You will miss these carvings if you walk through the walkway, you will have to get out on the platforms between the walkway and the base of the upper level to see these. The same ticket for the Angkor Archaeological Park is valid here.If you suffer from altophobia (fear of heights) or vertigo, please do not try to climb, its quite dizzy, especially while climbing down the stairs."

This temple's structure is much simpler than the other temples in Angkor Thom but it makes up for that with its size. I was very impressed by how massive this temple looked and by the pillar-supported walkway at the entrance. The temple is really tall and you can climb up stairs to get all the way up to the top. Watch out for the steep steps though. The view at the top is fairly refreshing and you'd be quite surprised when you realize that you've gone up all those stairs! This visit was part of an itinerary planned out by our tuk tuk driver. It included Angkor Wat and most places in Angkor Thom. Walking around from temple to temple can get very exhausting (especially around noon) so I recommend resting adequately beforehand, using sunblock and drinking as much water as you can. And wear knee-covering pants when coming here; otherwise you might be denied access to certain temples."

Seemingly it is not a big as it seems, but it does stand out proud and would appear to be a fairly intact structure. The day we visited the gate was closed at the bottom of the steps leading up so we didn't venture to the top and possibly missed out on some great views if you read these other reports here on TA.

The first stage is reached by a wood staircase with metal railings - better and more reassuring than the rickety narrow wood staircase at Phimeanakas. At the first level were long galleries with gopuras at certain points. It was also delightful to see bas-reliefs, some with animals, and the ubiquitous apsaras. The higher levels are reached by yet another steep wooden stairs. The view from the top is great, and the breeze keeps one cool even in the heat of a Cambodian afternoon. The galleries, though, are ruined, reduced only to columns. At the middle sits the ruined central tower, its four steps of laterite cordoned off. I went down and then, at the back, saw the rough outline of the massive reclining Buddha that was carved onto the back of the Hindu temple when it turned Buddhist.For its complexity and the great views, as well as being a prime example of monument restoration, Baphuon Temple is definitely worth a visit!"

It's a three-tiered temple with the typical steep stairs and the view from the top was alright - don't expect to see an overhead view of too many things nearby, it's not \"that\" tall a structure. The climb, although steep, was not too difficult thanks to the railings. Just remember that going down is more tricky sometimes when the steps are narrow. It's still well worth the climb if you can manage it, for the satisfaction of getting the top."

It was originally built in the 11th Century but large portions of it had collapsed over the centuries. When reconstruction began in the 20th Century, a 300 member team found 300,000 pieces of the temple surrounded by a jungle. It was like trying to put together a large jigsaw puzzle but they were successful and reconstruction is now complete.

The Baphuon was originally a Hindu temple built in the 11th century but it was later converted to a Buddhist temple in the late 15th century. It is actually located within the walls of the ancient royal capital city of Angkor Thom and sits only about 200m northwest of the Bayon Temple.As the temple complex was built on sandy soil, much of the original structure had crumbled and collapsed and restoration work on the extensive ruins in later years have proven very difficult. Now, the officially restored temple draws a fairly good crowd and there are still many stone sculptures and bas reliefs on the walls and they are in fairly good condition. Although fully restored for viewing, there were still many stone slabs and blocks lying around the temple grounds waiting to be fitted into the big jigsaw puzzle. There\u2019s no denying that the restoration work done thus far has been nothing short of fantastic and retains the many original features found in the ancient Khmer architecture.We visited the temple ruins during the rainy spell and both sides of the causeway leading to the temple complex were flooded with most of the vegetation under water. The temple building itself was a three-tier structure and built on a high square base and the highest level we ascended to was at least 30 meters high. Many visitors had decided against climbing up the extremely steep and high staircase to the top and were contented with exploring the lower level perimeter pathway, due the rain which was still drizzling the whole day. Although it was very dangerous, we took the challenge and climbed up the wet wooden steps but fortunately there were metal handrails all along the staircase to at least provide some sense of safety not only when ascending but also when descending by the same way later.After conquering the steep and wet staircase to the topmost level of the Baphuon, it was time to enjoy the breathtaking view from up there. Then it was time to descend and you can imagine the sense of relief when we touched the bottom of the stairs. Phew, what an experience!"

Therefore if you are willing to spend a bit of extra time or be thorough with your visit, Baphuon is a nice place. There are still plenty of people, just LESS people. Baphuon was the Royal Temple of the city, and they are strict about what you're wearing, so ensure your shoulders and knees are covered. They will not hesitate to turn you away if you are not properly covered. There are also a lot of incredibly steep steps but it's worth the climb and the scaffolding is safe, so take your time and enjoy the view once you get up the top.Also be careful walking through some of the low doorways, as I saw a lady hit her head and it looked quite painful. Remember that the people who used these temples were much more petite than many of us nowadays."

Do not miss reading these boards as they give a mountain of information about the amazing restoration process and just gives you the heaviness and the complexity of putting this jigsaw of a temple together --- from the mound of dirt it started from to the temple you climb today. Outstanding difference! They even placed what the temple looked like during the Angkor Thom era (I've also uploaded it for your wonderment). After seeing this picture, you will surely go... I would've loved to see this temple in its fullness back during those day. A fair warning to visitors: even if they have built stairs over the damaged original stairs, these stairs are just as steep as the original ones. It will really test your nerves! The authorities have placed tour routes which give the visitor a route to follow around the temple. You may opt to follow this or not. However, you must at least follow the signs saying if the flight of stairs are for going up or down. It's just basic courtesy to the one going up or down and basic rule-abiding. If you conquered your fears and went up the whole temple mountain, savor your victory by looking at the view from the top. It is not really a great view. It's just tree tops and a view of the causeway and gopura below. Remember the whole area around the temple is forested so other sites will be blocked from view by the trees. Still, savor your victory. It is one of the hardest temple mountains to scale --- you had two flights of steep stairs to go up and there's still the way down. If you go down the first of the two flight of stairs down, before you go to the second, detour to your left and go outside the corridor through the windows on your left. After jumping out of this window, go left again and check out the carvings near the stairs from which you went down from. You will see carvings on the walls of typical animals: birds, deer, horses, etc. It's quite unique since I never saw any of these types of carvings at other temples. If you're done, go down the second flight of stairs.Leave at the back of the temple. Again, you will be seeing information boards, but this time it tells you about a unique sight of this temple. The whole back side of the temple is a figure of a reclining Buddha albeit not initially discernible! Another complexity of the restoration process! Wonderful indeed! DO NOT MISS! It's a unique feature unseen in other Angkor temples. I went to this temple a little past noontime. There were very few people scaling this temple so it made it less troublesome to go up and down the stairs. It was also less noisy. But, it was too hot. Remember to put on some sunscreen first! Do not miss this temple! It's the hardest to scale. It has unique carvings. It has a reclining Buddha carved to the back side of the temple. That's three enough reasons to visit this temple mountain."

This isn't in most of the guidebooks (yet), and has a surprisingly low rating in Trip Advisor, presumably because this temple was recently opened to the public, after restoration work was completed some 2 years ago. I would have missed this, had my tour guide not worked this into the itinerary. What many don't know is that Baphuon is older than Angkor Wat. The view from the top is breathtaking. Best time to see it is now, when the tourist hordes haven't yet discovered it. Couple of helpful tips: (1) Make sure you wear comfortable shoes with a good grip, if you plan to scale up this temple. Baphoun is a mountain temple. Expect to walk up several flights of steep stairwells. The view of Angkor Thom once you reach the top, is worth the effort. (2) Heed the advice, offered by other reviewers, on appropriate attire; i.e. shoulders and knees must be covered. The dress code is strictly enforced."

This is undoubtedly one of the great sites at Angkor; the most Pyramid-like of all the temples. The modern steps up to the top (almost) on the north side of the temple offer a great view. You descend by an equally steep set of steps on the south side.But one important warning: kids under 12, pregnant women and inappropriately dressed people are not allowed in (bare shoulders seemed particularly offensive - carry a scarf in your bag and it will keep them happy). The restriction on kids does, sort of, make sense.....the climb to the top is precipitous. However, there's a question about whether - with appropriate warnings and all the doubtless legal caveats - that should be the responsibility of responsible adults. Therse is not upper age limit but I know that I'd back a 10 year old over an 80 year old to get to the top and down again."

Now, Dec 2010, not yet complete.The temple was built around 1060 A.D., one hundred years before Angkor Wat. The temple, said, measured 50 m high, 130 x 103 m on the base, with 420 x 125 m enclosure, and a 200 m long causeway was built to connect the temple from the entrance gopura. According to my guidebook, the upper part of the temple fall because of the basement of the temple cannot support the weight of the whole temple. This temple is clustered together (or to be more accurate, stick together) with Terrace of Elephants, Terrace of the Leper King, and the Royal Temple. It is just 400 m from Bayon. So, although it might take more time for the temple to reclaim its former glory, it will be no harm for us to stop by and take a visit on it.http://bettyandlingshing.blogspot.com/2010/12/phnom-bakheng-and-baphuon.html"
