I highly recommend this trip if you want to take a short day trip outside of Kathmandu away from the traffic and dust and enjoy the nature and spirituality Nepal has to offer. I also suggest you book a private guide, because its super hard to get to by yourself. My hostel recommended the company Himkala Adventure and the guide was great!"

When I arrived in Kathmandu in the mid-70's Tour Offices near Durbar Square proudly touted the 'thrilling animal sacrifices' that could be seen on Saturdays and Tuesdays at Dakshinkali Temple. Not being interested in seeing innocent creatures put to a cruel death, I never availed myself of the opportunity. Many years later, however, when I was working for a study abroad program here, the orientation weekend was held at the Dakshinkali Resort, located just next door to the temple complex. I have no idea why that particular place was chosen, as it was a decision of my superiors, and it is a lovely and authentic place, quite rustic. It is just the location that is unfortunate. There was no avoiding it, however, so the first morning at dawn, I and about 15 students trooped down the hill to the shrine itself. A ghastly sight and piteous sounds awaited us as the temple priest, in reality no more than a ritual butcher, one by one, and without a trace of grace or sympathy, dispatched the goats, ducks and chickens that were brought to him. The atmosphere, the 'vibe' if you will, was terribly dark and gloomy, as though the pain and suffering of a millennia's worth of sacrificial animals had collected in the narrow valley by the river. Buddhists call this 'killing through ignorance' and consider it no less a non-virtue than any other kind of killing. Not a place to visit unless one is contemplating the suffering of samsara."

The view while you climb is simply amazing and you will not regret taking a bike. Since the hill is steep you can also get a good amount of exercise. There are also many other temples on the way so you can ask the locals there they will guide you. Main attraction of the place apart from the temple is Khuwa(Khoa, you can wiki it, it's like a cheese made by reducing milk by over boiling, that's the best that comes to my mind right now) but you get good Khuwa here so check with the locals and taste before you buy."

Don\u2019t forget that after sacrifices of animals, their owners take them home and eat them. So it is not only meaningless killing animals. I spend hours there just watching people how they sacrificed animals and make ceremonies connected with it. You can also watch how the dead animals are processed. There is one place under the stairs where you can find a people doing it. If you come by bus, after ceremony is finished, be prepared fight with local people about place in the bus back to Kathmandu."

Outside the temple, there are rows of flower shops and shops selling live chickens for sacrifice. We saw a local couple with a kid buy the chicken and it was squeezed and placed in a plastic bag with just its head sticking out (OMG!). Upon entering the temple, the couple placed the chicken with the plastic bag at the altar and went about doing the puja. A good ten minutes later, the chicken in the plastic bag started trying to move and started clucking. The couple immediately alerted a young man who got out his knife, ushered the couple over and cut the chicken's head off. The chicken stopped clucking. The blood - he splashed against the Kali deity and on the couple. We were not too sure of the emotion that we felt right then but it was something along the lines of quirky awe."

I decided to take a Saturday morning visit to see this unique religious experience which is all dedicated to the goddess Kali. Saturdays and Tuesdays are the most significant day, especially Saturday and the line for sacrifices is rather lengthy, but not so bad for tourists and sightseers as they enter through a different way (plus an entrance fee).To get to the sacrificial area, you first must park in the carpark and then walk about 1 kilometre upwards passing stalls selling all manner of souvenirs, trinkets, animals and vegetables (for sacrifice purposes...even vegetables!!), and drinks etc. Once at the entrance to the temple area, you must descend down stairs (approx 100 or less maybe). At the base you cross a bridge which leads closer to the sacrificial area, with a basic butchering facility to the left. You can see many birds snatching the offal which escapes out the drains on the left hand side of the bridge just below the butchering area. This area is for those who wish to prepare the carcass of the sacrificed animal for eating (BBQ/picnic within the surrounding park areas). To the right of the bridge is a small open area (with small water fountains) and a prayer area (where incense and oils are burnt) with an adjacent pathway leading to sacrificial alters.Tourists and visitors can stand and view from outside of the alter areas, but cannot enter. I managed to get a good vantage point and could experience the entire procedure. However, you don't have to go pass this sacrificial area, as you do have to go out of the way to witness this religious act. If you don't want to see this, you can take the main path up pass the prayer area which then leads behind the alter area - finally returning back to a small footbridge that leads back to the \"tourist\" stairs. (NB: You can still experience a wonderful time without the need to expose yourself to the sacrifices, as this is just a small part of the temple area.)Definitely recommend others to experience this significant temple and the surrounds on a half day tour - or incorporate a nearby town for a full day. For me it was a unique and colourful experience with a pleasant walk to and from the temple. (NB: It was very busy on Saturday, but nothing caused any major/inconvenient delays...in fact it was OK.)"

But it\u2019s supposedly one of the most popular worship places in all of Greater Kathmandu, most crowded during the \u201choly\u201d days of Tuesdays and Saturdays (this was Monday) when animal sacrifices are offered to the deity. And yet when we were there, there were still so many people. And we actually got to see a goat sacrifice and chickens too. When we first came, we saw a goat body being chopped up. Then when we were near the altar we saw someone holding the goats head. Yikes! The custom is to leave the chicken head or goat head at the altar. Unless you offer to buy the head then they give it back to you. The guy holding the goat head seemed proud. Some others in is his party would occasionally touch the goat head blood and put it on the forehead of someone younger. And they had the usual 100,000 cotton swabs in bowls that were being burned as part of a thanksgiving ritual. As usual, there were people prodding the bowls with sugar cane sticks, then using those sticks to touch a pregnant woman to ensure it was a boy. I quizzed our guide as to why the site was so popular and he said that most wishes were granted so the word of mouth had spread."

It's a beautiful temple.That said, there are some days you may NOT want to go- if you're unaccustomed to the ritual slaughter of animals.Read about Dakshinkali before you go, it will tell you when the best days to go are--- and a little bit about the importance it has in the Hindu world.Some really good handicraft makers exhibit their goods along the walk down to the site itself- good prices too."

One thing I have noticed in Nepal that the act of sacrifice is still performed in almost all temples which represent the kali faces of Goddess .i have seen this act in Dakhin kali and Mankamana aswell (Manakamana temple is situated on the way to Pokhara from Kathmandu) . It was quite distubing for me to view such an act of sacrifice . Dakhinkali temple is situated in out skirts of kathmandu about 20 km from the city .the place was amaging , on the way we have been to Choubar gorge and Swayambhunath ."

Nevertheless it's a considerably better place than the Kathmandu Abatoir, of course, as the animals are calm to the last. after offerance, the family eat the meat, so nothing is wasted."

If you go to Nepal, hire a guide through the Annapurna Hotel in Kathmandu to take you around the city and surrounding areas. Do not miss going to the Dakshinkali Temple. The sacrifice takes place twice a week. I went on Saturday. The press of the crowd was unbelievable. This is not a spectacle for the weak of heart. Chickens and goats are the sacrificial animals. There is blood everywhere at the sacrificial area.Devotees believe that the goddess will absorb any ill fortune that has befallen them by sacrificing. Interestingly, the animal carcasses, after the sacrifice, are taken to another area, cleaned/plucked and taken home to be consumed. If you really want to see something unusual, then a trip to Dakshinkali Temple is a must."
