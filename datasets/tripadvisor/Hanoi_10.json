It is opposite the infamous Hoa Lo prison, not far from the train station and south of Hoan Kiem lake. I was greeted and persuaded to take a (free) tour (with the friendly Kim/Phuong Anh - thanks!). I thought it was a museum about just the local emergency service, however I learnt that the Hanoi Police force serve to protect the Revolution/ maintain the status quo and have significant political power and high prominence. Their department includes ranks from traffic police to armed crowd control and counterintelligence and even the fire service. Photos of arrested suspects, paraded for publicity, made me feel uneasy. What I enjoyed best was the selection of seized (mainly Western-branded) counterfeit goods and bladed weapons."

We walked by the museum and spontaneously decided to check it out for just a couple of minutes (it's free). That plan turned into almost 45 minutes because of the very nice and funny tour guide. We had a lot of questions about Vietnam and the war and she answered all of them with a lot of insight and humour. One of our highlights of our Vietnam trip, mostly because of the guide!"

It also has a breakdown of the many different ranks in the police. You will have seen lots of different police around Hanoi and now you can find out exactly what they are! It's a nice modern museum to visit after Hoa Lo Prison which is literally a minute round the corner. It won't take you long to see all the exhibits, 30-40 minutes and it's free entry. We didn't see any guides around during our visit on a Saturday early afternoon as there was only a girl at reception. Still, it's quite interesting and worth a look as you will no doubt be in the nearby prison."

She invited me to have a tour of the police museum since i'm there. Then she walked us through each room summarizing the main historical events and achievements of Hanoi police, gave us time to read the information and look at the exhibits before moving on. The information about the French and CIA spies was very interesting as were some of the little side stories and the collection of knives, home gun and other seized goods. All exhibits are explained clearly in Vietnamese, English and French. We were accompanied by Ki (or key - Someone in the museum called her by that name), who was most helpful and friendly. Highly recommended."

Got a great tour from Linh, with lots of interesting information. She speaks excellent English, and made the whole tour not only informative but also fun. I learned a lot about Vietnamese history. The best part of this visit happened at the end of the tour. It was raining a lot, and the staff invited me to join them for lunch (they were celebrating the museum's first birthday, and had a great lunch prepared.) Later on, three more tourists were invited to join (due to the heavy rain it was not very busy). All over, one of my best experiences in Hanoi, and I am really grateful to Linh and the whole museum team for their hospitality, which made these few hours very memorable."

The museum is a great source of political and police history of Vietnam - covering a long period with informative and English language friendly exhibits. We were lucky to have a guide from the museum accompany us which just added to the experience, but even without the guide it would have been just as good to visit. I strongly recommend visiting this museum - it is not a big museum so an hour will easily cover everything, but well worth the investment. Five stars!"

This museum is a PR project more interesting for its design than for its contents (which are pretty much as insipidly pro-police as you would expect). But the museum is obviously very well funded, and has undergone a recent facelift, so it all looks great: the colorful poster-style graphics on the outer doors and windows, a sleek modern interior layout, visitor-friendly exhibits adorned with English captions. They\u2019re clearly very eager for visitors -- the museum is overstaffed with friendly young employees who can\u2019t tell you enough about the achievements of the Vietnamese police in keeping the country free from foreign infiltrators and domestic agitators. There are some confiscated counterfeit goods on display too. And it\u2019s free. Bottom line: this is a nice enough place to stop in for an air-conditioned break from the heat and noise of the city, but don\u2019t expect much real insight."

When we arrived, we were welcomed and then offered the services of a guide to take us around the museum. There is no charge for this and they do not expect to be tipped, what they do is give you an informative history lesson on policing in Hanoi through the centuries. The police museum has only been open for 12months, we spent about 2hrs here and then went across the road to the jail. If you are planning on visiting the jail, add this to your day."

The very first thing that awed me is the state-of-the-art design that i can tell from even the outside appearance. Inside, modern technology in the world was applied to bring about a novel display, specifically the water-proof floor, the look-alike mirror ceiling and the LED light bulbs that do not emit any heat when turned on. All items, objects, and documents on display are organized into distinct topics, like Hanoi police's uniforms throughout history, police's activities throughout different periods, from wartime to peace... Another super-awesome feature is the museum staffs. They will show you around the museum and explain the meaning of the objects/ pictures to you - JUST ASK THEM as soon as you step inside. On that day, I went with other friends (in my club) and was particularly impressed by Mr.Cong, as he is very enthusiastic, open-minded and knowledgeable.The best of all is that the museum is totally free. no entrance fee needed means that you can save some of your travelling budget. The museum opens daily from 8 to 5. Check-in there if you want to know more about the history and development of Hanoi police and find the answer why Vietnam- such a small and seemingly powerless country could defeat powers in world. Overall, highly recommended!!!"

The museum is brand new with a light modern airy design.The morning I went there sadly there were no local police guides which was a shame as I know that previously trainee police have shown visitors round. Perhaps that was something that was done when the Museum first opened.I think the people who would be more fascinated by the museum are the Vietnamese history lovers who really want to know more about Vietnam and the society and history. There is a big focus on past police history. And for someone who loves Vietnam and Hanoi I would have liked additional detail and information. But then again too much information doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone so I think the balance is right. It is enough to wet one's appetite for finding out more information. Perhaps it would be good to also have an audio guide that can give more information for those who want to learn more.Overall, an excellent and fascinating half hour/short visit around and element of Vietnamese society which may not always be top of one's list. Great glimpse into the Vietnamese police authority which importantly helps keep Vietnam a safe destination.And its free."

The entire history of the police force has been showcased into 4 separate sections. From the formation days to the catching of spies during war time and current state where more effort has been put into catching drug lords, preventing counterfeit medicines, solving kidnapping cases and stopping cyber crimes. All exhibits are explained clearly in Vietnamese, English and French."

            "review": "Free and informative. I could not find this museum on most tourist maps of Hanoi. I came to know the existence of this museum while browsing through Trip advisor on attractions in Hanoi. As a Police Officer myself, I was keen to know how this museum differs from my Police museum in Singapore and what useful information it has in store for me. I took sometime to hunt for the museum. I asked few locals I met along the way but surprisingly the locals looked at me ignorantly and seem not to know the location of this museum. After a `thorough search' I managed to find the museum at 67 Ly Thuong Kiet and is strategically centered in an area with embassies and government buildings. Several uniformed Police protective unit officers stood on guard or patrolled outside the VIP premises. The museum is located within a building that resembled the British colonial architectural building of the Singapore Traffic Police Headquarters at Maxwell Road during those old days. The impressive 2-storey building of this museum in Hanoi appears well maintained and newly painted with erected signboard standing at the entrance displaying the opening hours of the museum from 8 am to 5 pm and admission is free. I was greeted with a welcome smile from the counter staff on duty. I introduced myself and the female staff was enthusiastic to show me around the museum. We started with a showroom of Vietnamese Police uniform since the early years and I found the new green and grey attire more in line with the civil defense forces of the world. Surprisingly, the fire and civil defense services fall under the jurisdiction of the Police Force. I later found out from the exhibition in the subsequent room that a lot of emphasis had been placed on `people protection' in the years of the Vietnam War during intense American bombardment. Civil Defense had since then evolved into an integral part of Police priorities and operations. I also observed that much credit were given to Intelligence Officers who worked undercover against CIA espionage and sabotage activities during the wartimes; against `counter-revolutionaries' and against infiltration by `subversive forces' sent by the `enemy forces'. Equal recognition were also awarded to the Protection Unit whose duties were to protect the main elite team members and officials of the revolutionary Communist Party from assassination and shootings. Whatever it is the past is the past. I found the great achievement of the modern Vietnamese Police Force in their ability to suppress crimes - drug proliferation, gang fight, cybercrime and crime syndicates and ensure that society is safe for the ordinary folk and the streets safe for tourists to visit the country. The museum also showcases many conventional equipment and modern instruments used by the Police during the old and modern days. The tour was informative. Before I left, the staff also presented me with few booklets of information on the museum and a tourist map of Hanoi. I really appreciate that courteous staff for such a warm welcome and her painstaking effort in explaining those exhibition material to me making my tour of the museum an informative and memorable one."

Now a new wind blows here: the police opens the doors to demonstrate where they were and are about. In two floors one gets an interesting overview on police history since 1945. The police played a role in the confrontation with the French and later the Americans. They do not hide this part of history. This modern museum also informs about the present tasks, including the fight against organized crime, drugs, and even cybercrime. On the ground floor one can find part of the collection, a meeting room with pictures of all commanders of the police force and a small shop. It is certainly worth a visit. One advise if you want to use the toilet; in Vietnam it is wise to carry some toilet paper to prevent possible unpleasant situations.."

This is a bonus as the cheery and knowledgeable guides help provide context to the exhibits and answer questions with a good level of English.Apparently the head of the police (\"Duc Chung\") had the idea of creating the museum having visited the Police Museum in Munich - this shows, as it comes across as the most, for want of a better word, \"westernised\" museums we've seen in Vietnam.

It also stands out on the street because its quite new and clean and almost entirely white. And don't forget, its free.What to expect:- An honest an blunt history of the police force- Accounts of individuals who made the force what it is today- A good look at wartime artefacts including fake documents, weaponry, small vehicles, clothing, and police equipment- Very friendly advice and information from the staff who are quite enthusiastic and speak fairly good EnglishIt should take quick museum goers about 45 minutes to do the whole thing but a keen learner might take up to 2 hours."

What a lovely small museum. Brand new so well laid out, cool and displayed in a way that is easy to follow the history of the force and how it shaped Hanoi. The member of staff stayed with us throughout explaining the exhibits and answering all my questions. Having just left the Ho Lao prison (it's just around the corner) this was actually a great place to visit as the stories are interconnected. The information about the French and CIA spies was very interesting as were some of the little side stories and the collection of knives, home made gun and other seized goods."

Lots of exhibits outlining the history of the police force in Vietnam. While there, many police officers were also taking the tour. Guides and staff were very friendly and helpful to explain the exhibits."

Also known as Hanoi PM or B\u00e5o T\u00e0ng C\u00f4ng An H\u00e0 N\u00f4i, on way to another museum when I happened upon this museum by chance, could not have been more impressed with the museum itself and I cannot recall ever being so well looked after by staff. It is not a big museum and suggest you make the time to enjoy this treasure, I am certain you will not regret it. Congratulations to all involved."

This is a brand new Museum in Hanoi and looks it - bright, clean and airy - where visitors are welcomed by at the door by cheerful, friendly and gracious staff who could communicate in English. A young keen Museum guide took us through the whole Museum for no charge. The Museum is well-laid out with exhibit captions clearly written in 3 languages- Vietnamese, English and French. The lay-out is by historical period, and a free small glossy leaflet brochure is available summarizing these periods and their key exhibits. Most of the exhibits are on the second floor, accessed by stairs, with the ground (1st) floor mainly give over to a display area, and guest lounge and a small museum shop. The highlight for me was the exhibits detailing the 1945 - 1954 historical period - the beginning of the police force. There was information there I have never come across before, such as the \"metal bowls\" group (12 to 16 year olds, acting like Baker Street Irregulars for fans of Sherlock Holmes) and the A13 Team. Absolutely fascinating!"

A great place to go with the family or on your own, kids can dress up as policemen an police women, there is also lots to see for them. On the other hand it is also very interesting, especially because all text is in English, French and Vietnamese. The lady who give me the tour spoke good English and did her up most best to keep telling me interesting new facts. It does give you a deeper insight of what the police has done in history and its current position in society. And they have great buttons for the kids. Worth visiting."

It gives a lot of information about the role of the police force through the various wars,which is of course, a little one sided but still informative. The building is designed in such a way that you are incouraged to follow the rooms in order, which works well with exhibits that are arraged by time period. If you like the police or interested in the society of hanoi from 1945 to the present day then this is a must but for the rest us, this is a nice museum to pop in to if you happen to be near by."

The staff actually did a guided tour for us, glad to practice their English, and they certainly had a good knowledge of what was on view. We were the only visitors at the time. I particularly found the documents signed by Ho Chi Minh on show to be good to see, and photographs of the city during the Vietnam War when residents were evacuated. This would be great for a rainy day if you have children as it has enough to keep them interested, with everything from guns to police vehicles."

It was free during our visit & the tour guide was free too. His name was Cong and he was very accommodating. He speaks english. I am not sure though if the visits to this museum will remain free. The museum still smells new during our visit so I'm thinking the free visit was a sort of \"opening deal\". We were even given a free pin as a souvenir. The other staffs were friendly too. We enjoyed the picture-taking with them."

It is better laid out and has better lighting than most other Hanoi museums and have a good range of materials. Stepping into the museum, we were welcomed by the friendly staff who gave us little badges as souvenirs. The museum covers the history of the Hanoi police force and Vietnamese police force from the early 20th century. we spent about an hour and a half looking at exhibits. The museum shop has fun little key rings and coasters which are good for gifts. Entrance is free."

A history of the Hanoi police from the the end of colonialism to the present day. There are heroes and villains and the same human interest stories - police delivering babies - popular everywhere.There is lots of information in Vietnamese, English and French and the commentary gives and interesting view on the struggle for independence and the meaning of law and order in a communist state.Not a destination museum, but look in if you are in the area. It's in the French District a stones throw from the prison museum and you can cool down with the air con while getting this extra view of the justice system."
