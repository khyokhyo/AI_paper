For an introduction to art the Frick combines a wonderful collection of masterpieces with the experience of a home, in which people lived and enjoyed the art on the walls. It makes the experience more personal and for those with relatively short attention spans keeps the museum tour to an hour or two. Kids like to move about the rooms, knowing someone lived in that sort of splendor."

Not the broadest collection of European art but a stunning selection of paintings by some of the world's greatest European painters (Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Boucher, David, Degas, Vermeer, Goya). You're in someone's mansion, not a museum, so you'll find smaller rooms with decorative art and period furnishings to complement the paintings. You won't be sorry you visited."

Having visited many cities and the art galleries, this one is a breathe of fresh air. A small but well put together collection of art from around the world with thoughtful commentaries available from audio guides included in the entry fee. Beautiful rooms, with paintings often from only one or two artists (like Gainsborough or Whistler) help you appreciate how a collector would arrange works of art in his own room. Unfortunately, on finding out how Frick made his money, for me some of the gloss comes off the home and the collection!"

I love the Frick because it is small but nevertheless has an extraordinary collection of paintings, furniture and ceramics. They are set out as though they were a personal collection representing that person's individual choice - which of course is exactly what it is. I have been lucky in my visits over the years as it has never been crowded; I can imagine this could be a problem. For this reason I would avoid the times when they have a cheap entrance fee option. For UK visitors the portraits of Thomases More and Cromwell, the large collection of Gainsboroughs and the wonderful Constable painting of Salisbury Cathedral are of particular interest. Allow 3 to 4 hours."

For such a small museum you can find masterpieces and paintings so emblematic that I originally assumed they had to be in Europe. Among the jewels there is the a portrait of Oliver Cromwell by Hans Holbein the Younger, and perhaps the most representative pieces of the roccoco style by both Boucher and Fragonard. Its important to note that unlike most museums, no photography is allowed and there is no place to eat within the building."

The museum has a short movie worthy of your time to give a back story that will make you appreciate the collections even more and enhance your knowledge of how much he appreciated fine art and what his intention was upon building this magnificent structure.

I wish we had come during regular hours.We started out early in the \"free admission\" time, when the galleries had fewer than 7 to 10 people each in them. But within an hour the crowding was beginning to bother us. We loved debating what was happening in \"Symphony in Flesh Colour and Pink: Portrait of Mrs. Frances Leyland, 1871-74\" by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Why was she so close to the wall? Or was she? What about that magnificent gown (which looked quite like a dressing gown--so was she partially undressed?). Had they been lovers? We loved comparing her to the other Whistler portrait, \"Harmony in Pink and Grey: Portrait of Lady Meux.\" So there was time for contemplation. For a while.The giant Veroneses took me back to Venice, and one of the most wonderful things about them is that you can see them \"up close and personal.\" If you love color, don't miss the master's \"Wisdom and Strength\" and \"The Choice Between Virtue and Vice.\" Simply breathtaking. I could have looked at them all day.The interior pond, flanked by a most modern guardian angel, became crowded quickly. Several people at once vied to take pictures of the frog fountain. People were closing in on our reveries. It started to feel like the subway, handbags bumping us and people cutting in front of each other. Soon we each reported having a headache. It was time to go.The gift shop was mobbed. It was almost impossible to get the attention of staff, and one clerk, clearly full of himself, was downright rude to my friend. There is no necessity for that. Yes, it's crowded, but if you can't handle your job, please quit. I think Mr. Frick would have fired him immediately. While there is no restaurant, Cafe Laduree is around the corner on Madison, for good coffee and pastry. Apparently the powers that be at the Museum plan to dig up the lily pond and garden to the East of the home--a true place of silent repose--to build over them with offices and a cafe. But they plan no additional gallery space. This is a deplorable plan. I think Mr. Frick would roll over in his grave. The Museum has done quite well without these things for decades. This garden and its pond are composing, one of the few places left in New York where you can truly find peace. (Shaking my head.) Do try to see it while it's still there. Free, to the right of the entrance."

The grandeur, opulence and detail is unparalleled and the experience left me feeling happy and rich in knowledge for Mr. Frick and NY society in the early 1900's. History and art buffs alike will appreciate this sophisticated collection. The navigation through the collection was easy, and the audio guide was great in providing explanation for the paintings, furniture, sculptures, and other pieces scattered throughout. As others have mentioned, this is not a place for young children, and don't expect the Met or MoMA size-wise.

            "review": "A Can't Miss Gem. I have been a member of The Frick Collection for a number of years. No other museum on New York gives so much instant satisfaction as The Frick, or can so reliably amaze a visiting friend. I suppose you could say it's a small museum, occupying Mr. Frick's mansion on perhaps the most valuable stretch of real estate in New York. But the collection is anything but small. It is the densest assemblage of masterpieces under one roof excepting perhaps the Courtauld in London. If you're after modern art, The Frick is not for you, and \"modern\" includes the Impressionists. There are minor paintings by Monet, Manet, and Degas, but they are an afterthought. You come to The Frick to see \"Old Masters\" and there are so many great paintings it's hard to describe all the highlights.The paintings and sculpture are displayed in fabulous rooms where Frick and his family once lived. In the first main room you come to, the Living Hall, there are two Holbeins, one of them the famous painting of Thomas More, staring warily across the fireplace at his nemesis, Thomas Cromwell. There is tremendous drama created by having these two Holbeins together in one room, 500 years after the events of Wolf Hall. Two Titians on the other wall show the master at his best: they are very different portraits but each overflows with its own emotion. Romance in the Portrait of a Young Man Wearing a Red Hat and power in the burly form of Pietro Aretino. Titian getting started and Titian as master of the art world: almost as dramatic a juxtaposition as the two Holbeins.But the star of the room is the magnificently preserved St. Francis in the Desert by Giovanni Bellini. An observer could devote an entire visit to just this painting, and indeed, there is a large book devoted to it for sale in the bookstore. It's so full of details, drama, and religious fervor, but without looking like a 15th century religious painting. The look on Francis' face as he receives the stigmata is one of complete bafflement, what a real person must have felt in the circumstances. There is a donkey standing nearby, looking very real and oblivious. The plants growing in the rocks, his sandals, and even the string doorbell are rendered with a naturalism that could be 19th Century. But Bellini painted this in the 1470s. Before DaVinci, before Michaelangelo, before the true High Renaissance. This truly is one of the world's great masterpieces. You'll have to rip yourself away so you can get to the main room.Here you will be overwhelmed as you look down the West Gallery and see highlights every 3 or 4 steps. Everything here is worth spending time with. Rembrandts including The Polish Rider. Hals, Velasquez, El Greco, Goya, Claude Lorraine, a magnificent pair of Van Dyck portraits of Frans Snyders and his wife, magnificent Turners on opposite walls. And at the end of the gallery, framing the door to the pre-Renaissance collection, two unforgettable and enormous mythological scenes by Veronese. Once in the collection of Rudolph II, these are unquestionable Veronese masterpieces, and with a partner painting just up the road at the Met, you can see Veronese at his best in three canvases.The far room - the Enamels Room - has Pieros, a Duccio, and even a Cimabue - the only one in New York that I know of. It's a small quiet room stuffed with very religious - looking paintings, all of the first quality. And JP Morgan's priceless collection of Limoges enamels.There's a room of ravishing British paintings, a Gilbert Stuart George Washington, one of Ingres' greatest paintings, a charming room of Boucher childrens' panels, a room of Fragonards, a perfect Bronzino: it goes on and on. When you need a rest, the Garden Court may be the most luxurious place to sit in all New York.What have I forgotten? Well, there was something else i should have mentioned, but with so much to see at every turn you'll need to come back to truly take it all in.Advice: Get the headphones and take the tour. There are no descriptions of the paintings on the walls, as there are in most museums. And buy a book to keep with you. You'll be glad you have it later as the Frick does not publish its pictures widely. If there is a restaurant there I am unaware of it and affordable lunch won't be easy in nearby streets, as you are now in the poodle district. Fortunately, Central Park is right across the street. Get a hot dog. All your senses will be glowing from the visit back to another era, when rich people were really rich and further back, when artists were truly Masters. The hot dog will taste delicious."

There are also Titians, Goya, el Greco, Constable, Turner, Gainsborough, Degas, Monet and Vermeer, But we really love Dieppe Harbor by Turner. There are also excellent collections of sculpture, Limoges enamels and porcelains.

There are iconic images of Cromwell and Sir Thomas More by Holbein, 2 very powerful portraits by Titian and arguably Rembrandt's finest self portrait. But for me the star of the show is the huge painting of Dieppe Harbour by Turner. It is simply awe inspiring. The art is displayed to show each piece to best effect. Set in harmony with fine furniture, sculptures and porcelain within elegantly designed rooms, the collection must surely be one of the most sumptuous in the world. Forget the pretentious splodges of paint at MOMA. This is proper art. There is creative vision in the compositions and technical skill of the very highest level in order to bring that vision to life. And I do mean life. The artists represented here don't just paint what they see, they paint what they feel. Such is the artistry, that in viewing these pictures we then sense the very soul of the sitter. And as for Turner's \"Dieppe Harbour\" - just WOW! There is more vision, creative genius and technical accomplishment in this one painting than in all the works in MOMA. "

Nestled in what feels like suburban Manhattan (if there is such a thing) and shadowed by central park, the Frick collection offers a peace and tranquility which was thought to be an alien concept in New York City. Meandering around the collection it has the air of viewing a late Victorian plantation house rather than a museum. This collection is for art lovers rather than the casual follower with mesmeric pieces by the great masters. Quality over quantity. Recommended."

It is a small but remarkable collection displayed in an unusual way in the Frick mansion on Fifth Avenue. I don't know that I've seen art displayed in such a personal way, and it is a fabulous collection. The works of Vermeer, Rembrandt, Holbein, El Greco, Renoir, etc., were stunning. The interiors are also beautiful in their own right, and showcase the art. The room with the El Greco, Holbein, and Titian paintings may have been one of the most beautiful rooms I've seen. It was not especially crowded, and the audio guide included in the US$22 ticket was a nice resource to have. The film on H.C. Frick was also good for background. After the Met, I'd put this at the top of the 'must see' museums."

It's not a huge place, and as museums go, it's different. Because unlike the Metropolitan, the huge museum just up 5th Avenue from the Frick, it's really a house, but what a house! The Fricks were super-collectors, and the house has been preserved much like they had it--their taste, and their treasures. H. C. Frick was a Pittsburgh industrialist, and he built this \"Gilded Age\" mansion at 70th St. and 5th Ave. to house his collection of paintings, sculptures, and bric a brac before he died--with his own plan to leave it for all to see. Yes, it was more than just a grand house, and was built with galleries for the family art collection, and what a collection it is: Rembrandt, Vermeer, El Greco--almost every big name in Gilded Age collecting. But the real appeal of a visit is to imagine living in such a place. Overall, the impression is light, intimate, and the rooms in the living quarters are highly decorated with art in the styles favored by the Frick's. I came away with an impression of lightness, delicacy, shown so clearly in the Boucher room. Obviously, Mr. Frick was a big fan of Francois Boucher, and that room is filled with not just wall paintings, but furniture, bronzes, and porcelains by Boucher, the French master of the Rococo. You can walk through and imagine how it must have been to live among these things, since these are the rooms where the Fricks lived and entertained. His vision of planning has given us a perfect example of a high-taste lifestyle during the Gilded Age---the architecture, the collection and even the furniture, rugs, china, and the rest. It's truly like going back in time, and my God, what a time!!"

His collections of all sorts of art are likely without equal among private American citizens, and his daughter continued to add more stuff after his death. So even though his collections are not really to my taste, I have got to say that this site is excellent for the house itself and the breadth of what is on display inside."

In addition to a huge display of oils, the collection includes sculpture, Limoges enamels and porcelains.As I left, I felt I was suffering from sensory overload. So much great artwork, so much to absorb, so little time.The collection is almost entirely of European provenance, with but two 19th-century American artists represented (including Whistler).

It's an incredibly worthwhile visit - just enough to satisfy, especially with the audio guide included in your admission. Sundays are Pay What You Wish from 10am-1pm so come early (though the line moves relatively quickly, at least for us). But for an art lover (or even someone who wouldn't consider themselves as such, but has a curiosity), the general admission price is well worth it. The Met is huge and takes several visits to really digest and so while the major museums of the world are fantastic to visit, there is something delightful about visiting a robust and richly decorated space filled with many notable works that can be adequately visited in a few hours. That being said, the Frick is the kind of place you could visit several times over and continue to focus on different pieces in deeper ways, discovering new little quirks and favorite pieces (or just visiting the rotating special exhibits).

The Frick is a collection based on the collecting of a millionaire railroad entrepreneur named Henry Clay Frick. The permanent collection is superb, but one of the things that makes this museum a must-visit in NYC is its special exhibitions, which are superbly curated, balancing just the right number of art objects with just the right amount of explanatory text labels and catalogues. This is a memorable museum in every way."

I should have been visiting whenever there was a show of interest to me, because this is the kind of place where you can calm down and really focus on the art. And I'm no egghead, but I love to see art that I have come to know through reading or magazines, or art history classes back in the day at college. The bigger museums are sometimes to hectic-feeling, that it's hard to relax and enjoy. Not so, here at The Frick. There are many quiet spaces, and you'll feel as if you're actually visiting some very rich friend, who just happens to own a billion dollars worth of great art! This is a great place, and right off Fifth Avenue, so great before/after a stroll in Central Park."

The Veronese paintings - allegories featuring Hercules hold pride of place by the main doors in the principal viewing room. I love the Venetian school and these two are also my favorites but they are joined by Turners, a Velazquez and other masters. Moreover, the building itself abutting Central Park on 70th street is a Gilded Age palace. The central courtyard, the only place you can photograph is a beautiful space and a statement of late nineteenth century opulence. These are other paintings throughout the building. I was able to view a series of paintings focusing on 18th century military life by Watteau which was very interesting. Don't miss the Frick when in New York City."

I kept imagining what it must have been like to get up each morning and take a cup of coffee and enjoy a Vermeer or Van Dyke! The informative video in the music room was very helpful as were the audioguides as neither of us are art experts. The women in the gift shop where also helpful in giving us ideas for a yummy lunch at the cafe in the nearby Asia museum.

There are works by Monet, Rembrandt, Turner, Whistler, and Degas, and the famous painting of St. Thomas More by Holbein. Almost everything in the collection is before the 20th Century. There is also a collection of porcelain, some pre-Renaissance church artwork, some sculptures and ornamental clocks.The artwork is all of very high quality, although there is not a lot of variety - most of the paintings are portraits or serene landscapes and cityscapes. The collection is not that large, so you can see it all in a few hours."

And I have not even mentioned the exquisite pieces of art works. the Chinese porcelains depicting the interpretation of beauty of the time somewhat resonated tru out the museum. Goya,Van Dyke, Turner, Constable, Monet, Manet gathered in this mansion over looking Central Park.What is truly amazing is the viewer connection with these arts. Many are not enclosed by a show case. They lay bare for my eyes to enjoy, without any intermediary. Its rare to experience such joy. The moment when art, a true pure expression of beauty and a peasant like me meet. Exquisite. Say a prayer to the Fricks for their gift of making these stunning mansion and its content accessible. Inspiring for years to come."

The museum features romantic and impressionist paintings as well as some amazing sculptures and time pieces. Claude Lorrain's Sermon on the Mount and Gilbert Stuart's Portrait of George Washington are definite highlights. The real unique feature of this museum, however, is the house and the architecture.

So, if you are on a budget while visiting NYC you can enjoy the beautiful home and art at a great price. An audio guide will provide you with background of the owner, the home and art. Allow yourself about 3 hours if you want to listen to most of the audio guide. After visiting 3 other museums, the Frick Collection was my favorite."

The Hans Holbein portraits of Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell are particular favorites of mine--glaring at each other across the fireplace in the Living Hall, as is Mistress and Maid by Vermeer (of which a character in a favorite film once said, \"There's more painting going on in this corner than all of Soho combined.\"The collection is not overwhelming in the manner of the Met, and is invariably calm and quiet.

They were produced during one of the darkest chapters of France\u2019s history, the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u201314), but the martial glory on which most military painters trained their gaze held no interest for Watteau.

The individual rooms contain furnishings from China, France, Italy and elsewhere -- all of which only enhance the beauty of the masterpieces on the walls.

The Frick Collection presents a wonderful video that introduces Mr. Henry Clay Frick the collector and industrialist, and how his magnificent collection came to be. Highly recommend that you watch this video before you tour the museum, just to give a perspective and a greater appreciation for the art. Stunning masterpieces that are presented in a much more intimate way in the setting of a private home, rather than laid out in typical museum fashion (genres, schools of art, etc.) Note: no children under ten are allowed and Sunday mornings from 11-1 allow 'Pay as you wish' admission, so it is naturally much busier at this time."

One of the best features was the audio recordings that described not only the piece of art, but how and why it was collected, or where it was placed in the house originally. The stories were fascinating and then add in the stunning paintings by Rembrandt, Monet, Manet, Constable, Turner, etc., I prefer the impressionists, but was still in awe over the beauty and size of the Dutch painters and others. Also, the size of the building is a bit more achievable in an afternoon compared to the Met."

Over the years Frick collected hundred of pieces from the medieval era, Baroque era, Rococo era, and Neoclassical era. In his will he left it to the city of New York and eventually after his widow passed, it was converted into the museum it currently is. When walking through The Frick, you view the pieces in each room of the Frick household as it was when they lived there. The architecture of the rooms is very much in the Victorian era and you go back in time while walking through. While I was there, there was a very small porcelain special exhibit. It was nice but very small and not a reason to go visit the museum, unless you are very into porcelain. There is a GORGEOUS garden area with a fountain in the middle. It's really peaceful and a lovely spot to just sit back and relax a bit. Insider tip: there are outlets right below the benches if you need to charge your phone. This is also the only area in the museum where you can take pictures. This is a pricer museum but they do have senior and student prices. It's worth coming to once when in NYC."

Some of the larger museums can be daunting but you can see the entire Frick Collection in an hour-two hours. Looking at art in the setting of a home vs an institution such as a large museum is an experience you should not miss.Tip: there are only 34 known paintings by Johannes Vermeer and the Frick Collection has three. If you cross the street and walk up to the Met you can see 4 more. That is 7 of all the Vermeers' in the entire world in an 11 block section of fifth avenue!"

It gives you a glimpse into life at the top of the pile in those days, but the art is the real wow factor.It's clear that the collection was a deeply personal one, and one can only imagine the deep meaning that each work carried for the family.What I love is that this gallery is \"just enough\" - not like some others where the art is overpowering.

There is an app for your iPhone or an audible guided tour was given to you as you walk through this beautiful home. Plan for at least three plus hours. You can take a break across the street at Central Park. Re entry during the same day is permitted. There are kiosk locations for lunch or a snack just outside the park. Bathrooms and a gift shop are also available in the Frick museum. There are three beautiful gardens. One is located in the center of the museum. A theater location provides times through out the day providing information and history of the Frick museum. Staff also provides group guided tours periodically."

Being a frugal traveller, I try to avoid museum fees first time around if possible, until I know it's worth it. Many museums/galleries in New York City offer 'pay-as-you-wish' times and The Frick's is every Sunday from 11am-1pm. When I arrived at 12.30pm on a rainy Sunday in May, the line was already wrapped around the building and I was worried I'd miss out, but, thankfully, I made it with five minutes to spare. Once you're in, you can stay until closing and I nearly did. This is an absolutely amazing personal collection amassed by a man who had excellent and eclectic taste. He even purpose-built the house knowing it was going to be a museum after his death. Strict 'no photography' rules apply.TIP: if you download the free Frick Collection App, you can use their free WIFI to navigate and listen to the audio tour.The Frick Collection is worth the full fee and I very highly recommend this attraction in NYC!"

Before visiting The Frick, a reading of Henry Clay Frick's biography is helpful in understanding this complicated man. Both revered for this collection of fine and rare art and reviled for his business tactics, the contradiction is striking when considering the gift of the The Frick Collection by Henry Clay Frick.We were lucky to visit during the Van Dyck Exhibition and view the sketches and paintings of Van Dyck in the lower level, including self portraits, and we enjoyed a guided tour of the Van Dyck Exhibition. Afterward, we were inspired by the vast works of fine art collected by Henry Clay Frick, including Monet, Renoir, Vermeer and many others.Check the website for special events you may be able to attend or events causing the closing of the museum. On Sundays, there is a period to enter in the early afternoon at no cost. On the Sunday I checked, the Frick was closed and not to reopen until Tuesday. Fortunately, our schedule allowed the Tuesday visit and we enjoyed an educational, instructional weekday visit. Several of the paintings were on loan from other museums. Photography was allowed only in the garden court and photography was not allowed in any of the other rooms or galleries. Photos of the garden court fountains, sculptures and tulips in the outside gardens captured a memory of this extraordinary collection. Very highly recommended."

            "review": "Very Interesting Private Art Museum. The art collection of Henry Clay Frick is exhibited in a residential setting amid the furnishings of his opulent mansion, which provides a glimpse of how the extremely wealthy lived in New York's golden age. It is an exceptional group of painting and sculptures from the Renaissance to the early 20th century. Frick died in 1919 and his daughter converted the home as it was always intended to a museum in the 1930\"s. It features Manets, Monets, El Grecos, Goyas, Van Dykes, Turners, and at least one Rembrandt self-portrait. I confused Holbein's famous portrait of Sir Thomas More with similar portrait of Erasmus. Frick himself was (nearly) as interesting as his museum. Frick (1849 \u20131919) was an American industrialist, financier, union-buster, and art patron. He founded the H. C. Frick & Company coke manufacturing company, was chairman of the Carnegie Steel Company, and played a major role in the formation of the U.S. Steel Co. He also financed the construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad and Reading Co. and owned extensive real estate holdings in Pittsburgh and throughout Pennsylvania. We remember him from the PBS TV special.In 1871 Frick, invested family money to acquire low-priced coking fields and build fifty coke ovens. Within a decade, H. C. Frick Coke Company would operate some thousand working ovens and produce eighty percent of the coke used by Pittsburgh's burgeoning iron and steel industries. Shortly after marrying Adelaide Howard Childs, in 1881, Frick met Andrew Carnegie in NYC while the Fricks were on their honeymoon. This lead to a partnership between H. C. Frick & Company and Carnegie Steel Company, the predecessor to U.S. Steel Co. This partnership ensured that Carnegie's steel mills had adequate supplies of coke. Frick became chairman of the company. Carnegie made multiple attempts to force Frick out of the company they had created by making it appear that the company had nowhere left to go and that it was time for Frick to retire. Despite the contributions Frick had made towards Andrew Carnegie's fortune, Carnegie disregarded him in many executive decisions including finances. He was a lifelong opponent of organized labor, and his refusal to allow union workers at his mines led to the infamous Homestead strike of July 1892, in which ten men were killed and sixty wounded. The same month, Frick himself was attacked in a failed assassination attempt by a twenty-five-year-old Russian anarchist. He cabled both his mother and Carnegie: \"Was twice shot, but not dangerously.\"Frick had started to collect paintings seriously in his late forties and began to focus on his collections even more after his move to New York in 1905. In 1913, construction began on Henry Frick's New York mansion on Fifth Avenue costing nearly $5,000,000, including land. Frick died in 1919. In his will, he left the house and all of the works of art in it together with the furnishings (\"subject to occupancy by Mrs. Frick during her lifetime\") to become a gallery called The Frick Collection. He provided an endowment of $15 million to be used for the maintenance of the Collection and for improvements and additions. "

You get two attractions in one in this mansion turned museum... all a methodical plan by industrialist Henry Clay Frick who had an incredible passion for collecting fine art. Considering some of the masterpieces that you'll see, not to mention the architecture, it's well worth the $20 entry fee. Take advantage of the headset tour (part of the admission price) and plan on spending at least 2 hours here. I recommend that you start by viewing the film that covers Frick's life and how he came to amass this great collection. Make a day of it and wander over to Central Park when you're done or beforehand. The entrance near 70th Street is one of the more interesting areas of Central Park including the boathouse where you can have a casual lunch or cocktails outside or in."

It's a real gem of a gallery and whilst less well known than other NY galleries it was my favourite by far.Housed in what was Henry Clay Frick's home, built especially for his art collection this beautiful Victorian mansion is lovely in its own right, but with the collection of masterpieces it really is amazing. Expect to see works by great artists such as Van Dyck, Titian, Holbein, Gainsborough, Hogarth and Vermeer.. the Hans Holbein portraits of Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell glaring at each other across the fireplace were beautifully placed and a real privilege to see. As a Tudor history geek I felt a little emotional by them! As well as paintings there are vases, bronzes and porcelain to see. All beautiful and well curated. Make sure you get the free audio guide, which whilst a little flowery sometimes are very informative and as there are not info signs on all paintings is invaluable.Staff weren't as cheerful or helpful as in other places I have visited, they were efficient in managing the queues, if a little abrupt and noone directed us to the audioguide, we had to find them ourselves when we noticed other people using them. Don't let that put you off though, it's still very much worth seeing. We arrived just before opening at 11am on the Sunday and there was already quite a queue, and as there is limited space we noticed a few people waiting outside when we left for people to leave before they were allowed in. Again, if you have to queue it's worth the wait!"

(Frick was a Pittsburgh industrialist in the coke and steel industries and a partner of Andrew Carnegie.) As a result, the collection is both the personal gatherings and furnishings of Mr. Frick as displayed in the public areas of his home and later acquisitions and physical renovations that followed the conversion from home to museum.this is a rather intimate personal art collection and certainly not on the scale of a major museum like the Metropolitan Museum. But, it does showcase the wide range of art interests of Mr. Frick. It is a very worthwhile visit."

The house is magnificent and takes up a whole block opposite Central Park. This used to be Frick's home and you can still get the feeling of it having been one. The layout, organisation and information is outstanding but this is nothing to the pictures, sculptures and porcelain. The history is amazing and the indoor garden must be seen to be believed. I'm not into art as a rule but I would revisit this magnificent museum time and again. Brilliant."

I owe a big \"Thank You\" to the TripAdvisor contributor who warned that the Guggenheim rotunda was closed when we planned to visit & that it would be better to go to visit the Frick Collection instead. That turned out to be fantastic advice! Our group of four adults loved everything about this museum including: the beautiful mansion that would be worth seeing even if it were empty, the impressive art collection & furniture attractively displayed in every room, the relaxed/uncrowded atmosphere (we went on a Friday afternoon after a morning walk around Central Park), the manageable size of the museum (you can see it all in a couple of hours), the lack of crying/bored children (children under ten are not permitted in the museum), the free coat check (note: no beverages/water bottles or photography allowed in the museum - leave all your stuff at the coat check), and the tasteful selection of items in the gift shop including unique items such as scarves & mugs inspired by artwork in the collection. There is also a special exhibition of artwork by Van Dyck that is worth seeing. I highly recommend The Frick to anyone who loves artwork, old homes and/or architecture. Make sure you pick up the audio tour to get the most out of your visit."

If you travel to NY looking for an opportunity to enjoy it's considerable art scene you are probably more familiar with the big museums and galleries such as The Metropolitan, MoMa or the Guggenheim and understandably so. They are fabulous institutions, absolute Titans of the art world although the first two are in a different league.The Frick is more modest in size occupying as it does one of the few remaining mansions from the so called gilded age in mid town Manhattan built by its namesake Clayton Frick. This collection packs an unbelievable punch as it displays the fabulous collection of classical works including Vermeer, Goya, Rembrandt and all set in the mid 19th century opulence of an industrialists mansion. When the thought of two days at one of the great galleries seems too daunting, take the morning and go to The Frick but whatever you do don't consider it a compromise of time or quality - it's neither and while art is so deeply personal it belongs in NY's top three."

Instead, it is a collection of some of the most wonderful art in the world from Rembrandt to Gainsborough to dozens of others, every piece is a masterpiece.In addition to the paintings, the museum displays numerous statues and lots of wonderful furnishings.

And then there are the special exhibits. We saw Vermeer's \"The Girl with the Pearl Earring\" a few years ago. We were alone with the painting for about 5 minutes before other people came over. That was an amazing experience. And the Turners and Rembrandts and the Manet and Renoir and .... on and on. We also love the relaxing areas where you can just sit and .... relax. It's a must-visit for anyone who loves art. Oh - there are also clocks and sculptures and other stuff but mostly I don't know what I'm looking at. Even so, they're also amazing."

The building itself, completed in 1914, speaks of what the area around Central Park would have been like before they tore down beautiful mansions and replaced them with faceless apartment buildings. So go for the priceless art collection, but also go for a glimpse of old New York."

The collection is eclectic in artistic periods and styles but the subject matter is principally portraits and landscapes. Do not miss the opportunity to examine the objets d'art, furniture and book collections, too.We were also pleasantly surprised by the pay what you want Sunday admission policy between 11am and 1pm."

Henry Frick bequeathed his home and art collection so the public would always have access, and after the death of his wife, it opened to the public in 1935. Much of the furniture is in place and the art is hung as it would have been in the home, eye level and without barriers. It\u2019s wonderful and intimate; a very relaxing way to enjoy such beautiful old masters."

It is definitely worth a visit and close to the Met and Guggenheim if you're planning your day. The house is from an era that no longer exists so it is interesting to see how people lived at the high end in that era! The only complaint is that they disallow photo taking completely except in the center garden area. Really, it would not be injurious to the house to allow non-flash photos, so we didn't not agree with this policy. Otherwise, it was fascinating and a worthwhile stop."

            "review": "Great Art in a Beautiful Mansion. I first went to the Frick Collection 55 years ago as a young man and have continued to love the collection over the years. The Frick was collected primarily by Mr Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919), one of America's richest entrepreneurs. After his wife died in 1931, the mansion was altered and enhanced to become the museum of today. The mansion has many treasures in the arts including superb paintings by the world's best artists as well as many sculptures, clocks, furniture and various oriental vases. But it is the art where Frick holds the true classics. For example, on the north wall of the West Gallery, there are three Rembrandts, two Franz Hals, a Velasquez, a Turner and a Vermeer. All of these paintings are superb. In the Living Hall, there is a superb El Greco of St. Jerome. Next to it is a wonderful Hans Holbein the Younger of Sir Thomas More. Opposite is a superb Bellini of St Francis and, incidentally, to each side is a Titian! Then, there is another El Greco in a smaller room and two Vermeer's in a hallway. There are probably less than 30 of Vermeer's paintings in the world today. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has at least five, probably the most in the world. The Frick has three! There are also other interesting paintings including a Bronzini with a man wearing a codpiece, lots of portraits by van Dyck, Gainborough and others, and a wonderful indoor garden within the house. In the old days, the Frick was free. Now it costs $20 for an adult (only $15 for us senior citizens and only $10 for students). This is still a reasonable amount for one of the world's most enjoyable art museum experiences and a must for those interested in the arts."

If ever there was a true scoundrel with impeccable taste in art and elegance, and an appreciation of the best of the old Masters, it was Henry Clay Frick. The epitome of the robber baron, friend and business partner to the great industrialists and bankers, heartless employer, heartless speculator, HCF was very much a man of his era. His tastes were classical, unadventurous, and opulent but, he managed his art collection as he did his business interests, prudently and slyly, counting on the classical \"blue chips\" to make his name. A fantastic El Greco of Saint Jerome with the saint's elongated fingers on the Bible stops the visitor's eye as do the Vermeers. The palace on Fifth Avenue proposes a serious, sometimes even solemn visit, the type one thinks it's one's duty to make but it is well worth it and it blends into the eclectic architectural melange on Manhattan's Museum Mile,"

We made sure to visit it today and it was incredible, one of the best art museums ever visited either in the U.S. or Europe. It is easy to get to and very inviting once you walk in the doors. The staff from entry to exit was very helpful and genuinely seemed to enjoy working there. The collection is superb, every piece, even those not on the audio guide is first rate and presented in a very inviting manner. The building itself is breathtaking, you really get a feel for the Frick and his age. I had read a biography about him before the visit and like all preparation for a visit it helped me understand the man and appreciate the collection. We arrived shortly after opening at 10:00 and thought we would be finished by lunch. Wrong we broke for lunch (they do not have a cafe or snack bar but there are a number of excellent places with various price ranges to eat nearby and we came back after lunch and did not leave until after 4:00. The ticket is good for the entire day so re-admission was free. Bottom line: you need to visit here for an incredible art museum experience."

He was a visionary (building his home with the intention that it would someday become a museum)! Lucky for us.If you can, consider seeing the 12 min. \"Introduction to the Frick Collection\" video in the Music Room or online at the Frick Museum website before touring the house to learn history about Mr. Frick as well as the house.

As we moved through the collection, we felt as if we were in someone's home, looking at their private art. It was a wonderful experience. The collection offers paintings, sculpture, furniture, enamels, and rugs, all accessible and arranged by room. It took us several hours to do a preliminary visit, and we could have spent a much longer time there. We will definitely go back for another look the next time we are in NYC. Please note that children under 10 are not allowed into the Collection, due to the ready and close access visitors have to the art objects. The Frick is a gem."

There are many works from very famous European artists and they had a special exhibition of works by Van Dyck. Highly recommend a visit to this museum.

Labelling is minimal (as befitting a residence) but there is a free audio tour included in the entry price or a Frick app if you have a smartphone. Probably as well we didn't take the audio tour as we would have spent all day there. A bonus was the special exhibition of Van Dyke paintings, drawings etc - the most comprehensive assembled anywhere in the world.

This is my second trip to NYC and we went (4 girlfriends) to the Frick on Sunday for the \"pay as you wish\" hours. When we arrived at 11 the line was to the end of the fence but once it opened it moved quickly and we were let inside within 5 minutes. You must coat check your coat here or wear it. No photography. When we left at 1:00 the line was double and they were only letting in what was coming out so I highly advise being there prior to 11 to be in line!We LOVED the collection. The house is beautiful, the audio tour (also free during this time) was awesome. Each painting has a number and you just press the number you're interested in hearing about and hit that. One thing to note which we thought was good info on the audio tour, is when you walk into a room there will be a number on a free standing stand. This tells you about the room, etc. Also I think #4 told you about Mr. Frick himself which we tried to find but didn't see much until we asked. I would listen to this first.Don't skip the statue of Diana at the end in a rotunda down the windowed hallway that overlooks Central Park. Something to note is this statue was made from terracotta and is all still in one piece. Amazing. (Down at the end of the Portico Gallery)Also, one thing to note is there is only one painting of his wife in the Boucher Room. It's on the desk and it's a watercolor of her.There are some gorgeous Vermeer's, Degas, tons of Van Dyck (downstairs as well), van Rijn, El Greco, etc.The collection is absolutely amazing in every room. I especially loved the Fragonard Room which had these large paintings called \"The Progress of Love\". Definitely listen to the audio on this one (the one for the room). Do not skip the Frick! I wish we had done our first round to NYC so my hubby could have seen it. This time was a girls trip. We will be returning.We started our day grabbing a bagel from \"Pick A Bagel\" just off the subway and then walked 3 blocks west to the Frick. Yummy breakfast beforehand.After we walked through Central Park and walked down to our broadway show which started at 3. We grabbed soup from The Soup Man and grilled cheese sandwiches since we needed something quick. All in all a perfect afternoon!"

When you don't want to be overwhelmed by a huge art museum and want to see a collection of incredible art by the different masters, this is the place to go. The collection is housed in a beautiful mansion and has an eclectic array of fine art hung with no particular theme in any one room. The antique furniture off sets this amazing collection. The museum was not crowded and gave the space to enjoy the art without hoards of people."

When I said to my daughter that it should not close before closing time, that security guard interrupted by starting to say \"who are you to decide that...\"; I walked away before she could finish of course.I was surprised - and very disappointed - at the Garden Court closing because when we were purchasing our tickets at FULL price nobody told us that we would only be getting partial value due to the Garden Court closing early.And given your institution's Mission (see your mission statement), which is all about the visiting public, why would you close to all visitors a central attraction in the Museum for the benefit of a select few (the private event attendees). I'm guessing they are \"important\" folks (donors perhaps?) who in the museum's eyes count more than the hundreds of visitors who were excluded from the Garden Court that day.Here are two suggestions. DO NOT close to the visiting public parts of the museum during regular hours for the purpose of private events. Schedule the private events and do whatever set up AFTER regular hours.If the museum must cater to the private event crowd over the visiting public, then at least instruct your museum staff to inform folks upon entering/paying that there may be some change to your regular offerings. For example, the person who sold us our tickets could have informed people coming in that the Garden Court was closing early and that we may wish to consider going there first so as not to miss it entirely (like we did). Then, discount the tickets because nobody should pay full price for anything less than the full experience.My daughter loves art, and still enjoyed her visit there. But I was SO disappointed I did not have a chance to have the moment with her in the Garden Court. I know I can come again, but I don't think I will - at least until I believe that the Frick is a place that considers all patrons important and not private event attendees more important, as evidenced by your museum's actions the day of our visit.Also, while visiting your gift shop, where my daughter made a purchase, I noticed that your two staff members in there only looked up from their smartphones when they had to process a transaction. No smiles, no greetings, only grunted minimal replies to questions.Hope you will consider the feedback because The Frick itself is a great place that can only be ruined by the actions and decisions of those working there, from top to bottom."

Henry Clay Frick was a controversial 19th century industrialist, but he used his fortune to build a home on Fifth Avenue in the early 20th century for an art collection that he wanted seen by the public in time. Every room is filled with incomparable treasures from Rembrandt (including his late and greatest self-portrait), Vermeer, Constable, Turner, Ingre, Franz Hals, Degas, Van Dyck, Holbein (his iconic portraits of Sir Thomas More and Sir Thomas Cromwell, George Romney, Renoir, Whistler, and so much more. Most of the original furnishing are in place along with sculpture, clocks, porcelain, and silver. This is my favorite art museum in New York--grand galleries, intimate rooms, and an indoor garden/fountain. Get the audio guide that is free with admission to learn all about the art. The museum is pay-what-you-wish on Sundays if you get there by 1 PM, but worth the $20 admission. Nice small gift shot, but no cafe. The Frick is all about the artwork. There is a film that runs all day in the Music Room providing history background on Mr. Frick and his collection. The special exhibitions (no extra charge) have been sensational in recent years."

The Frick Collection is a lovely museum on 70th off of Madison Ave. I went to view the Van Dyck exhibit which run through June 5 2016. The home of Henry Clay Frick lays out what you would expect from 1900s NYC mansion. Each room contains wonderful (mostly portraits) paintings Thomas Gainsborough, Jan Vermeer to name a few. I wasn't aware during this time there are paintings being loaned out, so a couple of paintings I wanted to see were not there. I'm particularly drawn to the day-to-day items vases, statues, dinnerware, porcelains. I love the craftsmanship of common objects during this period. The heart of the home (my opinion) is the enclosed courtyard, where you can sit and just enjoy the wonderful fountain. It's not a large museum, yet I spent 3 hrs there and was satisfied. Watch the film on the history and conversion of the Frick home into a museum (run continuously). Admission is $20, with pay-as-you want on SUNDAYS from 11-1pm. There is free street parking if you can find it, otherwise you can park on Madison but you have to feed meter every hr ($3.50 per hr). There are parking garages but I find them expensive (2 hrs $30-40). The museum allows you leave and come back, which is what I did. After your trip to the Frick Collection walk around the corner to Ladur\u00e9e, the french pastry shop (there will be a line) and enjoy a french macaroon. Central park entrance not far and end the day there. Enjoy."

He's not a painter I know very much about, but I learned a great deal from the exhibit's explanation of how his drawings and prints evolved into his portraits. He became the model for British portrait painters such as Gainsborough to later follow. The Frick does not have a lot of room for larger exhibits, so you need to begin in the basement. Space used for the exhibit also necessitates some of the regular collection having to be removed from view.The Frick mansion itself is a showplace. Since the Old Master paintings are so fabulous, don't neglect listening to the audio commentary for the individual rooms. The Living Room in particular is probably one of the greatest single rooms in the world because of the paintings it contains--Holbeins' s Sir Thomas More, Bellini's St. Francis, and two Titians. (A slight negative is that the museum's sculpture collection is not especially noteworthy.)The Frick also has a Velasquez, a few Rembrandts, the only Piero Della Francesca works in America, and three Vermeers. In addition, the Venetian palazzo with a water pond in the center of the building is not to be missed. If Old Master paintings in an old world setting are your cup of tea, then the Frick should be at the top of your list of things to see in New York City."

Housed in a Fifth Avenue mansion built and furnished by a steel baron, the Frick Collection is not just a stunning array of Old Master works, but the fully-furnished rooms themselves. You should start with the movie which recounts a bit about Frick and how he got started collecting. It's interesting and informative. No need to start at the beginning; just start watching at any point and loop 'round.The mansion interior is just awesome, possibly the best remaining example of how the ultra-rich lived during the Gilded Age. The art is impressive and covers a lot of ground (it's a BIG mansion): Rembrandt, Constable, Reynolds, Lawrence, Fragonard, Turner, Holbein, others.But I have two complaints. First, photography isn't permitted (whereas just about everywhere else in Manhattan it is), which I have always maintained is just unthinking mean-ness, since your handheld snapshots aren't going to deprive it of any income. (For some reason, photos are permitted in the large covered garden, which isn't part of the original structure.) Second, using an app, you can listen to explanations of selected works; but in many cases the descriptions are perfunctory."

I just visited this wonderful museum around the same time ILUVUNYC did and did not encounter any \"terrible\" staff anywhere as ILUVUNYC reported in a recent review. In fact, I found most of the staff quite neutral and unobtrusive, with a few actually being friendly. I was born in NYC and have lived there as an adult. I have been to museums around the world and have rarely if ever encountered such \"terrible\" behavior in a NYC museum.Having lived in NYC, I have been to the Frick Collection many times. In particular, I like its permanent collection, but I often go there for special exhibits and even concerts. I like the Frick in particular because although it has an incredible collection, I find it still has a rather intimate atmosphere. I am not doubting ILUVUNYC's recent unfortunate experience with one of the staff there, but I'm guessing that it was an unusual and random occurrence rather than the rule.The special exhibit I attended was focused on portraiture, particularly that of the Flemish painter, Anthony Van Dyck (Antoon van Dyck), and others of his time. In a lower, basement-like gallery, most of the exhibit was composed of sketches or drawings done prior to the artist's tackling of the final product, usually a painting or often etchings, which were at the time a common method of producing a larger number of printed likenesses of the same subject. A lot of historical information was presented with each of these drawings, and often the finished work was referenced in small, pictorial form. The head and torso of a particular subject might be shown in original sketch form and then a side panel would show perhaps where the likeness of that one person was used in a larger painting of a group of persons. I'm interested in portraiture, so for me it was very interesting, and I spent considerable time before going to the upstairs gallery where many of Van Dyck's finished, full-sized paintings were on display. It is my understanding that the Frick Collection has quite a number of Van Dyck's paintings, but for this exhibit, I believe several were borrowed from other collections around the world as well. It was a beautiful and fascinating exhibit, but I'm not sure that it would be for everyone. Portraiture is, like still-life painting, a rather focused genre, and I can see that many museum-goers would quickly tire of looking at drawing upon sketch upon drawing of so many faces from the same time period done by the same artist or those like him. Fortunately, one could easily obtain relief by looking at any of the many other wonderful paintings and art objects which the Frick maintains, and after awhile, that's exactly what I did, which is why I've been here so many times.In short, the special exhibit on portraiture was very interesting, but the Frick has so much to offer that anyone with any interest in art in any of its many forms could easily spend a very pleasant and inspiring afternoon here."

I don't know if it was tolerated (it was witnessed by other staff people) because this is not a typical museum, but it was terrible and really ruined the experience for us.

From the gracefully curved staircase to the very feminine dining room covered with frescos about the stages of love by Fragonard, to the library with bookshelves up to the window sills to leave room for the art, each new room took my daughter, her friend and me to another world. The huge ballroom was covered with Rembrandts, Vermeers and other Dutch Masters all acquired by the owner before his death in 1919. It appeared as though he scoured all the castles and great houses of Europe and came home with some of the best art in all of them.

I have known about it for forty years, and am familiar with the artists and works therein from a long ago art history degree but it is not until you get there and walk through, periodically picking your jaw up from the carpet, that you realize how dense, how distilled, how intense the collection is. Constable. Turner. Vermeer. Hals. Rembrandt. Monet. Manet. Cimabue. Duccio. Reynolds. Fragonard. Gains borough. Bronzing. Holbein. El Greco. And many more. And they are all hanging there in the Frick mansion, very intimate, beautiful decor and interiors unlike the usual galley beige. The whole house is art. More than the sum of its parts. A compact and intense experience. If you can see only one museum in New York make it this one. The Metropolitan can be intimidating and unless you have studied beforehand, hard to get to the things you really want to see. You can get through the Frick in about two hours, including the 15 minutes to see the film about Frick's life and times, and a few minutes to sit quietly and decompress in the fountain atrium. That's about all you can take, or all I could, anyway, before getting to the 'brain full' state.The Frick does not admit children under 10. It is not really a place for younger teens either. Security is rigorous. Check your coat. No photography except by the fountain. You won't need pictures anyway as most of the artworks are in the leading survey textbooks of art history.For $20, this is the greatest bargain in New York city. There is no on-site cafe: I would suggest that after your Frick experience, walk over to Lexington where there is a variety of reasonably priced (by nyc standards ) eateries.I will go there again next time I am in nyc."

We hadn't been to the Frick for many years and, as it's a permanent collection, we thought \"been there, done that.\" We are so glad that we decided to pay a visit to one of the premier art collections in the world. We were reminded what a truly remarkable collection this is. Set in the Frick mansion, a visitor gets to see not only the architecture of a classic Fifth Avenue mansion, but the decorative and fine art mostly as it was displayed during the Frick's tenure there. And what a collection it is!! Masterworks of almost every era and style; no expense was too great for acquisition of the world's greatest art. I would even say that if a visitor has limited time in NYC, then go to the Frick and skip the Met. Less crowds, less hype, less craziness. There is no cafe, but it is conveniently located (just a few blocks south of the Met). I do not know if the audioguides are always included with admission, but they are a good little bonus as you can key in the number of whatever piece you are admiring and hear a little about it. A classic of New York in every way."

Their taste in art was excellent, and in a world with very few Vermeers, they managed to own three of them. The museum's collection doesn't include much past 1870 or much before 1300. There are several Turners, a collection of Sevres porcelain, and two rooms with portraits from many eras.On Sunday morning, customers are allowed to pay what they want."

Its collection of European master paintings and furniture is unparalleled. You see superb Rembrandt, Vermeer, Canaletto, Hals, Ingres, della Francesca, Goya, Bellini, El Greco, van Dyck and Fragonard (to name just a few) literally steps away from each other. It makes me laugh to see Holbein's Sir Thomas More and Oliver Cromwell, mortal enemies in life, hanging near each other. I don't feel exhausted or defeated afterwards. You can easily spend an entire day visiting museums like the Met or the Louvre and feel you've only seen a fraction of what they have and absorbed even less. Instead, I feel elevated, energized by this heady dose of great art. I also love seeing these paintings hanging on the walls of what used to be a private home. It satisfies my fantasies of being extremely wealthy, living in a magnificent mansion on Fifth Avenue, being able afford masterpieces and having the taste to buy the very best."

We see portions of much larger collections, and it's a tasting menu from all over the world from various centuries. It's essentially the mainstay of being an art-savvy New Yorker. However, the Frick is the preserved and expanded private collection of a key figure from the Industrial Age in the US. The paintings, sculptures, furnishings and housewares are among the best of their times, and the focus is the Renaissance through the Impressionists, as selected much by Frick himself. This is much smaller than the Met, and it's a jewelry box of great works - by comparison, a nifty photo book versus the weighty tomb. If you are touring the great private smaller museums of the US, the Frick is on the list with the Getty, the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Isabella Stewart Gardner, and the Barnes. It's a must see for any enthusiast of 16th-20th century European fine arts."

Strolling through this stately mansion, in which many of the furnishings (carpets, tables, lamps, etc. of the late 19th and early 20th century) fill the galleries in which the paintings are arrayed (never crowded, always arranged in the context of the rooms) is a graceful, relaxing process. There are some remarkable examples of paintings by Holbein, Vermeer, El Greco, Rembrandt and Titian regally installed. A lively Rococo room with Boucher paintings, delightful Impressionist works and a good selection of Flemish paintings are found as you stroll, In the center of this palatial space is a lovely little garden with foliage, benches and a fountain. The words luxurious and tranquil come to mind. There are also special, temporary exhibitions on view, typically held in the lower level galleries. I've been to the Frick too often to count - and I honestly feel that a visit to New York is incomplete without a visit to this magical little musum!"

I enjoyed the mansion tour almost as much as the collection. The information provided with the headsets were very informative for each piece and not overdone. I would definitely recommend a tour to both history and art lovers. The video was interesting as well. On our next trip to Pittsburgh, we have the original Frick Mansion on our list.NOTE: If you are on a budget, you might want to stop by on Sunday mornings when they offer donation payments for admission."

Suggest visiting Sunday from 11 to 1 because you can pay what you wish. Unfortunately, we should have visited this after the Met - but anything would be let down.The museum is lovingly preserved and all the guards are friendly, knowledgeable and keen to please. The courtyard is a beautiful oasis in a busy city. For me, seeing the Renoir from afar on the staircase (unfortunately cordoned off) was worth it."

The self-guided tours enhance the visual feast with explanations and details of the house, its artifacts and spectacular collection of significant works of art. The collection reflects Henry Clay Frick's personal taste and runs well within a type. Portraits abound largely of one period of time and with only one American painter, Whistler. There is a small room of early Italian art and enamels on metal. Furniture pieces are art objects also. Take advantage of the twenty minute film giving the biography of the benefactor as well as information about the mansion and the collection. It is directly across the street from Central Park on the Northeastern side. In good weather the trip can include activities there. We were just there, winter of course, and it was still a wonderful use of time."

While we didn't have time to take the docent tour I did walk by one, and the guide seemed well versed, easy to hear and understand and I was a bit jealous of the participants. Like the Freedom Trail in Boston which seems to be a tourist thing that locals ignore, many NYC folks have never been inside the Frick and don't know what they are missing. I made the quick trip to NYC specifically to enjoy the Frick and was not disappointed. I will go back another time for the bigger establishments. They need to lower the price for the 60 plus crowd. 65 is too long to wait. I almost missed the view of the painting and stairwell to the second floor. Beautiful wood work and details.

We were staying on 63rd street on the east side and had walked past the Frick a few times without even realising it was there (including the day we walked up to the Guggenheim, ironically!)I would argue that the Frick collection is better, though unarguably the Guggenheim appeals to a greater variety of tastes and, of course, there's the building's own architecture.But the Frick appeals on a number of levels too. As an Australian not familiar with New York architecture, I found the display rooms fascinating in themselves! And to the painting-buff (there are more paintings than anything else) there is very much a European bent - I'm getting the idea that Americans don't think very highly of American artists?! Not much weird modern art either, which suited my taste.So if you want to see a lot of Van Dyck, Gainsborough, Boucher and the like, there are some jaw-dropping rooms where you feel surrounded by artworks all demanding and deserving of your attention, because there are not that many people in there to provide it to them!You need to allocate at least 3-4 hours to do justice to the collection, then grab lunch after you leave at one of the cafes on the upper east side, as the Frick is not a tourist hub by any means and you can't eat there.Finding the Frick was a serendipitous discovery and perhaps my highlight of the trip."

I would say that if you're uptown and don't have a lot of time to spend, this would be the place to go if you want to see a fabulous collection of masterpieces all in one place. It's a gorgeous mansion on 5th avenue, and it has a fascinating history. You'll find Rembrandt, Fragonard, Romney, Turner, Whistler and other great artists represented in a beautiful setting. Yes, I give it 5 stars."

The permanent collection is not to be missed, of course, and as usual I admired Holbein's portraits of Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell, the three Vermeers, Bronzino's young man, Hobbema's and Turner's landscapes, and other treasures. This time I saw for I think the first time Van Dyck's full-length portrait of Sir John Suckling, my favorite among the Cavalier poets. Had it been stored away for a time?

An expansive art collection set in an equally expansive private home of the Frick family, converted in the 1930s into a museum for the public. The Frick Collection ranges from portraits of beautiful women by Gainsborough to more personal statements by Goya, Rembrandt, Holbein, el Greco, Hals, and Vermeer. It truly leaves an impression for the paintings, sculpture, and even ceramics to be seen in a home setting, largely displayed as they were at the beginning of the 20th century. During my visit, there was also an excellent exhibit of sketches and paintings by Andrea del Sarto, which was worth cost of admission by itself.Though the Frick collection has grown since Henry Frick's death in 1913, the artwork he purchased is specifically stipulated to stay in the home at all times, meaning you see at least most of the original collection at all times. There is a large indoor courtyard, built onto the home in its conversion to a museum, that is an excellent resting place for reflection. I highly recommend the tours throughout the day, which are led by knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides. Audioguides are included in admission and also highly recommended as most of the art does not have descriptions on the walls.Note that there is a small giftshop, but no cafe or food on premises. There are several restaurants nearby, including Maison Laduree, Via Quadronno, and the food stands in Central Park across 5th Avenue."

On Sundays they offer \"pay what you wish\" for admission, but keep in mind this will attract large crowds. It's not a large exhibit, and I only spent about 1 hour or so going through everything. Sit down and enjoy the peacefulness of the Garden Court or enjoy the Goya, Vermeer, and Bernini artworks. It certainly does not offer as much as the Met, but it is a nice hidden gem in the Upper East Side of New York."

The paintings themselves consist of the best of English18th and 19th century panting, including many gainsboroughs. The sculpture and ceramics were very interesting and eclectic. My favorite paintings were the murals made to mockingly reflect the artwork on the walls in a few of the chambers. This house was partially designed to house Frick's collection, so it is a perfect setting. One is not allowed to see the living quarters of the Fricks, which is a real shame. If you're not a fan of 19th century English art or fancy Robber Baron manors, you might want to give this one a pass."

Some changes have been made in recent years to highlight museum pieces, done with such exceptional taste that it's very difficult to see where they've been carried out. Grand staircase is absolutely stunning with pipe organ built in. We specifically went to see the oil paintings by Turner purchased by Frick from the Sir James Dunn collection from New Brunswick Canada. Staff told us Frick purchased 3 Turners plus 3 other paintings from the Dunn collection but 'Dieppe Harbour' is the only one they can point out by name. We highly recommend a visit to this museum. Easy 20 minute walk from the Plaza Hotel or Bergdorf Goodman's."

Inside all is cool and calm and the collection is truly wonderful. The atmosphere is so familiar I have to keep looking out of windows to see yellow cabs driving by to prove to myself I'm not in a National Trust property back in England. It's hard to pick out favourites, but the chance to see three (count them!) Vermeers in one permanent collection takes a bit of beating. A real joy."

You can tell Mr. Frick was drawn to the innocent, the virtuous, and the natural. He's a romantic and the art and house together really show more of his wonderful taste, and taste usually comes from virtue (or lack therof). I wish Mr. Hearst in California was influenced by and took pointers from the collection at the Frick instead of decorating his castle with trashy goth stuff. Frick did it right and you'll still feel welcomed as a guest, even long after his death."

I figured I'd get more out of it this time. I did. First, if you're not someone who enjoys hearing somewhat snooty commentary about Sevres porcelain or the history of exquisite writing desks, about 1/3rd of the audio tour will be somewhere between uninteresting and slow torture. But stick with it because I learned a lot - particularly about Fragonard and Boucher - Rococo artists whose works in the Frick are amazing. The commentary on the audio about what the artists were up to in each picture made sure I got more out of the visit. I also had an \"Oh my God\" moment when the audio mentioned that two Veronese paintings had once been owned by in the 1600s by Queen Christina of Sweden -- very strange to be in the same room with something that belonged to a famous royal hundreds of years ago.I have two new favorite paintings from this visit. The Wool Winder by Jean-Baptiste Greuze (had never heard of him before) and Winter by Francois Boucher. The museum is stuffy and a little hard on the feet. Since the commentary is so thorough, take breaks in the refreshing courtyard by the fountain if you're getting tired. There's also a film about the history of Henry Clay Frick and the collection that makes for a good rest. "

You sort of get two attractions at once at the Frick Collection: a great art exhibition of old masters and a visit to a large mansion that faces Central Park. One can't even dream of the wealth that Mr. Frick must have had in his day. The mansion is on par with the Vanderbilt Mansion in Hyde Park, NY but not quite as large. Some of the furnishings displayed reminded us of the Winterthur museum in Wilmington, Delaware. However, the real reason to visit is for the art collection which is very impressive. The various originals are fine examples of some of the well known classical artists including Durer, van Dyck, Goya, Rembrandt, Vermeer and others. The West Gallery was most impressive to me with its paintings easily accessible to visitors. Two Holbein paintings grace the Living Hall and are easily recognizable by most people-- a portrait of Sir Thomas Moore and another of his archrival, Thomas Cromwell. Again, you can walk right up to these painting to see the amazing detail. Entry fees for the museum are about what you would expect for a museum of this type in a major city. They do offer reciprocity with many other art museums across the country so if you are a member of reciprocal museum, you will be admitted for free. You can also get a senior discount. Sunday mornings they offer free or pay-as-you-wish admission depending on the time you arrive (must be before 1PM however). It is a smaller museum so it does not require reservations or timed tickets plus, it is a delightful respite from the noise of the city. I would highly recommend it even to first time visitors to NYC."

Expertly curated, must have been a monumental effort to get pieces from the Louvre, Hermitage, Berlin, Prado, Getty, Uffizi. The house itself is gaudy, stuffed with show-off pieces (Ming vases, Sevres/Limoges porcelains you get the point) but one cannot get around the fact that Frick managed to collect some of the world's absolute masterpieces - Rembrandt, Velazquez, magnificent de la Tour, perhaps the best Piero della Francesca in the country. Another thing i liked was the mixing and matching of artists and often, periods. The contrast relaxes the mind and helps it appreciate art better - something that the Met should learn about. What I did not like was the steep entrance fee ($20) - for what? Are they scalping college students in order to maintain the house? Acquire new Rembrandts? Aesthetically, the place is somewhat oppressive, especially the decadent central courtyard - compare it, for example,with the lightness and tastefulness of the Getty. And one cannot escape that these pieces were amassed purchased by the guy who hired the Pinkerton guns-for-hire (for Carnegie), who massacred the workers who were asking for better living wages and conditions. In other words, we are talking robber barons at their most hypocritical - art was paid for with the blood of the miners/steelworkers massacred so that Frick could walk through his hallways at night and gaze at the Gainsborough ladies and own auto portraits. If you like art visiting here is a must. But without being aware of the larger perspective - one keeps perpetuating the ignorance and denies art its very message."

He moved to New York city and built his home on 5th Avenue, opposite Central Park.His life-long passion was collecting art and after he moved to New York he focused on European old masters. Visitors today are the beneficiaries of Frick's passion.Perhaps the outstanding feature of the collection is the scale. Other museums such as the Met, just \"up the block\" from the Frick are overwhelming, particularly to visitors who may have limited time. The Frick Collection can be enjoyed in a single day, while giving ample time to appreciate the art.The Collection consists of porcelains and small bronzes, and the star attraction which is a marvelous collection of old masters: for example, two Rembrandts, several wonderful Vermeers, Titian, El Greco, Turner, Reynolds, Goya, Constable and many others. In addition, are several excellent impressionists such as Renoir and Degas. The gallery itself is worth the visit. Several room are furnished with original furniture. The central atrium is a quiet and impressive retreat.There is a small gift shop with a varied and interesting selection of Frick souvenirs and items with a broader perspective.There is no outlet for food or drink, but \"in-and-out\" privileges allow one to find sustenance in the area. We were directed to Lexington Avenue, three blocks east, where we found an excellent cafe (Corrado Bread and Pastry) for an excellent and reasonably priced lunch.Entry fees are a very reasonable $20 ($15 for seniors) and docent talks and an audio guide are free.The Frick is a \"must see\"!"

It's perfect for a rainy day or if you need a break from the razzle and dazzle of NYC. It's a short walk from the Met, but not crowded and grand like it. Its grandiosity is subtle and sophisticated, something like having one delicate and amazing petit four for dessert, instead of the chocolate mud cake."

Frick is a beautiful collection of art and period furniture in the mansion which was the home of Mr Frick, one of the leading industrialists of 19th century. The collection and his house are amazing. Free/ included in the price of tickets - Audio tour really makes it very interesting and there are so many interesting stories and facts to learn and enjoy. Sunday 11 am to 1pm is pay what you wish. Children under 10 are not allowed and no photography in the museum. Photography is allowed only in the garden court, which was added later on when house was being converted into a museum. Do recommend the docent tour of the dining room. No food cafe here but one can walk and get to places to eat and then come back to enjoy the museum, as reentry is permitted with the ticket stubs. Make sure to watch the 15 minute film about Mr Frick. Plan on around 2 hours to see the place but one can easily take more time to enjoy this beautiful mansion. "

Unlike in a large museum, you have time and space to enjoy the art work which is in every room. And what art work. Everything on display is worth examining and admiring. Not a wasted moment. The admission of $20 per person is a little steep but, in a hectic city, it does mean you have an atmosphere of quiet calm to nurture your soul."

If you aren't into portrait art and related history, skip the art and just enjoy a great NY mansion."

It is impressive to see how many art treasures were amassed by one wealthy man who generously gave it all as a museum after his death. It is a small quiet space compared to the other NYC museums we have visited. The Sarto exhibit at this museum , which will be temporary, was very impressive as were the pieces of dresden china. Take a couple of hours and enjoy the atmosphere of this museum!"

No walking traffic with \"excuse me\" and \"pardon me.\"Having \"Collection\" in its title is totally appropriate. While visiting museums is nice, perusing the furniture, tapestries, moldings, material usage, lower level exhibit, ... was incredibly entertaining. Posted guides noticed if you had a special interest in a particular facet and some even approached you to share additional information or to point out \"be sure to check out...\"What a special treat! We even enjoyed the store; such an eclectic and useful mix of ideas. Be sure to give yourself time to appreciate the rooms.

What makes the Frick rare is that the architecture of the 'museum' is as beautiful as the collection of paintings that reside in it. The Frick is a collection of paintings that once belonged to Henry Frick, and they usually also have one featured painting (from a visiting museum). I highly recommend anyone who appreciates great art to spend some time at the Frick Museum - the collection is predominantly European artists.The mansion itself, located on the UES, is beautiful and grand - take some time to enjoy sitting in the garden to embrace the majestic ambiance of the place."

A critical part of an aesthetic moment is your ability to connect with the art in the right state of mind and with the right context.

That is what the Frick delivers. We loved it."

Quite extensive and quite eclectic but very much a private collection now on display ., I gather Frick himself was quite a villain ( key bad guy in the Holmestead Strike) but his collection is beautiful . Amazing that one man could isn all this . I loved the Rembrandt,self portrait . I have seen others snd they always have an effect on me . They say this is the most powerful and maybe it is . The display is great . Very manageable in a couple of hours . The audio tour is first rate . The staff were fairly helpful ( though one fellow that I asked about which room I was in , didn't seem quite sure ) . The suggested route is very helpful . The video was quite good .

How very lovely after crowded museums with so much from which to choose to spend time in this Fifth Avenue mansion, savoring as you wish the various rooms replete with paintings and decorative arts of other kinds. So glad we went."

The fact that an individual was able to amass such a vast collection is noteworthy. The collection is diverse including Old Masters paintings, sculptures and interior design. The house, its own story and architectural design definitely adds appeal.A self-guided audio tour is included in admission. This provided a wealth of information. In order to operate the device, you will need to input numbers that correspond to specific pieces. The numbers next to each piece were not printed very large, so if you are low vision/visually impaired, you will definitely need some assistance.Allocate approx 2-3 hours to view the collection. If you like house museums, the house itself is not really available for touring. The collections encompasses the first floor only. Nonetheless, the house itself is interesting to compare to those of other robber barons and captains of industry.If you are a DOCENT from any museum, bring your staff ID - admission is waived. I forgot my ID and had to pay but it was worth it."

The house was designed to be an art museum featuring his collection once he died. This gives the museum a more inviting feel, instead of the sterile feeling you can get from some museums. The architecture and interior design alone makes this a worthwhile visit. The collection is varied but not disjointed. The collection has more classical art; for what I can remember there are no art pieces that fit the board category of modern art. The museum is moderate size, which allows you to take the time to enjoy the art pieces, without overwhelming the senses."

Visiting the FRICK COLLECTION recently was a wonderful experience; but, the presence of the Frick in my cultural life, and as a premiere cultural foundation of the city, is more important than any individual study-experience there. The modestly sized Frick Museum is located right down Fifth Avenue from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and makes for a pleasant add-on to any visit to the Met. The Frick was developed from the elegant Victorian mansion built for Henry Clay Frick and the sense of personally visiting his home is appealingly resonant during any time spent there. Velvet ropes cover the massive staircase in the receiving hallway, but one certainly hankers to mount the stairs and meet the man in his study\u2014properly dressed for the occasion, of course. This last time I was visiting the Frick in order to view Frederic Leighton\u2019s startlingly beautiful \u201cFlaming June,\u201d on special loan from the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Puerto Rico, a museum developed by a dear friend of mine from many moons ago. This large canvas with a striking square aspect-ratio depicts a young red-headed maiden dozing in a diaphanous tangerine gown on the ocean-viewing veranda in some Classical Greek paradise. You can smell the fresh blossoms and hear the distant sea.\u201cFlaming June\u201d was displayed in the open grandeur of the Frick\u2019s Oval Room, which also houses four other full-length portraits by James McNeill Whistler. It was simply breathtaking, set off as it was by the muted tones of velvet wall paper surrounding it, and the subtle palette of its tall, elegant neighbors not curled up asleep.The Frick Collection is also a special treasury for Fragonards -- in both oils and tapestry -- chief among them the delightful series, \u201cThe Progress of Love.\u201d I\u2019m drawn more, though, toward smaller canvases more intimate in their charms. As a mere dilettante, it\u2019s good for me to be reminded that the experience viewing many of the featured masterpieces has been enhanced by significant restoration projects, particularly of the lighting -- not only of the galleries themselves, but also in subtle LED sweet spots upon certain paintings, among them the peerlessly austere beauty of Bellini\u2019s \u201cSt. Francis in the Desert.\u201d Although they no longer serve high tea at the Frick, there are numerous pleasing caf\u00e9s right nearby. BUT BE WARNED: part of the security for these fragile treasures housed in a real residence is that they want purses to be quite small, and mine doesn\u2019t make it in. I don\u2019t like checking it, so just as in museums and mansions in Russia; I change bags to a mini before coming. "

They made lots of money in the late 19th Century when money was really money. And, along with their contemporaries, they built fabulous homes on Central Park to show off their wealth. Only one of these homes survives. The Frick mansion which houses the Frick collection. Which is fabulous (money buys a lot of art). If you love architecture, history, art, and a great location it's worth a trip. If I were visiting and I had to choose, I'd skip the MOMA and the Guggenheim for this."

The central courtyard is very peaceful and it's a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. I can imagine arty types loving it so they can spend hour upon hour gazing at the complexities of some painting but not for me and TOTALLY beyond me why this scores above such amazing things to do such as Empire State Building or Intrepid which are a million times better than this place with it's contrived atmosphere."

Everything is well displayed and well labeled. The free audio guide is comprehensive. (Well, only two of the Vermeers are in the audio guide, but two for three isn't bad.)Frick was a robber baron, so the money to buy the paintings and precious objects came from his vicious business methods, which emphasized brutal strike-breaking. However, Frick is long gone, so we may as well enjoy the collection he amassed.Don't miss this museum when you're in NYC!"

The Frick is a unique museum with exotic Chinese porcelain pieces, sculpture and paintings, all of which were collected by steel magnate Frick for his home, with the understanding it would eventually become a museum. The audio guide is included in the entrance fee, and has somewhat longish descriptions of the pieces. You can easily see everything in about 2 hours."

Mr. Frick's art collection is beautifully displayed throughtfully with the architecture and decor in many original room designed around these magnificent works: Gainesborough, Rubens, Vermeer, Degas, Goya, and so many others are joys to see. There is a terrific movie about the building's history which is helpful to view. I highly recommend joining the docent's tour of the dining room for amazing insight into the room's design, artworks, history and stories about the Frick social dining."

Located on the stretch of Fifth Avenue known as the Museum Mile, it is about 10 blocks south of the Met. Housed in a beautifully designed grand home built just prior to the start of World War I, much of the collection is still displayed as it was when Henry Clay Frick lived there.The core of the collection, approximately two-thirds of the total, was acquired by Frick. His intention from the start was to have the house transformed into a museum and that the collection would be a living, growing one. The remaining third of the collection has been acquired by the museum since his death in 1919.The most impressive part of the collection is the wealth of Old Master paintings that line the walls. Such is the quality of these paintings that I suspect you will recognize one or two of them. There are also fine examples of 18th century furniture, terracottas, .bronze sculptures and porcelain pieces.The audio guide is quite good and is free with admission. The museum doesn't have a restaurant, but you'll find plenty of places around the corner on Madison Avenue and on the side streets.Helpful Hint: Admission on Sunday between 11AM and 1PM is whatever you wish to give. There was a small line waiting to get in when I went on the Sunday before Labor Day, but in New York you'll find longer lines at bus stops."

This wealthy industrialist's house on upper 5th Avenue couldn't have been put to better use than for it to be a gallery to house Mr Frick's extensive collection of the best of European art and artefacts. It's a calming oasis amid the Avenue's relentless traffic, and one encounters many gems of paintings that you know from books, but never realised they were here. I particularly liked Holbein's 16th century portraits of arch-rivals Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell facing each other grimly, but separated by a large fireplace. The Frick house itself (at least the ground floor and garden that I saw) is very fine and lavish in the style of late-19th century multi-millionaires. My only cavil with the institution is that it lacks a caf\u00e9, which on the 90-degrees day that I was there would have been a great asset, not to say money-spinner."

It is housed in the old Frick Estate (which is half the reason you should come) and has a much more warm and personal feel as opposed to other major museums. With that said, the admission is steep (and NOT suggested... except for on Sundays between 10am-2pm, where you can pay as you wish.

Having visited the Frick in Pittsburgh I was very interested to see the Frick Collection in New York. I was with my 13 year old granddaughter on this trip. The Frick is easy to find either with the metro or bus. The building is wonderful and was built by Henry Clayton Frick for his family but with the intention of having if function as a museum. Some House...the rooms are opulent and very spacious. The collection is wonderful and both my granddaughter and I loved the painting \"Flaming June\". Both the original small sketch and the very large painting adapted from the small one are on display. The colors and subject are beautifully done. My granddaughter was disappointed not to be able to take photos as she loved this painting..this is not unusual in a museum however. Sometime after the Fricks died and left the museum there were changes made to the building. The most impressive in my opinion was creating the garden and inner courtyard area that had once been a road. This is the only area in the building where picture taking is allowed. It is a peaceful and serene area and great if you need to be rejuvenated and rest your feet. The cost to see the collection and the building is reasonable and because it is a small, intimate museum it can be seen without consuming most of a day. Seeing this museum really added to my knowledge of the Frick family and the legacy they have left both here and in Pittsburgh. Highly recommend."

Henry Clay Frick knew what he was doing when he built his house on 5th Avenue to display his amazing collection of European paintings and works of sculpture. He had discerning taste and the art, hung as Frick and his guests would have seen it, reflects this. Admission includes an audio guide which keeps the museum very quiet and sedate as visitors are listening rather than talking. The overall mood is almost reverential. The other noticeable feature of this gallery is that there are no children. Under 10s are not allowed."

What should have been a wonderful experience, and in some way it was to simply to see the art work on display and the building itself, was marred from the attitude of the people was look at you.

There's an excellent array of Old Masters, including a couple of Rembrandts, Turners, and Vermeers--it doesn't get much better than that. The collection reflects Frick's personal preferences, rather than those of an art specialist, but overall is remarkably good. Seeing these things in the context of Frick's own late 19th-century mansion adds to the experience, though you'll find nothing to match the charm and quirkiness of Isabella Stewart Gardner's Venetion-style \"palazzo\" in Boston. The collection includes four Whistler full-length portraits--probably the most recent items the Frick owns. Well worth the cost of admission."

The gift shop is small but at the same time has wonderful books and pieces to purchase as a reminder of your visit...and the ladies in the shop are smiling and very friendly. My only caution to anyone how has breathing problems is that certain rooms caused me to have breathing issues due to a moldy odour.

I spent about 1 and a half hours touring the collection and it was as much a tour of the mansion as it was perusing the art on the walls. I do not appreciate art enough to spend too much time at a gallery, but the mansion itself and history of it's inception made it very interesting. Strolling along Central Park up Fifth Avenue on a nice summer day is wonderful too. The price is $20 and it includes the audio tour which is most useful and I was very pleasantly surprised that it was included. I am very glad I went."

This museum houses one of my favorite paintings which is Thomas More by Holbein - I could just look at this painting for hours, it's so alive and sympathetic.The fact that these fabulous works of art are presented in what was Frick's private residence makes the experience more intimate and rewarding than other museums in NYC for me. There are enough quality paintings, sculptures, china, furniture etc to keep you occupied for hours even though the museum itself is quite small scale. I liked that he often chose to display matching paintings together such as a husband and wife or the Thomas More Holbein opposite Holbein's Cromwell - arch enemies eyeing one another for eternity!There's a good audio guide.At the centre of the museum is a beautiful plant covered courtyard"

The Frick Mansion on 5th Avenue at 70th Street looks like a suddenly unknown angle view of the Trianon had landed gracefully there garden and all. Amazingly enough, but inside it gets better than Trianon.Mr. Frick's Collection is the best of the famous robber baron fortunes. It as miraculously assembled and perfectly displayed: There is a French room all covered with Fragonard panels, matched by the beauty of the French furniture and porcelain collection. In our age of Conceptual and Investment Art it is very difficult to think that when people had money they actually could live surrounded by all this great objects that have authentic quality, great provenance and that actually look perfect with the paintings.Close by there is another room also with panels by Boucher that were specifically done for the infamous Mme de Pompadour, mistress of Louis XV, a dilettante with interest in art only as a means of self promotion and personality projection, she would have felt right at home in this room though at the time they were finally finished she rejected the works because the fashion had changed.There is an English Chippendale style dining room with a great collection of silver and portraits by Gainsborough including the beautiful Mrs. Elliot, mistress to the Duc d'Orleans that voted for his cousin's death (Louis XVI) and was guillotined himself shortly after, yet Mrs. Elliot who was in Paris at the time was not, because she was a British subject and eventually went back to England.The collection has a grand gallery that displays two truly wonderful Turners, a Velazquez portrait that is open of the best he ever painted of Philip IV, two fabulous Veronese allegories, a very impressive self portrait by Rembrandt, Van Dycks, Frans Hals, Tintoretto, Corot...and around the room there is a great collection of Renaissance bronzes and cassonne in case you may need respite, the paintings spill over other rooms: Three Grecos, Four Goyas, THREE Vermeers, each one better than the last one, and that's about 10% of the ENTIRE output of Vermeer! a great Bronzino, A Bellini of St Francis that is as radiant as the saint's spirit, two great Titians including the great Aretino, the first media genius and playwright. There is the portrait of St Thomas More by Holbein that is illustrated in all the books on Henry VIII, and next to it across the fireplace the chancellor that succeeded him and was also beheaded and also by Holbein, this amidst an extraordinary gathering of Boulle furniture and Chinese porcelain.There are also French Renaissance enamels, in a little room, recently restored where there is a Duccio that is twice the size of the one at the MET, and treasures by Piero della Francesca and Cimabue among others.Although better known for the Old Masters housed there the Frick has quite a few masterpieces of Impressionist art: Renoir, Degas and Manet all have great paintings there and Whistler has several, including a seascape and the famous portrait he painted of the Baron de Montesquieu, who inspired Proust's character the Baron de Charlus in his famous Remembrance of Things Past.The central court garden and fountain is one of the few rare public spaces in NY that is peaceful, serene, and restful, there are sometimes temporary exhibits around this garden and also downstairs in a two gallery space that can be reached by the staircase that is right in front of the bookshop.There is a new additional gallery overlooking the garden to accommodate rotating exhibits of the Frick's great collection of Meissen porcelain, don't miss it as it it is only accessible through the library.The shop at the Frick is one of the few remaining quality bookstores in the city, like the Frick House and Collection the collection it is small, but every inch filled with quality."

This is a wonderful house with a great collection of art, mostly 17th and 18th century European paintings, and we went deliberately to see a Vermeer painting. Go early enough and get to the head of the queue at 10.30am and it isn't too crowded once you get in; wait a little longer and you might find your experience impaired a bit, since it is a house (admittedly a large one) and not a gallery or museum. It can all be seen in 45-60 minutes, so plenty of time to beat the crowds and head off to lunch or Central Park."

I would recommend people take the time to watch the short film about Henry Clay Frick, his beginnings, how he obtained his wealth and what he chose to do with it, namely put together a fabulous collection of old and new masters. It's not a huge museum of art if you compare it to the Metropolitan opposite, but in some ways that makes it more enjoyable. It is one man's obsession and each of the rooms that you walk through reveal how good an eye he had."

The Holbein painting of Sir Thomas More is the highlight for me but every famous artist is represented, I approached one painting I thought was a Monet, silly me it was a Dagas, the Monet was opposite. If you have interest in Old Masters you must visit, if you think you ought to have an interest this is the best introduction possible. Simply world class."

Whilst it doesn't contain as much art as the Metropolitan or MoMa, it does house a very nice collection indeed, and I very much enjoyed the paintings by Turner, Vermeer and Whistler, as well as the current showpiece - Flaming June by Frederic Leighton.The building itself is a work of art and whilst the recommended admission fee of $20 is a little expensive if compared with the $25 for the larger galleries, it is pleasure to visit and enjoy."

There is an excellent movie explaining who Robert Frick was and why he donated his collection to the people of NYC. I love that he collected stuff that he himself loved. The portrait of Sir Thomas Moore is gorgeous. You are not allowed to take photographs unfortunately. The mansion is stunning and visitors get a real feel for how the rich lived back in the days of the Robber Barons. Do not miss this museum!!!"

The court paintings of Holbein, the Impressionists, the Dutch Masters and many more types of art are displayed here. You think you're in someone's living room--which it was.Perfect views of Central Park enhance the setting.It is difficult to believe that one man owned this home and the art in it.Superb!"

The house is virtually unchanged since Frick lived in it, although some furnishings have been removed. What's also amazing about the home is it's location. Strange to see a house of this size on a piece of land this size in Manhattan, or anywhere in NYC, for that matter. When you enter the museum they hand you a headset to wear, but no one tells you how to use it or suggests a route to go. There are a lot of people working there, but no one was particularly friendly or helpful. After not being able to get my headset to work, I gave it back, and was not offered a new one, or offered any help when explaining mine didn't work. We didn't have a lot of time, though, anyway, and I feel the headset would've slowed me down, because it goes over almost every piece in this enormous collection. I spent my time studying the velvet line walls and architectural details. I did look at most of the paintings, and the collection is impressive, for sure. There is no access to the upstairs. I asked one of the guards about it, and she explained it has never been open the public. I asked if Frick's family ever stayed there, and she said no, although they have been known to drop in from time to time. She said that when Frick died, the home was turned into a museum, as were his wishes. Definitely stop by here if you have a morning or afternoon to spare. It's kind of a hidden gem in the city."

Frans Hals (many) to one of Gilbert Stuart's wonderful portrayals of 'George Washington'. There were quite a few Gainsborough's and beautiful Whistler's too.

I am glad I did -- if you want to get a sampling of art from various periods of history, paintings and porcelain mostly, and you do not want to bump into 500 Chinese tourists taking pictures or children screaming, as you will at the Met and MOMA, this is a good place to be. There were a couple of early Turners (my favorite artist, very good movie), a couple not so late; lots of portraiture, Goya to Gainsborough et al; and the building itself is quite stunning, a muted testament to the wealth of the man and the lifestyle of the rich during the Gilded Age. I sense there are free tours, I was invited by the young guide if I wanted to join, I had already strolled the place but had an I engaged in a very interesting conversation for ten minutes, he knew his stuff and I assumed gave an excellent tour. One downside is there is no coffee shop, a helpful docent recommended Via Quadronno on 73rd off of Madison and it was - shock of shocks - reasonably priced (for that neighborhood in New York) and had excellent service and food. Bottom line -- the Frick is well worth the $20."

Like many of his rich contemporaries he built a mansion here in Manhattan. His home (the Museum) is exquisite. His private collection is unparalleled. Perhaps the greatest private collection in the world. I'm sure it is. Very interesting man indeed. He was not a nice person. He was basically a thug or \"Capo\" for Dale Carnegie (Carnegie Steel Company) and yet here we see a side of him very few people probably knew. I know he lost a daughter and perhaps it touched him and reflected in the Art he purchased. Not one Masterpiece in this collection depicts war. In this relatively small museum we find Vermeer, Rembrandt, Titian, de Goya, Bellini, El Greco, Velasquez, and the list goes ON. it's simply mind boggling, the Frogonard room is Spectacular. His 2 Holbein's facing each other is insane. The stairway, gardens and above all the intimacy of this very personal museum makes it my Favorite. Hope you stop at The Frick Collection.

The mansion, built in 1913-14, which was their home for awhile, has become a splendid place to look and enjoy their art collection. He collected many of the old masters, eighteenth-century French furniture, porcelains, Limoges enamels, oriental rugs, sculptures, and some artists from NYC. It was also kind of neat to see two pieces of art that were done by of my wife's relative - George Romney. So this made it kind of special to visit."

Two things stuck out in my mind as I visited the Frick last week.First is you get an audio handset that you can use to listen to descriptions of the paintings. Most paintings have a three digit number on them, and you type that three digit number into your handset to listen to a 45 second description of the painting. This really made this visit great fo rme as I could find paintings I liked, and then listen to the description of it and find out details about the painting that were not readily apparent.The second thing I liked was the small size of the Frick. The small size was great since it was very manageable to see the entire collection in about two hours. You do not get the overwhelmed feeling like you do in large art galleries.The quality of the artists was great and included Vermeer, Manet, and Monet. It also had Gilbert Stuart's George Washington painting.The Frick is located just off the east side of Central Park on about 70th street. It was a great and peaceful visit in such a hectic city.If you are a member of your local art gallery, check to see if the Frick offers reciprocity. I am a member of the Cummer Art Galley in Jacksonville, FL so I got free admission to the Frick which was great."

If you can only see one art museum in NYC, the formal Frick collection is the place to go with absolutely every painting being of the highest artistic quality including an absolutely top notch Ingres and three luminous paintings by Vermeer. As a cherry on top, a little exhibit of Sir Frederic Leighton's beautiful painting, \"Flaming June\" was on display flanked by two lovely portraits of young ladies by Whistler, a treat indeed! I would advise seeing the introductory film on the collection that was much enjoyed by my son as it explained the background of the mansion and collection and then also described the works of art and layout. It is short and concise but most helpful to the first time visitor. Enjoy the amazing works of art, decorative arts, the poetic atmosphere of the mansion and glimpses of the gardens and the central court.

You are never rushed to finish nor overwhelmed.I've been there when there were orchids in the rooms, with their pedigree typed beside them.The atrium with its pool is such a relaxing setting.Don't miss Renoir's La Promenade, in the stairwell.The Frick is often open a little later than other museums on the stretch, and that's helpful too.They don't let you sit on most of the furniture, but you can relax in the atrium or in the theatre and watch a movie about Mr. Frick.I go every time I'm in New York - four times now in the last six months.

To my shame, I've walked past this beautiful old mansion on 5th Ave for years without venturing in; I knew it was a world famous collection, but always had better things to do: or so I thought - I'm kicking myself that I haven't visited more often. It wasn't until I realised it housed Holbein's portrait of St Thomas More that I visited and I'm so glad I did - and I've been back several times since. Incidentally, staring at More from the opposite side of the fireplace is Holbein's portrait of Thomas Cromwell (the man who brought More down).Most of the art is European and was collected by industrialist Henry Frick and displayed on the ground floor rooms of his NYC residence. Some of the rooms are relatively small, so it can be a little crowded - especially around some of the most famous works. Being a small museum has its advantages - it's very intimate and you can see the art at close quarters. It also has some disadvantages: there's not a huge range of visitor amenities, of course there are restrooms, a shop, and free bag and coat check. But there's nowhere for refreshments and a couple of the staff can be a little on the grumpy side. There is a free audio guide, which is well worth getting and the museum has a \"pay what you want\" admission policy on Sundays from 11am. If you get museum/art gallery fatigue quickly, this is a perfect place: as it's relatively small you could see the majority of the collection in under 2 hours. It's also a perfect place if you're like me (I feel that I want to see everything when I go to museums so leave places like the Met or British Museum, where it's impossible to see everything in a day, with an unresolved feeling) - you can easily see the collection in one visit, but never tire of it on subsequent trips."

Why I waited so long, I have no idea! Stunning artwork in a classic NYC residence in a beautiful neighborhood! It's easy (too easy!) to imagine living in that elegant environment, with the art as the star attraction. The best reason to visit this summer--Leighton's gorgeous Victorian school \"Flaming June,\" on loan from Puerto Rico until early September. I've tromped through a lot of museums in America and Europe, but have never paid much attention to Victorian art. This painting instantly became one of my favorites of any school, any period, ever. The composition is quite different, and the central color--a vibrant, breathtaking orange sorbet--makes the painting dessert for your brain! Make sure to stop in the museum's video room for a fascinating presentations on \"Flaming June\" and the history of the Frick house. Loved the whole experience!"

This time I took my teenage daughter who is a painter herself. She loved it! The Frick is beautiful and classy, but not too large or overwhelming. It is definitely worth a visit. We got there at opening on a Saturday morning, and almost had the place to ourselves. We roamed around for about 90 minutes, completely unhurried, enjoying everything we saw. It was a great visit. Just wish I lived closer so I could visit more often."

The Frick is by far my favorite! The museum was actually Henry Clay Frick\u2019s mansion. He designed and built the mansion intending for it to be used as a museum later on. Although small, it houses beautiful and famous works by Gainsborough, Fragonard, Whistler, and Turner. The furniture, tapestries, fixtures and artifacts are also works of art and complement the paintings very well. The museum also has a peaceful courtyard with lush greens and fountains, a beautiful garden, as well as an event space where various small concerts are held every year for $35 a performance! Concert-goers are able to enter the museum free of charge an hour before the performance to explore the museum. It is highly recommended to attend one of these concerts. Seats are first come first serve so make sure to get there early! On Sundays from 11-1pm, its pay-as-you-wish. Definitely get the free audio guide. You must use the coat check or wear your coat; you are not allowed to carry it. Also, there is no museum caf\u00e9, as the museum is quite small."

So, yes, I've seen the portraits of More and Cromwell, and I've seen some of the Limoges enamels, and yes, I've seen the Turners, but it's pretty clear I've not seen them face-to-face, nor would I ever.The museum is not super-crowded, and it forbids visits by children (which is contrary to a section of \"Fun Home\"), which makes for a quite pleasant experience. The special exhibit about porcelain made me think that maybe the Jacobins were right in the French Revolution, given that many of them were made during a period when the French had a fairly large fraction of their population starving."

Unlike New York's huge crowded museums the Frick is of human scale. No children under 10 reduces the crowds and gives more time to appreciate the art. Go on a Sunday morning when it opens and you pay what you want to enter (5$ seemed average when I went). The history is well explained in 20 minute film show and then a couple of hours will be enough time to tour the house and its treasures."

Going to this museum is like going to a rich uncles house. It is often times very quiet and not very crowded at all. The paintings are appointed in a spectacular display. The rooms are magnificent. And a stop here is well worth a visit. Spend roughly two hours here, you will not regret it!"

The top-notch architecture with exquisite materials and intricate detailing could never be as beautifully built today! And housed within this architectural masterpiece is an art collection that astounds in content and beauty. Works of the old masters chosen personally by Mr. Frick himself are beautifully displayed through-out the house. The collection is personal and impressive. What a treasure found in a city renowned for its art museums! Make this a part of your trip; you won't regret it. Oh, I don't think children are allowed as the art work is displayed out in the open, as it would be in any home."

I saw the Frick Collection museum, and thought, 'Why not?' Let me tell you, it was money well spent. My friend is not a frequent art museum attendant, so to stand back and watch her be 'sucked into' my world, was a true delight! This museum is actually an old mansion with a vast, interesting history. The architecture is spectacular within itself and the art is truly the icing on the cake. You can spend a little time there, or a lot, it is truly up to you.I enjoyed hearing about each piece as I listened to our little hand-held receivers. (The ones where you push in the number of the painting you are interested in.) My friend and I are so glad that we went. I encourage others to seek out this hidden gem that boasts a gorgeous in-door and outside garden area and beautiful sculptures as well."

Really, this is just a rich guy's house on 5th Ave on NY's upper east side. But it is a treat, and I would hate to see you miss it. There are some works of art that are world class. There is also an ambiance that arises from understanding the time from which these originate. This is a place on a must visit for New York, and a place on a must visit at least a couple of times a year for those of us pri'sonesrs in Manhattan. It is a concern that the museum is succumbing to large museum itis and looking to capital projects and additions, but the curator has done a good job so far in balance, and the show is worth the trip."

The bones of the house are still visible, and many of the rooms feature either original or period furniture. The living room still features the original interior design from when Mr. Frick first had the house built. Art in this collection includes paintings, enamels, porcelains, some small statues, furniture, hangings, clocks, books, and other small domestic pieces. I enjoyed the Turner seascapes, and my companion was transfixed by a small bronze representation of Hercules fighting the Hydra, where each head resembled a different monster. Children under 10 are not permitted, so it is a fairly quiet experience. Photos are only allowed in the atrium near the fountain."

Built as the New York home of the Frick Family, who were based in smoky Pittsburgh, it's a stunning limestone mansion built between 1912 and 1914 as a showpiece of wealth and \"good taste\". The family lived there for a time, and apparently it was staffed with over 20 servants. However, it was always meant to be a public legacy of wealth and opulence. Inside is a sizable collection of Old Masters paintings, sculptures and the finest indoor decorative arts. The museum and grounds are a relaxing place to contemplate New York as it once was, right before the Great War, when Robber Barons ruled the US."

He displays them beautifully, for example a portrait of Thomas Moore looks across a fire place at his nemesis Thomas Cromwell, with a picture by El Greco of the the man who translated the bible.

A substantial amount of his art collection is located in his former residence \"Clayton\" in Pittsburgh, which is today a part of the Frick Art & Historical Center. Another part was given by his daughter and heiress Helen to the Frick Fine Arts Building, which is on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.The family did not permanently move from Pittsburgh to New York until 1905. Henry Frick initially leased the Vanderbilt house at 640 Fifth Avenue, to which he moved a substantial amount of his collection. He had his permanent residence constructed from 1912 to 1914 by Thomas Hastings of Carr\u00e8re and Hastings. He stayed in the house until his death in 1919. He willed the house and all of its contents, including art, furniture, and decorative objects, as a public museum. His widow Adelaide Howard Childs Frick, however, retained the right of residence and continued living in the mansion with her daughter Helen. After Adelaide Frick passed away in 1931, the conversion of the house into a public museum started.John Russell Pope altered and enlarged the building in the early 1930s to adapt it to use as a public institution. It opened to the public on December 16, 1935.Further expansions of the museum took place in 1977 and in 2011."

There are a few paintings and objets d'art that are not to my taste (and not always of the greatest quality) but, pound for pound, this is one of the finest small museums in the world and highly recommended. It is on a par with the Uffizi in Florence which, though magnificent, is housed in a former palace and lacks some of the intimacy and personality of the Frick I was interested to note, amidst the drooling appreciation of so many visitors, that the Helman family in San Rafael were so underwhelmed by the Frick. I would be curious to hear which museums induced rapture in them. Perhaps they might like to wander round the Frick a second time with me in tow! I could fly over from London to perambulate across the collection with them and others besides. There is so much to savour and chew on at the Frick rather than consume whole. Moreover, there is a pleasure in sharing the pleasure of others even if It does not always accord with your own. As it happens, I composed an article a few years ago, entitled Day Trip, about an afternoon at the Frick that gives a more considered view of the overall experience. I wrote it when I was in NYC on business so do please let me know if you would like me to send a copy to get a better idea of where I am coming from and, indeed, where I may be going. All comments welcome, whether good, bad or indifferent!"

My wife and I were walking along the east side of Central Park on May 7th, heading to the Metropolitan Museum when we discovered the home of Henry Clay Frick and the Frick collection. We had limited time and were somewhat daunted by the thought of the Metropolitan Museum. The self-guided tour of the Frick collection was the perfect solution. He has a wonderful collection of paintings and sculptures by Old Mastersas well as period antique furniture pieces. We spent 2 hours taking in as much as we could before we had to leave. This was 2 hours well spent admiring the works of the various artists in his collection. The home that houses these masterpieces is amazing as well.I recommend this tour."

I lived near NYC for 6 years, but, always had a baby or toddler to look after and the Frick does not allow such young visitors. Therefore, I was never able to get there. I moved away, but, recently was able to visit with my mom without any of my kids. My top priority was to get to the Frick. We went and it was well worth the wait. The house itself is beautiful. I especially loved the library which has special leather mats across all the rows and rows of books to keep the dust off- clever guy that Frick! The art was amazing- as others have said, not a huge collection (I had just been to the Louvre, so I was tough to impress), but, very well-selected and well-maintained. There was no photography allowed in the galleries, but, I was able to take some nice pictures of my mother in the center courtyard which is a very nicely manicured mini garden. Fantastic gift shop with all manner of books and gifts for art lovers. Overall, it was a very pleasant use of an afternoon in Manhattan."

The paintings, sculptures, and porcelain in the Frick are all of very high quality. The three Vermeers make it particularly worthwhile, but there are lots of other splendid works. This time I revisited Holbein's Thomas Cromwell more than once, hard to resist while \"Wolf Hall\" is on stage and on TV."

Frick's collection includes many not-to-be missed masterpieces by the likes of Rembrandt, Turner, Whistler, Titian ,Ingres, Vermeer, etc. etc.. Paintings are scattered rather idiosyncratically, in a home-like fashion that adds to the charm, e.g. don't miss the little back room with the late Medieval/early Renaissance Italian works, stuck over near the furniture and frilly French chamber decorations. The Frick also sometimes has fantastic special exhibits. On the downside: admission is expensive, it's often overcrowded, and some staff members are not particularly friendly. Still - don't miss it."

However, he had the perspicacity to be an early investor in coke (necessary for the huge amounts of steel the Industrial revolution will require). This made him millionaire by the age of thirty. His business association with Andrew Carnegie increased even further his wealth, but brought him also a lot of grief: he is credited with a prompt and efficient breakup of the Homestead steel strike, which did not make him the Darling of labor. This, as well as his relationship with Carnegie going sour, convinced him to leave Pittsburgh (where his former house, Clayton, is a wonderful museum today, see separate review) and move to New York City. He purchased the entire block between 70-71st and Fifth & Madison and vowed to make Carnegie\u2019s mansion on 91st St \u201clook like a miner\u2019s shack\u201d. Already a collector of fine art, he hired Hastings (of New York Public Library fame) to design a Beaux Arts building and got personally involved with every step of the design and architecture of his future home. When he died, he left his mansion, his collection and a $15 million endowment for the museum to acquire future art.  Whether you like or not Mr. Frick\u2019s taste (portraits and landscapes), you will admire his mansion, its intricate woodwork details, the floors, the unobtrusiveness of books, the harmonious co-existence of paintings, decoration, architectural elements and sculptures. There is an introductory video in the Music room about the collection. Currently, there is also a short movie about the Coypel illustrations of Don Quixote and several of the tapestries created after those illustrations. Admission is $20, well worth it. Tuesday to Friday there is a docent talk at 1PM in the courtyard (the only place where photography is allowed)."

In many cases the Masterpieces are hung right next to each other so you barely have to move to see the next one. The Renaissance collection is wonderful, without travelling to Florence.Oh, and by the way you may want to look in on the Hans Holbein portrait of Sir Thomas More- I kept going back to view it several times on my visit.

Go first to the indoor garden, which is a calm respite from the noise and bustle of the city. It's classic design, beautiful plants and fountains are a wonder for the busy city. Then on to the galleries, where there are the best classic paintings around, all placed in a gorgeous home, with vases, urns and furniture complementing the spectacular paintings.

It's home turf for several long established and new galleries, so there are lots of reasons to wander and if you go, don't miss the Frick.It's an eclectic collection but it was the paintings that took my breath away along with the fact that it really does feel intimate, almost like visiting someone's home, albeit a very luxurious and exceptional one. And that's what it was in the first place. The whole collection is beautifully curated to maintain that intimate feel.If you do nothing else, find Renoir's La Promenade and the beautiful Vermeers.

He built this beautiful home in order to house it and have it as a museum eventually. Absolutely doesn't disappoint. My favourite museum in the city."

This is our first visit to the USA and this was our first museum visit of the trip. It was only 40 degrees fahrenheit outside but the welcome inside was colder than that. We had been looking forward to it and I had been telling my girls about Holbein, Turner and Vermeer. We are from the UK and so Holbein and Turner are particularly interesting for us because of how these works are so deeply entwined with our history. At the door the sign said that children under 10 are not permitted. We had never seen a rule like this before in any gallery so we were a bit bemused. Two of the girls are 14 and 12, and the third is 10 in May this year - next month. Assuming that the rule is there to avoid screaming toddlers, and anyway considering 10 is her closest birthday by far, we didn't think it would be a problem. Wrong! The problem wasn't just that they applied the rule, it was the way they did it. Children who are a little bit small for their age tend to be self-conscious about it. For a male security guard to look her up and down and loudly proclaim his disdain for her size and accuse my wife and I of lying to him in front of other visitors, was a terrible introduction to the United States for us. Children should be encouraged to think of fine art as something that is remote, snobbish and inaccessible. An impressionable young child will not forget an experience like this, and an institution like the Frick has a responsibility not to damage the image of the art world in this way. We never saw the collection, and I suppose we won't now."

Apart from the rude staff, it was just a big house, but in the grand scheme of things, as its on 5th Avenue it just looks out of place. I wouldn't stop the taxi to visit there if I was you.

They do not post any information about the works of art other than the artist name, perhaps the name of the subject. Why the lack of info? Hmmm, perhaps because they want to force you into paying for the audio tour - which by the way, is some archaic thing you have to hold up to your ear - no ear phones.We skipped the audio tour, refusing to be nicked and dimed. Front desk staffer was snooty as all get out - young woman who I think might be an intern. No welcome, no smile. Poor gal, maybe she was miserable at her job.The place could use a good airing out - the place was quite stuffy, stale air. I actually hated being there, could not stand to stay long enough to see everything there. It's a beautiful building, and I would have liked to enjoy it. Other friends of mine had raved and raved about it, so I finally said \"Fine\" and checked it out for myself.With all of the other art museums in NYC, I doubt I will be returning to this place again."

The Frick is another great gem of NYC...less crowded than the Met or Guggenheim, and easier to get around in since it was originally the Henry Clay Frick house. However, if the exhibition is a popular one (like an Impressionist everyone recognizes), prepare to stand in a long line that can snake around the block. I've almost loved to take friends here who have been to NYC many times, but never visited the Frick. It's very quiet, peaceful, and beautiful (but can get very busy on the weekends, so go during the week). I am always fascinated by the views of 5th Ave and Central Park, and try to imagine what it would have been like to actually live there. It should be noted that Frick's private collection should not be overshadowed by the house itself, which is it's own museum of sorts. A lot of the furniture and rooms have been preserved just as they were when Frick himself lived there. So if you can suspend your disbelief for just a few hours, you can almost picture yourself on a private tour somewhere in time."

The house was previously the home of the Frick family and houses their personal collection of art. Even if you are not an art fan, I would still recommend going to see the house as it is very well preserved and in excellent condition. It is a rare opportunity to see inside a upper east side mansion! I really enjoyed my visit. You get an audio guide with your entrance fee so that you can get information about each room and specific pieces of art. There is a coat check on entering the house and if you choose to keep your coat you must wear it all the way round. This rule is strictly enforced and there are a lot of staff to make sure you wear it! I didn't check mine due to the huge queue, but then was really hot while looking round. As well as the art, I really appreciated the house. It is beautiful and so grand, there is so much detail in the decor of the house. The rooms are huge and when you looked out of the windows you felt like Central Park was the back garden, it's so close! There is no photography allowed except for in the garden court where the fountain is. Again, this was strictly enforced. I was disappointed that the gardens are not open to the public, although you can see then through the railings from the street. The music room was closed during my visit due to a scheduled concert that evening, which was disappointing. It is a round room so I'm sure it would have been nice to see it. The film they usually show was also not being shown today either. There is a small gift shop, with the majority of stock actually relevant to the museum (mostly art books and postcards of the exhibits) which is often not the case at some museums! The staff were also very helpful. It took a little over an hour to go round the museum, which is not long if you pay the full admission price on a regular day. However, I would still recommend the museum to fellow NYC visitors."

The audio tour is highly recommended - I enjoyed that there was commentary for both the art and the room decor of the house, and I felt that the narratives given in the audio tour enhanced my enjoyment of each art piece. The best part of the Frick Collection is being able to enjoy someone's personal art collection in their own period home. It is truly a unique experience to know that the entire museum and it's art collection was once someone's own little (or not so little in the case of this mansion!) space in the world."

Two things to remember, children under 10 are not allowed, nor are large backpacks or suitcases which their cloak room will not take. And secondly The Frick Art Reference Library on 71st Street was started by Helen Clay Frick and contains reference books and over a million photographs of art works. Henry was curious about the artist he was collecting and his daughter obliged.

Certainly, there is the Met, but this is a more immediate experience in a more intimate setting with a much higher concentration of pure masterpieces set in a fin-de-siecle glamour of an upper East Side mansion. Frick, an industrialist who amassed this extraordinary and tasteful collection at the beginning of the 20th century, stipulated in his will that no painting was ever to leave the house, and so you will never NOT find a painting in its place because it's on loan elsewhere. The museum does close early (by 5pm daily) I believe, so check the website for hours of operation. A free audio guide comes with the ticket, and it is extremely useful and informative. The exhibits are numbered with a matching number in the audio guide narrative, so you can move from painting to painting in the order of preference and input the number of the painting into the audio guide to hear about it, thus leaving the pace and exploration of exhibit space completely up to the viewer.Although overwhelming in its greatness, the Frick is quite manageable in its size, so at the end of the day, you can enjoy that rare feeling of actually seeing most of the museum. It is also right across from Central Park, so depending on time of year, you may enjoy letting it all sink in as you rest your feet sitting under some trees."

At the corner of 70th St and Fifth Avenue, across the street from Central Park and a little over half a mile south of the Metropolitan Museum is a gem of a building meant to serve as both private residence and then museum. As a piece of art unto itself the building, set back from the avenue, looks exactly like what it was and now is, a showpiece of architectural elegance for its time and still so classical in execution that no container could better honor the treasures held inside.I enjoy museums and as a New Yorker I revel in the opportunities available to me, but the Frick stands apart. For starters, it is managable in size so that if you want to stroll leisurely through all of it you can do so in less than an hour including a little time for absorption sitting in the pool room (as I call it, not sure of its formal name) but if you would like to spend time really looking at what Rembrandt, or El Greco, or Whistler, not to mention JW Turner, or Vermeer (you can see that his missus got her earring back) were capable of, the Frick is the place for you. While you're there, try to imagine what that massive embedded pipe organ would sound like in the middle of the morning, or any other time for that matter. The place has something for everyone, from wall sized tapestries, wall covering cupid-filled tableau in baby blues and pink with gold trim (not my personal favorite) the library where heaven only knows what Mr Frick paid to have his books bound and then stashed but it is masterfully done and then on to the sculpture gallery where the daylight gleams upon the marble busts and figures. It's a respite in the heart of a busy and bustling city and it is the perfect place to catch your breath. In the meantime, go to frick.org for a preview."

Few of those remain because a few years before he died (in 1919) he hired an \"art expert\" who sold most of the Impressionists' works and purchased great masters (such as Rembrant, Goya, Reynolds, Raeburn, Vermeer, Turner, Hals, Hobbema, Constable, ElGrego, Valasques, de la Tour). The paintings are hung rooms which are still furnished as they were when he lived there. Among the treasures are (unfinished) murals from Madame Dubarry's chateau which adorn the walls of his wife's bedroom and some of the finest Bouchers in the world on the walls of Mrs. Frick's tea room and in a recess (Boucher's four seasons).-----There are comfortable couches in the main gallery, and the museum is seldom crowded.Mr. Joseph London"

(There is a short film detailing its history) I love the Monet snow scene, St Francis in the Wilderness is one of my favorite paintings and the Titan portrait \u2014 amazing. There are also objects d'art for those who are not into paintings and an indoor garden. This was his home. There is nothing that can compare to stepping into one of the small but vast galleries, whose moss green carpet, cushions your feet, and quiets the air, making the Turners, Veronese' and other works live in the space that they deserve. This is a place of timeless, that place where all art inhabits, but that we humans often forget, as so seldom is art surrounded by its own jewel of a building. Go and enjoy!"

This is one of the numerous grand mansions which used to line Fifth Avenue - one which survived - the others destroyed to make way for the elegant apartment buildings and skyscrapers of later years. The Frick Collection is a must-see for any visitor to New York City - I would always choose to visit this intimate, personal collection of art over any other in New York! Please do not miss it!"

The collection is comprised of European artworks amassed by Pittsburgh industrialist, Henry Clay Frick during the 19th and early 20th century. Today, you can view the full Frick Collection within the former Frick Residence building on 5th Ave. just across from Central Park. Here you can see important works by the European Old Masters as well as an impressive collection of sculptures, 18th century French furniture and porcelain amongst other impressive items. There is also a beautiful and peaceful garden court within the Frick residence and a music room where performance and lectures are held. The strengths of the Frick Collection are the European masterpieces which include fine works by Bellini, Lippi, El Greco, Vel\u00e1zquez, Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Van Dyke, Vermeer, Goya, Whistler, Boucher and Fragnard just to name a few. Part of your entry fee (US$20 per Adult, US$10 per student) includes an audio guide which is advisable to take. This helps explain most of the major art works on display. This can be very helpful if you are rusty on your art history. As well as the worldly collection of permanent works at the Frick Collection, there are temporary exhibitions that can be very much worth seeing as well. We had seen a Picasso exhibition back in 2011 that was enjoyable and we very much enjoyed the Masterpieces from the Scottish National Gallery exhibition which recently ended. In the end, if you are enjoy fine art, you will want to visit the Frick Collection. The entry fee is on the high end of the scale but this is probably one of the finest private collections of European art in the world so its worth seeing, even if you also intend to visit the much larger collection found at the nearby MET. If you are not as much of a fan of fine art but want to see European masterpieces during your trip to NYC, you might prefer to visit the MET instead. Here you can find a much larger and diverse collection and you have the ability to pay what you like to enter the museum. Tip: If you visit on Sundays (11-1pm) you can pay as you wish instead of the mandatory US$20 adult entrance fee. This makes the museum an excellent value for money experience if you can visit at this time. Note: Children under 10 are not permitted into the Frick Collection. Make sure you are aware of this before arriving with young children."

The sculptures are also impressive. My favorite were the petrified wood vases, GORGEOUS! Finally, worth the mention is the elaborately decorated oil lamp. Unfortunately pictures of the collection are prohibited, but that only means that you would have to ingrain the image of the piece of art into your mind, which science shows prolongs your memory of the experience over snapping a photo.

The collection is not limited to a particular period or style but rather represents a certain \"balance\" on the part of the collector. The Whistlers have a common theme as do the Vermeers. Both Holbeins, the meticulous rendering of St. Thomas More and the more sinister rendering of his persecutor Cranmer are on opposite ends of the fireplace. It is a gentle entry into the world of art if one is traveling with people who might not want the all-day slog of, say, the Metropolitan Museum. The home element adds interest and a sense of comfort.

It was worth the wait! The home itself it a work of art. Approaching its pristine upper eastside location on 5th and 70th along Central Park and entering the grand, pristine, residence that served as home to Henry Clay Frick evokes a sense of what it would have been like to be a person of wealth in the Gilded Age. Like other industrialists of his era, Frick amassed a vast personal fortune, and also had a civic and community sense about him, which may be why he willed his home, an architectural masterpiece by the highly popular and leading firm of the time, Carrere and Hastings, its furnishings and his massive personal art collection as a public museum. The art is displayed as Frick himself enjoyed it, not by period or by artist. Before opening as a museum the home underwent some alterations and enlargement to accommodate crowds, but the architectural integrity of the home was not sacrificed, the space was expanded and complimented the original home. The Garden Court, which is like a little sanctuary (indeed, the entire Frick Collection is) was not original to the home, but part of the 1930's expansion. . The collection abounds with masterpieces in each room and special exhibits. Practical info: Admission of $20 is well worth it! Sundays enter between 11am-1pm and you can pay what you will, but it is known to be a bit of a madhouse. There is a complimentary audio self tour so you can go at your own pace. Depending on how much detail you want you could allot 2-3 hours to thoroughly cover the tour. Only the downstairs is open to the public. FYI - Must check coats or keep them on the entire time.

Highlights for me were the Holbeins (Portraits of Moore and Cromwell) and the Rembrandt self portrait. And then the Vermeers and the Bronzino....enough already! Make sure you visit if you are in town. Don't know why I hadn't been before and I will be back. Its a glorious cultural oasis in the middle of the city."

An exquisite collection of European paintings, sculpture, furniture, decor viewed in an intimate setting of the Frick mansion (as opposed the city-block long Met Museum). Henry Frick had the money,but the daughter, Helen, guided the collection as the art history expert and philanthropist. She also set up the art reference library, which conducts important research and conservation of all major European art (note: movie \"Monument Men\"). You walk into each room and see works by the masters. There is one long room where you can view Rembrandt, Goya, Joshua Reynolds, J.W. Turner, etc. all at once. A round alcove holds several Whistler portraits. As a fan of British history, I could see closely the Hans Holbein portraits of Sir Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell, two history changers. Other must-sees: the inner courtyard, the Bouchard season paintings in the hallway, and an amazing French clock with moving figurines."

I love art museums in homes, so I was so excited to finally get over to the Frick. However, I think the overall visitor experience could use some work. The free audio tour is a great audio tour, however I found it hard to navigate my way through the collection, because some of the audio tour labels are small, clear and not in a uniform place, so it was hard to know where to find them and there seemed to be no organization as far as the numbering of stops went. I also think the map visitors are given is tiny and hard to read. My only other complaint is that at some point in my visit the garden court closed, but I was given no notice of this by staff, so I didn't get to even walk through, seems like that would be an easy enough thing to notify visitors about.Overall, I think the Frick is a brilliant collection and worth a visit. Even if just to see the More and Cromwell Holbeins, but it's the collection that makes it great, not the overall experience."

We saw Masterpieces from the Scottish National Gallery. An excellent audio tour is included in the admission price. Be sure to use it.

No children under 10. Entrance fee $20 for adults, discounts for students (with ID) and seniors.

What I liked most about this place after the fabulous collection on display, is that it is on the smaller side as museums go so it is very manageable. Certainly you can spend many hours there, but you can also see all of it in an hour if you have limited time.A nice touch is the portable audio device is included with your admission."

If you want to take advantage of this option, arrive by 12. A line forms. We arrived close to noon and the line was almost a block and 1/2 long. It took the hour for us to get to the point of paying. This is a private home that was built with the plan of turning it into a museum upon Frick's death. It is not huge and the lobby entry, coat drop off and ticket purchase areas are tight. If you do not check your coat, you will have to wear it the whole time you are in the museum. They do not tell you the audio tour is free. Signage on painting and sculpture are limited and the audio tour would have been nice to have. For $2.00 they sell a written description where the audio tour is given out.  In the back of the museum to the right of the garden/fountain they show a film on Frick, the collection and any visiting exhibits. The film is a good overview and worth watching.  The collection on display at the time of our visit included paintings, sculpture, furniture, silver and terra cotta sculpture. An excellent exhibit from the Scottish Museum was on display. I would allow 1-2 hours."

One of Clayton Frick's many Mansions, I understand this is not the really fancy one there is a really nice one, I believe in Pittsburgh, but then again it might be on Riverside Drive. He had so many!! A nice respite from the City. I always loved the collections in this museum, especially the Vermeers and ElGrecos. The sculptures have their own section now that they have opened another part of the house in the front, or something in that vein. The other detail of the house I loved architectually is the atrium in the middle of the mansion. If you are a student or an Educator as about discounts for the admission. But know this is a private museum, so don't expect them to let you in free, however I have gotten as much as 50% which is much. I don't know if this discount still exists since it is never adverstised, but it never hurts to ask."

Even so, we were glad to visit this incredible collection in what was built as the Frick's home. The architecture is amazing, the art collection is incredibly beautiful, and the furnishings add a wonderful dimension to the appeal of this special place. If you are in a wheelchair as I am, or disabled in some other way, be sure to go to the front of the line where there is a special needs entrance. One other person can accompany you. The elevator is small, and once upstairs you wait while the person with you buys your tickets. If you arrive between 11-1 pm on a Sunday, you pay any amount. Otherwise it is $20 per person -- and it is worth it! And oh, be sure to get the free audio guides. Most paintings have a number that you enter and then listen to an informative narrative. It is easy to do. Frick had a desire to \"reunite\" couples whose portraits had ended up in different places. These are something to see! He also liked paintings that seemed to radiate light. Wow! Many Dutch masterpieces were on display during our visit. I took several paintings home with me, on postcards, that is. The gift shop is small, but nice. And the courtyard with its flowers and fountains is a serene pace. I highly recommend the Frick Collection. I am so glad it was left for all to enjoy."

The house itself is also quite splendid. So, why the hesitation concerning that 5th star?Well, firstly it is quite small which makes it difficult to appreciate everything in the collection, especially when it is busy as was the case during Sunday's 'pay what you wish' session. Some of the labeling of items in glass cases was so discrete, presumably so as not to detract from the items being displayed, that it was actually hard to read. It is almost impossible not to draw comparisons with the Metropolitan Museum which is just a few short blocks away and where one can see so much more for a 'pay what you wish' admission charge 7 days a week instead of the usual $20 charge to enter the Frick.All that said it is a very fine collection very well presented. Do take time to watch the video which is informative without being unduly long and take time to appreciate the courtyard space."

Henry Clay Frick collected various artists such as Ver Meer, Rembrandt, Whistler, Monet, Titian, Botticelli, Hals, Van Dyke, Holbein and Turner to name just a few and displayed them in his lovely home on the upper East Side along with sculptures and exquisite furnishings. He designated his home to be a museum in his will. The Trust added a lovely entry way with a fountain and pool and flowers flanked by stone benches by enclosing a carriage way that ran from 70th to 71st Street. It's a lovely place to sit and enjoy the splash of the fountain. There are often visiting collections to see.

I particularly liked the people that worked there. As soon as you entered the man navigated us to the correct line and told everyone that if you had a coat you could check it or wear it. You were not allowed to carry it. I particularly liked this because at another museum we had not been told this when we entered and half way through our visit was very rudely told that we had to put our coats on. We also got the free audio tour and then spent almost two hours walking through the grounds. The home is lovely and the collection is varied and interesting.

Frick's taste in art was limited, perhaps, but what he collected was first-rate. This time there was a rewarding special show of ten works from the Scottish National Gallery.

It contains at least one art work of most every famous artist, it was mind blowing moving from room to room to see what had been assembled! The Gray Line bus tour guide could not believe we had been, we were the first she had encountered! Do not miss this!"

The Frick is my favorite museum because it is relatively small, with a great collection of diverse Western art (and furniture and clocks) and a relaxing atrium with fountain and green growing things. Unlike a larger museum, where there is always something new to see and where you can be overwhelmed by the size, in the Frick you can see and remember the pieces you like -- and, if you're like me, you go back and revisit them, seeing them anew and, like old friends, experiencing their familiarity and their end fascination of seeing something new or different each time. Just as Frick exercised his taste in choosing the works, I exercise mine in visiting -- I avoid the Gainsboroughs, the Fragonards, and the Sargents, which others love, and look at El Greco's Saint Jerome, flanked by Holbein's Thomas More and (the dastardly) Thomas Cromwell; I go to Salisbury Cathedral and to the Turners, and to the Polish Rider and an Ingres portrait of a woman.Their recent visiting shows -- Girl with a Pearl Earring, the current dozen masterpieces from the Scottish National Gallery -- are fun: new exhibits, but small enough to be manageable.Go to the Metropolitan, of course; but for a relaxing two hours in the company of great works of Western art, visit the Frick."

When you visit The Frick Collection, make sure to stop at the small theater near the rear of the building to watch the video about Henry Clay Frick\u2013how he made his fortune, why he built his mansion on 5th Avenue between 70th and 71st around 1915 to house his collection, and how the building was expanded after his wife's death.For a world-class museum, it feels almost intimate. Most of the pieces are exhibited in the rooms and in the style selected by Mr. Frick when the building served as his personal residence. the collection features many portraits, with a number of Gainsboroughs, Whistlers, and a rare Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington.When we visited last week, the special exhibition displayed10 works selected from the National Gallery of Scotland, several of which were on loan for the first time. Also, in recognition of the 300th anniversary of ElGreco's death, the three El Greco works that are part of the permanent collection were displayed together for the first time.If you want to visit that won't overwhelm you with its sheer size, The Frick Collection is a fine choice. You can easily view the entire collection in slightly over 2 hours."

Many consider it to be the best art collection in the City for several reasons: first, it is a small, intimate museum that can be completely enjoyed in about two hours; second, the permanent collection is the vision of one man, Henry Clay Frick, a Pittsburgh industrialist who moved to New York (which is what many men of wealth did once they made their fortunes elsewhere -- think Carnegie and Rockefeller for two); and finally, the collection is housed in the mansion Mr. Frick built on Fifth Avenue for his family, but also to display his art collection. In fact, many paintings are still hanging in the locations where Mr. Frick placed them. The point that this museum was also the home of a wealthy cannot be overlooked because it defines this whole collection, and says as much about the man as about the art. It is unique among NYC art museums in this regard and is well worth the time to visit it when you are in New York City. In my opinion, it is one museum not to be missed."

I took the advice of another poster and visited on a Sunday (11am-2pm) when entry is by donation (common in London BUT a rare thing in the city that thrives on \"making a buck!\". I wasn't disappointed. Being an ardent UK National Trust and English Heritage member it appealed both from historical interest and curiosity as to the individual I consequently researched on Wikipedia (do this before visiting it CERTAINLY adds to your interest).Located overlooking the lower eastern side of Central Park on 5th Avenue it's not a hugely imposing building but one of utter charm. Immediately on entering one gets an atmosphere not really common in NY attractions, one of a cosy home filled with warmth and homeliness. I was spellbound from the beginning and blown away by the absolute quality of the collection. Matisse, Degar, Monet to Holbein, they are all to be viewed, with the most stunning Singer Sergeant canvas I have viewed (the highlight of the collection and rightly featured on the front of their promotional brochure).After enjoying Mr Fricks house I felt I had to go visit \"Mr Carnegie's\" house which is further up 5th Avenue (read the story and you'll understand). It was sadly closed but being reopened as a design museum. I nevertheless enjoyed peeking at it and what made Mr Frick comment (in a book I subsequently read) that he was going to \"outdo\" him!!!This is a story of real American success for one of a pair of Scottish immigrants who acheived truly vast entrepreneurial wealth and success, in Fricks case near death assassination from his strike breaking stance (his communist killer was later deported after serving 14 years in the State Penitentiary) and humbling affection for his family. Do visit his home even if briefly assuming you have the time when visiting this huge City of great contrasts (extreme wealth and poverty!). ENJOY."

Also, if you do have a small backpack, you can carry it with you, but you can only carry it one shoulder and try to keep it from swinging around. The museum is small, but the works of art are wonderful. I like going when there are less people and I go to other rooms when one room is occupied by a tour group so I can hear the audio guide. Everything is on one floor, but with multiple rooms, you can spend a few hours there. Also, there are no real signs, but there are bathrooms in the little entrance ways between doors (ask one of the guards). There is a bigger bathroom with multiple stalls near the visitor's entrance area. Overall, I really enjoyed seeing all the work. The current temporary exhibit is works of art from the Scotland Museum. Definitely worth checking out. And if you need a break from all the luxury, the center courtyard with the fountains and quaint, little frogs are worth taking a rest on the benches."

It's very restful , a home rather than a museum and each piece of furniture and every painting has been chosen to complement each other and their surroundings. Hence Holbeins portraits of Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell, sworn enemies look at each other across the fire place. There are 3 exquisite Vermeers, 3 unusually subtle Turners, many Gainsboroughs, Reynolds and 2 Constables. There is a lovely cool atrium to sit and contemplate but no cafe!"

Built one hundred years ago by Henry Clay Frick as his home but also home for his very serious and ongoing art collection, the Frick Collection is a stunningly beautiful piece of architecture in one of the best locations in New York City, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 70th Street. The artwork is largely comprised of European paintings from Cimabue to Sargent, all beautifully presented. In the main gallery there were at least three Turners! The admission charge is high but if you go on Sunday between 11 and 1 you can pay whatever you please, but as a consequence that is a very busy time. The audio guides were free for our Sunday visit."

In the hallway/staircase, look out for the organ pipes and the built-in part-hidden keyboard located opposite.The varied artefacts are well presented and very accessible. Do use the audio phones - as the brief explanations given are very useful. Cost wise - On Sundays rather than charge their usual entrance fee, they simply request a discretionary contribution.

Our annual 'fall in NYC' trip--we lived there over twenty years, and I return to NY frequently on business during the year. 2014 was the year for The Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan, as always, in NY. But this was the first time (in my fading memory) for me at the Frick and the experience was perfect. First, unlike the Louvre or Met, this does not overwhelm: it is the private collection of one specific gilded age millionaire: Henry Clay Frick. The 'included' audio tour was, for my, the best of its kind as it allowed one to select specific art works for description--and the narrative (sounded like Philippe de Montebello) was studied and spot on. Most importantly, the narrative threaded the artworks and made them 'one of a whole'--why they were acquired by Frick--what he saw in each work--and how the whole fit into his life. If you, or members of your family, are otherwise reluctant art museum devotees, I would highly recommend the Frick in order to enhance your life."

            "review": "Hidden gem of an art museum. My wife and I love art museums and have visited a number of museums in a number of cities - including the MOMA and the Met in NYC. My wife had seen a review of the Frick Collection and was interested in visiting it. Before leaving for New York, we ran into a gentleman at a wedding reception who - when he hear we were heading to NY - started raving about the Frick and urging us not to miss it.The Frick Collection is actually housed in what had been the home of Henry Clay Frick which Frick had planned to become a museum after the passing of he and his wife.So -- part of the attraction is the setting in the old Frick estate and part of the attraction is the art. Frick and his wife amassed a wonderful collection of art and it's presented very well in the Frick Collection. Your admission price includes a free self-guided audio tour device which is nicer than most of these devices. The device allows you to key in the number of a specific piece of art and to learn about that particular piece. You don't know to tour the collection in any specific order when using the device.For art enthusiasts of any kind - the Frick Collection should be on your list."

Upon admission, you are given a device that explains each piece to you through a small speaker. It allows you to choose the pieces you are drawn to, and learn more about each piece.

You walk through the Frick family home, the dining room, the drawing room etc and look at their art works as they lived with them. While the home is stately you can imagine how it would be to live in it, having coffee in the library looking at the Turners and Constables. Then a port in front of the fire with the Holbein paintings of Thomas Moore and Cromwell on either side. I loved the window dressings, so opulent and reminiscent of Josephine's personal quarters at Fountainbleu.This is a treasure, not only for the collection but also for an insight into a family's life."

The Frick Collection offers a look at the opulent past of America and New York in particular during the height of the industrial revolution when barons the country's business. Obviously the works of art are fabulous to view, but what makes this collection unique is the manner in which they are displayed---in the home of the collector who came from very humble roots. Perhaps the only downside was the price $20 per adult, which Is a little steep when compared with other more extensive art offerings around the city. However, if you want the chance to really review a collection in depth, this may be the best choice for you. Furniture and other artifacts are part of the collection, and audio tours are included in the price of entry, as well as an introductory film and short videos on the current collections."

The museum is small enough to be viewed in an hour or so - and then you can go back to re-visit your favorite objects and artworks.This beautiful museum was once the home of Henry Clay Frick which was constructed between 1913-14. Mr. Frick had an eye for fine things and each object in the collection is of the best quality. There are representations from Europe's finest artists - splendid Turners, Holbeins, Goyas, Rembrandts, El Greco's, and not one, but two Vermeers. The collection is awesome. And the quality is so overwhelming, that it's easy to miss things. I had to ask a guard where the Duccio was located and went back to spend time with it. I was in heaven.No photographs in the museum except for the garden court. Bring glasses so that you can read the labels. Labels aren't the easiest to read. Free audio tour with admission."

Allow at least two hours, to really enjoy what is offered you should linger over the many beautiful pieces.It is small but everywhere you turn there is an exquisite painting or enamel or sculpture, a vase or a clock. We were there for about an hour and a half which is, in my opinion, the minimum time. A few notes. First, they have an audio tour available right after you pay and enter. I didn't use it but many people did. Second, there is a brief movie shown on the half-hour which is a good introduction. I would also read up on Henry Frick and the Collection before you go (especially his acquisitions from Morgan). Also, go to the website and see the virtual tour beforehand. Third, do not touch the tables with the bronzes. There are no ropes and I put my hand on the table to lean in for a closer look and a guard very politely asked me to move back. Finally, my mother uses a walker and was able to get around without a problem."

The garden adjacent is also open to the public, with statues and so on. The house--mansion, really--and the patio are beautiful, with art that competes with any museum. It is intimate and though there's no hurry and you can easily spend several hours there, you can also see it in an hour or two if you have a window of time and want to do a bit of museum'ing without getting your feet tired or your brain swimming with too much items. I wish more of the house was open to exhibits (only the ground floor is), but it is still a pretty impressive place. Right smack in the middle of Manhattan, on 5th Avenue, right across the street from Central Park, close to many good restaurants (on Madison but even more on Lexington a couple more blocks down). Been there several times over the years. Always great."

Once in, its 20 dollars, we went the other way round to have a few rooms to our selves.Fabulous collection, its unfair to pick any out but, two Holbeins of Moore and of Cramner, over a fire place, two Turner seascapes opposite each other, a room of Whistler...Its well worth a visit, its great"

The quality of the art here is outstanding and the variety is unexpectedly vast. I love the intimate atmosphere, you are actually visiting the original Frick mansion with the original furnishings and objects d'art. Highlights include the beautiful indoor atrium with a garden and fountain, the video of the history of the Frick Collection in the auditorium, and Fragnonard's \"Progress of Love\" drawing room. Also don't miss the Van Eyck oil in the first room and the Ingres portrait in one of the main drawing rooms. I spent a few hours in this museum and didn't want to leave! Look for the collection of clocks and timepieces in the house, they are truly one of a kind and very interesting to learn about. The Frick gift shop is a really great place for the art and history nerd in your life; you can find a book about almost anything art related. I love that the Frick is lesser known, which equates to less crowds. I also love that children under 10 are not admitted. Call me mean but I like to view my art in peace."

The two guards we spoke with were knowledgeable of the museum and one almost insisted we take the audio tour. We had previously breezed by the audio tour station thinking it was an additional expense. Most of the rooms have an assigned number. When you enter a room just type in the number and get an audio overview of the room. The works of art are also assigned a number, either individually or by collection. Type in the numbers you are interested in and hear a well written, informative and interesting description. We didn\u2019t have enough time, but if we did, I would have typed in every single room and art number into the audio tour device. It was that good."

It is kept in excellent order and in a home setting. The paintings are of the finest quality and the building almost like a Stately Home which in reality it is.The staff were both helpful and friendly and we had enjoyable chats with more than one. This helped to make our visit a very pleasant one. You can only take photos in the garden court with its statues, plants and water pools - exquisite. The shop is well stocked and has two guide books, one simply of the paintings, the other a different shape which shows more of the building etc. Mindful of the weight in my suitcase with the growing number of guide books from our trip to New York, I could not resist this one and will have much pleasure in savouring the visit. The collection is all on one floor with a short film in one of the rooms so you get a chance to sit down, there is seating in other rooms as well. The rest room is downstairs and there is a water fountain if you are thirsty just outside it. There is also a cloakroom to deposit your bags and coats which is free. There is no caf\u00e9 and therefore you will have to eat and drink elsewhere"

A tiny gallery, compared to the Met or MoMA, but a delightful space, with friendly staff and, because no-one is taking photos, an air of gentility and respect for the art which is glaringly lacking in the more iPhone-friendly museums.The audio guide was reasonable - but lacking in content, veering off into subjective and superfluous praise at times, rather than providing detailed historical context.A great find; the images of Cromwell and More glaring at one another across the fireplace, are not to be missed."

The Frick is an Upper East Side neighborhood art collection housed in the former mansion of the most successful and notorious Robber Baron of the late 19th century, Andrew Frick. Not a nice guy! Visitors have to use their imaginations to visualize that once Fifth Avenue was lined with elegant mansions for the rich from 55th to 86th street. Of course, the Andrew Carnegie's mansion is another one still left; it is now the Copper Hewitt Design Museum. Visitors can get the feeling of being one of the richest people in the world as they tour this collection. It is small, but worth seeing. There are several priceless works in the permanent collection, including a Vermeer, some Bouchers, and a few Goyas. Highly recommended not only for art lovers, but for seeing how the .001 % lived!"

My husband and I were really looking forward to visiting the Frick Collection, because of the architecture of the building as well as the artwork. However the visit was ruined by security officers shouting at visitors to stay on the carpet. However as the paintings had only small plaques on the actual paintings, you had to get up close to read the information. Not everyone wants an audio guide when wandering around. So if the information was larger, then perhaps people would not have to get close to the paintings. I was stood next to a chair, not even touching it and a female security officer shouted at me to move away from the chair. It completely ruined my visit. I think the security officers need to be more customer focused and help visitors enjoy the experience rather than trying to catch them doing things wrong."

I tried to explain that I thought it was part of the garden and that's why I took the photo. In the end, I said I was sorry, put away my camera and walked away. In the very next room, another black male security guard in a very loud voice, confronted me and said that when I was told to not take photos and I said \"NO\". THIS WAS A TOTAL LIE. Not only was it a lie but he said it so loud that those around me turned around and noticed me. I was really humiliated and extremely embarrassed. Meanwhile, the original female security guard wasn't there when he confronted me. She had already left the room. The security guards ruined my whole time here. I WILL NEVER COME BACK."

The people in the store don't answer the phone, and they don't keep the website updated as to what's available and what's sold out. Have been there when there was a docent giving a tour to some students and she seemed kind of dopey. You also have to go clicking all over their website to see their ticket prices and hours (Oy!).

The Frick Collection contains some of the very best works by European artists in the period from the middle ages up to the last century. Henry Clay Frick had the taste and discernment accompanied by the money to buy the best.Many of the paintings and sculptures in the collection are recognisable because they are in textbooks on their subjects. The quality is unique and uniform in its standard.The free audio guides are an indispensable aid as you wander through the Clay mansion and view his collection of major art works. The setting in his mansion just completes the experience. Best gallery in New York.No refreshments on site but just two blocks away at the corner with Lexington Avenue is a selection of excellent outlets.Get there for 10 am when it opens for a tranquil time to view the collection."

It was disappointing to find that where he parked his car was replaced by a fountain, that there was only main floor access, with no access to bedrooms or basement kitchen where his personal chef worked. Really it was an art collection being stored in a house. If I could chose again, I would go to the Intrepid museum instead."

Wish the upstairs had been available to see how the family actually lived, but was captivated by the amazing and wide range of art on display. I especially loved the Constable's 'Salisbury Cathedral' and Bronzino's 'Lodovico Capponi.'This had been on my bucket list of NYC attractions for the past five visits, so we made the Frick the top priority this go-round. However, it did dampen my ardor a bit to find that most, if not all, of the staff were very stand-offish, barely smiling or responding to greetings or questions. One exception was a gentleman in the library area who answered questions politely and gave us a genuine smile. We travel to NYC often, and find most people are extremely friendly and helpful. Not so at the Frick, unfortunately. The young man who helped me with my large purchase in the gift shop was especially frosty. I believe we would have stayed longer but just really were turned off by the rudeness of the staff. Overall, great assortment of varied artists, time periods and styles in a gorgeous setting that is impeccably presented. Just prepare to be treated with disdain and indifference by the large percentage of the employees there."

Numbers next to some items reveals more about it via the audio recorder.We started in Pittsburg at the Frick there and were so happy to see the rest of the story here.

Mostly portraits and landscapes but many are recognizable from art books and high school art classes. Make sure you pick up the free audioguide that is included in the price of admission. The staff don't tell you it's free and there are no signs that indicate that either so make sure you ask when you pay. Staff there not the friendliest or most helpful. Very rules based as well - no photographs at all and no getting within 1 foot of any of the pictures and sculptures. Personally, i can understand why - the artwork is priceless and needs to be protected. Most of it is displayed in the open and within reach.Lots to impress even for those with only a very minimal knowledge of art."

It also interesting to note that the place used to be Mr. Frick's house. It gives you an idea on how it is to live in a very luxurious lifestyle.

A glimpse into the life of one of the most successful industrialists in the history of our country and all the luxury that such a life entails. I got lost simply studying the various books that Frick had in his library. From an age where all your knowledge was collected through books (and not the internet!). Very interesting"

The Met has a larger, much more varied collection, displayed the way we are accustomed to seeing things displayed in a museum. The Frick Collection is comprised of almost exclusively European art displayed in much the same way it was when it was the Frick family home. We were amazed at the breadth and quality of the collection. It is much quieter and less crowded than the Met. Upon arriving you are given a handset (included in price of admission) that allows you to go through and choose which pieces of art you want to learn more about and which you just want to stroll by. Definitely worth doing."

The architecture and furniture surrounding you as you take in the paintings and sculpture on display are just as impressive and beautiful. I took advantage of the audio guides last time I visited and found them very illuminating---usually I find audio guides very dry and get bored listening to them, but I enjoyed the Frick's program thoroughly. There is a conservatory room at the center of the house that is a great place to sit and relax after walking the museum. They also have some great visiting exhibits, but beware of crowds. The line for the Dutch Masters exhibit (with Girl with a Pearl Earring) was around the block. The galleries were cramped and hot because of this. Seek out the Frick on an off day or off hour for the best viewing experience."

A beautiful, historic mansion containing the lovely art collection of the Industry Titan Henry Frick. 20 dollar admission except for Sundays. Worth every penny to see the great European Masters AND tour a home similar to the fantastic mansions of Newport. Sit and see the movie about Mr. Frick, his life, the construction of the mansion, and the art collection first. Get the audio phone and plug in the numbers next to the art or sculpture for its description. There are wooden stands behind the doors of most rooms and the stairwell that also has a number that describes the history of the room and how the Frick family used it. My favorite was Mrs. Frick's Boudoir and the sage green dining room overlooking Lexington Avenue and Central Park. Easily accesible using the Number 6 subway, get off at 68th Street-Hunter College stop. Immaculate bathroom on lower level. No restaurant but affordable cafe at pond at Central Park across the street if it is nice outside."

You do receive a free audio guide to use, but the descriptions are rather long and not to the point. I would rather have an explanatory card displayed near the piece itself describing the date, artist, subject, and one important feature to note, than have to dial in and wait for the audio file to start, then listen to someone ramble on about it for minutes. Also, I had to check a small plastic bag I had (fine, reasonable enough) and then saw people walking around with a purse and a backpack without anyone telling them to check it. A different guard came up and touched the strap of her purse on her shoulder telling her she could not wear her purse on her back over both her shoulders because it was then a back pack and had to be checked, while at that very same moment only a few feet away another woman had a similar setup and was wearing her purse as a backpack and he said nothing to her. We started counting, and by the time we left we had seen 9 women wearing their purses on their backs, and one with an actual backpack and a purse in the collection, drawing no correction from the guards. At $20 a person this was rather a rude way to be treated. So the collection and hall is worth seeing, but the descriptions and guards are substandard."

It gave a glimpse into not only his taste in art, but also his life. We loved the audio tour that gave us information about each piece - how he came to add it to his collection, techniques used by the artist, and some history about the age it was painted in. Wonderful to wander through this beautiful mansion at your own pace and drink in all it had to offer."

It is beautifully designed to take advantage of the space, with a beautiful atrium for contemplation and the staff is lovely. My only concern is a considered expansion, that I think will ruin the old home feel of the place. But don't let that stop you. Don't let anything stop you from enjoying the Frick"

Compared to the other big 3 museums this one is much smaller, having been the former residence of Mr. Frick. It is definitely much less overwhelming (can be comfortably visited in about an hour and a half), and is relatively off the usual tourist path. The only other museum I have been to that I would compare it to would be the Sorolla Museum in Madrid, although the Frick has much more variety. I would also suggest a visit before the (controversial) expansion occurs as it currently has a truly unique feel to it which may or may not be affected by the expansion."

As USA TODAY's First Road Warrior of the Year, I work a lot. But whenever I go somewhere for business, time permitting, I like to see at least some of the sights. This manageable collection of amazing art will provide you with an enriching afternoon. And be sure to save some time to spend in the spectacular Garden Court.

Stroll by works by Rembrandt, Tiziano, Corot, in an intimate setting, not overwhelming in size. Excellent programs offered - Summer Nights (free) are exceptional with talks, ballet performances, free sketch, etc. So nice to see so many young people taking advantage of these offerings. The Frick is doing a great job of making art accessible to the younger generation. Perfect location by Central Park at 70th street with a main entrance to the Park at 72nd street for those who want to combine a few hours of arts and culture with a row boat ride or fun with radio controlled sailboat or bike ride in the park afterwards.Pay what you wish between 11am and 1pm on Sundays and get a free audioguide in the front hall."

It gave additional life to the two books that British author (and twice Booker Prize winner) Hilary Mantel had written on his life and times, i.e. Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies"

There were staff present in each room to ensure that no one let their fingers do the walking across the artwork. The indoor garden/fountain room is a nice place to sit. Overall a nice place.The caveats: $20 adult / $10 student. This place is not big. $10 flat rate would be better. No photos allowed except in the garden room. The gift shop is eclectic but not practical. A big disappointment is that you cannot walk on the paths in the outside landscaped fenced in area. What's the point of having it if you are not able to enjoy it.

We were lucky, as besides the usual permanent collection of the Museum, there was a temporary exhibition of fantastic bronces of different periods, this itself made our visit worthwhile. We could also follow a film in the basement, explaining how the bronce sculptures are made, a well filmed explanation, which we found very instructivel. The gallery is divided into sections, more by themes than by chronological order. My favourites are the three Vermeers, a rare quantity for any museum, there are many pictures of British painters, a very attractive Corot and of course the portrait of the founder of this museum, Mr. Frick, whose original private house is the seat of this museum. The entrance fee of $ 20 ($ 15 for seniors) is a well spent amount for a cultural delight."

The Frick Collection, located on 5th avenue and 70th street, is a wonderful place for art aficiandos and some NYC history of the guilded age. The building is a wonderful place for architecture buffs but the private art collection is renowned for having some permanent paintings of note and temporary exhibits. The collection takes about 1-1.5 hours to see everything and contains works by Titian, Rembrandt, Holbein, as well as the famous Gilbert Stuart Portrait of George Washington. This is a very popular tourist destination so expect long lines and crowed, but not impossibly so, corridors and hallways. The collection appears to be expanding and changing over time so it's a good idea to visit every few years to see what's new. This is a wonderful place to visit and spend a few hours looking at some fantastic pieces of art in an intimate setting. It used to be free to enter (many years ago), then went to a \"recommended donation\" of $10.00; however, most recently required a $20.00 admission fee so the only negative I came across on my November 2013 visit. The gift shop is wonderful. Can be viewed as part of a stroll down 5th avenue toward Central Park and great shopping."

I opted for the audiobook since I had a couple of hours before closing and always enjoy hearing about each individual piece. It was GREAT idea because the audiophone allows you to type in the number of the work and provides a brief narrative about the artist, subject, technique, etc. I learned so much about the art and gained a better understanding of the varied and cohesive collection (art on the walls and architecture). I also saw a large group of people sketching so I signed up online to go two weeks from now (it's free!)."

Along with Mauritshuis in The Hague, the Frick ranks as my favorite art gallery. Why? Because every piece is a treasure, and the collection is small enough so that one is not overwhelmed, unlike the great art museums, including New York's Metropolitan. I hesitate to single out any of the great works, but I always swoon when I see Holbein's Thomas More and Oliver Cromwell, and Bellini's St. Francis. But there is something for everyone's taste, and this is an excellent introductory gallery for younger folk. Set in beautiful mansion, it's easy to enjoy both the artwork and the ambiance. "

I'm a huge fan of old mansions, so the house itself was really cool to see. Seeing the art displayed on the walls really added to the experience. I loved the audio tour (included in the admission price, which is rare. Most usually charge you extra). It gave a lot of interesting information not just on the composition of the art pieces but also how they were acquired, the history behind the items and also information on each room you were in and how it came to be or what it was used for. Another bonus, which I didn't realize until later, was how the art was never separated into periods. I can get bored looking at the same kind of art over and over again. I appreciated that the art at the Frick was all mixed together. It also gives you a good chance to compare the styles of various periods. I think this helps you to perceive a lot of the main features of each style by comparing it to other pieces."

The Frick Collection is a very intimate collection of wonderful works of art that can be admired and appreciated in two hours without feeling as if you've compromised.Beautifully displayed in the former residence of Henry Clay Frick and family, you can view works of art you thought were only accessible in Europe. You can closer to items than in many museums thought docents will caution you at times. The battles with other millionaires of his era make it more entertaining as you view the incredible Limoges enamels and superb 18th century furnishings that often came when JP Morgan's sons sold off many of his pieces. Check out the masterpiece from the \"Master of the Large Foreheads\" in the enamel collection that made us smile! You'll also see remarkable paintings by Turner, Valesquez, Rembrandt and more. It's nice that there are seats in several areas so that you can rest and enjoy them from a distance.Don't neglect the surroundings of the artworks - the audio tour is excellent and allows you to jump around from one item of interest to another without listening to the tape chronologically.And the audio tour is included in the entrance price for an adults of $20. Sundays offer a great special of paying what you wish between 11 AM and 1 PM which would be great for a family.The garden court is a peaceful oasis and intriguing as it was once a drive through and carport!We did not watch the history film in the music room but others said it provided a great perspective.So many museums are vast and overwhelming, but the Frick Collection is a fine jewel!"

The audio tour was very well done and as a bonus, a particular security personnel had some very interesting stories about the exhibit and art as well. Having been to almost all the major museums in NY, I can certainly say this one was very unique and offered up an astounding collection of art to enjoy!

The collection has some really wonderful works, such as the Hans Holbein portrait of Sir Thomas More, and the Fragonard room is a unique treasure in NYC; but as wonderful as the art is, the setting is even more interesting. The Frick mansion is an ideal setting for viewing art; it feels much more like the private home it once was than a typical museum, and the interior garden courtyard is the most wonderful part of the building. The fact that the collection is only a fraction of the size of the Metropolitan Museum's means that you can see the entire Frick collection in about an hour without rushing through. And they often mount really interesting special exhibitions as well. The Frick is a must-see for art lovers~!"

This beautiful home was purpose - built as Frick, who was interested in collecting great art, intended to leave his collection of sculptures, artwork and furniture to the public after his death. For this reason, the museum is small compared to others in the city and easily do-able in a couple of hours. Being in someone's previous home also adds to the charm and personality of the place. Just opposite Central Park, this museum is well worth a visit!!"

The paintings are lovely, yes, this is true, but when I consider the actual price compared to say, the Met museum, I don't think this museum is worth paying full price. Go to this museum on Sunday between 11 and 1 when you can pay what you like. People ahead of us in line were paying $1 for tickets. We bought 2 for $5. This seems to be more reasonable for what you actually are viewing. I'd start with the movie which is actually towards the END of the tour. This movie will help you better understand the pieces you are viewing. Then, I'd get the audio tour which may also help understand what you are seeing and why the paintings are so important. Overall, after having gone to the Met on numerous occasions, I think the Frick was a bit of a disappointment. You can pretty much see similar items (more and better quality) at the Met and they have a pay what you wish option all the time!"

I later found the basement bathroom.....All in all.....- No photos allowed- Small but quality collection- Small footprint- Upstairs closed to access- Very rude staff- Not very knowledgeable- Only 10 year olds and above allowed- If you have experienced other world class institutions then this might not be worth your time"

The museum is small but mighty, uncrowded, has free audio tours, and is very easy accessible as a result. More importantly the art in this house is of great significance and is displayed in the house the way it was when Frick owned the house. It is also set within architecture of great significance and grandeur. My favourite is Mrs Frick's sitting room which consists of a 18th Century whole room uplifted from a french chateaux complete with painted panels, parquet floors, and sevre vases. I also liked the fact that he reunited pairs of pictures so that you got a sense of the story of the artist. It is very eclectic so whatever your passion there is likely to be something astoundingly good."

There are artworks at the Frick that you will not be able to see anywhere else, as a stipulation in the will that created the collection is that the pieces may not be loaned out or sold off. Vermeers, Rembrandts, El Grecos and a beautiful setting make this a special treat for any art lover. No children under 10 allowed, not a place for the littles. The Frick lacks that industrial, high ceiling, echoing feel you get in some museums. It is a treat to wander through the former home of an art lover. We arrived at 11 on Sunday, which is pay what you will pricing day. We toured the entire museum at a leisurely pace, listening to about 75% of the audio descriptions available on the free audio guide. We feel we saw everything, we could have spent a little more time, but we had an appointment elsewhere so we left at 3. There is no photography of the collection allowed, which is a bummer, but there is a book that lists all the details of the works that was only $2 to purchase. We also picked up a full color book with the collection highlights for a reasonable price under $18 No food on site, eat before you go or when you leave. (We hit the hot dog cart one block down on the way out)The staff was nice. Many, many security guards. Keep in mind that they are trying to preserve the house, you might be gently reminded to stay on a carpet or not to touch a wall. there are sofas against the wall in the West gallery to rest weary tootsies, as well as seating in the Garden Court, the only place you are allowed to take photographs on the property. There were short films in the Music Room that told about the collection, as well as the special exhibit. Well worth the 12 minutes to get some of the history of the house and collection. And you can rest your weary tootsies while you sit and watch.We saw the Bronzes from the Hill Collection on exhibit when we were there, Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes From the Hill Collection at The Frick Collection, NYC, January 28, 2014 to June 15, 2014. Lovely, and an interesting quick video on a monitor that showed how bronzes are made using the lost-wax technique. There's also an exhibit at the Portico Gallery, a well-lit small gallery that was charming: Enlightenment and Beauty: Sculptures by Houdon and Clodion April 1, 2014 to April 5, 2015, an opportunity to see several sculptures from private collections in an atmosphere conducive to leisurely study. I absolutely fell in love with Hodon's \"Vestal\" - a sculpture I would never have seen otherwise, I feel fortunate to have visited the museum when we did."

The building and garden court are breathtaking.The collection is less interesting to me, except in the historical context of what a fabulously wealthy collector can do at a particular point in time, but really, whether or not you like the art is a matter of taste. If you are a Gainsborough fan you will love it!The audio tour is very well done."

Free audio guides keep you informed rather than lots of information boards as the Frick aims to be more like a home than a museum or gallery. Look out for the 'Pay what you like' slot which can save you lots of dollars. The only criticism is that there are very few places to sit down."

An exquisite collection of masterful old world paintings and other fine arts presented in the 5th Avenue mansion of the collector. A rare opportunity to tour a beautiful (but not ostentatious) mansion and enjoy the architecture in harmony with the art. The condition of the works and their presentation is pristine and yet approachable. The collection is also \"right sized.\". You can really see it in an hour or two. It is bountiful and diverse without becoming overwhelming. The personal audio devices offered are very worthwhile. A number for each room lets you hear the history and design of the room. Most works also have a number, so you can punch up more detail on all that interests you."

The Frick Collection is housed in the former home of Henry Clay Frick, who had the home built and furnished, and who collected the wonderful art throughout the building. The upper floor is not open to the public but the entire main floor is furnished as though the family were still in residence. As a result, a trip to the Frick is more than just the art on the walls, it is also a look at the antiques, the statuary, the wall coverings, fireplaces, bookcases, and a genuine peek into the home and grounds of the Frick family. The audio guide (free with paid admission) is really helpful when trying to learn about the various works and the rooms themselves. As previously stated, there are 3 Vermeers in the collection as well as originals by other well known artists. You could spend an entire day going through this vast home."

The collection is stunning, the quiet is soothing, the light is neither dazzling nor diminishing, and the staff is helpful and warm. There is no better museum in NYC, and if you go on Friday evening, entrance is free.

The art collection is a marvel and can very honestly compete and even beat some pieces at the nearby Met Museum. The great thing is that it has a smaller scale, so you can see everything in 1 or 2 hours.They also organize very cool exhibitions, and sometimes have concerts.Absolutely worth a visit!"

If you think you might possibly have an interest in European painting from the Renaissance to the 19th C, do not miss the home of Henry Clay Frick. There is no dross here. The free audio tour (punch in a number to hear about the works that interest you) calls Bellini's St. Francis in Ecstasy the most important Renaissance painting in America. It is certainly the most beautiful. It hangs between two superb Titian portraits, across the room from an El Greco and two mind-blowing Holbein portraits. There are only 3 dozen Vermeers in the world, but 3 very lovely ones are here, as well as works by Rembrandt (the fascinating Polish Rider), Hals, Van Eyck, and rarer, Van Dyck. The Veroneses are among his finest, painted for Emperor Rudolf II. Even if Rococo is not your thing, the four seasons by Boucher are charming, and the decorative cycle by Fragonard is his masterpiece. A tiny trompe-l'oeil by Liotard, an artist few people know, is a thing of rare beauty. The Georgian portraits are fantastic, including Gainsborough's image of prominent courtesan Dally the Tall and Hogarth's painting of a heavily bejeweled woman who preferred to annul her marriage & declare her offspring bastards rather than allow her wastrel husband to blow through her inheritance. There is a small but lovely exhibition of the sculpture of Houdon & Clodion right now as well as one on Renaissance and Baroque bronzes downstairs. And when you've seen everything, you can relax in the garden court and pretend to be a robber baron with exquisite taste."

The museum opens at 11 AM on Sunday and when I arrived a little before 11, the line went around the block. It moved fairly quickly and it took 15 minutes to get inside the building. Same great setting in Frick's mansion and wonderful art work but with the crowds of people it was somewhat of a chore to enjoy the museum. You can also get in for free if you are a member of one of the North American Reciprocal Museums (NARM)--the Frick participates so it might be wiser, if you have that membership, to visit some other day. Easy public transportation--bus and subway stops nearby and the beautiful Central Park right across the street."

Sure the collection might be a little heavy on English Portraiture, but viewing all the art in the way in which it was left in the sumptuous mansion across from Central Park is simply cool. I attended again during the \"Dutch Masters\" exhibition and saw several Vermeers and the famous Girl with the Pearl Earring. Perhaps even more astounding was the presence of the \"Goldfinch\" a tiny famous oil in the too real to be real style of that time.Get the audio tour, its worth it, and you'll hear little tidbits about how Frick made his selections and in some cases also why he placed them just so in his home. I like to end my visits in the garden atrium which is a later alternation to the property, but works fabulously for the gallery."

The collection isn't as large as some of the other well-known New York galleries and museums, but the experience of viewing the Frick's collection is second to none. For one thing, it's not as crowded and rushed as other place. The collection is stored in the former house of Henry Clay Frick, an industrialist from the turn of the last century. For those familiar with National Trust houses in the UK, it has a similar feel to some of those. Parts of the house were added on after Frick's death, but they don't seem out of place at all with the original sections. There's a free audio guide, and at least half of the paintings have an audio description, so it's well worth picking up. There's also a short movie that explains Frick's background and the house - I'd suggest viewing this before starting in on the collection, though the movie room is near the back of the house. If the $20 admission puts you off there is a pay-what-you-want time period Sundays from opening at 11am to 1pm. When I visited over Easter it wasn't busy at all during this period."

There is quite a mixture of art - paintings, scupture, bronzes, enamels, furniture, porcelain, and I'm sure I missed something. It is also worth watching the video and learning about Mr. Frick, and how the house was converted into a museum. As for the art, the Fragonard Panels are astonishing, and I loved the Gainsborough portraits.Afterwards, cross the street into Central Park and see the Bethesda Fountain, which is almost a straight shot across from the Museum."

The paintings are excellent from Fragonard's to Bronzino's and all in an immaculate setting. Maybe because everything seems as though Frick has only recently left, maybe because you can simply walk through the rooms, maybe because the paintings aren't arranged as in museum by school but have their own sense of place.This is one of the delights of NY and repays frequent visits"

The famous Vermeer was part of a larger exhibition of other Dutch masterpieces. We went on a Saturday afternoon so there was a bit of a wait. But we were prepared for the blustery weather so we didn't mind. The Frick was once a private residence, so even though it was an opulent home, you could still imagine people,living there. Along with the borrowed Dutch masters they also have a first-rate permanent collection. Visiting the Frick is a more intimate experience than the Met, so it's not so,overwhelming.

Not only is it a treasure trove of Western art, but one of those rare museums where you can look at art quietly, usually away from crowds and big groups. A wonderful place for contemplation, relaxation, and a true aesthetic experience. I find the staff to be a bit snooty here but that is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to see such masterpieces in this kind of environment. While MoMA and other big museums increasingly go for spectacle and shows that will draw in crowds and money, this place stands apart in valuing the artistic experienced, above all."

There are nevertheless very important works in the collection such as a remarkable self-portrait of Rembrandt and the two portraits of Sir Thomas Moore and Thomas Cromwell by Hans Holbein. The general admission is pricey ($20, luckily I am a student) and the museum visit can hardly last more than two hours. The free audio guides are, however a nice treat, but on occasion the audio commentary would make value judgments of the paintings rather than providing us with background information for us to judge the work ourselves. Also the museum felt more like a nostalgic tribute to aristocracies than a cultural pedagogic experience."

The collection is amazing. I had never heard of the Frick....but seeing that it got much better reviews than the Guggenheim thought I would give it a try. The 6 members of my family that went ages 14- 74 all loved it. The only thing that dissappointed me was that you are not allowed to photograph the art--which was truly awesome. Glad that his collection is open to the public..and at the time we were there Sundays were free (or an acceptable donation) no fixed price. I believe other days it was $20. Not crowded at all and a wonderful experience across from Central park East. Will be back!"

We enjoyed the bronze exhibit, but the truth is we returned mainly to once again see the three Vermeer's. There are only a few (estimated at maybe 35) authenticated Vermeer paintings in the world, and three are at the Frick. We saw one in Vienna and one in London recently but you have to travel to see them. The Frick former home is a lovely setting for a smallish but wonderful art collection. It is so much easier to enjoy a couple of hours here than at the Met for us. This time we also concentrated more on the other furnishings and objects rather than just on the European masters.There is a wonderful virtual tool on the the Frick website. Take a quick look to decide if this is for you.Also, for those who are worried about the admission price to this private museum, the do offer times with free admission. We went early on a Friday morning, and it was not busy. Watch also for guided tour times and lectures. We hope to attend one next visit."

This building and collection is all about the art and it's heritage, which as a visitor to the US made me breathe a sigh of relief and allowed me to appreciate the art's origins more. Frick clearly loved European design and art and had excellent taste. Even the rooms themselves are beautiful without the art within them, but the art and statues are incredibly good. TIP: There are pretty much no signs or explanations of anything so you must get the audio guide which explains mostly everything in the collection and whose explanations are engaging and interesting."

We visited the Frick during a time when the Hill collection of Renaissance and baroque bronze sculptures was on display downstairs. Spending time in that section alone was well worth the visit. Learning about 19th century industrialist Henry Clay Frick, his partnership with Andrew Carnegie, and his love of art, was fascinating. There's a short film on his life and his construction of a home which he apparently intended to become a museum upon his death, without ever expressing that intention to anyone.There are so many works of art and period furniture that one could not begin to list them in a brief review. From Jan van Eyck's Virgin and Child, with Saints and Donor to Rembrandt's self portrait, you can spend hours admiring the works of the Old World masters. We are told that on the weekends you should be there early because of the crowds that gather before opening time. We arrived 15 minutes before opening on a Tuesday morning and there were already 20 or so visitors awaiting entry. This is a grand place to spend up to a full day immersed in beautiful art and architecture."

It is a relatively small art collection, but that means you have time to concentrate on individual pieces (unlike the Met, say, where you're constantly hurrying through rooms). Every painting is worth seeing. The most perfect room for me was the 'Living Hall', which has six exquisitely beautiful works - two Titian portraits, Holbein's 'Thomas More' and 'Thomas Cromwell', El Greco's 'St Jerome' and Bellini's 'St Francis in the Desert'.You can easily spend two hours here without losing interest. The audioguide, included in the admission charge, is very informative and certainly worth getting.

The artworks themselves are a melange of styles with only a handful of true masterpieces (the Vermeers and the Fragonard room were the ones that stole my heart). What makes this collection really worth visiting is the way Frick himself combined these artworks and used them as a haven from his frenzied life.

The paintings are pleasing and the gallery feels like you have been invited to walk through Mr Frick's home rather than a gallery. Everything is beautiful and calming with pleasant and personal paintings all around you. No disturbing or challenging art, just honest to goodness beauty. I love it."

I was really excited to visit the Frick Collection after reading a brochure about it being a real mansion from the Gilded Age filled with priceless artistic treasures but I felt a bit let down from my experience there. Don't get me wrong: it is indeed a beautiful building and some of the art on display is amazing beyond words. I just felt a bit underwhelmed by the sparsely filled galleries and that the art on display was not always particularly impressive. I also don't understand why the Met allows picture taking when it has so much more on offer yet the Frick does not. I am glad I visited this museum, but I feel my visit to the Met was a much better investment of time and money."

You can easily spend a couple of days wandering through its immense collection. The Frick is much smaller, but every piece is a masterpiece. You will recognize most of the artists by name. They come from all periods and many different countries. Since it is a museum in a home, the decorative arts are also excellent and well displayed. Take the 4/5/6 train to the 68th street stop; go 2 blocks north and 2 blocks west over to 5th avenue. This museum is designed for those that have only enough time to fit in 2 or 3 hours."

The house was beautiful to stroll about for an hour or two and the video presentation provided interesting insight into the life of the 19th century wealthy American. The collection itself is largely portraiture and renaissance art which is great if you like that kind of thing. I enjoyed looking at the small collection of clocks and admiring the furniture placed around the museum all of which were beautifully presented and immaculately preserved. I give this an average rating as although the house is lovely to wander around, I thought that for the relatively short amount of time I spent there it would be quite an expensive trip at full price ($20). However, as a student the entry of $10 was far more reasonable, but at full price I would have been disappointed. Compared to other attractions in nyc (such as the Met) you definitely get more for your money elsewhere. From the reviews I did expect a little more.In summary, the house and collection are lovely if you have the money to spare, but I would choose to brave the enormity of the Met for a day (or more) instead."

A gem in NYC, nestled away on 5th Avenue not far from the Met.If you don't have time to go round the Met (which is as big as it is brilliant!) then the Frick is a very good alternative. Based on one floor and in only in a few rooms, there very few places in the world that hold as many masters in such a small area. Pictures are housed in a classic space (albeit the benefactors ex-home) they range from Whistler to Gainsborough to Rembrandt to Turner within a just a few steps. For those who like art, it is a true spectacle. For those not so keen, it is a great way to see the classics in a small space without surrendering too much of your time. For those with kids (over 10 I think it is) it is a great introduction for them without the inevitable boredom slipping in. At $20 it's a bargain."

The museum's own collection of Vermeer, Rembrandt and Hals paintings is equally outstanding, along with its wonderful Turner landscapes. One room that was particularly interesting was the collection of early French time pieces. While the staff working the Mauritshuis exhibit were harried and rude, almost to be expected considering the crowds (thought rudeness is never excusable), the ones working with the clocks and watches were friendly and clearly quite proud of the cool items on display. Many of the rooms in the museum were fun to explore in an effort to imagine what they were like when the Frick family lived there, especially the highly decorated nursery."

            "review": "An Exellent Collection in a Beautiful Setting. I had not been back to the Frick in over 30 years, so it was like seeing it for the first time. The collection represents a history of European painting housed in an elegant mansion. The best part is that you can easily see the entire collection in an hour and a half. We went during the Sunday morning \"pay as you wish\" entrance fees, so it was a bit crowded but not so much that it interfered with our enjoyment of the art works (and there was no wait to enter). The regular admission price is $20, which some may consider a bit steep, but when you consider the quality and range of the art works, it is worth it. All of the masters are here: Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hals, Titian, Gainsborough, El Greco, Goya, Boucher, Watteau, Turner, Constable and many others. For those (like me) who were disappointed to miss the recent show with Vermeer's \"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\" you can be comforted by the fact that the Frick has three Vermeers on permanent display, including \"Officer and Laughing Girl\" (which far exceeds \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" in my humble opinion). Mr. Frick didn't collect many Impressionists, so if you are looking for those, you will be disappointed, but the few Corots and the one Renoir and one Monet are very fine indeed. When we visited last weekend (January 26th), the room with the Whistlers was closed for an installation, but that did not detract from our enjoyment of the museum.The complimentary audio guide is highly recommended. Nearly each painting has a commentary on the audio guide, so you can stop and listen to excellent (but not interminable) commentary as often as you wish.In addition to the paintings, there are also bronze sculptures and decorative arts, such as furniture and porcelain vases and, at the moment, a special exhibit of clocks, on display.This was a very pleasant way to spend an hour and a half on a Sunday morning. You will probably have it all to yourself on a weekday. Highly recommended."

I was disappointed that the \"Girl with the Pearl Earring\" was no longer there - mix-up on my part with the dates I guess. Anyway, I as impressed with the house and the architecture, and there were many amazing pieces of art on display. I was disappointed that some areas of the house were temporarily closed for setting up a new exhibit, so I felt that I was not getting the full experience. So I'm glad I went during \"pay what you wish\" hours. Works by many of the greats are on display. The staff seemed a little overly surly to me, not friendly at all - they came across to me more like prison wardens & guards, though it must be trying to spend you day telling people \"no photos\". I don't really get the \"no photo\" rules, particularly given that just about everybody these days has a camera on their cell phone, and despite the rule, many photos were taken. But I digress - the museum was nice, and the house & architecture are as impressive as the art work. An hour and a half was plenty of time for my visit."

I was very impressed by the choices he and his advisors made in selecting the works for his home, particularly the 17th-19th century works. Awesome.

We wanted to see the Dutch Masters of the Mauritshuis, including the Girl With The Pearl Earring, before the exhibit was closed. We had seen the Girl With The Pearl Earring twice before when it was on tour in the USA. The problem was that we could only visit on a weekend (and there were only 2 weekends remaining) and all of the timed tickets were sold out. We discovered that timed tickets were not necessary if you had a membership. We decided to bite the bullet and purchase an annual membership....essentially 3 times the cost of an individual ticket on a per person basis. The museum last Saturday opened at 10am. We arrived, after driving over 100 miles, at 9:50am. The line for the timed tickets was about two blocks long. The line for those with a membership....less than 1/2 block long. By 10:10am, we were actually inside. We spent the next 90 minutes in the two galleries of the paintings from the Mauritshuis. We spent close to twenty minutes just admiring the Girl With The Pearl Earring, and noticed a few details that we had forgotten. I liked EVERY PAINTING in these two galleries! When our viewing of the Mauritshuis paintings concluded, we decided to see the rest of the museum. We did not leave until 3:30pm (non-stop). We were pleasingly tired by then, and felt that we had accomplished something great. The remaining pieces in the Frick blew us away. Titian, El Greco, Goya, Holbein, Vermeer, Rembrandt, Turner, Renoir, Bellini, Cimabue, Martini, and Hals to name a few. What a world-class gem this is!!!! We expect to return when the crowds are back to normal. We expect to talk about this journey for years to come."

We walked into the exhibition at about 10.10am.Once inside you are ushered to get tickets ($20 adults, $10 students) and then shown the way directly to the Mauritshuis exhibition which is shown in two beautifully laid out rooms. The star exhibits are Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Goldfinch (courtesy of Donna Tartt's recently released novel of the same name). The Vermeer is in its own room and is absolutely stunning. The Dutch Mona Lisa. This is a very small exhibition so once you've seen that then you must continue on to the rest of the amazing collection in the Frick. Turners, Gainsboroughs, Constables, Hans Holbien, three more Vermeers, Renoir, Monet - the list goes on - all in a beautiful turn of the century mansion.You cannot miss this on your visit to NYC."

The spare collection of Hals, Rembrandt and Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring on exhibition at the Frick Collection by itself is compelling but perhaps a bit underwhelming after waiting in line for over an hour outside in the freezing cold. The real genius of the exhibit is the kinship between the Mauritshuis collection and the Frick permanent collection. The Mauritshuis works offer the perfect complement which allows the permanent collection of Dutch art, including TWO incredible Vermeers, to shine.The Frick itself is one of New York's greatest art museums, but that is not the only reason why it is unique. The mansion itself is one of the only ones left of its kind: those constructed by Gilded Age millionaires who sought to emulate the European aristocrats of the ancien regime. The result is a collection of art on par with that of a European great home, curated and displayed as the Fricks would have done while living in their extravagant home with its imported boiserie and grandfather clocks. And it is home to one of the most incredible portraits: Holbein's Sir Thomas More.If you are visiting the Met: why not pay a visit to the Frick? It's just down the street!"

The Frick Collection is the perfect collection to see in New York City for the most inexperienced to the most knowledgeable visitor with two hours to spare in a busy schedule. Try to take the time to view the informative film in the music room before viewing the extraordinary collection as you will appreciate the collector, Henry Clay Frick, and what makes this collection so special, even more. Over the years, I have taken many friends to the Frick on their first visit to the city. All, without exception, have told me that it was, by far, their favorite museum experience. There is something very special about the fact that this was the Frick home. In addition to the extraordinary collections, the peaceful atmosphere and decor offers insight to another time. On Sundays, you can pay what you wish from 11 AM - 1 PM. On my most recent visit, I purchased my ticket online and am glad that I did so I didn't have to waste time waiting in line when I got there... I find that when I go to the Frick during my all too few, very short, self-imposed breaks on my annual business trips to NYC, the rest of my time in the city is much less stressful. If you haven't been, go; if you have and went when it crowded, go earlier in the day. It is that special and definitely worth it."

The Frick Collection is recognized as a premier museum and is well known for it's extensive collection of Old Master paintings and many examples of European sculpture and decorative arts. It was assembled by Pittsburgh industrialist Henry Frick and is housed in his family's former residence on 5th Ave. It is a tranquil setting for visitors to experience masterpieces such as Bellini, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Goya and Whistler, quite a departure from large, crowded museums. The grounds and gardens are beautiful as well, and it was great to see fantastic art in this Golden Age Mansion from a former time!"

Those who pre-purchased their tickets online could bypass the queue and enter as those left. A better system would have been to make those people still wait but only for 1/2 the time that those in the regular queue had waited.The collection did not disappointed. Unfortunately my time in the queue evaporated some of the time I had hoped to use in viewing the collection. The traveling collection did have blurbs and descriptions with the paintings but the permanent collection did not which resulted in me buying a book from their store to learn more about the paintings.If you do plan to visit, don't be silly like me and buy your ticket online and print it out before you go."

Another tip is to use the toilet before you go as there are only 3 ladies toilets which is ridiculous with people queuing for over half an hour, something the Frick need to look at.Ensure you get the commentary headset as they are the best ones I have every used. Each picture, room, bronze, clock is labelled and you can go round and put the number in and listen at your own pace and for the items you want to hear about. This also means there is not great queues at the same picture.The Girl with the Pearl Earring was amazing as was the clock room. It was definitely the best thing we did in NY."

The membership cost is not much more than the cost of tickets for the exhibit and you'll be supporting a lovely institution.The Frick is NOT for families with young kids - they do not admit kids under 10.

Time estimates given were grossly inaccurate (told 30 -45 minutes on the phone). Provisions should have been made for indoor waiting or outside heat lamps should have been provided. A displayed sign invited cold, frustrated guests to buy a Museum Membership for immediate entry. Many who could afford to buy the membership on the spot chose to do so and end their misery. Timed tickets (used at other large Art Museums around the country) would have helped with capacity issues and guests could have enjoyed other offerings as they awaited their time to view the main exhibit or arrived at the appointed time.

Their are many highlights and strengths: 17th Century Dutch painting, including three Vermeers, numerous Rembrandts, and other Dutch masters; wonderful 18th and 19th century British and French works, and many other delights.

It is nothing like the big museums, being the private house (albeit huge) of Henry Clay Frick, with his collection of European art.He was well advised (as well as very rich!) the quality is outstanding. There are three Vermeers for example, out of only 35 extant in the whole world and not counting the one visiting at present - well worth a visit to see those alone. They are not alone, of course, there are other Dutch masters, a magnificent Bronzino, a couple of notable Constables and some lovely Gainsborough portraits, and much more.We booked for the Dutch visiting exhibition and found that that meant we did not have to queue, and that entry to the permanent collection was included.Brilliant!"

The girl with the pearl was in a special exhibit and it was very crowded. The movie was mainly about Frick's life and said very little about his interest in art although you have to wonder why anyone would build a museum to live in as his home. The collection was varied and there was a special exhibit of clocks in another room. The staff/security were pleasant even when I accidentally ventured off the carpet. I don't recommend going on Sunday from 11-1 as it was too crowded and difficult to actually view the art. I would visit on a different day and get the headphones if I came again."

I had not expected to see Girl With the Pearl Earring (which my daughter had written about for her art thesis) but it was a lovely surprise. We went on recommendation of Frick being a bit \"different\". The internal \"garden\" area was lovely and we took time to take in the film explaining all about Frick and the building of the house....I guess that cost us a little time in looking around so we had less time to spend looking at all the original art. It is quite amazing to be able walk from room to room with all those famous artists pieces just hanging there, alongside lovely furniture, lamps, wall hangings etc. A lovely place - going late in the day was our own mistake....maybe it was less crowded that way. I would recommend it and I would imagine that restless teenagers or children would probably especially enjoy it. Less stuffy than an art gallery where all the art is practically in rows of similar - here it is all mixed up and you get some great surprises as you go round! Loved it!"

Thing is, none of the pieces are worth writing home about. So, off we go... only to find a line. Turns out the Girl with a pearl earring is on display. Well, cool! Oh, and when you hand in your ticket for the exhibit, this means you can't go back in for a second viewing on your way out. Okay... And as we're admiring the other works in this special exhibit we're witness to a security guard telling a woman she's wearing her purse/backpack in such a way as to make them worried. She points to another guard who told her a completely different story about how she's to wear it and that she was only doing what she was told. Ultimately they wanted her to wear it on her back with her coat over it. Moving on, I left my party to use the 3 stall ladies' room. It was a skillion degrees with a massive line. I took off my coat. Upon returning to the museum I was told to either check or put my coat back on. I couldn't walk around with it over my arm.In waiting for my party to return from the ladies' room, I had the misfortune to hear the woman at the member's desk explain to the woman who wanted to become a member that while yes, she would get in for free, her membership didn't include any guest passes and her friend would have to pay.Seriously???I couldn't get out of there fast enough.

The courtyard (formerly the driveway!) at the center is so serene and beautifully proportioned, you can feel its quiet beauty slow your pulse. The current Vermeer exhibit is a must see."

I'd never been to The Frick Museum, and we took the opportunity to visit because of the Dutch Masters exhibit highlighted by Vermeer's The Girl with the Pearl Earring. (I like it better than the Mona Lisa). The Frick is an old & stately early 20th Century mansion that was turned into a museum in 1935. The rooms are full of Frick's collection of paintings, sculpture, furniture, etc.--all in a homey setting of the super-rich from a by-gone era. I would love to know about how the rooms were used in Frick's day. The museum is not so vast as most, and one could easily see everything in an hour or two. Still, it would have been nice to have more places to sit down, especially in the galleries. My husband, who complains of \"museum legs,\" wanted to rest a bit, and there were few places available. We'll be back."

The architecture of the mansion is itself a work of art and I truly encourage visitors to sit and watch the relatively short video the museum plays on rotation that dives into the building and additions made throughout the years. It's a unique experience because the collection is so eclectic and impressive that you know you are in a museum, but there is still a feeling of being in someone's home that makes the entire trip through the various rooms more intimate and real. I highly recommend for anyone visiting NYC! Students get a discounted rate as well!"

The Frick Collection is one of the gems of New York City art museums, with a permanent collection that ranges from Duccio to the Impressionists with particularly rich holdings from the 18th century. Like the Morgan Library, the Frick conveys a real sense of its founder's passion for art. The experience of viewing the collection conveys something of the intimacy one would have experienced seeing the collection when it was a private home. The Fragonard and Boucher rooms are wonderful examples of the Rococo, and the portraits by Reynolds, Gainsborough and their contemporaries are top notch. At the moment, there is a small but choice special exhibit of work from the Mauritshuis in the Netherlands - the centerpiece is \"Girl with a Pear Earring\" (c. 1665). It is worth braving the crowds to see this lovely painting with its spontaneous expression and wonderful handling of light. The 14 other works in the special show are by Hals, Rembrandt, Steen and their contemporaries from the Golden Age of Dutch art (which was the 17th century, just when the Dutch were flourishing in New Amsterdam). The Frick has three other Vermeers and additional works by Hals and Rembrandt in the permanent collection's West Gallery.This museum should be a \"must visit\" on every art lover's New York itinerary."

The lines around the block waiting for admission make it clear that the Dutch Masters on display at the Frick are a big deal indeed. While the Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis in The Hague is closed for renovations, 15 paintings, including some by Vermeer, Rembrandt and Hals, are on global tour, stopping until January 19, 2014 at the Frick.The Dutch Masters are splendid, of course. Did you anything expect less? What's awful is how badly the exhibit is managed. (It was open almost a month when we visited.) Tickets are timed, but the exhibit, which is housed in the smallish WWI-era mansion built by Henry Clay Frick, was crammed to the draperies.The number of visitors may have been legal, but permitting so many at once is a crime.The star of the show is Vermeer's \"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\" which is showcased in the Frick's Oval Room. The other Mauritshuis paintings are on exhibit in the East Gallery, adjacent to the Oval Room on the right. Three of the Frick's own Vermeers are housed, with the permanent collection, in the West Gallery, off to the left of the Oval Room. Sounds dandy, but you can't get to the West Gallery from the East and vice versa without a block-long trek through crowded mansion hallways displaying other parts of the Collection.What made this exhibit even more difficult were the absurd curatorial placards. Made with relatively dark backgrounds, to match the wall-color, they had lettering in the same color family, just a bit darker. Tweaking the absurdity, the placards were printed in a small typeface, legible only at close range. Reading aides required.You would think the Frick, which has been open for nearly a century, would have learned by now to serve the public first and itself afterward. But until they get it, try to visit at off-off-peak times -- we went on a Sunday morning -- bring comfortable walking shoes, and take the audio tour, or bring field glasses."

I got there extra early, which was a good thing because I was only third in line to get untamed ticket when they opened their doors. The whole exhibit was spectacular and then of course I viewed their regular collection which was just as wonderful as before. Go before the exhibit is over, it is worth it.Note: The Girl With the Pearl Earring is smaller than you expected it to be."

But, there weren't many other Vermeers that are not in the permanent collection - which is superb - so that was a disappointment. Also the security staff have a thing about anyone carrying a coat, which was quite strange. They didn't suggest that you had to use the cloakroom, but if you hadn't they insisted that it had to be thrown around the shoulders. Either clearer signposting or a more relaxed attitude.

The artwork on exhibit (including paintings, sculpture, clocks, silver, etc.) is first rate. They featured a Vermeer, Hals, Rembrandt exhibit---Dutch painters---which was stunning.

The other day I went to see Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Hals - Dutch Masterpieces from The Mauritshuis for a morning that raised my spirits. The 15 paintings in this loan exhibition included the famed Girl with a Pearl Earring by Vermeer, more stunning face-to-face than in any reproduction I've seen. In a separate gallery were two formal full-length portraits by Hals which surprised me, being more familiar with his earthier work; there were a number of small-scale landscape and genre paintings by other 17th C Dutch masters, each a pleasure to view, and a wall of little-known Rembrandts. A fantastic treat. In the decorative arts gallery were antique French sculptural clocks from the permanent collection, each amazing and beautiful. The other galleries have unchanging displays of furniture, decorative arts, and great paintings from Medieval through Goya, Ingres, Corot, and Degas. The Vermeers are priceless. There is a small auditorium for occasional concerts, a small gift shop, an interior fountain garden, a landscaped lawn facing Fifth Avenue which can be viewed from the interior or the sidewalk, and an inner courtyard garden facing East 70th Street which can be viewed from the inside or the sidewalk. Downstairs are several rooms for temporary exhibitions, usually of classical drawings."

Timed tickets are sold and while the exhibit was busy, we didn't feel that it was overly congested for viewing. The Frick itself is a gorgeous building harking back to the Gilded Age of Robber Barons. And it has an unbeatable location on the Upper East Side near Central Park. We took the # 6 subway uptown from Grand Central and stopped for lunch on 74th St. at Cucina Vivolo. Simple, fresh salads and paninis at very reasonable prices had all five of us happy. One issue with the exhibit: we and others of a certain age had to stand almost on top of the descriptive signage because both the colors (artsy, but poor contrast) and font are not senior-friendly. Hope that the presumably young curator(s) takes note.After visiting the museum, we enjoyed a leisurely walk south to our midtown Bolt Bus. Right down Fifth Avenue to Bryant Park where the Winter Village shops are set up and we enjoyed a snack and excellent people watching."

The short film on the history of the Frick is worth the time. We found ourselves not just admiring the collection itself but contemplating the placement of the art works from the psychological perspective of Frick. The juxtapositions surely are grist for the mental mill. Plan on at least two hours but three would be a good start. We are going back on our next visit. Frick staff did not permit photos.

The day I went was a bit cold and we had to wait outside for about half an hour. Some people skip the line either because they were members or could become members on the spot! I'm not a local, so becoming a member was out of question. I waited. Others went on straight because they had bought the ticket previously. However, I had the impression that more people could skip the line simply by joining in the gathering of people walking to the entrance door. When I was inside, a couple appeared behid me, but they weren't in the line outside! Once you're inside, the process for buying is a bit slow. The line doesn't move on fast (too few staff selling?) Inside, there was a temporary ehibition, but it was confusing. They don't make it clear like showing arrows for visitors to follow a circuit. Another drawback is labeling. Some labels are so small (and on the frame) that you have to get really close to read. I saw some visitors almost touching the paintings! The good points are: The fact that it's a house ( a mansion, in fact), it features a splendid collection, the decoration, the furniture, the building, everything is beatiful! It\u00b4s a pity that the top floor is closed. The most impressive work of art to me was The Promenade, by Renoir. Still, it was a bit expensive. Larger museums in the world and in New York, display many more items for about the same price."

In fact you cannot take photos here. But their version of Constable's Salisbury Cathedral or El Greco's St Jerome are far finer than the Met's. If you go to only one gallery in New York, make it the Frick"

            "review": "15 paintings from Mauritshuis visit The Frick in Fall, 2013. The Frick is always a wonderful art experience, with a medium-sized collection of \"only\" masterpieces. For a few months, they are featuring a visiting exposition from the Netherlands, while the Mauritshuis museum is being renovated. The big draw is Vermeer's \"Girl With A Pearl Earring\", but all of the visiting works are landmarks of the history of art. It runs until January 19, 2014.During this show, the Frick is selling advance, timed tickets on Telecharge (wearing charity lipstick ... ), with the usual extra fee. There's no fee at the Museum desk ($20 adults), but they also don't guarantee that you'll be admitted immediately without a timed ticket. When I entered on 10/22/13, there was no line on the street, but when I left at Noon, they had started a line (with ropes) going towards Fifth Avenue. The entrance is on East 70th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues. They expect this show to sell heavily, so I recommend reserving and buying in advance, although I hate paying Telecharge/Shubert Ticketing for the privilege.Members and reciprocal members go to the \"Membership\" desk that's to your left as soon as you pass the checkroom desk. People who printed out their Telecharge tickets in advance go directly to the ticket-takers, who are at the head of a hallway just to the right of the \"Membership\" desk. People buying a new ticket get in the same roped line they always have, on the windowed, long-dimension side of the big lobby.To control crowds, ropes have been put up, especially around the Garden Court. You /cannot/ go from the West Gallery into the Oval Gallery, which is where the visiting exhibition starts, with the Vermeer. The other 14 paintings are in the East Gallery, where the Goyas usually are. (\"The Forge\" is temporarily in the West Gallery, along with all three of the Frick's Vermeers. This is a jarring change for Frick regulars!)So if you want to start with the Mauritshuis show, skip the stairs down to the Pierre-Jean David d'Angers show in the downstairs gallery (one of these is closed, no doubt as a lounge for the extra guards!) and take the third right (shop, small gallery, Garden Court) into the end of the Garden Court. Bear left to the entrance ropes. (There were NO SIGNS on the first day of the show.)This is a good exhibition. (Note that no museum, INCLUDING the Frick, allows photography of borrowed works. No photos.) But for someone who might eventually get to the Mauritshuis in The Hague, it's a little thin compared to the 100 works they showed across town (The Hague, that is) in the Gemeentmuseum. So you'll miss Vermeer's \"View of Delft\", Paulus Potter's \"The Bull\", and Rembrandt's \"The anatomy lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp\". (The latter is of special interest to those who like Thomas Eakins' medical portraits in Philadelphia.)By the way, the Syracuse University Palitz Gallery (11 East 61st) is showing a group of Netherlands etchings, including many Rembrandts that makes a good companion to the Frick show. The Palitz show runs until November 14, 2013 .There is a very funny 1981 parody of Potter's \"The Bull\" in Gallery 915 of the Metropolitan Museum of Art right now. Anyone going to this Frick show will want to see the Met's Vermeers too."

The Frick is a great opportunity to understand the history of Fifth Avenue as the home to many of the great 19th Century houses and families..."

The Museum gives you a free audio guide with your admission and it is a great asset to the museum goer. I also took a 15 minute tour and watched the film. I had been to the Frick many times over the years but this time by choice, it was the only museum I visited on this trip. Good choice. I went away delighted and not overwhelmed."

Last February my husband surprised me for our 40th wedding anniversary and booked a wonderful hotel to stay at for a long weekend. We've toured so many places in Europe,the US and cruised the Caribbean but we were never tourists in NY. It was so wonderful to have this opportunity to see through the eyes of a tourist how wonderful this city so close to me really is. And going to the Frick mansion and seeing the wonderful art works is really a great treat. Besides the wonderful collection of art, the mansion itself is a wonderful insight into another era of how the wealthy lived and the opulence of the time. It's right across from Central Park on 5th avenue. So treat yourself and go fantasize about living there, the lavish life style and picture yourself living among all the wonderful art"

Now yours to enjoy! Small enough to see within 1-2 hours if you're pressed for time, but rich enough in depth and scope if you have the time to linger at length in each of the beautifully appointed rooms. There's nothing quite like entering a beautiful old room and not knowing whether to first look at the carved wood paneling, admire the floor coverings, study the paintings, check out the Chinese vases, notice the statues and clocks, or look at the lovely antique furniture! We went on a Sunday between 11-1 when you can pay what you think is fair. Just off Fifth Ave in the museum mile near Central Park, it is well signposted with helpful staff. You will need to check large bags etc in the cloakroom, and there's wheelchairs available if you need mobility assistance. All rooms are on the ground floor and the restrooms are accessed below stairs.

(As my husband said, \"that Renoir was the perfect choice for the empty wall by the staircase.\"). Because the paintings were essentially the centerpiece of the mansion's decor, they are not all arranged by genre, artist, period, etc. So don't give up after you've seen the two Vermeers in the hallway (opposite the Renoir)...there's another one in another room (3 Vermeers! Holy cow!). (The exception is the watch and clock hallway.) The Frick is walking distance from the Met, but it is not as heavily trafficked, and is therefore much quieter (great!). A comprehensive and surprising collection--if possible, study up on what's there before you go so you don't inadvertently miss anything (due to the way the paintings are arranged). I didn't have children along, but I believe the Frick is not open to small children (and rightly so)."

The Frick Collection houses a magnificent collection of European paintings, sculptures, eighteenth century French furniture and an excellent collection of porcelain. Housed in the home of Henry Clay Frick on East 70th the setting enhances the collection enormously as you can get a rare glimpse of how these pieces were intended to be displayed and used - not in museums but in the homes of collectors as integral parts of their residences and lives. Recently the portico was enclosed to create the new portico gallery. I most highly recommend spending a day at the Frick Collection - it is illumining, educational and most rewarding."

We were going to the Frick not for the Art but for the building, just in awe that this was someone's house and we weren't disappointed. The art was pretty exciting also especially the room with the two Turners on opposite walls lighting up the room.Back to the view of Central Park, wow what a view Mr Frick had from his front rooms and we didn't even get to the second storey. The music room is a dream and showing a very informative video of the collection a good thing to do first.Handsets for each piece of art kept the kids amused as they entered random numbers and then tried to find the artwork from the description."

My Aunt & Uncle used to live 2 blocks away and took me there for the first time in 1978 when I was in 7th garde, and I have been enthralled with it ever since. Originally built as a private home, it was never used by the family. It is a very interessting story behind the Ruthless Industrial Magnet who was Mr.Frick.I suggest learning the history of the buildng before going. You don't need a full day there, but I would suggest 3-5 hours, depending on how much you like to study the artwork."

The Frick does not admit anyone under the age of 10 which is inconvenient for people traveling with kids, but a nice respite for those of us without.Admission is expensive. If you're a member of a museum check and see if they have a NARM reciprocal membership arrangement. We used that for free admission, although the volunteer staffing the desk seemed to have an issue with the fact that our membership cards had the NARM logo printed on them permanently rather than just having a little sticker stuck on.The included audio guide is excellent. Use it often as it adds context to entire rooms in the house in addition to the objects on display. While some of the paintings are merely pretty there are some masterpieces on display, including three Vermeers and two El Grecos and some Holbeins. A small exhibit on clocks is also fascinating.A lovely small museum."

The attendants were everywhere, I couldn't even sneak one in. The admission for adults is $18 and I would highly suggest taking the portable voice guide as it describes all the paintings which are number coordinated. Mr. Frick was definitely a baller. Titian? Van Dyck? Rembrandt? I was blown away by his collection and these masterpieces. Also beautiful were all the 16th century furniture pieces and overall d\u00e9cor. So European and fabulous.

It is across the street from Central Park and about 10 blocks south of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Frick is one of the great small art museums in America, with a quality collection of old master paintings and fine furniture housed in the former mansion of steel magnet Henry Clay Frick. Most of the collection was assembled by Mr. Frick before he died in 1919. The house is one of the few remaining Gilded Age mansions left on Fifth Avenue.Frick died in 1919 and in his will left the house and all of the furnishings and art to the public in a gallery (his old mansion) called The Frick Collection. In his will, his wife was allowed to live in the house the rest of her life. Following the death of his wife in 1931, the Frick Collection was opened to the public as a museum in 1935.I went to this museum on a Saturday afternoon in May with my wife and oldest daughter and really enjoyed it. Admission is generally $10 but on Sundays from 11 AM \u2013 1 PM you pay what you want. The museum was generally not very crowded. While the art is great I really enjoyed looking at the awesome gilded age mansion. I liked looking at Frick\u2019s mansion more than the priceless art. In addition, there was a great temporary Impressionist exhibit in the basement with works from Degas to Toulouse-Lautrec. I really liked Monet\u2019s Caricature of a Man with a Snuff Box. One of several caricatures he made to earn a living at the beginning of his career. I also liked the interesting clocks and watches on display.In summary, I really enjoyed the mansion and the Frick Collection and recommend it. My only complaint was that the security guards were a little over the top. They were very strict about checking your coat or wearing it (you could not carry it). At one point a guard came up to my daughter and told her she was too close to a painting and needed to back off (I think she was pointing to it and her finger was over some imaginary line)."

Henry Frick was not known for kindness, and the legacy lives on in the currently-hired staff of Art Nazis. For the 90 minutes it took me to go through, I heard patrons corrected/yelled at/what-have-you in a manner that was embarrassing and unprofessional on every level...including a young woman who merely wanted to sit down on the marble steps of the garden/fountain area and enjoy..nope..not allowed...move along, move along. Only one of the employees kindly welcomed the patrons to his area with a smile and gave directions cheerfully. The collection is impressive, but I'd rather spend another $5 and walk north to the Met, where you get the bang for the buck on every artistic and human. Once at the Frick was enough."

The house itself, artfully reconfigured as a museum while retaining fully the character of a home, is a huge part of the attraction.

The frick collection offers a unique museum experience, it's small enough to cover in one visit without feeling overwhelmed or dizzy from lack of sunlight but it also has a great variety of masterpieces, furniture, figurines and paintings from all time periods and many famous masters. While the works are not curated periodically its a great space to visit."

The Frick has it all: for voyeurs who want to see how one of New York's wealthiest patrons lived, you get to roam around the insanely beautiful (first floor) mansion of Henry Clay Frick himself. For art lovers - well, it doesn't get any better than this - everything from Vermeer and Rembrandt to Corot and Chardin....but the very very BEST of each, there's not a single dud in this collections. If it's quiet contemplation and respite you're after, the garden court is an oasis just steps off of 5th avenue. The Frick is another perfect gem of a museum (like the Tenement Museum in the Bowery or the nearby Neue Gallerie) that often gets jettisoned in favor of the \"big\" museums like the Met, MoMa, Whitney and Guggenheim....but don't miss this, it's one of the city's most special places, and lacking the crowds elsewhere..."

This is a wonderful collection of art in the most lovely setting. Every room is full of beautiful things, and all tastefully displayed with the rooms decorated with the particular paintings to be hung there in mind, which makes for a harmonious interior. There was an audio guide with information on almost every single painting which was very informative but still extremely accessible and friendly. So many beautiful things - and if you can manage to pass by the clock collection just as they are striking, that's a real treat. The courtyard garden is an oasis of peace just off 5th Avenue - if I lived or regularly visited New York I would definitely become a member just to have the privilege of dropping into this fabulous place as often as I could."

There are some very well known works of art here. A beautiful mansion on the inside, with an interior design that Includes an indoor courtyard and fountain area, a bit like the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C..

The collection of pieces is very accessible to normal folk like me and an education of sorts on how the artists did their work, why they did it and an insight into their methods.

One of the greatest attractions of Frick Museum is not just its rich collection of some magnificent paintings, sculptures and objets d'art but the mansion itself, the rare remaining vestige of the way the corporate robber barons used to live in the days past. The royal atrium, spacey halls, charming galleries and vestibules all add up to conjure up the images of the bygone days of the Gilded Age (of which, incidentally, Henry Clay Frick was arguably the worst, the most ruthless and cruelest representative).The collection itself features two amazing paintings by Hans Holbein, some interesting works by Francisco de Goya, terrific St-Jerome by El Greco, fantastic auto-portrait by Rembrandt, and enchanting The Bullfight by early \u00c9douard Manet, to name a few.Having said that, the entire collection does leave a hefty impression of a mismatch, for Mr. Frick (unlike Dr. Albert C.

The interior of this home is very impressive, as are the collections of art on display.

The portraits of Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell (advisors to King Henry VIII) facing each other across the fireplace are amazing. I liked it more than the Metropolitan Museum of Art."

My favourites were two iconic portraits by Hans Holbein of Thomas Moore and Thomas Cromwell.

Sundays are the best time to go (voluntary donations appreciated) otherwise it is $18 per person. Why go? The museum has one of the finest and most complete private collections of 18th century portrait paintings I have ever seen. What makes this rock is that the collection can be viewed in the original Frick home built in the 19th century which has always housed the collection. Very cool if you are a history buff like me! I have never seen as many Gainsborough portraits in one place in the Western Hemisphere. If you like art or history. Go !"

I rank it with the Wallace Collection in London and Nissim de Camondo's museum in Paris: small, exquisite, intimate and high quality content. I won't repeat others comments already here at TA but wholeheartedly endorse that it's a must see and proved to be the highlight of my recent visit to NYC, ostensibly to attend a performance at Birdland. I also visited MOMA which proved underwhelming but then I'm not a huge modernist. Their audio guides were less than helpful, offering little information. Not so at the Frick. The audio guides there (included in ticket price) were both insightful and interesting. Now to the bad. My husband and I had checked out of our hotel (this was a one night only trip) and had planned to visit the Frick en route to the airport for the return leg of our trip. We'd stayed only one night and both had rolling, smaller than regulation size, carry ons. Upon arrival, The Frick's Security refused to admit us saying they were unable to check our two bags. We were stunned. I've been to small museums across Europe and never encountered this. I've been to museums where security is so tight even a woman's handbag must be checked and left in lockers. Never anything like this. My husband gallantly offered to remain outside on the sunny steps with our bags, always happily entertained by his iPhone, while I entered the museum. He knew I'd been so looking forward to this visit. When I finished and joined him on the steps, apparently another couple arrived while I was gone who encountered the same problem with their carry ons only she put up a real battle and they were eventually allowed in. Okay, perhaps another case of the squeaky wheel gets oiled but a world class museum like the Frick, they must encounter this regularly if there were two instances within an hour of one another. Surely something could be done to address this? For this reason only, I dropped a star. Otherwise, if you're even the teensiest bit appreciative of Old World elegance, this is the place for you. A fairly recent addition to the collection of extraordinary clocks was utterly breathtaking and beautifully displayed. There's also a small but very good gift shop where there's lovely stationary, unusual luggage tags, and other small sundries.  Frick I love ya (and your charming docent just inside the front door) but please look into this!"

Even if you know nothing about art it is worth going just to see the house. It isn't too big but has some really amazing pieces (I loved the Turners on display) so if you are short on time I would go here over the met. Yes, the met has more but it is so big. Everyone told us you could spend a week at the met and I am used to all the museums in DC and wondered how big could this really be. I think you could spend a month at the met.

Regardless of one\u2019s knowledge of art and architectural history, The Frick Collection should not be missed on a visit to -- or when living in -- New York City. The extraordinary collection of important art, furniture and artistic objects are displayed in the massive home of Henry Clay Frick, one of America\u2019s great industrialists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The building is as interesting and exciting as its contents. Frick\u2019s knowledge and appreciation of great art and architecture, with the wealth to acquire them, is our good fortune, and The Frick Collection must be seen on a two or three hour visit to Mr. Frick\u2019s mind boggling mansion in New York City."

Tip: go early - we were there for opening time and the lack of visitors made walking the galleries a tranquil experience. At the centre is a peaceful patio with shrubs and froggie water spouts.

Some of the works were added by his daughter, who clearly shared his vision. The aesthetic is hard to sum up in a few words, but serene and exquisitely tasteful come to mind first. Not only are there many beautiful paintings and sculpture by well-known artists, but many of the furnishings and decorative elements were also chosen with the same vision in mind. The Rembrandts and Vermeers were especially exciting to see. The Oval Gallery, which houses life-size portraits by Whistler (the only American artist Frick allowed), was my personal favorite. And the spacious inner courtyard perfectly ties all the galleries together. This museum is what the Isabella Stuart Gardner Museum in Boston could be, if Gardner had not insisted nothing be changed after her death. The entire house can be seen and enjoyed within a few hours--a beautiful way to spend an afternoon or morning."

It is absolutely amazing that a collection this size (as compared to some huge museums) has such gems. It is our understanding that none of them are ever loaned out, so this is your only chance to see some absolutely stellar pieces. And it is much less crowded that the Met which can be overwhelming.

An amazing collection of mostly European masterpieces amassed by the industrial tycoon Henry Clay Frick on view in his mansion built in the early twentieth century on the upper East Side of NYC. Anyone would be astounded by this embarrassment of riches: Vermeer (three!!), Rembrandt (his self-portrait can hold you spellbound), van Dyck, Bellini, Turner, Gainsborough (check out Mall in Saint James's Park with the snippy women raising haughty eyebrows at who has just shown up for a stroll), Holbein (Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell staring each other down in the living room on either side of an El Greco), Titian, Fragonard, Boucher, Houdon and Verrocchio sculptures, Goya, Corot, a Stuart George Washington, and hundreds more. Along with furniture, carpets, bronzes, etc. that have their stories too. Special exhibits, as in both an Impressionist drawing exhibit and Piero della Francesca in America at present (May 2013).

Each room is thoughtfully laid out to enhance the art, with furniture and surroundings to complement, and give the visitor more of an experience, rather than just a viewing of a painting. The Fragonard room depicts a love story, for instance, and you can immerse yourself in that setting. My favourite was Renoir's \"Mother Strolling with her Children.\""

Frick amassed a fantastic collection of European and Asian art, that is utterly well displayed in a palatial frame. Among the jewels: St Jerome by El Greco, St. Francis in the Desert by Bellini, Thomas More by Holbein, The Polish Rider by Rembrandt, a room-full of Fragonards, two Vermeer...exquisite bronzes, porcelain, sculpture, rugs, furniture, and French boiserie complete the mise en scene.Be ready for long entrance lines, especially Sunday mornings."

The building and architecture are stunning and the collection is gorgeous. The art was selected by Henry Clay Frick himself, who enjoyed beauty and serenity. There is a large Rococo selection, in addition to works by Vermeer, Van Dyck, Renoir, Gainsborough, Rembrandt and many others. My favorites include \"Lady Hamilton as Nature\" by George Romney, \"Harmony in Pink and Gray: Lady Meux\" by James McNeill Whistler and the Fragonard and Boucher Rooms.

I am a native New Yorker and it always amazes me to think of what some of these buildings must have been like back in the day. It was astonishing to realize that this used to be someone's own private mansion residence on 5th Ave. The whole place is gorgeous and you will want to move in there yourself! It's right by Central Park so it makes a nice day to check this place out and then take a stroll in the park. Again, I am the kind of guy who gets tired after seeing 10 paintings but this was different because the art was spread out and not overwhelming while the actual house itself is so impressive that you didn't mind wandering through the details. Admission was a little pricey but hey, it's New York."

You walk from room to room and get to see the art up close.

A high light was to see juxtaposed the Holbein portraits of Sir Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell. One can spend a few hours (guided by a recorded hand piece) roaming and taking in these masters and not be totally overwhelmed as one often is in a larger museum or gallery where there is too much choice. The commentary is wonderful and the rooms/galleries and layout spacious and friendly. You can sit and take in the works of art. A beautiful elegant old building now holding a wonderful collection of master\u2019s works, well worth a visit.

Every time I go to NY I visit the Frick.I love art galleries but generally find the size, the number of paintings and the temptation to spend hours traipsing around always detracts from the experience in the end.The Frick is small and has some truly wonderful pieces of art in it. I always go to see the Bronzino of the young man in brilliant green and the two astonishing Holbeins. They are just my favourites and there is plenty more to see. They have added a new area with clocks and a few odds and ends this year which didn't particularly excite but I took two friends for the first time who really enjoyed the experience too.I love the story about Frick padding down the stairs in the middle of the night every now and again when he couldn't sleep and just sitting and gazing at one of his acquisitions. I think this appeals because rather than being a national collection collected and curated by professionals it was actually a loved collection collected by a man with lots of cash. It seems more personal somehow and seems to reflect a love of the art and objects.I would advise anyone who loves to pop in spend an hour looking at some beautiful art, some of it extremely familiar by very famous artists, to try the Frick. It's just a lovely little gallery in a Central park palazzo of the last century."

Always, the tone is muted as well-mannered viewers wandered the darkened halls, lined with treasures, and marveled - in many languages - at the richness of the collection.Although the gift shop offers quality cards, serious reading material & unusual souvenirs, nevertheless I always wish the Frick had a tea room, where visitors could prolong their retreat for a while longer with a cup of chamomile tea and a pastry."

The museum itself is still a treasure, both for the artwork as well as the house it's collected in. Even now, even with more people pressure, the little fountain in the middle is a calming place -- testimony to the foresight of Frick himself as well as the efforts of the museum management to preserve some of the old ambiance."

I visited the Frick Collection once 25 years ago and saw a decent Ingres exhibit. I went back to see the Piero della Francesca exhibit last week. I knew the exhibit would be small since most of Piero's works are located in Italy and cannot travel, but I didn't expect an exhibit that taught me less than a brief look the Wikipedia would. All right, one bad exhibit. So I toured the rest of the collection.Yes, the Frick does hold some great paintings (haphazardly collected by a Robber Baron with more money than taste), but the way they are displayed is terrible. The dark walls and carpets are worn and dirty and the lighting is circa the 1950s at best. The museum makes no effort to put the works in context--they are not even labeled or dated. The audio tour is a joke--grimy handheld gadgets that teach little. The \"free\" hourly movie basically talks about Frick, the capitalist--not the art.Another problem--no photos for its permanent collection. Are they kidding--I've been allowed to photograph most of the permanent collections in museums all over New York City, the USA, and Europe.The admission is expensive--$18 for adults. The Metropolitan Museum just up Fifth Avenue is $25 for the what I consider the best museum in the world. (By the way, the $25 is recommended, not required--you may pay less if you wish, but at $25 it is money well spent.) Skip the Frick and go directly to the Met, which is currently showing an Impressionist and Fashion exhibit that is fascinating--I didn't know more could be said about the Impressionist, but I can now do a whole new lecture on what I learned there last Sunday."

Whenever people go to NYC, I tell them to go to the Frick Museum; and of all the art museums in New York City, this is the only one I took my little girls to when we visited because I knew that if the paintings bored them, the Chinese vases and the furniture wouldn't. This is, as the Michelin Guide, once wrote, the \"pearl\" of New York City art museums, and I was delighted to share it with my partner on our visit to New York. Great Rembrandts, fabulous Vermeers, an exquisite Van Eyck, exemplary Van Dycks and Turners and...Bellini &...What a delight!"

Set in a beautiful old mansion on 5th ave, the Frick offers a relaxing environment to appreciate the Frick collect of paintings, bronzes, clocks and assorted items. Take a few minutes to sit in the central atrium around a water feature. Also a nice touch is they staggered the entry of visitors to keep the number of people reasonable inside and it worked. Also be advised coats and large bags/backpacks had to be checked (no charge though.) It helped keep things comfortable. Also they offer also at no charge a digital assistant for information on collection. A great relaxing few hours."

Among the amazing works of art you will see (the Thomas More...OMG) you will also have the opportunity to listen to how each room in the house was used. The house has just as much rich history of the works of art themselves.We spent about 2 hours at The Frick and would highly recommend it anybody looking to learn about the history of a NYC family who loved their art"

Everything from Impressionists to byzantine art is on display along with individual works by El Greco, Whistler and Rembrandt. As much as anything, however, it's interesting to reflect on the fact that one family actually lived in this place, thanks to the backbreaking work of coal miners in Pennsylvania. One disappointing aspect was that there was little biographical info on Frick himself, who had a fanous feud with his one-time boss and partner Andrew Carnegie, who lived just up the street."

Only the Mauritshuis in The Hague ranks with the Frick as a superb small museum in which you don't get overwhelmed by the size of the building or the wonderful collection. It would take far too long to list all of the Frick's treasures, but here are some works that I always revisit: Bellini's St. Francis, Thomas Cromwell and Thomas More, both by Holbein, the aged Rembrandt's self-portrait, the Vermeers (generally better than those in the Metropolitan Museum), the Bronzino, the Turners, Romney's Lady Hamilton, Goya's The Forge ... I could go on, but readers probably already know that this is a magnificent collection. And if you visit it before 1 p.m. on Sunday, you can pay what you want."

When Henry Frick moved to New York, he never mentioned to his architect that he was going to display much of his art in the home, most likely for fear that it would feel more like a museum than a home. What's amazing about the Frick collection is that the pieces are all of such high quality from Italian, Spanish and French artists, yet they are combined with equally great sculptures, furniture, rugs, silver and an amazing time collection mostly in the same manner as when Henry Frick lived there. Your experience is two-fold in that you can appreciate all these great artists, yet also experience how Mr. Frick lived in that era. Such a better way to experience the art than in a museum. There is a short (about 10-15 minutes) film on Mr. Frick and the collection that usually plays each day. I would highly recommend watching it (it's free) to give you an even better feel for the space. I would also recommend you check your coat upon entering (otherwise you have to wear it at all times) and pick up a audio set to hear about the most interesting pieces. Both are included in the price of admission."

But it is this cumilation of paintings that can easily blind you. From El Greco, Rembrandt, Impressionist, Titian to Gainsborough. I, for some reason, was so stunned by the latter artist, that had trouble tearing myself off from marvelling at those refined portrets.

If not, you will probably find this museum a bit under-stimulating. We had thought about taking a family trip here during Christmas week, and now I am glad we did not. My kids would have lost interest quickly, which would have dampened the whole experience for my wife and myself. The building housing the collection is, of course, beautiful, too. One small complaint: it would be nice if there were places to sit and relax in more of the rooms. On a rainy Saturday afternoon it was difficult to find a place to rest the bones after a long walk uptown. There is a fairly short, but interesting documentary movie about the Frick family and origin of the collection playing more or less continuously in one of the rooms. Lastly: $18 for admission to a fairly small museum is a bit pricey. But, hey, it's New York -- and you pay for quality here."

A young millionaire, coke manufacturer/ steel magnate/robber baron, Frick collected/amassed sculpture porcelains, rugs,silver, furniture, prints, paintings, etc. All are housed in Frick's 1913 mansion at 70th & 5th. Do not hesitate to pay a visit. It will take a few hours to appreciate this collection, a splendid exhibition of a gilded age family's extraordinary story, wealth and aesthetic. Take the audio tour of the museum.Then complete your immersion by reading 'Meet You In Hell' the story of the 'friendship' between Andrew Carnegie and Frick, by Les Standiford. A great wekend diversion."

It's not just that the paintings are excellent works of art in themselves. Just look at the condition of the individual artworks. \"St Francis in the Desert\", by Bellini, is five centuries old, but looks as if it were painted yesterday.I love the British aspects to this collection. On the one hand, Frick acquired the famous portraits of Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell by Hans Holbein (who wasn't Swiss, despite what the audio-guide tells you); then there is the dining-room, where all the pictures are by British artists, particularly two glorious full-length portraits by Gainsborough.Elsewhere, there are paintings by Frans Hals, Rembrandt, Turner, Constable, Veronese, Renoir, Goya, Guardi and Vermeer. I think that one of the Vermeers (I think they have three, altogether) is my favourite. There is some kind of conspiratorial theme. The gestures are perfect, with the mistress of the house facing away from the painter, while her maid is facing towards us. Did anyone portray the social hierarchy like that before Vermeer?"

Two Rembrandts, two Tizians, two Vermeers are perhaps worth a visit by themselves, but for me the main interest lied in seeing how the Frick family actually lived in this luxurious villa at the edge of Central Park, so in a way I found the Fragonard Room more convincing and immersive than the famed paintings. In many ways the Frick villa reminds me of the Isabella Stewart Gardner's \"house\" in Boston. On the other hand, way overpriced: for a $18 entrance fee, they could at least change the wall carpeting in the West Gallery which are scandalously dirty and worn out."

As I have said in other reviews, being a long-time resident of New York City, I love the smaller museums that are less famous and therefore less well-trod than the bigs like the Met. And the Frick is definitely in the top-5 if not the best of the smaller museums.Every piece in the collection is a gem, and the areas of specialty are just so interesting to me. For example, when my wife and I visited, we so enjoyed the many paintings of Thomas Gainsborough. His subject is often women of nobility, but there is a sensitivity to his way or portraying them. You can see the difference between a young woman who is still rather unsure of herself and the mature dutchess who looks out at us with attitude and just a touch of condescension. It is quite remarkable to see how the artist has captured his subjects so well.There is an exhibit of the Italian Renaissance painter Piero della Francesca at the Frick right now through mid-May, so we are certainly going to visit the Frick Collection again very soon!P.S. For people who like to hear concerts of classical music in a beautiful setting, the museum has a concert series - I haven't attended any concerts there yet, but am looking forward to doing that at some point."

I was 10 years old when I first visited and now I'm in my 60's. The museum building and its collection are first rate. No problem there. The problem (and this is recent) is the staff. My negative experience started at the coat check where the kids behind the counter were inattentive and seemed to dislike having their conversation interupted by someone checking a coat. So too, the Guards throughout were very unhelpful and rude. They engaged in small talk among themselves which did not enhance the visitor experience. One Guard (a man) was downright rude when I asked him a question (and I am assuming/concluding that answering visitors' questions is a part of his job). The Frick offers an introductory film in its Music Room. Outside the Music Room I asked this Guard: \"When does the film start?\". His curt response to me was \"Read the sign\". So, as directed, I looked for a sign and found it posted on the screen in the Music Room. The film is shown on a regular schedule. Could he not have told me the schedule rather than send me on a seach for a sign? Or if he felt I needed to see a sign, directed me to it in a polite manner? In short, the Frick needs to do some serious re-thinking about who it hires for its staff. Those I encountered reflect very poorly on this venerable institution."

He bought what he liked and bought them to look at them. A number were stealthily bought from the Soviets wen whey needed hard currency. The museum was once his residence and occupies the entire block on 5th Ave between E.70 and 71. Frick was said to often have trouble sleeping and would (could!) just get out of bed and spend a couple of hours looking at one of his amazing paintings--no need for a screen of any kind when the paintings on your walls were all things that you found thrilling."

I knew, and know, the Frick like the back of my hand. One lingers in the library, admiring the leather bound books, the woodwork, the light from the windows. The Impressionist Renoirs offer a calming sensation. Then one can revel at the Turners in the main gallery. Don't forget to include time for the short film about Frick and the other barons of the time. You will never be disappointed by a visit or a pilgrimage to the Frick."

Housed in a gorgeous home constructed by Henry Clay Frick in the early 1900's and the house alone is worth the price of admission.Audio guide is included in ticket price, a very nice touch.The collection is magnificent and amazing. Monet, Titian, and just about every classical artist you've ever heard of are included. Sculptures, bronzes, paintings, clocks, an assortment of gorgeous treasures.We enjoyed every moment of this visit, and suggest you need at least two to three hours to get a taste of what there is to see. Whether you are going to visit every gallery in New York, or you only have time for one, I urge you to make sure you visit Frick House and The Frick Collection. It is wonderful."

The Frick is chance to judge and reflect on the life and lifestyle of the owner while appreciating what money can buy. The Rembrandt self portrait alone is worth the price of admission."

As you walk through the music room to the library and then through the converted drawing room (the Fragonard room, redone to display large panels that Frick acquired from the Morgan collection) and into the serene dining room, you can imagine this collector thinking about what his next acquisition should be and it's ideal niche in this \"art gallery home\". The context makes this a personal and very engaging art display.Admission rates are very reasonable for this unique experience (NYU students and active duty military get free admission - what's not to love!). Children are not admitted. Special exhibits are located on the lower level and in the \"gallery\" area - Van Gogh's colorful \"portrait of a peasant\" was on display. The upper floors are not open to the public but there is an astoundingly opulent staircase and pipe organ that visitors can admire and imagine what it was like to live amid this collection."

Inside a most magnificent house/mansion is a truly breathtaking collection of art, perfectly hung inside this exquisite facility, which is never crowded. The works of art there are always something great, and you will never tire of being inside this facility. It is unlike any other museum you will ever go into, as it is small in it's actual sqaure footage, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in the depth and range of it's artistic works on display. I would say this is a MUST for anyone interested in art who visits NY and goes to see our museums."

The \"collection\", rather than a museum, lets one appreciate art in a unique way, by strolling through this lovely \"home\", you are transported to a different age and time...it is like observing an opera as it is being performed next to you rather than as part of an audience.Art galleries and museums attempt to create an atmosphere to frame the art of artists but they cannot achieve the effect the Frick collection can give to the displayed works.The atrium in the heart of the home welcomes you to a serene oasis in the middle of the city. The luxurious home allows you to feel at home, not as a guest but because you care for art, it seems to care that you are there and welcomes you as well....My sons and I thoroughly enjoyed the visit--we spent WAY too much time there, studying everything, enjoying the experience and atmosphere.

There was a show of drawings including Leonardo, Picaso, Monet, Matisse and many others which was also fascinating. Many of them are preparatory works and drawings for other paintings.

It is located in a genuine Fifth Avenue mansion built especially to house works of art. The permanent collection is breathtaking. This is not only about master paintings and Ming vases, the design of the rooms is a masterpiece in its own right. This museum is not for the faint of heart as there are not many places to sit down and take a break. You also have to borrow an audioguide if you want a description of the works as there are no panels, only small numbers allowing you to guide yourself through the works. The audioguide also provides a description of the design patterns of each room, which was probably my favourite part of the tour. The Fragonard room has got to be seen to be believed. The great thing about the Frick Collection is that you can forget about the audioguide if you want and just walk around all the rooms in 30 minutes. Or you can listen to it all and spend 5 hours, or anything in between (we actually visited The Cloisters in the same day and it didn't feel overwhelming). Not too crowded, not to pricey, just perfectly balanced!"

However, once the crowds disperse, the rooms are fairly empty and you can spend a while enjoying the works you prefer. I really like the way the collection was curated. Where most museums organize by style or era or location, the Frick is designed thematically and each room has a certain style. I liked that, because I tend towards certain types of art rather than necessarily work from Impressionists or work from the 1920s or Italian artists. I also really like that the sculptures were placed in the rooms on tables so the rooms felt \"lived in\" and not as much like an art museum."

The private collection includes some of the seminal works of art from just about every major European painter up until the early 20th century. The mansion itself is worth the price of admission and provides a lovely setting for the paintings. Henry Clay Frick seemed to have a special fondness for portraits and the collection includes several gems such as Hans Holbein's portrait of Sir Thomas Moore and Rembrant self portraits. I also like to size of the collection which can be easily enjoyed in an hour and a half. The Frick is a must see if you like fine paintings and you don't have to spend an entire day at a musuem.

We got there when it opened, and when we left there was a fairly long line to get in, so I'd recommend getting their early. It was a great way to spend an hour or so before heading into the City for the day. Would recommend seeing the video in the music hall, as it tells the great story of Mr. Frick and how the collection came to be."

Hard to categorize what their collections are categorized by but they have some of the best art around. The order of the galleries is more confusing than that of the Met which is far larger but it worked for me just to wander around and enjoy the art. Very nice personnel except for a nasty person at the admissions desk who should have taken a break instead of acting in a disgusting manner. But the supervisor was very kind and accommodating.

The guide gives you interesting tidbits about pieces and rooms in the house you would otherwise not know. (Unlike the Met, there are not a lot of informational displays throughout the house about the collection.) Not required (especially if you have limited time) but interesting also is the docent tour.

There was a very nice porcelain exhibition while we were there, and the drawing special exhibit was spectacular.You do need to know something about the art as the only information on the paintings or furniture are date/title and artist if known (latter not listed for much of furniture or porcelain)--there are no interpretive notes. We did not do the audio tour that is available (included in your admission price), which might have helped with those things. If you do that, you might have to spend a bit more time.I cannot emphasize enough that this is worth every penny you spend for admission. Of all the museums we have seen in New York, this is second only to the Met (and of a much more manageable scope and size). DO NOT MISS THIS!"

The conllection houses some of the most impressive artworks in the world and it's a bit like eating a whole box of belgian chocs in one go! It's quite alot to take in in asingle visit as there is simply so much to savour. However there is a wonderful pool and atrium area where you can take a quiet break if your palate needs to be refreshed between"

Of course, I understand some of these rules. Others were bananas. This drastically took away from the overall experience, and ultimately I don't remember much of the art. I've been to every art museum in New York, and this is the only place like that-- it was like that on every visit. I'm a quiet person, so it wasn't just my group. Very stiff.

Henry Frick had a purpose and focus to his collection - mostly women, all beautiful; the library and west wing contain some spectacular portraits. Most intriguing art gallery we've ever been too; well worth the 90 minutes.

There is a free audio tour included in the admission price which focuses on many of his prized collections and adds quite a bit of history as well. The collection is amazing \u2013 I am a huge fan of Titian whose art is rare to find and here were THREE in this collection, plus the Rembrandts! There is just so much to enjoy. Frick was not a big fan of American artists but the Whistler and Stuart art is outstanding. It was not overwhelming in size but definitely in quality. One cannot escape the fact that this was Frick\u2019s personal home (excuse me, mansion) and collection \u2013 the 2% that the majority of us have no clue how they live. At least they bequeathed these collections to the public but I am sure at a huge tax advantage. Definitely recommend to all and my non-art lover husband thoroughly enjoyed it. GO!

Henry Frick was an art connoisseur with exquisite taste and his collection of paintings and statuary is of remarkably high quality. The collection is housed in his grand but comfortable mansion on Fifth Avenue, and retains its intimate and domestic ambience. The garden courtyard is delightful place for a rest. My only regret is that the Frick does not have a cafe."

Having previously visited a gallery of modern art, we left feeling somewhat bewildered over what is deemed worthy of being called \"art\". What we found at The Frick was a jewel in the city; a lovely mansion and it's exquisite pieces were such a pleasure to view. To think that this was once a private home of a wealthy industrialist. I believe it was Mr. Frick; he would be so proud of his home today. There is a free day - just enquire."

There is an impressive conservatory room with a fountain but that is the only place you can really rest your weary legs.

I had not been to the Frick for a number of years, and returned there with friends last April.

Bernard Berenson found many of the Old Masters for Henry Clay Frick, builder of the house, and Bellini's \"St. Francis in Ecstasy\" is alone worth a visit, not to mention the El Grecos.

Very few people were at the Collection when we visited (Thursday morning) so it was possible to linger and enjoy the pieces without the crowds. A nice alternative to the masses at the Met.

The Frick is a small museum compared with the others in New York, but this makes the relics easier to see in detail without the crowds and endless galleries to wander through. Being the private collection of a wealthy man, in his own home, makes this museum very personal. Well worth a visit."

Over the top in turn of the century dollars, the works amassed by this entrepreneur and Carnegie cohort speak to Frick's ( I like what I like..and only two American artista made the grade) are truly unique in their individual and collective stories. even though some audio tours can be a bother, this one is not to be missed for its background stories...the mistress/wife witth the wandering eye, Frick's fascination with portraits of women ( an entire gallery room-full), his delight in purchasing companion pieces and reuniting sets) and nary a mention of his wife ( It's all about him. fascinating) But he did \"allow\" his wife to live on in the home for over a decade after his death, thanks hon. all the while preparing this home to live on as a museum.. With many $$$ left to accomplish just that) The setting is impeccible and lovely, and wished we could have spent more time. couple of tips: Room monitors are certainly \" masters of their domain\" and actually made me a bit nervous every time I leaned in to take a closer look. there are no barriers, and per the museum this is meant to make for a relaxed atmosphere, but there are definitely invisible borders that each rotating personnel in the room apparently decide. might be better just to have a rail to make the lines definite. Have been in other museums , i.e. the Getty, and they are much less jumpy there. also make note that the gift shop closes about 20 minutes before the museum closes ( and nary a announcement or posting re this fact as you enter) When I missed out on the opportunity to spend my money, and inquired about the closure, was told that the posting is INSIDE the gift shop."

Small but imposing, the building contains works by Titian, Tintoretto, Bellini, Renoir, Degas and many more, all carefully chosen by Mr. Frick himself. Downstairs there is always a wonderful changing special exhibition. This is one of the special spaces in Manhattan and a must-see for anyone interested in art."

Well, all collections are - of course - but this was the gift of one man: William Clay FRICK (1849-1919) - immensely wealthy from coking coal out of Pittsburgh/a sometime partner of Andrew CARNEGIE - and a collector of art - furniture - porcelain - statuary - almost exclusively from Europe and from Far East Asia. It is reasonably priced ($18) for adults (no child under 10 permitted - because it is arranged without barriers - as it was when FRICK lived here) - but for those for whom that sum is too much there is an out! Those who enter between 11.00 am and 1.00 pm on Sundays may pay what they wish - I guess some pay only a dollar. My wife and I are doing our best to see as much of this great city as we can - we have some indulgences - but otherwise a strict budget - and so we took advantage of this consideration to proffer a mere $5 each to-day. So thank-you Mr FRICK - for your aesthetic sensibilities and for understanding that though we may not all have the wherewithal it does not preclude our own desire to see and appreciate the beautiful objets d'art which you gathered together. And thank you, too, to the foundation which manages your gift! By the way - though the line waiting from before 11.00 am may seem lengthy - it moves swiftly - 20 or so entering at time - depositing bulky backpacks - and paying - and picking up complimentary audio-phones - without a continual press of crowds from behind. Considerate. And the lines move quickly - you will find."

The Frick Collection is a private house and is the former home of Henry Clay Frick, it was was designed by Thomas Hastings and constructed in 1913-1914. It is located at 1 East 70th Street, and what a home it is. It's a treasure trove of art and antique furniture, there are Whistler paintings and special exhibits that occur all the time. It's a bit of a walk from the Metropolitan Museum of Art but if your adventurous and don't mind a bit of a walk pay a visit, you will not be disappointed."

We visited during the \"pay as you wish\" hours on a Sunday, they lady at the desk was not very discreet and was suggesting to people who didn't want to pay full price to pay at least dollar for admission and we could hear this clearly further down the queue. We did pay what we wished and set off to tour the collection. Next came the \"free\"audio guide which I nearly missed as the man was announcing something you paid for at that desk. So we set off with our audio guide, after the first room we were behind an old lady that put her hand on a piece of marble furniture in a hallway as she walked by, a member of staff spoke to her in a rude fashion about this. In the next room a teenager was texting, again another staff member was rude to them about it. I can understand why they felt they had to address these things, but there are ways of doing this kindly. All these staff episodes tainted our visit to view the collection. The staff overall seemed uptight, it must be how they are expected to work.Glad I had not payed the full admission price for this."

The collection is filled with masterworks of Europe with a modest number of Impressionist works collected toward the end of Mr Frick's life. In particular, the Vemeers are stunning and the Whistlers allowed us to appreciate his work more fully. While the infamous robber baron Henry Clay Frick did not have many admirable qualities by our 21st century sensibilities, we all benefit that he bequeathed this amazing house and the collection for the public benefit. We plan to return on a future trip and recommend it to those who have only limited time to devote to art."

Just a short walk south of the Met on the other side of 5th you'll find a mansion built by a 'robber baron' in the early 1900's. In that mansion he and his descendants and trustees have amassed the most magnificent private collection of art that I've seen. Give yourself at least 2 hours to wander through this magnificent house and see all the masterpieces. There are works by Bellini, Tiepolo, Rembrandt, Whistler, Turner, Constable, Gainsborough, Lippi, Titian, Veronese, Holbein, Vermeer, El Greco, Manet, Renoir, Degas, etc. The admission fee is reasonable with a student rate available. Included in the fee is a handy and easy to use audio guide. This is truly a spectacular collection. Only downside - no photos."

But that's before they set foot in the first room of this 5th Avenue mansion which houses the personal art collection of the Gilded Age, Robber Baron, Henry Clay Frick. Then they thank me...profusely! Imagine the works of Fragonard, Rembrandt, El Greco and the most famous artists in the world displayed with exquisite taste over a mantle piece in a room designed to make the visitor feel the artists message and admire other objects from the same period. Check out the website, use the free audio guide, and appreciate the exquisite taste of this ruthless steel magnate and assistant of Andrew Carnegie who lowered worker's salaries when profits dropped and called in the Pinkerton guards to break up strikes. He gained the sympathy of the public when he was shot by an anarchist who had nothing to do with the strikes. Fortunately the mansion where he lived and his decision to leave his art collection to the public reveals a different side of his character. Not to be missed. Can only be compared to the collections of Gardner and Barnes."

The cool thing about the Frick is that it is a 5th Ave mansion formally owned by a steel baron so it is laid out like an opulent home of the period with the art displayed much like it would have been back in the day. Its a very cool experience to wander around the home and see how the pieces tie together with the furniture and other decorations. It makes for quite an impression. They also have an excellent policy on children, children under the age of 10 are forbidden and children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult. This means you can enjoy the collection and the experience to full effect without screaming brats running everywhere, a huge bonus for me."

Frick, every room was amazing and please do take the handheld acoustical tour devices that is included in your fee of the museum,I saw many people not taking the device, perhaps people thought that there was fee for it...but there is none..check their website... is a wealth of information and you can go at your own pace as you walk around and look at each painting by and the full collection, it was the most helpful to press the number on the device accordingly to each each painting...At the moment the exhibition of Johann Christian Neuber every detail of the exhibit was unbelievable, the details of each box so beautiful, take your time and look at them carefully, the table with all the gem stones is so beautiful to just admire!! Do visit the museum, highly recommended and not to not miss here in NYC...even if you live here is a must go to see, being that is history that surround us that we miss by just walking by on the street and not knowing the history that holds inside of this exceptional man Frick and his passion..."

The Fricks knew art and demonstrated excellent taste in their choice of purchase.2. The museum is relatively small, and allows the visitor a serene tour of its exhibits, without the rush required in big museums, without the feeling of being lost in the infinity of subjects and with no feeling of getting out of it energy-drained..3. The atmosphere is pleasant.4. One of the jewels of this museum is the building housing the collection. One word - beautiful!to sum it up - this is the place in NYC where one can enjoy most art in least time.Chaim Kropach"

The Frick collection is a farily small museum that does not even try to be an encyclopedic collection like the Met or the Lourve, but what it has is one collector's view of the best of western painting. Nearly every picture is a masterpiece, and the private home setting seems much more natural a place to view art that most museums can manage. As I said, nearly every piece is very good, but for me the Bellini and the three Vermeers were enough reward to plan a trip. Definitely go - and leave enough time to linger with these exquisite masterpieces."

No Museum or Gallery I have visited offers more great art per square inch or a more comprehensive view of world art ( allowing for the modest size of the collection) than this gorgeous palace built from the embers of Henry Clay Frick\u2019s coke-production enterprise. Vermeer, Hals, Rembrandt, Titian, Holbein, Constable, Gainsborough --- to name only some of the principle contributors ---- are represented by several works apiece, all of the highest quality. Fine examples of the Siena school make up one of the rooms, and ravishing examples of French impressionist masterpieces liberally adorn the walls. Matching the stellar craftsmanship of the paintings are sculptures ( Gianbologna, Cellini, Houdon and Rodin), ceramics ( Meissen, Sevres, Limoges and other European schools as well as great works from the Orient), furniture, clocks, mirrors ---- all of which give a serene yet homely luxury to this magnificent once-domesticated home. Spectacular in effect and daring in execution are the two reconstructed rooms whose walls are made up of frescoes by Fragonard and Boucher. However for me, on my 4th visit, most memorable of all was a special exhibition of miniature caskets created by a German artist entirely unknown to me ---- Johann Christian Neuber. The exquisite skill with which he deploys woods, jewels and precious metals outclasses that of the great Faberge and is infinitely more varied. This treasure trove stands as a testament of how enormous wealth, when combined with generosity, can enrich the lives of lesser mortals."

It combines an interesting history and a great piece of New York architecture with one of the great private art collections. It is also located not far from the Metropolitan Museum in Manhattan. This museum is remarkable for two Vermeers (only 34 in existence), two fantanstic Gainsboroughs, an imortant Holbein, Van Dykes, Rembrants, and many other important European masterpieces in the house that Frick built to house his collection. Paintings are throughout the house and in a special gallery at the back. The house and collection do have a certain cold monumentalism and are designed to impress. The Andre-Jacquemart House (Baron Haussman Road) in Paris provides a similar kind of house museum but is more beautiful and personal. It is designed to be impressive as well, but is warmer and more personal and more elegant, and conveys the owners love of art."

Frick was a collector of art work and eventually wanted his home to be a museum. He lived there only 5 years when he died. After his wife died in the early 1930s the house was converted into a museum and over the years it has doubled in size, but is still a relatively small, easy to visit place.There is a 10 film about Frick and the house and museum which should be seen first. There are paintings, furniture and decorative art work in various rooms, some look like they did in the early part of the 20th century. There are quite a few paintings by certain well known artists--Whistler, Goya, Hals, Vermeer (3 paintings), El Greco, Rembrandt, etc. Make sure to visit the lovely enclosed garden to relax and enjoy.The museum is a member of the National American Reciprocal Museums (NARM) and membership in those museums allows for free admission. There is an audio tour of the art work which is an additonal cost, as well as a booklet, also an additional cost.This is a great location on Fifth Ave. and 70th Street right across from Central Park and is easily reached by bus.or subway."

The Frick Collection has been getting steadily more popular for both New Yorkers and visitors, and one can see why. I wouldn't exactly call it an intimate space as Mr Frick's home is more like a mansion with some large additions built after his death. But if you don't visit on weekends - then you may be lucky to avoid huge crowds. The collection is fairly conservative but of brilliant quality. Almost entirely European (there are a few Whistlers, though) with a good bunch of British artists, the paintings are on display in mostly small galleries. A free audio guide is included in the admission and the commentaries are excellent. Be warned, though: if you listen to all the commentaries the tour of the Frick can easily take 4 to 5 hours. On Sundays- between 11.00 and 1.00 am you can pay what you can afford; $5-10 per person was what I saw most people paying. At other times entry costs $17 ($15 for senior citizens)."

But the Frick Collection, in its setting and graceful authenticity, allows one to easily imagine being a private guest in this great house. On the first floor of the opulent private home of early twentieth century industrialist, Henry Clay Frick, visitors are able to intimately enjoy his extraordinary and unbelievably well-maintained art collection as he would have intended. My favorite thing about the museum is its small scale that does not overwhelm. When I visit I feel more rested and restored rather than exhausted. Though one can see the entire collection in an hour or so, plan more time and let your imagination wander. Bring a copy of \"Time and Again\" to read on a bench in the serene conservatory."

Frick was a ruthless businessman who treated his workers badly, but that's water under the bridge, alas. Now he's remembered for assembling this magnificent collection. This is a small, comfortably dowdy museum. Unlike the Met, MOMA or the Morgan, it's had no big renovations and that's part of its charm. It's refreshingly old-fashioned inside. It's the way all museums used to be before they started trying to attract mega-crowds with blockbuster shows. There's no cafe and only a tiny bookstore. The collection is just the right size, not too small and not so large that its exhausting. It's pay what you wish on Sunday mornings until noon."

Certainly the Met is awe-inspiring because of its sheer size but it can also be overwhelming. (Don't get me wrong, I also loved the Met!) At the Fricke Collection you can truly appreciate the individual masterpieces as well as the entire collection because the scale is more approachable. I also loved seeing the artwork in a more \"residential\" setting and I'm so glad we took the time to visit this collection. (For the casual visitor, you can experience the Fricke in 2-3 hours.)"

For those who enjoy art but who feel overwhelmed by taking in a large museum, this is the perfect museum to visit. Art from all decades---Medieval, Renaissance, 18th Century French and Spanish, to late 19th Century French and American art tastefully decorates this beautiful mansion. Visitors may stroll through this beautiful home and view the historic works of art that grace the walls and hallways of this former home. The collection is not overly large, so it's quite easy to take it all in without feeling overwhelmed. The museum also offers an audio guide for a small fee, so visitors who are interested in learning the specifics of each painting and artist may do so. The Museum is located on 5th Avenue, across from Central Park, on Museum Mile, so it's within easy walking distance of the Park and Midtown Manhattan. The Frick not only gives visitors a glimpse of beautiful art, it also allows visitors to glimpse the lifestyle of one of America's foremost industrialists and art collectors."

You will see how the rooms were arranged a hundred years ago and feel the life of this family. If you want to save some money, go there on Sundays during lunch time which is pay as you wish.

The house itself is a work of art and then the very personal and eclectic collection of painting, sculpture and more is a treat for the eyes. The brief film provides a good foundation for appreciating the Frick Collection. Take a few minutes to watch it."

The feeling is more intimate than New York's major art museums (the Met, MOMA) as it once was Mr. Frick's home. His acquisitions were world-class. How many museums own a Vermeer? The setting is serene, with a fountain at the core of the building. It has an excellent gift shop, and the staff are welcoming. It has an excellent resource library for scholars and surrounding grounds (modest in size but perfect for the setting). I cannot find fault with the place and I often include it as a short walk (12 blocks) south of the Met. After the grandeur of the Met's collection and setting, the Frick is an antidote of serenity. Definitely worth a trip."

This is not a gallery but a mansion where a single visionary man bought and then hung great European masterpieces where he wanted to live with them. Here you can imagine sitting in a chair to contemplate a Turner or Vermeer, or dining surrounded by great portraits, just as hundreds of others did when it was private - and wasn't that what these pictures were painted for, for private enjoyment in houses?It was a wondrous shock to turn into a small ante room and to find an El Greco. It alone must be worth enough to buy a house for everyone else who was in the Frick that morning. I could imagine the smile of pleasure it gave Mr Frick when he walked past it. A formal gallery can't ever do that.So, if your taste for art galleries is minor, make this a major stopping point. As well as enjoying the amazing pictures it's worth taking time to sit, perhaps in the central water garden and imagine living with such privileged grandeur. I didn't use the audio guide as I wanted to pretend I was an invited guest (easy to do) but I could see great wonder and awe on the faces of many who did.The Metropolitan, the Guggenheim and the Neue Gallerie (an ex-Rockfeller Mansion that serves spectacular pastries and cakes with its turn of the century Austrian art, including a Klimt) are all on Fifth Avenue too. But whether you have a day or a week, even if just a single hour, the Frick will give you an astonishing insight into the life of rich New York and sate you with wondrous images that will never leave you. It's a privilege without comparison that I know."

If you get overwhelmed with gigantic museums with more art then you will ever have time to see, then you'll love the Frick (I said something similar in my review on the MoMA, but this is even more true here). One of the nice things about the Frick is that you also get to enjoy walking through the actual mansion and learning a bit about the history of the collection. Whenever I visit the Frick, I always think of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. I guess it's that private collection/mansion feel. Both are very comfortable places to walk around and enjoy art -- not arranged historically or by artist, but completely aesthetically. Art is placed in spots and next to other pieces of art because they look beautiful there, and not for any other reason. I like that. :)"

The building, both the inside and outside, are beautiful in their own right and in a lovely location. The artwork is a thoughtful and impressive collection that will delight art enthusiasts and art newbies. It's really amazing all of the pieces that are in this relatively small museum (at least compared to the National Gallery, Louvre, etc.). There's something for everyone to appreciate here."

If you are in NYC and you really love art, the Frick is an essential stop.Henry Clay Frick was the quintessential \"Coal Baron.\" Fabulously wealthy, he built a magnificent private mansion on Fifth Ave. and filled it with a superb collection of European paintings, decorative items and furniture. Mr. Frick left his home and collection as a gift to the public.  Visiting the museum is like touring the private home of a late 19th early 20th century \"Robber Baron\" who was posessed of the highest possible taste.  Mr. Frick's collection is displayed as though he were to walk through the door with Mr. Morgan and Mr. Gould to have a chat and a coffee under the Holbein, Rembrandt or Corot.  A major advantage of this museum is that children are neither seen nor heard, and, in general, the patrons are actually looking at the paintings and not checking off boxes on a \"must see\" list. The Frick has revolving shows, right now there are some exceptional Italian bronzes, but the collection and the setting are the real draw. When you get exhausted by the Met and its crowds, walk ten blocks south and visit the refreshing oasis of civility at the Frick."

I'm not sure what is more amazing -- that this was someone's personal residence, the superior quality of the collection, or that a place like this still exists today much as it did at the turn of the century. It truly is a museum like no other. Forget ropes, barriers, organization, and the formality of a traditional museum. This was Frick's residence and as such the artwork is displayed much as regular person would. No guides, no formal traffic pattern. If anything, this lack of formality is the magic of this collection and home. It's quite soothing. Rooms are still set up much as their original functions, such as the study and the dining room. By all means, pick up an audio guide. You're missing a lot of background information about how the collection and house were put together that enhances the experience. Also, do try typing in random #s into the audio guide similar to the #s you see posted. In doing so, you'll hit information about exhibits which aren't currently on display but are still quite fascinating. A few notes: To maintain the ambiance, attendance is limited and queues can be long at the beginning and ending of temporary exhibits. Even at peak times, the queue does move reasonably fast and the experience is worth the wait. Photography is NOT allowed under any circumstances (which is a shame, but I understand their reasoning)."

All are displayed in their original setting in a Fifth Avenue mansion at East 70th Street. The interior of the mansion boasts an indoor courtyard where one can sit on a bench and enjoy the peace of a quiet garden surrounding a pool."

I have many favorite spots to visit but over the years, the most tranquil and culturally powerful place I have ever visited is the Frick Collection. In the lower 70's on the East Side it is situated right across from Central Park. It has an old museum look to it, with an incredible Victorian Mansion entrance and the best selected works of many of the world's greatest artists. Henry Clay Frick, the indistrialist and philanthropist collected many of the most incredible paintings his world had to offer. Constable, Vermeer, El Greco, Van Gogh and Velazquez are displayed to name just a few. The presentation and the flowing rooms allow an individual plenty of time and space to study the works in detail. The neighborhood that surrounds the museum is chic and inspiring, setting the scene for what one sees inside. It is economical and you are under no time constraints should you wish to linger at a painting! Don't miss this New York Treasure!!!"

It's small enough to be manageable in a few hours, but every single piece is of high quality and beautiful. Mr. Frick's guide for collecting was that it had to make him feel good, and you can see that in the art. An extra treat is seeing the mansion Frick built.

Set in Frick's baronial mansion, one get's a sense of the Old New York of Henry James and Edith Wharton, and the indoor conservatory is restful. There are interesting small rotating exhibits, and no annoying commercial enterprises (just a small museum shop). A must-see for any art lover."

It is not too far away from the Met, so I was able to easily walk to the Frick after an earlier visit to the Met.Henry Clay Frick was an astonishingly wealthy guy who bought up a city block for his house and art collection. It was very interesting to walk through his mansion and see the various pieces of artwork that he collected. He must have been one very interesting guy. For me the highlight of the trip was a special Renior exhibit that was on display during my visit. One large salon of the mansion was dedicated entirely to Renior paintings that had been brought together from a wide variety of museums. So not only were the pieces excellent, having them all in one place at one time was extraordinary.Regrettably no photos were permitted anywhere in the Frick. Very enjoyable and very interesting. However I would scale back my high marks for the Frick if the Renior exhibit had not be there. Still worth a visit however. A real glimpse back in time to the early part of the 20th Century."

An exquisite collection of the world's finest artists housed in impeccably elegant surroundings and minus the hordes of museum mile. There are finer works and in greater numbers elsewhere but the unity of this collection is unsurpassed. Bellini's St Francis, Holbein's Thomas More and Rembrandt's Polish Rider are the popular pieces but there are also works by Cimabue, El Greco, Goya, Hals, David and Ingres. My own favourites are a group of Turner's harbour views and a clutch of subdued Dutch landscapes which lose little in comparison with the Constables situated nearby. The sculpture collection is similarly tasteful; look out for the small Michelangelo casually placed on a viewing table amongst other works and minus the ubiquitous fanfare. In fact, when you appreciate the collection in its entirety even the preponderance of Boucher and Fragonard seems a forgivable lapse."

Because it is a much smaller collection than the vast assemblages of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and MOMA, it is comfortably viewed in a few hours, in a setting of domestic scale and ambience.Works include icons from the early Middle Ages,small bronzes, porcelains, ceramics and works by European masters and the Impressionists.

I was surprised to find that you are given a free hand held talking guide, and each exhibit is numbered to correspond with the commentary, so you can view the artefacts (some sculptures and fine porcelein as well as paintings) in any order. The whole atmosphere is one of peace and tranquility. A superb little collection and well worth a visit."

After visiting the larger museums in NYC it was so pleasant to go to The Frick and be taken back in time to a period of elegance and learning. The art collection is superb and wide ranging. From wonderful bronzes to seaside paintings by artists that I was not familiar with I was enthralled. Do not miss the three Vermeers that are there--very rare to have three paintings by Vermeer in a private collection. This collection is truly a gift to NYC. Admission is free on Sunday from 11-1. We tried to pay and the sweet girl charged us a \"student\" rate even though my husband and I were in NYC celebrating my 56th birthday."

Beautiful Renaissance and Impressionist paintings, furniture, sculpture and furnishings. It is not nearly as overwhelming as the larger museums, and can be taken in entirely in less than two hours. Even if the museum were empty of all the artworks, it would still be worth the visit for the beauty of the mansion itself. Would probably be No. 1 or 2 on the second tier of museums to visit in New York."

If you've got a spare few hours and enjoy visiting museums and galleries, you should certainly check out the Frick Collection at the edge of Central Park.It's a beautiful house and it's lovely to see the art collection in situ amongst the furniture and stylings of the family who lived there....this makes it a bit different to just walking round an art gallery. I was amazed by some of the art that's there that I recognised as well. Frick amassed quite an impressive collection of a range of very beautiful pieces!I think it's good value. You get quite an all-round experience of the pieces of art themselves, the architecture and design of the house and the story of Henry Frick and his vision. You get a free audio guide which you would pay a extra for in most places. They did seem quite strict on enforcing the rules but why not... it's probably why it's been maintained so well!! It didn't take me long to get around - maybe a couple of hours at a very leisurely pace. It's quite nice to go somewhere a bit smaller and more manageable if, like me, you are also visiting the vastness of some of the other enormous museums and galleries in NY."

I get a headache at the MET, it is really overwhelming, I can take it for a couple of hours tops. This feels like a visit to someone's home. The mansion itself is very beautiful, amazing that it is in the heart of such a busy city. Note that kids under 10 are not admitted. Great place to start your day and go for a walk and lunch in the park."

It was great being able to see the house as part of a private tour. After, we retrieved free audioguides and spent more time visiting each piece of the collection. There is also a brief film about the collection that's worthwhile seeing. We had a great time and enjoyed the collection very much. They are very strict about backpacks, packages, coats, etc. I think they are 100% correct to be so strict. Many valuable pieces of Sevres porcelain are out on display- not behind glass or inside cases. So, it would be very easy for something to get bumped or broken. It was so nice being able to see these items out on display like they were meant to be instead of behind glass or inside a case."

Long line for tickets but it moved quickly (dont forget to use your uni ID if you have one!) Free audio tour on handheld devices provides interesting information that doesnt drag on. Differents forms of art (paintings, sculptures, furniture, etc) in different styles Italian Renaissance, French Impressionism, Baroque and so much more) many from famous artists that anyone would know. My advice to you would be to have Sunday brunch at st. ambroeus, head to Frick Collection for several hours (get in on the Sunday sketch action) and afterwards spend some time (window) shopping on Madison or strolling by the park."

This gilded age mansion built by Henry Clay Frick, a 19th century industrialist, was designed to house Frick's magnificent art collection. It's hard to pick a favourite among a Rembrandt self-portrait, Van Dyke's portraits of Margareta and Frans Snyder, Bellini's St. Francis of Assisi. The list is endless and demonstrates Frick's determination to own the best. NOTE THAT CHILDREN UNDER 10 ARE NOT PERMITTED as the art work is not roped off and priceless works of art can be easily damaged.The mansion itself is a work of art. This is how the 1% lived in the pre-war era. A docent-led tour is well worth it. This museum is one of my favourites."

The Frick mansion, as so many others, has been opened to the public and filled with priceless treasures. Here you can enjoy, in a home-like setting (albeit a splendid one) the works of the old masters, fine furniture, clocks, oriental carpets, textiles, porcelains and guilded mirrors. This is an atmosphere of slow savoring rather than frenzied viewing thus children don't do particularly well in this rarified ambience but adults find the space soothing. So if you like such artists as Bellini, Corot, Gainsborough, El Greco, Boucher and Whistler among others, spend some time in the thrall of the Frick."

            "review": "Some of the World's Greatest Art in a Mansion Setting. You have seen some of the greatest art in the world from the Frick, but probably didn't even realize it.The Frick is housed in the mansion of essentially a steel baron from the turn of the last century. He used his vast wealth to build both the beautiful mansion and, far more importantly, acquire phenomenal artwork that formed the core of this museum after his death.This is not a large museum, as the art is in what were the dining room, living room, etc. of the house, but what there is is magnificent, and something for all tastes. There are the Holbein portraits of Sir Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell displayed across from each other. Both are great in their own right, but the contrast is amazing. Even if your knowledge of that era is based on \"the Tudors,\" you will awed at the characters displayed in these works.The other works include certainly one of the best Rembrandt self-portraits, and iconic paintings (you will recognize many of them) by El Greco, Renoir, Vermeer, Turner, and many others. There is also a great deal of sculpture and other decorative arts.There are times (such as Sunday morning) when you can get in at less than full rate, but it can get crowded.Grab one of the audio guides (they're free) when you come in. You simply punch in the number of whatever painting interests you and it will tell you 2-3 minutes about it. We found the descriptions to be very helpful and not laden with art appreciation jargon.Note that they don't allow children under 10 (I think part of it is the small statuary that is everywhere), but, frankly, young children probably wouldn't enjoy the Frick anyway. Young teens and older, however, should be fine.You can see the highlights of this museum in one to two hours. What distinguishes it from other attractions is that while it has many fewer pieces than other museums, what it has is all among the very best."

I found a Dutch landscape painting by an artist named Hobemma that fascinated me and the Vermeers were stunning. It was a little pricey at $18 per entry, but well worth the visit. Each visitor was given a small pre-recorded tour to listen to; you accessed appropriate information based upon identifying number tags that were at the side of most paintings. It was so helpful, and if you didn't want to hear about any particular piece you just didn't enter its number. Sweet! There were a few rooms to be able to sit down when you got tired from standing. Those were especially nice for older patrons. Allin all, I would defintely visit there again."

I sat down at the Garden Court at about 3:15p and was asked to leave because they were closing that portion for a special event. Then I noticed that the video wasn't available either. Come on! I paid the full price of $18 for 7 paintings and 45 min?? That's not cool so I asked the admissions lady if I could have a pass to come back another time. She was lovely and saw my point and turned to ask an older woman Isabel if she could. Haughtily Isabel commanded, \"there are no paintings to see in the Garden Court and the video is on You Tube!\" WOW!!! How unkind, un-accomodating! One thing is for sure....that is the LAST time I will pay $18 for admission.

We chose to visit the Frick during our weekend in NYC over the Metropolitan Museum not only because of its more manageable size, but because the Frick currently has a special exhibit called Renoir, Impressionism and Full Length Paintings. On Sunday the Frick offers a couple of hours (11am-1pm) where they allow people to pay what they wish for admission, so there was already a line when we arrived a few minutes before 11 am, but it moved fairly quickly once the museum opened. We took advantage of the free audio guide which was very helpful, but be aware that not every item is described in the audio guide. We really enjoyed the lovely and impressive variety of art, sculpture and beautiful furnishings. Each room is exquisite, and you can tell Frick selected pieces that were \"easy to live with\" rather than being provocative. He was also known for reuniting the works of artists which had been separated and there are several examples of this in the collection. After perusing the permanent portion of the collection, we sat a while in the courtyard in the center of the gallery to rest our feet a bit, and then waited our turn to enter the room where the Renoirs are on display. Though there aren\u2019t a large number of works in the Renoir exhibit, they\u2019re quite beautiful--well worth seeing before the exhibit ends on May 13, 2012. We also took a few minutes to sit through the short film of Henry Frick\u2019s life and how he acquired his collection, which was very interesting. Even the gift shop was worth a brief stop. I was able to pick up very affordable souvenirs: bookmarks ($3) with images of the full length Renoirs. The museum doesn't admit small children, and they require that large bags and coats be checked to minimize risk of damage to the furnishings and art. Though the museum is small, I would recommend allowing at least 2 hours to take everything in. I felt it was well worth the $18 admission."

The Frick Collection had a much-touted Renoir exhibit that we visited, but were disappointed by the paucity of the work--only nine paintings! This is hardly an \"exhibit\" and certainly didn't justify the entrance fee ($18.00 for adults) that many people paid, basically to see just that exhibit. (True the fee entitles you to see other Frick holdings, but most visitors would not find many of them particularly noteworthy.) A visitor would have expected the Frick to flesh out the Renoir exhibit with some more Renoir works...or at least some more displays about Renoir's life and career."

The Frick Collection is housed in a beautiful Guilded Age mansion built as a home by Mr. Frick, but with the expressed intent it serve as a showcase for his extensive art collection after his death. And so it has.The mansion is located along NYC's famous \"museum mile\" and backs directly onto Central Park. It is reminiscent of the Phillips (DC) and the Gardner (Boston); many small galleries, lavish settings, and a feeling that it is pretty much \"doable\" in one wonderful afternoon. And, the fees are a bit more reasonable than some of the larger NYC museums.Frick's main collection interests were portraits (especially of beautiful women!) and landscapes. The works span about the 17th - early 20th centuries. The collections have been added to since Frick's death, but with a careful eye to maintaining the sensibility of the original.Along with the original collection, changing exhibitons are shown. We saw a fabulous Renoir exhibit -- catch it if you can.A free audio guide is offered; we found it particularly informative. It descibes many features of the mansion as well as selected art works. There are also a couple of good introductory free films available in the \"Music Room.\"Put The Frick on your \"must see\" list; you won't be sorry."

The Frick has a \"pay what you want\" approach on Sundays between 11-1. New Yorkers and tourists alike seem to know about it because the line stretched for 2 blocks. But once inside, you're treated to a great museum experience. Get yourself the audio guide so you can learn about paintings at your own pace. Or take advantage of the large art paper and pencils so you can do your own sketching. Right now, there is a Renoir exhibit. It's only 9 paintings but they are displayed so that you can really enjoy them. The polite guards make sure the room does not get too full (which means another line to get in) but worth the wait."

It is housed in the magnificent mansion that he built on Fifth Avenue. The collection contains many wonderful paintings by Vermeer, Degas, Hoblein the Younger, Fragonard, and Renoir plus lovely sculpture, furniture, and porcelain. Wandering around the museum gives you a glimpse of how the extremely wealthy lived in early 20th century NYC. The entrance fee is pricey, but it is still worth a visit.

There are so many masterpieces of European art up through the Impressionists that are world famous and reproduced in so many art books that a visitor forgets that their home is here instead of the Met. The inner courtyard with its fountain is a great place to rest one's feet and back. The self audio guide is just the right length for each picture and it's free.

If I only had a chance to go to one or two art institutions, the Frick would not be on the top of my list but if you have never gone, a it is a wonderful building filled with beautiful furnishings, and art treasures. To really appreciate the galleries, first sit and watch the film, join a guided tour, and take time to sit in the inside garden/ fountain area. They also have special events so if you are interested in going, check out their site ahead of time. My ninety two year old mother loved the museum and didn't understand why she really did not know about it as she is a regular at art museums.

We visited most recently during the exhibition of a Velazquez portrait of Phillip IV. While most exhibitions advertised up and down Park Ave. consist of dozens of paintings, this exhibition was a single portrait. While the portrait was undoubtedly marvelous, we were in and out in about an hour, building in time to see the rest of the Frick collection. The Frick is fantastic for those days when you do not have enough time to go to a museum as engrossing as the Met or MOMA, or even the Guggenheim or Whitney, but still want a dose of world-class art."

Now I returned decades later on the last day of 2011 with my teenage daughter, who was as delighted and impressed as I had been. One after another, the paintings are what you find in textbooks, but with the vividness and warmth of real life, in real rooms. Admittedly the rooms are not exactly what we'd have at home, but most are furnished spaces, not galleries. Every visitor has his or her favorites: mine is Frick's own sitting room, with Hans Holbein's \"Sir Thomas More\" and Bellini's \"St. Francis in Ecstacy\" as well as two exquisite Titians. My daughter loved the over-the-top Fragonard room, finding it delightful and really funny on close inspection. They also often have impressive special exhibitions: we saw one on Picasso's drawings. Very worthwhile visit. Note: children under 10 are not admitted, due to the many precious and breakable objects around the building."

However, have to say, not only was the property as impressive as expected,but the collection is delightful.

Let me dispense with with its few negatives first-none that should prevent you from going: 1) Children under 10 are banned from the lovely premises 2) The 15 dollar admission (at most hours)is rather steep. 3) The guards are one multi-headed scowl who impart nothing to the experience. Admittedly a warped domestic terrorist attempted to kill Mr Frick at his business offices but that was 125 years ago and we art afficinados are unarmed-honest, guys<g>Now for the positives. The converted mansion is a lovely setting with comfortable public seating around a lovely fountain where the strains of a luncheon piano recital soothingly play from a nearby room. The rest may not be necessary because the Collection is a perfect blend of incredible masterpieces and a lovely, manageable setting that can be traversed in 2-3 hrs. at a leisurely pace. This allows the tourist a charming respite, a short stroll through Central Park across the street and still time for dinner and a play. Seeking art emersion? The Met and the Guggenheim are both less than a 15 minute walk straight up the street to augment this must-see stop. The stunning St Jerome by El Greco, Bellini's St Francis of Assisi, several extraordinary Vermeers with coquettish young ladies and ardent visitors,Two Holbeins \"with a story\" Rembrandts, early Turners, Goya, Velasquez, Chardin, lovely ladies portrayed by Whistler, lovelyill-fated Lady Hamilton by Romney, a charming Renoir are just a few of the selections that show off Mr Fricke's flawless taste in rooms large and small. However, note that it is all representative art. Nothing later than the Impressionists.However, MOMA, The Guggenheim, the Whitney all represent the various schools of modern art and are within walking distance. Dont miss The Frick-a most unique and memorable NYC gem!"

The Frick started its life as the private collection of a wealthy industrialist Henry Clay Frick, a prominent steel magnate from Pittsburgh who later moved to New York City. Like many other captains of industry turned philanthropist, Frick founded a museum and donated his art acquisitions to the public upon his death. The building itself is right near Central Park and other prominent art museums such as the Met.The museum has an excellent collection of Rococo furniture and paintings. Like the earlier Baroque, this style includes great attention to light, darkness, color and detail but adds more sensuous colors in paintings and creamy pastel ornaments in architecture and interior decor. Among the highlights are many thematic works of the 18th century French painter Francois Boucher such as the Four Seasons and the Arts & Sciences series featuring classical allegories of various disciplines. The paintings, furniture and decor blend together in an organic manner to create a cozy, convincing environment in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Other prominent exhibitions include works by Van Dyck, British portrait artist Gainsborough and Italian Renaissance master Veronese. The museum contains enough unique works by great masters to make it is well worth at least one trip despite the presence of a far larger collection a few blocks away.Admissions is a reasonable $15.00 for the general public $5.00 for students."

We spent the day in NYC and started off at the Frick. Located on Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, in a mostly residential area--it is just slightly off the beaten touristy track--which is certainly a welcome change. We went on a Saturday, getting there before noon. Lo and behold, the street parking in this area is pretty decent. We were fortunate enough to get a parking space and noticed there were quite a bit of open spaces, just around the corner from the entrance.The Collection is amazing. A nice mix of different painters. Vermeer, Boucher, Ingres, Renior...just to name a few. Rooms are a beautiful and tasteful mix of different periods. My favorite was a room that was done in Louis XV, brought me back to my visits to Versailles! A collection of Picasso drawings was on display and, even if you aren't a huge fan of Picasso, it was worth going to see because it gives you a chance to see what a remarkable artist he really was. Not ALL of his works are abstract--which was a pleasant gift for those of us not enthralled by abstract art. Visiting the Frick makes for an extremely relaxing way to view some beautiful art and objects d'art. Also...if you aren't a fan of overwhelming and crowded museums, the Frick gives you a chance to enjoy great art at a slower and less crowded pace. It kind of reminded me of the National Gallery in DC--only at a more personal level. You don't need multiple trips and all can be covered in a couple of hours! If you like art--but just don't feel like dealing with the crowds at the Met (on weekends), by all means, check out the Frick Collection. It is a wonderful look at a private collection (even though some of the works are on loan from other museums) and just a nice pleasant couple of hours. A nice way to while away some time!Thank you for reading my review. I hope if you are in NYC, you really take some time to enjoy this collection."

His Fifth Avenue mansion is now filled with what can only be said is the most exquisite collection of furniture, sculpture and paintings anywhere outside a major museum. Indeed better than most. The great advantage is that being in a 'house' however grand, the steps from room to room bring one into contact with all types of clessical art. The paintings by Vermeer and Ingres always inspire us, yet the Gainsborough's bring the golden age oF England to the fore."

The normal entrance fee is $18 and I had intended to pay $15 - I offered the pay clerk a $20 bill (not having any other change). This was taken without asking if I intended to pay the full $20 with a look that was so intimidating that I didn't dare ask for change!The Frick has a bizarre rule that if you remove your coat for any reason, you have to check it in. I arrived on a cold morning and combined with that and a massive line for coat check, I kept my coat on. During my visit, I became warm and draped my coat around my shoulders - during the one minute that it took me to remove it and then put it round my shoulders, I was shouted (and I mean shouted) at by two members of staff to put my coat on or check it! If the rule is to prevent people with coats over their arm stealing property and concealing it beneath their coat - maybe they should ask that rucksacks are checked in (rather than banging into other visitors all the time!)I asked another member of staff for directions to the rest room - I was given a look that would cut glass and was disdainfully pointed in the general direction; she did not have the courtesy to speak to me!The final straw was in one of the rooms - I was standing approximately 2 feet from a window, admiring the view into the garden. There were no exhibits within arms length yet one of the attendants decided to tell me to move away from the window by snapping his fingers at me! Not having the manners to speak to me to ask me to move, he decided to treat me as a pet dog!The house is beautiful and the exhibits interesting but my visit was ruined by rude and ignorant staff. I would never return there and would not recommend anyone else to do so it they have any shred of self-respect!"

I adore the Metropolitan Museum of Art, have a great time at MOMA (the Museum of Modern Art) and the Guggenheim and the other NYC museums, but I have to say that my new favorite is the Frick Collection. I had been there years ago and loved it back then, but honestly had forgotten about it until recently. The current Picasso Drawings exhibit brought me there this time, but its permanent collection housed in structural masterpiece is totally unbelievable and well worth any visit! The Frick Collection is located in a superb mansion built by the controversial industrialist Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919). Though he was a questionable character, his taste in art was impeccable. There are 16 galleries of paintings by some of the world's greatest masters including Vermeer, Rembrandt, El Greco, Titian, Degas, Goya, Turner Van Dyke, Gainsborough and Renoir. The Rembrandts and Vermeers were truly out of this world! Each room at the Frick is magnificent but somehow intimate as well, giving you the feel that you are in someone's real home. At every turn is another take-your-breath-away surprise, including the serene Garden Court where you can pause and listen to the soothing fountain and look up towards the skylight.The Frick is just off of 5th Avenue and across from Central Park, and is a perfect respite from a busy day and a great place to whisk you back into time where you can pretend that you are a wealthy magnate with one of the most amazing art collections in the world."

While a small collection it includes paintings by Rembrandt, Bellini, Holbein, Gainsborough, Constable and many other renowned artists. In addition, it exhibits furniture, porcelain, sculpture, etc. The mansion and most of the art were donated to New York by Henry Frick. Portraits of Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell by Hans Helbein are situated on opposing sides of the same wall representing their relationship in life. Be sure not to miss this wonderful collection.TIP: Use the free recording device which provides interesting information of selected pieces."

The Frick Collection is interesting because it is not only a museum with fine works of art, but also the house of Henry Clay Frick , an early 20th Century industrialist. Frick was not born to money, but worked his way up from a clerk to the owner of coke mines in Western Pennsylvania. As coke was used in the manufacture of steel, he went into business with Andrew Carnegie and became extremely wealthy. After a bitter strike and a breakup with Carnegie, he moved to New York and became an art collector. The house at 70th Street was built not only as a home, but also as a gallery to house a pretty spectacular art collection. It was always Frick's intention to turn his house into a museum after his death. And an impressive collection of art it is. But the nice thing about it, is that it is manageable. You can spend a very pleasant couple of hours viewing art in comfortable surroundings, and not be totally overwhelmed, like at the MET. Definitely a little gem and worth your time."

And that audio guide is one of the best I've ever encountered. Easy to use and full of useful but not too fancy information. You just walk around and punch in the number of the artwork you want to see, and presto - a one minute explanation in simple English. Oh, and did I mention that the artworks are fabulous?

But the museum was disappointing in several other ways. Unlike at the MOMA, you had to pay extra for an audio device and there was a dearth of information offered.

Last year while I was in Paris I decided to visit a couple of the smaller galleries and found the collections superb so on my trip to New York this month I thought I'd do the same and bypass the big museums and have a look at some smaller ones like the Frick. The art was mesmerising and the size of the collection was perfect as I find that after 3 or 4 hours looking at paintings i lose a bit of perspectice and don't really sak it in and that didn't happen here. There was plenty to see but not so much that it loses meaning. I've since read a bit about the Mt Frick who establised the collection and it turns out he wasn't a very nice guy at all but hats off to his selection of art works as he and those who have furthered the collection since his death have done a great job."

The location on Central Park East also makes it an excellent activity before Sunday brunch/lunch at the Central Park Boathouse.

If you admire Old Master paintings, as well as European masterpieces by Turner & Gainsborough, you must visit the Frick Collection."

The museum, formerly known as the Henry Clay Frick House, was the New York City residence of steel magnate Henry Clay Frick. The neoclassical mansion was built between 1913 and 1914 and was designed by Thomas Hastings. Wandering about you will find gardens, fountains, exceptional woodwork, fine furniture, decorative items, and Oriental rugs that weave a wonderful tapestry of how the super-rich of the Gilded Age lived. The furnishings of the mansion impart a sense of beauty and craftsmanship seldom seen today. I often find myself staring at the walls and ceilings of every room marveling at the wonderful woodwork and trim. The west side of the mansion faces Central Park and creates a sense of dignified and quiet solitude that belies its presence in one the busiest cities in the world.While the mansion is opulent and beautiful the artwork it contains is even more precious. You will see some of the very best works by some of the very best old master painters; El Greco, Goya, Holbein, Van Dyck, Vel\u00e1zquez, and Whistler just to name a few. Every painting is lovingly arranged and every room has a character and life of its own. While the mansion is hardly small, it feels intimate and can be reasonably appreciated in a couple of hours."

Banishing children and providing limited explanatory texts on its wall, \u201cThe Frick\u201d aims at more serious art aficionados relative to other general exhibitors elsewhere in the city. Like the J.P. Morgan Library and Museum, The Frick used to be sumptuous private digs and with its indoor fountain garden and grand, gilded rooms, it is quite the sight to behold. This serious space focuses on serious works particularly 15th century Dutch masters and their darkly rendered large scale portraiture. The solemnity of the collection is such that a brightly-colored Renoir of a mother and two daughters comes as a welcome relief as guests encountered it in a hallway (not quite the place of honor). The impressionist master does better than Rembrandt, however, who finds his many, many, many self-portraits hung in the crowded, small, airless lower floor (cellar?). Those holding MFA\u2019s or otherwise knowledgeable about art or fans of interiors will love The Frick but the more general museum-goer will be better served elsewhere."

Then take a trip to the Frick Collection at 1 East 70 Th Street and Fifth Avenue opposite Central Park.This amazing collection was formed by Henry Clay Frick (1849 \u2013 1919), a well known industrialist, and is housed in his New York home, a mansion in the European style of the 18th century. The rooms remind you of English & French interiors of this period.You enter the building via the main door on East 70th Street. This brings you into a beautiful entrance hall and then into a Reception Hall, where you can leave your coat and pick up a guide to the House, there is also a Museum Shop right next door. There are twenty rooms to visit in all, including a Garden Court, which is really a Winter Garden with a pool and fountain, a nice place to relax when you need a rest. There is a suggested order to visit the rooms, but you can in fact visit them in any order, they are all on the ground floor. Most of the rooms contain important paintings, furniture, clocks and porcelain and have the names and functions from Mr Frick\u2019s time. I started out in the Hall and walked through to the Boucher Room, named after the French 18th Century painter. This room contains eight large paintings by Boucher arranged round the room with a theme of Arts & Sciences. Apart from the paintings there is a spectacular writing table by Jean \u2013 Henri Riesener, one of the best cabinet makers of the 18th Century. There is also some very fine Sevres porcelain and the overall feel is like being in a wonderful French chateau. After visiting the Boucher room, I moved on to the Dining Room, here all the paintings are English by Hogarth, Reynolds, Gainsborough and Hoppner. In contrast to the Boucher Room, where the feeling is of a French room, this room is very English and typical of a grand Country House. As I moved from one room to the next, a feeling of excitement grew and I was not disappointed.I cannot cover all the rooms in this article, however one other room you must see is The West Gallery as it is without doubt the most amazing room of all. There cannot be many rooms in a Private House anywhere with such a spectacular collection. I marvelled at one great painting after another, you can see Corot, Van Dyck, Van Ruisdael, Turner, Hals, Hobbema, Constable, Lorrain, Veronese, David, Rembrandt, De la Tour, Goya, Cuyp, Vermeer, Velazquez and El Greco. Another good reason for visiting the Frick is that you can visit the collection in a relatively short time, say an hour and a half, whereas a visit to the Metropolitan Museum takes considerably longer even if you are only seeing part of the collection. Do go, you will have a great time, I guarantee it!"

Having just trashed the Morgan Library, I shall shower praise upon what I believe to be one of the world's two best small museums (the other is the Wallace Collection in London). Though far smaller than the Met, the Frick boasts a far higher average quality of painting. Nearly everything in it is a masterpiece or a near miss.Better still, because a single man assembled the vast majority of the collection, the individual works create a cohesive whole that elevates the emotional impact of the works. This museum has an individual personality that no mega-museum assembled by hundreds of curators can match. And that personality belongs to Henry Clay Frick.Apparently Frick was a hard and ruthless man of business, but he clearly had a soft and joyful side that expresses itself in his collection. You'll find almost no art of hardship and privation at the Frick. Instead, you'll see work after work designed to remind you how joyful life can be. The women are beautiful. The men are dashing. The landscapes are elegant.And then there's the building that houses the collection, which served as Frick's private residence and has been largely preserved as he left it. It is an astonishingly beautiful place and as you wander about it, you can imagine what life might have been like for a turn-of-the-century Robber Barron.One complaint I've seen leveled against the Frick here is that it's expensive ($18 as of December, 2009) but I will point out that admission includes a very good audio guide that costs and extra $7 at most museums. If that's too rich for your blood, go on Sunday mornings and pay what you wish for admission and audio guide. One warning: If you go on Sunday morning, expect crowds."

We saw works by Titian, Degas, Renoir and more. The free audio guide is amazing and really adds a important dimension to the viewing experience. My dad was initially hesitant to try the audio guide but later told me that he was so glad that I persuaded him to try it. If you have only 2 hours to see a museum and are looking for a place where you won't feel overwhelmed, check out the Frick. I'm so so glad that we went.

The free audio in English is a must and i would have paid 100 dollars to see this collection. It's world class.I paid 15 dollars i think but on Sunday, it's pay what you like, so you could get in for 1 dollar.If i ever life in NYC, i will spend all my weekends in this magical place... and i don't even like Art Galleries that much...Everyone will love the Frick collection. Massive highlight was the Thomas Moore portrait (can't remember artist) and the Whistlers.DO IT DO IT DO IT!!!!!"

The colllection here is fabulous and although the museum is small, there is a lot to see and it is all without exception of the best quality. The added bonus here is the setting, the collection is housed in the Mansion owned by the collections owner and hung beautifully in graceful rooms. If you love art, don't miss this collection!"

In Paris also the Andr\u00e9 Jacquemard Collection is impressive and both are presented in particular hotels having belonged to the Family. What an emotion. If you can, go to the Frick Collection on sunday morning, between 11am and 1pm, you pay what you want ...."

The collection is amazing, even if you are not an art expert, you can appreciate the beauty and talent. That it's housed in a restored mansion is an extra bonus. No photography inside is the only negative. Will definitely go back next time I'm here with a 'non-museum' person."

My favorite New York City art museum is the Frick.I like its outstanding quality of paintings and its cozy atmosphere.This smaller New York City art museum has splendid collections of paintings by Vermeer,Boucher,Fragonard,Van Dyck,and Whistler.It has a fine collection of early Italian paintings(Duccio,Piero Della Francesca,Cimabue).It has a fine collection of French Limoges enamels(Leonard Limousin).It has delightful British portraiture(Gainesborough,Reynolds,Hogarth).Personal favorites were;Cimabue's\"Flagellation\",Constable's\"Salisbury Church\",and Monet's\"Vethieul in Winter\".So enrich yourself at this less discovered New York City gem."

            "review": "Do not miss this stunning museum. I visited the Frick last Tuesday with my two teenaged kids. They're reluctant museum goers so I wanted to go someplace that wasn't overwhelming and had heard the Frick is a manageable size. It's also about the only opportunity you have to see a Gilded Age mansion. Fifth Avenue was lined with sumptuous homes then, the \"real\" homes as opposed to the \"cottages\" you see in Newport, RI. But real estate on Fifth Avenue was too valuable for many of them to survive so this is a chance to see the works of art within and the work of art that houses them.The museum is beautifully laid out, the rooms gorgeous, the painting and sculptures well displayed. The audio guide (free with admission) is excellent, offering interesting backstories for most of the works. While we were there the Collection's three Vermeers were hung together so you can truly appreciate his genius in full.My kids didn't want to visit a museum and only went because we had agreed to do \"something for everyone\" - shopping, Spamalot, etc. But they were very impressed with the museum and seeing these incredible works of great masters up close. And just when your kids would get sick and tired and overwhelmed with a museum you're through the Frick and back out into its gorgeous courtyard.My kids zone out in vast museums like the Met, but they talked about what they'd seen in the Frick a lot afterward. It's a very palatable dose of culture for teens and a wonderful art fix for their shopped-out parents!"

Friends had urged me to visit this place at all costs, and it really is well worth spending half a day in this opulent former mansion to appreciate one of the greatest personal collections of fine art in the world. If the Metropolitan Museum daunts you by its sheer scale, the intimacy of the Frick comes like a breath of fresh air."

            "review": "Highly recommended - definitely worth a visit. This is great little gallery which I would highly recommend. If you are not planning a particularly cultural trip but would quite like to visit a gallery this is one not to be missed. The collection is contained in a beautiful house with an indoor garden area where you can sit afterwards and reflect upon what you have seen. I personally thought the collection itself is a great size - not too big so you can properly appreciate all the artworks - good if like me the larger galleries leave you feeling slightly overwhelmed. There is a free audio guide which works on the system by which each painting has a number adjacent to it - you key this number into the guide it tells you about that particular piece. This is great because it leaves you explore the gallery at your leisure. I paid the very reasonable student rate of $5 dollars but it is definitely worth a visit at the full price of $15 and on Sundays from 11.00 till 1.00 you can visit and pay what you wish. As for the art wok there are Gainsboroughs, Constables, and Whilsters to name but a few and all tastefully displayed in the ornate rooms. Go see it!!"

            "review": "Mixed feelings. The collection is interesting, but don't expect seeing too many pictures or statues. It's 1 floor only. The 2nd floor was closed. I felt $15 for this was just too much. Also, it was strange they charge you $1 if you want to get 1 print-out to read more about he museum - it's usually completely free at other museums. They have audio guides in French, Italian etc., but not in Russian. Russian is one of the top world languages, far more important than French or Italian nowadays, so I don't understand why it was not available. (I am not Russian, I can speak 7 languages so it's not a problem for me to get another language version, it was just strange for me). Another con - very limited # of seats in the galleries - just couple of chairs - it is very difficult for pregnant women or elder people to stand all the time. You can see antique chairs all over the place, but of course you can't use them, however, for $15 there should be more seats available. Yes, you can sit down in the garden hall, but there only are marble benches that are very cold. Well, I would not return to this museum although I liked the art shown there, the whole house, however, was not inviting at all. Didn't get a good impression overall."

If you have only a limiterd time in New York City and want to view some of the best art in the world, the Frick Collection is the place to go! Everything from Rembrandt to Whistler.

By far, this is one of the most impressive yet unique collection of old European artists---Renoir, Vermeer, Velasquez, Goya, Boucher, Ruebens, Van Dyck, etc...The free audio tour is incredible too. A 20 minute movie at the end of the collection complements the entire experience. This is a must see in NYC!!"

While I agree that the staff is very unfriendly and stern, I do believe the security people all over the musuem are necessary to ensure visitors can continue to enjoy the relaxed, home-like feel to the collection (Instead of putting everything behind glass.) The house is beautiful, the art interesting and covering a wide variety of movements. Go on a Sunday between 11 and 1 and you can pay what you wish to enter."

Your visit will take only about an hour and the old master paintings are some of the best to be seen in America. The building is the former residence of Mr. Frick and is typical of a millionaire's residence at the turn of the last century- plenty of polished marble and wood. It would cost a fortune to build this today!"

I acknowledge our troubled times, but it seemed the security guards within were unpleasant, superfluous and overbearing and definitely tainted my visit. I made the mistake of carrying my jacket on my arm, and in a very brusque manner, was told to carry it on my shoulders by one attendant. I suppose someone must have once walked off with one of their ugly bronzes. (Perhaps if they are so concerned about this they could glue them to the pretentious Louis IV bombes?) I felt the weight of the \"guards\" constantly looking over my shoulder and spent much less time at this gallery (and money in the gift shop) than I had intended. I'd advise tourists to visit the Met instead and avoid the Frick until they realize patrons would rather be welcomed than frowned upon."

The owners live upstairs and shair the downstairs beautiful art collection. We as seniors paid $8 and enjoyed the original's. Even Rambrant's works. We then walked across Central Park and had a wonderful lunch at the Boat House Restaurant. What a great day!!"
