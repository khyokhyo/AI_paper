All the people who are working here really putting their soul in what they are doing, and you can learn a lot about the hospitality and the local culture. We took our family who were visiting us for the first time in Dubai-and they really enjoy the atmosphere, the idea and the concept. I really need to say thank you to all the people who are working here and make it such a great place. All of them go above the line.This is a good place to visit if you want to learn about local culture, there is no wrong questions you can ask and you can expand your knowledge about UAE."

I will be bringing all my guests here when they visit. Be sure to know exactly where you are going before you hop in a taxi, have the map on your phone ready as I was surprised none of the taxi drivers we spoke to knew where it was located and be sure to carve out several hours for the tour of the Mosque, etc. since we only had enough time for the educational luncheon. Also be sure to call in advance to reserve your seating for the luncheon or breakfast. Enjoy!"

The food that is served here is like a royal meal. Also the kahwa and the dates served in the beginning is awesome. The camels in this area take you to all the alleys and around the area. And the beautiful mosque surely gives you a purely cultural visit with the backdrop of the creek with all the Abra and yatch around. A must visit here to have a feel of the ancient dubai."

All staff and volunteers very friendly and so welcoming. Tour very informative and lots of laughs very relaxed and was only 3 others on tour so time for questions. I learnt a lot about Emerati tradition, history and Muslim traditions. Specially prepared Emerati feast for lunch probably some of the best food in Dubai. Hospitality beautiful. We did the morning tour then the lunch. The mosque so beautiful. Dressing in traditional clothes great fun and a way to see what it is like. A tip on getting there... Like going anywhere in Dubai make sure you know exactly where you are going as taxi drivers not likely to know. We got the metro red line from Mall of the Emerites then got off at BurJurman station to change to green line to get to Al Fahidi stop. Then take the south exit and walk pretty much straight ahead for 10 minutes. Or just get a cab from the start but I really like the metro here. The app MapsMe works a treat. This is a must do in Dubai."

To see how they constructed the \"wind houses\" and did the layout of the town to take advantage of the wind and to allow for privacy. The most important part of the experience were the explanations of the guide and her ability to answer our questions, even those that were somewhat sensitive politically.We ended by having tea and dates in the SMCC building with time for more questions."

            "review": "Informative experience. Attended the breakfast session at SMCCU in order to learn more about the Islamic/Emirati culture. Even though i have been living in dubai for 5 years, this was the first time i visited the SMCCU. When planning your trip, you have to take into account that breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner is not served everyday. Each have specific days and times they take place, thus if you decide to just swing by for a spur of the moment visit you might end up being too late or too early... It is best to call in advance or go to the website and confirm times (and availability). Prices vary depending on the meal you attend and breakfast is priced at 80aed per person. You can also book private meals at a time of your choosing (minimum 10 pax). The main Emirati presenter was well spoken (english) and he had a good sense of humor (but obviously my interpretation and your interpretation of 'good sense of humor' might differ). There were two young gentleman and to ladies that assisted him with explanations/demonstrations. A wide range of topics were covered in the roughly 45minute long session. At the end of this session you can help yourself to a traditional breakfast. The food is by no means five star quality (but at 80aed you get way better than what you pay for!!!), but it is very tasty, traditional and more than enough for everyone (at the end of the session they provide take away containers if you feel like taking food home with you). There was no specific order except for ladies first, luckily we were a small group of only about 10 pax, otherwise if might have been a bit chaotic. I would suggest maybe starting at one point or doing section by section. During and after breakfast participants are encouraged to ask any and as many questions as they like. The presenter was very open and honest in his replies... But he did do a very good job of not answering certain questions by steering off topic. This was most likely done in order to avoid tension or arguments. Common sense is important... The idea is to have an open/pleasant discussion and learn about the culture, not create tension or argue! This will ruin the experience for the other participants. (Like i have read in some other reviews, luckily no such issues during my experience). The whole experience was about 1h25m long and i learned a lot. I would highly recommend this experience to anyone and everyone!"

As I have travelled a lot outside Dubai, I appreciate the history, culture and architecture a city has to offer. Being in the center made me feel like a tourist! :D you get the feel of the arabian hospitality through the casual talks with your guide, the food that you get served with and everything about the center makes you really feel that you are having an arabian experience.Needless to say I wish I had known about this so I could have taken my friends who were visiting me from other countries and have shown them on of the many unique experiences that Dubai has to offer.Must do while in Dubai.. together with a desert safari and a falcon show!"

I felt that the presenter did a good job to explain aspects of Islam in a way that was entertaining and lighthearted up to a point. While we were in the mosque, I posed a question asking the presenter whether Sunni and Shi'a Muslims attended the same mosques during prayer services. The answer that I received was that they do and it was only because of President G.W. Bush's decision to intervene in the Middle East was when the friction between the Shi'a and Sunni Muslims started. I was not in favor of the U.S. invasion of Iraq nor quite a number of President Bush's foreign policies, but to be told that a centuries-old disagreement between the Shi'a and Sunni Muslims occurred as the result of President Bush's invasion of Iraq and was the root cause of the turmoil between the two sects undermined the presenter's good faith efforts to inform and to provide cultural understanding, which was very disappointing."

The tour was very informative - it was fascinating to hear about traditional building materials, construction and design, and the two local hosts (one male, one female) were very knowledgeable but also very relaxed and friendly, happy to go \"off script\" and talk about Emirati culture and life in Dubai in general. The food at the brunch was very nice (and filling!) - I was particularly happy to see that they package the leftovers and distribute them to workers, as there was a lot left after we all ate our fill! I volunteered to be dressed in local ladies' attire, and to hear about the origins of some of their clothes and customs was very interesting. The hosts were also very forthright and honest in answering our questions, which I really appreciated. I would definitely recommend!TIP: parking around the area can be difficult to come by (we were dropped off by my husband).

I will be taking all future visitors, friends, family here when they come to visit me in Dubai.Everyone I know that has been here has only had positive things to say about it.If you want to make a day of it, you are close by to the Dubai Museum and the Souks as well.It is the kind of thing you can do several times as well, so a great option if you are a Resident and you need some ideas to entertain your visitors!"

Set amongst a cluster of a few minor galleries and specialized museums (art & coins) as well as some government offices & workshops (calligraphy) and a lovely (exterior) mosque near the Creek in Bur Dubai, this modest site provided some very enlightening information about Islam, about the country of and people in Dubai, the local food and customs and more. Our session was lead by a pair of traditionally dressed young people: a college woman and high school man. They brought enthusiasm, openness and knowledge as well as a moderate dose of national pride to the encounter. We learned a variety of social and religious (Islamic) details and nuances. The presenters and we visitors all sat on the floor with a magnificent variety of traditional breakfast items set out in the middle of our U-shaped formation.The presentation probably went about 45 mins. before we were invited to, without any suggested order of approach, dig in. This made for a somewhat chaotic few moments, but courtesy won out as people attempted to take samplings and then move on without knocking each other over or causing plates of food to be upended.We found the experience worthwhile and would recommend it as an early part of your first visit to Dubai. As for the cost, we paid $22/ea for the 10 AM breakfast session; so perhaps is not for people on a really tight budget, but nonetheless, it would be money well spent for any newcomer. BTW, the session was done in English."

WARNING We went in April (not the height of summer) and the walk from the Textile Souk to the Al Fahidi District was a killer in the heat. However, you will pass by the Dubai Museum and while your time away in and around the Bastakiya.The volunteer speaker was a middle-aged man (forgot his name) and he was quite enthusiastic. He told us to ask anything under the sun and some of us did. A lady asked him about the multi-wives they were allowed and then asked personally whether he himself had more than 1 wife... Everyone laughed and he was open enough with it. The topics ranged from the inane, the mundane and to the controversial. The main dishes weren't excellent (chicken biryani was the best), but the bread ball (?) with the date sauce was a big hit.The lunch was 1.5 hours, which was a good length, esp with the discussions going around."

The buildings were beautifully constructed and amazingly well restored and preserved. The entire complex was absolutely clean and fresh, straight out of a story book. I was very impressed. At the end of the tour, we were invited to share some Arabic coffee and dates. A truly wonderful experience."

While wandering around the site we were lucky enough to stumble upon Dahlia, who suggested we came to the cultural talk and lunch she was leading. We found it an incredibly edifying experience. She spoke about the background to Islam - the customs, the dress and how it fits with modern life of an Amerati (native of the United Arab Emirates). We had a long question and answer session both during and after lunch and were told no question would be off limits.The lunch was also excellent - different curries and a dessert of the local baby dumplings doused in a date syrup. We had been served the local Arab coffee and told it was impolite not to drink it!We now understand much more about the Amerati and their Muslim way of life."

The center is in a nice pedestrian area called Al Fahidi, full of \"historical\" houses (they don't have more than 70 years...), however they don't have even 1 indication about where they are!! We drove crazy trying to find it, and when finally we gave up, the center suddenly appears!! We did 2 activities, the Heritage Tour (1.5 hour, 65AED) and the Brunch (2 hours, 100EAD). The heritage tour, consist on 30 min of answering our questions about culture, religion, history, etc... and 1 hour walk arround the disctirc and finally 30 min in a mosk talking more in depth about religion. The quality of this tour depends in a big part on the people from the group, the type of questions they do and how long are the answer of the guide. In my case, our group didn't do many questions so there were a lot of moment of silence...The brunch last 2 hours and is all the time in the center. The food was amazing (really, one of the best I tried in Dubai) and they provide you some tuppers if you want to take with you. During the brunch, the sessions consits on the same, just asking questions. The problem here is that we were in the previous tours and most of the questions were the same. In that case the group asked for more questions but at the end it was more of the same.Among this 2 activities, I recommend to attend just to the brunch (or any of the Cultural Meals)."

I went there with my daughter who lives in Dubai and wanted to help me understand the cultural and historical heritage of the area. We visited the site in a group and were allocated a very well informed and versatile guide. He told us about the beginning of the settlement starting with the bedouins of the desert who traveled for days to come to the creek in Dubai for water, showed us what he called the first natural air conditioning system in a dwelling up to the modern day architectural landmarks that everybody knows. What was remarkable about this guide, apart from his impressive knowledge of his subject, was that he was willing to answer any question about some sensitive issues with humour and frankness. During our visit to the mosque he explained why the men worship on one side and the women are on the other side and many other questions as well as providing some very interesting facts about the healing properties of camel milk. After the tour we were given a sample of Arab hospitality when we were invited in a large room, where we sat on comfortable cushions, were treated to strong coffee, sweets and dates and more friendly banter from our guide. Although the price of the tickets was not cheap, I would recommend this visit to everybody who wants to get a glimpse into the history and culture of Dubai."

Upon completion of this eccentric presentation, the police decided to award one of the lunch's participants with a free trip to Zanzibar (no joke) once the group awkardly fumbled its way through a weird competition to name important elements that a tourist city needs (like... police!).After this weird experience, we began our conversation (for cultural understanding) with one person asking about local racism and another person asking about the high number of deaths of foreign workers. Our hostess quickly became irritated and uncomfortable and after that, our 'conversation' deteriorated to a decent amount of argumentation between the hostess and the parts of the group. She was certainly friendly and outgoing though - and provided interesting insights into the city, local culture, and geopolitics.Overall, I hope your experience doesn't involve unsolicited propaganda from the local police, but we still had a pretty good time just taking in the spectacle before us. However, for the amount of money they charged us, it was a bit much. Certainly, as was made clear to us, this experience is made or broken by the group of people that attends; be forewarned.Also, I should add that the food was fairly forgettable."

The food and drinks served were delicious, and there was plenty to go round. It was a bit tricky to find the centre, the taxi driver didn't seem to know where to drop us off, he eventually left us at the museum but we then had to double back on ourselves to get to the cultural centre. Tip, leave yourself enough time to get there. Would highly recommend, we will definitely go back."

We then have sone questions and answers, and also back at the cultural centre where we have arabic coffee, water and dates. I also had a cultural Emirati meal there costing 80AED each,well worth it, and once again questions and answers. The young emirati women and voluntary workers, most are pretty, and intellectual and very informative. I personally was quite amazed at the openness of these young ladies and certainly do not appear intimidated by the questions asked. Wallid the Director enjoys his role explaining the emirati culture.

She explained to us the different areas of the mosque, what happens during the prayers and then talked about the teaching pillars of the Islam religion and how it is practiced in Dubai. Following on from this there was time for questions.

We then went to a mosque and our guide spoke of the Muslim faith. We also had our lunch there. This was our best Middle Eastern themed meal for the whole trip (the ones we had at our desert safari and dhow cruise did not compare at all). We had salad, stew, pastry and Turkish coffee, all cooked so well.

However, I later found out that my 9 year old could attend free of charge so make sure you indicate this if you have children and are booking through Expedia. The Center is located in a large complex of buildings. Our taxi driver did not know the exact location and dropped us off on the other side of the complex. While trying to find the location we ran into other attendees doing the same. The location is along the road. There is a small parking lot in front of the building and the Center name on the outside of the building so keep your eyes open as you drive there. The building number is 26 and all of the buildings are numbered so walk in the direction of the buildings in the 20's and you should find it shortly. There were about 12 people attending this lecture. We all sat on pillows. We chose to sit a little back of the group due to our 9 year olds' limited attention span. However, he paid attention throughout the entire lecture and meal. The meal was delicious with a good variety including a meat stew, rice dishes, salad, dates and dessert. Drinks provided included Arabic coffee, tea and water. At the end of the discussion we could take food with us in provided containers. As we finished eating, the lecturer, an Emerati college student, allowed us to ask any questions we wanted about the Emirates and Islam. She was more than willing to give us her honest perspective as she answered. The entire visit lasted from 1:00pm to 2:30pm.There were clean, Western style toilets available and the sitting area is air-conditioned. I definitely recommend this experience while in Dubai. It provides a nice counterweight to the malls and other attractions for which Dubai is better known for."

For a start, you can visit a mosque and have all the internal workings explained. Next, you can join in for a cultural breakfast or lunch - an authentic Emirati meal- which even the expats living in Dubai don't get. To top it all, the centre's openness is reflected in the Q&A during and after the meal in which all your questions, whether it be a taboo subject or not, will be answered by a friendly and knowledgeable guide. And the price for all these events is less than a modest meal in a Dubai hotel. Bookings are essential. My advice - book before you fly because even Dubai residents go there often."

Don't get me wrong about the accents - I find american accents very easy on the ear but we weren't expecting it for this experience.

The visit its totally honest and with no themes or topics restrictions and for a lot of people its a pleasant visit. In my opinion, is not an attraction for everyone and its directed to an audience that looks more for a cultural understanding of the area.

The breakfast is a great way to start your visit to Dubai. People gather for a relaxed breakfast with a local who will answer any question you might have about local customs, culture, religion, etc.. For us no question was off limits and people asked about dating, marriage, families, clothing, politics, food, traditions, islam and many more. Basically you can have all your questions about Dubai/UAE answered before you even see it. In addition you'll have a chance to eat local food (and take some with you if there are leftovers) and try local coffee. You'll get to know a bit about local cuisine in the process. Although the food isn't the highlight of the experience you still have plenty of choices and even people not used to Middle Eastern food will find things to savour.All in all it's well worth spending those two hours enjoying your breakfast and getting to know local culture. Afterwards you can have a stroll in the Bastakia quarter and head to nearby Dubai Creek and cross it with abra (boat) to visit gold souk (market)."

And did you know that women covering their faces has nothing to do with religion and in fact developed because Mohammed's wives (yes, plural!) covered their faces in order to be anonymous in their day to day life. They were married to an extremely important person and were highly regarded and so what they wore became fashionable! The polygamy was also explained brilliantly and left us all nodding are heads in agreement; back in a time when men made money and women stayed at home it was a means to allow rich men to take care of more women during dire times! It is an extremely rare practice nowadays and not allowed in many Muslim countries. Again my dad lied to me all those years ago... What really tickled me was the fact that there are laws in Dubai preventing women from covering their faces in certain work places. In a Muslim country! And England pussy foot around the idea when it became an issue in schools. It was informative and I did not feel at all preached at. I could write an entire essay on the things I learnt and that is without even mentioning the food. The morning tour came with a sit down Arabic coffee with sweet sticky dates. The lunch talk came with an entire feast. It is worth the money just for the meal! Two massive trays of \"Machbus\"(the local equivalent to a Biryani) were the main dishes. One chicken and one veal. Machbus is quite probably the front runner for National Dish if the UAE were ever to choose one. These were accompanied by two pots of lamb curry and two of vegetable curry. All of it not too dissimilar to Indian food. My favourite! The dessert, gladly, was different; round balls of fried dough with date syrup. This place genuinely makes the top spot on my list of things to do in Dubai."

Went into great detail of what we were eating and why. Talked about the clothes worn by the men and women. Answered not only the questions by the people with the TV show but other questions put by the paying visitors."

I had difficulty finding this place, as the the locals I've asked never heard of this place, so they pointed me in the wrong direction, and basically I took a 'scenic' route which took me more than an hour to find, but luckily I left 3 hrs early anticipating of getting lost, which I did. But, it is really a 5 minute walk from Dubai Creek. After getting off the abra (water taxi), make a left and walk along the waterfront past the souks. Food seemed like home-cooked meals, which I was looking forward to: Started off with dates and Arabic coffee. Main course consisted of chicken and lamb biriyani (similar to Indian dish), salad, vegetarian and chicken curry. Dessert was ligamat: deep fried flour balls served with date syrup. There were plenty of leftovers to take home. We all ate Arabian style: shoes off and sat on the floor to eat. Topics discussed: clothing, food, tradition, marriage and dating. It was an open forum and people were encouraged to ask any kind of questions. I even got to try on the Abayah (long, black garment that covers from shoulders down to the feet) with the veil. The shop had the coolest souvenir I got from this trip which is a Western/Arabic calendar with the paintings from students all over Dubai for only 3 USD. Afterwards, take a walk around the Bastakiya area and browse through the shops. Also try a date camel milkshake at one of the cafes. Quite delicious and not too sweet."

My in-laws and I visited the Sheikh Mohammed Center for Cultural Understanding for their cultural breakfast on a weekday in late January, paying 80 AED per person (22 USD, 19 Euro), not including parking.There are a lot of positives for this place. First and foremost, it\u2019s in a traditional Emirati house in the older part of town \u2013 if you want to see what life would have been like decades ago, this is one of the few places in town to do it. Second, during the meal, an Emirati woman explains various aspects of history and culture, answering all manner of questions from guests (including questions on family life, religion, customs, dress, politics, food, and so forth \u2013 nothing seems to be off-limits). Her information is absolutely outstanding and is forthright and honest. Third, the food is typical of what Emiratis would have eaten decades ago and is served in a traditional style. It\u2019s not gourmet, but it\u2019s authentic.There are only two negatives for this place. First, the hostess/guide seemed to be the only Emirati working at the SMCC (front desk staffed by a Westerner, food prepared and tea served by men who appeared to be Indian or Pakistani). It\u2019s disappointing to see the \u201ctypical\u201d Dubai approach \u2013 especially at somewhere dedicated to preserving and explaining local culture. Second, traffic is difficult in this part of the city and parking is nearly impossible. Even a nearby (30m) lot with a sign advertising public parking is not open to the public. I parked on a side street approximately 200m away.Overall, I think the Sheikh Mohammed Center is outstanding. Dubai is short on authentic cultural experiences and the information provided here is great. I\u2019ve been here more than once and I strongly recommend this place to anyone who hasn\u2019t been \u2013 residents or visitors. As a side note, the (very good) Dubai Museum is nearby and could be visited beforehand or afterward. I also recommend Sheikh Saeed\u2019s house nearby as well."

When you arrive you are asked to take off your shoes and you take a seat. You are served Arabian coffee and dates. We were then introduced to our presenters. Both of them were students. The main one talking was a young woman who was in college. The other was a sixteen year old boy. The main presenter was very capable. She answered all the questions asked and was very approachable and I didn't feel like she belittled or talked down to anyone in the slightest way. The problem that I had with the set up of the program was that it was all Q and A. I felt like there should have been some kind of presentation that would have given a better understanding of both Islam and of the Bedouins. As it were, it felt like you would have had to have a basic understanding of the religion and of the culture in Dubai. If I had known that, I would've done my research and came prepared. But because it was Q and A, there were a lot of awkward silences to begin with. I ended up asking questions just to get the conversation started. After the Q and A we went to the mosque and again it was just Q and A in the mosque. The whole thing lasts an hour and a half. I didn't do the brunch,but a lot of the group did. This is still a good experience, but I think it could be organized better so that people will come out with a better basic understanding of the religion. As it is now, I only feel slightly better about my knowledge."

The tour itself was short but interesting and informative. There was a visit to a mosque though the gentleman gave more of a lecture on tolerance and openness instead of something more informational. The lunch was pretty good - and the discussion during and after quite good as well. The main dilemma with the discussion is that it is led by younger hosts - university/high school students. On one end you get a very refreshing and open discussion, on the other the level of knowledge is a little naive. There was a very lacking and misleading answer on the differences between Shunni and Shia (this is not an easy question, and the answer kind of devolved into a political polemic).However, the discussion is meant to be on understanding Emirati culture better and the experience definitely serves this purpose. Come with an open mind, and leave having learned more about a culture that many Westerners know little about."

Their policy is \"open doors, open minds\" so all questions were on the table, even personal questions about marriage, clothes, religion.

With a guided cultural and history walk through the Al Fahidi district (older district of Dubai), this is a great place to set the facts straight about the philosophical ways of the Emirates. You can soak in information from the knowledgeable and easy to understand English speaking guide, as well as the beautiful old constructs which have been restored to original perfection. After the wonderful tour, you can opt to have a cultural lunch back within the cool confines of the Centre. If you go with this option you'll find that you have an hour to walk around the district again and look at what the little boutique market stalls have to offer.The cultural lunch is again a good start to look into the traditional foods that are offered within the UAE. The portions are massive and everyone is guaranteed to be able to take some home with them, whereby the Centre kindly provides take-away boxes to do so. You enjoy your meal while further listening to cultural information about the UAE (some of which is understandably repeated from the historical tour).Overall this was a great way to learn about the UAE and the Emirate people and was well worth the money. The food was delicious and was great fun to be able to eat in a traditional manner."

The cultural breakfast is really good for those people, visiting or living in the UAE, who just want to do something a bit different. My mother has done this on two consecutive visits! The food is nice, the atmosphere is lovely, it's friendly, not too impersonal and you can learn a thing or two. Yes, the answers to the questions during the open forum are answered in a very \"well versed\" manor, as is to be expected here. But there is a lot to learn and the hostesses are excellent. Take your kids, your parents and send your friends. It's a great value morning. Please please PLEASE remember where you are and what you are going to do..... Whilst the hosts show a blind eye to inappropriate dress, it's cringeworthy to see people in bare shoulders and short skirts/shorts. You will be sat on cushions, so think about what you're wearing!!!"

She was very entertaining, and we learned a tremendous amount even filtering out the slant. Given the difficulty short-time visitors have to interact with Emirati, this was extremely valuable. (Tip: For more local interaction, check out the Saturday bazaar at Wafi Mall, where mostly Emirati women sell their confections in 50+ booths.

In a very casual way the country's traditions and values are explained, free of ideology or opinionated statements. Anyone I have met at the center in the past was very welcoming, friendly and open for any kinds of questions. Any prejudice or stereo type one may have had about the Arabic culture might be cleared up after your visit. Worth the trip!An intercultural experience anyone moving to Dubai should definitely take the time for.Tip: Combine a visit at the center with a discovery tour through the Dubai Souqs, which are just on the other site of the Deira Creek (Abras are available for AED 1 / USD 0.27 to take you over the creek)."

I saw someone said the session was from American in other review, but that person probably misunderstood from her American accent. It was not one way presentation but true interactive session, so the area of topics may vary depending on other people in the room. Our time, there was a very proactive American couple who live in Dubai and, it seems, they struggle to understand the culture they are in and asked many questions. The Emirati presenter was really good to manage those variety of attendees and ensured all had opportunities to ask their questions. E.g. why Emirati ladies covers their body and face, why polygamy is allowed, what Emirati wedding is like etc. It was also very interesting that questions asked by various attendees from many countries actually reflected their \"stereotype\" of Emirati and its culture. I too was one of them certainly, but I personally found more similarity between my oriental culture and Emirati culture through the session. This is much better choice than just go top of the tall building or huge shopping mall where you can have similar experience somewhere else."

When we arrived at the center, we were told that when the weather is too hot, the breakfast and tour did not take place. We were further told we had contacted with the cancellation. When I checked my mail, the email was sent at 8:00 am, a time after we had already left our hotel to make the appointment. We were left very disappointed. Surely, if the summer months are too hot, then this is a known fact, and we could have been told this prior to the day of our tour! On a separate note, we tried to get information from the office staff, about what to do in the area, now that we were there without a plan. Let me say, I don't think it was the friendliest interaction I have ever had.With that said, I would certainly want to try this again - in the cooler months- as we feel we missed out on a wonderful cultural experience."

However, as we went in June when the temperature was around 40 degrees+, we spent most of the time in the Diwan Mosque and SMCCU house with our guide telling us more about the Emirati and Muslim culture. Although the references / comparisons to the Christian faith were largely incorrect, it was still very interesting to understand more about the Muslim religion and to see what Dubai looked like before the skyscrapers! I should add that some Muslims may be offended by how liberal the guide can be when interpreting parts of the Qur'an. The other disclaimer is the guide will be English speaking, so I wouldn't recommend this tour if you find English difficult to understand.Dress code is casual and the guide will provide appropriate clothing for the mosque if necessary.

Accept it for what it is.The young arab lady who showed us round was very friendly, though at certain stops when ppl started to ask questions, they were asked politely to save them for when we go inside for refreshments where she would answer them then. I felt by the time that part came people had lost the thread & some questions asked earlier, didn't come up again during this seated 'questions & answers' session. I also felt it was entirely inappropriate when an American women started asking questions about 'historical wars' and expected this young lady to furnish us all with political views. Of course she did the right thing & led the session back to what ..it should be about.. quite gracefully I thought! Go with the mindset of learning about the local culture & leave the political landscape at home, and you'll enjoy a pleasant morning.Tie the visit in with a boat trip over the waters to the gold souk or enjoy a wander around the busy Dubai Creek and make it a full day out.An added bonus for me after the cultural tour ended, was when we stumbled across a delightful restaurant inside the cultural area. This isn't signposted (or it wasn't), and after meandering around the narrow streets, we came across it unexpectedly, so watch out for this picturesqe & lovely little establishment. I don't even know its name! "

Many time visiting a foreign country you do not get the privilege of meeting the \"locals\" and to see and experience their true culture. Here you can. After visiting the centre you can stroll through the Bastakia area which is the original settlement of the traders of Dubai."

The guide was incredibly friendly and informative and was open to any and all questions. We learned so much about the culture and Islam. I had e-mailed the Centre in advance of booking anything to ask a few questions and they were extremely helpful and responsive. The guide also gave us very good directions on how to explore the gold and spice souks after our Heritage Tour. A must do while you are in Dubai."

We did both the Heritage Walk and the Cultural lunch, both facilitated by Nasif - a very worldly Emirati whose English is near perfect, sense of humour excellent, and ability to put his audience at ease about asking what may be awkward questions about Islam. The walk is a slow paced amble taking in a number of close by sights and all are explained in Nasif's interesting style and his philosophical chat inside the beautiful mosque was worth the modest cost by itself - very simple, logical, well structured but highlighting how irrational the World has become. Lunch was again very light hearted (with some of the same jokes for the mostly different audience) and all are included in the discussion, including the little ones in the audience. Food was lightly spiced and very tasty - again, well worth the cost and time taken. Walk was 90+minutes and the lunch about the same or a little more."

The food was tasty, and gave us a feel for what traditional meals are like. Very interesting and I encourage everyone going to Dubai to pay them a visit. By train get off at Al fahidi station, otherwise you can take an Abbra from the gold souk over to the other side. If taking the train, the website gives walking instructions. About a 10min walk."

They also have traders in the historic village ( which is actually a restored traditional village, not a replica) so you can pick up a few souvenirs while you are there. The traditional lunch was tasty and they even offered take away containers if people wanted to take leftovers home (so great option if you are on a tight budget, two meals for the price of one!).

The trip to the local mosque also gives an opportunity for questions.The real joy though it the cultural lunch, where pupils have the chance to try some beautiful Emirati food and ask questions of local people, a chance which isn't readily available to tourists passing through. In the past years, we have had a selection of different hosts, from local students to the main chap (whose name I've forgotten) who is very entertaining).One piece of advice. In past years, we have booked a private session and lunch in the centre, which has been a fantastic opportunity to ask questions and enjoy the food This time, we attended the open lunch (this was our fault: the booking we had made wasn't for lunch, and the centre were super-helpful and flexible with a few hours notice to fit us in) which lacked the intimacy and openness of the private ones so I'd recommend a private talk, especially for groups.Nonetheless, a really worthwhile experience which I think everyone who goes to Dubai should have!"

You get to ask questions about a society transforming quickly from isolated fishing villages to being one of the richest and most developed countries in the world. Instead of being open discussion about everything that you can't ask elsewhere, the conversation mostly centered around dress: a fairly simple topic. Development, tradition and identity were barely even mentioned, despite asking questions. Thus, I felt the discussion was a bit simple. What more, the host often denied a lot of the accusations usual made towards the headscarf, despite them not being raised directly. These defensive responses got weary after a while. I'm sure some of the other visitors got a lot out of it, but I didn't come away with anything I hadn't already read in the guidebook.

The informative and fun-laden presentations while enjoying a traditional lunch provide great insights into the ways of life and thought of pre \"World Hub\" Dubai. Do keep in mind that the lunches are nearly always full, with limited capacity, so early booking is highly recommended. The entire neighborhood is about all that is left of \"old\" Dubai, with its adobe architecture, so well worth spending some time in."

One has a sense that justification for the treatment of women in Emerati society is 'it has always been that way, so if it ain't broke don't fix it'. Thoughtful analysis quickly cuts holes in such thinking, but the notion that just because we are different does not mean such difference is inherently bad is a simple and compelling notion. We applaud the initiation of this program to help cut through annoying cross-cultural stereotypes, even if aspects of the guides commentary were a tad patronising in a well meaning way. We found the tour, commentary and ambience to be a helpful, at times amusing, but overall fascinating glimpse into aspects of Emerati culture. The 'open minds' mantra that surrounds this tour is a good enough basis to make the investment to go on the tour. Well worth it!"

I think the taxi drivers don`t know where is SMCCU but if you say to them that you want to go in Bastaqia (museum quarter) they all know where to go. There ask where is SMCCU is not obvious as it is in one of the houses in the neighborhood, but you will find it. Try to get there with 30 minutes in advance. At SMCCU you can buy diferent packages (they all include a 30-60 minutes talk with a guide about the religion and traditions in dubai). I have buyed the Herritage Tour which is a walk by old quarter (Bastaqia) + mosque and a tea talk which lasts 90 minutes and costs 55 AED/person. You can find lot on informations on their website that you can find in the informations menu on tripadvisor.com (http://www.cultures.ae). Try to book in advance! Attention to the dress code, especially if you visit the mosque, hands and feet covered mostly women and head scarf. After the tours you can visit the quarter as long as you desire.Believe me, you have many misconceptions about Islam in general, so it would be good to do this tour, which besides will give you more information about the history of Dubai, will offer you lot of informations about their religion and traditions. Here you will find nice people who will not feel offended by any questions asked, so take advantage of this unique opportunity."

There is a Q&A session before and after breakfast which is VERY informative and very entertaining. The time flew by and we could have stayed longer. Breakfast was good and they also provided containers so you could take the leftovers home!! The fee was 60AED per person and you really got value for this. Well worth it!To reach there, go to Al Fahidi Metro Station (Green line) and it's a short walk from there. Complete directions are on their website: http://www.cultures.ae/index.php/contactOverall, I would HIGHLY recommend this. It is great for tourists but also for those of us that live here in Dubai. I also think that you can go to either the breakfast or the lunch several times and it will always be informative as it will depend on who the host is and what questions that audience asks.

We received a very warm welcome by two local woman and a man. While the women explained their culture and answered questions (you can ask them anything), we were served coffee, followed by the meal and some tea. All dishes are Vegetarian-friendly and they tend to be sweet.The breakfast lasted two hours, but it depends on how much the visitors interact and ask questions. We were shown how women wear the traditional costume. You will learn so many interesting facts about food, clothes, marriage and living in Dubai.The only bit which I think should be changed is that the water is handed out in small containers - not very environmental-friendly.If you decide to visit, please be respectful and cover your cleavage, arms and legs.

If you want a real Emirati breakfast instead of a hotel breakfast, the SMCCU breakfast program is an absolute must. You'll be served authentic breakfast in a traditional setting, and it's positively delicious and exceptionally affordable. Food is served buffet-style, and boxing some up to take with you is encouraged by the host. For that reason alone, you should make sure this is part of your Dubai trip.Incredible breakfast aside, the other portion of the event that is perhaps equally exciting is that the breakfast is hosted by an Emirati who works with the SMCCU on their \"Open Doors, Open Minds\" project. He invites in a small group of Emiratis (when I visited, it was students from a tech school) who sit amongst the guests and join in a discussion about culture and tradition while breakfast is eaten. My only gripe, which is not preventing me from giving a five-star review, is that I had hoped the talk would highlight the differences between Emiratis and natives of neighboring countries. Instead, most of the discussion was taken up by tourists who wanted to know more about religious customs. My hoped-for Emirati 101 class wound up being an Islam 101 class (and I already knew the course material). The bottom line is that the breakfast is great, you'll have the opportunity to ask any questions you like about Emirati or Islamic culture, and for some of the Emiratis who are brought in to the program, you'll be the first Western person they've ever talked to or broken bread with. It's a wonderful experience and I was very pleased to have taken part in it."

If you plan to do ONE thing different during your time in Dubai, this is the right place for you. Centre for Cultural Understanding is government funded organisation, a kind of tourism organisation that promotes Emirati culture and traditions to visitors. They have different kinds of activities: you can choose among a traditional breakfast or lunch, a guided walking tour around Bastakiya (only area of Dubai more that 100 years old) or a guided visit to Jumeirah mosque, to name a few. On all tours/events/visits/lunch/breakfasts, they have professional and informative Emirati (English-speaking) guides who patiently explain and show traditional side of Emirati culture that you will not have a chance to see anywhere else unless an Emirati invites you to their home. And all is very reasonably priced: from a 3 euros (5 US dollars) guided visit to mosque and 7 euros (10 US$) 60 min guided walk around Bastakiya to 12 euros (18 US$) cultural breakfast (traditional food and 60 min chat)- they are all steals! In short - DO go on one of these tours (breakfast is my favourite, however they are all nice -I tried them all as I always take my visitors there), you will have fun and learn more about Dubai culture in an hour that you will in rest of your stay in Dubai!PS.

Tasting the variety of foods offered was great in and of itself, but the two women hosting the lunch really made the experience wonderful. They were very well-spoken, interacted with the attendees, and gave some good insights into aspects of culture and hospitality that I wouldn't have learned otherwise. Well worth the experience, and I hope to try a breakfast and/or tour program on future visits. Great way to learn about Emirati culture."

It was fabulous, funny and enlightening! The explanation of black abayas being a cultural dress and how many other countries have different colours, different burgaa, different scarfs and how they wear them. Much like any country really, when you think of fashion- there are many types. We had a lovely Emirati lady join us and we discussed as a group family values, women's roles which was well put by our host- women are to be elevated. I think the biggest thing my friends got out of the experience is that Islam is a peaceful way of life and in no way is it a representation of the radical on fundamentalism we hear, see and read about in the news. Too bad the news doesn't report on this very peaceful way of life. The food was magnificent!! We all enjoyed it so much so, I am returning with my next set of guests from the UK. Thank you!"

My friend and I went to the Sheik Mohammad Centre for Cultural Understanding while we were in Dubai in September 2012 after I read about it on the Trip Advisor site. Open doors, Open minds \u2013 nothing could be truer. We had lunch at the centre and the spread provided was delicious [and at AED 70, the best value meal that one could ever find in Dubai without a doubt]. In addition to the great food, I really enjoyed myself as it was not only educational but entertaining as well. To get the best from this activity one must leave preconceptions at the front door and remember that it is the centre who have \u2018opened their doors\u2019 and it is us as their guests who should \u2018open our minds\u2019. Our host addressed many of the negative perceptions of their culture subtly, with humour and without a hint of criticism of any other group, race or religion. As he spoke, I shuddered inwardly as I remembered a time when I had preconceptions that anyone who didn\u2019t live life in the same manner that I did was the one who had a problem. If one chooses to listen and reflect on the basics, he and his family have the same types of issues and positives that we have. I must comment - one issue for some is that the men wear white and the women wear black. Hey, get with the program, black is my colour of choice !!!!!! . I have a wardrobe that rates ten to one in favour of black. My suitcase was full of it.I hope that visitors to Dubai will visit the centre with an open mind. It is through such open forums that we as human beings can begin to understand and appreciate each other as people with differences as well as many things that are the same. No-one is asking anyone to change, simply to understand. Even if the meal had not been included, I would have paid the money for the entertainment, laughs and the education value and still considered that I had excellent value. I thank SMCCU for their hospitality and grace and hope that future visitors will enjoy it as much as I did. The world would be a better place if there were more interaction between cultures of the type that occurs here."

I came with an open mind & not really aware of many of the issues of the UAE. I left deeply disturbed. Our Emirati host encouraged us to throw the hard topics at him - treatment of women, why women wear black which is hotter while men wear white & public beatings for offences such adultery. The 'open' discussion on hard topics were addressed in a comedic manner - which made it feel like it should come with a '2 drink minimum'. We were given the opportunity to try on the abaya & encouraged to feel how lightweight it was. When the American tourist commented that she couldn't breathe when she put the mask over her face our host told her she would 'get used to it'. You just said a lot in that sentence, sir. Appraise yourself of the details on treatment of women (including tourists) and you may not want to sit down to eat. When they rolled out an American now living in the UAE at the end to sell us on the burka being her preference - it all felt so contrived."

You are welcomed into the mosque (you should wear suitable clothing -covering legs, arms and definitely chests, but traditional attire is provided if you can't refrain from wearing shorts to the mosque. Women are asked to cover their hair. You need to remove your shoes but aren't required to go through the ablution process. The talk was given by a British woman who converted to Islam 20 years ago. She gives a basic summary of Islam and talks of some Muslim traditions and religious practices. She prays, talks you through the process of Muslim prayer and discusses Muslim attire. At the end she answers any questions at all. Throughout the whole talk she is extremely open and all questions are answered and photos and videos can be taken at any point.

They're good with the standard fare about why Arab women dress the way they do, etc. But cultural understanding is not furthered by dismissing key differences among world religions or traditions held by non-Emirati cultures, or lambasting the average Westerner for arriving at honest misconceptions while trying to digest media reports from the other side of the planet.

It\u2019s not necessary to pre-pay it, very convenient. The SMCCU is located at a cultural area - Baskitaya, nearby there\u2019re some little shops for selling arts, craftsmen, paintings, etc. After/ before the cultural lunch, you could walk around the nearby area for exploring the heritage of Dubai. Oh! Also the Dubai museum and Heritage house are nearby too! As you can see from many comments below, through the lunch, you could get to know better of the background of Arabian culture. I admire this idea for cultural exchange. \u2018Dining\u2019 plays an important role in daily life. Through dining to understand a culture is faster and easier than reading books. It\u2019s definitely an open book activity, I believe many foreigners are curious enough to know the mysterious Arabian culture. This is a right place to know it better with no shy! It worths the visit, it only costs 70AED per person but make you a valuable and meaningful afternoon."

In order to be part of the Heritage tour, we had to book a few days in advance. We started our tour with a stop in a mosque, where our excellent guide Waleed told us about their religion, praying, mosque history and whatever we would like to know. After here, we walked for an hour to see replica houses from ancient times, learning about how they lived their lives in the old days. The very good history telling from our guide made this very interesting also for our children.We ended with a Q&A session, where we were offered arabic coffee and dates. The setting was laidback, and our guide allowed us to ask about anything we wanted! We learned about their tradition way of dressing, differencies in sex roles and rules for dating/marrying :-) When the questions about Dubai's investment rate and need to borrow money from Abu Dhabi during the financial crises and about democracy in UAE, the answers sounded more \"official\". But we enjoyed the opportunity to ask about anything, and the fact that the SMCCU give us their best answers from a local point of view.Our tour was supposed to last from 10.30-12.00, but it ended around 1.00 pm thanks to our fantastic guide and nice group of people!We recommend visitors to have lunch at the nice Basta Art Cafe after this tour."

I thought, \"If this is the best Dubai can do, I'm in trouble.\" So I booked a heritage tour for my first morning in Dubai, figuring that it would at least be an easy transition into my vacation.The heritage tour was wonderful. Our group and two guides spent about an hour and a half wandering around the Bastakiya district looking at replica houses, touring a mosque, and hearing about the history of Dubai. As a Westerner with little to no experience in Islamic history or Middle Eastern cultures, it was an eye-opening experience. The guides were candid about their way of life and did not bat an eye when touchy questions were raised. They handled our curiosities with grace and humor, while giving an insight into Emirati life, something you'll likely miss if you just come for the modern attractions.Following the tour, our guides sat down with our group for coffee and dates and another Q&A session. Again, their answers were relevant and easily accessible to all audiences. The information and insight they provided helped to broaden our minds at the beginning of our vacation, which I believe enhanced our Dubai experience.If you do one thing in Dubai, take a tour with the SMCCU."

Unfortunately when we were there they had a bunch of American students staying for lunch so we couldn't stay as long as we would have liked as the conversation was just getting really interesting, so we would definitely go back if we ever visit Dubai again.

You must pre-book however; I noticed that the few negative comments on this site are from people who just showed up at the site and didn't really participate in any program. Just walking around this area would be boring. We booked the Bastikaya Mosque & Walking tour which lasted about 90 minutes. During the Mosque visit, women must have shoulders, knees, and hair covered. If they are not, they will loan you a headscarf or even an abaya if you want. It's only a short presentation; it's mostly Q&A. You can ask ANY question, they've heard it all before. I found some of our group's questions painfully ignorant and even perhaps racist but the 2 guides remained good-natured and informative nonetheless. The center is also right by the waterfront where you can see traditional boats. Put aside any ignorance about all Arab countries being the same; they may share a language and a basic faith but are about as alike as Christian Democracies are--America, Mexico, Kenya for example. Learn about the UAE for yourself. One tip is to book the morning tour followed by lunch for the full experience. This is truly the best thing you can do in Dubai! Almost everything else is glitz, shopping, sand or beach related."

For example - one tour guide told us how his mom is trying to find a wife for him, but so far he didn't really like any of them, another told us about his engagement and about his uncle who has two wifes. That's the stuff I personally find the most interesting: the everyday life of local people. So if you decided to go - don't be afraid to ask questions and pick their minds. As a tourist in any foreign country you don't get opportunities like this a lot, especially in Muslim countries, where privacy is very, very important."

Nasif & Dhalia, 2 of the volunteers at the center are great hosts, great entertainers and genuinely open to listen and talk to you. This is another Dubai...

The afternoon begins with a lunch served buffet style featuring probably the only authentic Emirati food that is easily available for tourists in a city mainly designed to replicate something else. The food was excellent and a good value. The remaining 45 minutes consisted of a male and female discussing common misunderstandings about being Emirati. The positive was that the man, in particular, was so passionate about relations between Arabs and non-Arabs that it was hard not to leave with an overwhelming sense that any conflict was borne out of miscommuncations. On the other hand, his passion also led him to launch into a seeming diatribe at times and made it more difficult to truly discuss more controversial topics. The one and a half to two hours were a little hard on my back sitting in Emirati style on the ground without back support although I could have chosen to sit on one of the few benches. I was also surprised that a third of the attendees lived in Dubai."

            "review": "Excellent Experience, Would Highly Recommend. We attended the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding breakfast. I really wasn't sure what to expect because there weren't a lot of tripadvisor reviews or information online. It exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend the breakfast, or anything else put on by the SMCCU.We arrived for the 10am breakfast, unsure what we were getting ourselves into. We were greeted, asked to remove our shoes, then taken into what would have been the courtyard/living room of an old Dubai home that's been converted into a cultural center.There were probably 25-30 guests at our particular breakfast. Two volunteers (one man in his early 50s and another young lady in her early 20s) led an informal discussion of culture, religion and politics and encourages guests to ask any questions that will help them gain a better understanding. Being from a primarily Christian, homogenous area of the US, it was so interesting to me to hear these volunteers speak so openly about Muslim stereotypes with the hopes of spreading a mutual understanding and respect. So if you are looking for something out of the ordinary and appreciate the opportunity to experience cultures different from your own, I would highly encourage you visiting the SMCCU."

            "review": "Things you always wanted to ask about the emirati culture and religion. When I travel to a country, I try to get to know the local culture and typical food. In a country like UAE where 90% of the population is constituted by foreigners, that's a bit of a challenge. In the Sheik Mohamed Centre we have the opportunity to know more about the typical emirati food. You can schedule to have breakfasts and lunches with typical food and during ramadam they have iftar dinners (big dinners to break fasting). The prices and schedule are on the web site.While we are eating and drinking, they explain lots of things about customs, the reason for those traditions and about the religion. For me it was very interesting to talk about my doubts without the fear of offending anyone, and they explain things in a very rational way, always trying to make it easier for foreigners to understand their culture.Information about the culture, history, the way they dress, women condition, Muslim religion, food ... its a very friendly environment to talk about everything and learn a lot.I really recommend this experience for travelers from all ages, because I believe that if we have more information , we can be less affected by prejudice and news broadcast (ti's always bad news that arrive to us from other countries).Just plan ahead because they only have the meal meetings in a couple of days a week. Breakfasts are hosted every Monday and Wednesday at 10.00am, and lunches are hosted every Sunday and Tuesday at 1.00pm, and advance booking is required.The centre also has other atractions like tours in Batakya area and the visit of the Mosque. I hope to be able to try those other activities next time I'm in Dubai."

            "review": "Took in Three Tours - Well Worth It. Was in Dubai in January on a business trip and had limited time for sight-seeing. Discovered the tours and cultural exchanges offer by the Sheik Mohammed Center for Cultural Understanding and am very pleased that I spent what time I had for touring with them. Booked three events on a Sunday (not all tours are offered on each day, so do your homework) -- Mosque Visit, Tour of the Bastakiya Quarter, and the Luncheon/Discussion. Started with the Mosque tour on Sunday morning. Was joined by about 75 others on the program, which featured a full explanation of Islamic prayer practices and the features of the Mosque. The program coordinators then answered any questions posed from the audience. It was very informal and quite illuminating -- very interesting. I then caught a cab to the Center's office, located in the Basakiay Quarter, where both the tour and luncheon are held. The tour was led by two young residents of Dubai, dressed in traditional clothing - The tour takes you through the last remaining remnants of old Dubai, providing information on the city's history and traditional architecture. Then, it was on to the Center's headquarters for the luncheon, featuring traditional UAE fare and held in the building's courtyard. Here, we heard from one of the directors of the Center, who wore traditoinal clothing and discussed both men and women's clothing and roles in society. Many of the topics covered at the Mosque were discussed here, however, it was still all very interesting. The food was quite good and the discussion very helpful to a visitor from the US. The staff here is very helpful and will provide information on other things to do in \"Dubai. I was able to leave the Center and take a 10 minute walk to the abra pier where I took a very inexpensive ride to other side of the creek, where I visited the Gold and Spice Souks. The SMCCU is a good value and will help you understand life and society in the UAE. I recommend taking part in their tours and activities. Very reasonably priced and informative."

            "review": "A MUST do!. I've lived in Dubai for 3 years now and the iftar dinner last night at SMCCU was one of the best things I've done here! Our hosts at the centre, all locals, were so friendly and hospitable! They sat with us for dinner and were more than happy to talk about their customs, religion, lifestyle, cuisine, fashion... They encouraged us to ask inconvenient questions and there was no taboo subject! All of them had a fabulous sense of humour, but some of them are so funny that they should be moonlighting as standup comedians :) After dinner we were taken to the mosque nearby (my first time in a mosque!), on a quick tour around the Bastakiya and we came back to the villa for deserts, tea, coffee, more conversations, better cultural understanding and heaps of laughter.An amazing experience that I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dubai! Last night we learnt more about the place we live in than in all the years we've spent here..."

I've lived in Dubai six years and found my breakfast experience at the Cultural center was extremely informative and definitely worth attending. The host was very gracious and forthcoming in his information concerning the UAE culture and traditions. He geared it to his audience (who were mainly Americans and all women) and made us feel welcomed and did not prejudge our conceptions of his country. His friendliness, humor and the casual environment made us feel 'at home' and relaxed. I would recommend this adventure for all, whether long time residents, tourists or newcomers. Families too!"

This centre is probably the only place in Dubai that a tourist can see what 'real' Emirati culture is about, rather than just the malls, beach, bars & restaurants. It's also probably the only place you can interact with Emiraitis and ask all the questions you're desperate to know the answers to. They have cultural lunches and breakfasts, guided walking tours of the Bastakiya area, guided visits to Jumeirah Mosque and Question & Answer sessions, all mainly hosted by Emiratis. All the activities need to be booked in advance but a quick phone call or email sorts that out ([--]or [--]). We loved our visit to the centre and would encourage everyone to go and sample the real Dubai!"

            "review": "Great experience. The Shaikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding in the historic Bastakiya Quarter of Dubai offers walking tours of the area, cultural breakfasts and lunches, and question-and-answer sessions. These are open to anyone, and offer insights into Arabic food and customs. Booking is required.On a return visit to Dubai in late December, I took my extended family (aged 11 to 78) to SMCCU for the walking tour and cultural lunch. A volunteer guide, Waleed, took us for the stroll around the historic buildings, then our lunch was hosted by a delightful Emirati woman, Salama. There were about 15 in the group for lunch.Our hostess served tea and dates and spoke about Emirati hospitality customs, then explained the traditional diets of Emiratis and the array of luncheon dishes before us. After lunch, our hostess opened up the question-and-answer session, telling us to feel free in our questions. She spoke quite openly about all sorts of topics raised by the luncheon guests and gave us a wonderful insight into many aspects of Emirati life and traditions. All members of my family enjoyed this excursion and the older members thought it was a higlight of our Dubai trip. I highly recommend this as something different to do in Dubai."
