It is the largest stupa in all of Asia. The shops around the stupa were full of lovely things and nice shopkeepers. The Tibetan culture is alive and well here. It was one of the highlights of Kathmandu for us."

It is worthwhile though just stopping to people watch as they circle the structure clockwise turning the many prayer wheels. There are many different castes/ nationalities here in all different types of dress, our official guide explaining where they all came from.- fascinating. There are many shops around the stupa but a must is to go into the temple opposite the main entrance where there is a balcony from which you can literally watch the world go by."

These peoples are cross Himalaya by foot, moreover bowing five times for one foot. It means when they do one step ahead, they bow five times and that bow is not just a bow, they have to forehead, palms, knees and toes touch the ground.Even you don\u2019t understand anything about Buddhism or doesn\u2019t know anything about recent Tibetan history, you might feel something when you visit here."

I had the good fortune to stay at the Hyatt Regency hotel, a mere 10-minute walk to Boudhanath, during a week-long stay in Kathmandu. I walked over to Boudhanath every evening and never got tired of it. The 2015 earthquake destroyed the spire of the stupa, which is currently being rebuilt. Accordingly, all access to the various levels of the stupa's mandala are closed. You can only walk around the perimeter and enter the small temple on the north side of the stupa.Nevertheless, this is in my opinion a sight you can't miss while in Kathmandu. It's the holiest Tibetan Buddhist shrine outside of Tibet. The perimeter of the square is filled with shops and monasteries. Pilgrims make circuits around the base of the stupa. I found it very tranquil and relaxing to walk with them as they chanted and some even prostrated themselves.I had dinners at the Roadhouse Cafe rooftop, which looks out at the south side of the stupa, as the sun set each evening. On my final morning in town I woke up early and walked over to Boudhanath at 6:30 a.m. The square was already buzzing with pilgrims circumambulating the stupa. I also had the treat of seeing and hearing novice monks engaged in their morning chants at one of the monasteries on the square.If you're in town, make sure to visit. Even without the ability to walk up to the top of the stupa this is still one of the special and unique holy places on earth to see."

Amazing expirience, but you have to walk on the higher circle. It is indeed some kind of meditation and after trekking it feels like proper thing to do to say goodbye to Nepal. In 2015 with stupa gone we felt so devastating there, could only last for 5 to 10 minutes. It felt as if this place is a heart of Nepal and it was broken that year. But when Stupa will be restored is highly recommended, probably the best place in Kathmandu, but unfortunately overcrowded."

Gorgeous Buddhist shrine, make sure you walk around and hit all the prayer wheels. Beautiful view of Kathmandu from up high."

It is worth visit with excellent sculptures, colors, and art. View is breathtaking as you enter. As well as you get good foods nearby. Sit here peacefully and try to feel its aroma. You dont have to walk much around. Place is small but has everything you need to know about art. You must come to \"chabel\" the main crossroads. But just ask microvans for \"bouddha\" and get off 10 meters from the stupa. 3 hours is enough i guess"

Putting that detail aside, the Stupa was only worth about an hour's visit since it was the singe thing to see there. Other sites tend to be part of much larger attraction allowing more time to explore. The only other aspect was the many souvenir stores surrounding the structure in a large circle. It made the experience a little disappointing as it seemed more of a tourist shopping area than a religious shrine. Still worth seeing, especially when repaired, but try to find other sites to see nearby to make the trip worthwhile."

About 15% of the population are Buddhists.Look out for Tibetan monks, with shaven heads and maroon robes, and pilgrims spinning prayer wheels and buying yak butter and tsampa (roasted barley flour). Be careful to observe Tibetan custom by walking around the stupa in a clockwise direction.There has been a stupa on this site since Tibetan king Songsten Gampo converted to Buddhism in around 600 AD.when?

There's an entrance fee if / when entering from the main gate, but because we had some local friends who brought us there they brought us through a back-gate instead. It was definitely a big difference from the hustle bustle of dust-filled streets outside! The stupa grounds aren't very big, but is filled with quaint little shops and eateries/cafes. The architecture if also vastly differently. I would have loved spending more time here, so I suggest taking 2-3 hours to fully take it all in."

Among the main monuments of Kathmandu this is the one I appreciated most, probably due to the particular setting, as you enter this closed multilateral compound with the circular stupa in the center (seen from above it is to resemble a mandala), and you walk around it (clockwise, remember) as if turning a prayer wheel, together with the faithful and visitors. Shops and cafeterias, restaurants and guesthouses dot the buildings surrounding the square. Do not forget to turn the big (and heavy) prayer wheel in the temple inside the square. It is a good place to buy tangkas and mandalas, as shops are generally one and the same with the artisans laboratories. The whole place has a marked Tibetan character, as the stupa is built right on the ancient trade route coming down from the Tibetan border. I visited during the Buddha\u2019s birthday festival, and the place was joyously crowded with faithful. It was a pity that the 2015 earthquake has stricken hard the top of the stupa, so that the pinnacle and square drum (with the Buddha eyes) were under restoration and not visible. It was the place in Kathmandu, among the ones I saw, most alive with religious activity."

With all due respect to Nepal for their suffering from the earthquake in 2015, the fact is this temple is in construction and inaccessible as at May 2016 and hence you wont see much except the buildings outside the stupa (souvenir shops, some prayer bells and donation boxes). Having said that, ticket fee is still applicable which is a bit strange to me. You are welcomed to donate but dont expect a fieste to the eyesIf you want to go anyway, its 1.5km eastward from the Pashupatinath. Avoid ticket: The main entrance has a big wood gateway you must walk through. The ticket office is right inside. However, just 50 M to the east (after the Yak restaurant) there are two smaller alleys lined by shops, leading into the temple plaza. Just walk in those alleys instead.Have heard that its nice in late afternoon or evening of a full moon when the temple is lit up"

I like to go in the late afternoon, so I can join the people, the nuns and monks in their daily round of prayer and contemplation. The Stupa was badly damaged by the 24th April 2015 Earthquake. Unlike some of the other World Heritage sites in Kathmandu, where little reconstruction has commenced, the Tibetan community and Tibetan Monasteries around Boudha, have not waited for the usual Government inactivity and apathy and have taken control of the situation and started extensive repairs. It was heartbreaking to see the damage, but very heartening to see real progress being made to get this important Buddhist shrine back to a state befitting its international status. I was also very impressed that the Committee/community have not taken advantage of the Earthquake by increasing prices for tourists, so this site had more visitors than some of the other World Heritage sites. This makes Boudha a good value visit (Rs 250) unlike Durbar Sq or Pahsupatinath where tourists are charged Rs1000. The area around Boudha is well served with roof top restaurants, so I love to go and sit on one of these terraces and have dinner and see the Stupa lit up in the early evening, by hundreds of butter lamps. Until the repairs are completed, we are a little way off seeing this beautiful sight, but Boudhanath is getting there and upgrading all the facilities at the same time."

The 2015 earthquakes left the main Stupa and several of the smaller ones in a terrible state and some efforts to rebuilding were begun in late 2015 and early 2016. The Buddhist faithful still come in throngs and the square is still quite crowded - especially on auspicious days. I'd have to say that it's still worth the time and effort to go.Getting there is not all that hard, depending on where you're coming from. And, of you're like most visitors you're likely staying in and or around Thamel. You can certainly walk - I have on manny occasions and you can meander though streets until you make your way there - something I highly recommend - do bring a camera. Easiest thing, of you're not up to the walk is to take a taxi. Now, recent events have forced the prices of taxis up, what with fuel shortages etc. That particular crisis is over, but I suspect that the price of taxis is still a little high. It used to cost about 500 Rs (about 5$). That's somewhat negotiable - as it always has been. With recent events it should cost you no more than 800 Rs - my advice - negotiate - start at 500 Rs - and them dicker. Once you get there it can be a bit of an experience getting in - there are several gates, most often people arrive at the main gate. There's a fee for entering; the money goes to restoration and maintenance of the site. Foreign visitors pay more - get used to that - you can afford it anyhow. The square is lined with shops selling all of the same, somewhat tired, tourist goods - caveat emptor - as always. There are numerous restaurants that line the square, most offer rooftop views. Take one or more in as a way to get a better view of the stupa. Take your time. Be observant. Be polite. Enjoy the experience."

Our tour group had a brief lunch there and then I and a young Irish couple went to visit the monastery. As was often the case when I visited such places, I was overwhelmed by the artwork. But this time, as I stared at the brightly colored statues, paintings, and prayer flags, I was approached by a young monk who offered me incense, encouraged me to pray, and then delivered me to the Lama for a blessing. And in a real sense, this experience summarized my whole trip to Nepal. I felt welcomed, appreciated, and blessed by all my encounters with people in this wonderful country. Is this really a review of the Boudhanath? Perhaps not. But some experiences cannot be well conveyed by pictures or written descriptions.

Just be sure you respect the locals and give them space to pray and worship. There are a few nooks and crannies you can actually walk inside, where you will find prayer wheels as big as a person. Sadly, a year after the earthquake, the stuppa itself has not been rebuilt and all that's left if the dome. Construction is underway but is going very slowly. Instead, make your way to the many monasteries surrounding the area. Take off your shoes and make a small donation as you walk in. Some monks speak English and are happy to answer any questions you have about Buddhism and the prayer space, which are covered in the most glorious tapestries I have ever seen. Pictures are allowed, but not during prayer time. Around the stuppa itself there are hundreds of little shops selling anything from prayer beads to mandala art. It almost contradicts the very nature of the Holy space, but it all seems to mesh together very well. Definitely worth a visit even though the stuppa is broken."

It's NOT a quiet garden. There are many people.The Stupa: Yes, it's under construction. That's fine. Go anyway. It's lucky the temple and surrounding buildings even exist given the seriousness of the earthquake. The Buddhist worshipers are not waiting for a complete reconstruction. The bricks are damaged; the spirit of this place is not.The fee: Don't pay the 1,000 ($10 USD) fee to get in. That's silly. There are couple of alleys to get in. Thousands of people are walking in without paying. This is a public square. By avoiding the fee, you are not depriving the common Nepalese of money. There are many shops, little cafe's, people selling hot tea in the morning, people selling everything. So, use your $10 USD inside and the common people will get the money instead of some inefficient gov't agency or the guard's pocket."

There are multiple local guides on hand who are very nice. Try and barter the price down a bit and they will likely take you to a shop near the end of the tour to show you some things but don't feel like you have to buy anything. Having said all that they were very informative and even the shop had cultural significance as it was a Thangka school. The owner gave me a tour and told me how the paintings were made and this was for no extra costs. They did ask if I wanted to buy any and I firmly but politely declined after which they did not push me further. Overall I learnt a lot about the area and had a lovely time. It is one of 3 main temples in Kathmandu so it is on the list of things to see. The shops in the area do seem a bit more pricey compared to other parts of the city so don't buy at first sight."

Look at the pictures of the place from before the earthquake and imagine it as it was years ago and appreciate it along with the surroundings when you get there. This country is in desperate need of funds from tourism after the earthquake. So, don't complain when they ask you for $10 vs the locals being free or paying $2, because if you're reading the reviews about the Stupa on Tripadvisor, then chances are you make roughly 5x or more than what the locals do.

The monks there are extremely friendly, if you show some sincere interest. If you are interested in the spiritual aspect of the place, make sure to be there early in the morning or around 5-6, when you can also join in the mass cora around the stupa. There are also a number of performers usually. Boudhanath is around 30min walking from Pashupatinath, along some small, not touristy, typical-daily-life kind of streets. The two make for a nice day trip. A practical note: around the entrance of Boudha, there are some women with children that will try to trick you to go and buy milk formula for the children. Admittedly, we did get partly tricked the first time around but then they led us into a shop and we realised the woman and person behind the counter are probably working together since the price they asked for the formula was extremely high. Save yourselves some time and don't buy into their talk, despite the fact that the children do look like they need more nutrition...."

The paintings inside and on the roof are more colorful than the paintings in Chinese temples I've seen in Beijing. The swirly designs and dragons are similar and familiar, but the colors and flowers and outlines are noticeably different, which is interesting. The stupa was unfortunately still under construction from damage from the earthquake. In the two months I've lived here, I have seen considerable strides in repair of the dome and top. If you're Buddhist (or not) it's nice to spin the prayer wheels around the stupa and in the monastery. The giant one in the monastery is very cool. The stores are reasonably priced for a tourist area. It'll be nice when the structure is fixed, since it's unfortunate that it's very dusty and dirty right now. Most of KTM is dirty all the time, but inside this \"bubble\" it was always clean, free of garbage."

In the morning there is lots of activity as the Tibetan locals go about their business before the tourists arrive - there is a local monastery and all the small child monks are often seen around the temple. As the sun goes down the Tibetans, in their national costumes, come out again to walk clockwise around the Stupa, turning prayer wheels as they go. Join them and get swept along in this very calming and traditional ritual. I love this place."

Something spoke to be from my most inner most depths of my soul. As I approached I heard the soft voices of all the pilgrims walking around the stupa in a clockwise direction - Om mani padme hum - they became louder and louder and i realized I was listening to all the low voices. I felt I was in a very holy place. I moved from Thamel to a guesthouse nearby here and this became my home base in Nepal - my home away from home in Nepal. But I felt at home here. It's a feeling that's hard to describe but when you come here you will feel it. I watched the Tibetans come pray here twice a day and joined in with them. I attended the pujas in the numerous Buddhist monasteries nearby and in the area. I fed the pigeons and the homeless stray dogs with the displaced Tibetans here. I gave donations to the poor. I befriended some of the young pretty women pretending to be milk mothers trying to scam money from the foreigners. I took the street orphans to lunches. I watched the pilgrims do prostrations over and over all the way around Boudhanath - even inthe pouring rain. I befriended my 1st Buddhist monks here too who took me \"under their wing\" and taught me about mind training, and their practices and rituals and single minded concentration and other things too. It is here that I learned that Buddhism is divided into 3 parts: Buddhist Philosophy, Buddhist Science and Buddhist Religion. I also learned about the healing power of sound. Come to Boudhanath and stay and lose yourself...and then find yourself."

The Stupa is surrounded by rooftop restaurants and shops, and it is really worth having lunch or a snack on one of the roofs to enjoy the view before/after walking around the Stupa and spinning the prayer wheels. Be aware that at the moment, you can only walk around the periphery of the Stupa, rather than on any of the levels. 250NRS entrance fee to the area for foreigners.

There is also a nearby monastery which you can visit that has a very big prayer wheel upstairs."

The main draw of this place is the shopping area around it. There is an entry fee for SAARC citizens (less) as well as non-SAARC citizens (more). The stupa's top part (structure above the white dome) has completely collapsed in the earthquake. As such, there is not much to see of the stupa, except the white dome and the prayer wheels around it.The whole stupa area is set up in the form of a circle - the stupa in the centre and shops, restaurants, small bldgs, alleyways around it. There are plenty of souvenur shops selling pashminas, yak wool items, paintings, art, handicraft items, knick-knacks, etc. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants (mainly on the first and second levels on the tiny bldgs) here and this is the main tourist draw of the stupa now. Also explore the alleways leading out of the stupa circle, for some Tibetan style traditional wear, kimonos, local items and tiny local restaurants. We visited this on a Sunday afternoon and there was a live band playing from 3pm till sundown. It added another charm to this area, where we had an early dinner watching the sunset from a terrace restaurant in the stupa area."

Since the Earthquake, someone decided it would be an added attraction to put up digital lights and signs to announce to those who may not be aware that they were at a spiritual site, not only the name, but the fact it is a \"World Heritage Site\" in big bold banners, which takes away from the spiritual nature and makes it more commercial. That and the sound, music? Hard to classify it. This should not keep tourists from attending, as Nepalies are suffering enough, between affects of earthquake and the illegal embargo on fuel, causing petro prices to soar, and market prices so high, that the average working family can not make due. You will see it all if you are brave enough to look."

We did the visit after two long international flights before even going to our hotel. perhaps we were too tired to fully appreciate the experience, but it was the only bit of a 16 day tour that left us feeling a bit underwhelmed. The lid (excuse the term) was knocked off in the earthquake and this doesn't help.In spite of this, if you visit Nepal, you need to experience it."

In the middle of a circular ground surrounded by three-or-four-story buildings mostly housing souvenir shops and coffee shops (some may have like guesthouses on the upper floors as well), this stupa with like four \"step-like\" levels (each level is smaller than the one below) above the ground leading to a big round structure above on top of which are four sets of Buddha's eyes under a cone-shaped hat is one of the \"must see\" places in this city with really only a small number of major sightseeing places (the others being Swayambhunath Stupa on a hilltop, the main Durbar Square, Garden of Dreams and Pashupatinath Temple which is for Hindus only).Also among the surrounding buildings are two temples with a big red dharma wheel (can be turned slowly by the rail around it); the first temple with a big Buddha in it also have a picture of Dalai Lama (right under the Buddha statue) and tall painting portraits of who I figured were the king and queen of Nepal, and the great thing about the second temple is its rooftop with railings around so you can safely view from there the Stupa below with these beautiful colorful cloth pieces on long strings coming down in all directions from above the \"Buddha's hat\" and also the surrounding colorful buildings.I rented a tour car with a driver just for myself to go to three destinations with this one first followed by Buddhanilkantha and Swayambhunath, costing 3,000 Nepalese rupees (about US$30), and it was about a half-hour drive east from my hotel in Thamel to get here (the tour was arranged at the hotel) followed by another half-hour's drive north to Buddhanilkantha and then about 45 minutes to Swayambhunath before returning to Thamel. Swayambhunath actually is walkable from Thamel (will just take about half an hour) but this one is too far to the east and Buddhanilkantha (which actually is a Hindu temple despite the name) is too far to the north, so I would say a combo tour like I did is definitely a good way to get to these distant places from the tourist area."

Everything are basically amazing, the Stupa (although when i came the top was destroyed), the various people from various countries and places came just to do the Kora (Circling the stupa 3 times), the monks that did their practice im mearby monastery, the pigeon, the dogs, sellers, almost everything are amazing. It is like coming back to the past, escaping from modernism and accepting the life in the present moment. From the architecture you can feel that, the use od bricks and the use of stone for road. The buildings were created so that it can make a harmony with the famous boudhanath stupa. I liked to sit down on the chair facing the stupa in the night just to enjoy the silent night with full moon after did my kora. It is definitely on of my favorite place, i aill definitely coming back to boudhanath and enjoy the present moment.By the way the tips is, don't eat near the boudhanath as the price is higher because it is the tourist area, eat at the local place.And don't forget, the stores and restaurants are usually closed around 8.00 so be quick. Cheers"

Yes, it has a lot of shops, hotels and restaurants all around to cater to endless stream of tourists.Each observation was 100% true. The attraction is very popular, not just amongst tourists but also amongst locals. You have hundreds and hundreds of devotees, monks and commons coming there to worship or offer prayers. You also have youngsters coming there just to \"chill\". The central attraction is a large earthen dome with some structures on top. Quite a bit of structure part was partly damaged during earthquake in April 2015. The local government and peoples' body of this area development committee is really doing monumental work of restoration. We saw a photo exhibition of the tremendous work that is being done, nice way of channelising peoples' energy and contribution to this work. Excellent."

The first references to the \"Great Buddha Stupa\" date as far back as the 5th Century and it is believed that the relics of the Kashyapa Buddha (the Third Buddha) were enshrined at its dome! Under it, four pairs of eyes, one for each cardinal point, watch us: Lord Buddha sees everything. This Stupa, so full of meanings and magic, is dedicated to the \"Buddhas of the Past, Present and Future\", and is also known as the \"Stupa of Enlightenment\". A lot of history and faith! Monks of all ages, in their red tibetan purple robes are seen everywhere. Join them, take your time, turn the prayer wheels and walk slowly, clockwise, around the main Stupa as many times as you wish. Enjoy moments of silence, inner reflection and peace.I visited Kathmandu on February 2015, nearly two and a half months before the terrible earthquake that devastated Nepal on April 25, 2015. As far as I have read, the \"Great Buddha Stupa\" has suffered minor damages and is already under restoration. The Boudhanath Area is again opened to visitors and a fee of Rs 250,00 is charged upon entry. Restaurants, souvenir shops, temples (e.g. Ajima Temple) and monasteries (e.g. Guru Lhakhang Monastery) can be easily visited. Support Nepal's reconstruction by not postponing your plans! Enjoy!"

The life surrounding the stupa is complex and simple at the same time. People from all strata--wealthy foreigners, local shop owners, artisans, pilgrims, Tibetan exiles, monastics, wily street kids, beggars, street dogs, and the occasional cat or monkey--mingle amongst well-behaved pigeons and the smoke and aroma of ever-burning incense and butter lamp offerings. Plenty of options for dining--from Nepali/Newari and Tibetan to Western cuisine--excellent for vegetarians! Duck into the shops showcasing Buddhist thangkas and allow the artists to tell you about their craft (I learned a lot and got to see some beautiful images of Mother Tara and Manjushri--which is what I was shopping for).

It's set to be the second largest Buddhist stupa in Asia,when renovations are complete, though with the exception of Cambodia. However, I just learned that China had since constructed the tallest stupa about a few years ago. Not sure about the exact date. Here at Boudhanath, you get to mingle with Tibetan people, who are in the majority here. They occupy thousands of shops that sell commodities like Cashmere sweaters, incenses, Tibetan Thanka and the famous Tibetan rugs. Nearby is the Buddhist temple. You will definitely find many Americans here, who are either studying Buddhism or just hanging out. I was surprised when I met Joshua Fouse, from California, who serves as a secretary to Kyabg\u00f6n Phakchok Rinpoche."

You will get a rare opportunity in centuries to see what sits behind the golden spire and eyes as the master craftsmen rebuild the spire by hand. In its long history, no one has ever seen what is behind the decorative cover. All the shops and restaurants in the stupa area are open and thousands of local people continue to walk around the stupa every morning and evening. The original Boudha Gate is still standing and the area gives tourists a very special taste of Buddhism in Nepal as it is surrounded by many large and small monasteries. Allow a good half day to take in all the sights."

But the damage was far less than portrayed, especially here at the Stupa.True, the top faces with Buddha's eyes looking in every direction was masked by scaffolding as workmen were busy repairing some damage to the tiles, but apart from a few fine cracks in the dome and little stupas surrounding the main one, there was much less damage than to be expected.And of course life around the stupa continues as normal. Buddhists from all around, Tibetans and foreign visitors walk around the stupa, turning prayer wheels and counting their beads. The little shops around the edge sell their beautiful handicrafts and the cafes and restaurants serve a wide variety of food. Heading out the back roads from the stupa, you find all sorts of local shops and restaurants, and little Tibetan cafes tucked down the alleyways. The atmosphere is tranquil and even if you don't have time for anywhere else, I'd recommend Boudha as a must visit place."

Last time when visiting Kathmandu Valley I missed out on seeing this stupa due to a flight change, so I was eagerly looking forward to it this time. This large, white stupa is surrounded by shops (selling candles, souvenirs, food, tattoos etc.) as with it's entrance way. Unfortunately, on my visit repairs were being done on the top section and it was covered with bamboo scaffolding and tarps. However the remainder was in good condition, with many people (both locals and tourists) visiting the stupa. The lower portion of the stupa contains many sections of prayer wheels along with a few statues and gates to the inside (no entry allowed). Decorated around the stupa are also many statues and flag poles (with many flags). Missing are the many prayer flags that are strung from the top and attached to the flag poles. They are still attached to the poles and are likely to be strung up once repairs are finished.Overall, an excellent place to see during a day trip of other sides around the valley and highly recommended. Although my visit was only very good, that's solely due to the necessary repairs and no prayer flags flying, i'm sure at a later date once everything is complete it will be back to it's glorious self, an excellent sight to visit and see."

It is known as Kh\u0101sti in Nepal Bhasa, Jyarung Khashor in Tibetan language (Tibetan: \u0f56\u0fb1\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f7c\u0f62\u0f0d Wylie: bya rung kha shor) or as Bauddha by speakers of Nepali.[2] Located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu, the stupa's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal.[3]The Buddhist stupa of Boudhanath dominates the skyline. The ancient Stupa is one of the largest in the world. The influx of large populations of refugees from Tibet has seen the construction of over 50 Tibetan Gompas (Monasteries) around Boudhanath. As of 1979, Boudhanath is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Along with Swayambhunath, it is one of the most popular tourist sites in the Kathmandu area.The Stupa is on the ancient trade route from Tibet which enters the Kathmandu Valley by the village of Sankhu in the northeast corner, passes by Boudnath Stupa to the ancient and smaller stupa of C\u0101-bah\u012b (often called 'Little Boudnath'). It then turns directly south, heading over the Bagmati river to Patan - thus bypassing the main city of Kathmandu (which was a later foundation).[2] Tibetan merchants have rested and offered prayers here for many centuries. When refugees entered Nepal from Tibet in the 1950s, many decided to live around Boudhanath. The Stupa is said to entomb the remains of Kassapa Buddha."

The earthquake had hit the city on our return but Boudhnath felt scarcely touched. Although everyone was in a state of shock, circling the great stupa seemed to bring a sense of normality."

Be sure to go around the stupa and meditate on Om Mani Padme Hum chants. At the front of the entrance of the stupa, you will see a buddhist temple (Guru Lhakhang Monastery). Go for a stop over and try to light an incensed candle. We went there inside. I was surprised that one of the monks (Brother Nawang) only asked our names and he started praying for us without asking our religion, donations or money. People inside were great and you can totally feel the genuineness of each and everyone."

There is unmistakable atmosphere in the mornings and evenings as the most devout Buddhists, nuns and monks do their circumnambulations. A rather ungrateful man who wanted to chat about Buddhism in the hope of receiving at least $20 in alms, detracted from my experience. But this is samsara and part of the experience is learning to keep equanimity and show compassion to all beings! Perhaps I should be grateful for his reminder of that! Some of the cafes are closed as it's quiet in terms of tourist numbers and many shopkeepers seemed quite non plussed. However it's still well worth a visit to Boudanath."

This meant there were no prayer flags flying from the spire which did detract from the atmosphere giving the whole place a less vibrant and joyous feel than usual. It was heartening to see monks, nuns and pilgrims worshipping as usual.The buildings around the Stupa seemed OK mostly and the cafes, restaurants and shops were open as usual. However, one of the monasteries on the Stupa circle was damaged and closed.I do not think it will be long before the repairs are complete and Boudhanath will be back to its best and worth a 5 dot review."

The painted eyes gazing solemnly over the countryside. Stupas are essential to Buddhism as the cross is to Christianity, a tangible symbol of the Buddha's enlightened mind.With a diameter exceeding 100 meters and a wall-to-wall length roughly equaling a football field, Boudha is among the largest stupa in the world- certainly the biggest in Nepal. The monument rises 36 metres above the street. The form and the alternated squares and circles represents a three-dimensional mandala, which is comprised of abstract religious concepts. Every portion has symbolic significance: the base, dome, square harmika, spire, and pinnacle represent the five elements; the 13 tiers of the spire stand for the stages to enlightenment, while the umbrella atop is the symbol of royalty. Boudhanatha is both an eye of calm within capital's dusty pandemonium and a sanctuary of Tibetan Buddhist culture amid a nation dominated by Nepal Hindus. Throughout its narrow streets, you can see posters of smiling Dalai Lama, Tibetan folk-medicine stores, traditional artisans' workshops, and restaurants serving everything from yak-cheese to Everest brand beer.The painted, bow-shaped eyes of Boudhanath are variously described as mysterious, indifferent, compassioinate and knowing."

We went right when it opened in the morning and got to see the temple with the sun rise colouring the entire place it was magical. There were a lot of pigioens so if your scared of birds not the best place but we loved it here. There was fun little shops that just kept going back until you had to almost crawl which was neat ( specifically a little bead and jewelry one). Recomend going early in the morning to catch it when its not crazy busy and hot and to get the beautiful colours!"

This is the place where you get a true whiff of the Nepali culture and experience firsthand how this beautiful mountain nation has managed to create a perfect mix of spirituality and tourism.It was the first stop in our daylong tour of the city's Stupas, temples and durbar squares. The moment you walk in, the \"Om mani padme hum\" music surrounds you and tells your brain that you've entered a sacred place that is a sanctuary inside a rather busy world outside its walls. Lots of shops all around the circle walkway (which i believe needs to be covered clockwise). Had a lovely early morning breeze during our visit, which made the experience even better.Plenty of helpful and friendly faces all around. You can feed pigeons which gather at a point halfway through the walk. You can climb the stairs of the stupa to get a more majestic view of the golden peak. Remember to buy a CD of the songs that play around the stupa, so you can relive the ambiance later in your living room. Boudhanath was definitely one of the favourites of our trip to Nepal"

It's one of the most sacred buddhist pilgrimage site. The white dome is believed to contain the relic of one of the past Buddhas \"Kashyapa\". The white color in Buddhism symbolizes \"compassion\". There are two eyes of Buddha in a square part just aver the dome symbolizing \"wisdom\" and \"action\" with a nose similar to a question mark in between, which actually is not a question mark, it's the number \"1\" in Nepalese, symbolizing \"Unity\". The upper part of the stupas has been destroyed by the quake of 25 april 2015 and is in renovation.This is a must visit place in Kathmandu valley if you ever go to Nepal. Surrounded of numerous buddhist monasteries, Boudhnath is one of the Buddhist sanctuaries where you can witness hundreds of pilgrims and monks turn around the stupa with a prayer wheel or chaplet all the day but it's more frequented in the morning and evening.The terrace restaurants around the stupa provide a chance to observe the grandiose and beauty of the stupa."

It's a lot to take in, though, and I'd recommend a couple of visits to fully appreciate this massive stupa. Another tip is to go early in the morning; 7am or earlier, to experience the locals' prayer rituals (later in the day it's a lot more touristy, and a lot less awe-inspiring). I've also heard that going in time for the evening prayers is amazing, but I didn't get a chance to. There are loads of monasteries around the stupa and I wish I'd taken the time to check them out (during our visit, however, it was too hot for our Scandinavian thermostats for us to do anything for more than an hour at a time). So, to sum up: Go Early and Take Your Time."

Boudha or Boudhanath Stupa is beautiful, it stands high and mighty, unaffected by the earthquake but that's all there is to it.It's a shoppin area more than a spiritual place. All around the stupa there are shops and some have very beautiful things but then it takes all the attention from the Stupa itself. There is a cafe called Mochiko Cafe and that's my best memory of Boudha. They serve excellent buff momos, and buff shapale (sort of a deep fried meat pie) ! And the hot chocolate is amazing! Apart from that, I love monasteries and Stupas but I like them quiet and peaceful.Also sometimes there are guards who take money from you to enter and sometimes there aren't, so be aware of that."

As of 1979, Boudhanath is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We had our lunch at one rooftop restaurant whilst observing some kind of monk pilgrimage and ceremonies being held on the Boudhanath Stupa.This is one of the best historical site in Kathmandu , a visit is highly recommended.However , if there's damage to the stupa and its surrounding , because of the 25 April 2015 earhquake, the Nepal government could restore it to its original state."

I was there when the Monks were chanting in their temple next to Stupa...so serene...went up to stupa and groups of Nepalese had to have their picture taken with me...a 5'7\" blonde American...I was taller than any of them...some by almost a foot...be sure to go into the large prayer wheel area...and buy the charms from the Monks who guard the large prayer wheel...I bought a dozen charms, and my guide talked them into taking a picture with me..."

We had lunch in one of the restaurants located in the square around the stupa and were able to enjoy the views while relaxing as well. While there were a lot of people at the site, it never felt crazed or rushed - everyone took their time to appreciate the beauty and inspiring story behind the stupa.Like most sites in Nepal, there is an entrance fee, but it's well worth the price for an afternoon spent soaking up the culture!"

About 10 kilometres from Thamel is the Boudhanath Stupa just one of the seven must see world heritage sites in and around Kathmandu. At 36 metres high, this three dimensional Mandala is the largest Stupa, and the centre of Tibetan Buddhist culture, in Nepal. There's a multitude of shops, restaurants, artisan workshops etc around the periphery of the Stupa, all under the central enlightened eyes of Buddha Although you can freely walk around, its best to negotiate a local guide so as to extract the most from your visit. The surrounding streets are also well worth a stroll.If you're into photography, history, religion, culture etc, you'll have a ball for the for your 250NPR entry fee."

It is quiet, peaceful with an aura of serenity. It is so interesting wandering around the little souvenir shops and in the square surrounding the Boudanath stupa. Stop for a cuppa masala tea in one of the rooftop restaurants. Highly recommended."

We visited Boudanath twice during our stay in Kathmandu, the only place we did visit twice such is the impressive nature of this iconic structure.For such a large stupa it is fairly well hidden from the road and the entrance is not obvious at first. This adds to the gravitas as when one does enter the large and calm area the Stupa sits in - it is a huge change in tempo. The prayer flags and the quieter cleaner atmosphere is telling. The Stupa it's self is massive. There is a wide pedestrian area around the stupa lined on the outsid with giftshops, Cafes and the like. Visitors and pilgrims, as in all Bhuddist sites, walk in a clockwise direction around the stupa.One can walk on the lower areas of the Stupa it's self. There are excellent views and vantage points to be had from the numerous rooftop cafes.On our second visit we ventured a little further into the complex. If you follow the small road / pathway which is directly opposite the main entranceway you can visit some small Bhuddist temples which are very very well worth a visit in their own right and would attract high Trip Advisor scores if listed separatley. Got some brilliant pictures at those.So all in in all Boudhanath Stupa is a fantastic attraction, an imposing religious site, a photographers dream and a true must see !"

Around the gigantic stupa you can navigate easily and find many shops and a European feel to the place. The shops form the perimeter and you need to walk clockwise to respect the Buddhist icon as all Buddhists walk clockwise around their edifices. Spin the many prayer wheels. We found a stall on a side street that sold Tibetan salt super cheap and clean. Get a face mask for the pollution you will find breathing in the air. It is free - no entry fee for foreigners!"

We visited at lunchtime and had a great meal on the elevated terrace of one of the restaurants - I think it was called The Best View Restaurant - and the view is certainly spectacular, of the stupa as well as the surrounding buildings and the snow covered mountains in the distance. We then went for a walk around the stupa and when up close its size is even more impressive, as are the multitude of prayer flags fluttering in the early afternoon breeze. We were so absorbed by the splendor of the stupa that we barely noticed the shops, and the never ending passing parade of visitors, monks and pilgrims made for a rich and textured moving tapestry of humanity. This visit was certainly one of the highlights of our few days in Kathmandu."

Tibetan arts, crafts and paintings besides singing or healing bowls deck encircle the stupa arena. Overall a must watch in the city as it just exists.

The Boudhanath Stupa is not only the largest to be seen in Kathmandu and one of the holiest places of pilgrimage for Nepalese Budddhist and neighboring Asian countries but the site for a one day stay with varied options. The stupa is approximately some 14 kilometers from the central area of Kathamandu. Local transport routes are indicated in Nepali only. A taxi costs approximately 600 to 500 Nepali rupees. Most taxi drivers will offer to wait for you some two to three hours to get the return fare as well.If you are passionate about photography, spirituality and having a days experience of leisure it might be wise to simply get a taxi back when you are ready.The stupa is surrounded by many shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s as well as four monasteries.There are many visiting Buddhist monks as well as pilgrims to be seen walking around the stupa as they carry out their spiritual practices.Entrance to the monasteries require only taking off your shoes and even though the monks are quite laid back even when carrying out their prayer, as a matter of respect it would be perhaps a matter of respect trying not to snap photos openly ( for example in the middle aisle as if you were observing some rare species.) Unfortunately some westerners seem to have just no regard for the spiritual practices of others snapping photographs with flash or standing next to prayer wheels and not allowing those in prayer to freely circle around.Entrance cost to this world heritage site cost 250 Nepali Rupees. This might very well be one of the cleanest and best well kept heritage sites to be found in Kathmandu. This is definitely a site well worth visiting.Enjoy the bliss of this profoundly spiritual place."

If you are not a Buddhist and visit this as a touristy site/sight, this will cause a degree of photo-frenzy. The temple itself is of course impressive and best enjoyed by climbing to the top or by looking across from the upper floor of one of the other temple buildings opposite. But the pilgrims and devotees are what makes this place really come alive. Tibetans, sherpas, a great variety of people of all ages and different geographical backgrounds and outfits walk around the temple, lighting incense and candles, clacking the prayer scrolls... Around the stupa there are many small shops selling jewelry, shawls, knick-knacks and medical supplies and a variety of restaurants from which to enjoy the view.There is an entrance fee of 250 rupees for foreigners. Keep a hold of the ticket; even though it says it's valid only for one day, in my experience nobody minds multiple entries as long as you have a ticket. The fact that there is a clean toilet for tourists shows that the money goes towards making this site comfortable as well as atmospheric.Surrounding the temple square are small roads filled with more shops and several other small temples and monasteries, e.g. the Shechen monastery, which has a few small stupas with placques telling the life story of Buddha, and a garden restaurant with great vegetarian food and even a variety of trustworthy salads."

This is important because the considerate visitor will not want to give offence by walking around the giant stupa in an anti-clockwise direction. Just \"go with the flow\" and follow everyone else. Being a stupa, there is no internal space to enter but you can climb up the lower levels and just soak up the atmosphere as you circulate the prayer flag be-decked structure.What is a stupa? Put simply, it is a solid structure in the shape of a squared circle that is like a 3DMandala,( a symbolic model of the universe used as an aid to meditation). Underneath a stupa there should be a relic of the Buddha or one of his followers. That is a ridiculously simplistic explanation, but it might get you started!In contrast to the simplicity of the stupa, the circular area surrounding it is a busy mix of temples, shops,cafes and handicraft stalls. In contrast to some other reviewers, I have never felt pestered by any of the retailers or seen any beggars during my 4 visits in recent years. If you want to buy something, however,you can expect some \"spirited\" bargaining. As well as plenty of tourist tat, there is a chance to buy some beautiful work of real quality; particularly thangkas of Buddhist deities.Even for returning travellers, this should be at or near the top of any \"What to do in Kathmandu\" list. A rare oasis of peace and calm in the beautiful chaos of Kathmandu."

Twenty years on and nothing has changed. Swayambunath is still beautiful but nakedly commercial now whereas Boudhanath has, if anything, gained in power and majesty. There are shops to visit, restaurants which will give you a decent meal and a great view of the place but, even without these, it is still the place I shall go to my grave recalling. This time I managed to hear a service in one of the monastery chapels and was very deeply moved. An utterly unforgettable place."

Prayer flags flutter by the thousands. Vehicular traffic is limited so there is peace and calm, complete with doves. The circular \"square\" i surrounded by shops selling paintings, religious objects and other related paraphernalia. In a painting shop you can ask to see the production process. Much of it is \"colour by numbers\" but the results are delicate and exquisite. Bargain to obtain a canvas at a good price. You can walk around the stupa itself and each turn offers a different visual delight. Do It and take your time. You will see locals in dream-like devotion, tourists, and other visions unexpected. It is a pleasure and one of Kathmandu's most revered Buddhist places. Ring the large prayer bells in some of the temples fronting the stupa. Take your shoes off and walk inside the Buddhist temples and take in the reverence and solemn moments of worship. You are welcome even if you don't observe the ritual. You will learn something about this gentle culture. They will welcome you as long as you are respectful.Nearby is a children's orphanage. Just look or ask the way. More pleasure. You can get a taxi to and from here at a very small fare. Or you can catch a bus from one of the many bus stops in Kathmandu. A pleasant afternoon adventure and well worth the visit. Remember that Pashupatinath is very close so you can go to both places in the same day. Take time to walk in the local streets and try some of the wonderful local street food on offer if you don't want to spend more in a westernised restaurant. Bless."

It is an unmasked version of Thamel, here every turn leads to a fascinating encounter, even the smallest passageway is so inviting to enter. The rickshaw, the textiles, the mannequins, another feast of colors matching the celebratory mood of no work Sunday.After a small sunday walk we had our Brunch and came back to our rooms for a small napA week around Thamel, I will be perfectly honest, a part of me misses the comfort and strange familiarity of India but there is a part of me willing to let it go, be contented of the memories of the life spent over there.In love with Nepal over and over again."

If you ever go to Kathmandu, it is worth including this visit to your itinerary. There are other adjacent places (like bazaars) you can include for shopping as well."

In its aerial view it represents the Mandala, but you'll be VERY satisfied just circling the stupa clockwise 3 times and rotating the prayer wheels. Better if you have a guide to explain the intricate details of the stupa such as the flags and the eyes and what they represent, but that's something a quick google search can fix. Shops circle around it, including the famous Thangka painting school, and more shops with funny names (I'll let you discover it on your own as you circle the area). Another interesting spot just near the stupa is a Buddhist temple where you can enter and actually take pictures of the Buddha inside, as opposed to the usual no-photos-allowed rule that most temples have.Overall, this place is worth another visit for every time you find yourself in the middle of Kathmandu. If you know anyone who is travelling to Nepal, encourage them to give this place a holler. It's worth it, and make VERY good photographs and memories."

It was fun getting there cause I decided to do that not by taxi but by public bus which was quite a challenge to find on a road. I kept asking: Boudanath? Buddanah? (those who knows Russian will understand why it sounds so ridiculous, he-he). Finally I found the right one and had a nice trip sitting close to nepalese women with kids.I entered the place and paid for the ticket (recently I heard there's some guesthouse in Tamel which gives a password so that you can enter for free). I didn't know what exactly to do and decided to roam around. As in some other touristic places, I did not understand the beauty of the place at first because of the crowd. It takes time to appreciate it. It takes time to slow down and relax, and see how meditatively people walk around the stupa and whirling prayer's wheels, how calm some people sit and behave, how funny and friendly the dogs are there (just fell in love with them!). So this is something one should do first when enter such places. Calm down and relax. There are actually a lot of things to do apart from selfies with stupa and beautiful flags (which I started with). They say you should go around (circumambulate) the Stupa 3 times clockwise and you get happy. Made it :) You see, I am!I enjoyed some names of guesthouses and cafes around (like Happiness Guesthouse) and there are many shops with souvenirs. Being not a fan of shopping I decided to go to one cafe on the second floor of the building (I think the name was something like \"Great view\"). Yes, very much enjoyed the view and veg momo (Nepal dumplings). And there I understood what happiness is. Without any rush or worries, without any expectations, just sit and look at the beautiful Stupa and breath the air around. Just be, here and now."

Buddhist people believe that the relics of the 3rd Buddha of Bhadrakalpa were enshrined in the dome. It's also called the Stupa of Enlightenment. It's also one of the largest and most significant Buddhist monuments in the world. It is religious and cultural and was enlisted on the \"World Heritage Site\" by Unesco in 1979. Today it's a major destination for pilgrims from all over Asia and the principal centre of Himalayan Buddhist worship and studies. People walk around the stupa in a clockwise route, called circumambulating. All of those who do this will acquire the 7 qualities of the higher existences! I am sure you have seen the two eyes on all stupas, these are the symbol of Method and Wisdom! All in all, a very holy and sacred place. Definitely one to see!"

Must have a driver who can drop you off and pick you up as parking is impossible. This is largest Stupa in the world. 100 years ago it was surrounded by fields. Now it is encircled by 4 storey buildings that create an almost magic circle full of atmosphere. Walk clockwise around the 365 prayer wheels with Buddhist monks. Browse the many tiny shops & haggle for original crafts. Must do is take refreshments on the roof top of one of the two restaurants that look over the Stupa. One is called The Golden Eyes Restaurant & Caf\u00e9. I cant give website address but google it and add Kathmandu and you will find the site. Attached is a picture from its terrace. You look directly into the eyes of the temple. Prices are cheap for quality Nepalese dishes or just delicious lemon and honey drinks. Next door there is another restaurant equally as good. We sat there for sunset and enjoyed the calm then joined the crowd of worshippers to walk round a couple of times. Best to set aside 2 or 3 hours and combine this experience with some other things like the several Word Heritage sites easily found on Tripadvisor. More interestingly go off the beaten track and visit Kirtipur, a nearby hill town now encircled by the sprawl of Kathmandu. Ascend the steps and you enter a world time forgot. No cars on the narrow streets and alleys that join together all the temples. You will be the only tourists and see Nepalese life the way its been for centuries. We were lucky enough to meet a guide Rajesh Shahi who took us. Totally trustworthy and able to bring what we were seeing alive. Speaks perfect English and Spanish. He can be reached on +984 193 8015."

The area hosts many tourist shops as well as Thanka studios and restaurants, many of which are worth a visit. This is one of the places where vendors probably won't harass you and call out to you on the street, but as always remember to keep your wits about you. During the day the sun gleams off the gold atop the stupa, but at night the whole area comes alive with the small flames if thousands of butter lamps and candles. This is most prominent during full moon, but you will probably see it on a somewhat smaller scale every night. Remember that you should always proceed to walk clockwise along the stupa, and never turn widdershins but rather walk around again if you miss something.

It is a very culturally and spiritually significant area and you can feel that significance by walking a couple laps around the Stupa in a clock-wise fashion. Well worth the visit!"

Sit back on a rooftop garden cafe and take the most amazing photos of the people and buildings."

The deal is to walk around clockwise 3 times spinning the prayer wheels and chanting Om mani padme hum which is a chant which helps you cleanse your body, mind and spirit from negative thoughts so you can receive positive ones. So we gave it a go. It takes about 10 minutes to do one lap so we were committed to doing this for 30 minutes. I did find it relaxing mainly because you clear your mind of thought except the chant. Nice to have a peaceful mind. We then headed on top of the stupa and our guide asked us to walk around the top in silence.The stupa is 120ft in diameter and is 43m high. The area of the stupa is 6,756 square metres. The stupa has been on the UNESCO world heritage sites list since 1979.Worth a visit."

I enjoyed being a witness to the people's devotion there as they prayed as they walked, some with beads, and also to statues in the open air. Children climbing the walls and teens sitting on a brick wall with lots of merriment to be together.

However you can escape from that by finding a high point view either from the rooftop of a cafe or entering inside the stupa and sitting on its high ground edge. There is an entry fee of 250npr. This attraction is not large at all and may only take approximately 1hr to explore (because you're only allowed to walk in a clockwise direction, entering and exiting the stupa structure itself may involve several laps).

We instead caught some music shops playing them (which was equally soothing) and some other old folks performing the prayers at noon.

Saturday early morning is probably the best time to visit, when the local Tibetan community are out in force circulating the stupa in what is known as kora, spinning their prayer wheels and chanting mantras. The scent of juniper incense and the devotion of the worshippers, many prostrating themselves full length as they make their kora all add to the atmosphere. There are a number of restaurants around the base of the stupa of varying quality serving an eclectic array of dishes. There are also numerous shops selling curios and CDs of buddhist chants. Tibetan festival days are particularly lively, but worth a visit any time."

We did get a guide for 400 rupees to learn more about the history, but although genuine in the information they provide they end up taking you to a Thanka artwork school that professes that the proceeds go to the students painting the Thankas, which is just a tactic to sell overpriced paintings. The paintings are highly overpriced and you can find them all over Nepal. If you are looking to buy the paintings from this area make sure to bargain similar to any of the other shops in Nepal. It is still a great area to visit in Kathmandu given the cool restaurants, shops and the stupa."

You get to walk through back streets of a little suburb and just observe life. Stupa was nice however I have seen bigger and more impressive ones. All the same I would recommend it as a half a day trip. There are also souvenir shops and restaurants all around so you can have a lunch there before continuing somewhere else."

The largest Stupa of its kind, it traces its root back to shortly after the Buddha's death over two millenia ago. It is quite an experience to join Buddhists of all nations as they walk around the Stupa (always in a clockwise direction), sometimes chanting, sometimes spinning the prayer wheels, sometimes meditating, sometimes prostrating themselves, but always with a degree of reverence.I originally sought refuge in the Buddhist community at one of the gompas (monastery) at Boudhanath a few years ago. This November, I returned to take my lay vows and was treated to a blessing ceremony conducted by three monks at the same monastery. It was quite elaborate, with singing, chanting, music, prayers and blessings. A very memorable and moving ceremony for me, and one that I will never forget.There is a lot of commercialism surrounding the Stupa, but the stores are fun to poke around in. You can always find a good souvenir to remind you of your time at this magnificent site."

Stay awhile, visit the monastery nearby and observe the buddhist rituals, perhaps you will catch a glimpse of the monks making their rounds on the stupa. It is truly an amazing experience.

This was our stop around lunch time. We ate on a rooftop restaurant and we were all the way up on the fourth floor. The view of the stupa was very good. We had a nice hot meal and a few beers and bottled water. It was a great vantage point to people watch. We had very good view of the Kathmandu Valley and the aircraftlined up for final approach into Kathmandu Airport. It was a beautiful day to sit in the sun or in the shade of an umbrella as we did and relax for an hour. After lunch we explored the stupa and we were encouraged to walk around on the roof of it as others were doing. There were all kinds of street hawkers selling wares. I admit to being interested in \"singing bowls\" but quite honestly I had never heard of one before I arrived in Kathmandu. It is no different than a tuning fork that puts out a sound as it resonates as it vibrates. The bowls resonate and it is a pleasant sound. I was not willing to spend so much on spun metal though. the stupa was beautiful and you should go see it. Counting lunch and walking around we were here about two hours."

There is also a temple right across to Boudhanath's entrance, that you can walk up for a nice view of the area. It's free and would suggest taking a look.There is a fee to come into Boudhanath from the major streets, but found early in the morning, no one is there.

Boudhanath Stupa is a site like no other, imbued as it is with the daily devotion of tens of thousands of Buddhists who circumambulate at dusk and dawn, chanting mantras, counting rosary beads and turning prayer wheels, all out of the faith that these actions, performed with the correct motivation, will add to the world's much needed store of spirituality and peace. It is a colorful crowd that walks around, generally at a healthy pace, including Himalayan folk from across the entire mountain range, including Bhutanese, Tibetans, and many others, all in their local dress. Try to come on the full moon, when the stupa twinkles with lights, and the crowds are even larger. Have tea or a meal in one of the many cafes that sit two floors up, overlooking the world going by."

Take a closer look at them, there is a prayer on each one. We didn't go inside but there is plenty of religious things going on outside to get your inner golden child flowing.. Including huge prayer wheels that you can spin in outlying temples or just the small prayer wheels on the temple itself.The property itself basically consists of a round temple which is radially lined with souvenir shops. One thing about these shops... If you must purchase here, bargain. Hard. The shop owners will come up with every excuse in the book as to why they can't come down in price. It's all garbage... For instance we found these mini prayer wheels for sale for 1800 nepalese rupees, we got them for 1000 after some bargaining. (Disclaimer: I've spent some time in this part of the world, so I'm pretty good at bargaining. The trick is to get them to smile.)If you have time to shop elsewhere I promise you that you will find that one-of-a-kind precious bespoke heirloom at ten more stores and much cheaper than this location to boot. I promise. Oddly enough we found an item that we were searching for from a shop here at the stupa much cheaper in Thamel shopping district. Stupa shop price 4700npr Thamel shop price, no haggle: 3500npr. Shop smart.I suggest when you come here you dine at a rooftop restaurant. Then you go to some of the open temples around the stupa itself, spin a prayer wheel or two, take a couple of photographs and get the hell out.Shopping tip: never go the the main frontal stores, instead go to the ones in the back allies, they need the business more. And are more likely to come down in price. Don't beatraid the allies here are safe."

The five Buddhas also personify the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether). The bottom of stupa is surrounded by 16-sided wall. It closely associated with the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Padmapani), whose 108 forms are depicted in sculptures around the base. The mantra of Avalokiteshvara - Om Mani Padme Hum - is carved on the prayer wheels beside the images of Avalokiteshvara around the base of the stupa. During the festival of Losar (Tibetan New Year) in February or March, Boudhanath hosts the largest celebration in Nepal.How to go:- Taxis are available on the main road by the main stupa gate.- Local bus (mini van) to Chabihil , from Chabihill, take one of the many buses/vans to the 'Bouda Stupa main gate' ,or walk for 20 mins. up the Boudha road to the Stupa. -by bycle (that's waht i did)"

The place has a very peaceful and serene environment that would make your senses numb. The best time is to go at around 5PM and stay there to see how the temple in lit with thousands of lights during the evening. There are food courts circled around the Stupa but do not expect meaty meals in them. Some monks and sorcerers may come and ask you for money. I guess you should know well before you pay them. usually they take the payments in form of donations and they also give you a receipt. Overall the spot looks great.

It is unlikely other temples in this country where you see just lots of buildings and crowds, here lots of tibetans come through a long way just to worship. It is quite touching when you see those elderly people making their daily walk around the stupa morning to night. However, when we went to there, like anyone else just started walking around the stupa, a man approached us making small talks. I consider myself generally a nice person so we didn't turned him down, kept talking with him like where we were from etc, and he praised us and gave us some Tibetan scarf as gifts. We gave him some same kind stuff as in return. Then he led us inside the stupa and suddenly changed his face, saying he got some medical problem, asking us for money, specifically stated UK money! We were stupid enough to give him a few notes as the conversation before had been well. Then he wasn't satisfied with \u00a320, kept asking for more. We had to run away so to get rid of him. It is such a shame as such a thing happened in such a place. I believe that wasn't the first time the man did such things as we thought back. The whole thing was well planned. I believe there are more like him, not to mention everywhere in Nepal especially in KTM kids on streets asking for money out of the blue. Anyway, the whole time in Nepal is quite an experience for me."

Dont go at the afternoon. It will be close. In front of the Stupa, there is a restaurant. You can have a best view from there. Eating there would be great experience too. You will have to walk little high to visit stupa. Its ok though. You can do it.Note that, you can come to stupa from Phewa lake by boat.Enjoy."

Sitting heavily in the middle of a square surrounded by shops the stupa blankets everyone who gets close enough with a hush.We had a guide for the day so the information we got regarding the stupa was more detailed and in depth then f w had been on our own. But the guide bok shave plenty of information as well. Walking clock wise circle the base of the stupa and look at the prayer wheels. Follow the crowd and turn them as you pass, keeping in mind your hopes and dreams. Then after your full circle come back to the stairs and ascend. Continue moving clockwise, dont go against the flow now. Look u and see the eyes of Buddha watching over everyone. These eys appear repeatedly in the Nepalese culture as they are indeed believed to be watching you all of the time. So be good always basically. The flags are prayer flags and are many. Walk amongst them.Up on the stupa it is even more peaceful and the continuos Ohm Mane Padme Ohm from the shops can be very soothing. Take your time. When you come back down the stairs its time to visit the shops.This probably the best place to buy Thangkas and SInging Bowls. Thangkas are priced according to who has painted them and size. They depict stories of buddha and beliefs. Choose carefully and be honest with what you can and cant afford. The salesperson when I bought a small thangka for my husband couldnt believe that $1000 AUD was out of my price range. !!!!Singing bowls bought here are the best. This is not the only place to buy them, but the best that I found. Each bowl reflects the 7 chakras withing the body and is made up of 7 ingredients. A well made bowl will resonate after being struck for an exceptionally long time. I did pay a few hundred for a small to medium bowl but am overjoyed with it. You can get singing bowls anywhere in Thamel, I knw this, but keep in mind f thats what you are happy with, thats fine, but it does not have the same quality. A proper singing bowl will resonate and have only 7 ingredients, not 9 and not 5. 7. Around the stupa you will also find many cafes. I wish I had paid more attention but we visited a rooftop onethat had an awesome mojito. Perfect lunch time beverage to go with my momos. Momos and mojitos. My suggestion is visit the stupa, look through the shops, get you haggling out of the way then stop for a bite to eat at one of the roof top cafes."

We were hustled into a Tibetan Thanka gallery and studio for a demonstration and sales pitch. There are lots of shops selling Tibetan Thankas around the Boudhanath and prices seemed reasonable.When I visited again 8 days later the crowds were gone and I was able to make a couple of circuits of the Stupa, spinning the prayer wheels and going up one level for another circuit and some nice photos. If you find the room with the two giant prayer wheels go in and give them a turn. There was a small monk in the room who, if you made a donation, would tie a string around your wrist.

Only thing I don't like is that hotels and restaurants start to put out these ugly illuminated advertisments - that should be forbidden on a world heritage site. It gives such a strange look on evenings."

While you can visit for a day, I'd recommend staying overnight close by. Then set the alarm and get up just before dawn to walk around the stupa. You will need to brave the crowds, but this will give you a true experience of the importance of the stupa to people (during the day the stupa is quieter, but primarily visited by tourists)."

Bouddhanath is the center of Tibetan culture in Nepal. The 36-meter-high stupa of Bouddhanath is one of the largest stupas in South Asia. Bouddhanath Stupa was renovated by Licchavi rulers in the eighth century. The mandala design in Bouddhanath is a copy of the one in Gyangtse in Tibet. The stupa is located in the area of ancient trade route to Tibet where Tibetan merchants rested and offered prayers for many centuries. When refugees entered Nepal from Tibet in the 1950s, many decided to live around Bouddhanath. Hence, a complete township has developed around Bouddhanath. The stupa is said to entomb the remains of a Kasyap sage venerable both to Buddhists and Hindus. Smaller stupas are located at the base. Gompa monasteries, curio shops, and restaurants surround Bouddhanath."

The point of the trip was to write, and I got most of my inspiration by sitting on the third floor of Ariya Cafe looking out the windows at the stupa. The site itself is impressively large and decorative. It especially makes a stunning outline against the sunset. More than the actual structure, though, I was intrigued by the life that goes on around it. Families walk khorra (circumambulate the stupa) before taking kids to school and after the work day is over, while some older Tibetans might walk all day, prayer beads in hand and a compassion chant under their breath. You can also catch monks, nuns, young couples, and people of every age and ancestry walking khorra (including tourists like me). Additionally, there are several nice shops along the khorra path; you can buy books, singing bowls, mandala paintings, or cheaper jewelry, clothes, and nick nacks. Boudhanath is a great way to experience a mix of Tibetan, Nepali, and Indian cultures in a place of deep Buddhist spirituality."

I'm a frequent traveller to Kathmandu and no doubts Bouddhanath is the place many tourists are coming for: it is spectacular and thrilling for one visit, but it is also a comfortable, tranquil and peaceful place to live as well.I lived in Kathmandu in many places: in different Patan places and around Thamel. While Patan might be convenient for a group travel it is definitely uncomfortable for a single women because shops and restaurants are rather far away from hotels, streets are dark and lonely and it is rather boring. Thamel is crazy and only certain type of people would like to be touched, shouted and disturbed every minute. Could work for a day or two, but not more!Bouddhanath is almost perfect. I would enjoy walking around stupa even at midnight, restaurants are very close and small shops make it not even necessary to go outside. Moreover, here is peace and fresh air that you cannot find in Kathmandu at all! It is beautiful, i loved to go to the roof and to see sunrise over Bouddha and to see all the surrounding golden monasteries. there are many locals who live their life and perform daily prayers not really bothering to sell something and attack you.There are only two minor disadvantages: it might get rather difficult to get in and out from Bouddha due to traffic jams; and food in restaurants is not that advanced and might get boring especially for vegetarians after a while. Otherwise-definitely recommend. I was trying and experimenting a lot before i found my comfortable place to return when i go through Kathmandu and Bouddhanath is definitely that."

Once again, having a local guide is worth having for checking this location out, as ours, Padme, provided a great explanation over the symbolism and history of the Stupa. I don't have much experience exploring Buddhist, Hindu, or Lamaism structures, so seeing all the prayer wheels ranging from two liter size to larger than a car standing on its bumper was a unique experience. The square is surrounded by many souvenir shops. My guide helped me pick out a handmade 800 gram singing bowl for 4000 rupees (about $40)."

Not sure why it's touted as the biggest stupa in Asia, Shwedagon in Yangon and Borobudur in Java are definiely bigger, probably even Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai. Nevertheless, it's impressive, but from all the descriptions, I thought it would be huge. It's not. There are several rooftop restaurants around, which looked nice but I didn't try.I went there on the full moon day yesterday when the crowds celebrate Buddha's birthday. Which meant no ticket fees were collected, so that was nice. After many similar rituals in Thailand, I was expecting the crowds yes for sure, but I was disappointed that there was hardly any serene atmosphere. More like a mad dash around the stupa, and lots, LOTS of youngsters who were running around, yelling, some with alcohol on their breath, making an atmosphere that looked more like the aftermath of a winning football match. There were no monks or security or anyone trying to deal with them. There was no chanting, prayers, sermons, or people walking around in a meditative state. Having said all this, it was nice for taking photos well before sunset (I arrived at around 4 and left at 8:30), lots of people in traditional costumes, some monks, some schoolkids in processions carrying flags and statues of the Buddha, many young kids wanting a conversation in English. It was a nice atmosphere, and interesting place for people-watching, just not I was expecting for a holy day."

You'll experience seeing Tibetan monks, people chanting, candles & incense (no bodies- yuk) burning and prayer wheels, Handicrafts can be found all around the outer circle. I bought prayer flags & a poster for a teacher I know. Wish I bought a Thangka (a Nepalese art form exported to Tibet) while I was there. The Thangka and Singing Bowls are the must have handcrafts. The Stupa sparks a peaceful feeling that has to be experienced. When George from Seinfeld says \"serenity now\" this is where he'd want to be. You don't need to be a Buddhist to experience it."

            "review": "The Super Bodnath Stupa. One of the ultimate things to do in Kathmandu is take a visit to the Boudhanath Stupa. This stupa is located close to the airport, and not far from the best (and most expensive) hotel in town, the Hyatt Regency. It took me around 20 minutes in a taxi from Thamel to get here, and it cost around 500rps each way, which is an acceptable price so I didn\u2019t even bother haggling! Boudhanath is a vintage UNESCO World Heritage Site and is the largest Buddhist place of worship in Nepal. It dominates the skyline of Kathmandu, although due to haze and pollution it may not always be visible from downtown.Entrance is 150RPS for everybody unless you are from India or Sri Lanka. I think the admission is worth the price, as it really is one of the main tourist sites not only in Kathmandu but also in Nepal overall. Around the outer perimeter of the stupa are little antique and handicraft shops as well as quaint caf\u00e9s and bars, many of which have rooftop verandas with views down over the stupa. All of this adds to the vibe and atmosphere of the place and makes you realise that your admission price was for more than just taking photos of a big pair of eyes!One of the great things about the Boudhanath Stupa is the prayer flags that are draped all around it. I have seen many of these in Bhutan, but as this was my first trip to Nepal I was surprised to see them here, too. There are prayer wheels all around the stupa as well, and despite not being a Buddhist I nevertheless still enjoyed turning them with my hand as I walked past. It should be noted that you are supposed to walk in a clockwise direction around the stupa as a sign of respect.Of course, with this being Nepal, the area wouldn\u2019t be complete with a little rubbish on the sidewalk and building work haphazardly being undertaken in the vicinity, but I always felt safe around here, and the workmen are usually very friendly and get out of your way when taking photos. I didn\u2019t take any pictures of any of the many Buddhist monks around here, as I wasn\u2019t sure if that was permitted or not, but they were all dressed in red robes, with orange scarves, and seemed to be hurriedly darting from one area of the stupa to another. It was a nice colourful change from the stark white of the stupa itself.You can ascend the Boudhanath Stupa up to the second or third levels, and again walk around clockwise, although there are no prayer wheels up here (there are more prayer flags though). You can get good views of the action down below and can actually have a better indication of your whereabouts as you are higher up. A word of warning, though, if you are scared of birds: there are hundreds of dirty pigeons around the Boudhanath Stupa. I guess in some countries these pigeons would have been forced to leave to make the place a little more hygienic for the monks and tourists, but I guess in this part of the world it\u2019s just par for the course! I almost had a couple of pigeons fly into my face as I was walking around taking photos, but fortunately I survived!"

Getting up on the Stupa and walking around provides a good overview of the area and shops. Then you know which shops or restaurants do you want to visit. I went to a newly opened Circle Street Cafe which didn't have a great view of the Stupa but one of the best Nepali coffee, cleanest toilets, and the friendliest owners and staff I'd seen in KTM. The rooftop had a nice view of the street! All in all, a nice place to visit, but I won't call it a must-visit.

It is the center of Tibetan culture in Kathmandu and rich in Buddhist symbolism. The stupa is located in the town of Boudha, on the eastern outskirts of Kathmandu. After the arrival of thousands of Tibetans following the 1959 Chinese invasion, the temple has become one of the most important centers of Tibetan Buddhism. Today it remains an important place of pilgrimage and meditation for Tibetan Buddhists and local Nepalis, as well a popular tourist site."

The former too are more religious, Pashupatinath being a sacred Hindu temple. Since we were not religious tourists, the Stupa felt like a great relaxing spot, after a long day of sight seeing. We reached Bodnath around 5pm, and it was just beautiful. The Stupa stands alone in the centre surrounded by a cosy circle of shops, cafes, hotels and eateries, largely Tibetan. The campus is clean and has a peaceful feel to it. We had some iced tea, walked around and enjoyed some evening photography in the setting sun. It was an hour well spent!"

It's not just the knowledge that it is one of the most important Buddhist sites but rather the experience of being amongst genuine devotees who pray here (or in the many nearby monasteries) everyday. This is the main focus for Tibetan refugees in Kathmandu, and as you walk round (always clockwise), spin the prayer wheels, and try to take it all in, you are surrounded by Tibetans in their traditional dress, with prayer beads in their hands as they chant the mantras.In spite of the crowds Boudhanath always feels calm, and peaceful. On a practical level there are many good cafes and restaurants at rooftop height to sit and absorb the whole scene, with snow capped mountains in the far distance. Getting to and from Boudhanath is very easy by taxi from central Kathmandu and I recommend that you try to go independently if you can (not with a group) so that you can really take your time, and explore the whole area at your own pace."

The Bodnath Stupa was simply amazing - Thamel and Kathmandu are covered in temples and stupas everywhere you look, so I was expecting Bodnath to be more of the same, but it is really different. I'm not into the whole spritualism go find yourself in kathmadu thing as was only in town as I'd been working in Delhi and had a free weekend - but even so I was really taken by the atmosphere this place has. There is something very calming about the area around the stupa, it could be the relaxing chanting and singing, the smells of incence or something else, but wandering around the monasteries and soaking up the atmosphere here is something I can't get enough of."

The other shop (near the Himalayan cafe, also called Himalayan Crafts or something like that), only 10 steps away from the first shop, have prices on every item and the same book only cost about 500! After all my shopping, the honest owner even gave me further discounts on the entire bulk I bought, without pushing at all.If you are looking for mountain or trekking gears, better go to town.

Relics of the Buddha are purported to be contained in the site. We ate overlooking the stupa as darkness fell. I regret not arriving sooner and having more time. I would allow 1-2 hours depending on whether you wish to eat while here and how many of the surrounding shops and attractions you would like to visit. There is a small fee for tourists. It is a crowded area so it is wise to plan a meeting spot both for your fellow travelers and, in particular, for your driver if you have one.

Look out for the ones, wearing gloves and sliding grips on long wooden boards. Fascinating place to 'people watch'. The stupa itself is magnificent with the eyes peering out at you, with the gold at the top, contrasting beautifully with the simple white of the lower part of the stupa. Hundreds of prayer flags flap in the breeze overhead, while drumming and chanting can be heard in the various Tibetan monasteries in the area - also worth a visit for their elaborate interiors.

For a while, we just stopped and stared. There were people just slowly walking around, gently sliding their hands around the gold coloured drums and turning them. We now know them to be prayer drums. The idea is to walk around the Stupa, clockwise only, rolling each drum and praying. I am not really religious, but this was just breathtaking, peaceful, awe-inspiring... the list is endless.

At dusk the atmosphere comes alive as all the Tibetan community and other Buddhists come out and make 'kora' - three laps of the stupa, clockwise. Enter the gate and do a lap of the stupa up on the first terrace for great views. Eat at Stupa View, Casita or the new Roadhouse on their terrace. Bouda is a great place to stay and far nicer than the bakcpackers ghetto of Thamel. I live about twenty minutes walk north of Bouda at Kapan just below the gomba. There are a system of homestays there or use the Shambala Village Resort (nice people, clean/simple rooms). Shopping at Bouda is generally more expensive than Thamel. Change your money outside on the main road for better rates. Try lunch at the Chechen Gomba for a peaceful meal."

Wandered around the shops surrounding the stupa and just people watched for a while as I saw other tourists, locals, and pilgrims come to worship. Amazing experience!! A+"

Walking paths to Durbar Square are always crowded and the Monkey Temple is often overloaded with both tourists and nasty tempered monkeys.But one spot remains relatively serene--Bodnath Stupa. Unlike most religious shrines in Kathmandu, this stupa remains relatively simple and is maintained by Tibetan Buddhists. A feeling of reverence prevails as you circle the stupa clockwise, and you can visit a number of monasteries that surround it to further your experience.I visited twice during my 3 week stay in the city, both times in the late afternoon when the sunlight is optimal. Catching it near sunrise would also be recommended.It's not walking distance from Thamel, so be prepared to bargain with a taxi to get here. There is a nominal fee for westerners, but the ticket taker may be on break occasionally (I didn't have to pay for my second visit)"

It's about a 400Rs cab ride from Thamel and 300 from the Kathmandu International Airport, and we payed 1500Rs per night for accommodation. They charge 150Rs per day for non-Nepalese to enter the complex unless you tell the guard you're staying inside. The collective energy of the monks and visitors will make you feel like a happy little balloon, especially at dawn and dusk when the most people come to walk around the stupa and pray (always walk clockwise!). There are tons of shops and restaurants along the outer wall selling clothes, jewellery, art and snacks that you can bargain for. A few ragged dogs live in the stupa village that sleep all day and make aggressive sounds at night, but they seem pretty harmless otherwise. Most restaurants have wifi but the two best connections are at restaurants called Flavours and The Roadhouse. Definitely worth a day trip at the very least but we recommend spending a couple nights!"

It cost only 15-25 rupees one way, that's really cheap compared to taxi which will cost you around 300 rupees. Besides, I think it's really good way to know more about how local people live, and talking to local is a really good thing to do in this city. ^^"

I expect that the best times to see it is early morning and late evening - when the lighting is gentler. I missed the full moon which would have been wonderful. I went in the middle of the day and it was still worthwhile. I recommend spending at least 2 hours here \u2013 time to walk around the temple, explore some the of the small stalls and also to take the time to enjoy one of the rooftop cafes. Sitting at one of these cafes allows you a quiet moment just to enjoy the temple and surrounding s. I had my taxi wait for me so took a round trip from my hotel to the temple. exploring the store is also very pleasant"

All Tibetan guys and girls were dressed up and gathering around the stupa. Mixed in to the crowd circulating the stupa was an other-worldly experience for me. The time seemingly ticks different here.The less exciting part is the dusty road oh the way to this place and occasionally some kids will asked money from you. I just refused boldly and eventually just ignore them. The local adults would scold the kids when they get persistent."

When the coffee shop opens up, have your coffee there, it's near where they feed the pigeons handful of corn, you may be lucky to witness the painting of the stupa or notice on another day that the pigeons peg away the green algae which collects on the stupa overnight. By 10:00 in the morning the pigeons have cleaned the whole stupa back to white again, remarkable sight!But once in a while the whole stupa is painted, a great sight as well, I was lucky to film the whole process when I got there one fine morning. You may check this out on YouTube in November 2013.Willem Rieder"

You can climb the stupa and walk around on different levels and get different views of the location. As soon as you get through the gate that separates the chaos and noise of Kathmandu from the peace around this enormous building, you realize the visit is worthwhile. The area around it is pedestrianized. I loved those watchful eyes of Buddha\u2019s (that attract you), the blessings, the smell of incense, the brightly coloured Tibetan dresses, the flags around the stupa, the guest houses, the restaurants & the souvenir shops around. All your senses are assailed and overwhelmed by the experience!Walk around the stupa (clockwise of course!!). Enjoy Tibetan people walking kora (peregrination) turning the prayer wheels around the perimeter. Witness devoted religious people meditating and praying to the stupa. Admire all the little Nepali flags blowing in the wind. Listen to the soothing music coming from the Buddhist singing school. Turn the great prayer wheels. Experience this ancient monument and its Medieval feel! One could just stare at the Stupa for hours and watch the world go by. Peaceful, enriching, relaxing, profoundly spiritual for people of all faiths. Good place to see something of the Buddhist culture of Nepal.This World Heritage Site is something to experience for yourself rather than to describe (as pictures don't do justice to this attraction). Foreigners must pay admission fee.A one of a kind experience! Well worth a visit. Very enjoyable. A spiritual and magical place, ideal to meditate and thank Nepal for places like this! An absolute must for spiritual seekers."

While get enter to the sanctum of the main Stupa,visitor can make a circle around of it. The different colors of the prayers flags blowing over our head look interesting.

It is without a doubt one of the most awe inspiring and powerful places one can ever visit. Once you become accustomed to the beggars and street vendors that are ever present throughout South East Asia you can really start to feel the energy of the place. Spiritual practice and mediation are encouraged and often enhance by the amazing setting. Take plenty of time to visit the Tibetan monasteries, shops, and cafes around the stupa as they are the most authentic window into Tibetan culture to be found anywhere outside of Tibet. As others have mentioned, full moon, new moon and special Buddhist holidays are always extra busy and there are often interesting performances or religious ceremonies going on. A visit to Bodnath is a worthwhile experience for people of all faiths but especially powerful for Buddhists."

Considering that their entrance fees of Rs150 compared to others of Rs1100, the committee for Boudhanath is doing a great job in keeping the environment clean and also the conservation and development of the site.The downside is the harassment from the tour guides and beggars, old and young. Suggest that trained tour guides be given a permit to solicit but must back off once a tourist declines. As for the beggars, confine them to a specific location at the exit where tourist can make donations at free will."

The place is beautiful, peaceful (even with the locals and tourists strolling about) and awe-inspiring.Entrance fee for foreign tourists is 150 Nepalese rupees (less than USD 2), which kinda shocked me, because the fee is so small for such a beautiful place. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site to boot, and so one must not definitely miss seeing the Boudhanath.Had a leisurely stroll here with my friend Madan, and I quite enjoyed looking around at the souvenir shops, which surround the entire stupa. Because I visited during the monsoon season, we encountered a light rainshower, which wasn't really much of a hassle since there are these quaint cafes beside the souvenir shop where you can sit and have coffee while waiting out the rain.Boudhanath Stupa is a lovely place, and everyone visiting Kathmandu should go see it."

This is one of the worlds most holy of Buddhist sites.Tibetan emperor, Trisong Dets\u00e4n (r. 755 to 797) is traditionally associated with it's construction. My favourite time to visit is just before dusk. The entire area takes on an even more mystical charm as darkness falls and candles begin to glow by the thousands. Monks descend upon the Stupa and make their ceremonial laps, chanting and walking. It is a sight to behold.It is about 10km from Thamel and taxi is the best way to get there. There are limitless food and beverage options or just grab a coffee and pastry from the one of many cafes if you desire. I prefer to pick one of the many restaurants located high above, on the surrounding rooftops. Usually they are accessed by a long flight of stairs and are fairly easy to spot if you look up as you walk around. These provide an amazing view and photographic opportunity, above and across from the Stupa. You can easily spend a couple of hours lazing away an afternoon enjoying a good meal and/or beverage on one of these amazing patios, taking in the iconic views and spiritual charm. Some of the best keepsakes can be purchased from the \"Stupa-side\" vendors and street merchants. There are countless shops and opportunities to leave with a unique souvenir. Highly Recommend!"

After an early flight to Everest in the morning and a long day in Durbar Square in the afternoon, I was afraid my fellow travellers had run out of steam for a visit to the Buddha Stupa, but having limited time In Nepal we made the effort. We were so glad we did. It is located on the edge of the city but a taxi ride through the manic streets of Kathmandu from Freak Street got us there late afternoon. A time which I understood was when all the Buddhist monks came out to walk clockwise around the base of the stupa and spin the prayer wheels. We entered through a gate area and paid the entrance fee but it seemed to only take us into the area where the temple stood. Not sure if you have to pay if you approach from a different street, but it wasn't much anyway. The stupa is impressive. Huge, with the eyes following you all the way round. The monks were certainly in attendance circa 5.00 pm local time and it was pretty crowded. This did not distract from the beauty of the place with many other religious buildings, shops and services, restaurants, cafes located in the immediate vicinity. We walked around a couple of times and spun the prayer wheels both around the base of the stupa and also the much larger ones located at various spots opposite. We were also able to walk up onto the upper level of the base of the stupa and walk round which gave you a different perspective of the structure and also the surrounding area. It really was beautiful and remains my wife's favourite place we visited in Nepal and possibly on our whole trip into India also. We were so glad we made the effort to come to this place late afternoon and as the sun dropped we just wandered around the local streets surrounding the stupa and took in the feel for this area of Kathmandu. You must see this place and although it is crowded the best time is late afternoon when you can be involved with the monks also."

There is such a peaceful and mysterious aura to this place, that I cannot really put it into words, it simply has to be felt....The Bodnath Stupa is one of the largest in the world and an important place of pilgrimage and meditation not only for Tibetan Buddhists and local Nepalis.Besides the shops there are lots of restaurants and rooftop cafes overlooking the stupa to eat e.g. fantastic momos, drink an 'Everest Beer', tea or coffee or just relax...So I think, it's an absolute must-do for anyone visiting Kathmandu."

Climbing the steep stairs up to stupa you are surrounded by children begging for money and locals trying to sell you their baubles. On the top you have to pay 200 Rs. entrance fee and once again - lots of locals who begin to tell you a stories and history of Kathmandu Walley.. of course for money. But of course - its Nepal. But the feeling is absolutely worth, stupa is amazing. Just stop for a while and enjoy the moment. And one small tip - enter the buddhist's temple on the right side of the stairs (when comming). I'm not rely sure if the visitors can enter there but we did and nobody ejected us. We spent there about 20 minutes listening proper budhists mantra singing accompanied with their typical music. What a power and energy, strong experience!"

We had a total of 20 hours sightseeing time during our visit to Kathmandu due to business every day we were there except two. With that said, if I had one place to go again, I'd go back to Bodnath Stupa. It was breathtaking (and the taxi took my breath away thinking we were going to die, but that is a different story). You walk in from the chaos that is the street (look close or you'll miss the entrance) and suddenly there before you is a start white temple with a gold top. It is awe inspiring. As with everything in Kathmandu, the hawkers are everywhere. A good firm \"no\" and even firmer \"I said no\" generally keeps them at bay. There is very good shopping for anything you could want around the temple, along with some very good restaurants to find shelter during the mid-day heat. Both myself and my colleague did all our touristy shopping after spending time marveling at the temple. Easily and afternoon of time to have a very good lunch, enjoy the temple then find some \"stuff\" for the folks back home. Do not miss this temple if you have time for only one."

What an astonishing relief was it to finally reach Bodanath and find it within a beautiful tidy square in an area that is being looked after by those who live there. The Stupa was magnificent and although the square around it is a bit of a tourist trap with countless shops, much as anywhere in Nepal, the selection of rooftop restaurants was great and reasonably priced. We had much needed lunch for just under 500rs for 2, whilst enjoying a magnificent view of the Stupa. If you do choose to walk to the Stupa however, I would recomend investing in a better map than the one provided by the hostels..."

However I enjoyed Bodnath Stupa so much more and learned an awful lot more about Napali culture just before I headed for home. At 7am there wasn't another tourist or camera in sight. The Stupa was busy with many worshipers and many praying monks. It was incredible to join in with the crowds circling the stupa, listen to the prayers and observe the dress etc. There was none of the carnival atmosphere I experienced on a visit to the Monkey Temple. My only regret is that I didn't visit there at 7am also."

The munchurian dish is simple but goes very well with long grain rice. The 4 faces apparently meant as a peace prayer to the 4 corners of the earth. It is far bigger than we have in mind. White paste for the stupa wall as well-wishing can be bought (the workman will do the work on your behalf) at the entrance. Watch out for pilgrims who might bow and pray as they enter/walk around or in the stupa vicinity. Lots of paintings and tourists shops around the stupa. We also tried Nepal Thuli set - back at hotel at Nagarkot, but not as well adapted to it. We had refrained from raw veggies, fruits, yogurts, cheeses for instance so as not to trigger unadapted stomach. We ended up good, without any need for medication. :-)"

I mean, the stupa itself is pleasant, but after walking around it, taking a photo or two (well, trying to between the foreigners and touts) and realising that the surrounding shops all sell the same stuff, there's nothing to really distinguish this from other places. There's little else of interest in the neighbourhood around the stupa, and getting to the area is a bit of a hassle. I'd recommend you get out of Kathmandu, away from the tourists and touts, and experience more of Nepal and the undoubted high quality (and far more 'spiritual') religious places that exist elsewhere."

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is said to be the holiest Tibetan Buddhist temple outside of Tibet. The stupa is located in the town of Boudha, which is about 7 km East/Northeast of Kathmandu. The stupa was built around 5th century AD.Other than being a popular tourist site, the stupa is a sacred place for meditation for Tibetan Buddists and local Nepalis. The most distinct feature of the stupa was the pair of Buddha Eyes on all four sides of the square tower. I also noticed the symbol between the eyes which looked like a question mark. From what I read, it is the Nepali character for the number 1 and symbolises unity.Colourful prayer flags, mantras and prayers printed on them, are tired to the stupa. The surroundings of the stupa were also a treat for the eyes. Souvenir shops, Buddhist monasteries and nunneries, a few restaurants and cafes are found around the stupa."

As you enter throught the gate and the stupa stands beneign, strong immutable before your eyes you can experience a rush of peacefulness. Most people especially the Tibetans make a small prayer gazing raptuously before moving on. Staying al day, you see the moods from the early morning Kora when hundreds of people circumnabulte the stupa, pausing to spin the prayer wheels around its edge, and often chanting Tibetan prayers or a simple Om Mane Padme Hum. Pigeons flock to be fed, circling the stupa rising and flowing each time they are disturbed. Sounds of chanting and Tibetan Buddhist prayers emanate from the various monsteries that are in the vicinity. Later, the shops open, the tourists come and take their requisite photos. It becomes a bazaar with shops selling magnificant singing bowls, prayer flags, incense, tibetan furniture, cute souvenirs and even solar powered prayer wheeels that will spin prayers into the strratosphere every time the sun comes out. Later in the day, butter lamps sellers set up their stands and you can pay to light lamps as a blessing for yourself and loved ones. The eyes of the stupa stare on sending out their message of peace. If you are in Kathmandu, you must go. It is one of the great power places and it affects everyone. With love."

Once you're inside the city noise fades away quite literally. There are monks and lay people alike praying and meditating, and its great for lunch or shopping. You can get great deals on beads and singing bowls and any souvenirs you want to take home. You can even get blessings from monks. The blessings are always free, but a nice tip of 5 or 10 US dollars to help fund their monastary is always advised. My wife and I visited three times because we loved the atmosphere at the stupa."

We could see it when we ate breakfast on the rooftop and made our way over to see it up close. Fantastic people watching- monks coming to pray, tourists, vendors all in one place. We wandered and listening to chanting which was so beautiful. If you want to immerse yourself in the culture, this is a terrific place to do it."

The Bouddhhnath stupa is also known as Khasti Chitya and is considered as one of the oldest stupas in the country.With a diameter of about 100m and a height of 40m, Bouddhanath is among the largest stupas in the world. The Bouddhanath stupa covers a vast area that has a circumbulatory path at the bottom and another path made of three-tier plinth. The stupa looks similar to Swayambhunath but many features in this stupa are pinnacles as well as 108 Buddhist Gods and Goddesses. The most attractive part of the Stupa is the all seeing eyes of the Buddha painted with red, white and blue. It is believed that King Manadeva built the Bouddhanath stupa during the Lichavi period. It has been renovated time and again and the present form of stupa was renovated in the 17th century.The most popular festival celebrated here is the Tibetan New Year festival Lhosar that falls in February. The festival starts with prayers and worship. Thousands, of Tibetans dress Traditionally and dance after lighting incense to Buddha. Lots of Tibetan comes from Laddakh, Sikkim, Bhutan as well as other parts of the hills to celebrate this festival. In Bouddhanath, there are many monasteries or Gompas. They are all beautifully decorated and colorfully painted. One can visit the monasteries and take photographs but you can always give small donation when clicking the photographs."

All day but mainly around dusk, religious devotees including many monks, walk in a clockwise direction around the outside of the stupa walls. The entire site is surrounded by a square of attractive high buildings, some containing shops on the ground floor and others with roof-top restaurants from which you can observe the scene. It is a great place to be, just watching the multi-coloured throng constantly on the move. We visited with a guide as part of a group the first time, then re-visited via the 'cultural walk' from the Hyatt Hotel on our last evening in Nepal. We went inside the stupa walls at around 18.00 but found that we could not get out again except by circling the whole stupa, just inside the wall. This was slightly embarrassing because we had to step through densely packed areas of devotees praying, although they did not seem to mind our presence. Normally you can enter a shorter circular walk near the stupa itself, in the centre of the site, but this was already closed by 18.00. We had a meal in the Buddha Kitchen restaurant, from where you can survey the ever-circling throng from their first-floor windows. It was a hypnotic site to visit and will stay long in our memory. (There is a booth at both entry points, stating a 150 rupees charge for foreigners but no-one seems to insist on payment if you just walk in with the crowd.)"

Pashupatinath overwhelms every visitor with its beautiful temple complex and ritual burnings at the river, its omnipresent colors and scents, and its constant crowd of people along cows and monkeys. By contrast, Bouddhanatah, located maybe only a km from Pashupatinath, submerges you in a complete opposite atmosphere. The huge stupa are an attraction for spiritual rest that you feel everywhere around you. It is good to do Pashupatinath first thing in the morning, take 1-2 hours to wander around and taste the atmosphere before it becomes too hot and then head to Bouddhanath to refind your breath, relax and pick out a nice restaurant with view for lunch on the stupa."

The edifice itself is not in itself 'wow' but its piazza like setting surrounded by guest houses, restaurants and shops make for an extremely enjoyable experience. Visiting as I did in the off season there were very few western tourists and yet there was always a throng of people chanting, walking, prostrating themselves lighting candles, spinning prayer wheels and hanging flags. There were far fewer touts that at the other tourist areas and there was a very relaxing and peaceful vibe to the place - it's not number one in the guide book for nothing! As a tip, do take the time not only to walk around the temple from the outside but also go in and walk around from the inside, few people do and it's a completely different experience...Hope this is helpful."

Then walked, looked at shops and the stupa and started taking photos. After 3pm everything started to get busy. We walked more, explored a monastery, looked at more shops, took more photos, stopped for a coffee - and all the while the hubbub of people around the stupa kept increasing. Just prior to sunset the clouds that had been building all afternoon rained briefly - and not very heavily. We bought some thangkas and bracelets just before leaving at 7pm.I could have stayed longer and taken a million photos. Highly recommended for culture, sights, eats, shopping and enjoying a traffic-free enclave in otherwise crazy Kathmandu!"

It is also the centre of the Tibetan community in Nepal with many Tibetan buddhist monateries and business surrounding it. It is a beautiful complex built in a circle so that many people can walk clockwise around the stupa for their religious daily routine. Especially at sunrise and sunset. One building in the outer circle with a huge bell in front is definitely worth stepping inside. It contains a very large golden buddha statue. It also has a small room at the entrance with a 3 meter high cilinder bell, as well as a man-size bell outside with inscriptions. The outer circle buildings house many nice restaurants, some with rooftop seating, and shops. We had a late lunch / early dinner at Flavors. Higly recommended. If you are near this stupa and want to buy prayer flags and other buddhist religious souvenir items againts very cheap, fixed local prices, go from the stupa back to the main street Gangalal Way, outside the stuppa east gate turn right (south), after 300 meter, opposite the highly recommended Tibet International Hotel, you will find Yolmo Prayer Flags & Handicrafts."

Definitely recommend going early morning then joining the devout Tibetan Buddhists in their breakfast of flat bread and salty tea at nearby food stalls, no hawkers at this time of the morning either."

My review is particularly about comparing the photographic opportunities between Boudhanath and Swayumbunath.The two main stupas in the Kathmandu Valley are both about the same size and significance, but have completely different surroundings. Swayumbunath is the more \"natural\" on a hilltop ridge, surrounded by an array of minor stupas and other shines, and with a fantastic view out over the entire city. You gradually climb up to the stupa complex. It is significantly less commercialised than Boudhanath.Boudhanath on the other hand, is on the opposite side of the valley, in a built up urban area. You don't see the stupa as you approach it by car. The stupa itself is of a similar size to the one at Swayumbunath, but is completely surrounded by a ring of souvenir shops, cafes and multistory buildings with rooftop restaurants and the area directly around the stupa itself is much clearer and open. The multitude of rooftop cafes and viewpoints, gives a much better opportunity to take panoramic and uninterrupted photos of the stupa than is possible at Swayumbunath. The emphasis is much more on looking in at the stupa, with no opportunity for expansive views of the city. There is significantly more commercialisation and \"shopping\" at Boudhanath.Both are a fantastic visit however, and their surroundings are so different that I urge you to visit both. I recommend Swayumbunath in the morning or dusk when the air is clear, and Boudhanath at any time.For what it is worth, as Swayumbunath is on a hilltop ridge surrounded by trees, there are significantly more monkeys than I have ever seen at Boudhanath."

There is an interesting legend about this building, in ancient times a pious lady wanted to build a holy building so she went to the Rajah and asked him to donate some land for it, the Rajah told her to take one leather hide and spread it out on the land she liked and as much land the hide covered would be hers for the construction of the Stupa. The lady took prayed, then stretched one hide as much as she could and then started cutting small pieces out of it. She took all these pieces to this place she liked and started spreading them around.Thus it took a great effort and a small miracle to cover the entire land that now lies beneath the Stupa. The Raja was so impressed that he gave her the possession of the land at once. The monasteries around the Stupa are a must see. While the Stupa itself is stark and white these are colourful and vivid. There are huge praying cylinders in them. Seeing the monks and the Tibetan people was a real treat."

The air was filled with music & song, and I soon found myself entranced with the crowds & Buddhists circling the Stupa. Because the Stupa is in an enclosed area (albeit a large area), you soon forget about the city outside & become a part of the moment here.There are many souvenir shops, but I didn't visit any. I did however visit the Buddhist Painting School, and encourage you to do the same. You can see young artists painting, and of course, purchase your own to take home. These paintings are amazing & I'm glad I brought one home as a unique souvenir.I think this is one place I could sit at a cafe and just people watch all day long without tiring..."

The Great Stupa in Boudhanath (or Boudha) is located approximately 6-7 km from centre of Kathmandu, so the easiest way is to take a taxi - you shouldn't be paying more than 350-400 NPR. This is one of these places not to be missed during your trip to Kathmandu Valley.This is one of the oldest, most important and spectacular Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the world. I would say this is as well great place to relax from crazy capital and chaos on the roads. There is entry fee of 150 NPR (aprrox. 1,35 EUR) and this ticket is valid for one day. You will receive as well brochure in English with short description of this monumental site. Just to have an idea, how big is that stupa - 1 hec in width and 43 meter in height. Built on a plan of mandala and form of a double lotus. Do not forget your sun-glasses as white colour reflects sun really strong. My advice is to take your time and do not rush. This is place to clear your mind and rest for 2-3 hours... And visit Boudhanath min. 2 times during your stay in the area - morning and evening experiences and views are completely different.Around the stupa there are many shops and local restaurants run mostly by Tibetan refugees (arrived there after Chinese invasion in the 60s). It is worth to enter many of them and search for original and unique (or just better value) souvenirs and gifts. I found it more enjoyable than in Thamel where everybody almost forces you to buy - here you can take your time and find your own 'thing'. Do not miss monasteries on your way as they are really stunning and offers you great panoramic view of the Great Stupa!"

I first visited this place in May 1998 and then once again last year. The impressions I carried with me from my first visit remained deeply engrained in me and brought me back. To witness the Tibetans monks and lay people praying there, circumambulating the stupa with deep dignity and amazing faith is an experience in itself. The beautiful colours of the prayer flags against the pristine white of the stupa is an image difficult to erase from the mind. This place is lively yet calm and time seems to stand still once you are there. I can easily spend a whole day there, eat in the restuarants, shop for interesting trinkets, consult a tibetan medicine practioner and visit the various monasteries around the place. The taxi-ride to the place and the entrance fee feels like money well-spent for trading some wondeful experiences."

We found 5pm to be the best time although also the busiest. It is worth going inside the walls and walking on the stupa itself which is decorated with bright coloured flags.The stupa is surrounded by a number of shops which like the stupa form a circle that surrounds the stupa itself. Alot of the shops sell magnificent but expensive bronze pieces and you can have fun viewing. On the top floor of many of these shops after a climb up very steep steps are a number of cafe's all who have roof gardens who have perfect views of the stupa, which is best viewed while drinking a bottle of the local Everest beer which is surprisingly tasty.

Bodinath is an excellent place to while away hours observing the passing parade.The Stupa itself is one of the largest you may ever get to see, and certainly the largest in Nepal. Many believers travel great distance to pray there. A pilgrimage, if you allow.It is an important religious site for the Buddhist, but to any other religion as well. If only for the significance it has as a place of peace, tranquility and introspection.The site is reached easily from anywhere in Kathmandu Valley as it is on the Ring Road.I'd estimate it's about 5km East of Kathmandu's center (typically considered the Palace itself.) Once you arrive there's a small fee to be paid at the entrance (sometimes they'd just wave me through with a big smile.) Surrounding the Stupa itself is a ring (all the way 'round) of shops and services. Everything you've been seeing elsewhere in Kathmandu; curios, souvenirs, handicrafts, woven items, sculptures, thangkas, metal objects and everything else.It's a good place to 'shop', but it's a better place to spend the day than rupees.Bring a camera, take lots of photos. As the day goes by, you get all kinds of lighting conditions; all of which compliment one aspect or another of the structure itself.*I like to engage my photo subjects if I can, and possibly obtain a mail address for them so I can send them a copy of the picture I've taken. Tourists, after all, 'take' a lot of pictures but rarely 'give' them back. (Try it, it's fun.)There are -at least- three levels of things along the outer ring around the Stupa.Many great places to eat are hidden away in those layers. Great place to explore and discover things. Try it- lots of fun!If you get lucky, you may find a restaurant with an outdoor patio looking down on the open circuit around the Stupa. Excellent vantage point.It should go without saying (but I'll do it anyway)- if you're there during any of the many Holidays they celebrate in Nepal- Bodinath Stupa is a place to see great ceremonies."

            "review": "Interesting Cultural Site. We visited the Boudhanath Stupa after our visit, in the morning, to Pashupatinath Temple. Expect to pay Rs 300 for a taxi ride between the two sites. While Boudhanath Temple is certainly fascinating, I do not believe it deserves the current number 2 ranking on TripAdvisor. If you have visited Tibet you will be disappointed in this stupa, and by Kathmandu generally. We did, however, enjoy our walk around and on the stupa and managed to get some good photo's. Following a tiring morning we enjoyed lunch at one of the caf\u00e9s overlooking the stupa \u2013 that is most enjoyable and well worth the effort. Also there are many tourist shops around the stupa selling items that you can obtain most places around Nepal. Overall it was worth the visit, and worth the Rs 150 (around USD 2) entry fee per person.(NOTE: There seems to be a duplication on TripAdvisor with respect to the same place \u2013 Boudhanath (currently ranked number 2 on TripAdvisor) is the same, as far as I can tell, as Bodnath Stupa (currently ranked 5 on TripAdvisor)."

Interesting in it's own right, there isn't actually that much more to it than what you see. It is a solid structure, so there is nowhere to go inside it. You walk around, look at it and it is completely surrounded by shops selling TTT = typical tourist tat. There are two temples off to the side with some intersting features. One devoted to the Delhi Lama. Entrance fee is 200 Rupes."

            "review": "An almost inside visit to tibet!. The Boudhnath stupa is an extremely enriching experience. The moment one enters, we feel the spirituality of buddhism. The lama's wandering in the premises and the preaching of the dalai lama playing on the cd's......A good guide is very important here without which the trip is meaningless.The only drawback here is that they have commercialised the area to sell souvenirs etc. Tibetan arts and goods was what this area was originally meant to sell but now its mostly the same overpriced souvenir shops that we see at the tourist attractions. Another thing is that the area has a controlled entrance but one can easily enter and depart from the bylanes of the stupa which has no entry/exit barriers. Entry fees are 200 for all foreigners except members of SAARC and 40 Nepali Rupees for SAARC country citizens."

I went to the Stupa with my wife it is impressive to see from a distance, also to walk around it... its really something, so a must in case you want to visit Kathmandu, but in all honesty after making some pictures, unless you love moving from one touristic shop or small restaurant to the other, there isn't that much to see and you'll be out in less than an hour.That said It is one of the sights you should visit in Kathmandu, despite the fact that your out in less than an hour."

Went to check the place out because it was so highly rates here ... and while the place was interesting to visit, I found it a little smelly (like most Nepal's religious sites) and there were just too many stray dogs roaming around for my peace of mind. Overall, the Stupa is beautiful, the locale has many shops for tourists, hotels and restaurants, nice Monastaries to check out and also from some points it looks like a quaint European village ... so very interesting ...!!!"

If you need to shop for local souvenirs, the shops inside the site would be a good start. They might be a bit more expensive than outside but these shops are usually more reliable. So if you are shopping for more expensive items it is a good idea to check here first. There are coffee shops around the Stupa and their roofs would provide you with a good view. WiFi is usually available in the bigger coffee shops too.One important thing, please always try to go around a stupa clockwise. Although this is only a Buddhism ritual but it is always a good idea to respect local tradition - plus you'll get good luck blessing doing so!"

Boudha, one of two major Buddhist enclaves in Kathmandu, is endlessly fascinating, with people of all ages circumnavigating the world-famous stupa in a clockwise fashion. Dawn and dusk are the busiest times with a constant river of human traffic in colorful clothes. Smiling amah-las (grannies) give candy to pouty children, Bells clang, monks chant, kids play soccer with a plastic bottle. These sounds drift in and out as you circle the stupa. The smell of incense fills the air, the prayer flags flap in the wind, the prayer wheels spin.This is a world class spot to people watch."

Big wooden building - big airy wooden treatment rooms. Gentle music in background. Professional people giving the treatments. I had a Shiatso, 90mins, I think it was less than 1000 Nrps (\u00a310). Found it on our last day - else would have used more!!"

There are tons of prayer wheels at the base of the stupa. You'll smell incense burning everywhere. The stupa is surrounded by houses that contain shops on the bottom floor. There were few beggars and no monkeys."
