It almost qualified as having saved the best to the end!The large and pedestrianized area included a helicopter landing pad nearby and some interesting monuments but the church was the central attraction and proved to be beautiful and inspiring - from the bells high in the tower to the lovely interior. It is very much a Russian church with spectacular ornaments in brick, tile and mosaics - especially those inside that portayed large biblical scenes and the gorgeous marble floors. Named because of Tsar Alexander being mortally wounded nearby in 1881. It is a must see destination!"

Compared to Saint Basil's it's more detailed and being set next to a canal makes even more breathtaking. I suggested walking the entire perimeter. It's beautiful from so many angles. Make sure to get a picture with its reflection from the waterway. Also, as per my usual suggestion...go within the first hour of sunrise for views without people, vendors, and buses. It will be worth it."

It's just a very impressive shell as nothing in it but very much worth a look. TIP*** buy tickets at all venues in SPB - NOT ONLINE via TripAdvisor, Expedia etc as you are ripped off via their sites. I paid 1000 roubles online and when swapped my evoucher for our tickets they were only 250 roubles each. I had spotted this when looking at other places so just bought all other tickets at venues and much cheaper. Only downside to SPB is their trying to rip tourists off."

I was fascinated enough to return, but in truth, it is the totality of the exterior which is the worthwhile experience. Walk around, enjoy the colorfulness of the whole building. You can easily give the interior a miss and miss little. Even the exterior is better enjoyed as a totality, not scrutinized minutely. And, here is two cents more: forget the picture-taking. Everyone else is doing it for you. Simply marvel at the creativity and exuberance. I would not consider this a masterpiece by any means, nor do I find it even beautiful, but it does have an exceptional, rather awe-inspiring quality, well-enhanced by its location. It is so much fun to look at, I think children would be entertained."

He was mortally wounded on March 1, 1881. By a couple of bombs thrown his way. Severally bleeding he was taken the Winter Palace where he died a few hours later. You will find extremely detailed inside amenities. During WW II when many people in Russia were starving due to the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi German military forces, the church was used as a temporary morgue for those who died in combat and from starvation and illness. The church was heavily damaged during the war. After the war, it was used as a warehouse for vegetables, leading to the sardonic name of 'Saviour of Potatoes\". The church contains over 7,500 square meters of mosaics alone. Russian Orthodox is the affiliation."

Have a stroll in the adjacent park before going inside. Get there late - 17h00 or so, to avoid the cues and also see it lit after sundown. The unique exterior decorations are also reflected inside, so well worth going in."

What a feast for your eyes, amazing is not adequate. The inside just as ornate and jammed full of visual treasures. One forgets that most European cities first had canals to transport merchandise/people and this is no different, the church being built beside/on a canal. Definitely worth a visit and how lucky one gets to wind your way through all the touristy souvenir stalls, different animals being paraded around, owls, ferrets, cockatoos, plus the obligatory stand still person on a box.

Unfortunately he did not have a short skirt in his bag on this occasion so we did not go in! There were several other men in shorts sitting outside and as we had seen several churches and cathedrals during our visit to Moscow, we were not particularly worried to miss this one.My advice is to make sure you are wearing the appropriate clothes if you want to visit this cathedral."

While in St. Pete for a week, I visited three times. Rain on the first \u2018dampened\u2019 the experience. The second visit was on Wednesday, and access to the interior was not allowed. Third time the charm, and what charm there is. What I thought was ornate blue painted walls is actually gold gilt, mosaics of lapis lazuli tiles, topaz, lazurite, and other semiprecious stones, none larger than a small fingernail\u2014and that on Trump\u2019s tiny hands\u263a This phenomenal church [make that temple] was constructed between 1883 and 1907 on the site where Emperor Alexander II was fatally wounded in March 1881. Construction was funded by the imperial family. The canal alongside the road on which Emperor Alexander rode when he was wounded by an anarchist\u2019s grenade was narrowed, so that the site where he bled out would be inside the temple. That\u2019s why this building juts onto a spit of land into the canal. The church encompasses the original cobblestone street where Alexander was mortally wounded, which comprises the floor, and is in sharp contrast to the mosaic walls. The Soviets closed the church in 1932, later using it to store potatoes and other goods. Nazis bombed a quarter of Petersburg during WWII, including this iconic building. The cost of reconstruction exceeded a hundred fold of original construction. When in Russia\u2019s original capital city\u2014Venice of the north\u2014this is a must-see site. Though impossible from one side, I counted a dozen domes when walking around the building. That number is significant, possibly representing disciples of Jesus."

The Church was built on the site where Emperor Alexander II was fatally wounded in 1881. The exterior of the church is exquisite and rivals St. Basil's in Moscow. The amount of jewellers' enamel used to cover the five onion domes is mind boggling and hard to believe. Detailing of the church's interior is fantastically intricate and well worth the price of admission. I visited as part of a group and was given a guided tour via an audio system which I found hugely beneficial."

Only four churches in St Petersburg (out of 300) were allowed to continue to function during Soviet times. Currently, the State, once again, is using religion to promote their governance of the people."

This is by far the most beautiful church you will ever see. With a mix of brightly colored domes and gold gilt spires there is nothing like it elsewhere. In 1881 Tsar Alexander II was assassinated on this site by a team of 2 terrorists working together. After a spontaneous memorial sprang up and as a memorial to his father Tsar Alexander lll began construction directly over the spilled blood. The church was largely funded by the royal family. The inside of the church is just as spectacular as the outside with extensive religious mosaics as detailed as any painting and extensive use of gold gilt. Built as a memorial, the church never had a congregation or held regular services and in the 1930's was secularized as a state museum. This is the most must see attraction in St Petersburg."

Tsar Alexander II was planning to marry her. But, he was assassinated suddenly.\u201dThe royal family and private donors raised funds to build a church on the spot of the assassination.

The church is located on the banks of one of the canals, about two blocks in from Nevsky Prospekt, and is really a stunning sight to see as you walk toward it. It's also beautifully decorated on the outside, the usual onion domes and colorful motifs, but beautifully done. We purchased the entry ticket from a machine on site and it could not have been easier. The church is imposing inside, much more so than St. Basil's in Moscow, as it is basically one big room rather than smaller chapels that are in St. Basil's. The iconography is wonderful and it was interesting to see the spot where Tsar Alexander II was shot. The church is a great visit to St. Petersburg and is visually gorgeous with its river setting. That said, try to go at off times. We went at 11 a.m. and it was so full that we didn't get to fully immerse ourselves in all the church has to offer."

Bazaar opens around 9-930am. Pretty gd souvenirs.. All four sides of the church were spectacular especially when the sky is clear.. The interior made out of tiny multicoloured mosaic tiles forming pictures of Jesus saints and Angels. What a sight leaves u staring up and around. Gotta keep ur excitement to urself as its a church afterall so volume are to be kept as Low as possible:)Enjoy the sight!"

This is a Cathedral that is stunningly beatiful when seen from the outside, and it is worth going around it - each different viewpoint will reveal something else.But it is after you get inside that your knees shake and you jaw drops. Rich mosaics and icons capture the visitor eye, and the dominant gold and blue colors provide an unforgetable experience. The iconostasis is quite different from what I have seen in other orthodox churches - what it lacks in number of icons it makes up by the sheer richess of the door.Make sure to visit during the day because the sunlight filtering through the windows is an essential part of the visuals. And go back at night to see the exterior of the church illuminated against the night sky."

Fortunately, my pockets are buttoned closed and I was holding my camera at the time. I was able to swing the camera and hit one of them and then a women behind me started screaming so they took off.

It is so beautifully decorated inside and out and has a wonderful story to go with it. The Tsar was killed here and his son built the church in his memory. It's not filled with all the gold leaf you see so much of in other tourist stops. We did it as part of a two day tour, but it is really not to be miss. I loved it"

The inside is fascinating in it different depictions of saints and biblical stories but unfortunately the audio guide is very useless. The audioguide points out that yes, Tsar Alexander II was murdered here, so his son, Alexander III built him this memorial church which was never actually used for services. And then it continues with 'We took these materials from Finland/Ukraine/elswhere and we built this part of the church with them.' which I find highly uninteresting. I would have loved to hear either more about the two tsars OR maybe have better explanations of the wall mosaics. Yes, the guide tells you that the decorations show the life of Christ from his nativity to his death and it mentions that somewhere the tsar's story is told, too. I can spot the nativity scene, of course, and other biblical illustrations. But I couldn't see the tsar anywhere unless he was depicted with a halo?! It would have been so interesting to be able to find out more about who is depicted where and why they are depicted like this. Opposed to what the materials are with which they are depicted...Also, as I mentioned the church felt very spiritually empty to me. It had all this grandeur and all this gold and religious icons but in the end it felt very meaningless to be, very unspiritual. I usually like to withdraw in churches and say a little prayer but this church was very uninspiring...so go inside to take photographs but save money on the audioguide!You are allowed to take photos inside but not while using a tripod."

Just spend 15 mins around this place and walk by the canal near by around sunset makes it romantic even and by the sunset time when you look towards the West you'll see a dreamy view."

Add to this that it was created at a time when the rich were seriously rich and the poor extremely so, and you begin to understand why there was a revolution in the country.These days the church is packed with visitors every minute that it is open, but beware it's also a pickpockets' paradise as well; one member of our group had her passport nicked as she was entering the church. Be careful and enjoy."

The mosaic floors are excellent, and cover most of the floors of this medium sized church. If you can avoid the tourists, you can get some nice exterior photos on sunny days (rare in St Petersburg)."

This church was built on the site where Tsar Alexander II was assassinated.This is not a good choice for anyone with mobility issues. There is a a series of steps outside and no handicapped access. This is also a HUGE site for pickpockets. Keep your passports and large bills under your clothes."

This was the final stop on our trip to St. Petersburg and I couldn't have thought of a better experience than our tour of the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. The outside is amazing. The inside is just as beautiful. It's smaller than you think, but beautiful none the less. One interesting note, you can find a rare painting of a 10-12 year old Jesus Christ inside the Church. Take your time walking around inside, soak it in because it's absolutely beautiful."

Not only is the intricacy of the mosaic-work impressive, but the images themselves are very beautiful. The artwork is laid out so that certain scenes mirror or relate to nearby ones, or juxtapose those opposite them. We were floored by the design, the images, the light, and the beauty. The history of the cathedral itself is interesting with regard to the assassination of the Tsar, the destruction during WWII, the restoration, etc. In a city of over-the-top sights, this is both impressive and overwhelming, but still powerful and in a way, personal."

The tsar, so the story goes, was prepared to steer Russia to a constitutional monarchy and actually had a copy of the new constitution in his pocket. We'll never know what would have happened as he was killed by a group of assassins, who also killed several other people along with him.Alexander's grieving royal family built this magnificent church on the spot where the attack occurred.The church is situated along several sight lines, so it's very dramatic and hard to miss. If you don't like a particular view due to wires or vendor stalls (which can often be the case), either walk around for a different view or come at an earlier time as it is dramatic in many directions.One thing you may note is that the church is in a more Russian Byzantine style than in the western style that typifies much of the architecture in this city. Tsar Alexander III, the son of the slain ruler, was trying to get back more to Russia's roots.The interior of the church was looted during the revolution and largely ruined. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the church has been extensively and beautifully renovated.Please note that most of the artwork is not painted, but, rather, consists of fine mosaics. It is one of the contenders for the largest collections of mosaics in the world.This is now a popular attraction. Although crowded, most of the art is in the form of mosaics in the walls and ceilings, so the crowds won't obscure your views. The area around the church is also very popular, but if you want a nice empty view, just come in the early morning before all the tourists and vendors arrive.This is one of those must-see attractions in St. Petersburg and one you should enjoy."

The intricately detailed mosaics depict biblical scenes and figures, with fine patterned borders setting off each picture. These mosaics were designed and created by the most prominent Russian artists of that time.

Tsar Alexander was a reformer/liberator who abolishes Russia's serfs system in 1861-liberated peasants bound to their landlords. This reform and others substantially offended landlords and nobility hurting their wallets and privilege. 20 years later, onMarch 13, 1881, as Tsar Alexander's carriage passed along the bank, two concessive grenades thrown by anarchist conspirators exploded and kill the Tsar.

He freed the serfs from their virtual enslavement which perhaps explains why this church could be built almost entirely from donations by the people. The irony is that after it was finished, only the nobility were allowed to worship inside, the masses had to stand outside. It was never a church in the usual sense, the only services held were to commemorate Alexander.The gold, green, blue and yellow colours on the domes are what attract the eye but there are colours elsewhere on the building too. Our guide Xenia described the architectural style as Orthodox fused with Art Nouveau, and told us it was damaged after the Revolution in 1919. It was shut down in the 1930's when the Bolsheviks destroyed many churches throughout Russia and instead was used firstly for storing vegetables and then, during the Siege of Leningrad, as a morgue. After the war it was closed for many years due to extensive renovations and was opened again in 1997.This is a very popular tourist attraction and both inside and outside it was a scrum. It was difficult to fully appreciate anything very much inside because of the number of people. I found it impossible to think of it as a church at all, but could admire the over 7000 square meters of mosaics that completely cover the walls and ceiling. There is a small exhibition of some atrefacts and details of the renovation. It does seem a little gloomy inside as it is lit from natural light."

All 6,560 m\u00b2, comprising 308 illustrations are mosaics. It took 24 years to build, only being consecrated in 1907 under Nicholas 2. The Bell Tower is built over the actual spot that Alexander 2 had his legs blown off in an assassination attempt. Naturally, he died soon after. The irony is that he was alighting from his carriage to thank members of his Cossack Guard who had earlier saved him from an assassination attempt. However, as he was driving along the edge of the Catherine Canal, it has meant that to put the Bell Tower over the actual spot, the Church juts out into the Canal itself so you cannot walk around it.Next to the Church are the Mikhailovskiy Gardens, a beautiful oasis in the middle of the city, and also the loveliest way to get to the Russian Museum.Most people approach the church from Nevsky Prospekt, past the souvenir sellers, mostly selling the same stuff, but you can also buy original artworks here at reasonable prices.Around the church you'll also find buskers, people wandering around with animals you can pose with for a price - when I was there, these includes pigeons, owls, and a gorgeous raccoon - and portrait makers. Walk around all of them and see what work they are currently doing, as the artwork they sit behind is not always theirs. We found one artist that we had to queue for but he was well worth the wait.On a sunny day, with live music playing, and this singularly gorgeous building above you, there are few places on the planet more pleasant to just chill out at."

It costs 250 Rubels pp but only takes 50, 100 and 500 Rubel notes. Once inside, get an audio guide ticket from the machine (100 Rubles, and again only takes 500 or less notes.) Then take the ticket to the booth next door to get the Audio guide. We didn\u2019t have any 500 Rubel notes, so had to do without.This cathedral is amazing on the inside. Absolutely beautiful frescos and paintings on the walls and ceiling, a wonderful alter door at the front, making anything that Liberace might have owned look positively tasteful but cheap. This altar door is the King of Bling!At the back of the church is a gazebo marking the spot where Alex II was assassinated.When we were outside the church, I heard an American tourist exclaim how this church was the most beautiful thing she had ever see. As they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Yes, it is fantastic, but beautiful? For me, no way.It is ugly \u2013 looks like an acid eating architect designed a series of fantasy flavoured ice cream cones piled on top of a red brick industrial complex, with some brightly coloured mosaics glued on the side, and sprinkled liberally with confetti or hundreds and thousands \u2013 ok ok, I am exaggerating. But I think you get the idea \u2013 it is, in my opinion, the height of gaudy bad taste.Still, worth seeing? Yes. You wont see anything like this anywhere in the world - it even shames St. Basel's in Red Sq. And 4 bux to enter - it is 100% worth the money."

Seen from Nevsky Prospekt the multi-coloured domes will draw you past all of the souvenir stalls until you look up in awe at the amazing architecture.To visit this museum (and that is what it now is) the tickets can be bought from the other side of the building. Beware, it is shut on Wednesdays like many other SPB sights. Once inside you will be stunned by the gold and blueness of the walls with nearly every inch covered in mosaics, over 7500 square metres of them. While you will find the space usually crowded with other visitors it should not spoil your enjoyment because most of the mosaics are above head hight and therefore easily viewed."

Ornately decorated multi-colored onion domes, the Church intentionally looks like St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. The moment you walk in , the sheer beauty of the place overwhelms you. Words simply cannot describe the magnificence. Every square inch is covered in painting, the vast majority incredibly detailed mosaics, or gold. Over 24,600 feet of mosaic. The blood refers to Tsar Alexander 11, who was killed on the site in 1881. The extravagant shrine was constructed on the actual spot where Alexander was fatally wounded. In a city where Western architecture predominates, this distinctly Russian-style church stands out, yet blends in. I love it!"

Don't let the crowds deter you. They are there for a reason. This is a fantastic experience. Inside, it will be very crowded but most of the glorious colour and atmosphere is above you so just join the queue, go in and gaze upwards at the columns and the dome.Before you leave, pay your respects to Alexander ll, Russia's last reforming Emperor.

The name is officially \u201cChurch of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ\u201d, but it is better known as the \u201cChurch of the Spilled Blood\u201d on where Alexander II was fatally wounded and his blood spilled. There is a shrine inside the church covers the exact spot. It was built in the neo-Russian style (16th and 17th Century Russian) contrasting to surrounding Baroque, Classical architecture. It took 24 years to build (1883 \u2013 1907, started from Alexander III) and 27 years to restore (1970 \u2013 1997) after being badly damaged and looted by 1917 Russian Revolution and WWII. Hard to believe, it was one time used as food storage and morgue. There is no painting in the church but all made of tiny mosaics (> 6500 square meters). There is couple more symbolic facts, (1) the highest point is 81 meter (commemorate year of death, 1881) (2) the second highest cupola is 63 m (age of death). To be able to see the church as it is today, it is truly amazing. This is one of the most iconic recognizable structures in St. Petersburg if not in the world. Everyone must come."

It was worth every cent of admission and just filled with one beautiful thing after another! The mosaics are incredible. The walls, canopy and floors are breath-taking. Do not miss this church, even if you do not like churches!"

We decided to walk over to it (not too far from our hotel) on our free time. The inside is absolutely stunning - the mosaics cover the walls and ceiling and the floor design is outstanding. I spent a long time leaning against a pillar so I could more easily relish the ceiling and higher parts of the walls. It is a non-operating church and was closed in 1932 during the \"Soviet Era\"; it was used for storage and eventually for the sets of an opera company. It was painstakingly restored over a period of 27 years and there is an interesting exhibit showing before and after pictures towards the exit. I highly recommend visiting this church - it was the best - inside and out - of all the many ones I saw throughout Russia."

We were told that for many years, under the Soviet government, the building was not used as a Church - at one point, potatoes were stored inside the building! It also suffered tremendous damage during the 900 Day Siege of Leningrad during WWII. The painstaking reconstruction of this remarkable edifice was impressive to say the least.

The outside is stunning, decorated in what is broadly seen as a typically Russian style. There are several religious representations in mosaics around the outside of the church. And the inside of the church continues with this; virtually every surface is completely covered in mosaics depicting religious scenes or figures. The colours are rich and vibrant, and the overall impression is very strong. Its Christian heritage is very clear. And the spot where the Emperor was assassinated while at prayer, and his blood spilled, is clearly marked. It is worth reading up about this church before you visit it."

And then there is the inside - heavily decorated with murals made of the tiniest mosaics - it just takes the breath away.The place is tourist heaven so it will be busy most times - more so I believe in August when St Petersburg is even busier than it was during our June visitYou really need an informed guide to get the most from your visit here. We had an amazing guide from Alla Tours who informed us i.a. that the Church is still used for services. There are no traditional pews though as the Russian custom is to stand for the entire service so getting around the cavernous interior isn't as bad as it might otherwise be. If you aren't part of a tour group, just attach yourself to one of the numerous groups visiting the Church - no-one would notice or probably mind if they did!"

I would definitely recommend visiting the Church on Spilled Blood as we enjoyed it very much. There is also an option to take an audioguide,but the audioguide that we took at St Isaac's cathedral was of a very poor quality so we read some information on wikipedia in order to fully appreciate the history and the architecture of the church.

Visiting the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood was the finale to an excursion from my cruise ship M/V Magellan, The lead up to the visit was a trip on the waterways around parts of this \"Venice of the North\".There is so much to see in St Petersburg and trying to see everything in the two days we would be impossible, so I made the executive decision that seeing as much as possible from the outside would be the way to go for me.The trip on the waterways gave me an amazing view of the architecture that lined the route taken by the boat, enabling me to take many pictures.I did find afterwards, a book in English in one of the two souvenir shop (ship side of Immigration) that showed by map and pictures with description what the waterway traveller was seeing, so that supplements my photographs.As I said earlier, the visit to the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood was the last spot on this excursion and access was very strictly controlled. The Church was a beautiful example of Russian Architecture and once inside you are overwhelmed by the painting adorning almost every surface of the walls and ceilings.Unfortunately our visit was on a Sunday, so the church was packed. We were guided around the inside walls, but the best place to see and appreciate was the middle of the floor space.Our guide had issued our coach with headset receivers so we were able to hear her description (as long as you could see the identifying paddle you knew where to look).The guide called the paintings \"icons\", though in my simple view they were \"murals\" - but they were amazing.There are no stairways or steep slopes to hinder those with mobility problems, though the crush of people experienced on this Sunday visit could cause some a problem.Entry to the Church was by the front of the building, but the Exit was around the back. There was a walk around 3/4 of the Church to get back to where the coaches parked.Was it worth visiting? A resounding yes.If you travel independently, you will need to obtain a Visa before you arrive in Russia. As part of an organised excursion (whether organised through the Cruise Ship or via an Approved Excursion), you are covered by a Group Visa."

Going into the church we were told no photos but they actually meant no flash ;-) What a joy. I've never seen a church like it... it's beautiful. Definitely definitely try and visit if you have the time - it's well worth it."

My son and I did some quick math to conclude roughly 600 mosaic tiles per square foot - for a total of 42,000,000 in the building. More amazingly, they accidentally found an unexploded bomb lodged in the cupola of the structure during restoration - IN 1961! It sat for almost two decades before being discovered. Even more amazing is the Bolshevik's were due to destroy the church because it represented faith at a time where that was punished. They even announced the date it was due to be destroyed to break the will of the \"believers.\" It was June 22, 1941. You guessed it, Germany invaded Russia early that morning.How many times can the Church of Spilled Blood avoid annihilation? Miracles?"

It almost defies belief how ( not to mention why) they Soviets accomplished this feat and not surprising that it took 25-30 years. I'm not going to ruin it for you by droning on about the details, but this place left us with the same impression I had after an afternoon at Our Lady of the Rocks in the Bay of Kotor. If you visit St. Petersburg and see only three places, it would be here, the Hermitage and Peterhof. Happy Trails."

The light was not at its best due to drizzle, but is was still amazing. It was just closing so we went back later to go inside. The best view we had of the Church was from the war memorial park with the eternal flame.We did not spend long inside the Church as it was very crowded, the mosaics are wonderful. You can get a really good picture of the central roof by laying your camera on the ground on timer, you can be in the shot yourself. After my husband did this there were groups using his technique to get a shot of the roof with themselves looking down."

I made my way from Nevsky Prospect past the four-block gauntlet of stands selling cheap (but not inexpensive) souvenirs along the Griboedova Canal to get a look at the Church of the Savior on the Spilled Blood, erected on the site where Czar Alexander II, who was something of a progressive (for example, he ended serfdom), was shot in his carriage. This was the third attempt on his life, and it was successful; although he didn\u2019t die immediately, he later succumbed to his wounds. The usual young couple in 18th Century costumes posed for photos with tourists. A young man walked around with a baby raccoon on his shoulder. A fairly good musician played an electric guitar and sang rock and roll. But the closer I got, the worse the church looked. Except for the one that was gilded, the domes appeared to have been constructed of cheap materials, almost like a stage set; and the entire fa\u00e7ade, with its Gothic Revival arches, Romanesque columns and faux Byzantine icons, was an ostentatious hodge-podge. I didn\u2019t bother buying a ticket to see the interior. Given the herded hoards exiting tour buses, I figured I could see all I wanted (and perhaps more) online."

It would have been cheaper to get a visa a month in advance and then get off the ship two days running. Can I also add that the cruise line does not inform you that there is a red hop on and off bus which takes you to all of the tourist sites and is a fraction of the cost of the ship tours, If we had been more savy and organised our visa we could have got off the ship for the two days, however due to the expense remained on board for one of the days as you can not get through customs.However onto the church, magnificent place, but the single ticket at the kiosk or you end up paying entry to all of the churches, not much difference in price and we retained the ticket as a souvenir. Beautifully decorated, lots of azure blue/gold. Very touristy outside, beware people with baby racoons trying to take photos and charging high prices, cute racoons but sure as soon as they get big enough they will be made into the fur hats been sold opposite the photographers,"

The weather was delightful and clear. The church is built alongside the Catherine Canal. The \"spilled blood\" referenced in the name of the church is that of Tsar Alexander II who was critically injured when, on March 1, 1881, a bomb went off near him and he fell at the exact spot where the church was later built. He was taken to a hospital where he died within a matter of hours. In his honor, this church was built on the spot where he fell. The outside of the church is magnificent with its multi-colored onion domes and gold gilded onion domes, with a mural on the outside of the church. The multi-color domes are enameled paint with many different shapes of wood on the domes. Inside the Russian Orthodox church there is a canopy of the site of the mortal wounding of Emperor Alexander II. Inside there are also numerous murals on the walls, in the domes and on the ceilings of the church. The outside is more impressive than the inside but the inside is worth seeing. The cost to go inside the church is 250 rubles."

Note that entry door is just to the right as you face the ticket booth. Don't follow the crowds to the left...they are going to the garden or shopping street behind. As for the many shopping booths the guidebook says are behind the Church...yes there are many. But each has pretty much the same tourist stuff. Not likely to be worth your time. Though a walk down this street/canal is pleasant. Easy to see on your own. No tour needed."

The intricate mosaic artistry of the interior is spectacular and the detailing in the exterior architecture is captivating. For these reasons the church is worth visiting. When we visited, however, the church was extreme overcrowded inside. We could barely move. Our unhappiness over this issue was made more acute by the fact that the entrance fee, in our opinion, was high. Personally, I also didn't like the commercialism of selling cheap trinkets actually inside the church, and I was left wondering if this beautiful church had been reduced to a money-making venture."

I barely thought that we wouldn't see some churches or cathedrals of typical russian medieval orthodox architecture in St.Petersburg as we had seen in Moscow, when reality pleasantly confuted me. Here,almost at the confluence of the canal Gryboedov in the river Moyka, on the canal right embankment, emerges literally as from the depths of the earth, miraculous edifice, that is, the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. That is one of the main sights of St.Petersburg. It was built on the site where Emperor Alexander II was fatally wounded in 1881. From this fact derives the name of this wondrous structure, I may say, the chef d'oeuvre of human craftsmanship. Construction of the church lasted during the reigns of Alexander III and Nicholas II.Completely picturesque creation, either outside or inside. Full of decorated windows with winding lines, little columns on the facade, colourful roofs with the onion domes on the top, arched gilded doors, some little gates and so many other wonderful shapes. And when we entered inside, there awaited us equally magic sights. Especially are distinctive the numerous mosaics and very rich iconostasis.Also are presented some paintings of the most celebrated Russian artists such as Viktor Vasnetsov, Mikhail Nesterov and Mikhail Vrubel.Again, as so many times before in Russia, we were staggered beyond all expectations."

Striking exterior, with so many photo ops for even the most casual photographer. Gorgeous coloration and detail to the exterior. Inside, virtually every wall and ceiling space is decorated with mosaics, with gold and other bright colors. The actual floorspace is not that large (by cathedral standards), emphasizing the vertical feeling within the interior. It was very crowded, with both individuals and tour groups, when we were there. You can spend as much or as little time as you want here, so I can imagine a visit of as little as 20-30 minutes, up to several hours, and any length in-between, so don't hesitate to go even if you don't have that much time."

Do some research on the church before coming here as you will appreciate the art work more. Inside is huge and it can get crowed when cruise people are visiting. Get your camera ready take as many pictures as possible. Take outside pictures from the exit side of the church as there'll be less people. When you exit, look for the entrance to a park. Yes, there is a park next to the church. If you have time, take a stroll in the park as it is nice and cool during the summer. You can buy ice cream or drinks and enjoy them in the park. It is very relaxing. Buy souvenirs from the exit side. You'll run into many souvenir stands. Be prepared to bargain. DO NOT pay the full price. Anywhere between 20% to 40% discount is good."

One never ceases to be amazed at the craftsmanship and time invested in these sacrificial works of art and praise. HINT: upon exiting - walk about 100 feet out the door to the water color artist who is basically a resident according to our guide. Our crew literally bought out his works. They are not fakes. He is the artist and will autograph his work for you. They are inexplicably affordable and one of a kind pieces."

But it was worth every painful step to get there! Don't miss it!"

After seeing the Hermitage and so many other amazing buildings, the outside of the Church on the Spilled Blood is so colourful that part of you thinks the best part must be the exterior...until you go inside and are absolutely overwhelmed with the richness, the colour...it's actually hard to focus on any one thing.

The columns are shaping an integral part of the city's central panorama over the river, Neva River.There are a lot of high-speed boats (Hydrofoils) running on the Neva River. Hydrofoil runs from St. Petersburg to Peterhof and these tour boats are referred as \"Meteors\". I didn't try them out, unfortunately. However. Next time could be pleasure ride.

The exterior this church uses imagery to compare the life of Alexander II to that of Christ. The interior was built around the actual site of the attack. The artistry is remarkable and has mostly endured the depredations of the Bolsheviks intact, including being used as a morgue and a vegetable warehouse. The altar doors have been reconstructed.I appreciated the audio guide, especially for the specifics on how different mosaics were created. To an artist, that\u2019s fascinating."

Facebook reminded me of my memories and I'm her again. Still I can remember the first moment I entered the building. It was like \"Oh my God!\". Those paintings purely made of mosaics art was fantastic. It's too bad that I am trying to find that feeling in my further trips but it seems impossible. It feels so divine. You must visit this church even if you have only one day in St.Petersburg."

A large sign across the booth to that effect might have saved some of her frustrations. The street vendors are still out in force, even when the church is closed and you can always buy a Putin, Stalin, Obama or Mao doll in true Babushka style instead!

It's incredible how much work and effort people have put on building it. I really liked the fact that they have left the place where the Emperor Alexander was fatally wounded visible, so you can actually see a piece of the street in there. The church is not too big so you dont need a lot of time to go around but there's a lot of mosaic art to look at and a lot of turist groups that might slow you down. You can get an audio guide from the info for only 100rubles if youre interested."

A few years ago this church has been completely restored and has to be considered one of the most spectacular form of iconography in mosaics in the world. The examples of mosaics left in Ravenna, Istanbul and Greece among others from the Byzantine Empire are spectacular but only partial due to damage over the centuries. This church is not only completely finished in the interior but the exterior as well. From the Pantocrator under the central dome and Theotokos (Mother of God) at the apse this church iconography is completely following the Painters manual used throughout the ages. Most spectacular is the Annunciation at the Royal Doors. My suggestion if you take a tour stay after and slowly make a second trip throughout the church."

I'm definitely not an art or church historian but it's a shock to see the depictions of classical and biblical scenes adorning every square inch of the church. To view it at length requires serious dexterity in one's neck! It's interesting to note that it was, of course, closed during the Soviet Era and was used as a storage facility. Just cleaning the mosaics and undoing years of neglect required enormous resources. Notwithstanding any historical details, this Church is stunning and its beauty will leave you breathless."

I come here on my annual business trip to SPb, and we inevitably take a walk here and take lots of pictures. It is just plain amazing inside and out. Try catching glimpses of all sides of the outside at different times of the day or year in different weather conditions, and you will notice all sorts of new details each visit. The same can be said about the vast volumes of intricate mosaics inside. It is really hard to capture the majesty of it all in photographs. I think I will capture video next visit to try and outline some of the interior dome and spire mosaics. Like a fine art museum, this place never becomes tiresome. In fact, my appreciation grows with each visit."

Photos do not do it justice \u2013 most visitors were wandering round in silence just taking in the beauty of the building. A special canopy covers the area where the Tsar fell \u2013 this was the 12th attempt on his life and he had just minutes before survived the 11th one. Left to fall into disrepair for many years, and threatened with demolition, the church was thankfully restored and reopened to the public in the 1990s. Definately in the Top Five Places to visit in St Petersburg."

The scale is huge and the craftsmanship impressive. We visited several Orthodox churches on our trip and this was almost certainly our favourite so if you only visit one, this is recommended!When you come out, you are on one of the main canalside streets and there are plenty of nice places to rest weary feet over a coffee or meal."

Also, you can see a lot of mosaics in there, which is nice. It's built in the very tipical Russian style and doesn't really look like it's in St. Petersburg (for me it always kind of feels like it belongs to Moscow).As usual in orthodox churches on the inside there is so much to see, that you can not really decide where to look first.I recommend everybody to go there, also when not that interested in churches, because a visit of Piter whithout this church is just not complete! ;)"

When I first walked towards the monument (it is not a church at all) I literally was awe struck by its immense beauty and balanced architecture. It is such and out worldly structure with all those unique building materials used . Walk from the rear first from the Main Street to get good landscape pictures first before you make your way to the front of the church. As you walk and admire the exterior, be assured that the interior is even more awe inspiring. Entrance is 250 Roubles . Walk inside and enjoy the interior. The paintings are made from mosaics and tiles which are colorful, engaging and meant to make you feel insignificant. A good 30 minutes visit.If feel like buying Russian souvenirs, buy from the vendors outside and do some bargaining . Definitely the first place to visit on the city. Note that it closes on Wednesdays."

But, my feeling about the Russian churches is pretty much that if you have seen one you've seen them all. Probably ignorant, I know, but they do all seem to have the same decorations and iconography.What makes this stand out is that a tsar was assassinated here so the cathedral was renamed to reflect that. If, by the time you get to here, you have been to the Hermitage you may be sufficiently appalled at the blatant awful excesses of the royalty to think that was not necessarily a bad thing.This cathedral reflects those excesses with an extravaganza of gold, gilt and glass, not to mention frescos and mosaics and a totally incongruous shrine to the dead tsar made, of course, with the finest materials and craftsmanship including, no doubt, the blood of virtual slave labour who built it."

Easily accessible by taking the blue line to Nevsky Prospect and exit by ways of the Griboedov Canal. As you walk down the canal, you will pass plenty of vendors selling miscellaneous goods. The outside is very colorful and beautiful, but I would suggest going around to the back and buy tickets to enter into the church. Reasonably priced, you go inside and see what seems like endless mosaics wonderfully crafted out to scenes throughout the Bible. There is also a stone located inside the church that has some blood of deceased Emperor Alexander II, from which the church derived its name."

I either hadn't read the right trip reviews or our media just doesn't report very well on the current culture of Russia. Granted when you travel to Europe ..churches or cathedrals are generally numerous on any given tour but I hadn't expected it in Russia. The Russian Orthodox Church is alive and well in the country and the Church of the Savior of Spilt Blood is impressive. The scenery around the church can be just as interesting as it attracts a number of unique visitors as you will find in other large cities in Europe, perhaps not in as large a numbers as you might find in London or Paris or Madrid. This church has special significance in Russian history and on the day we were on the grounds the crowds were not large but manageable. We were on a fairly tight schedule and were told to be careful about paying to get in and not be able to have enough time but oddly enough the ticket line was not that long and the walk through can take as long or as short an amount of time as you may wish. We didn't go inside but a member of our group that did said it was worth the effort to see the interior."

The first wonder is that the building, somehow, still stands notwithstanding the fact that the Soviets had decided to tear it apart more than once; the first time in 1931, then in 1938 and finally in 1956. The church also survived major damages in World War II. It substantially differs from all other churches in Saint Petersburg, where the architecture is predominantly Baroque and Neoclassical, while the Savior on Blood reminds of the medieval Russian architecture and it intentionally resembles St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral in Moscow.The outside is wonderful, with the side of the church that almost seems to dive into the river as it outline breaks the symmetry of the canal, and the domes, all in different colors, give it a rather unique appearance. The inside is just as nice with tiles in different colors and mosaics. Sure worth a visit."

On the 4th from the Petro Palace Hotel we strolled along the Nevskiy Prospect and arrived at the Church to mostly tour the outside, to see the souvenir merchants and the park in the back. It was a lovely day to walk and see the attractions, the caf\u00e9s, the chic boutiques and the flower arrangements. We took numerous photos of the outside of the Church known for its Russian Revival style. On September 6th as part of an SPB Tour we were able to enter Saviour on Spilt Blood to admire the insides. The insides are a mosaic galore. The walls, the window frames, the ceilings are covered with different types of blue, red and gold mosaic. We were told that the mosaic and ceramic used was jasper, porphyry and Italian marble. Also this church was never actually used for church services, funerals or weddings but rather to the memory of Alexander II. This church is a very inspiring building, monument and work of art and as a result is another five stars in my book."

What I find so wonderful about Russian orthodox churches is the magnificent mural decoration which, set in a warm,carpeted surroundings with chanting, is comforting.A complete and reassuring contrast to the plain and austere Presbyterian kirks in Scotland where I was brought up.The church was raised as a memorial in the place of assasination of Tsar Alexander 2nd and the area where the assasination occurred is roped off within the church.In world war 11 when Leningrad(as it was then known)was besieged the church received a direct hit from a bomb that landed cradled in the outstretched hands of Jesus whose picture is painted in the dome itself.The guide told me that the bomb failed to explode.However this story is not recorded in the guide book I received - it is possible the omission is because the guidebook was written during the soviet era when publicity of apparent miracles would not be encouraged but one can't know for sure.I was told at one time in the soviet era the church was a store and the fine mosaic flooring was badly damaged but that has now been restored in all its grandeur.The foundation was laid in 1883.It includes a bell tower which is interesting because a bell tower to join up with an episcopalion church in Inveraray,Loch Fyne <scotland was also designed albeit not until later around 1921."

Right in the center, at the end of one of St. Petersburg's channels (at the other end is another great Cathedral, Kazan Cathedral), this church is so nice and artistic that you cannot stop making photographs of it. It costs and it is open only till 18:00, a bit inconvenient, as St. Petersburg approaches White Nights, when sun sets after 22:00. More light daily would require longer open hours at the monuments. Unfortunately, most of them close at 18:00."

In the surroundings there are kiosks where you can buy gifts of all sorts although I don't recommend hanging outside the church. It gets crowded and there are a lot of crooks playing the old trick of catching your attention while others get their hands in your belongings. Be alert at all times while you are outside and don't carry anything that can be pulled away from you and if you carry a backpack I recommend to use locks so they can't open it. (I recommend this for every trip everywhere because you never know).These crooks don't seem dangerous but getting you camera or other belongings stolen is not fun.

The Church was built between 1883 and 1907 on the site where Emperor Alexander II was killed by the grenade bombs of 2 anarchists in March 1881. The imperial family paid for its construction, the style of which isn't baroque or neoclassical like the majority of St.Petersburg buildings. It resembles the 17th c.Yaroslav churches and the famous St.Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. The main architect was Alfred Alexandrovich Parland. 7.500 square meters of mosaic icons cover completely the walls, more than any other church in the whole world. The mosaics depict scenes from the Bible and figures of Saints. The colourful marble floor is amazing too. Unfortunately such a unique treasure was badly damaged and looted by the communists after the Russian Revolution. In 1930 it was closed for services. It was used afterwards as a morgue, a warehouse for vegetables (hence the name The Saviour on Potatoes!!!), or for the Small Opera House, etc. It's a miracle that it avoided complete demolition. It was opened again in 1997, after 27 years of restoration. In 2005 the new Holy Gates were designed by V.J.Nikolsky and S.G.Kochetova after old lithographs. Enamel artist L.Solomnikova. Rhodonite, jasper & serpentine gemstones cover the spot, where Emperor Alexander II was murdered, under a canopy, that symbolizes the holiness of the memorial. . The Church is now a Museum of Mosaics, open to the public daily, except Wednesdays, from 11.00' to 18.00'."

This church, which survived WW II with not much damage, made our 2 days in Russia worth the disappointments experienced elsewhere in St. Petersburg. It is a colorful extravaganza of mosaics & flowing lines with domes & roofs simply a riot of bright colors -- in stark contrast to the architecture & streets surrounding it. After our really sad experience at the Hermitage, this church gave us a real boost of enthusiasm & a good memory of St. Petersburg."

There is a bridge nearby, just across from the cathedral,\u00a0 that affords a great vantage point and is just far enough away to get the whole building in your photos!We also had a tour of the inside. The interior mosaics overwhelm you -it was too much in my opinion. Every column is mosaic, as well as the walls and ceiling. The designs in mosaic are lovely and detailed to be sure, along with the altars and other iconography; but for us, other Christ Pantocrator mosaics were more moving when in a less 'busily decorated' interior (Cefalu Cathedral, for example).There is a small area in the floor in the Church on Spilled Blood, that has a wrought iron fence surrounding it.\u00a0 Quite an ornate fence mind you- where you see rocks in the ground, said to be the site of the actual spilled blood. Perhaps the most 'real' spot inside. At least the rocks weren't gilded!It was very crowded when we visited; definitely keep watch on your belongings. Of course there is a gift shop inside too; nothing we really wanted, but if you are looking for souvenirs, it seemed to be a better place to look than the kiosks outside. In addition to various religious mementos they had other items, such as matryoshka dolls.We were with a guide who gave us a lot of narrative, so we were inside for quite a while. We really could have seen enough of it in under half an hour. So, even if you are tight on time, it is worth a short visit to see this famous landmark!"

We visited in a very quite time which allowed us to look through the church, which is one room. Read up about the hosting before you go. Now the BIG issue is what occurs outside the church. If you are approached by a tall man about 25 years old, holding a plastic bag asking you to go to his shop, move away from him immediately. He will show you two calendars and a large Russian doll. He will harras you for about 5 minutes whilst you are walking. He seems very nice and very engaging. Two other men will walk up behind you and open your backpack. They are quick and concise. They will stand very. Lose to you. When you realise that your bag is opened, they will tell you the 'thieves' went down a side street. At this stage they want you to follow the alleged thieves where they will rob you. If you approached at all........walk the other way. Their modus operandi is to steal as much as they can. I realised what had occurred as soon as my bag was opened by the short older man. We did not go down the street as I knew this is what they were trying to do. They hang around the area on the other side of the bridge. As you head towards the hermitage. Unfortunately their are no police around. Though there were three that were following us, there was another male standing nearby. The church is great, do not trust anyone. This tainted our Russia trip."

The adjoining canal was narrowed to enable the exact spot where he died to be incorporated in the building, the design of which harks back to the 17th c.the church was never open for public worship - being used only for memorial services - was looted after the revolution, used as a morgue during the war and as a vegetable store afterwards. In the 1970s a complete restoration was begun and the church reopened as a museum in 1997.

The historical story of how Alexander II (the greatest Russian reformer since Peter the Great) was shot here - by an organization known as \"People's Will\", which may or may not have been by financed by Europe - adds another layer to mysterious Russian Imperial history. The Church was erected by Alexander III in honor of his father, with financial contributions from Russian citizens. Architecturally, the Cathedral differs from St. Petersburg's other structures. The city's architecture is predominantly Baroque and Neoclassical, but the Savior on Blood harks back to medieval Russian architecture in the spirit of romantic nationalism. It intentionally resembles the 17th-century Yaroslavl churches and the celebrated St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow.The Church contains over 7500 square meters of mosaics\u2014according to its restorers, more than any other structure. Like other churches in Russia, it was used for storage during the Soviet Regime, and renovated afterwards. A must see."

This church is a must see if you visit St Petersburg.We came by ship, the P&O Adonia, what a great way to arrive into such a famous city, but the cruise terminal is a good 30 minute coach trip into the city.The church is a perfect example of how you expect Russia to be, the golden onion domes, and fantastic colours, are so typical of the country, and are absolutely exquisite.The church has a fascinating history, and very closely linked to the royal family, it's well worth reading up on the history, so much has taken place here.One thing about this site, it's amazingly busy, thousands flock here everyday, also be very aware of pickpockets and bag snatchers .. It happens very quickly, and they disappear into the crowds.But without doubt, very worth a visit."

It has very distinctive and interesting onion shaped domes which are decorated in beautiful colorful mosaics. Inside it is even more richly decorated with intricately detailed mosaics and gold everywhere. It houses the tombs of both Peter the Great and Catherine and is the most opulently decorated church I have ever seen. It was very crowded as most sights in St Petersburg are in the summer tourist season but large enough to be able to move around."

The crowds were not too bad, and the experience of being inside a truly memorable building like this is not one to be missed."

The beautiful Russian church was build on the spot where Tsar Alexander II was assassinated in March 1881. The section of the street on which the assassination took place is enclosed within the walls of the church and the site of the murder is marked by a chapel in the building. Both the interior and exterior of the church is decorated with incredibly detailed mosaic. The majority of the mosaics depict biblical scenes and saints though some are just patterns. The colorful onion domes, of which the central one reaches a height of 81 meters (266 ft), to reflect the year 1881 of the assassination are covered with bright enamels. The magnificent Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood is one of St. Petersburg's most memorable landmarks."

It is an absolute visual feast and if you're blown away by the exterior, the interior is to be seen to be believed. It's name incidentally is derived from the site on which it is built, the place where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated.. Built with monies provided by the imperial family it's quite different to many of St.Petersburg's baroque style buildings. The cathedral's unique appearance is rather medieval in style, adorned with colourful onion domes and visible from points all over the city. The complete interior is a work of art, mosaics totalling 7500 square metres adorning the walls, ceilings & floors, and designed and constructed by the most famous artists and craftspeople of the day. No longer used for services, today it is a museum. We went as part of a full-day guided tour so the cost was absorbed but I believe tickets are available from 250 roubles. It is very crowded, and pickpockets are a problem so take care to protect your valuables.It really is a magnificent structure, very beautiful and quite breathtaking! A must-see part of anyone's itinerary if you're visiting this amazing city."

He had the camera with a zoom lens cross slung over his shoulder with a Pac Safe camera strap. This is why we still have the camera but not the telephoto lens. It happened really fast while he was photographing he felt someone bump him hard and saw it was a guy in a leather jacket. I was busy taking photos with my i phone and did not notice. He did not think much about it and went on photographing. I finished shooting the angle I wanted and turned to follow him when I saw his waist back pack had been unzipped, both zippers, and was empty. He did not even feel it. I guess we were such an easy hit the guy who had hit him followed us on a ten minute walk to somewhere else. He was wearing a leather jacket on a very warm day so my husband remembered him. We turned on him to confront him and he disappeared. Watch out if you are bumped. It is a set up. I do not think they work alone, So, the church is wonderful inside and out they just need more police protecting the tourists. We did not see any present."

I always thought it looked so colourful.The church has a very interesting story. It was built on the site that tsar Alexander III was wounded in an assassination attempt and later died. He was going along the canal in his carriage and a anti-royal family anarchist threw a bomb under his carriage. He was unhurt. When he got out to confront the man, another bomb was thrown at him and he was severely wounded. The church was funded by private donors (the different areas these donors were from in Russia are represented in the tiles on the exterior of the church) and the state. The church is also spectacular from the interior. It is decorated elaborately with colourful, intricate mosaics. The entrance fee is approximately 300 rubles. It is definitely worth going into to revel in its splendour."

The 16-17th century style building contrasts sharply with the Baroque, classical & more modern surrounding buildings of the area. Some expressive mosaics in the church's interior. Plethora of souvenir stalls at rear of church alongside the canal."

The exterior, thought by some to be garish and utterly without artistic value when first completed, is quintessentially Russian and completely charming. As stunning as the exterior is, however, the interior almost defies description. It seems every inch of available wall and ceiling space is covered with the most intricate and fabulously beautiful of mosaics. I've been blessed to view many churches in numerous countries, but this cathedral is in a class all its own. My initial reaction to these luminous mosaics was, \"This is the most amazing place I've ever been.\" The shrine erected over the spot of Alexander's assassination is especially impressive as well. It's almost impossible to believe that this beautiful edifice fell into disrepair and was used for storage in the post-Revolution years. Our guide shared her memories of the church's restoration during her childhood; those recollections were a poignant reminder of what was almost lost forever. Be prepared for crowds when you visit this peerless cathedral--it is a very popular place. But don't let the crush of humanity keep you away. This church is well worth your time and rubles!"

The mosaic are more than impressive and the colors are resplendisant.In fact, if you only got time to visit one church/cathedral in St.Petersburg, skip St.Isaac and Peter and Paul, this is the one to see.I definitely recommend this visit."

More impressive than St. Basil's in Moscow. Completely restored after decades of neglect and abuse. Extended hours (6-10 PM) were offered when we visited it in June, and the admission was 400 RUB with no discount. There was no lines or crowds. We got to enjoy the brilliant interior at a leisurely pace. Highly recommend visiting it during extended hours to better appreciate its beauty and magnificence. I was awe-struck when I entered the church. Bright and fresh. Mosaics on all the walls and ceilings, and equally beautiful floors. Be sure to walk around the exterior and by the river to admire the intricate exterior from all sides. Kazan Cathedral is a 5-minute stroll away. A perfect after dinner activity to cover both places in the summer."

A popular tourist attraction so expect quite a few people there, rain or shine. The real lure for many is the exterior, but if you are interested in the history and interior (which can feel a little claustrophobic, given the mix of gold and all-covered colored walls), you can visit inside. But, if you're pressed for time or just want to admire a truly gorgeous church, a stroll around this building and the nearby gardens can be inspiring enough."

My ticket caught inside but was easy to retrieve by opening the draw and reaching in a bit further. It took me a little while to get a guide to help me and I felt a bit daft when I saw how easy it was to retrieve. The audio guide is pretty standard with a lot of info. As my bible knowledge is a bit Sunday School it put the images in context. Use your own headphones though as the issued ones were very quiet. It is beautiful church and highly ornate and up with some of the best in the world, if that's your thing. The restoration is great but it shows how revolutionary periods can destroy heritage as they deal with the issues of war or ideology. Thankfully the Russians kept in spite of all their issues and it looks great.I only had an hour which was enough but I'd of preferred a more leisurely visit"

Their variety and positioning give viewers a multitude of angles to view the church. You could spend hours just looking at the outside. The inside is floor to ceiling mosaics. Gorgeous and almost overwhelming. The workmanship is incredible and between the mosaic portraits of saints and the embellished architecture it's almost necessary to close your eyes and clear your thoughts before proceeding. I truly wish we had a longer visit and that it hadn't come at the end of a long day of sight-seeing and learning. Take your time and appreciate all the beauty. "

Important to remember about this place is that it appeared to this world twice: once from the creative impulse of an architect and a monk following the will of the Russian Emperor, and the second time from the deep decay by the will of the Russians who need their history\u2026 The d\u00e9cor looks really magnificent, but rare visitor could imagine how it looked like just 20 years back. When I was a little girl, I passed by this wonderful building, its doors were always locked and no one could answer me what is inside. It was a real mystery for me...I first was able to see it a decade ago and it is still a mystery... The last mystery is one more of its jewels put in place \u2013 the unique piece of jewelry art \u2013 the altar door! These are the doors recreated using old black-and-white sketches of the original from opaque silver, gold and enamel with the colour pallete of 250 colours. It took 8 years alone to recreate the colour palette! All the colours are opaque which makes manufacturing process complicated even for modern technologies in jewelry. Every flower required a certain (and different) combination of burning at high temperatures\u2026 In result one hardly can take one\u2019s eyes away! Thank you to the jewelry artists : architect Kochetova, enamel artist Solomnikova and metal artist Nokolsky! Awesome! There is no analogue in the world!"

What took 24 years to complete is an amazing tribute to a fallen king and Christ himself. The walls are covered in mosaics and the spires have a unique shape intended to keep snow from accumulating. The images you will find here are purely magic. We would recommend an early visit for exterior images, there are many options within the facility and photos are permitted. It was shared that women needed a scarf for entry to cover their hair. This is no longer the case. Respect for the facility is enough.

The construction was completed almost 25 years later and its a fantastic example of Russian Church Architecture with its famous onion domes.

This church is iconic in more ways than one. It is probably one of the main reasons tourists flock to see what many think of when you think \"Russia\". The unique outside architecture is what draws you here. It is truly beautiful and visions of the onion top that you will see here feeds the adventure in all who love travel. The outside could even be enough, but then the inside is overwhelmingly addicting to any art lover, or for those who appreciate religious history, it is there. And then, there is the history of it's past, which has quite a story. So, of course you will go, because it is much too great to miss for sure."

Unlike the slightly boring baroque European style prevelant in the rest of St. Petersburg the Russian Revival style was chosen; so unlike other buildings in the City this Curch looks and fells like real Russia - like the golden domes in Moscow and the Golden Ring. The outside with its gilded and coloured domes is magnificent from all angles with its intricate detailing and stunning fresco over the main entrance. Inside is just a riot of colour and splendour, totaly ornate everywhere; from the multi coloured marble floor, the highly stylised and painted columns, to the ceiling and stunning iconostasis. Some twenty types of minerals are used. The Church is a museum and reopened in 1998 after some 20 years of careful renovation. If you only visit one Church in St. Petersbug this is the one - you will be stunned. Just take your time and let it all sink in and forget the tourists around you - they soon dissapear."

Moreover, it's situated in the very center of the city, so, simply walking along Nevskiy you will definitely end up by entering it! It has an incredibly beautiful exterior, but don't limit yourself by just taking pictures from outside! It's like a magic jewel box, inside it hides even more..we recommend (we did it in summer, so, check that the option is available in other seasons) to enter the church after 18.00 (in summer it is open till 22.00, so it will be not crowded and you will have lots of time to see everything in details). If you speak Russian, a guided tour is included in the entrance price, if not, you can pay for audioguides (available in several languages, not only in English)"

The Church of the Savior on Blood, also known as the Church on Spilt Blood, is dedicated to Alexander II who was killed outside it by a bomb. The startling external beauty of the church makes one thankful that the plans to raze it to the ground in the Soviet times was stopped by the city architect who probably recognized its artistic value. It is artistically exquisite, a masterpiece of mosaic and design. This is a must-see in St Petersburg. TIP: try to come early to beat the crowds. Beware pickpockets, there are many reports of successful stealing in the tourist-heavy areas of St Petersburg."

The artwork and monuments inside are truly inspiring and a must see. It is great that they allow photography inside (just no tripods or flashes) and there are enough descriptive signs should you wish not to purchase the additional audio guide. The only thing dropping the full five stars for me was that there were no toilet facilities within the building. Within the area you\u2019re limited to a \u2018pay at the window\u2019 portaloo on the street outside and nothing else. Do consider this as I found it a little surprising. Added to this you\u2019re only able to wander around a single area of the building and this felt a little underwhelming, although I can\u2019t argue that what you can see is impressive. As a result you can't dedicate even an hour to looking around the interior, although plenty of photo opportunities outside. Still, a sight to take the time out to visit."

The view on this church is amaizing when you from the side where the entrace is, but much better view you will have when you exit the church on the other side. The church is very impresive from outside, but when you once enter the church you will be even more inpressed. The paintings inside are inpresive, take enough time to walk all around the church when you are inside, and dont miss to find the small cross on the right side in front of you when you are looking from the point where you have entered the church especially when you are there and the sunlight is falling from outside through the small window on this small magnificent cross.Inside the church you will also find a small shop, but its better to buy the suveniers outside the church, just when you exit the church on the opposide side then you have entered it !

The entire inside of the church is mosaic tile, the floor, walls, ceiling, columns. The tiles are made of various stones( malachite, jasper, marble, etc). Amazing to see all this beautiful art work and then get up close and see that it is florentine mosaic. This Church of the Savior is also called Church of the Spilled Blood, because Alex II was assassinated at this site in 1881 and they built the church in 1883. Interesting to note that orthodox churches do not have pews as they stand for their 1 hour services."

While visits after 6pm cost double the daytime entry fee (800 ruble instead of 400), the lack of crowds and tour buses makes it money well spent. Light is still great for inside and external shots. Can get audio guide for 100 ruble but we found from what we had read previously it wasn't necessary. You will already be familiar with the exterior which is great to see and photo but the internal mosaics are outstanding pieces of work. Small display in one corner at rear shows some of the restoration work photos and processes."

Russian churches and cathedrals are always a monument to holiness, devotion and reverence, crammed solid with relics, gold and silver - but there are some that simply take your breath away as soon as you walk in and this is one of them. Not that you have much breath left anyway after taking in that gorgeous, lush exterior, which is seriously not done justice in any pictures. You need to stand there to appreciate the intricacies and marvel at the onion domes and decorations. Inside, your mind will be blown. Every single square metre of wallspace is either a painting, a mosaic (these are stunning), a relic, gold leaf covered statue, icon or such marble / stone as you have never seen. I don't have superlatives for what I saw. The memorial to the spot where Alexander was killed is suitably Russian sombre but splendiferous. Some practical information: We, not speaking much Russian, had absolutely no problems in St Petersburg whatsoever. There is usual SOME English information available inside and out and you can easily get into the church. The prices are very reasonable. We were early in the season, when the queues are not so heavy but do be prepared for a crowd and a wait at the ticket office. Also, we would recommend that you take the audio guided tour, which is very detailed and well worth the 100 Rubels (at time of writing around UK \u00a31.30)."

It is built in the traditional Russian style with ornate onion shaped domes and elaborate decoration. The interior is nothing less than spectacular - it holds Russia's largest collection of mosaics adorning the ceilings, every wall and the columns. The mosaics are made of coloured glass, lapis lazuli, malachite, gold leaf and many other precious stones. Mostly destroyed during the Revolution and siege of Leningrad the church was re-built and the building was re-opened in 1997.A visit to this Cathedral is a MUST - I found it to be the most spectacular place I visited in St. Petersburg."

From the time you try to take in all of the mosaics covering the outside of this building until you enter and see even greater mosaic detail covering everything in the church, you are in awe. The Church was built to commemorate the place where Russian Emperor Alexander II was assassinated. But it has only recently been restored and some of the alter pieces are actually paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9\" and you would never know the difference. Russian artistry survives. To see the beauty of the Church is a must but try to arrange a private tour to understand the incredible history of the building over its\"lifetime."

It was looted and vandalised after the Russian Revolution but has since had a 27 year restoration. Fantastic outside with the enamel onion domes and famed for its mosaics internally, some 7500 sq. m of them. A great place for photographs and its location on one of the canals is just stunning."

Make sure you walk all the way around and even on the other side of the water to get the full views she broadcasts. Look closely at all the details of the masonry, domes, and decorative art work that give this building it's external uniqueness.Inside it is even more exquisite. The use of so many elements to raise the beauty of this church to a high level.Again slowly consume not only the floors, pulpits, walls, and ceilings but the displays scattered throughout also. Intricately detailed mosaics coupled with a varying use of marble also makes this Place of GOD special. The name \"Spilled Blood\" is most popular name for tourists but, Church of the Resurrection, Church of our Savior on the Blood, Cathedral of the Ascension, Resurrection of the Christ, or Assumption, Church of the Redeemer, Church on Spilt Blood, and a few more I don't remember are probably more accurate.Do yourself a favour and come early because the LINES will be long and longer as the day progresses.

All three are in the heart of St Petersburg, so you can't miss them!"

This church was meant as a memorial to Tsar Alexander II after he was blown up by revolutionaries. It was closed and ransacked in 1930, used as a morgue during the siege of Leningrad, and then used as a vegetable warehouse, before it was restored to be used as a tourist attraction. It has never been reconsecrated as a church To give it it's due,there is fairy tale architecture, an over abundance of mosaics and fine frescos and a nice outside sitting area, where buskers entertain. Is it so popular because it is so convenient to visit.?"

When we visited, the crowds were immense so be prepared for this and keep small children by the hand at all times. We were also warned of the inevitable pick-pocket threat.Outside is as much a wonder as inside so try and plan your visit to coincide with clement weather.

It is amazing that every one of the murals is a mosaic. There is nothing painted and every inch is covered in gorgeous art work, a feast for the eyes.

You do well to pay attention to details, perhaps you should carry a camera with zoom capabilities or binoculars. The church is really popular among tourists, so expect a lot of them and street vendors. The church is excessive and the whole St. Petersburg is full of monumental buildings. There seemed to be a competition, who can build the most over the top building in St. Petersburg, while ordinary people could not afford bread. Revolution was a natural outcome of that disparity of construction bulimia and desperation. That is even in the Bible. The revolutionaries used icons for target practices. What makes me wonder is that they did not force the priests to hold them still. It was build for a killed czar. The Romanovs did not get the warning."

However it is beautiful in its own way \u2013 albeit an incredibly ornate way (inside and out) on a level that I doubt can truly be appreciated through photos. The interior walls and ceilings are completely done in finely-detailed tile mosaics and alters are made of a wide variety of jaspers, granites and semi-precious stone. The images are stunning, mesmerizing in a way I could not have imagined and they are impossible to take in (especially with the unending crowds).The church was built on the spot where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in March 1881 after many key reforms. I simply cannot imagine the job of designing and planning the construction of this building \u2013 or the restoration job undertaken in 1970 to repair the damage done through the revolution and WW II.There are beautiful views in all directions from near and far \u2013 especially as seen along the canal."

Alexander II's biography by Edward Radzinsky was especially helpful in this. The interior mosaics are rather interesting, and I always enjoy seeing how the saints are represented (in this church they look a lot like Mary Pickford). There was a rather interesting display of building tiles at the exit counter, too bad it was in Russian so I didn't learn as much as I would have liked. It was fulfilling for me to walk the area and try to see the placement of the assassins and how they plotted. We even walked to the nearby Malaya Sadovaya to see where The People's Will mined the road to blow up the tsar's carriage. If you are interested in the revolutionists' work, you may be interested in this site. Russian Revival architecture leaves me cold, but it's worth it to see this church if only for the bragging rights later. If I hadn't known so much history about Alexander II , III and Nicholas II, I probably wouldn't have been very interested in this church, although it is very colorful!!!"

The only down side was, the church can get very crowded and you tend to get pushed along and can miss seeing all the items on show. Try to go early in the day as my party went midday and I wished we had been allowed more time as it was very busy. Please make a trip to the church you cannot miss the building because it is as impressive on the outside with its coloured orthodox domes as it is on the inside.

Incredible architecture and onion domed towers. The interior is what is truly amazing as all the walls are covered by small colored tiles that make up these incredible murals. Even though you will be pushed through by the crowds (in the summer months) and not be able to linger as long as you wish, it is well worth visiting whenever you can.Another very similar place not too far away is St. Isaacs. The exteriors are very different but the interiors are finished out in the same style. St. Isaacs is larger but there are still plenty of people to keep you moving in the summer.

And the woodworking in the parquet floors are also marvelous, but then the overdone gold altars seem out of place with the rest. The historic significance is interesting, in that the church was built on the spot were Tsar Nicholas I was assassinated. His son commissioned the church and the mosaics that decorate it, in his honor.Although ascetically disjointed, it is a classic Orthodox church with the icons displayed in mosaic fashion. It is a definite must see to understand and appreciate the historic significance and the wealth that was Tsarist Russia."

All very square looking and quite European but they were stunning theatres, museums and palaces etc, then we walked to the Church of the Saviour of Spilled Blood, the place we had been waiting for and it was breathtakingly beautiful. The onion style roof covered in mosaic and gold! and the inside was painted in gold depicting stories from the bible, my favourite depicture was Moses on Mount Sion receiving the tablet of stone. This was a truly wonderful experience for anyone who appreciates architecture. I couldn't believe it was used for storing vegetables during the cold war!!"

With its flamboyant architecture, it is a little out of place in St Petersburg but within the walls is a special shrine that guards the original section of cobblestoned street where Tsar Alexander II was murdered in 1881.The Soviet government closed the church in 1930's and it was used for many years to store vegetables. 27 years of restoration was needed to return the church's wonderful mosaics to their former glory. The official name of the church is The Church of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and is well-worth the visit."

We could see it from other parts of the city as we were driving around in our mini tour bus.Our tour here took about 30 minutes and then we took pictures and looked at souvenirs. I thought it was worth it given it's location. Because it was part of our tour I don't know how much it cost. I gave it 5 stars because it's so beautiful and there's an interesting story.

But inside is a feast of mosaic work that is simply breathtaking. Colourful, meaningful, incredibly ornate. This represents a tribute to the craftsmen and women, and those with the vision to create it. Yes, one may criticise the money spent on this, but it does seem to represent an act of worship by its creators, and serves to promote an aspect of the Christian message which is core to a church's or church building's existence."

Make sure you walk around to the other side from where the coaches stop to view the main entrance, and avoid the costumed \"photo opportunities\" who seemed to descend on each party as they arrived offering to have pictures taken with you.

It is located adjacent to a canal and is an imposing sight when first encountered. It is built on the site where Emperor Alexander 11 was assassinated in March 1981by a group of revolutionaries who threw a bomb at his royal carriage. It was built between 1883 and 1907 and its construction was funded by the imperial family and private contribution. Similar and of equal magnificence to St. Basils in Moscow, no visit to St Petersburg would be complete without a visit. The artwork on the inside is totally of large Russian inconic Orthodox type art and is mainly mosaic. This is totally different to the Renaissance art featured in European Cathedrals and will either appeal to you or not. This church contains a lot of Russian history of both the Tsars and the Communist eras and was closed back in the 1930's by the Bolsheviks and had not been reopened until recent time for religious purposes. Anyone visiting St Petersburg really needs to include this one on their wish list."

I realize this church was built long before any vehicular traffic was around it but it takes something away from the pleasure if visiting and seeing the church when the traffic and the buses and the taxis and the insane drivers put the fear of getting mowed over above any other thoughts you might have while visiting St. Petersburg. The church is located in a very busy area of the city (of course it's busy because of all the tourists wanting to see it), so just be aware when crossing the street around the church. The architecture is unlike anything I have seen before and the colours are absolutely inspiring. We didn't have a lot of time to spend there but it was certainly worth seeing it. If you are in St. Petersburg it's certainly a must do."

This is one of the main landmarks in St. Petersburg and all of Russia.Make sure to check out both sides on the outside, while the view is basically the same it is nice to see one side with the canal by the side.With many of the church in St. Petersburg, I opted to stay outside and not pay for a ticket to go inside. Nearly all of the churches are no longer churches but have been turned into museums so that they can charge an entrance fee. The ticket office is right next to the entrance and when we went the line was only 2-3 minutes long as was the wait to enter. We did not buy the audio guide as we had tried to do own research before entering, but audio guides are available.The inside is absolutely stunning. Detailed mosaics cover every square inch from floor to ceiling (actually including the ceiling!). Be sure to check out the roped off area where Tsar Alexander II was assassinated (the reason that the church was built on that specific site). Regular photographs are allowed throughout and is included in the entrance fee.When we went it was quite crowded, especially with tour groups as it was nearing the end of summer. Remain patient and expect that people will be bumping into you as they stay together in their tour groups. There is also a gift shop (prices are quite expensive) that sells souvenirs related to the church, St. Petersburg, and Russia."

This church has really been through a lot. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the church was ransacked and looted, badly damaging it's interior. The Soviets shut the structure in the 1930's. During WW II the church was used as a temporary morgue for those who died in combat and the many who died from starvation and illness. After the war, the church was used as a warehouse for vegetables. Even though I always prefer seeing the original surfaces, this church has been beautifully restored. We enjoyed viewing the opulant, mosaic covered interiors."

If you think this church looks pretty special from the outside, nothing prepares you for what it holds on the inside, as your breath is taken away by every bit of floor, ceiling and walls covered in iconic paintings and mosaics of various saints. We were very impressed with it and the assassination spot of the Tsar Alexander is there on view where they built the church around it .We got a great sense of history which overtook us in this church. We went on our own, so missed a lot of what the Russian tour guides were talking about, but no words were necessary to see all that was on display. Cost was 250 roubles, payable in local currency or credit card, and translated into less than $20 for the wife and I."

Not all tour groups visit this church - our tour was with TJ Travel and was a small-group tour that visited both inside and outside. As another poster has said, the disadvantage is the crowds - but that is unavoidable throughout St Petersburg. Actually, our guide recommended visiting in the winter when all the buildings are centrally-heated and the crowds have gone - worth considering if you have the cold-weather gear!!"

We paid for our guide to go in, and I'm glad we did, because she had things to add about the history of the church (e.g. how the communists treated the building). The thing I liked best was the ability to pick out stories from the Bible from the mosaics. Sometimes stained glass in churches depicts scenes that are not obvious, but the mosaics depict scenes from the gospels that can be easily identified by any Christian.

Well if you ever get the chance to go to St Petersburg you should. It is a beautiful city and this Cathedral is absolutely amazing especially when you see all the mosiacs inside the church of saints which must have taken years to do. St Petersburg is rich in culture and history and I would love to go back if I ever have the chance to so that I could do the bits that I missed."

St. Petersburg is a wonderful city and so rich with history, architecture, culture etc. There is so much to see - I hope you have enough time for everything. But, if you know anything about this city, you certainly understand that you need at least several months - and most of us don't have this luxury. So, for a short visit, these are absolutely must-see places: Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood, Isaac Cathedral, and Hermitage. This church is so beautiful and unique!"

Most likely it will fill your memory card with stunning photos of it lingering over the canal, but make sure you go inside as well! Priced at 250 rubles it's not the cheapest of attractions but is still worth it. The church is built over the spot where Tsar Alexander II was assassinated so of course there is a memorial inside dedicated to him that you must see. Take your time to absorb the details and craftsmanship of the interior as it can be easy to speed through the inside. This is something that you absolutely have to do/see in St. Petersburg!"

As Tsar Alexander's carriage passed along the canal, a grenade thrown by an anarchist conspirator exploded. The tsar, falling out of the carriage, started to confront the grenade thrower and a second bomb was thrown mortally wounding the tsar. Alexander III build the church as a memorial to his father. The most stunning part of this church is the incredible number of mosaics depicting biblical scenes and figures in it's interior. As with many other landmarks in St. Petersburg, the church was badly damaged during WWII. It was reopened less than 20 years ago as a museum. No services are held here."

We were there first thing, hired the audio guide and had half an hour before the tour groups started to arrive in ernest. Being on our own allowed us to spend as long as we wanted at any one spot and fit into a quiet corner and observe the building. Because the mosaics etc are above head height, there does not seem to be as much of a problem with viewing. We were given a laminated map of the audio guide route, it would be extremely helpful to people like me ( direction ability deprived) to have compass points marked on it as the audio refers to these. One of the best thing to me about seeing this church was, it allowed me to imagine the beauty of such places as Hagia Sophia in its hay days."

Its architecture is not only spectacular (and different from the other beautiful churches found in the city), but the interior with its exceptional mosaics is stunning. Moreover, the church is historic in that it was built on the site where Tsar Alexander II (who liberated the serfs) was mortally wounded. Be sure to see the memorial inside and outside the church marking the spot where the tsar was assassinated. Also, try to check out the plaques posted on the ground near the railings around the church which state the major events in the tsar's life. The church, within walking distance from the other major attractions in the center of the city, should be among the top three sites to visit in St. Petersburg."

You have to look very closely to notice that the pictures are mostly mosaics which are formed into remarkable works of art. Yes, it was very busy but we found that other tourists were willing to share the best vantage spots for photographs.Originally built by Alexander 111 to mark the place where Alexander 11 was assassinated it is no longer a consecrated building.

Go see if for yourself and decide."

The Church of Our Savior on the Spilled Blood actually has a few names but the important part is it is called on the Spilled Blood because Alexander the Second was mortally wounded where the canopy stands in the church. He was attacked 9 times because he wanted Democratic reforms that the politicians didn't want. Inside the church there are 7,000 square meters of mosaics. It is built in the16th century style but wasn't actually built until the beginning of the 20th century. This is a must see! "

It is situated in the heart of historical center of the city, close to Russian museum, Michailovsky park with picturesque fence, and Mars square and Summer garden. it is not large so you will not get tired and you may walk around for the hole evening else.

We've seen our fair share of churches and cathedrals of the Christian variety but our experience with Orthodox churches is fairly limited, a few days in Greece and fewer days in and near Russia. This certainly at the top of the class in our experience. The church is quite impressive from the outside and more so inside. It is covered in icons and mosaic throughout and would not be described as understated. As some recent reviewers have noted, it is fortunate to have survived the Communist Regime. Our guide said that it was used during those days as storage for fruits and vegetables. In any event we world travelers and the people of St Petersburg are fortunate to have this church available to the public today."

Built in the more traditional style of Russian Orthodox churches, it is less like the other major churches in the city which are more western in exterior style. The mosaics are phenomenal as is the memorial to Alexander II with its unique dome. The relationship of the marble used in the church to the tombs of Alexander and his wife in the fortress, the story of the unexploded Nazi bomb nestled near the heart of the Pantocrator in the dome, and the scriptural stories on the inside walls and how they relate to Alexander's life story on the outside walls made our visit to this church more meaningful."

Check out the history as to why it was constructed in the first place! The interior is stunning with mosaic \"pictures\", the floor beautiful, the history of its restoration fascinating. The exterior dominates the City. Enjoy...."

            "review": "\"Blood\" refers to Alexander II who was killed here. This church was on our itinerary with SPB Tours who offered multiple day sightseeing tours of St. Petersburg attractions. The Russian architecture of the church is probably the main reason for a visit, but another might be to see the place of the Russian czar's assassination in the late 1800's. The church is a visual delight both inside and outside. The multi-colored onion domes outside are noticeable from many places in St. Petersburg, but the unusual details and colors of blues, greens, and gold leaf on the exterior walls are only seen with a visit to the church. Inside, there are no benches, seating, or pews as the church is not a working church, only a memorial to a past czar. The interior is one big open space, a little on the dark side, with a huge floor mosaic in the middle. Our guide focused on the reno of this mosaic noting the skills needed to do such work. More mosaics of biblical figures with gilt embellishment were visible all the way up the walls. The inside of the domes are also spectacular with gold leafed and painted religious figures. The tall gilt gates at the front of the church glitter with colorful stones. As I turned to exit, my attention was finally directed towards the massive memorial at the back of the church built on the spot where Alexander II was maimed by a terrorist bomb, but bled to death shortly afterward in his palace bed. The original cobblestone roadway, where the czar's blood was spilled, was incorporated as the floor for this memorial. It too is dark using a burgundy type marble/stone and is built to resemble a Greek temple with its 4 corner columns, a canopy, and ornamental oversized vases. It is hard to think that this magnificent building was so badly used after 1917, but it has regained its rightful place as an outstanding memorial. Expect crowds on your visit. Go to see the gorgeous mosaics inside."

Stunningly beautiful both outside and in, from a distance and from up close, this is an absolute must-see sight in St. Petersburg. And, it's a lot easier to get into and through than the massive Hermitage. Built in the early 20th century to commemorate the spot where the beloved Czar Alexander II was assassinated by disgruntled right-wing conservatives who did not like the fact he had freed the serfs, it is 20th century but looks medieval. In fact, from the outside, it looks incredibly much like St. Basil's Cathedral in Red Square, Moscow. However, that church was built starting in the 12th or 13th century (or something like that), so it is much, much, much older and different than this one in St. Petersburg. Both are must-see sights."

Outside is typically Russian, modeled after the great church of Moscow. Colorful spires with exotic shapes. Looking at it upriver from a bridge on the Main street is a sight never to be forgotten. Once you enter, you will be truly amazed. It is all made of mosaic pieces,beautiful intricate designs. Visual overload. This was the sight of St Petersburg I was most impressed with.

This visit (June 2014) we just wanted to take some quality pictures for long memories. The day before the visit we walked from our hotel to ask about photographing. The answer was definitely positive. So next day we came with our Nikon mounted on the small tripod to make it easy to hold the camera and get a good picture without a flash. As soon as we got our tickets ($8.00) and approached the check point, we heard that tripod photography is prohibited. We promised to the guard that we'll use the tripod only for support and we'll not open the legs, and we kept that promise. 25 steps later an elderly female guard again told us: no tripod! We explained to her but seems she could say only \"Net-Net-Net!\" In Russian. Then she went to call the supervisor, and a nice young lady speaking English a little bit, came and let us take some pictures without opening the tripod's legs. She explained to that elderly (obviously, ex KGB agent during the Cold War). Then we took some pictures but that elderly agent never left us alone, we never got out of her sight. Very personal attention considering several hundreds people inside of the church at that time! She left us only when we were buying some souvenirs, just a few steps before the exit door, another ex KGB agent stopped us asking for a written permission to take photos. We could not help ourselves but laughed and left! We feel that non-flash/monopod photography is much better for preserving the icons not to mention the more damage to the floor from high heels than rubber coated feet of the monopod do. We loved the church but we were treated very rudely."

But the place has no sense of spirituality when compared with a holy place such as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan, where ladies with head scarves form long lines to kiss and pray to the icon of Maria. So: Do visit this site, but view it largely as an art exhibit."

The decoration is incredible and you'll spend half your time just admiring the ceilings - be sure to get up close to the walls too, to see the detail and some of the restoration.There's a small display toward the exit that details restoration that happened after WWII and the siege of Leningrad.No toilets available inside, but there is a paid for booth outside the front, near where the tour buses park."

Much more impressive than St. Basil in Moscow.Make sure that you enter, and spend time just taking in all of the glorious interior mosaics. The history of the church is also fascinating so do not forget to do your research.You do not need a tour for this attraction, and tickets can be purchased right in the front."

If you are short on time or money and trying to decide between this one and St Isaac's Cathedral, go with St. Isaacs IMHO, unless you happen to be really into mosaics.

If you have the time there is information you can read but we were given head sets and a local guide was pointing out the important bits. It does get VERY busy and you do have to shuffle along or get out of the flow of other visitors if you wish to take photos ( NO FLASH) Although we had been in 2011 we went back in 2013 because we wanted to take some more photos and marvel at such a magnificent achievement.

It took 14 years to reconstruct the mosaics and wow, what a great job they've done. Tiny tiles cover the entire interior walls, ceilings and pillars and form beautiful biblical scenes. Try not to visit on a Friday or weekend however if you have to go then, don't despair. Russians love this place as much as tourists, so prepare for a crowd. Ignore them all and enjoy the beauty and workmanship of the place. In the forecourt at the rear along the canal there are souvenir stalls offering anything you're looking for.

I would recommend exploring the inside but try to go before the tourist buses arrive. The exterior is breathtaking and provides some great photo ops.

There is a \"red blood spot\" inside, supposedly from the assassination, but as guides explain, it never darkens, and stays red. Hmmmm....sounds like it keeps repainting itself, or so they say.Beautiful architecture. The colored spires, so Russian, so classic it's like what you imagine and see on travelogs. Fantastic!"

The exterior is exquisite and absolutely glows in beauty. It commemorates the location where Alexander II was assassinated by terrorists in 1881 ( after 6 prior attempts, the 7th, being the final). Given the year of his death, the main dome was designed to stand 81 meters tall.This cathedral has so much lure behind it, it's just more enchanting than one can stand. It quite recently underwent 27 years of restoration during which, (according to Marina Zhdanova's book :Alternative Petersburg--we found this book in the Singer Building for sale and is a recommended purchase) the Cathedral was supported by wooden support pillars. When they were taken down in 1991, it was the year that the Soviet Union saw its collapse. There are supposedly other important dates in Russian history that are associated by icons within the building. Now, how cool is that?The interior is just mesmerizing. I really could have spent days in there just meditating and letting myself let the spirits of history into my soul. Many people were in there receiving communion and lighting their memorial candles. It contains over 7000 square feet of mosaic murals on its walls. AND! You are allowed to photograph in there, so be prepared for this treat.For you cats lovers: It seems that most of the Cathedrals in St. Petersburg we visited had a patron cat, so you can have some fun trying to find them. The one in \"Spilled Blood\" sort of found me without me searching it out.Tips: We went later in the day when a lot of the tour buses cleared out, so there were no lines and fewer people. Also, if you are looking for gifts, they have a small gift shop, but they have some nice items (non-religious too) that were classier than the street venders, fairly priced, and whom I trusted to use my credit with."

It's definitely worth it to get an audio guide for another 100 rubles, you get a bit of history about the church, the site and a detailed explanation of the church interior.There is also a small display showing how the church was restored after it was pronounced an historic site, very interesting.Definitely a must see when is St Petersburg."

This is definitely a place you would want to stop if visiting St. Petersburg. We were actually glad it was the last point of our day as this is quite an icon for the city. The structure of the building, the canal on its right side, and the beautiful little park are simply a great discovery. If you get a chance to visit the inside, you might want to take it. This is the only deception that we have had with our stopped, is that we could not go in to take a couple of photos (not sure that they were allowed anyway). If you are like us, you will definitely call this area a \"click point\"... where you won't stop take photos of this beautiful World Heritate structure.

Took my breath away and the significance in history makes you appreciate the relative peaceful times we have grown up in. Bucket list worthy!!"

This was my first ever visit to an Russian Orthodox Church and I was astounded by its beauty and meticulous craftsmanship in the construction and decoration. From the outside the colourful and golden domes touched on by the suns rays,the inside a mosaic of colour and gold truly splendid, well worth the 5\u20ac entrance fee. It is possible to ride past it on one of the canal rides to get a different perspective of the building. A must see!"

Inside the church is equally breathtaking with all the walls and ceilings covered in Mosaics.The outside view is known to any who have research Saint Peterburg as a destination but the inside has so much I can only say go see it."

Also the fact that it has never served as a place of worship it has no \"spiritual \" feeling; it is like a monument to a church but not a church. Hard to explain but I prefer places like Isaac's Cathedral or Kazan Cathedral ( both within walking distance) who though not so colourful yet have a soul. that's just my opinion of course others will tell you that it is a must and that the colourful mosaics are impressive, it is just overwhelming - too much for the size of the place...."

I did the audio tour and my friend just wandered with a pamphlet - either way take time out to just look and take it all in. We were lucky it was winter and the crowd and queue was manageable.

The inside of the Church is filled with beautiful mosiacs. We were told by a former visitor that this was a \"must see\" and it is. You would never see a church built like this today because the cost of the craftsmanship would be far too high. It is so nice that these places have been maintained for all of us to see.

Unlike the several other major orthodox churches in the central part of St. Petersburg, this one looks stereotypically \"Russian\" with its cluster of brightly colored onion domes and spires and a picture of it along the canal is an iconic tourist shot. This is a decommisioned church; a state museum, not a functuioning house of worship and as such can feel a little spiritually sterile; no gutted candles in front of the icons, no priests chanting in basso profoundo. The late 19th century mosaics are beautiful, the whole restoration work is quite spectacular. Avoid the souvenir stands; prices are among the highest for similar items you are likely to find in Russia."

Once we got inside it was very crowded, I only mention this, so others know to be careful atthis impressive attraction in Russia.

One of the most unusual buildings of classical St-Petersburg, the church of Resurrection of the Christ nicknamed our Savior on the Spilled blood, was completed and sanctified in 1908, after 27 years of assassination of Alexander II. It copies the style of medieval Russian churches and is obviously one of the most picturesque churches of our city. It is a memorial of formation of Russian democracy, started from liberal reforms that were understood as \"permissiveness\" and caused terrorism widespread among young people...Since the museum is very popular it is always very crowdy there. If you plan to take pictures, come between 7 and 9 AM. In winter - as soon it gets light (appr. 10-11 AM). Museum opens at 11 AM, Wed is a day off. It is famous as a building with the biggest mosaic square - 75,000 m2 inside and outside. If you decide to go inside, you have to buy a ticket (MIND -it is not a functioning church, it is a museum!) and an audio-guide is advisable if you go on your own, without a private guide. Pickpocketing - unfortunately - is one of the disadvantages of that popular place and therefore - be alert like you are in Rome!"

Take a boat tour of the canals in St. Pete as well as the fort across the river from the Hermitage. The Hermitage, alone, takes 3 days to see all of it. We were in Russia for a month. In Moscow, you must see Red Square especially in the spring so you can observe the many wedding parties celebrating. Also, visit the Kremlin which is simply the original walled city of Moscow dating back to the 1400s. The shopping mall across Red Square from Lenin's Tomb (no longer open to the public) is something to behold but be prepared for sticker shock as there are many Rolls Royces in the parking lot.

The artwork is all mosaics, but the quality is far superior to anything I remember seeing elsewhere. The faces of the figures are detailed, and give each an individual character. The shading of the colours mean that fabrics appear to hang like cloth. Dark tiles are used to outline the figures, giving them a sharpness not usually seen in mosaics. And if this wasn't enough, just opposite is a great market with, so far, the best and most eclectic range of traditional souvenirs we have seen - I haven't bought yet, because I'm still in St P and looking, but so far it looks as though I am going to be going back there."

When you visit and see the number of people waiting to get in you expect the worst but inside had plenty of room to move about and take photos I don't know what to review that could give anyone reason to see it but honestly you won't regret it it's is absolutely beautiful, be aware of neck ache from looking up too long"

It was beyond any expectations - beautiful inside and out! As always, St Petersburg proved itself as one of the most beautiful cities of the world. After you visit the church, take a walk along the canal to Nevsky Avenue or take a boat tour on Neva river. Avoid buying souvenirs near the church. They are low quality and overpriced. Better go to the Souvenir department in Gostiny Dvor (\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440) on Nevsky.

This was a new experience for us to see such a unique and breathtaking church - Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood (Russian: \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438, Tserkov\u02b9 Spasa na Krovi). This stunning Russian-style church was built between 1883 and 1907 on the location where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in March 1881. It is one of the most popular and crowded attractions in St. Petersburg. Its appearance differs from other churches in the city of St. Petersburg; it is a Russian-style church similar to the St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow.The church is located in the city center and is easily accessible from the Nevsky Prospekt (Russian: \u041d\u0435\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0301\u043a\u0442) metro station. It takes less than 10 minutes (500 m/1650 ft) by walking along the Griboedova canal from the metro station. You can recognize it easily when you are on the sidewalk of the canal. The church is composed of red and brown brick and features a fantastic ornate \"Russian-style\" exterior of traditional colorful onion domes, ceramic tiles, colored glazed bricks and white marble. Inside you will view one of the largest mosaic collections in Europe. Its large works of colorful mosaics include different religious themes as well as an extensive collection of Christian images that can last much longer than traditional painting normally found in churches. The dome ceiling is covered with the mosaic image of Christ the Pantocrator.The church has suffered damage during several wars, the Russian Revolution being the most ruinous. It took 27 years to revive the exceptional 7500 square meters of mosaics to its original look from 1970. The restoration was completed in 1997. We were lucky enough to enjoy this masterpiece today and saw how the artists could make the mosaics so consummate. We also learned that the building is not really a church since it has never been used for worship services; it was built to be a memorial. It is now a museum of Mosaics.This was the only place that I spent all my time taking photos and not paying much attention listening to our guide of my St. Petersburg\u2019s trip. I was also the last one of my group to leave the church. It is a beautiful and unforgettable visit."

Its exuberant onion domes are covered in multi-coloured tiles, and are one of the few 'old Russian' sights in a Europeanised city. It was built deliberately in an archaic style in 1883, but is none the worse for that. Inside, it is equally colourful, with every surface covered in mosaic, and with subtle light diffusing through the complex interior spaces. We spent quite a long time looking at this church. Don't miss it."

I've seen pictures of it online and in books, but none do it any justice once your own eyes gaze upon it. Our tour bus rolled up alongside it and let us off across the street, adjacent to a street crafts fair (aka - flea market). When you first lay eyes upon this church, you can't help but stare at the vivid colors on the onion-shaped roof features. It spans such an array of colors. With our Grand Tour 2-Day excursion from our Carnival Cruise we skipped the line and our group of 44 from the Carnival Legend walked immediately into the church to begin our tour of the inside. It's inside where you can witness hundreds of years of artistry upon the walls and ceiling of the church. The walls are decorated with the most intricately painted artwork of an era not seen for centuries. Last time I saw this highly detailed artistry and elegance in a church was Italy with its Duomo in Florence and the Vatican Museum among a great many others there. There is an abundance of gold used in the paintings on the walls as well as the domed ceilings. Also in the church is the resting place of Alexander The Great. His tomb is marked by a grandiose structure which always has fresh flowers laid just in front of it. In one of the stories told during our visit, it was described that the Russians had made plans to demolish this church because it was not stable -- it had been originally built above the intersection of 3 rivers / canals which made the foundation very unstable for a structure this size. Those plans were put aside because just a few days before it was to be demolished, the Germans had declared war on, and invaded, Russia during WWII in June 1941. Were it not for that fortuitous timing - for better or for worse I suppose in the grander scheme of things - this amazing church would be lost forever. Move to the outside of the church and you get lost in its architecture, its colors, and its unique characteristics. There isn't one church, landmark, monument, or building that remotely resembles this one with its colorful onion-shaped rooftop features. This is certainly a MUST SEE if you ever had one."

Opposite is a market where there are hundreds of Russian dolls, chess sets and other paraphernalia for sale. The gardens behind are also worth a visit. Don't dare to walk on the grass!"

The church was decimated first by the Soviets, who vandalized the building and used it as a storage facility, and even more by German bombardment during World War II's 900 day Siege of Leningrad. There is a very interesting display showing the decades of restoration work which was done structurally and to restore the magnificent mosaics. When I went there, I was moved by a group of young Russian children on a school excursion, taking photos and completely enthralled by the beauty. . . The church is located on Griboyedov Canal, named after the author of one of the funniest Russian plays of the 19th Century. Gotta love a country that names streets and canals after literary figures."

Even though it was completed in 1907, its architecture is in the style of medieval Russian with classic onion domes and beautiful coloring. It also has more mosaic tiles than any other church in the world - over 7500 square meters of mosaics. In the 1930s, the Communists almost tore it down, but no date was ever given so consequently, the tear down was forgotten. The church was restored in the 1980s.

It is located in the heart of the city and it was built by Alexander III in honour to his father, in the exact place where Alexander II was assassinated by a bomb.It might be over for some tastes but I think it is a nice example of Russian architecture that must be seen. Numerous domes, full of gold and other colours surrounded by also colourful carvings. Inside the church is as colourful and full of paintings in its walls as it is outside. The church is located by a canal and at the sunset the view is wonderful.Pay attention to the names, because the official name of this church is \"Cathedral of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ\", but if you ask for that name, probably no one will help you to find it, since the Split Blood is the way it is known in the town."

There was so much beauty inside I wish we had more time to look at everything."

After the Russian revolution in 1917, the church was ransacked and badly damaged. It was used as a temporary morgue and after the war used as a warehouse to store vegetables etc. It was reopened in 1997 after 27 years of restoration, and is a must see when visiting St Petersburg"

The church is built in the true Russian Orthodox style, with numerous towering onion shaped domes some of which are painted others covered in gold leaf. Its style is similar to the more famous St. Basil Cathedral in Moscow's Red Square. However, this church is located adjacent to one of St. Petersburg's canals and has a beautiful public garden on the other side. It is truly Russian in both interior and exterior detail. Rather than having painted interior walls, the iconic figures are all done in mosaic - truly magnificent. No visit to St. Petersburg is complete without visiting Spilled Blood."

We were in town on a cruise and only had two days to see as much of the city as possible so we booked a tours and this was the best stop of the 10 or 12 sites we visited. The church is iconic on the outside and is really what we think of when you hear the term \"onion domes\". Brightly colored, it stands out from the other buildings in the area and for us, looked like a beacon on in the skyline. The area around the church gets pretty congested with buses, cars and limos milling around and there were lots of people walking around but it wasn't overly difficult to get some good photos for the church. There is also a small market across the street for trinkets, and snacks. If you walk through the market to the end there is a bridge over a canal that has a good view of the church.Inside the church is amazing. The detail and sheer amount of mosaics will take your breath away. Photography is allowed and there is some natural light but it is somewhat difficult to get great photos unless you have a fast lens or an extra flash. Plus it was very crowded making getting enough distance to compose photos well. Still, it is one of the places you have to see when in town."

In fact, this is an excellent church that adopts many styles inside. There are some great gift shops selling icons, etc. in the interior and words simply can't do justice to the outside. One of the more amazing things we found about this particular church were the shell marks on the outside marking its place in history. Watch for pick pockets on the outside."

It was closed in the early 1930\u2019s in danger of demolition before being used in WWII as a temporary morgue. Subsequently it was used as a vegetable warehouse. Then to add to its colourful history in the 1960\u2019s they found an unexploded WWII bomb in the cuppola. It\u2019s clear that this church was meant to survive \u2013 and is well worth a visit. At 250 rubles per adult it\u2019s cheap! Be awestruck by its magnificence \u2013 from the marble to the mosaics to the glorious wrought chandeliers."

As a result, I did not enter the Church (most reviews say that best part of this church is the exterior, and the exterior can be enjoyed for free).I chose to spend my cash at the St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow (which looks better on the outside, has so much more history than this, and is less discriminatory).Still, if you're not going to Moscow, and/or you feel that it may be worth paying to enter at least one stunning looking church, let this be the one."

We must have taken 100+ photos of this museum, it was absolutely incredible in the afternoon sunlight as we approached from Prospect Nevsky. The church is now a museum, so dress code isn't an issue. The museum charges a fee, and credit cards are accepted. The inside of the museum is literally covered from floor to ceiling with stone mosaics, and the artistry is amazing. Leave time to view the range of mosaics as you wander around the church. The stone pieces at the sides of the altar area are also unusual and amazing. We would highly recommend a visit. Note that a small market is across the road from the entrance to the museum."

When I toured the old Soviet Union we visited Leningrad (now St Petersburg) and I saw the exterior all in scaffolding and was told by the soviet guide it was under restoration (but later found out it was like that for years) and when I went inside it had been gutted and was being used as a warehouse. This was back in 1984. Near the top of my list for revisits are Kiev, and of course St Petersburg. Even then the Hermitage was awesome but the summer palace had been blown up by the retreating Nazi army so only partly restored. Credit must be given to the Soviet government as far as restoration is concerned. What they elected to restore was done with great vigor and authenticity Next visit was summer of 2012 and saw the Church once again functioning as a Russian Orthodox church and the Summer palace with its wonderful fountains all restored."

As it's only a small church there isn't much to see but it is worth a look. I would say that the outside rivals the inside in some ways. Come on a late summer's evening and enjoy the vision of the onion dome spires against a sunset.

But there is no problem in lack of amazement in this church. the audioguides help you further understand the symbolism of this church. Dont know if it is myth, but I was told by someone that Russia used the money they got for Alaska to build this place. The mosaics are so beautiful as is the floor patterns. It is a worthy shrine also for Alexander who had the blood spilled on the site. History might have been much different if he had lived and been allowed to continue his reforms for the people that he started. I would have loved to have stayed much longer but our bus was not going to wait for us."

In 1861 he freed the Russian serfs (peasants, who were almost enslaved to their owners) from their ties to their masters . However, during the second half of his reign Alexander II grew wary of the dangers of his system of reforms, having only barely survived a series of attempts on his life, including an explosion in the Winter Palace and the derailment of a train. Alexander II was finally assassinated in 1881 by a group of revolutionaries, who threw a bomb at his royal carriage. The church was built on the spot where the Emperor was mortally wounded. The church was built between 1883 and 1907 and was officially called the Resurrection of Christ Church (a.k.a. The Church of Our Savior on Spilled blood). The view of the church from Nevsky Prospekt is absolutely breathtaking."

There are beautiful mosaics everywhere you look. The floor itself is a visual feast. If you can, go with a guide who can provide the story and history of events regarding the church. It will add another dimension to what you see."

We were there just after this and the church was relatively quiet. When we exited there were lengthy queues building up and a number of tourist coaches starting to arrive, which could have ruined the serene atmosphere inside.Once in, the interior of the cathedral is equally as stunning as the exterior. The mosaics and artwork stretch from floor to ceiling. There is not a bland or dull space inside the entire building. A definite must see when in the city."

That was a nice contrast to most of the other cathedrals where frescoes seemed to be the main decoration. Frescoes fade more easily, and they have to be kept in dark settings to stay in good conditions. Mosaics don't have these disadvantages so they're still vibrant and can be seen in full light."

The striking colours and architecture hit you, as soon as you spot it, took various pics at different angles, because you can walk all around it as it is set in the middle of a cross-section. On the one side is a long busy road which heads towards the Nevsky Project-the largest and most popular street in the city; towards the back of the church is a small market area, where you can buy all your souvenirs at good fair prices- baboushkas in all sizes, different ceramic plates depicting St Petersburg themes, fridge magnets, keyrings etc etc and they also take euro! You really get a little of the \"feel\" of Russia here, and there is also an enclosed park next to the markets, where you enter through the gates and can go in and have a wonder around, with a river running on the side of it. A small church is across from the park, where there were many many weddings taking place while we waited for our tour bus to pick us up, as we were on a cruise and St Petersburg one of our ports of call..."

The Church has never been used for a religious service. It is surprisingly small on the inside, and expect to be given a pair of plastic overshoes if the weather outside has caused messy shoes."

Apart from its fairytale look on the outside, the interior is stunning. Everything is decorated in mozaics instead of murals so that it looks very fresh and the colours are vibrant. The style is also very interesting as even though done in the 18th century, it's very comic-book-like. It appealed to me and I think this church is a great place to take your kids to, as the mozaics from the New Testament will speak out to them. The have a very contemporary feel. The rest of the interior is equally fascinating - the Italian marble on the floor and the iconostais' made from semi-precious stones. Overall a must see.Now a little deliberation on the English audio-guide. Do not take it if you are pressed for time! It makes the tour last 42 minutes and it's mostly to a very specific naration by what I presume is a Russian speaker who tries to do the British English and speaks unnervingly slow with large pauses between single words and sentence intonation clearly more natural to Slavic languages. It gets half of the playing time to get used to and is kind of annoying. Thankfully the Church is an amazing experience itself so it does not prevent me from giving it the best possible rating."

In addition to the beautiful architecture (Russian style) and location (next to a canal and the Summer Garden), it has a historic annecdote attached, like many places in St. Petersburg. Alexander II was killed on that spot. Donations from people of all classes around Russia (Alexander II had abolished serfdom). The murderes were soon arrested, and in the same building where that happened, Dostoievsky was laying on his death bed, but that is a different story...The church never actually was inaugurated. During World War II it was badly damaged, and was restored only after the end of the Soviet Union."

The interior is quite possible the best of any church in Christendom, Unique and beautiful. . This Russian-style church was built on the spot where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated In St.Petersbug. The church was built between 1883 and 1907 and was officially called the Resurrection of Christ Church (a.k.a. The Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood ). The construction of the church was almost entirely funded by the Imperial family and thousands of private donations. Both the interior and exterior of the church is decorated with incredibly detailed mosaics, designed and created by the most prominent Russian artists of the day . Most of the buildings in St.Petersburg are classical in style and the whole city has an Imperial feel to it but his marvelous church is like something from a different planet. With its colourful Onion Bulb Domes and mosaics on the exterior it could very easily not work but all of the pieces fit beautifully to make a very imposing building. If you are impressed by the exterior you can only be blown away by the stunning interior. The interior was designed by some of the most celebrated Russian artists of the day . An elaborate shrine was constructed on the exact place of Alexander's death, garnished with topaz, lazurite and other semi-precious stones.The church contains over 7,500 square meters of mosaics - according to its restorers, more than any other church in the world. The intricately detailed mosaics depict biblical scenes and figures, with fine patterned borders setting off each picture. The mosaics are quite simply magnificent, in no other church interior anywhere is there sure splendor with every inch covered in priceless beauty and stunning icons ."

You can get some truly awesome photos from the nearest bridge up towards Dom Knigi/Nevsky Prospekt. It looks amazing from every angle though. I've seen newly-weds come to get photos by the nearby canal in summer, across from the Matryoshka markets where there's also a postcard-worthy view.

Even if you are feeling very church-weary (as can easily happen when traveling in Russia), the Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood is special and different. The outside, of course, is lovely and is deliberately reminiscent of St Basil's in Moscow. Unlike St Basil's, however, the inside is the hero. The inside consists of an incredibly ornate mosaic, which covers all of the walls and the ceiling. It is absolutely spectacular and has clearly been lovingly restored since WWII, when I believe it was used to store weaponry. Do visit this deconsecrated church. It is a true work of art and is stunning. It is also not very big, so it won't take you long to take it all in."

After suffering severe damage and neglect it underwent a 27 year restoration and was reopenned in 1997. Today the Russian Orthodox church has 7,500 square meters of outstanding mosaics which depict biblical scenes and figures. The art has a martyrdom theme which commerates the place Alexander II was assassinated in March 1881.Various shades of marble and gilding further enhance the interior. The church is open Thursday through Tuesday and is closed on Wednesday. Hours are a little unusual (11am-7pm). It is about $10 USD (300 rubles) and a good hour allows you to inspect all the church has to offer. The use of cameras and camcorders is a additional fee.There is a shrine to Alexander II made of topaz, lazurite and semi-precious stones.The onion domes and 16th-17th century architecture reflect the fact that it was inpired by the St. Basil Cathedral on Red Square in Moscow. Resting on the banks of the Griboedov Canal, there is easy access to the church from the Nevsky Prospekt (the main street) metro station. The Russian Museum is a short walk and is wortwhile seeing as well."

We paid about 400 rubles each to enter; there was good security and crowd control. Needed to be as the weekend of August 25 was the busiest of the season, some 13 cruise ships were docked in St. Petersburg! We weren't on a cruise ship so missed most of the bus loads of tourists. There were still a great number of people inside but the crowds pass through quickly. If you're the kind of person who enjoys browsing and taking their time, find a quiet corner and move around from there. The mosiacs are outstanding, as is the renovation of the exterior. What a wonderful thing for Russia and the world that this church as never completely destroyed during Soviet times. Be careful of pickpockets while you're distracted by the mosiacs inside the church! Our little backpack front zipper was unzipped while we were appreciating the art - nothing stolen as we only had paper tissues and gum inside!"

We have just returned from a 3 week visit to Russia which was marred by a gang of pickpockets operating on the street on the opposite side of the canal from The Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood. The Church and its mosaics were stunning and not to be missed.We left the church and crossed the footbridge to the opposite bank of the canal. There was a musician playing on the bridge obstructing the path and a man opposite him with a rolled up umbrella so you had to squeeze between them to get past. I now believe they were part of the gang that robbed me.After leaving the bridge I turned left and was immediately accosted by three men purporting to sell large post cards and a map. The man with the umbrella also appeared I tried to push past them and they became violent pushing and jostling me against the wall. I pushed them away and noticed they had unzipped my breast pocket I immediately re-zipped it and they again unzipped it this time more obviously. I checked my pocket to find that they had taken my cash and were now trying to get my wallet, cards and passport at this point I shouted that I was being robbed and the ran off.So PLEASE, PLEASE be very careful in this area they are very professional they know what they are doing and it is very quick and would not stop at harming you.We were a group of nine and are experienced travelers but could not stop this happening so be very very wary, keep your belongings safe only take with you what you need.Enjoy your visit to the church."

Interestingly we saw a lot of brides and grooms coming to the areas behind the cathedral. It is a stunning park.

If I'm not mistaken, it has 9 onion-shape doms. Quite a lot of work was put into it, including mosaics. Built in honor of 19 century tsar Alexander II, killed by terrorists devoted to revolution, although this tsar abolished serfdom, gave lots of political freedom to people etc. Back then, as it is now, terrorists did not have any consideration...The church was not intended for regular services & that's probably why I did not feel this powerful positive energy inside. I still recommend visiting it but don't buy any souvenirs inside, they are overpriced."

Since St. Petersburg was built on swampy ground, there is a lot of humidity...and therefore the use of oil paintings on the walls and ceilings of the churches in this area is avoided since the paint will fade. Instead, they use thousands of little bits of ceramic tiles and create mosaic frescos on the walls and ceilings....and you have to see it to believe it. Truly beautiful!"

There was the manger scene, Jesus and the woman at the well from John, Chapter 4, there was Abraham and Sarah receiving news of Isaac from the three angels. There was the Mary being told she would give birth to the Saviour. Once we saw one, it became a hunt to find another. I was blessed beyond my wildest imagination. I was told that in some of the bigger churches during the Lenin-Stalin era; they painted over these and used them as stables and storage houses. Smaller churches were destroyed. Then under Boris Yeltsin, after the Soviet Union broke up, they began restoring the churches. What a gift to the world."

My husband and I do not think it is the #1 thing in the area to see, though. Both the State Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace, and Peterhof Palace and Garden are bigger and better places to see in the Saint Petersburg area. The highly unusual name for the church is due to the fact Tsar Alexander II was assassinated at this site. It contains over 7,500 square meters / 80,700 square feet of mosaics. It is definitely worth paying admission to see the inside of this impressive structure. The artwork, floors, inlaid stones and mosaics are something you will not see in many places. Many photographs of the impressive mosaics were taken by us.It should be worth noting that our tour guide mentioned this is a high pickpocket area. Make sure your valuables are secure while visiting this beautiful Baroque and Neoclassical (with some romantic nationalism) structure. You want your visit to this magnificent piece of architecture to be a great experience."

This can happen anywhere, of course, but I must mention it here, since our Russian guide told us after the incident that things are particularly bad at this site.

Far too many pictures were taken, but this Russian church is the perfect size for close-up wow photography. Unlike the vast, extraordinary expanse of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul with its spectacular mosaics, this church doesn't require professional equipment and a neck brace to take fab pictures. It's intimate and spectacular, with the mosaics close enough for detailed ogling. Definitely a highlight of our St Petersburg visit.Don't by-pass the gift shop just inside the entrance. It's full of delightful souvenirs vastly better than the dubious and often over-priced offerings on the streets. If you have Catholic (or even agnostic) friends, there are affordable icons, cross pendants (very nice selection), other religious and vaguely religious items that make very Russian gifts. I would say, quite an attraction on its own!"

Unfortunately most days here, including today, are cloudy for this would be even more spectacular in the sun. We rented the tape to hear as we went around inside but it was of limited interest. It talks about many different things in the church but you have no idea where they are. Photography is allowed inside, but no flash. The entire inside of the church is mosaic panels, not a square inch is left uncovered. Mosaid was used becaumuch more durable than other coverings. The interior is equally as beautiful as the exterior, just completely different. This church ranks right up there with St. Basils Cathedral in Moscow as one of the manmade wonders of the world."

The inside was wrecked by Stalin and the second world war and only very recently restored to its original glory.The inside is mostly mosaics and granite carvings which either hold your interest or don't. One complaint is, we bought the audio guide and the commentary had very little connection with the 'stations' to visit.Visit the outside for a photo opportunity but save yourself some money and give the inside a miss."

Go there, you will love it! However ...The front plaza is a mass of humanity. Tourists from all over the world and unfortunately a few pickpockets too. I am a careful traveler. There is nothing in my pockets or on my person that can be easily removed by the slick of hand, or so I thought! I was carrying my Mark ii Canon with its $1500 lens around my neck hanging in front of me. (On a braided metal reenforced strap.) I was approached in the crowd tall blond guy trying to sell me (i thought) a calendar. He held it parallel to the ground and pushed it into my stomach above the camera. Instinctively, without thought I roughly pushed him away. He went into a fake \"hurt my leg stance\" and his partner approached on my other side. I quickly kept walking away. A few minutes later the lens fell off my camera. Fortunately it wasn't hurt. It did however teach me a lesson or two.One, they are very good and very fast and two, Canon has a button on the side of the lens which when pushed and the lens is 1/4 turned at the same time it can be gone. Just as easy as that. If you have a Canon try it. It is amazing how easy it is. Stay awake people! Hope this helps. It can happen anywhere and none of this is intended to detract from the Church of the Spilled blood. It is more than worth a visit."

Just doesn't seem possible that buildings that this were built & then you go inside and view the whole interior which is covered with mosaics. Each mosaic piece is about 1cm - amazing. It has been restored and a display is available showing the work involved. The building was even bombed - so tragic that that happened. But, this wonder is standing so bolding in St. Petersburg and open to the public. Left there with so much gratitude that I was able to visit such a precious site."

One would be amaze just walking towards it on the street, and once you are in front of it, it's simple incredible. Make sure you have a zoom camera or a pair of binoculars so you can see the details high up around the onion domes. The interior will seem a bit smaller than expected but it's absolutely amazing nonetheless. The entire interior is covered in mosaic tiles depicting biblical stories, and by the end of the day your neck will hurt from looking up the entire time. But it's worth the pain. Try to go during the week to avoid big crowds.Another little thing I liked about the place was the small section that showed pictures of the restoration process from when the building was severely damaged by the wars.

It seems that Russian love color. You can find a huge collection of colors inside the church. Its architect decorated inside walls with small part of mosaic. The best thing is that it is located very close to the Nevsky Prospekt metro station. If U want to visit the inside U should know they don\u2019t let U in on Wednesday."

The highlights are the location just a short stroll of the of the main street. This adds to the experience as you approach the church to appreciate the workmanship in its architecture. Upon entering (a little cumbersome as we had to put on little plastic booties to protect the carpet due to the winter) the detail and respect to the images are sensational with smaller mosaic pieces constructing murals like nothing I have seen ever.

The exterior of the church has to be one of the most photographed buildings in the world, so I won't dwell on it, but the interior is every bit as magnificent as the exterior, soaring high above the crowds (The place is packed) and completely covered with some of the most amazing paintings, frescoes, and architecture I've ever been privileged to lay eyes on.

The breathtaking exterior suggests perfection (in Russian-style churches),while the interior is a stunning combination of partially gilded mosaics,marble iconostasis andsemiprecious stones (Rodonit,jasper etc) chapels. Therefore,the overall impressionis of stunning masterpiece. After visiting this church,both outside as well as inside,you feel overwhelmed by beauty and luxury.

I was especially impressed with the renovations, which were masterfully done. This place has been spiffed up and perhaps has never looked better. The mosaics were beautiful, but I was even more impressed with the carvings of marble and other precious rocks, some of which were so well-done that I nearly cried.

You can't miss the colorful onion domes and ornate facade of the church - they stand out in a sea of Style Moderne and classical buildings like a Faberge egg, a colorful jewel-box (try the view from the Field of Mars for a slightly different approach).Inside, every surface is covered in tiny colored tiles, millions of them, in mosaics of biblical figures and stories. At first glance, if I hadn't known that they were mosaics, I would have said they were paintings, they were that detailed. The work is beautiful. These are not the clunky mosaics that I'm used to seeing, blocky and brightly-colored, these are subtle and finely-detailed and crafted so carefully they are dazzling.Also fascinating is the history of the church (which is not an ancient one) and the restoration work on the exterior and interior after WWII -- some of the \"before\" pictures are ghastly, and looking around at the gorgeous colors and images today, it's hard to imagine the work that went into restoring the mosaics to what we see now. That's one of the things I had to keep reminding myself of, in many of the buildings in St. Petersburg, is that what we see now is relatively recent -- the rebuilding efforts in some of these buildings to repair the damage done 70 years ago is almost unimaginable. Make sure to stop outside and look at the beautiful wrought-iron railings around the church. A guide is not required in the church, although you might want one just to hear a bit about the history of the building itself, and frankly, it's hard to avoid the loud drone of tour guides in various languages as they lead their little herd of tourists around the interior of the church. Just tag along on one of those, if you want some help deciphering things. Otherwise, stick to the edges of the church to get the best view of the walls and ceiling and avoid getting trampled!Absolutely recommended--I can't think of any place that compares."

People complain about the cost (about $10), but once I set foot inside this church it was worth every penny and more. The amount of detail in the mosaics that cover nearly every part of this churches inside are truly breath-taking. It's hard to put into words the artistic achievement of this church, and it's certainly the most gorgeous I've ever seen. A large section of the floor is roped off and that's where the Russian Czar Alexander II was assassinated and to the side is a gated shrine constructed from carved marble in his honor. There's also a display of sad, but interesting pictures showing the damage inflicted upon the church during WWII. Between the amazing mosaics telling/showing the story of Jesus Christ, to the historical importance of this church its bewildering that the communist wanted to destroy it, but I'm glad they didn't cause now its a work of art and significance that all should marval at, at least once. The tour groups/crowds can get a little overwhelming inside, so its strongly recommended that you avoid the busy times. Go early or late, but no later then 6 pm, cause it closes at 7 pm. This is a place you really want to take in, without the noise and confusion of large crowds that also make it hard to maneuver around inside. Also, they might charge you more if you want to video or take detailed pictures, so keep that equipment hidden unless you don't mind the extra cost."

It is fairly young \u2013 its construction was completed in 1907, but its design imitates the style of 16th-century Russian churches. The church was built right on the spot where Tsar Alexander II had been assassinated in 1881, and there is the canopy inside the church put up over the pavement on which his royal blood was spilled.Inside, the church looks as stunning as it does outside: Its walls and columns are faced with semi-precious stones and mosaics sketched by renowned 19th-century Russian artists \u2013 the total size of the mosaics is 7,000 square meters! The floor and the main iconostasis are made of different-colored Italian marble. As you move around the church, look at the mosaics on the walls which feature different legends from the New Testament, and make sure you don\u2019t miss the two mosaic icons decorating the two side iconostases, the icon of St Alexander (Alexander II\u2019s patron saint) and the temple icon of Resurrection \u2013 these are real masterpieces.The church is opened from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. in summer. You can buy entrance tickets inside (the booking office outside is for Russian residents), and will receive a short description of the church in your desired language together with your ticket. The tickets are quite expensive \u2013 320 rubles (about USD 11) but it is still worth a visit. You can also hire an audio guide.The church is not big (it used to be a royal church in old days), and tends to get extremely crowded with groups of visitors towards the middle of the day, so you will enjoy your visit more if you get there in the morning or towards the end of the day (the booking office closes at 6:00 but the church itself closes at 7:00)."

Visited as part of an excursion whilst on a Baltic Cruise - it is interesting in that this is one of the few 'Russian' buildings in what is a very European city. Thought it was so attractive on the outside, but my jaw did actually drop when I saw the breath taking mosaics on the inside. Interesting also to learn about the history of the building during the Soviet period. A must see on any trip to this fascinating city."

Just completed a trip/cruise including Moscow & St.Petersburg, some fabulous building in both cities - but the Church of the Resurection (crrect name) is fantastic on the outside and fabuolous on the inside - although it is by European standards quite modern, (Obviously to US citizens it will be 'ancient') it is well organised for tourism, central in the city, pleasant outdoor bars/cafes outside towards Nevsky Prospekt and a reasonable collection of 'touristy' souvenir stalls in a small market on the other side. It currenty costs about \u00a38 to go in, cheaper than most English cathedrals etc and certainly more impressive. Closed Wednesdays so it seems."

The exterior of the church is beautiful and the interior mosaics are stunning! If you are on a tight budget then walk around the exterior, however if you are able to spring it pay the $$ to go inside. The mosaics are really fantastic! You are allowed to take photos inside but without a flash.There is also a great little market full of treasurers across the street from the entrance to the Church."

            "review": "Wonderful mosaics. This rather \"new\" cathedral (just above 100 years) is really a museum today, with only occasionally religious services related to the purpose of the church - the death of Tsar Alexander II. The church is totally covered, from rooftop to the floor, in wonderful mosaics. You can see everything in 45 min easily, but in the same time, if you want to look deeper into the works - you probably would need to stay for days. There is different entrance fees for Russian citizens and foreigners. You are allowed to take pictures as long as you don't use flash and/or tripod. In the entrance fee there is a 35 min guided tour included - but only in Russian! There is audio guides to rent for an additional fee. A small souvenir shop is also inside the church/museum."

I agree with all the other reveiwers this church is really worth a visit - it is as impressive inside with it's fabulous mosaics as it is outside with its lovely coloured onion domes.The correct ttile is the Cathedral of the Resurrection although it is known locally as The Chruch of Our Saviour on the Spilled Blood. This name refers, as other revewers say, to the fact that it was built on the spot where Alexander III was mortally wounded in 1881. The Bell tower was built to protrude out over the canal and marks the spot where Allexander II was murdered.Although the church was practically destroyed in the 1930's it has been restored magnificantily and is well worth a visit."

            "review": "Stunning and a must-see. This is one of those places that you see in photos, and yet no photo can capture the \"WOW\" factor when you see it. It's only about 100+ years old, and yet it has that permanence and stately quality that makes it feel like it's been around for a long time. The fact that it commemorates the assassination of Alexander II in 1881 is recalled by the name of the church (Church built on Spilled Blood), and by the shrine inside which marks the spot where the second bomb exploded, mortally wounding the tsar. But it is also the Church of the Risen Christ, which explains the exuberence that you feel inside the church, with its vivid (slightly over-the-top) mosaics and icons. Even the floor under the center dome (set off by a cordon) is vivid and colorful. During July 2009, when I was there, it was crowded, but you can still enjoy the church's many delights and its historical connections. Do see it, along with the Cathedral of Peter and Paul and Saint Isaac's Cathedral, among so many other memorable churches in Saint Petersburg."

I imagine a lot of people walking along Nvskiy Prospekt stop and look at this breathtaking church, perched along the banks of a canal and think that it is quite something. But only if you go inside will you appreciate what a true masterpiece it is. Easily the best church in St. Petersburg in my opinion. The mosaics are fabulous."

Although no longer a practicing church it is really worth the visit to take in the amazing work that craftsmen have done on this church. The colours are bright and cheerful. The whole place is quite dazzling. It was really a fantastic thing to see."

Inside every square inch was filled with brightly colored mosiac tiles and paintings. Outside the multi-colored onion-domed towers soared upward. A truly breathtaking building. A must see in St. Petersburg."
