Just outside the ferry terminals and busy street area of Playa Del Carmen is a public park with this gorgeous structure. If you stand back about 50 feet and peer through the opening, you can see the stunning and beautiful Caribbean Sea. Kids were playing, vendors were setting up for the day's ferry rides or local attractions, all in this safe and charming park area."

It is entitled \u201cPortal Maya 2012\u201d. It celebrates the Mayan calendar and the date of December 21st. 2012. The sculpture was designed by artist Arturo Taravez who is from Guanajuato, Mexico. It has since become an iconic image of Playa Del Carmen. It is a beautiful work of art that you need to see up close to appreciate it."

I visited when I got off the ferry from Cozumel. It was a busy Saturday evening. Local vendors selling snacks/water. A group of dancers did a short free performance displaying the Mayan culture. It was nice to see the people so proud of their ancestry. There is a free public beach, some restaurants near by and a small playground for children. Unfortunately there is a McDonalds about 2 blocks from here. Its a must prior or after the ferry to Cozumel!"

            "review": "The best part of 5th Ave- The Park!. We walked to this park which is right beside the ferry dock. Accordingly, 5th Avenue is the hub of the town and is a pedestrian mall, a shoppers paradise from the low end to the ultra expensive in the shopping experience. From designer shops to the tacky nik nak shops, this spot is prime. At 5 pm we were lucky to catch a show - a performance but two groups. The first was the \"Tower of the Voladores\". Daring Mexican men launch themselves up a very high pole ( 80 feet high) headfirst and making a slow spiraling descent to the plaza below. Each one is suspended by ropes round their ankles. The Mayan dancers at the base of the arc are superb in performing ritualistic dance. This adds a touch of true culture in an area that is so commercialized. Oh, and this event in the park is a complete contrast to the vibe of 5th Avenue. Love it."

Parque Fundadores sits right on the beach and commemorates the Founders of Playa del Carmen and is a significant historical location within the city. It\u2019s one of the primary focal points of the downtown draw of tourists from around the world, acting as the epicenter of 5th Avenue and Juarez, as well as the ferry out to the island of Cozumel. There\u2019s your traditional street vendors hawking food, as well as a children\u2019s playground, plus the primary sculpture that fills up they skyline in just about every photo shot taken in this area. There are also several events that take place throughout the day, from the acrobats who scale the pole and slowly lower themselves on ropes as they spin in a giant circle, to the Maya street artists who paint themselves in ritual costumes to perform for the masses. It is also unique in Playa del Carmen in that it is the first beach to feature handicap/disabled access, although beyond that it is your typical tourist beach in that it\u2019s generally full of the average tourist types smoking cigarettes and kicking back a few beers in the sand, taking photos, maybe playing some volleyball or strolling along, and a few people camped out taking in the sun if happens to be out for the day."

I packed up my gear and headed down the beach toward the ferry terminal. I came upon this really cool (HUGE) sculpture and also noticed there were no beach clubs here, just folks lying in chairs and towels. I plopped my stuff down and went for a swim. Great waves here for body surfing. Clean water, no seaweed or litter, and you can hear some of the music from a nearby club depending on how close you are. It's public, free and lovely. Lots of room even on the weekends. I ended up here more than our beach club for the past 2 weeks.

I was recommended Mexico by many friends raving about the beaches of Playa, tobe honest Australian beaches beat this section of coastline hands down. 5th Ave is busy, but keep your wits about you regarding shopping and bagging a bargin. I found going into the larger supermarket- type tourist shops better, fixed prices and you don't have to barter. Food is good and great deals to be found. Nice social environment. Be careful not to be scammed about taxi's to return you to your hotel, fix the price BEFORE you get in. 5th ave to Xcaret area should be approx $15 USD."

One night there was a Mayan fire show that we sat and enjoyed with locals and tourists alike. It was really nice to sit and watch with kids playing in the area and people hanging out eating ice cream or fruit from the nearby fruit vendors, kind of reminded me of old ice cream socials in my community on fourth of july as a kid. Another afternoon we wandered by and stopped to watch Mayan pole flyers performing. Just a great little gathering place to catch different things happening at different times. The fruit stands nearby are amazing too. I went to them almost daily on the trip to buy a cup of fresh cut fruit assortments to have as breakfast at the hotel the next morning since we were leaving too early every morning for dive trips to enjoy the hotel's breakfast. The fruit was always really fresh and tasty as well as really cheap."

A great place to have an ice cream cone or a snack while you sit back and watch the traditional ceremonies and other performances. Be aware that the locals know this is a spot where tourists relax and are preoccupied with the performances so make sure and keep your valuables secure. Since. phones and cameras disappear in seconds. I was at Playa about six years ago and since then I noticed the theft has gotten much worse. Somehow in Playa my credit card info was electronically pick pocketed. I did not use a credit card sleeve protector and I found out the thieves can buy a devise online for under $100.00 that picks up credit card information right out of your pocket from up to 25 feet away without even knowing it. I was also surprised at how often storekeepers and gas stations tried to steal by trying to tell me the wrong dollar/peso conversion. So, enjoy but be smart and alert! Thumbs up if you found this helpful. Go forth and vacation!"

The statue at the east end of the parque serves as a sort of window to the sea, and frames the view of the Caribbean perfectly. It looks particularly beautiful at night with a full moon lighting the sky and reflecting off the water. Take a few minutes to check this area out, and most evenings you'll find music and dancing in the Mayan custom, including performers dressed in ornate headdresses."

They know as well as I do that they all have pretty much the same stuff, supplied by the same companies with money paid to the same organizers. I just got plain tired of hearing the same calls over and over again.Being on fifth avenue on Halloween was a very unique experience and a good one in that there were so many people the vendors really couldn't do their calls and target you directly. Staying in the middle of the street also helped keep them at bay.I don't think I will ever be able to fully explore the avenue as I don't walk as well as I used to so we only got about 8 blocks from the Playacar Palace and returned.

Try to haggle with the store owners, they are used to it. We mostly shopped in the bigger stores because I hate haggling, and enjoy seeing the prices right on the items so that I can mentally decide if I want the item or not. There are so many restaurants to choose from, and this is where you can also buy some tours from that are cheaper than the resorts. Overall I had a very interesting day here."

You even get wafts of smell while walking down Quinta Avenida.If you are prepared and aren't that sensitive to smell, then this is worth a visit. Otherwise, you may wish to reconsider staying outside of Playa Del Carmen (Cozumel is an option) and making day trips. Just be sure you ask your hotel about any smells from the seaweed."
