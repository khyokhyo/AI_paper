            "review": "These are stunning beaches, but have some downsides. There are 4 Clifton beaches, each attracts slightly different types of visitors, so research a bit and select one. All are stunning, with white sand, huge rocks, blue blue water and are protected from the wind. This is a big deal in Cape Town where the southeaster blows for most of summer. The southeaster often/mostly exceeds 30 kph and sometimes exceeds 50kph, and for fairly limited periods much higher than that. BUT at almost any time, the Clifton beaches are virtually wind free. Parking is a huge problem, so either get dropped and fetched (uber would work well here) or park early. And expect a fair walk to the beach. There are reasonable facilities on all the beaches, including toilets, chair and umbrella hire at most times. But there is one important downside which may or may not be crucial for you. You really cannot expect to spend much time in the water as it is freezing. Well, almost. Clifton is on the cold Atlantic side and I have been there (in the past - last time I was there I did not even try to swim) when, after lying in the sun for a few hours and getting toasty, roasty and hot, I decided to have a cooling swim. Big mistake. As I walked in, I instantly lost all feeling in my feet, legs; by the time I was about knee deep I had changed my mind about swimming. But dont take my word for it, you try. Just dont equate sunny South Africa and beautiful beaches with warm water. Well not in Cape Town anyway, and definitely not at Clifton or any Atlantic Ocean beaches."

As the numbers of the beaches increase the bikini's and swimwear gets smaller. On beach \"4\" it looks like models and a few yachts were anchored in the bay. No dogs are allowed on this beach. Beach \u201d4\" was definitely the most beautiful one. The beach numbers are clearly marked on street level. Quite a number of stairs down to each one so don't take too many heavy items with you. Vendors come by with cool boxes. On beaches \"3 and 4\" you can rent a beach umbrella and beach chairs."

This is the happening spot of Cape Towns beaches. Mother nature rules here and you're pretty far from any commercial restaurants or bars. The closest place is a toilet, if you're lucky. The gods and godess of the mother city grace these beaches. Choose the right one and you might see the cool earthy people of the Cape (there's 4 beaches).TIps:The beaches can be accessed from any part of the central city by public transport \" MyCity\" bus system. Look for the Clifton route.Take lots of fluid and eats. There's no shops on these beaches and the Capetonians are pretty much laid back, so we eat and drink on the beaches (no alcohol, it against the law to prevent drowning)."

Set amongst some of the most valuable real estate in Africa, the beaches are filled with powder white sand and gorgeous (but cold) waters. But Clifton beaches can get crowded and they are a mission to climb up and down to, so not great for a family. We found Camps Bay much more convenient and offering about the same sand and water (also with a crowd - but at least easy to get in and out)."

The sand was quite soft and powder like. To access the beach, there are many steps down and it can become tiring when climbing up. So, if one has a problem, then it is better to avoid this beach. One can also go to the Camp's Bay beach which is as beautiful. Unfortunately cos of the small hills on the western side, we could not view the sunset. However, it was a pretty sight to look at the eastern side with the houses on the hill side lighted."

My son dragged his folks down the stairs to go watch the sun set on a recent visit to Cape Town. We have been going to Cape Town 2 to 3 times per year for the past 10 years or so. Never did we set foot on Clifton beaches till now. We have been missing out on the most peaceful, tranquil evening sunsets in the city. From now on it will be a must on every trip.We visited when there was some kind of tide coming in because apparently the beach was very small that evening, but it was not crowded, just sufficiently busy to be interesting and captivating. A pack of teenage girls played some game whilst couples trekked past dragging surfboards through the sand hugged by tired toddlers. Romantics huddled on rocks whilst other solitary figures enjoyed their own company. No one was in the water for obvious reasons. I had found the perfect beach! It was VERY relaxing and VERY beautiful."

We took a long walk around, taking in the sights, and dipped our toes in.Note that the water here was freezing, even during South Africa's summer.The best part about this beach was how few people were to be seen! In fact this is something of a trend that I've noticed in South Africa--the beaches here are really never crowded, there is only ever a few people wandering about so you can have plenty of room to yourself.

Clifton has none of this, after walking down a few stairs you feel like you are on a different planet, no noise from bars or restaurants, luscious soft white sand, and cold refreshing water to swim in. There is the odd vendor walking around selling drinks or ice cream but not enough to disturb your tranquil experience in the sun. If you are looking for a relaxing beach experience rather than a party, Clifton is for you, luckily Camps Bay is only a 2 minute drive away with bars and restaurants to suit anyone's needs once you've had enough relaxing on the beach."

Having travelled extensively around the world I am yet to find to find a set of public beaches which quite rival the exquisite setting of these unique pristine fine white sandy beaches. Set on the famed Atlantic Seaboard against a backdrop of some of the most expensive real estate properties in S. Africa these famous 4 beaches form alcoves with smooth weathered granite outcrop rocks acting as book end natural structures! IN fact there is a 5th beach which the locals refer to as `Moses' which is more secluded for those seeking a bit more privacy. The azure blue sea however is generally crisp and cold but always exhillirating and refreshing. During the summer vacation period the beaches are patrolled by resident life-guards; on occassion the seas can be rough with strong waves and currents and common sense should prevail. On most summer days the sea can be flat and enticing and one can also hire stand-up paddle boards enjoying a ride out to the anchored luxury yachts at Clifton 4th, The backdrop to Clifton is unparalelled from a beauty perspective with towering Lions Head Mountain set to the left and the Twelve Apostles to the right....you may even catch a glimse of Table Mountain nestled in the dip between the two mountianous settings. All in all a Must Do for tourists and up country visitors...you can hire lounger beds and umbrellas....enjoy this spectacular beach experience!"

Clifton beaches are numbered 1-4. Each one has a \"designated\" style of person. While they aren't written rules, the locals know that each one attracts different beach goers. One is more popular with families, another for the beautiful people, etc. When we were there the weather was gorgeous but the wind was outrageous. We were getting sandblasted. We should have known that when we looked down over the beach and no one was on it, that it was a bad day to go to the beach. Also, there aren't a lot of food options around that area if you are looking to spend the whole day on the beach. If you're prepared of all of this, then you're fine! I also wouldn't suggest Clifton for anyone who has problems with stairs. The stairs are uneven and steep in places. And while this was fine for us, I know that my parents might have had a tough time. All in all, it was a beautiful place where you could rent umbrellas and chairs, but make sure before you climb down the stairs that you check out the beach from the street level to see if anyone is there. It will give you an idea of the weather below."

The other beaches options are a topless one, a gay one and one for the types who think they have rockin' bodies or are rich and these descriptions are those of the locals not my words. ;) The positives of this beach is that it is clean and beautiful. The negative is that there are vendors from the beach itself who walk around all day long, literally every 60 seconds you will hear one of them say, \"ice cold water or soda, chocolate or vanilla lollies.\" Which apparently a lolly is an ice cream on a stick of sorts. They were COMPLETELY ANNOYING but they work for the beach are just trying to earn a living. I just wished they seriously didn't walk all over so much and constantly be shouting. They have plenty of lifeguards on duty and there are public bathrooms and public parking if you drove your own car. You can also rent an umbrella or chair. The beach gets very crowded later in the day, at least on the family beach so get there early to get a good spot!"

Lack of Gulf Stream and presence of Antarctic currents mean the water is freezing (!5-16\u00ba C i guess) but it's refreshing and tonic (I like cold water). If you're feeling brave, you can go for a swim (I'd recommend Clifton 4 because it's supervised and the waves are smaller) or just a walk along the beach with thigh-high water for a little detox (cold water is so much healthier ;) ) .I think just seeing them is worth it, and who knows, you might just catch a celebrity."

There is a man selling ice creams and chilled drinks but no bathroom. The water isn't warm as it's the Atlantic but it's bearable to cool off in and there is 1 fresh water shower to get rid of the salt. Swimmers beware there are submerged large boulders just beneath the surface which if a wave catches you unaware can seriously hurt you.Traveller tip all along that set of beaches including camps bay have rip currents which can be very strong. If you get caught in one do not panic,flow with it, then at your closest point to the beach swim in as they pull you out then die off. If you fight against it, use up all your energy fighting to get back to shore you will exhaust your self and end u potentially in more trouble. Take Heed !!"

I suggest hopping on the bus from sea point if that is where you staying.personally I prefer 4th beach as it has the least stairs. All 4 beaches have stairs and it gets hot very very hot. The beach is protected from wind so is the warmest in Cape Town. Beautiful clean powdery sand and a view which is in itself great. That does not include the view on the sand however with gorgeous people all over the show. The ocean is cold but it gets so hot in summer that a swim is definitely on. There are some facilities available such as loungers drinks etc. I would though suggest taking lots of sunscreen and water though.Fabulous beach where you can tan to your hears content"

The water can be extremely cold, so be prepared. Parking is almost impossible on a hot day, especially in Season, so be warned. Do not leave items on the beach unattended as they are likely to be stolen. I learnt the hard way! As you progress beyond Clifton there are many other beaches, such as Camp's Bay which are also really lovely, but if you are seeking warmer ocean water head out to Fishoek or Muizenburg."

Driving to Camps Bay from Sea point you can see part of the beach and if you are a tourist will probably drive on by as there is little parking on the road above. But if you keep driving there are parking lots of the left and on the sea side of the road steps leading down to the beach. Clifton is an affluent suburb and the area around Clifton beach has some of the most expensive properties in South Africa, unlike some overseas countries the beaches are not private so the poorer people can take a walk along them or just lie and take in the sun. I recommend Clifton 4th beach this is the one closest to Camps bay. this beach is the widest of all 4. In 2004 it was rated as one of the top 10 beaches in the world. The beach has the Blue flag status so it must be clean and up to standard. The beaches are separated by huge white granite boulders and some of the houses skirting the beach seem to grow out of the boulders. The sand is as white as it gets as its made from pure white granite that has been ground down over hundreds of years. Off shore there are large outcrops of white granite boulders 4 meters high and the smaller one have seals suntanning on them. and its a famous place for the rice and famous to moor their bay liners off. If you are there on a clear day you can see the cable car going back and forth from table mountain which towers over head. There are life savers on hand but if your a warm water person you wont need them the water is freezing! The day we were there only two tourists ventured into the waves. In summer just be warned there can be Blue bottle in the water or as the rest of the world knows them \"Portuguese men of war\" which is a type of jelly fish with a long tail with small stinging venom needles and can be very painful. There are no bars on the beach so bring your own food and drink. There are men's and ladies ablutions which are quite clean and don't smell like your usual beach ablutions. We visited in Autumn and the beach wasn't the busy but I believe in December it can become a bit over bearing with crowds."

The beach was quiet and calm, with just a few people around. The view is great and I enjoyed looking at all the amazing houses on the cliffs there. There is a shower and people renting chairs and umbrellas and selling water, soda, ice cream, beach toys and snacks, but they are not intrusive.

The cove keeps the wind out so you are able to enjoy a peaceful beach day. Clifton 3rd has parasols & lounge chairs for rent at a very reasonable price and you can bargain with them if you want several of each. Although the beach area is very small and there are a lot of people, it did not feel crowded. People are very considerate and respect each other's space. Several times we went to different beaches but would always leave after a few minutes to return to Clifton 3rd! There are bathrooms and showers and men walking around selling water and food if need. Also, the bus stop is right in front of the parking lot. My only negative experience was the traffic going home. We were there during New Years Eve so the roads were very busy. If we did not arrange for a taxi ahead of time, it was impossible to find an empty one. Even all the buses were filled to max capacity and could not stop. So if you're not driving, make sure you have a taxi drivers card, or call your hotel to arrange a pick-up 30-45min before you're ready to leave."

There are days when the water is warmer and swimming longer is pleasant but for most days a quick dip is all I can manage. The road is way up above the beach and there are lots of stairs to get down there - so if you don't like stairs go further along the road to Camps Bay beach rather. I love Clifton because you can't see or hear the traffic, you are surrounded by big boulders, houses of the lucky few who live there and greenery. When you walk on the dry sand do a forward stomp movement when you walk...the sand is so clean closer to the shore it actually squeaks. There is first, second, third and fourth beach. I've only ever been to third and fourth beach - it get jam packed in summer so go early. Changing rooms and toilets get progressively dirty through the day because of the crowds, I always take my own tissues coz often they will run out of loo paper, which really irritates me. ( I always need to know there's a loo nearby wherever I go coz liquids go straight through me) Ice lolly and cold drink sellers patrol the beach all day - so no need to pack your own, theirs is ice cold. Don't leave your things unattended - in SA, I hate to admit, opportunistic thieves are aplenty so always be vigilant- I usually use my bag as my pillow and put my shoes under the foot end of my towel. Your photos will look amazing coz most days the sea is turquoise or azure blue. You can get there on the MyCiti bus from town."

It's perfect for windy days as the beach is well sheltered by the large boulders. Cape Town can get extremely windy in Dec/Jan, so Clifton is a great spot to visit on the windy days! It can also be pricey - hiring an umbrella is about R40, and sun loungers are R60 each. There are no places to buy food, although vendors sell cold drinks and ice-creams on the beach."

The beaches are small and intimate.....fourth being bigger.....but the setting with private homes right in the sand and the enclosed space so beautiful....you gave to pack your food and drinks and go spend a day.

The crowd is pleasant and therefore it makes for a nice safe spot to have an evening picnic. There are 4 coves, called 1st - 4th Beach. On 4th Beach you will find public toilets and a shower outside. Since it's on the Atlantic side of of Cape Town, expect a rather chilly water temperature. Camps Bay with a nice array of Caf\u00e9's, Ice Cream Parlours and Restaurants is short drive away to the south, as is Bantry Bay and Green Point to the city side.

Six kilometers from cape town.There are 4 Clifton beaches, I visited number 4 (Supposedly the best) and was not impressed.You have to go down a track/stairs between residential houses, then you get to the beach area, where there is nothing other than lying on the sand. No activities and no food.It is clean and quiet.To eat or drink you need to go back up and look for the Cafe/restaurant area (Bungalow)Trendy.Nearby Camps bay area, is lively with a lot of cafe's and restaurants."

Amazing sunsets from there, especially if there are some boats in the bay, and you can get a silhouette!The beaches are all generally clean, popular, and protected from wind. The water is cool and refreshing! And there are sporadic vendors for cooldrinks and ice lollies that wander around calling out their wares. Quite pricey, but I suppose that's their income and beachgoers are a captive market."

Birds flying all around and a short walk to get to Camps bay and eat at the beachside restaurants. I went another time and walked from 4th to 2nd, but behind the boulders entering the 2nd beach, some girls were doing a naked photoshoot! So perhaps if you are planning on taking children, you go first over the rocks! There was also a kitty on the beach which rounded off a wonderful experience."

Perfect even on a windy day in Cape Town as it is wind-free due to its perfect location. The only thing is if you are not very fit or tired, just a word of caution, there are lots of steps to get down. Imagine the way up! There are no restaurants down there, so before you go all the way down to the beach, make sure you have all you need like water, umbrella, sun cream, sandwich as you might not want to go back down after you've made your way up the steps from the beach. If you want to avoid the steps, I suggest you go to the fourth beach as there are less steps and they are not as steep as those of the other beaches in Clifton."

One has to descend a number of steps to access the beach, but it is worth it, especially on a day when most other beaches in Cape Town are very windy. It is advisible to get there early to get parking, but in the off season, it is not usually a problem. It is possible to rent beach chairs and umbrellas. Life guards were on duty when we were there. There are 4 beaches. 1st beach is tough to get to. 2nd and 3rd beaches are great. 4th beach is the most popular for families with kids. It gets so hot, that one usually has to brave the cold ocean temperatures for a quick dip. There are change facilities and cold showers at the beach. Roving sellers will be happy to sell you cold water, pop or ice cream. You have to try the \"Granadilla Lolly\" (a tropical fruit flavoured popsicle)!

Its a long way down the 101 stairs so take just enough to carry for one trip down the 101 steps to the beach. Vendors do sell ice lollies and coldring on the beach. Street Parking is limited so be prepared to walk if you do not leave early for the beach. There is paid parking at the Clovelly Country Club which is where I always prefer to park. No alcohol is allowed on the beach. There are also no pets frequenting this beach, so no dog is going to take awizz on your picnic basket of sandcastle... It is a must summer experience for Cape town."

It is certainly picturesque, but as a beach (actually a few small ones) it is a dead loss. All about posing and tanning and looking cool, even if you are as hot as a lime burners boot on a barbie fork because the sea is too cold to swim. Say what, YOU go there!"

We love going down there to people watch and to sun tan - swimming is only for the brave as it is freezing! We visit these beaches mostly to watch the sun set - the Cape Townian favourite thing in summer is to do \"sundowners\". We pack a picnic - text the friends to join us and head down to have supper and watch the sun set. Try it - it is great fun! Our favourite is 3rd beach for the sundowners. Pack some candles as it is quite magical to do a circle of light around you once the sun sets!"

But it's worth a walk, because once you're there, it's pretty laid-back. You have a choice of four beaches, numbered 1 to 4 from the city end. The population varies from season to season, but a constant is that 4th, the largest of the beaches, attracts families and ball games, whereas 3rd, the cosiest, attracts lots of gay men in Speedos. The general ethos is pretty exhibitionistic, but there's space for everybody, and lots of little coves if you don't fancy the meat market. The water is too cold for all but the hardiest to swim in, but it certainly is refreshing. Lovely at sunset when the crowds have dispersed somewhat."

There's a pretty full car park with limited parking. From there you have to walk down steep steps, carrying your stuff. The beach is a beautiful, powdery one. But the water can be , to put it mildly, refreshing. There are bed and umbrella rentals available along with paddle boards. On the day we were there and through summer there was a promo where bodyboards and bat n ball were being let out for free. There are ice cream sellers with their uniquely Cape Town patois; Lolly make you jolly etc. Amusing though tooooo frequent.A great place to see and be seen and definitely hear. You can hear half of Johannesburg on the beach using their cell phones to contact the half left behind. And loudly."

They are all beautiful with clear water and amazing sand, but people are completely different. One is occupied by families with children at all ages, one is for elderly people, one is covered with \"the most beautiful\" people in Cape Town and one is held by the gay community. So each and everyone can easily find their perfect spot... Enjoy!!"
