The cost is 50 soles, which includes a ride to and from central Cusco, and the program is offered in English. You need to make reservations using their website, but you don't actually pay until the end of the program that evening.The planetarium show was excellent and provides a basic overview of astronomy, the night sky over Cusco, and its importance to the Incas. However, the highlight was the telescope viewing. We looked at Saturn (which was spectacular!), the moon, Mars, two star clusters, and a binary star system. Make sure to check the weather forecast before you go because overcast or rainy weather will obviously impact the telescope viewing."

You start with a very interesting explanation about how the quechua people used astronomy in their lives, you also see the constellations at the domo and what is the best part is to go out to see the sky through their telescopes. I went there twice, the first night was a little bit cloudy but we could see Saturn, some constellations and the Milky Way; the sky was much better the second evening and I had the honor of sharing some more time with Mr. Erwin Salazar while the rest of the group received the introduction, so he showed me different celestial bodies and it was great to know more about how the Planetarium started, then I laid down on the grass to watch the stars while the rest of the group were looking through the telescopes! IT WAS AMAZING, clear skies in a magic place! Just bring a very good jacket because nights in Cusco are cold."

Their culture was very advanced in terms of astronomy, and relied heavily on the stars to master agriculture as well. Tour picked us up in Cusco, and once we arrived, they gave us a bit of a lesson, let us see stars and constellations ourselves through their giant telescopes, and then showed us the classic dark room planetarium stars. Note, it was one of our first nights in Cusco and we hadn't realized how cold it can get once the sun sets. Take a jacket! You will be outside for part of it."

That enthusiasm makes the visit worth it."

You're picked up in a square near the Plaza de Armas and driven up near Sacsayhuaman. There's a little intro and then some star gazing and a planetarium show. Unfortunately it was a full moon, so we weren't able to see a lot of stars with the naked eye, but they still looked gorgeous in the telescopes! Overall a fun experience!"

The tour picks up from one of the smaller plazas in central Cusco and takes people in a bus to the planetarium, which is a small building next to a playing field away from the bright lights of Cusco. Stars and planets are viewed from telescopes on the lawn, and the planetarium is in fact a projection onto the ceiling of the building. Nevertheless it is very interesting particularly when discussing Inca understanding of the stars, and those from the northern hemisphere get an explanation of the southern night sky and a look at the milky way if the night is clear. Dress warmly and choose a night with no moon, for best viewing"

A mini bus takes you to the Planetarium. We were presented information on the significance of astrology for the Incas, which I found incredibly interesting. In a special room simulating the night sky, we then learned more about different constellations and how to recognise them. In the end, we observed the night sky through telescopes. I enjoyed the fact that the Planetarium is a family business. Everyone was also very passionate about what they were doing.Really worth a visit!"

You meet in the square and are taken to the planetarium near the Sascy ruins. Our guide was great with good English and a good knowledge of astronomy, it mainly focused on the Southern Hemisphere and he gave a good explanation of how the Inca's etc used the night sky to guide them. Following a history on the Inca's we went into the planetarium dome where we learnt more about how the Southern and Northern Hemispheres worked and about the constellations which was fab. The final part of the tour was outside looking at the stars both with the naked eye and through the telescope. This part was done by a different guide who clearly knew a lot about the stars and planets and was very passionate. He used a laser to point out the constellations then we used the telescope to view star clusters, Mars, Saturn and most impressively of all the moon. Def worth the 50 soles each to experience this!"

I'm an amateur astronomer and whenever traveling I carry my portable telescope to both observe objects I don't get to see in my location in the US as well as share with others the splendors of the sky.My wife discovered the existence of this planetarium and we booked a visit the only night we were free. We were met at a park in downtown Cusco and driven to the Planetarium's location out of town.We were absolutely amazed at this family run passion project. Upon arriving we were brought into a room and given a brief introduction on how the different Inca sites are aligned with the Winter and Summer Solstices. For such a small operation they had huge backlit photographs professionally made and hung on the wall.After this intro we went inside their planetarium, a room they had installed a spherical ceiling into, and their own homemade star and constellation projectors. For such a small operation the way they created this planetarium was absolutely ingenious. Here we were given a tour of the Southern Hemisphere stars. Following this was a very professional slide show that explained the Incan constellations. Even though I'm an avid astronomer I learned a great deal from this part of the tour.Finally, the tour ends outside looking at objects in the sky through two telescopes and a pair of binoculars they have on hand. At this point the tour was handed over to the Uncle who excitedly showed us Mars, Saturn, and the double star Albireo. Unfortunately, the night was hazy so we couldn't observe any deep sky objects.If you are visiting Cusco definitely keep an eye on the weather and book a trip to the planetarium! As I said before, it's a family run passion project that was informative even for experienced astronomers, great for kids, and filled with enthusiasm for the subject. My wife and I are already making plans to return in a year and want to visit this place again."

Pick-up from central Cusco, they take you out to their building and give a short lecture explaining importance of sky to Incas, then take you into their Planetarium dome.

You will hear a lot about Incan history- but the best part is when they take you in their planetarium and project the stars/constellations. The stories and information we heard here about the Incan relationship with the stars and sky were very unique. this isn't something you can hear about on a city tour or anything. And it was a really cool way to get ready for our trek to Machu Picchu- we were able to recognize constellations where we were hiking! Only downside was that it was a cloudy night so we weren't able to see anything out of their telescopes."

            "review": "Unique Experience! Group was way too big!. We were really looking forward to this very unique experience \u2013 and it was truly something very special! The evening was very informative and after an interesting talk, we went outside and got to look through three different very powerful telescopes, aimed at the moon, the nearest star to earth visible from the Southern hemisphere and a planet with it\u2019s moons. We were in awe at what we saw! It was absolutely freezing, despite our thermals and layers of clothing, gloves and hats! Our hosts handed out blankets to everyone, which really made a huge difference, especially while we were outside. We booked a private experience by email directly with our hosts and shortly before our departure to Peru, the date was changed due to a personal commitment on their end, which understandably happens, but we would no longer have a private experience, which was quite disappointing. Our hosts met us in Cusco at the agreed meeting point in Cusco to drive us up to their home. (No charge for the ride!) Our hosts were absolutely lovely, very personable and likeable \u2013 quite funny and quirky too. The talk we had was very interesting and we really enjoyed it. We especially enjoyed the comparison between modern astrology and the way the Inkas and ancient people of Peru viewed and utilised the stars. The only criticism I can offer is to limit the group sizes. We were about 40 people and it was a tight fit. We had to be split into two groups, which caused a bit of a disorganized situation a few times. Also, with the viewing through the telescopes we had to line up for quite some time and then got only a few seconds to have a quick look. If the group was much smaller it would have been more manageable and a more unique and personal experience - and everyone would have had enough time at the telescopes. Getting back to Cusco could not be done all in one go and we had to wait for the first round of buses to return before we finally got our turn. It was absolutely freezing and a very uncomfortable wait. Take a torch for the walk back to the minibus \u2013 it is pitch black and there are stairs involved! Lucky we had ours! I would certainly recommend this experience, but fork out the extra money and do a private tour (then hope it won\u2019t be cancelled)."

I felt safe with our guides, and they clearly have it down to a science because at least two other groups were there that same night. You start indoors, where they explain the stars and how to spot them. If you're usd to the Northern Hemisphere, it's a treat to see the Big Dipper upside down! They have blankets available towards the back, make sure to grab some! It gets cold outside. Once outside, they'll point out various stars and planets that you can see either with the naked eye or through the telescope. On my night, we saw Jupiter! Really cool, not rushed so you have time to enjoy or look again if you want. Could use some snack or hot beverage option.

But the place is still within the city, so you get all this glare from city lights ! First part was interesting - when they talked about stars and legends. But part in which we actually watch the stars is really so-so. They have one mid size telescope, so you won't see a lot of details... I must say it was way overpriced experience.It's a family business so I wish them all the best, but there is a lot of things they can improve:-move your base further away (to total darkness) and give more time for individual experience- make smaller groups - it's not good to wait for your turn for telescope in a group of 20 people- lower your price or offer better experience"

I think is not the number one of the activity you can do in Cusco.. but if you have a lot of time.. then do it. it's not expensive."

We were taken by mini-buses from the square up to the observatory on the hillside above Cusco about 10 minutes drive away.The evening was split into three: general details of the sky at night and the constellations, information about the Inca astronomy and finally practical viewings through binoculars and a telescope.The evening's group was split into three with each sub-group rotating through the activities. It was very well organised and wonderful to see the enthusiasm of the family members as they took us through their presentations.A really excellent and informative evening and highly recommended, but wrap up warm as it can get cold up on the hill at night!"

They were able to squeeze is in last minute, and everything was very well run and organized. We started in the planetarium and learned about constellations in the northern and southern skies. Everyone in this family-run business is extremely knowledgeable. We then learned about Inca constellations, ancient time telling, and how they learned to predict the weather. Finally, we went outside to stargaze. We saw a few clusters that you are not able to see with the naked eye, as well as Mars, Jupiter and 3 of its moons. Bring a warm coat for this part. They also provide blankets if you need them. It is the perfect amount of time, and they drop you back in Cusco just in time for dinner!"

This is followed by a presentation in the planetarium dome and then gazing at the moon and stars (if visible) through some high-powered telescopes and binoculars. We weren't quite as wowed as we anticipated based on the reviews, but it was still a unique experience and we're happy to support a family that is passionate about educating folks on early astronomy.

The pick up was at 5:40, and the lecture lasted about 1.5 hours. We were supposed to then go outside to spot constellations, but as we were in the rainy season (their summer month of January), and so we couldn\u2019t see anything. I did appreciate that they are a family-run business that operate out of labors of love. They genuinely care about the environment and human connection to it. I hope that they can survive. Also, an added addition: I didn\u2019t have the chance to see Sacsayhuaman. (Well, I decided to skip it, actually, because I figured it wouldn\u2019t have compared to Machu Picchu). The \u201cobservatory\u201d is located close to Sacsayhuaman, and so I got to see most of it on the drive up the hill. Student price: 30 soles.

They have their own private transport from the center of Cusco and the tour has several parts - a presentation about Inca astronomy, a planetarium projection focusing on the Southern constellations, and observations outside if weather permits. Our tour guide was quite knowledgeable and showed us a few important stars and objects in the sky. Many of the facts he told us were very interesting - for example that the Incas knew how to predict El Nino from the brightness level of the Pleiades. As constructive criticism, I would point out that when we went outside to observe it was still twilight, so do it later in the summer months. Also, the observation outside was too short - by the time it got really dark and it happened to clear up a bit, we had to go. I would have liked to have the option to stay longer in their yard in order to observe, maybe even by my own. Perhaps they can give that option and then call you a taxi? The observations outside did not focus much on the Southern Sky, which is why I went primarily - most tourists would be from the Northern hemisphere I imagine. Overall a very worthwhile and recommended experience."

We called the planetarium from our hotel, and they left a message for us telling us they were open. They picked us up in a tourist van at a nearby square, a guy in a Planetarium Cusco jacket came to find us. They take you up the mountain aboout 15 minutes to a small family place with a \"farm\" type feel. The tour takes about 2 hours, and begins with an introduction to Inca history and mythology. We then got to see a star map and interactive presentation, learning about the night skies and galaxies visible at this time of year. It really set the stage for actually looking through the telescope outside! Jose was fantastic, and the blankets we got were a nice touch! I highly recommend this as an early evening activity-- just be sure to bring warm clothes!"

The brightness of the moon is irresistance to taste like the inner layer of Maltesers. I have never viewed and to know that the moon is so so bright under the telescope.

So if they don't offer anything up, ask, as they likely have something and it is for a good cause. I booked the \"tour\" through my accommodation, and it was a little disorganized waiting for the driver...but they found us and we all got to know each other while we waited in a very cute square just off the main square. The chocolate museum was just there, so there was something to help \"pass\" the time. I really enjoyed it."

I have to admit my expectation was to see a modern day planetarium, so when we drove up to their building I was at first taken aback. However, it was explained to us since they are located in a national park there are a number of regulations that prohibited new buildings to be erected. In any event, it was a good opportunity to keep an open mind. I'm glad that I did. The tour is broken up into three parts. The first part is more lecture oriented. The second part is in the planetarium itself. The third part ties both the first two parts together and how it relates to the Inca civilization. I won't go too much into detail, but I had a great time learning about the stars and how also the Inca viewed celestial spaces. The guy who gave the tour really loved talking about astronomy which made it more enjoyable for me. If you go to do a hike afterwards through the hills, it's really cool to know this stuff before hand. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone visiting Cusco. It's fantastic and one of the highlights for me during my time there. I also saw Saturn and its rings!!!!! so amazing!!!"

A mini theater with a rounded dome displayed a projection of the night sky, where we reviewed the common constellations (some unknown to me in the southern hemisphere) and also learned the stories behind ancient Inca constellations. After the indoor presentation, they equipped us with blankets and hot tea to go outside for live sky viewing with their big telescope. Unfortunately the clouds of the rainy season were not cooperating, but amazingly the knowledgeable professor was able to reveal a bright star in Andromeda and Mars for us before we called it a night.

NOTE: You have to make a reservation, something that I missed on their website. Regardless, they were accommodating."

When the evening started I was worried that the planetarium was not going to impress me but it really did. This family-run business is small, but they have impressive telescopes and a star dome. Before the clouds rolled in we were able to see the binary stars at the bottom of the Southern Cross as well as Saturn (its rings!) and Titan. Inside we learned about how Portuguese sailors named the southern constellations. Most interesting to me was the stories about the Inca constellations- especially the black llama! I thought it was a great evening in Cusco and I would recommend going- especially if you have an interest in the stars."

My parents and I (I'm 17) visited in early June, and we had a beautifully clear night, which I understand is pretty common this time of year. The planetarium is family-run and it feels like it- we were welcomed by three family members bearing warm blankets, and Gandalf the dog. There are three parts to the experience- a lecture on the history of Incan astronomy, stargazing outside (using a telescope, we saw the Jewelry Box Cluster, a globular cluster, Venus, and Jupiter and its four Galilean moons), and a tour of the zodiac and southern constellations in the dome. The family members were welcoming, funny, and well-informed. I would definitely recommend this experience!"

It was also fun to see the Southern Cross and all the new constellations in the Southern Sky. We would DEFINITELY recommend this activity!"

I read about the Planetarium Cusco in my travel guide, and when I saw the picture of the Inca astronomy at Qorikancha, I knew we needed to go to the planetarium! You do need to make a reservation, though they were able to squeeze in one extra person. We made our reservations just a few hours in advance, and it was totally seamless. They picked us up in the square across from our hotel, with the rest of the group and drove us up to the planetarium, which is near Sacsayhuaman, overlooking the city. The building itself is small but cozy, which was wonderful on a chilly night. We started with a brief history lesson about the Inca civilization and how important astronomy was to them. The woman who was presenting was fantastic, super informative and approachable. After the history lesson, we went outside and used two telescopes to look at Jupiter, the moon, and several beautiful stars and constellations. The night sky was incredible, and the staff did a great job pointing out the main constellations and giving us plenty of time to enjoy them. They even brought us hot tea!Then, we went back inside and had the chance to experience their lovely planetarium, with Western constellations, and then the beautiful Inca constellations. All-in-all, a memorable evening with lovely hosts. I would definitely recommend this to anyone before hiking in the area. The best part was being out on the trail and looking up and identifying so many of the constellations. Absolutely breathtaking. It's easy to see why the Incas were so involved with the stars. A must-visit while you're in Cusco!"

We are Northern Hemisphere folks so I was looking forward to seeing the Southern sky. We were picked up from a central location in Cusco and driven up to the Planetarium (appropriately situated away from lots of light pollution) and met by some friendly dogs. It was, obviously, very dark and it's an uneven hill down to the building so be warned. The family who runs the planetarium are delightful folks. Uncle Erwin is the man behind the telecopes and was a sweet man. He queued up some telescopes outside on real stuff and whenever I leaned over the eyepiece he'd say something like, \"Take your time, really enjoy it.\" You can tell he's a space buff and wanted to share that love with others. His niece was the one who lead our little group through the indoor planetarium section. She was also a lovely woman. Sure, we saw some cool planets (we also had patchy clouds that night) but it was the people that really made the visit. This family is doing something they love and their enthusiasm comes across to visitors. And now I get to look for the Black Llama in the milky way!"

They tell you a bit about Incan history and why astronomy was important. They also have a domed room and project the stars on the ceiling and show you the shapes of the constellations and their meanings. Then you go outside and they have a big telescope, maybe 4 ft. long and show you maybe four stars and everyone takes a turn looking at them.

The constellations were brilliant and we looked at Jupiter's rings and moons through a telescope. Maria is really enthusiastic and entertaining, and her planetarium show indoors included the Inca constellations (llamas, naturally). Wrap up warm!"

The two hours were spent learning about the night sky and stars, the Inka's interpretation of the stars and stargazing outside with a hot cup of tea. Ana and her uncle are lovely people. We got ripped of for 40 soles at the travel agency where we booked the trip, and Ana promised if we didn't get the money back, she would personally go down there and get them back for us. Definitely do this, it is a different experience from what you usually would do on your travels."

I emailed the planetarium in the early afternoon and received a prompt response confirming availability for the evening. The presentation is given in English and Spanish. It begins with a projection of the cusco sky at night onto a domed ceiling with Ana and her uncle showing all of the visible constellations. The presentation then turns to the Incan constellations and the importance of astronomy to the Incan people. The tour concludes outside viewing constellations and planets through their telescope (blankets and mint tea supplied)."

We saw Jupiter with it's dark bands and 3 huge moons, Mars, the Souther Cross, double starts and even other galaxies. We even saw 2 shooting starts. This was a wonderful experience. We loved it!!!

We each got a little blanket with stars on it to help keep us warm, we saw Jupiter through the telescope (they made sure to rush us out when the sky was clear to ensure we saw Jupiter before the cloud cover might have prevented it). The instructors obviously knew a lot and were friendly, with one providing English translation since the majority of the group we were with spoke Spanish. They provided round-trip comfortable transportation from the Plaza de Armas. I think serving hot chocolate would be a plus for kids, as neither drank the tea. Dress warmly.

It turned out that this was not the wisest financial decision as the cost of 50 soles/ pax was a tad too expensive, given that we didn't get any actual viewing of the stars due to the rain. The 1hr+ presentation was rather interesting with a good introduction to Incan astronomical beliefs, plus Ana Maria is a very knowledgeable, friendly and engaging host. While the weather is beyond's anyone's control, we felt that the planetarium could have reduced the entrance price of 50 soles by at least 10-15 soles as a matter of goodwill when it rains. I also think if the group is big (10-20), the price should also reflect the time one gets at the telescope."

They will pick you up in the small plaza beside plaza de armas and take you to their facilities just up on the hillside.There are three aspects of this experience:1) First thing you do is learn some interesting facts about astronomy and agriculture and the Incas,2) Next is find out how to navigate through the night sky and some fun things to look out for and also how the south compares to the north sky.3) You'll get a chance to look through their telescopes at clusters, the moon (which is actually super cool!), venus, and other things that may be up there depending on the weather conditions. Although it's not a government operated planetarium (so don't expect some super advanced equipment), the organizers (who are super fun and enthusiastic as noted by other reviewers) definitely make up for it and you still get to see amazing sights!It's a very fun alternative to going to a bar; I only wish that I had been able to go when I first arrived rather than at the end of my trip.Tip:- If there is something you want to see in particular, let them know and they will try to find it for you in the telescopes.- It can get cold, so bring your warm clothes! They give you hot tea when you're outside using the telescopes.- Their communication is very good; just send them an email with any questions!- They pick you up around 5:30PM and drop you back in the plaza about 2 hours laterIts not super cheap (s/50, s/30 for students/children), but if you budget for it, it's an enjoyable excursion you should try!"

Have to say I was really impressed about the energy and enthusiasm the the lady put into that lecture (bearing in mind she probably does that every night) and learned so much not only about the Incan astronomy but also the culture, history, politics and Peru climate. All very interesting and informative. The theory was followed with some practical peeking into the telescope outside, allowing to look at different stars. Was blown away by seeing Saturn through telescope (and even got a sticker at the end to say I have seen one :)) The nights in cusco are cold so we were given blankets and cups of warm tea, which was a nice touch.

When we arrived, I was surprised as it is not exactly the type of planetarium you expect. Actually, it's just a little house up in the hills, near Saqsaywaman.We were about 15 persons, half of them spanish speaking, the other half was an english speaking group. But that was no problem at all, we had 2 guides so we split up into 2 groups. I was in the spanish speaking group. Our guide, a Prof. who is also the director of the Planetarium, explained us a lot about the Inka's and their relation to the stars, the universe etc. It's just amazing what the Inka's already knew about the whole universe. Actually one could say that their whole culture was connected to the stars, our sun, the milky way...the Professor explains this amazingly good, and you will be fascinated from the first minute he starts talking!After a lot of interesting explications, you will have the possibility to have a look trough their telescopes. We were able to observe Alpha Centaury, the second \"nearest\" sun to the earth, the lower star of the \"cruz del sur\" constellation and as a highlight planet Saturn with his moon Titan.If you don't come here, you will definitely miss a highlight of Cusco!"

It is a family run operation. They gave a nice talk about the Incan culture and then we went into an indoor planetarium and stepped outside to view the constellations and some stars. It was nice to apply that knowledge in the following weeks to continue to find stars and constellations on the dark inca trail and in the jungle"

Nightly shows include a presentation about Incan history and culture through the lens of astronomy. Then you visit the planetarium and get a review of the constellations with a focus on the southern sky. There is also a slideshow that shows theIncan constellations including the dark constellations. Finally, you go outside and look through their very good telescope.

This is a great activity for families or for adults who love to stare at the stars. My favorite part was learning about the Incan constellations. The only recommendations I would have would be to purchase stronger telescopes (I'm no expert but I have seen the rings of Saturn from sea level with a telescope in the everglades, in my mind that makes me think that at an altitude of over 11,000 feet I should see a clearer picture of Jupiter rather than what looked like zooming in on a star) whenever possible and to arrange for a darker setting in which to enjoy their knowledge and the beauty of the skies. I understand their limitations and with those mind I believe they do the best they can with what they have and that this is a great experience for a clear night in Cusco."

The bus picks you up early evening from one of the squares and takes you to the planetarium on the hill side overlooking the city. First an introductory talk (English and Spanish options done separately) which was wide ranging about the history of the stars and its uses - for example in agriculture. Then we went outside where it had got very dark very quickly and had a wonderful session star gazing. The hosts used laser pointer pens to pick out constellations and planets. This was excellent as no matter how hard I have tried in the past I have never picked out anything more than Orion's Belt! Next the big telescopes came out and the very knowledgable and passionate professor picked out some of the best sights in the night sky - including Jupiter and the Orion nebular - where stars are born.Finally a presentation inside the planetarium dome showing the constellations with helpful pictures overdrawn and an explanation of the inca astronomy of dark constellations which was fascinating. It was very cold but we were provided with plenty of blankets and we were impressed with how the trees had been planted around the site to minimise the light pollution from the city - very effective. An excellent evening costing 50 soles each which I highly recommend to anyone before embarking on the inca trail to learn a few basics to appreciate the night sky along the trail."

They made a wonderful presentation and handed out blankets/hot tea as it is quite chilly at night.

My wife and I were delighted by the presentations especially the opportunity to view several southern hemisphere deep sky objects through the telescopes at the Planetarium site.Of especial note is the care the presenters gave to describing Inka constellations, which are mostly \"dark or black\" constellations produced by dust clouds obscuring stars in the Milky Way. I would have preferred to hear more about those (the resident astronomer, Prof Salazar is an expert on Inka constellations and star knowledge). Northern hemisphere astronomy buffs should not miss the opportunity to see the glories of the southern skies....and so close to town (but with minimal light pollution)! Some of the astronomy knowledge presented (intihuatanas, the Oyanti pyramid, the Q'enqo \"awakening the puma\") will be invaluable in enhancing visits to nearby Inka sites including Tipon and Machu Picchu.Prof John Stocke, CU Boulder astronomer"

It was especially interesting to learn how the Incans were the only civilization to also have \"dark constellations.\"We were a small group of 4, which nicely felt like a private showing. Unfortunately, the moon was almost full the night we went so it was pretty hard to see many stars. If you're flexible, I recommend visiting when the moon is least bright. We also didn't spend as much time outside looking at stars or planets through the telescope as I would have liked. Perhaps if we had an even later start time, we might have possibly been able to see more. Alas though, so much of visibility is contingent on the weather and the moon.The student discount costs 30 soles which made the experience affordable.

Always a fun experience, I love planetariums for the projection presentation, I was at first disappointed as we were presented with the more well-known western astronomy bits and constellations, but quickly perked up as discussion on the Incan astronomy and astrological myths began (my favorite part!) Sadly, the clouds weren't cooperating and we missed out on telescope use that night, but I imagine that would have been lovely as well.The family's passion for the stars and their heritage definitely comes through with a high level of warmth, consideration, and intelligence. However, a few suggestions:1) It's cold in there, is there not anything at all they can do to warm the place up? (Bring your mittens and hats and scarves!)2) For those needing English translation the dome projection experience was at times difficult to follow (at times the Spanish and English overlapping one another), I am hoping over time they can smooth out the kinks in the presentation 3) Just a bit of hands-on or interactive experience would be lovely - especially if the telescope experience is not happening due to weather!Overall, lovely experience - highly recommend it! :)"

The tour is in 3 phases, 1) short lecture where you learn about the history and importance of the stars to the Incan people, 2) going outside and looking through telescopes at the stars, and 3) coming back inside for a brief presentation in their observation dome. The evenings are cold in Cusco, and they gave was hot tea and warm blankets for when we were outside looking through telescopes.

It was my first realization that I was outside of the northern hemisphere for the first time, as I saw constellations like the Southern Cross. I even got to see Saturn and it's rings. Definitely recommended as a fun evening activity before a late dinner."

They go to great lengths to make you comfortable in the cold (blankets and tea included), and are very enthusiastic. The indoor presentation didn't have too much information, but really I think that's because most of the information about the Inca is unknown. Much of what they share is stuff you will hear elsewhere while traveling through this area. The best part was looking through the telescopes at the star clusters and Saturn (which was cool, but as you would expect, brief.) If you don't have much time in Cusco I would probably skip it."

A van picks up the group (ours was about a dozen or so) on Plaza Regocijo, located just a block or so from the main square. It is a ten minute drive to the planetarium proper.The evening presentation is divided into three main sections over two hours. First, a twenty minute introductory lecture is given reviewing the role of astronomy in Inca culture and its role in helping make decisions regarding religious offerings and crop cycles. Various storyboards are used during this time in addition to a 3-D model of the solar system. Next, the group is taken into the planetarium (indoor \u201cartificial sky\u201d) where a professor of astronomy displays various constellations from both the northern and southern hemispheres and continues basic concepts begun during the first lecture. Lastly, weather permitting (we had crystal-clear skies), the entire group goes outside to see various planets, stars, and constellations on professional telescopes. These machines aren\u2019t the usual rickety contraptions on tripods but the real deal; I saw the rings around Saturn and Mars for the first time in my life! Attention to customer service is superb throughout the entire process: blankets, tea, and goodwill are in abundance throughout your stay until your return to Cusco about two hours after arriving.Later in our trip, we could put a lot of the information to good use when hiking the Inca Trail the following week when the Milky Way and Southern Cross suddenly became identifiable (and therefore meaningful) instead of functioning as passive sky ornaments. Other topics such as the role of the summer and winter solstice kept popping up while we were at Machu Picchu. As perhaps the biggest compliment to the family who organizes this, I just recently purchased my own (very amateur) telescope and will be watching the moon through its phases next month.An overall excellent experience: inexpensive, well organized, useful, and entertaining."

We were told we were going to be picked up in Plaza de Armes on the stairs of the Cathedral. We happened to notice that they were having a parade in Plaza de Armes and all of the streets were shut down. I asked my hotel to call them to confirm our pick up point. They tried all of the numbers but the people in charge were not around and kept telling our hotel to call back. About 30 min prior to leaving our hotel finally speaks with someone who agrees with the traffic and has us meet them somewhere else. They showed up 15 minutes late but there was a lot of traffic. We were dropped off at a small home about 15 minutes from our pick up point. It was very cold and they had a lot of people there that night. They handed out blankets but did not have enough for everyone. The lady who spoke had very good english and you could hear her passion behind her stories. They bring you into a dark circular room after the introductions and explanations where they show you constellations on the ceiling. This was actually really nice. Everyone in our group though wished they could have shown each constellation by itself so our imaginations could visualize it better. After the dark room, we all went outside to look into the big high powered telescopes. Clouds were starting to roll in, so we could only see a few constellations. The southern cross was very beautiful. We were also shown Saturn and you could actually see its rings!!! That was awesome. During our trek, we would look up and find ourselves finding all of the stars and constellations that they taught us. We had to leave a little early since we all had to be up at 4am the following morning. The lady said that the van was dropping us off at the hotel, but we were dropped off in Plaza de Armes and had to walk 15 minutes back to our hotel."

An other number was picked up by a tour agency, who said they couldn't do anything for us. Another one wasn't answered.What is it about Peru that you get unclear directions about where to be, you wait for an hour, and in the end nobody show's up? A big disappointment, we were really looking forward to this. And unbelievable how businesses are just fine with disregarding tourists like this, that are willing to pay 50 soles per person.

My 2 best friends and I found this on trip advisor and decided it was a must do prior to our PeruTreks Inca Trail 4 day hike as we all loved planetariums and star gazing. We were travelling the month prior to arriving in Cusco, but Ana Maria was very efficient and we were able to organise a tour via email. We waited at Plaza de Armas, and the driver appeared at the appointed time. We were driven up the mountain to the Planetarium. What initially looked like a little farm and shed out the back, quickly gave way to a a quaint observatory, informative charts and awesome telescopes. The presentation on Inka astronomy, the links to agriculture, practical usages and integration with culture were fascinating. It helped us understand what we saw along our trek to Machu Picchu. Bring warm clothes as it gets cold at night (gloves, hat, scarves, warm jacket: layers are best), camera, you may find a small torch or headlamp helpful for seeing where you are walking. They do have a torch but it is hard to see after dark. Don't let the simple appearance fool you, the information is well researched. Our Spanish is terrible, but Ana's English is excellent and understanding the wealth of knowledge she presented was not a problem. Look closely at the 'pierced drum' which is used to shine the constellation onto the inside of the dome. The family were so thoughtful, they brought us hot tea and blankets to keep us warm whilst we were star gazing through the telescopes outdoors. Would highly recommend this to all ages, and that visitors organise to do this soon on arrival to Cusco. The 2 to 2 and half hour experience was over all too quickly"

You will have at around one and a half hour class of the Inca astronomy (and comparisons with the mainstream astronomy) with people who really love what they are saying to you. Also, depending on the weather conditions you will see the stars through good telescopes. I have not seen this attraction in any traditional guide, just through trip advisor. I recommend the planetarium to anyone visiting Cusco who likes planetariums. Anyway, it is interesting to go only if you have more time in your visit to Cusco. "

They also were able to schedule an affordable private show for two people (as we were there during a time with few tourists); they are also bilingual, for non-Spanish speakers like myself.

Erwin Salazar after seeing his Youtube video about the Pisac site (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRkoKM-iABI). He met my mother and I at the planetarium's departure point where some other people were waiting. We were whisked off to the planetarium's site near Sacsaywayman. Ana Maria gave a very nice presentation in English and then translated for Prof. Salazar while he treated us to a very nice planetarium presentation about the Inca constellations and star names. After the presentation we headed outside for a look at the skies and a had peek through their telescope. We saw many things that we Northern Hemisphere dwellers never see, including the Southern Cross and the Centaur. He trained the scope on the Jewel Box, Alpha Centauri, M7, Saturn and a comet to top it all off! A very memorable night. I only wish we had more time to visit with Prof. Salazar..."

On the night we went, it was just my husband and me, one other couple from the U.S., the guide and a professor. It felt like we were on a private tour with two very enthusiastic hosts. They will pick you up in Cusco and drive you up to the planetarium, nestled in the hills. Depending on the light and the clouds, your tour may vary, but for us we started outside, looking through two telescopes at different celestial objects the professor found: the rings of Saturn, distant moons, clusters of stars... then we went inside to get a tour of the planetarium from the English-speaking host, and a short star show. It was fascinating to learn about the ancient and modern local interpretations of the stars - such as that the Incans saw constellations in the black spaces of the milky way galaxies - and to learn more about the southern sky. It's not the biggest facility in the world, but the enthusiasm of the hosts and the charm with which they share their love of the stars is contagious. It was a special night!"

            "review": "Fascinating Experience. My girlfriend and I were really glad we did this. We did it at the end of our stay in Cusco, and we both think it would have been better to do this first - it explains the alignments of several historic buildings with the solstices, the significance of the layout of Cusco itself, and is the most historically accurate view into Cusco's past I encountered while there (some tour guides you'll come across there will be weaving their own stories). Since I had heard it all by the end of our trip and I like to challenge guides out of curiosity and to gauge credibility, I have to admit I was really impressed with the professor's knowledge. It would have been a great foundation for the rest of our visits in the Cusco area.We wished we had called earlier (we called the penultimate night) so that we could have been there on a clearer night and with a group (instead of individually since it's a lot less money), so don't make the same mistake we did there. Honestly, if it hasn't become clear already, this place was an afterthought for us, but we wish we had made it one of our targets from day one!"

Not only do you star gaze (we saw saturn and its rings) but you get a lesson comparing inca astrology to what know/believe today. Who would have thought cusco was built to align with the sun and that the incas could reliably predict el ni\u00f1o from the stars. fascinating and well worth the money.

We were blessed with clear skies and so after a tour of the Planetarium inside, where clever displays show the ancient methods of stargazing, we were taken outside and treated to a quick tour of the star systems available to us that night. Then we looked through the telescope at parts of the Solar System, before returning inside for the actual Planetarium show. The Plantarium is a family run enterprise and as well as imparting to us their expert knowledge it is obvious that the people involved are there because they want to be. Their passion for the heavens is infectious. Highly recommended."

THe staff were friendly, knowledgeable. Because you are over 10,000 feet high there is so little atomsphere that the images of the plantes, Ring nebula, star clusters and other sky objects was amazing. We were part of a group but flt as if we had an individual tour. The Professor of Astronomy is a charming gentleman who answered all questions in a kind, intelligent manner. Not to be missed. If I return to Cusco I will be back with this wonderful group. Finally this is one of the few times when the price was really too low for all of the value Paul Hart"

They include transportation to the site and begin around 6:30 pm. The facility is located on the hillside over looking the city or Cusco, Peru. It is small and informal but the exhibits and presentations are professionally done. Information is in English and Spanish and is suitable for Adults and for children. The typical presentation covers general astronomy, the Southern night sky, and the Astronomy of the Incas. It involves a brief lecture, two presentations in an intimate but high-quality planetarium, and then live outdoor star-gazing. The staff is very knowlegeable and informative. They can answer any questions you may have and tailor the experience to your interests. Dress warmly and expect to have a good time."

We found out about this place from a lonely planet recommendation and were fortunate that the owners could arrange a spur-of-the-moment group visit the night before we left on the Inca Trail. Though it doesn't explicitly say on the website, you can book visits most any day, so just send them an email. We had no disappointments, it was reasonably priced and lots of fun.This is a locally-inspired venture by a friendly guide and an astronomy professor who is absolutely enamored with the sky, and makes you feel that way too as you learn the constellations of the southern skies through a telescope on the outskirts of cusco. Genuine oohs and aahs galore!If you're in town for more than 2 days, I would not miss this one."

Having never been to the southern hemisphere, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at some of the southern hemisphere's sky objects. Fortunately, I found out about the Cusco Planetarium just before we left. I contacted them and they agreed to meet us at our hotel in Cusco and take us to the planetarium. This was the night before we were heading out to Machu Picchu.The planetarum is located at the edge of town within a small ecological reserve. They picked us up at 5:30, and we arrived 10 minutes later. We went in and Ana Maria provided a 15 minute lecture (in English!) of the southern sky and its relation to Inca culture. This was very good and I recommend it to anyone prior to going to Machu Picchu. You will understand the astronomical objects and features of the site better.We then went into the planetarium. Ana Maria was joined by her father (the astronomer brains) and they pointed out the Southern Cross and other constellations, as well as Alpha Centauri (the closest star to earth after the sun), and other objects. They discussed their meaning to local cultures. We spent about a half hour there.Then we went outside just as the space station flew by, which was cool. They provided hot drinks and kept a wood stove burning to keep us warm (it gets surprisingly cold in Cusco at night because of its elevation) as we looked at several constellations and other objects with the naked eye to get oriented. Then they pulled out an 8\" reflecting telescope and we looked at several features - the Jewel Box cluster (the prettiest object I've ever viewed through a telescope), Saturn with two of its moons, a variety of other open and closed clusters, and a binary star. They then drove us back to our hotel by 7:30.I highly recommend the planetarium. It is not the typical \"touristy\" fare. You will see a real slice of Cusco, get a concise lecture on the southern sky and what it meant to earlier cultures, and see beautiful objects that you can never see in the northern hemisphere. The price is very reasonable, too. My only regret is that I did not try and talk them into pulling out the 14\" Celestron reflecting telescope I spied by one of the exhibits to take a look at some deep space objects, but maybe next time.This tour is appropriate for kids of all ages and will please non-astronomers as well as astronomers unfamiliar with the southern hemisphere sky. My boys (12 and 10), and my wife both enjoyed it as much as I did."
