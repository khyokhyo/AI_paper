This free walk tour around Budapest takes only 3-3.5 hours, but it still manages to cover all the major tourist attractions. I have visited both General and Connubist historical tours and I am looking forward to take part in Jewish District tour too. What I like most is a friendly approach of guides, their language skills and preparation. The tour creates an international atmosphere and the guide always tries to devote some attention to every participant. If you are interested in cultural / historical / architectural aspects of Budapest, you should not miss the opportunity to take part! Moreover, it is totally free (based on tips only), which will fit any budged."

She was friendly, knowledgeable, informative and enthusiastic with nice information regarding the sites as well as the country and city as a whole. A wonderful overview to this beautiful city and I would recommend this tour to everyone. I hope they would do a longer walking tour or another tour to cover Gellert Hill as well, so that we would be able to see the Citadella. But overall, fantastic experience. Thank you!"

We were lucky enough to be shown around by Brigi, who was full of facts and fascinating information about so many aspects of the history of Budapest, the people, architecture, food, social change as well as helping us understand some of the more traumatic events to affect Hungary. This tour was a brilliant addition to our holiday and we cannot recommend Brigi highly enough, we have done several of these types of tours in other countries and found Brigi to be absolutely excellent and extremely approachable and very friendly.

The Hungarian guide, Ursula, knew very well the topics. Her English was very good. She was able to explain centuries of Hungarian History in a nutshell. Very good introduction to this fantastic city. I only wish I had taken the tour earlier in my stay, as it is a very good introduction to the main attractions of the city. At the end of the tour, the guide, Ursula, was available for personal guidance such as where to go to eat, dance, rent a bike....It is really free. A contribution of 10\u20ac is suggested, but you can give any amount you want (really). I recommend these tours for first time visitors."

He is equally knowledgeable and interesting The subject matter is difficult but he was respectful in the description of the atrocities and included interesting facts about the neighborhood also.Be certain to be generous in your gratuity so these tourscontinue for others to enjoy."

History comes alive when it's shared by someone with lived experience of the period. She crammed interesting history and detail into each stop of the tour which means you really get your money's worth, but the pace was sometimes a little hard to follow, even as a native speaker. Might not be the best tour for speakers of English as a second language, but it certainly delivers passion!"

It was around 2 1/2 - 3 hours long and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think that they should do a pit stop in the middle to allow for bathroom break and we had a hard time initially finding the tour guide because all he had was a paper that said Free Budapest Tours (meet by the statue in front of Starbucks in Deak Ferenc ter). Other than that.....it was a GREAT tour! I would HIGHLY suggest that you tip your guide......sadly I saw too many people on our tour walk away without tipping or tipping VERY little."

She kept us entertained the whole time, fully in character, and interacting with us as we climbed stairs for an hour and a half - which went by so fast !

You don't see anything in depth but gives good information for you to return and investigate on your own later. Our group began as a very large one - maybe 30 people - but they had two guides there to separate the groups should that happen which was very nice. We tried to hook up with the afternoon Jewish Tour and no guide showed up! Very disappointing as there are many free tours to be had so unlucky for us."

Bad things to have in mind though, the tour gets a bit boring cause the guide tries to give to much information and is not very well paced in her speaking, that makes it a bit too long.

She rounded up the Castle tour with a beautiful folk song and recommendations for all generations - she even met us later in the evening in one of the bars for a fantastic folk dance party with live music, apparently a UNESCO cultural heritage!

The guide, Orsi, who I had been guided by before, showed a fantastic depth of knowledge about this dark but fascinating time of Hungary's history and it was obvious the amount of research of history and politics she had done and obvious too that she had spoken to many people who had experienced these times by the wealth of personal feeling and thought provoking detail she was able to convey. From the depths of the hard times of iron rule from Moscow to the thawing and eventual demise of Communism this tour is a real eye opener to anyone but especially those of us that remember those times from our side of the Iron Curtain. The lines from the poem 'One Sentence on Tyranny' by Gyula Illyes, a Hungarian poet and novelist, that Orsi quoted, are worth reflecting on and re-reading afterwards to recall Orsi's passion for this tour. Join it, learn, appreciate and tip well!"

As we are not natives to the city, we figured it would be so much fun to learn some fun facts and stories that only a tour guide could tell.Upon arrival, when the tour guide (Andi) realized that we are in fact Hungarians, the first response was that this tour might not be for us. A bit surprising, but we explained that we would like to see what the Budapest tour is like, after having done a lot of the other cities by free walking.After a while Andi approached us and asked us if we were tax inspectors, because if we are, then she would send all the folks away immediately.Shocked, we clearly stated that we were no tax inspectors, we just want to see the city, as we have been living here only for a couple of years. She nonetheless insisted that we are tax inspectors, and she does not have her receipt book with her at the moment, so we might as well just admit that we work for the tax authorities.After some further explaining ourselves that we are really not working for the authorities and have no intention to impose fines, just to have a good time, she was still unconvinced.We just decided to leave, and have a walk in the city by ourselves.Never ever have I felt more humiliated in my own country."

Our guide (Norbert I believe) was very informative, passionate about his city and taught us a lot about Hungary's history, some of which a lot of us were not aware of. I came away having enjoyed a lovely walk around a beautiful city as well as having expanded my knowledge about Budapest.

Orsi was our guide, such a friendly person, answered all questions to the very deep levels, such knowledgable, dynamic and smiling person who made us feel very warmed and comfortable even when it was almost zero degrees in town. She always made sure everyone is following, listening, hearing, understanding, and surely laughing with her jokes. It was best decision in Budapest to take this tour. Too bad the video I recorded has problems with the sound but I really wanted to share how she ended the tour: she sang and danced exhibiting traditional Hungarian art (or Magyar as she explained the common worldwide mistake). The tour is highly recommended. Oris, thank you, you made our visit just perfect!"

We were hosted by Andi who was an excellent guide for our 3 hour tour. She was full of useful facts and information and provided good advice for making the best of our remaining time in Budapest. This is a great way to start a visit. It is a 'free' tour but you are expected to provide a donation to cover the cost of the tour. This is fair enough and is a great way to take in the city with a real expert who is enthusiastic about her subject."

We just turned up for this free walking tour on our first morning in Budapest as we thought it would be a great introduction to the city. Firstly the guide was easy to spot with her red umbrella. Ursula (?) was really friendly and knowledgeable and as we were a small group of only 4 tourists plus the guide, it was easy to engage with her and ask questions. She gave us a brief history of the city and country which helped us understand so much more about Budapest and its varied story. We started on the pest side and finished up on the Buda side of the river. We were taken to interesting buildings and shown some wonderful viewpoints of the city and river. Ursula gave us very good ideas for other things to see and do in the city. I think our favourite bit was the Fishermans Bastion and the Matthias Church but it was all very enjoyable."

It was money well spent and I am trying to find an excuse to go back to Budapest to do it again. Orsi is the best guide you can ask for. Her English in not only impeccable, she is humorous and friendly. I can't recommend her enough.

The first time we tried to do the afternoon tour, the person who was supposed to be the English guide did not show up, but the Spanish guide was there. When I explained that I speak Spanish too, she refused to do the tour because there were only two clients. She then asked us if we had made reservations, which is not possible on the website. The next day, there was one Spanish-speaking client at 10:30, but she sent him away and then immediately left herself. By 10:35, six more Spanish-speaking clients had showed up, but had to be turned away since the Spanish guide was already gone."

Brigi took the Free Budapest Tour \"From Pest to Buda Tour\" where we walked across the Chain Bridge and up to the Castle and Presidential Palace. Her knowledge of her country's history and development was excellent, and her manner of presentation was faultless. The views from Fishermen's Wall are amazing. I can heartily recommend this as an orientation to a beautiful city. A generous tip for Brigi is a small price to pay for the value. Next day I joined Daniel for the Free Communist Tour \"Faith-Terror-Communism\" and he proved also to be a fabulous guide, so full of knowledge and stories of this era ... recent history of which I realised I knew few details. We stayed on the Pest side, walking from the Basilica to the Parliament. He interspersed his knowledgeable talk with family stories, making this history very real, and very recent. We finished with a walk to Danube's riverside and the poignant Shoe Memorial, a tribute to the Jews who were shot at that place in 1944/45 by the Arrow Cross Militiamen. Sobering. Again, I can heartily recommend this company, and feel that a generous tip to guides such as Daniel and Brigi are monies well spent. Very well-paced, very professional. Thankyou, Brigi and Daniel."

Brigi was charming, informative and enthusiastic, and her 10-minute history of Hungary quite amazing! It did overrun a little - there's not really a proper break - so I think it would be good for them to consider that as Sandeman's free tours do, as it was well over 3 hours. That's a minor quibble though - very informative and entertaining tour."

This tour is fantastic in that way as they explain how it works in the beginning and only once more where they leave a box or bug for you to subtly leave a donation. There is no pressure or even \"suggestion\" of what to give, just what you can afford. It is a must do in my opinion even in the nearly 40\u00b0C weather!"

I really enjoyed it and appreciate that she could answer my questions. She didn't push for tips but was worth everything she got from us, which I hope was enough as it was a small group today. I'd signed up previously for a free tour with another company (thought it was this one) that met in a different location (Oktagon station). This was on a holiday Monday, and although I got a confirmation of the reservation, a reminder of the reservation, and a \"how did we do\" email after the reservation, in fact this tour didn't happen. A guy showed up and told us it was cancelled (after we'd wasted our time getting to the spot early). So then I signed up for this one and was very satisfied. It's important to know exactly which walking tour you're using, and I was confused at first. But this one, that meets at Deak Ferencia, is the one I recommend."

Thanks to that tour, we were allowed to see the change of guards of the white house of BUdapest at 12.00. Very impressive. The Tour is free, meaning there are no fixed fees, but you are invited to give a tip according to the tour you just did.

It gave us an overview of the city, some anecdotes and lots of information about the buildings and history of the city. Julia is a resident of the city and very knowledgeable and good-humoured and she waited around at the end of the tour to offer advice on places to eat, and which baths to visit.The publicity leaflet implies that the tour is aimed at (young) backpackers. Perhaps this is because there is a steep flight of steps leading up to the castle in Buda. I think the tour would be suitable for anyone as long as they were aware of the steps. Don't be put off if you are not a young backpacker.We also did the Faith, Communism and Terror tour led by Andrea who again was knowledgeable and used some of her own family's history to help us understand the 20th century history and politics of the city. We did this tour on our last afternoon so were unable to make the most of Andrea's experience - also it was a bit disconcerting for her as we'd already been to some of the places she suggested. I would recommend both tours - do them as early as possible in your visit."

Rita, our tour guide was very nice and did her best to give us the tour in Spanish. You can tell how passionate she is about her city and how much she enjoys sharing it with visitors. Overall, we liked it very much. My only recommendation would be that the tour is a bit more structured and informative. After finishing it, I did not feel we left with a lot of factual or historical information, which we would have appreciate it...maybe this is something Rita can improve for next time."

Being a ghost tour enthusiast, I had the ghost tour booked as soon as we knew we would be in Budapest. On the night of the tour, we met Adam, who helped me schedule it. He warned us to be careful of witches when all of a sudden, one appeared! Adam left us to the mercy of \"Mildred\". She lead us through the haunted streets of the city, enchanting us with ghostly tales and dark history lessons. \"Mildred\" was a fantastic and enthusiastic story-teller. At the end of the tour, she encouraged us to take the Free Budapest Tour.Intrigued and looking forward to learning more about breathtaking Budapest, I joined Orsolya the next morning for another tour. Not only is she an experienced tour guide but she is a history teacher as well. I could not have asked for a more thorough introduction to the rich and varied history of the country. Orsolya was clear, concise, patient with all of our picture taking, and encouraged questions and dialogue. To conclude the tour, she sang us a lovely folk song so that we could hear how beautiful the Hungarian language can sound. Along the way, she did give us a few language lessons. I found the simple words and phrases helpful. Afterward, she offered suggestions for further sightseeing and even marked our maps.It was 2.5 hours perfectly spent."

By 1 pm we had all enjoyed an information packed tour. No fuss, no pressure to buy into anything else, no taking you passed shops where they have a vested interest ... Open to any questions and eager to enlighten us about Hungary's history, Adreea had an unassuming delivery which belied her knowledge of this interesting city and country. Whilst the tour takes two and a half hours it is not a route march and there are frequent points of interest stops and photo opportunities. Thus us a relaxed stroll through stunning architecture and fascinating history.Probably the hardest decision comes at the end of the tour when you decide on the size of the tip! Judge us or judge us not we gave 2000 HUF and were amongst the first to pay. It seemed about the right amount and if the other 15 or so couples did the same .... well you do the mathematics.Would we recommend this tour? Yes we would. There are some slopes involved to get to the top but all who signed up had no trouble, including young children. Well done Andreea!"

Adam was enthusiastic about the tour, very proud of his home city and a great guide. It was really informative about the sights and the history both recent and centuries ago. We covered a lot of ground on both sides of the river with the walk across the chain bridge and the views from Buda the highlight. The tour provided our bearings for the rest of the city break and Budapest is beautiful city. Adam has every right to be proud of his city. Would definitely recommend it"

Adam was well researched, spoke very good English and, as a Budapest man born and bred, was able to add a lot of fascinating personal information. I would add that according to Adam's interpretation the tours are not 'free' as such - the amount you give is 'free', i.e. up to your discretion, but naturally some reward is expected in return for almost 2 hours of his time, which seems only fair. It is still less than the tours that have a fixed price tag attached, and we didn't think we missed out on any information. We would definitely do such a tour again. Thanks, Adam!"

We especially enjoyed that we could hear the history of the city from a true local's honest perspective. In Budapest again this time with family, we took the 10:30 am tour with Dora, and enjoyed some history with a tour of both sides of the city. Her songs through the tour were wonderful, you could tell that she was enthusiastic about sharing Hungarian culture with the group. The next day, we caught the 2:30 tour on Faith, Terror, and Communism (my second time) and I was happy to see Kate again as our guide! We had another great experience with her.

The previous tour ended up in the Castle area of Buda, whereas this concentrates on the Pest side looking into the politcal and historical aspects of the area.Our guide was called Dora who we had met on our first tour, she speaks great English, is very knowledgeable of the City .It is great to have someone point out the different sights and areas and their significance both politically and historically. The tour lasts approximately 1.5 hours and is an easy walk, my wife who walks with a stick found it quite manageable. It is also a good way to meet and chat with other tourists and exchange information and suggestions. At the end if you have enjoyed the tour you can give an appropriate tip.

Unfortunately there was a bit of overlap on both tours so it probably makes sense to do one with a different company/guide just for a different perspective, but I completely understand why there was overlap, as most would attend just one. Overall, it was a great start to my time in Budapest."

I was only in Budapest for a few days and presumed that a walking tour around the city would be my best way to get my bearings while learning some of the rich history of the nation. This tour did not disappoint. Our guide (Andrea) was just wonderful! She knew a plethora of information about the stops we made on both the Buda and Pest sides of the city and knew exactly where to take us to get simply STUNNING views off the river. We learned about everything from statues and monuments to the cathedrals and castle, as well as some Hungarian words! Andrea even sang us a bit of an old Hungarian folk song. We also got to see the changing of the guard at their \"white house\" which was quite unique. Overall, this little tour company does a fantastic job of orienting you to the city and making you feel welcome in Hungary."

She was charming in every way and her English was impecable. The group was small and we felt like having a personal guide and could ask questions freely. The following day we have opted for a Free Tour with an alternative company. After just 10 minutes we have relaized that this was a mistake and have left. Luckily we were still in time to join the Free Tour with Orsi around the Buda part. Orsi was a great guide. Her love and knowledge of the city, country and culture, her energy and humour made our day.Thank you, Girls, for making us love Budapest even more.Advice to the reader: make sure you choose the right Free Tours (from Deak Square 10:30 and 14:30)"

I would highly recommend everyone to undertake one of these orientation tours at the very start of their visit to Budapest. Orsi gave us an excellent tour, she is so knowledgeable and has so much information to give about the city. Her tour was well spaced out with plenty of time for stragglers to catch up before she started her explanations and descriptions for that particular point of interest. During the tour she gave us a summary of the last 1,000 years of Hungarian history and was very patient in answering all of our questions. From Pest we crossed the Duna and climbed up to the Fishermens Bastion to admire the stunning view over the Duna to the Hungarian Parliament and beyond. At one point Orsi paused and sang to us in Hungarian, what a pleasant surprise. Finally the brochure we had collected from her at the start of our tour contained recommendations of places to visit and, in addition, she marked on the city map other locations people had had recommended to them prior to their visit to Budapest. Everyone in our party of 13 agreed that Orsi had given us an excellent tour and scored 100%. In my opinion this is the way to start a visit to Budapest. Well done Orsi!!"

She answered all our question and also asked as question so it was kind of interactive. The tour we took was the Comonism one which was very interesting. At the end of the tour we got a map of Budapest with recomended places to go - so we got some very useful tips and advices for our rest of our trop :-)P.S not only Orsi was a great tour guide but also a great photographer - she took pictures of us and was super cool."

            "review": "Great tour, but not for everyone. I've done several food/beer tours in different parts of Europe, but this was the first walking tour I planned on doing. My travelling companion and I did not know exactly what to expect, but we figured we would try it out. The meeting location is very accessible, and we met up for the 2:30 tour of the Pest side (the morning tour is of Buda). Sadly, I do not remember our guide's name but she was very friendly and knowledgeable! However, we quickly learned that this was the type of tour where you stop every 10 minutes and then listen to a history lesson for another 10-15 minutes. As we were on a time crunch, we decided that this was not for us and tipped her for the few minutes we had spent and then went our own way. Here are reasons you should go with this company: Guides are friendly and highly knowledgeable (felt like I was in history class). If you are staying in Budapest for a while and want to know a lot about the history, this is a great program. Here are reasons you should not go with this company: If you are only spending a short amount of time in Budapest (side note: 2 days is not enough time), you do not get to see a lot of different stuff on one tour. One of the reasons I like doing tours is to get to meet a lot of different people. I don't know if it just happened to be the group that showed up that day, or the time of year (just post-Spring break time), but it just didn't have that lively/chummy feel that some other tours have. Bottom line, it may be the perfect tour for you if you want a slower-paced, very informative one. If you are on a time crunch, not so much."

            "review": "Excellent way to get started. We went on the free morning tour, starting from Deak Ferenc Ter at 10.30am. Being Easter Sunday, it was a fairly big group with people from all over the place.The lovely Katalin (or Kate to us English folk) was an engaging guide with plenty of stories to tell. Being Hungarian, from Budapest itself, she certainly didn't lack local knowledge. Over the 3-hour tour, she gave us a potted history of Hungary, from its founding through to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Communist era and the modern day.The tour started with some orientation about the city, basic Hungarian, and what to avoid as tourists. Katalin then took us through central Pest to the Chain Bridge, and then over it to Buda. After the walk up to the castle complex, we were given a good introduction to its open-access areas, with the tour ending at the Fisherman's Bastion -- a good point from which to look over Pest and plan our day. It was about 2pm by that point, so we'd definitely got our money's worth!At the end of the tour, Katalin was happy to stick around and give people recommendations for the rest of their trip.It was a really good tour, and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone spending their first day in Budapest. I think the same tour runs at 2.30pm as well.One thing that was quite different from a \"free\" tour we took in Prague, a few days earlier, was the lack of asking for tips -- at the end, a purse was handed round almost apologetically. Perhaps its not the done thing for a Magyar, but I think Katalin missed a trick by not pointing out, early, the importance of tipping. I hope she got a reasonable amount of cash from everyone, anyway."

At first, it was only my husband and me, but she was happily willing to go with just us. Before we left, 5-6 more joined us, so we had a great small group to get a good grasp of the city. Orsi was a wonderful guide, full of information, great tips, best places to see, etc. She had great insights from a local's perspective for eating, activities, museums, transit, and even recommended a local Hungarian folk dance she herself attends on Friday nights.

During both tours, we got to see the main attractions of Budapest and learn about the history of the city. It was also a great way to learn more about the Hungarian culture. You do quite a bit of walking so make sure you wear comfortable shoes! Walking through the city was so much fun because you get to see the architecture of the buildings as well as observe the residents of the Budapest. The city has so much character that is highlighted and explained during the walking tours. Feel free to ask any and all questions because the tour guides know a lot about the city and will be honest if they don't know an answer. Therefore, they will not misinform you about Budapest/Hungary. Furthermore, our guides gave us recommendations for restaurants, wine bars, ruin bars, and other tourist attractions that were not covered in the tours, which we went to and had great experiences at. Lastly, the tours are free but it is customary to give a tip. It doesn't matter how much you give since the tour guide does not look at or count how much you give. Therefore, you are encouraged to give depending on how much you enjoyed the tour and how much you can afford within your budget. I highly recommend the walking tours not only in Budapest but in any city that offers them. My friends and I had a very positive and joyful experience."

We saw a lot from the city and views of Budapest.Personally I would have liked to learn more interesting facts of the history of Budapest and how the city's infrastructure came about.. But we did see some nice buildings and architecture and did a great Hungarian dance (optional) near the Mathias church..Make sure you tip the guides because it is a nice way to see Budapest."

The route was planned thoughtfully with some time out of the cold (!) and we got a great coverage of the major sights. We went back to a number of them...especially the strudel shop! Thanks Kate, you set a high benchmark for future tour guides!"

Kate made an effort to chat with whoever was nearest her on the walks between stops, and did a great job of trying to include everyone. The tour was also very informative and made me want to learn even more about the history of Budapest and Hungary. We did the Pest tour a few days later and Kate remembered us from the other tour. For the Pest tour we had a different guide. She was lovely and knew a lot of information, but she was a bit shy, and seemed reluctant to talk about some of the darker aspects of the tour (not people questioning her, but she would start to talk and then trail off)."

Essential in the sense that it's not only necessary, but it took the essence of Budapest and presented it to us to take home as a highly-cherished souvenir. The trip was amazing. I learned more than I did in history classes. And what's more important- I found out how similar Hungarian's history is to my own country's. Our guide Dora was amazing: constantly smiling, answering questions and as curious about us as we were about Budapest. And the best part: she sang a lovely Hungarian song on top of Buda. Spring winds sound lovely in December. I strongly recommend the tour! Budapest is such an amazing city. Go explore!"

My friend and I were the only two people to show up, so we got a personalized tour that felt more like a conversation with an interesting new acquaintance than a tour! Our guide, Vicki Horvath, was excellent. She spent part of her childhood in the U.S., so had perfect English, and told us many stories about her own family and friends living in Hungary under communism as well as their experiences coming back for visits from the U.S. and her experience eventually moving back as an adult. She also presented an excellent picture of Budapest today and the challenges Hungarians face as the country recovers from communism. The walk is actually very short, with more standing than walking. Both the site and the guides recommend tipping \"whatever you feel\". We were not expecting to be alone, so we felt a little uncomfortable when it came time to hand over the tip. We wanted to give more than we would have if we had been in a large group, especially since Vicki spent more than two hours with us, but we couldn't really talk about it standing right in front of her. I believe that these guides' income comes only from tips. I would recommend deciding ahead of time how much you'd like to tip and planning for a few different scenarios. I will definitely try the other tour next time I'm in Budapest."

The best way to see Budapest is on foot, many interesting and true grisly stories were told, the theatrics were delivered brilliantly and in perfect English and the suspense was nerve-wracking. We were constantly on edge for the hour and a half of the tour. We learned a lot about Budapest and Hungary, but the most interesting stories were those that you wouldn't normally be told on a sightseeing tour. Oddly, lights would either switch on or off as we walked past, a car alarm went off, all adding to the eeriness.Orsi is wickedly funny and a very engaging speaker. I laughed, screamed and got to walk through Pest on a beautiful misty evening.Thanks Orsi! I'll be back with more victims!"

Although we saw a lot of the city and the guide was informative I don't think when something is advertised as free and the at the end a suggest amount is given. That's what happened here. It was also noted a few times by the guide how hard things are for the people of Budapest and people like herself have to work three jobs in order to survive. Facts these May well be but when followed by a suggested tip at the end, I feel somewhat let down. This is just my interpretation. Overall the area covered was good, in terms of geography and history."

I don't usually write reveiws (this is my first) but I was so incensed by BethyT12 comments that I just had to write this one. The Ghost I went on was superb! well choreographed, a nice balance between TENish minute stories and walking. The Actress was faultless and stayed in character throughout the tour quite a few people were scared and there was a sprinkling of jet black humour. A surprising ending made this one of the best Ghost Tours I've been on and I've been on 9 so far. So if you like this sort of thing and even if you don't. make sure you do this tour and make your own mind up. As Mr Burns would say Exxcellent!"

We were not disappointed! The tour guide/actor/ghost himself was top notch. He stayed in character 100% of the tour, never breaking once or cracking a smile (except his eerily creepy smile with accompanying devilish laughter!). He did an excellent job telling us an entertaining mix of ghost stories, urban legends, and historical facts that make up the creepier side of Budapest's history - both past and present. He made a few of us jump, particularly the girls! :) It was funny to see the looks on people's faces as he passed them on the streets. I know that if I encountered him walking down the street at night, I would be terrified! Overall a great time, a fun and entertaining tour. Absolutely worth doing while in Budapest for a fun and different type of evening activity!!"

After reading a couple reviews about this famous ghost, me and my girlfriend decided to give it a try and we were not dissapointed!!The actor is really immersed in his role and knows perfectly how to balance the creepy with the humourous. It is even cool to see the reaction of people passing by when they see a creepy ghost followed by a bunch of people around the streets of Budapest.The tales the ghost has to tell blend in very well with the surroundings and history of the city and are very entertaining.The tour itself lasts about 1.5 hours and is a good mix of walking in narrow streets and stopping by a few known and not so well known buildings.So, if you want a night that is a bit different and a little more macabre; we can fully recommend this tour!K.D (The Belgians)"

I am so glad we chose this tour! Oshi, our guide, was absolutely amazing. Her English is perfect, and her knowledge of the history of Hungary is fantastic. This 2 hour tour is the perfect amount of history and sightseeing. Oshi even sang a Hungarian folk song for us! We had a small intimate group which was perfect- you could ask anything and Oshi knew the answer.I have already recommended the tour to several friends who were heading back into Budapest this week. I highly recommend this tour! Budapest is easy to walk (assuming you can walk the steps up to the castle) and it's wonderful to see from a locals perspective! She also gives lots of information on where to eat at inexpensive, excellent restaurants. We had to rush to get our ride to Szeged so could not take advantage of her depth of knowledge of the city.The tour is free but you can tip your guide. They will let you know what would cover their costs (which is less than $10), but they do not require a tip. Given that tours can cost over $50, it was easy to be generous, but that's your choice.Thanks so much Oshi for taking such good care of us and providing an incredible tour!Visited July 2013"

I must say this was the GREATEST ghost tour I have ever been on and it surpassed my wildest nightmares. My friends and I arrived to the starting point of the tour and we could not believe what the guide looked like--a ghoul straight from the grave. The minute he spoke we almost fell over in terror, but we quickly learned that he was intelligent, morbidly hilarious, and well-spoken (he has perfect English so maybe he is from America or from another world)? He led us down dark streets of Budapest where we\u2019d normally never traverse as ordinary tourists, and he told us about the brutal horrors that happened in seemingly ordinary buildings. When he told us the story of \u201cthe children\u201d we were so terrified--it was one of the most disturbing stories I have ever heard. By the end of the tour, we all were relieved that we were still alive. Honestly, this is a must-do when in Budapest. By the end of the tour my friends and I were considering skipping our plans to go to the thermal baths and return again on the following night's tour. The guide is that good. He put so much effort into the tour which is rare these days and it was refreshing to see someone who really knows how to tell a story. So thank you to our guide! I definitely would recommend this tour for people of all ages (there were even children on our tour)--it was a real treat!"

For 2 adults and a 14 year old it cost about $50.00. Once the walk began, I soon got over the price tag. Despite the 89 degree temperatures at 8:30 at night, the tour guide was in full costume. A black polar fleece tunic that also covered his head finished off with white stage makeup in his face. His English was excellent and his story telling skills were quite theatrical. My 14 yr. old was very creeped out by the whole thing. We walked through the city listening to his tales for 1.5 hours and then he posed for pictures. It was great."

The Buda-tour was with Victoria/Viki and she is by far the best guide we ever had during our free walking tour adventures in other cities. She cared a lot about the city and its history and she wasn't afraid to share many stories of it with us. She also almost constantly referred to interesting places we should also visit during our stay (ruin bar e.g.). The tour was quite the hike uphill but definily worth the while. The Pest-tour was way too short and actually quite dissapointing. The guide was 10min late and the walking tour itself was merely a 1km walk. The stories were not at all \"communist history, terror and fear\", as the flyer said, but a patchwork of different small anekdotes of which we could conclude that Hungary wasn't the most ideal place one can imagine. A bit sad if that should be our feeling after the tour, no?"

However we found the explanation of history strongly biased. The Hungarians were basically described as permanent victims of the events of the 20th century, there was no other view or reflection. Having done a similar tour in Berlin I believe it's possible to explain a complicated history in a simple way,yet remain somehow objective. I also felt quite uncomfortable about the way we were asked for tips at the end. I understand how these tours work and just don't need an explanation of what their costs are and how much I should give. It's just weird and counter-productive."

Important sights were explained, a lot of questions answered (but don't believe all of Adam's stories) and the history explained in the important context. I liked most about the tours that after this day, we knew where to go first to explore the city a bit more - sights (from the insight), pubs and bars, restaurants and nice places to visit. Of course, the tours are not 'free' - tip well if you liked it and less if you didn't.And don't miss the Literature walk! If you like books, stories and poems - you will not regret it."

He gave us a great understanding of the city, its history and its arts. Adam has a tremendous knowledge of his city and can easily adapt his tours to include your particular interests. As well as speaking several languages Adam also carries out voluntary work in one of the art museums. It seems whatever your specialty is Adam know a lot about it and is very personable in the way he explains things. As well as acquainting us with the underground system, he also recommended good restaurants right across the price range from a Jewish self-service eatery, a strudel restaurant, through to a top end cake and coffee house.By the end of the tours it felt like you had been taken around Budapest by a friend and I have attached some photos of Adam at work.Adam if you ever come to England we would be more than happy to show you round Cambridge but don\u2019t expect our knowledge to be a patch on yours \u2026 we had better start reading our history books now.Liz & Graham x"

In relation to the previous negative review with this particular tour guide, I completely disagree.

It didn't happened at all because the nice tour guide (I think her name is Ursula) refused to do it because it was raining and there were just two people for the tour - Us!According to the reviews and the Free Budapest Tours website there are free tours everyday. The message that is passed to customers is what? That there's tours everyday no matter what. You don't need to book and it doesn't mention a minimum of people to do it. At least I didn't read it anywhere and still don't find anything about it. Maybe I'm wrong but don't think so... There's lack of information about their modus operandus! That's just a shame...We arrived a few minutes early and waited, we met both tour guides but the one that was doing the tour was the one that stayed - Ursula.She was very nice at first and asked us to wait a few more minutes so more people could join us but as nobody showed up. As nobody showed up she first started to ask if we would like to see something in particular and we answered that we were expecting to get to know the city better in order to explore it afterwards. After this she started asking us several questions including one about where did we fly from... She already new we were Portuguese but in our opinion (mine and my husband's opinion) she was trying to know if we were emigrants to try to figure out how much she would get from us as tip at the end.Guess what? We lied... We told her we flew from Portugal and that was our mistake (or not!). The truth is that we don't like personal questions and being judged by our nationality (if that's what happened... I can't tell for sure, this is just my opinion and the impression that the tour guide gave us). After we provided her this information she asked us if we wanted the tour and we said yes but then she just said it would be a better idea to do it on another day with more people...She gave us a map and provided us some useful information of what to visit and where to go (at least she did that after refusing to do the tour! That was, actually, the only decent thing she did after refusing to do the tour!)We thanked her but obviously we didn't gave her any tip after the bad impression she gave us.Again, I'm telling you what happened because I feel it's my call to warn everybody visiting Budapest and looking for a free tour... If the weather is not nice and there's not enough people you might not get a tour with this company.About my opinion and impressions... They are what they are... impressions according to the person's (guide) behavior. I do understand that this company lives from tips and we were willing to give a generous one at the end as we always do when taking free tours. In this case we were willing to pay more because the guide's work would be more personal. That's just common sense. We made no offer at front because the way things were done didn't pleased us at all and if the guide was not willing to do it at first we wouldn't have a good time either.I did several city tours and from my experience paid ones like I did, for example in Berlin, are much better but to get to know the city a free tour can be good too. In Prague we had a good experience with a free tour and gave a generous tip. The Prague's Sandemans tour with Jacob was captivating.Unfortunately I can't tell the same of this one. The only thing I can say and advise to the company is that they should revise the way they work and provide this information on the website and also they should improve the way they communicate with people. Asking questions that suggest that the guide is looking for information about customers social and economical status might be uncomfortable and give a bad impression. Anyway, we were able to explore the city and enjoyed it as much as we could. This small episode didn't ruin our Budapest experience. We never let those things affect our vacation. We actually loved the city and had met some wonderful, polite and professional people along the way during our stay."

My guide, Orsi, issued the green and red city map which was so much easier to follow than all the other city maps esp if you want to go further afield. We went on the 10.30am Pest to Buda tour in late September Orsi was just getting over a cold but she still had a lot of enthusiasm for the tour, and between sips of water gave us such interesting facts about Budapest and its history. My husband really enjoyed the political history and how much it had affected Orsi's parents' and grand-parents' generations. This kind of information we would have not got if we had just followed a guide book. The fact that Orsi's English was excellent made the tour the more enjoyable and she allowed us to ask her a lot of questions during the walk. We have been on other tours in other countries which we just switched off because we could not follow their English. Really recommend this tour, and if all the guides are like Orsi they do deserve their tips. Plus we were in a group of 6 and 2 were returnees from a different tour by the same guide."

Warning : tour is due to last longer than indicated, due to dedicated guide.Do this tour at the beginning of your stay.Highly recommended, wear good walking shoes !"

Both tour leaders have taught and lived in the UK/USA and speak very well in English. As well as showing you the sights of Budapest (many of which are wonderous) they give you a pretty full historical account of the past 1000 years(!) and are not shy with their opinions which makes it more interesting. If you arrive on the tour with zero knowledge of Hungarian history you may get a bit overwhelmed with all the information (although the groups sizes were quite small - 6 and 10 in the groups I was in - so it's easy to ask questions), but if like me you've at least read the history section of your Budapest Lonely Planet and know a bit about European history (ie. know your Ottomans from your Hasburgs), you will find the tour pitched perfectly. Lots of practical information about the language and where to eat, bathe etc. too."

            "review": "Excellent 'free budapest tour'. We went on the \"orientation tour\" and the \"complete pest.\" Would absolutely recommend these to everyone, especially the former. The orientation tour is especially good to do as soon you arrive to get a sense of the city, see quite a few of the basics in one go and it might give you ideas as to how to prioritise where you want to go during your stay. The guides are extremely useful, answer any questions, and the ones we had were from budapest and so gave personal insights. I learned loads and loved it.Although the tours are called 'free' they run on tips, so you should offer something to keep these ace guides going :)One thing worth noting is that the tours are relatively long, and ours ran over the expected time. Which is fine because i found it so interesting. But I have lower back problems and my back was aching by the end! Although they do the question/answer/talky bits in seated areas, and the guides are accommodating so might be worth mentioning any problems like that to them at the start, and you can always leave early. But still Im not sure that older adults or my parents would be up for it, id be tempted to say these tours are geared for 'younger' travellers in that sense. Would suggest you are fed before the tour as although we had seated breaks, we didnt stop anywhere to eat, and you might get tired after walking on an empty stomach."

We used the mal on their leaflet during our whole stay to get around and find places to eat or to go out! It was a lot of fun and you could really tell that Vici likes her job.

Important sights were explained, a lot of questions answered (but don't believe all of Adam's stories) and the history explained in the important context. I liked most about the tours that after this day, we knew where to go first to explore the city a bit more - sights (from the insight), pubs and bars, restaurants and nice places to visit. Of course, the tours are not 'free' - tip well if you liked it and less if you didn't. And don't miss the Literature walk! If you like books, stories and poems - you will not regret it."

Most of the time he sounded lik he had learned the context by heart and instead of being natural or improvising he has been giving the very same speech to every of his group. We did tip him as he made an effort. It was more like a presentation and not as conversation up to the end of the tour."

The route was well thought out and took us to all the main sights in Pest and we were given lots of historical background information and fun facts by our lovely host Brigi. The tour lasted about 3 hrs with plenty of breaks and stops for photos however I recommend to wear comfortable shoes and bring water. Also we went on the afternoon tour so it was quite hot so wear sunprotection/ sun hats etc. The tour ended in the Jewish District and we were each given an information pack with personal recommendations for attractions/restaurants etc. We also had a little quiz at the end where we had the opportunity to win Budapest postcards if we answered questions correctly - a lovely touch. I'd highly recommend this tour especially early on in your visit as it gives a great overview of the city."

My niece (age 17) and I took Orsi's tour our first afternoon in Budapest and it was a wonderful introduction to the city especially helping us get the layout of the city in perspective. Buda and Pest are large areas to cover but the 2-hour tour was sprinkled with breaks for shade while Orsi told us some of the secrets of the city and her presentation included history, romance and makes you glad you came to Budapest. The walking tour includes a lot of hills but it was a nice pace and the group included age ranges from kids around 7 years old to people in their 60's. Orsi had enough tales to keep everyone entertained and at the end of the tour she was kind enough to share her favorite spot to have a pastry and visit. Would highly recommend this tour -- it's not only free (but they do work for tips!!) but informative and great way to meet other travelers and have a local enthusiastic guide by your side as you enjoy spectacular views of a beautiful city."

The free tour with Adam was a great was to get a feel for the city from a local perspective as he shared his experience of life in Budapest. Adam was friendly and knowledgable with a real sense of pride and enjoyment in being able to show his city. Despite the cold weather it was a lovely way to spend the morning and discover a little more about the life and culture here. It was also nice not to have pressure of buying additional tours/packages that sometimes comes with tour companies. I would recommend it for sure!"

The guide, Orsi, was toally captivating with her excellent knowledge and very cheerful and friendly approach. Her personal and family history really brought home the contrasts between the communist era and now and made me realise how lucky I was to be able to visit this wonderful city and to have lived in 'free europe'. To do both the morning and afternoon tours is a MUST as there is so much to see and learn, would like to give this tour more than 10/10 as it really is that good. Go to Budapest and enjoy, you will not regret taking these tours. Already thinking of going back to do it all again in warmer weather!"

Very easy to find the group at their starting point just outside the Deak Ference ter station for the morning tour. The tour covered Pest; the group does an afternoon tour that covers Buda, but I did not have enough time to do both. The Pest tour covers St. Stephen's Basicalla, Freedom Square, and ends at Parliament. This morning tour does not cover the Castle district. Our tourguide, Brigi, was excellent - very knoweldgeable about the city, and very engaging. The tour moves at a nice pace, and Brigi was very flexible in letting the group take pictures and spend ample time at the main sights. The tour makes money based on tips at the end of the tour, and this is handled very well - no pressure. Brigi was able to provide additional tips on other sights to see, including good restaurants and good places to buy souvenirs at reasonable prices."

Also, don't forget your camera!! It was easy to find the meeting point thanks to the descriptions on the flyer and Adam standing there with a 'Free Tours' sign. We started the tours on time and saw sights in Pest and Buda - if you take the time to attend both tours I would say you are able to see all the main sights in just one day. Due Adam's encyclopedic knowledge and his enthusiasm and love for the city you will also get a broad, extensive impression on Budapest history, culture and people!During each of the walks, we had at least one short break next to a bakery/restaurant, etc. which gave us the opportunity to buy a snack and/or go to the restroom.At the end of the tour you are requested to leave only a tip, adequate to the value you think the tour is worth - this especially benefits listeners with a low budget, like students, backpackers, etc.If you have any questions for Adam during the tour or afterwards, don't hesitate! He answered all requests we had to our complete satisfaction, and went out of his way to walk us to a good restaurant after the tour.Thank you, Adam, for all your efforts and your enthusiasm!!"

The Buda walk starts right outside the restaurant so it was very convenient. The walks are a great way to learn the city. While much of the information can be obtained from guide books, you get much more insight from these wonderful young people. Our groups were small, so it was nice to walk with the guides and ask questions along the way. At the end of the tours they ask for a donation of 2500F/person to cover printing costs and wages for the guides.

The first tour was small, and Adam answered every question I had with enthusiasm and enough details. I think you could go on the same tour dozens of times and learn new things each time with Adam. The second tour with Orsi was well-paced, highly informative, and very interesting. Also, she packs the tour with useful information, and can answer pretty much any question you can have.From what Adam told me, this is a small project with a few guides (all certified and from Budapest). I've never been on a tour with professional guides who were so enthusiastic. On my first tour two of the girls, for example, heard a song playing in the streets that they were interested in. Adam recognized it, told the story behind it, translated some of the texts, and even offered to send it by e-mail to them. I think it'd be hard to find as informed guides anywhere else in the city. I think it's the perfect way to start off a trip to Budapest if you know nothing, or even to go if you know the city well, as I did. I can't recommend the tour enough."

If you have never make such an experience you should do it.It is the best way to be introduced to the wonderful Budapest and decide what to better visit during the following days.What a pity: there is no free tour organised for the Hero's square and the wonderful City ParkBe aware: do not confuse these tours with the OTHERS... they need to be avoided... especially the Jewish Quarter tour (better to visit the Synagogue by your own)"

My friend and myself took this tour on the last day of our stay in Budapest and wished we'd done it on the first! Ursula and Adam (the tour guides) were incredibly friendly and engaged with all the people on the walking tour, making sure that each individual understood what was being said (there were French and Italian citizens in our group as well as English, American and I think Canadian). Questions from the party were encouraged and all the questions asked were answered in detail. At the end of the tour Ursula and Adam spent a lot of time helping people with other unrelated questions about where to eat/where to see folk music/museums that would be of interest etc etc etc. There was also a young child in the group who was made incredibly welcome by Ursula and who obviously enjoyed it because he was extremely well behaved! Thank you for a fantastic insight into the history of Budapest and its very interestind and diverse past."

They give you so much information about the city - it is like having a free personal tour guide, with an almost unlimited knowledge of the city, history, culture and politics of Hungary. I learned so much while i was there. They even gave us recommendations about where to eat (including veggie restaurants) great bars and clubs, and local wines and specialities. I have been on many of the different free walking tours around cities in europe, but these stood out to me as the best ones!"

I had gone through the guide book and was sufficiently self confidant while taking this tour, but Adam, our explorer for this tour, did what no guidebook can. He showed around Budapest through a native's perspective, which made all the difference. 'To me, the sentence \" Communism was widespread during xyz time\" meant as much more when followed by examples about how our protagonist then had to wait in long queues for a pair of jeans, and how much joy anything remotely American used to provide to the populace then. Another point, no guide book would have told me Adam is actually pronounced Ad:aaam ( the \"D\" pronounced as th in The).Same for the monuments, local cuisine, folklore and general way of life. The walks in themselves were informative and relaxed, and thanks to Adam I could have lunch at a rather affordable authentic Hungarian place instead of the ever so conspicuous Mc Donalds that lures one with a familiar looking menu and works on the insecurities of the innocent unrisking traveller.Over all the walks are fantastic, and the explorer a pleasant gentleman with a happy disposition. PS: It can be difficult to find the start point if you don't have a flyer, because the advert on the local map doesn't provide the start point. Alternatively, note the point of origin down before hand."

I thought he was a history professor it was so good. He gave a very informatinve history of the birth of Hungary, and explain it in a way that I remember today. I understand why things are the way they are today in Budaest. His \"side stories\" were humourous yet pertinent to the culture of Hungary. I see why Hungarians are proud of their heritage even though they have not won a war in 550 years. Adam (english name) fully explored the theme he entitled the talk, his interpetation was exciting and relevant to today's life in Hungary and now can fully appreciate the life in Hungary. I went on two other tours, and his was the best by a long shot. I am sorry I could not go to the Buda talk and would highly recommend his tour. Tips are not necessary but well worth giving him and his company something for his efforts. He even invited us to lunch at a local diner to experience the common man's meal. A very personalble tour guide and it was so good, the 2 houres ran into 3 and no one left. Thanks Adam."

We were not bombarded with hundreds of names and dates, which you never remember, but given the basics as to what happend in Hungary the past 1000 years, what problems the nations is encountering at the moment. This is all that was needed. On the way to the Chain Bridge a couple of stops were made again giving short snippets about the architecture and history.Crossed over to Buda and climbed up Castle hill where the best views of Pest and the Danube can be enjoyed. Walked around the area with brief informative stops and finally ended the tour at St Matthews church. You have to make your own way back to Pest. There is a bus , number 16 which takes you back .Found tour enjoyable and worthwhile. Tipping not compulsory although this is what the guides rely on. Any amount is welcome. With the hop on -hop off bus and the river cruises this is the best way to see the city."

Best of all, Adam showed us unique places which you couldn't have found out travelling on your own (eg. an inexpensive cafe serving local Hungarian cakes with a perfectly preserved baroque ceiling and hidden within a modern book store!).Tours of places outside Budapest is also available upon prior arrangement (though most probably for a fee)."

I have read all about the empty supermarket shelves, terror Communist rule and did not hesitate to ask them about it which they answered with honesty and sincerity what it was like growing up under Communism. Must be painful to recall the past but I was just so curious about it.That's what we like so much about them and the tours. Sincerity and honesty with the way they conducted the tours. Always with a smile (and its genuine, not fake) to all the questions from the other travellers even after the tours have ended.Thanks to them, it made our stay in Budapest so memorable.

In early September 2010, on my last day in Budapest, I took a personal walking tour of central Budapest with Adam, focusing on WW II and Cold War era history, but in fact going back to the establishment of Hungary. It was excellent. Adam is extremely well informed and conversant with this history. I have a greatly expanded appreciation for the Hungarian people and their country after the few hours I spent with Adam. Even months later I still recall this tour with great fondness and would highly recommend Adam as a tour guide to anyone with an interest in the rich history of Hungary and Budapest."

You can tell she loves guiding tourists and was thoroughly knowledgable about the city. In addition, it was FREEZING cold that day, and she balanced out our morning as best she could so that we could also spend some time indoors to warm up. Orsi even took us to a great local restaurant and ate with us afterward.I also took the afternoon Castle Tour with another Orsi, and she too was a pleasure. She even had tea with us afterward.In conclusion, the guides are very knowledgable and personable. Please remember that this is a FREE tour, and I highly suggest you tip them well. These guides do not recieve a salary."

We were lucky that we found out about the walking tour, and my wife and I learned a lot about the two cities that we'd never have gleaned any other way. Despite the cold, it was an afternoon extremely well spent and we got some excellent photographs in the snow, whenever we plucked up the courage to take our hands out of our pockets. Adam chatted to us about his experiences since before the Communist era which we found most enlightening.As it happened, we returned to Budapest with some Australian relatives in September 2010 and the first thing we tried to set up was a walking tour with Adam or his colleagues. Unfortunately, my relatives were taken ill on a previous leg of their tour and we had to cancel. We're looking forward to another opportunity some time in the future."

Very friendly, they have good suggestions and great advice for what to do or where to eat. The tours themselves are good and informative, walking through the important sights of Budapest. I did two of their tours - the first covering the Pest side of the river, and the second covering the Buda side. I was there for the peak of the cold season, so the walking part was great (and the standing parts cold), but the tour guides were happy to accommodate my frozen toes so we stopped inside buildings to talk history or drink coffee. The walks themselves were a good length, keeping the distance reasonable while covering the must-see spots.Really good, I'd highly recommend them. Do it!"

His observations and descriptions about old Buda and the castle were most enlightening. With out Zoltan we would have missed so much. Our tour ended quite late, but Zoltan was so inspiring the time passed very quickly. We paid 3000 HUF for the tour but it was worth it. We would recommend any tour with Zoltan and we intend to return to Budapest and we will make sure that Zoltan is our tour guide."

Adam was our guide, and he did such a spectacular job. He's such a personal guy, and shared so much of the deep history of the city. To his point, one day is not enough, and multiple days of walking/touring would be recommended. One thing i enjoyed most about our tour was the many personal memories Adam added to his explanations of the many prominent places we visited throughout the day...as well as the secret lunch spot which no doubt was a place for the locals. We will for sure use Free Budapest Tours again if we ever go back."

I went on a few guided tours to help me get to see various cities, and some were great (and some not at all). This was definitely the best tour I was lucky enough to go on for my trip. The guide, Orsi, was really friendly and really knowledgeable. What I liked was to be in various spots and have her know both ancient history of the spot as well as more current events that have occurred. You got a feel for a lot of the changes that have occurred and how they have personally effected people. I was one of those annoying people on a tour that couldn't stop asking questions because I found myself wanting to know more at every stage, and she didn't miss a beat, she knew it inside out. I was really impressed with where she took us and what she knew. I got some great photos from where she took us as well. I'm not usually someone that recommends these things, but if you get a chance for this tour, give it a go, and if you get Orsi as a guide, then even better."

Our tour guide showed us the most interesting things to see in Budapest and gave us good background information. she also took us to places with great views for us to take pictures. At a point we actually set down and she made a quite good Budapest and Hungary history summary (but not like a boring history class but more like history from an insider's point of view, giving examples about her family and her own experience). She was also very easygoing, smart and you can tell she had a vocation for teaching and for communicating. Over all, it was a GREAT experience"

This past summer my husband and I went on three amazing tours; one with Adam, one with Zotan and one with Eva. These were the best tours we have ever been on. We pre-arranged these private tours and paid for them, but it was well worth it. Adam is extremely knowledgeable about Budapest\u2019s ancient history, which is something I was especially interested in. My favorite stories were about the witches hill and the nations that fell when they built structures on that hill. Zotan was incredibly knowledgeable about the roman history of the area and showed us some of the most incredible artifacts, including ancient instruments that were specifically used for cosmetics!!! I learned so much on that tour. My favorite part was the authentic wine cellar he brought us to. Zotan's friend makes the most amazing wine. It is truly the best wine I have ever tried in my life. It is so much better than any wine coming from France or California. We sampled several different kinds of wine at that cellar, along with homemade Hungarian sausage, peppers and cheese. This was the highlight of our entire trip. My husband liked the wine so much that he ended up drinking it strait from the barrel. I do not recommend this. Once we got to our hotel he had to actually crawl down the hall to our room because he was so intoxicated. I do however, recommend buying some bottles to take back home if Zotan can convince his wonderful friend to sell you some. We bought six. Last, but not least, Eva gave us a wonderful tour of Castle Hill. She knows so much about the history and the stories behind each area of the city. My favorite story was that of the Hungarian Prince who was imprisoned. He sent a raven to his mother with one of his rings in order to let her know that he was still alive. You can see this Raven with the ring in his mouth on the top of a church on Castle Hill. The whole trip was magical. I highly recommend this tour company. Do yourself a favor and book a private tour. You will not be disappointed. Just email Adam at info@freebudapesttours.hu He is very quick to respond to email and we had no trouble contacting him the day before and the day of our tours. (:"

His English is not perfect and sometimes he repeats things too often but I have to say that I enjoyed the tour, it was fun and it cost me just few euros. Yes, you can leave tip at the end, so generaly all people leave tips, but in case you don't like it or you have no more money, you don't have to.

The tour starts from Vorosmarty square and continued to the Buda Royal Palace. The guides give you interesting snippets from history and the culture of Hungary, which is so important for any traveler to be familiar with.. Not just the tour, but they will even give you ideas on how you should spend your remaining time in Budapest and the good places to dine.. A must do and make sure u do it on the first day... what more... its based on tips so as a backpacker I really got a lot out of it! ;-)"

The initial conditions of a successful tour could not be worse: a snowfall, and strong wind, the temperature below 0 \u00baC\u2026 On the Chain Bridge half the group wanted go home, but just a couple of hours later we felt warmed up enough to cause the Fishermen's Bastion to melt down. How come? Well, partly the hardships of walking up the hill, of course, but if it wasn\u2019t for our guide, we would never have done it. He made this Himalaya-adventure to an under open sky-party, mixed with an academic lecture, and a stand-up comedian act. Our well-being was his main concern. He also liked to surprise us frequently and in a pleasant way: like when he took us to a little artisan shop, full with beautiful stained glass, where I had a pleasant chat with the owner's friend, who spoke perfect Swedish, or when he courted a Russian girl in her own language, or when in the middle of the blizzard a waiter suddenly appeared with a small palinka glasses on a wooden tray\u2026 An attraction for every one and in every type of weather!"

Felt very safe after the introduction to handling the Segways and following that when we zoomed around the city. Our group was small and very manageable, 4 in all. Specifically, we did the two hour tour from 3pm, which gave us a good amount of time to see the key sites and great photo opportunities at sunset. Dress very warmly, they provide a small amount of coverage for the hands but I would suggest bringing gloves and something to cover your ears. Worth every penny, can't recommend enough!"

They were very helpful and said our guide would either wait for us to get to the castle district or come back to the city and give us a tour from there (we were the only 2 on the tour!). We decided to stay in the city and our guide, Daniel, came down to meet us. He was very patient with us as neither of us had been on a Segway before, and we still got the hour we paid for on the Segway, despite all the confusion at the start and taking a while to get confident enough to go anywhere! Daniel was really knowledgeable about the areas we visited and the history of Budapest - we both left having really enjoyed the tour and looking forward to the next one!!"

Buda was \"budafull\" but once we'd been to the Palace and Liberty monument there wasn't much else we were interested in. The bus also took us on a whirlwind trip through the Pest side and that was clearly more interesting for us. We've done many Segway tours before and always find they give us a different perspective than the bus tours because of the access to pedestrian ways and narrow streets that buses can't go down. The people at Zebra were friendly and efficient and our guide Peter was excellent and handled surprises we encountered very well. When we got to Hero's Square the area was closed off in preparation for some ceremony so he gave us a quick overview from the distance and took us somewhere else. We also ran into closures at the Parliament buildings because there was a visiting dignitary from India arriving and nobody was allowed close. Peter wasn't rattled by these unexpected interruptions to the route and we carried on to other destinations and he balanced the time well so that we weren't bored by hanging around killing time at these other spots. If you have limited time in a city and can't decide on a hop-on-hop off trip or a Segway tour, I'd recommend doing both. If you can only choose one, I'd do the Segway as it really does get you to the highlights and is way more fun than sitting on a bus listening to a recorded tour."

Having previously toured Budapest by bus, we asked Tomas to do a different tour, to which he readily agreed. Tomas changed the route to take us on St.Margarets Island, as well as some key areas and landmarks in Budapest. Made a game out of increasing our Segway experience, by driving in and around the timed water fountains near the Sinagogue.Great equipment, great tour guide. Will definately repeat if we ever come back to Budapest."

I was very nervous at first as I have never been on a segway and felt anxious about falling off. We were in a small group of four and Balint our guide was brilliant! He gave us all the right amount of training on how to use the segway, how to deal with kerbs etc before we left ensuring that we all felt comfortable. The actual tour was fab zooming around the city on segways, seeing monuments and beautiful buildings and learning the history of it all. Had a fab time - TIP - Ask for Balint as a guide! Very knowledgable, and a lot of fun!"

She explained a lot of interesting details about each major site and also gave her personal opinion about its relation to Hungarian history and politics, which provided fascinating insight.

During my stay at Budapest i took an evening segway tour offered by Yellow Zebra company.Although I was the only participant, the tour still took it's place, so it was like a private tour for a normal price.After a short section of learning how to ride a segway, my guide, Dora, proceeded to show me all the main sightseeings of Budapest.She was well educated in regard to the city's history and could answer all my questions.I was told about St. Stephen's Basilica, the Hungarian Parliament Building and the process of it's creation, the history of Margaret Island, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, religion and origin of Hungarians and many other things.I really enjoyed the tour and Dora's company."

This is my third city tour by Segway and I will always look for similar now anywhere we travel ....Bernadette was great and with a sense of humour in the pouring rain. We were offered to finish the next day when the weather was better or carry on ...we had fun but were soaked, so going back to finish without squelching"

Because we did a private, and already knew how to use the segway, we were able to cover a lot of ground in just 2 hours. Budapest has designated bike lanes throughout much of the city which make travels by segway easier and safer. Toured all over town -- Heroe's Square, Parliament, St. Stephen's Basilica... Along the way, Georgia gave us tips for what else to see and do during the rest of our stay. Definitely recommend!"

We covered a lot of the city by using the bikes, and it showed us a lot of places that we wanted to visit. Although we did not ride at the same pace at times, Christy would regularly wait for everybody to catch up. We learnt a lot of interesting facts about Hungary, and history about the city. Would definitely recommend as a way to view more of the city, as walking the same distance would take a lot longer than two and a half hours. The office was also easy to find, and happily looked after my bag as I couldn't cycle with it."

The pace is very doable, no matter the riding history of the participants. The tour stays away from hills and stops often for picture taking and a bit of history. It also stops near the end for a drink and some outstanding strudel. We were lucky to have 2 outstanding guides--Bernadette (Detti) and Adam. They really added to the tour, providing quite a bit of history and engaging in lively social commentary with the group. They were both genuinely interested in ensuring the tour was enjoyed by all and really made the tour outstanding. STRONGLY recommend this tour."

Unfortunately, this tour was a huge disappointment. The tour guide (Frank) was unenthusiastic and rode his bike so slowly that the group couldn't even keep their bikes upright, and not everyone could make it through the urban street lights in time. He did not wait for those who got left behind and did not apologize for doing so, either. He made a racist joke during the tour and then laughed about the fact that it was racist - my friend and I thought it was extremely inappropriate. The points of interest that we went to were nice, but their descriptions were very underwhelming and did not do the city justice. I would suggest a bike tour, just not this one."

Balint is a great guide with loads of knowledge without which we would not have had as good an experience.

A nice bike trip through Budapest, with a guide who knows a lot, and is also not afraid to share her personal opinions about history, the current state etc. In other words: Hungary and Budapest are, like all other countries, not perfect....Thank you for the wonderful trip. Unfortunately the weather (tropical showers) cut the second part of the trip short... but still a great experience, definitely to be recommended to others!"

As a stag do group of 11 from Great Britain we were looking for a slightly calmer day out as an alternative to the late nights and irresponsible drinking common to Brits Abroad stag dos.What we didn't count on was the absolutely enchanting Christy as our tour guide. Her wit and charm were surpassed only by the most amazing smile with which inspired every one of us fell head over heels in love. The single ones that is. The others thought only of their lovely other halves back home. Just in case they're reading this. I'd recommend the Segway tour for any occasion. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll learn a thing or two. You'll definitely fall in love."

However after five minutes of tuition with Hunor we felt a lot happier, and by the time we had completed the little training exercises on the Segway (turns, and going up and down small kerbs) we felt happy to get started. If you haven't tried a Segway before - give it a go, it is really easy from young (14 years old) to middle-aged (48 years old) and I'm sure someone in their 60s could manage it easily.Because we were on a private tour and had already spent a few days walking around Budapest we asked Hunor if he could think of a route that would be more fun than a normal tourist guide tour. He took us on a great route through the city and out to Margaret's Island. We had time to tour most of the Island before heading back all with big grins on our faces!"

The short stop at a local restaurant to sample some strudel was something the other bike tours we had taken in other countries did not include. Brigit's English is excellent and she included humor and little known facts about some of the stops, like telling us about the many movies the Opera house area had been used for filming. The bikes are good quality bikes; all we did was show up with our cameras and took off for a casual trip around the city, and now we have a lifetime of memories."

We had two two guides who were excellent. The use, safety features of the Segway were described and demonstrated well and we each had a practice. The knowledge of Budapest was exceptional and put across in a very interesting way. It was a wonderful two and a half hours. Budapest is a really beautiful city and to explore and see it on a Segway was fantastic. I am over 60 and was a little worried I was too old to do this sort of thing. No way. It is better than walking! Hope to do it again."

The guide, Adrienn gave a brief summary of Hungarian history which really helped to understand the city. She tailored the length of time at each stop to our needs, she was happy to take photo's and answer questions. The stop for traditional Strudel was perfect, near the end of the tour, by which time you have worked up an appetite. The cycle is all on flat ground and relatively easy, although it is quite long there are plenty of stops to break it up and the time flew by. We felt very safe even though some cycling is on the roads. I really recommend this as a way of getting to know a city and much cooler than walking on a hot day. Tip: eat breakfast before you set off."

It was a last minute decision and we booked on the day, given we had a few bits we still wanted to see close up but were flying home the next day.When we got there, we were the only two people booked on the tour so everything was worked around us. We had a Segway familiarisation to make sure we felt comfortable handling it before the tour guide took us touring round the sights. We visited all the main attractions and it was quite interactive rather than just being spoken at for two hours. The evening tour is the only one to visit Margaret Island, and the guide told us that it was normally quieter in the evening so the tour can be more customised to you, so if there are things you want to see that aren't too far out of the way, deviations from the normal route can be permitted.The only downside to the Segways, and it isn't anything to do with the company, is just that standing up for so long can start to ache your back and knees a bit. Our guide let us stop and stretch our legs whenever we wanted, so again, I cannot fault them for making sure you're as comfortable as you can be.If you're off to Budapest and want to be shown a few of the sights rather than have to go around and see them yourself, and be given a pretty decent history of what you're seeing, then I whole heartedly recommend taking a tour with Yellow Zebra. If Segways aren't your thing, they also do walking and bike tours."

We just felt our guide could have been a little more enthusiastic about his city and bring some of the history to life (something we've experienced during other bike tours). The ratio of cycling versus interesting stops is also quite cycling heavy (it's not difficult fitness wise but we just would have preferred more stops as we passed interesting looking sights).

The tour starts with a trip along Andrassy Boulevarde to Heroes Square. Tomaz likes his history and facts; at the Heroes Square stop he was able to give a potted history of Hungarian history that was very interesting to listen to. The tour then makes it way through beautiful City Park and past Szechenyi baths. The route then takes in St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica, Libertrty square and Parliament. There is a then a cycle along the Danube to see Matthias Church, the Royal Palace and the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion. We then crossed over to the Buda side at Margit Bridge. We then cycled along the river to the Liberty Bridge to get back to the Pest side. There was a stop along the way to eat strudel. I thought that this would be uninspiring, but the strudel was absolutely delicious, and the stop for a coffee and a rest was a pleasant thing to do. We made lots of stops along the way. Tomaz kept a good pace, both in terms of our speed and the amount of detail that he was able to give throughout the tour. He's a very open guy who answered every question put to him. He was engaging and charming throughout the tour. I learned a lot from Tomaz and was inspired to visit a a charming little bookstore on Kiraly Street to buy a couple of good English-language books on modern Budapest or Hungarian history. We covered a lot of ground on the day. Zebra's website says 16km. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a little bit more than that. Budapest is very flat so the ride was very doable. Yellow Zebra's bikes have three speeds and they are very comfortable to ride on. The tour was a great introduction to Budapest's history and the geography of the city. If you were only in Budapest for a short period of time this would be an ideal way to get a sense of the place. If you were there for a little longer, it would be a good activity to do on your first day. You see a lot and you learn a lot. At the end of the tour Tomaz made a point of helping each of us with things like restaurant and attraction recommendations. He really takes his role as an ambassador of his city serious. This is a well put together tour that is operated by a nice team of people at Yellow Bikes. Tomaz, thanks for a great day out in your beautiful city."

The bike Budapest event which closed many streets was a real bonus for access plus a spectacle for us to b part of. Thank u Adrienn."

Our guide was very informative, & gave us a tour around the Jewish Quarter. He was professional and caring making sure if there was anything we needed or anywhere else we wanted to go. We all enjoyed our two hour tour but found it expensive for what it was. \u00a355 each."

There were six in our party ages 12,14,15,16 and two adults. This was the fourth city we were visiting on our trip, so we decided to change things up and do a Segway city tour. This was the first time any of us had been on a Segway. The younger kids and the adults were a bit tentative during our training, but as soon as the tour started, we got the hang it of it and felt very comfortable. We did the two-hour tour, which was perfect for us. I will caution parents to ensure that all follow instructions. The 15 year-old in our group fell off in a very crowded area, primarily because he did not follow the instructions our tour guide gave. He was ok, but he or someone else could have easily gotten hurt. I would recommend this to all and specially to families with teenagers. Adam, our tour guide was great! We saw a lot of the key sites in Pest and Adam tailored the amount of information he gave us based on our level of interest."

The boys loved it and Budapest's wide sidewalks afforded plenty of room for us to maneuver and enjoy the sites. A big round of applause and thanks to our excellent guide Ferenc (Frank) for the great 2 hour tour around the city. He was very informed, told great stories, and provided lots of unique insight on the many places we visited. In short, I would highly recommend Ferenc at Yellow Zebra tours.Ps - he's also a concierge of sorts as he booked a table for us at a great Hungarian restaurant."

Our guide, Robert was very friendly, well-informed and was possibly the best guide you could ask for. We had a 30 minute training session. Robert made sure we all were comfortable and had enough practice before we started the actual tour. The tour was brilliant. We saw Budapest in an entirely new light. I would suggest this for anyone who wants to experience a novel way of touring a city. After the tour, the office was kind enough to treat us to a nice hot cup of tea! Must also mention that the staff in office was also friendly and easily approachable. They took all precautions to ensure that no one had a bad Segway experience."

Well organised and an unrushed experience on well-kept equipment.The tour itself is less about the Segway riding than a bit of a history tour - although this could be more down to the individual guide. personally i would've preferred something a bit more fun than a school-type tour. It would also have been nice to been offered a photo opportunity of me and my partner. Admittedly we could have asked - but it wasn't until after the tour ended that we suddenly realised we didn't have any of us together.Overall though, a decent experience."

George was our tour guide and he has invaluable knowledge of the city and presented this is an interesting and humorous way. We were only in Budapest for 4 days and doing the Segway tour on our first morning was a great way to help us get our bearings, see the sights and decide our itinerary for the rest of the week.We particularly liked the parliament buildings and Szabadsag Ter. After the tour we sat in the office for around half an hour talking further with George about places to see as well as other staff members who all seemed lovely.We would have done the longer tour but unfortunately as we visited in February we were not able to. We would recommend wrapping up warm if it is a cold and windy day as it did get very cold! I wish I had have had a wind proof jacket and extra pair of socks!Thanks George, Pippa and Adam"

Even though the weather was horrible, (it pretty much rained for all of the tour), Balint was so enthusiastic and friendly. He shared his detailed knowledge of his home city with us, and he was willing to answer the many questions I asked. His English was fantastic, even to the extent that he was able to joke in English. This was the first day of our holiday, and what a great start to the holiday it was.Many thanks Balint."

The segways are really easy to ride once you get the hang of them and are great fun!Then it was off to see the sites. The Basilica, The Holocaust Memorial, Parliament square, the river and the Synagogue.It is a two hour tour and Petra, our guide, was great: Friendly, knowledgeable and happy to help.

The rain meant it was only the two of us for the tour which was a bonus.Brigit took us to a number of sites around the city and we learned a lot from her about the history of Hungary and its landmarks.

I will say, if you're doing the 3 hour Segway tour in the winter, wear triple the layers you think you'll need on your feet and hands. Since you're standing completely still for so long, you forget that you don't have the movement to keep circulation going in your extremities and your last hour might get miserable if you're distracted by cold. We got to see a lot of spots and learn some new facts about the city."

He made it look so , very patient and very amicable , through out.

We had a very good training session on the segways before tour and we did not venture out until Robert was sure we had mastered the art of Segway safely and we were comfortable the equipment and safety issues. We stopped on several occasions for photos and had a 10 min coffee break (which I loved) at a local Hungarian caf\u00e9.

Sightseeing in cities is always best done by bike and as we were riding with Bogota, it snowed for about 15 minutes which made the tour even more epic! Bogota took us to several different locations and gave us the perfect amount of historical information on each place. We were supposed to ride to the Buda side of the city, but it was cold and wet and Bogota was more than accommodating by granting our wish of going to the pub instead!! We wanted to see one of Budapest's ruin bars and she went out of her way to take us to such a cool one! That was one of the highlights of the trip! We then finished off the tour in a lovely caf\u00e9 eating delicious strudel and drinking a tasty coffee. Thank you Bogota for such an interesting afternoon, you are an awesome person, we had alot of fun and will definitely do it all over again next time!"

As we have travelled on segways before we thought we'd have lots of fun, and be able to see Budapest. However, the tour guide was a huge let down. There were two incidents which stood out during the two and a half hour tour. One was that during one trip through the Christmas market, one of the other members of our tour fell off his Segway and our tour guide didn't realise until members of the public alerted him. As we were in a busy market place this could be understandable however as an experienced tour guide you would think he would have noticed that a member of his group had injured themselves. He did eventually come back to help that person up, but by then the damage was done. Later on as we were crossing a busy road, another member of the tour had a problem with her Segway, which caused it to shut down. He had told us about this and had said to dismount the Segway and hold on to it. However as we were halfway across the road at the time assistance should have been available. When I saw this happen I tried to quickly turn around to help her and nearly fell off my own Segway. We managed to get the Segway next to the curb but couldn't pull it up as the wheels had locked. By this point the traffic had started up again, so I couldn't cross the road to try and tell the guide what had happened. My friend in front of me, meanwhile had seen what had happened and was trying to chase down the tour guide to tell him to go back. By that point he was about 300 yards up the next road. He'd carried on on his bike completely oblivious to what had happened behind him. As we were on a busy road at the time, this was totally unacceptable. We could have been in a dangerous situation and the tour guide would not have been able to get back to us quickly enough.I have been on a segway tour with another company in another city and not once did I feel unsafe. On this tour I felt that the tour guide was in his own world and didn't seem to be paying attention to where we were behind him. There were times when I was at the back of the group and couldn't even see him. There were other times when we had to wait on one side of the road (as we couldn't cross due to a red light) and he had disappeared on the other side!! I've never felt so unsafe as part of a group, and seeing as there were only six of us it shouldn't have been that hard to keep checking that we were all together and following behind him. Although I enjoyed seeing all the sights of Budapest, I would never want to go on a tour with this company again as I would like to feel that the tour guide was at least aware of what I and others around me were doing. On an unrelated note, I would also recommend trying to find a way to let us take photos of the sights. We were only able to get off the segways at two points in the tour, and I would have loved being able to take photos of the different sights."

At first I was very scared of the Segway but at the beginning they teach you how to ride and really make sure you are comfortable with being on the segway. Budapest is very rich in history. I learned quite a lot during this tour and it was not boring thanks to our wonderful tour guide Anita! I highly recommend this Segway tour it's fun and informative."

We saw parts of Budapest that we wouldn't have seen on the tour bus so we are so glad we did it! Adrianne (hope i got the name right) was our guide and she was very knowledgeable, we couldn't have had anyone better..she gave us tips on places to go and eat in after the tour, let us have a break and some Hungarian street food whilst on our tour and also had hot tea ready for us when we got back..she was great! It was one of the best things we did whilst being out there! Ps once u get the hang of how to ride the segway, its a piece of cake."

I took the tour of Pest with Tomas. An amazing guy. Makes the trips fun, exciting and educational. There should be a surcharge to book with this guy. Went again along the Buda castle. Segway makes it but no Tomas. Big points to yellow zebra for the hassle free bike rental too and all the advice. Plus you'll should get marketing kicks from Segway because I will be buying one now. Lol, I think Tomas sold it to me."

The bikes were in good condition and comfortable to ride for the several miles we put in for the day. We stopped at various places around the city before venturing further. I was impressed by Bogata's knowledge and friendly nature, she helped make the day very enjoyable and looked after us. We had plenty of opportunities and reasons to stop for photos and I particularly loved Margaret Island, how could you not!Great langos in Szentendre and then some time to explore for ourselves was lovely, we found a very relaxed pub for a beer in the garden out the back, lavendar ice cream, plenty of souvenir shops and a very relaxed and social vibe. We then took the river boat to cruise back to Budapest so got to see things from a new aspect. Overall it was a very enjoyable day and I'd always recommend bike travel to see a city...and especially one with little altitude like Budapest!"

Group of six taken out by guide with a fifteen minute instruction first. For the next forty minutes or so speed was limited to 5 kph after that limit removed so you could do 20 kph. Tour guide was knowledgable about Budapest but also responsible in the way he lead the group. Highlight had to be Margaret island, beautiful at this time of year and n easy way of having a quick view of dancing fountains, Japanese garden and the general area."

I'd never ridden a Segway before but our instructor, Adrienn, was so patient and kind - she made sure everyone in our group was comfortable with the machines before we headed off. The tour of Budapest was great and Adrienn was very informative, telling us all about the history of this beautiful city. Our hotel was based right by the Danube and it only took us about 10/15 mins to walk (casual stroll) to the opera house to reach the Segway tour offices. Would highly recommend it as a way to see the sights - we even became an attraction ourselves to some Japanese tourists who wanted to take our photos lol. Wonderful city, great tour guide, great way to spend a few hours. Many thanks so much Yellow Zebra!"

George (pronounced Dijorge) did a pleasant job of guiding us around the city. His passion and knowledge of Hungarian history was remarkable and was willing to answer any questions which a few were thrown at him. He did not hesitate nor shy away from explaining the bad part of the Hungarian history and threw in some of his views which was refreshing especially being a local guide. Sometimes local guides tend to focus on the good things...not George.The tour also provided a stop at a cafe/restaurant where we had coffee and snack which is free and included in the tour. All in all we recommend Yellow Zebra and George as a tour guide. The only negative thing I will point out is sometimes George may forget to look back to check to make sure no one is falling behind as he goes from site to site but not really an issue to be honest. Price: 10/10 (we got it slightly cheaper by booking via an affiliate called Absolute Tours).Enjoyment: 9/10 Guide: 9/10Recommend: Yes and ask for George"

Brigit did a good job of educating us on Hungarian history. In the spirit of full disclosure, after two and a half hours of being on a Segway, you are pretty tired. It doesn't look like you're doing anything, but standing and balancing still wears you out. That said, we had a blast and would do it again!"

It was mine and my partners first time in Budapest and his birthday, so I wanted to do something special- and this certainly was!We had limited time in the city and I wanted to make sure we didn't miss any of the key bits. As it was a special trip I booked the private (one-on-one) segway tour, lasting 2 hours. As you can appreciate it was more expensive but it was DEFINITELY worth every penny. We were very early but sat in a lovely coffee shop- also adjacent to the opera house- and had a 'pick me up' before first time Segwaying (is that even a word??). Our tour guide, Anita, was great!!It was my first time on a Segway and Russell hadn't done it for years. We had a great tutorial and then headed off. I was a chilly day but the excitement of using the segway in between stops helped you forget about it. We saw all the main sites and Anita told us funny little stories and anecdotes as we went. On her advise we took in the panoramic views of the city atop the St Stephens Basilica- a must do!So thank you Yellow Zebra Tours and, most importantly, Anita. It really was a great introduction to a beautiful city!"

Once we had done the safety bit and learnt the basics of the Segway (15 mins) don't know if this is normal but we just found riding the Seway very simple.The tour took around 2 1/2 hours and we covered all of the major sights in that time. Tomaz new his stuff a mixture of facts, history and humour is a winning combination, we even had time for just playing around On the Segway. But all this fun had to end and we arrived back at the office, even then Tomaz was keen to make sure we had no further questions.I would highly recommend this as a great fun way to seeing the sights and my wife was grinning for days and even started to look at buying a Segway on line, wish me luck."

We booked this Segway Tour online before arriving in Budapest having been on previous tours in Prague as well as Nice and Berlin (with other companies). Booking was very easy and directions to the meeting point good. Although we had been on Segways before the guide took time to ensure all were competent before setting off on what was the best tour we have experienced. There was one person who had not been on a Segway before and he took time to reassure and encourage her and by the end she was as good as any of us!.We went for the superior tour that lasted over 3 hours but was very interesting and fun. Our guide, Laszlo was really informative, enthusiastic and relaxed giving us plenty of opportunity to experience the joys of the Segway. Being able to zoom around Heroes Square was wonderful.After 20 minutes the speed limiters were off yet all were fully in control and enjoyed probably the best way to see this beautiful City. I would strongly recommend this tour and this Company. We did see other \"Segway\" tours but they were not using proper Segways (they had Chunky Wheels) and some did not provide helmets, which is not something you want!Overall this tour made our visit and many thanks to Laszlo who clearly loves his country and this came across in his guidance, many thanks from the people from Scotland as our accents were a challenge. Overall rating is Excellent."

Me and a friend really wanted to try out Segways whilst in Budapest. The reviews on trip advisor were all really positive so we went with it. We turned up Sunday afternoon and got a space on the evening slot which started at 6pm.18,000 huf per person for 2 hours + 30 minute training. Works out about \u00a340 roughly. We were greeted by Adam, who honestly made the whole experience amazing. Intelligent, friendly and welcoming with a solid knowledge of the city. The training Segway was difficult to use and we were a little unsure at first with how easy they were gonna be to use but once you're on the real ones they're surprisingly easy to use! Once you get the feelers it's quite natural. There were only 4 of us on the evening tour but this made it more intimate and I personally found it so enjoyable. We were so happy to have chosen the evening slot because the city looks stunning at sunset. So picturesque. My only regret is that we didn't rent Segways on our first day in the city as it is an amazing way to see the sites in a short amount of time and it's a real value for money. We visited all the big landmarks, stopped a few times at key areas and Adam told us facts and stories about the city. Would genuinely recommend doing this to anyone and everyone. My first ever Segway tour and I'll 1000% be doing this in other cities. Such a good experience, a lot of fun, good value for money and the high ratings are deserved. Seriously ended our visit on a high!"

This a great way to get a comprehensive look at the city. Learning to navigate a Segway only takes a few minutes. We started with the Opera House, over to St. Stephens, the Parliament, Hero Square, around to the Danube. So much Fun!! Highly recommend this to everyone. Our guide was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the city."

No problem the lady said just turn up tomorrow at 11 am- so we did.There were about 16 in the group and it was the 4 hr with strudel and coffee tour.Lovely day in Budapest for cycling not too hot.The staff were very good at setting the height of the saddle and showing how to operate the gears (but you really don't need to use the gears).The tour took us past all the major attractions but we did not go into any. It gives you a wonderful introduction to the modern history and also the ancient history of the city.The ride was very gentle but you do go along some of the major boulevards and streets which can be a bit tricky but the tour leader was excellent in managing this part of the tour.We stopped for a strudel and coffee (incl) and by the end of the 4 hours we had covered all the major sites (except the Jewish quarter).I real recommend this tour to anyone looking for a relaxing and informative guide through this beautiful city."

Our group was from 35-65 years old. It took 15-20 minutes to get accustomed to the Segway. I hadn't used one in a couple of years. Good instruction by the staff and by the time we were home 3 1/2 hours later, we were all Pros. We were able to visit many places because one can cover a LOT of ground on a Segway. We rode on curbs, the bike lanes in the street and went crazy around Hero Square. I am zipping around the walking Tour groups at about 20 mph and having a ball. \"Detti\" was great and I will do a Segway Tour my first morning in any City I visit from now on. We started at the OPera House and went all the way on the other side of City park stopping along the way. From there we went all the way back to the Danube and back up to the OPera House. We were gone for 3 1/2 hours and I enjoyed every second."

He was a local and very knowledgeable and friendly - he knew a lot about Hungarian history and told us loads of interesting stories. We saw a lot in a short space of time, but didn't feel rushed because the Segways made it easy to get around and were quite speedy.

Just behind the State Opera, this is a very friendly outfit which also doubles as a secondhand English bookshop.Budapest is a surprisingly cycle-friendly city and we hired bikes on two of our three days to pootle about visiting the places we'd identified as worth checking out. The great thing about the bike was that if it turned out to be disappointing you would soon be at the next place of interest.Only criticism was that if you get a puncture you're stuffed: you'd have to walk back! Also there were no lights offered even though the day hire was until well after dark."

            "review": "A fun way to see Budapest . We considered a bike or walking tour around the city, yet we chose to do the Segway tour instead as neither of us had used one before and they looked like great fun. We chose to do the 2 1/2 hour tour which includes an introductory training session on how to use the Segway. The members of staff conducting the training were extremely helpful and patient and ensured everyone felt comfortable using the Segways before the tour began. Our tour proved a great way to see the city in one morning due to the abundance of sights that we passed and gave good insight into attractions we may have wanted to revisit, which we did throughout our trip. We covered a lot of the main attractions of Budapest during our Segway tour and we were provided with information from our guide surrounding the significance of each attraction to the city. Our guide Balint was great fun and taught us about the history of Budapest in a way which made us want to know more. During the tour, and after the tour had finished, he provided us with more information (location of ruin pubs, good restaurants and places that are popular with locals) which was also very useful.Overall, the Segway tour was a great way to see the main attractions of Budapest and we would recommend this tour at the beginning of a trip to Budapest as it allows you to decide what attractions you want to revisit. Additionally, if you have never used a Segway before then it is a fun way to explore a new city."

They offer a guided tour too, but I opted to simply hire the bike and go my own way - but the choice is yours. Thought they were outstanding value, it's a great central location and the staff are helpful and friendly (even when I changed my mind from booking and paying for the tour, to just going it alone!). The bike is basic - only a three-speed sit-up-and-beg, but it's perfect for zooming round Budapest and taking in the sights, and it's a bargain price too. I was served by a lady named Viki who was very helpful. I hadn't booked ahead - just called in on the off-chance, but was soon set up and on my way in no time. Oh and you can pay by the hour if you only want to rent for a short period, or by the day, or even overnight, so there are very flexible options to suit anyone's plans. There's wifi at their offices too. All in all, wouldn't hesitate to recommend these guys. It's a fun, economical and great way to see the city. Do it!"

We had booked on Expedia, who offered only a 2 hour tour. The rest of the group had booked a 3 hour tour. For only 14 euros more per person, we upgraded to the 3 hour tour.

A fabulous way to see the city, and Balint provided lots of interesting background on all the sights, and the history of the city. There is a lot to see in Budapest, and seeing it on a Segway is a very efficient and a lot of fun. I booked on my iphone the day of the tour, but I think that we got lucky. Suggest that you book a couple of days in advance if you can. It is easy to learn how to drive a Segway (it was our first time) and we learned quickly. Balint was very careful to give us proper lessons. Our son is 13 years old, and we felt comfortable with him on the Segway given the training. An evening adventure meant that we had an opportunity to take photo's of all the beautifully lit up buildings and bridges. We also saw a part of the light show at the fountain on Margaret Island. Strongly recommend this . . . ask for Balint - he was fun and very knowledgeable!"

The segways are really easy to master once you start and are a lot of fun. We booked in advance online so ended up paying 43 pounds each which we thought was a great deal. We went round st. stephens, liberty square and margit island as well as a few others and our guide, Tamas, was really knowledgeable on the history, telling us everything we wanted to know! I would really recommend doing this!"

We had a lot of fun!We had booked the tour from home over the Internet so, all we needed to do was to get to the shop. It is located just behind the Opera House on the Pest side. After some minutes spent reviewing the safety measures, we were on our way.We are a family of five and we have travelled in Europe for the last few summers. This to explain that we knew some of the history of Budapest, the Austro-hungarian history and the likes. Despite this, Balint took it in stride and hopped us around the city, testing our knowledge and making fun along the way. His comments were interesting, testing one kid or the other and generally making us understand the city and country more. We had a great time!We had forgotten to bring water with us, but the shop sold some at a very reasonable price. Bring your camera as there are bags attached to the Segway to store them. And, as one of kids said, the Segway tour is a good way to get A/C... It was 36 degrees Celsius on that day."

We were a group of 7 (6 of us booked together and one guy on his own). The training section was comprehensive and not too long. It was also location specific, teaching us how to go up and down kerbs which I had never done before. The tour covered lots of famous Pest landmarks and our guide Thomas (I may have spelled that wrong) was superb; excellent English and very knowledgeable. He was also very good natured, good fun and friendly. He was animated, interesting, responsive to what we as a group wanted and made it a great tour. I've done lots of Segway tours all over the US and in Europe and this was honestly the best we've done so far; mainly because of Thomas' skills as a guide."

Due to the hot weather in the city (36 degrees) I turned out to be the only costumer for that tour! And luckily they didn't cancel, but instead I got a private tour with guide Robi. He was the best! He took me to see almost every place of interest in the city centre and told me everything I wanted to know about the history of the city and about more recent happenings. He also gave me great tips for dinner and drinking places! I would recommand doing this bike tour as the first activity in the city.

It started off at 11AM, and what was supposed to be a 3.5 hour tour ended up being more like a 4.5 hour (yay). Had a great time. Adrienn really knew her stuff, was very friendly, and was good at explaining. She was even keen on making sure we got the best advice on the rest of our Budapest stay - pointed us areas with good foods and shopping.We were also very lucky - the weather was nice and sunny, but also cool. I highly recumbent this tour. For 33 USD, a 4.5 hour bike tour (though it WAS intended to be 3.5 hour) with high-end bikes and an excellent tour guide like Adrienn is a steal. To top it off, the tour includes a little visit to a coffee shop, with complimentary Strudel and drink. The Strudel was awesome. (We each got two, but partially because the group was small.) The group had a nice relaxing time at the coffee shop after biking around Budapest. Take all this into account - definitely a good price.I would highlight the following:- important to book on a day with good weather (if summer, make sure it's not too hot)- GREAT price- Adrienn did a superb job, and I suspect the other tour guides there are equally good- solo/family/couple, all groups will have a great time- bring water (especially if during the summer)- the starting point can be hard to find. The bike shop is right behind the Opera House, which is on Andrassy Avenue- highly recommend doing this on the first or second day in Budapest, because the tour gives you a good overview of Budapest, and you learn about places you can potentially visit. Further, the tour guide really helps you out (during the coffee break). Adrienn made sure we were informed where to eat/shop, where not to, what to do during weekends, etc.One word to summarize: awesome."

Also, wear comfortable shoes like trainers as Segways are not as easy/comfortable as you might think, especially after a few hours!We were visiting Hungary for five days, but three of those were at the Formula One Grand Prix, so this was an excellent and efficient way to see lots of sights in a morning and pick what we might want to return to in the afternoon for a longer visit.Thanks Balint!Heidi and Gary"

The segway when you first get on it feels totally alien and unnatural. By the time we had all finished our training session, we headed off with trepidation to the first stop on the tour. George was very patient with all of us and by the time that we were listening to his first speech in front of the opera house it started to feel natural. As we started to make our way through the city we were all smiling our heads off and thoroughly enjoying the tour. George is very passionate about his city and this showed in the knowledge and depth of his talks as we stopped in front of the major sights. By the end of the tour, we were all very proficient and confident in the use of the segway and would have liked more time.If you are thinking about this, from our perspective it is a must do as you get to see and feel the city and Yellow Zebra have the most current and up to date machines for use. We would definitely do this again and will now try it in Krakow next year when we go again. Thanks George for a very enjoyable trip."

Viktor was our guide and very charming. He lent a personal perspective to the tour that is good for Westerners to hear. I can't think of a better way to get an overview of the Pest side of town. I don't know if this tour goes to Buda - we had a longer tour and just hit the Pest sites. We came away with a wonderful appreciation of this city and were able to see so much more than we could have by foot. Here are my minor reservations: you should be already comfortable on a Segway. They don't spend much time training. My husband and I are, so no problem for us. The history that you get is a very thin overview and in some areas really should be verified - local myth, holdovers from communist information control still exist. However, that is easily done - just be aware."

Viktor was great - very knowledgable and approachable with questions - we learnt so much from him and he had a joke and a laugh with us all. The tour lasted about 2.5 hours with stops for photos, drinks etc. Viktor was even able to give us all recommendations for food, drinks etc. Loved this tour and will be using Yellow Zebra again! thanks guys for a great city tour :)"

Myself and a friend booked the 2 hour segway tour for our 2nd day in Budapest, to get some history on the city and help to get our bearings.Our tour guide was Balint, who introduced himself as we arrived and took us outside the office for a guide and practice runs on the segways. I was the only one in the group who had been on a segway before, admittedly only on another 2 hour trip, but the rest of the group picked it up really quickly. We were taught how to tackle kerbs correctly, and Balint made sure we could all do it correctly, without injuring ourselves or damaging the segway, before we set off on the tour. We were set on turtle mode for the first bit, until everyone got the hang of using the segway. Once we had been out for about 20 mins? or so, and we had got to St Stephen's Basilica, we were taken off turtle mode and let loose in the square to make the most of our new found speed freedom. Each group has a tour guide and a chaperone who stays at the back of the group to make sure no one gets left behind - which was good as my friend didn't make a corner properly as we left the square, crashing and ultimately falling off. The chaperone (sorry, can't remember his name!) Made sure she was ok and set off to rejoin the rest of the group.Balint was a really good tour guide; informative and interesting, making light of some of the city's history and background. Some tour guides can be stuffy and waffle on, but Balint had the right balance to make the tour fun and interesting... thank you Balint!After the tour was finished, my friend and I spent the afternoon retracing the route we had been on and revisited some of the sites like Parliament and the Basilica that we couldn't get too close to, or visit inside with having the segways.A really fun 2 hours, with a bit of a workout included! I would totally recommend this as a great way to see the city, learn some of the history and be able to zip about on a segway! Safe to say the American tourists we passed loved them!"

We booked a 3 hour personal tour and covered a lot of ground during that time. Robert is informative, engaging and also very safety conscious. Although the tour was 3 hours long, he extended it as he wanted to show us the magnificent Parliament House and that was a little out of the way. We thought that was very nice of him. I highly recommend a segway sightseeing tour in any city that has it as it saves you so much time. Zip through all the major attractions and if you really like it, you can always come back on your own later."

The guide continued training the members of the group while I tried to convince daughter to give it another try. That did not work she would not go and though the company said she could sit with them my 11 year old daughter did not feel comfortable sitting in a foreign country with people she did not know for 3 hours. My son continued on the trip but I had to sit out with my daughter and was not refunded a cent so we got one for the price of three. Personally for me this is much to expensive to risk so unless you are experienced I don't know that I would risk that much money."

After a brief familiarisation, we were off into a busy city centre on a Saturday afternoon. The segways are quite sensitive but relatively easy to operate if the balance is mastered, although the lack of a \"brake\" is a little disconcerting. Fortunately, personal safety is a high priority with Yellow Zebra, as, unlike some other providers in the city, a helmet is issued and is required to be worn. In the light of our experience, when (unfortunately) yours truly inadvertantly turned his own machine into that of his wife, whilst waiting at a pelican crossing, the helmet is crucial. Due to my carelessness, my wife fell and cracked her head on the pavement and would have been seriously injured without the helmet. She was able to continue, but I would urge all participants to keep a healthy distance between their own segway and those of other \"riders,\" especially close relatives ! Our experience should not reflect badly on yellow Zebra Tours, as the issues were of my own making, but the need to steer clear of any obstacles should be stressed, particularly for the less mobile \"senior citizen!\""

The route was easy to follow, with Balint helping us cross roads, negotiate traffic lights and deal with pedestrians. We'd stop regularly at the sights for photos and a history talk.You do sign a waiver and I understand why people would be worried. The Segways are sturdy but you do go on the road and it does take some practice. My friend fell off in the City Park when we tried to get up a particularly steep kerb. She was ok and Balint was a great help, but it was only after this that we though through other implications of an accident.Safe Segway riding!"

Firstly the groups are quite small, 8 in ours and you are given half an hour training before the tour starts, which isn't included in the tour time so you are comfortable using the Segway before you are launched onto the streets of Budapest. Once you set off the Segway is in training mode until your guide feels you are a competent driver!Our guide was Andi who was really knowledgeable and ensured we stopped at all the key sites and allowed plenty of time for photos throughout. Her english was excellent and she was able to answer questions during the tour. We were given some \"free time\" to just drive the Segways around as we wanted which was great fun and we were shown some things which we definitely wouldn't have discovered if we hadn't have been on the tour. Ages in our group ranged from 20 year olds to 60+ year olds.The segways do vibrate through your feet and they can feel uncomfortable by the end of the tour so I would recommend trainers so they take the impact."

Although we've already explored Budapest a bit, it was a great tour that enabled us exploring a large portion of Budapest, along with Segway motoric fun. Our guide - Balint - was very nice and patient, he gave us great tips as to what to do in Budapest and he was really considerate and flexible. The Segway is enjoyable since on one hand it is open and gives you the feeling as if you are a part of the city action (unlikely in buses) and on the other hand it is motoric and it makes it simple to have a long tour around the city with no big effort. We recommend this tour to anyone who is not afraid of motoric vehicles. We will surely try this again sometimes in other European countries. Balint - thanks a lot, Ran and Limor from Israel."

I wanted to see as much as I can one evening, so I hooked up with the good folks at Yellow Zebra for a cycle tour. It was a cloudy late afternoon but keen to see why Budapest been quoted as one of the extraordinary cities in Europe. I had the most informative by a very knowledgeable and lovely tour guide Brigit (one of the stories that told me about the Liberty Status will stick with me for life!) and breath taking 2 hours. I had learnt much and now can appreciate the vast history of this city."

Slow pace. Most of the tour is in bike lanes where you are not fighting cars. You will see so much of Buda AND Pest. I would do this first, then decide what to go back and see in more detail. You will be fortunate if you get George. His passion for his heritage, his knowledge of history and his consideration for tour members make him a wonderful guide.

Brigit, our guide, was friendly, personable and very insightful. She helped to make this a very enjoyable and enlightening experience. Our starting point was the Opera House and from there we biked down Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue, a world heritage site and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Budapest. We visited statues, parks, gardens, and baths. We biked across the Danube and back on two different bridges and rode past the impressive Parliament building, all while gaining an understanding of the culture from Brigit. The bike lanes are wide and well marked which makes it easy to follow the guide and gaze at the sites. There's even a refreshment stop along the way where we sampled the many flavors of Hungarian Strudel.The company no longer bikes up to the castle in Buda, so you will only experience Pest, but it's well worth it and highly recommended."

So much fun and such an easy and efficient way to get around all the best bits of the city. I would highly highly recommend the evening one, parlament and the basilica look BEAUTIFUL in the dusk! Our tour guide Andy was informative, funny and gave us a lot of great information and freedom on the segways! She was great!!! Thanks Andy, you made a great night even better!"

Christy, our guide, was first class and made sure we were all confident on the Segway before we started. She is very knowledgeable and answered any questions we asked, stopping several times at various sites whilst she told us some history and background info of the sites. This really is a good way to see the city and cannot recommend the tour enough. The last hour of the tour was fun as we went up to Heroes Square and the surrounding park...loved it thoroughly enjoyable and best way to see the city"

So I had quite an experience in all around the world. I absolutely recommend the 3 hours tour over 2 hours. It can be a bit exhausting but I'd be sorry if I had missed the sites we visited the last hour. A word for the tour guide as well: George was very knowlegable about the history, city and even trends. He was a kind, communicative guide, I believe made the tour even enjoyable. Thank you for the experienced and professional service."

From the first moment we arrived the staff were more than helpful (mostly helping by assuring my mother that the Segways were not at all dangerous). During the training session our guide was helpful, calm, and patient. Before long we were zipping along, feeling more comfortable with each passing minute. At each stop along the way, the tour guide shared some information that felt as though it was a little more detailed than your usual tour. It felt as though we were getting a behind the scenes look at one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The knowledge was specific, local, and, above all, interesting. I left the tour feeling as though I understood what Budapest was all about. I would highly recommend the tour for anybody who wants to a) scratch a segway tour off their bucket list, and b) anybody who wants to know more than they ever thought possible about the crown jewel of Central Europe."

            "review": "Bike tour, segway tour, and pub crawl in Budapest with Yellow Zebra. Last week we made online reservations directly with Yellow Zebra and signed up for a 4-hour bike tour of Budapest (11-3pm) and Pub Crawl (9pm-1am) on Tuesday, followed by a Segway tour (4:00-5:30) on Wednesday. We arrived for our bike tour on time and had a great experience with our tour guide Gabor Szabo! He was very well-informed and knows the city's history very well and makes it an enjoyable experience for everyone. Our group was very diverse and he was able to answer all of our questions and provide his opinion when asked about various political organizations in Hungary. He was kind enough to write down a few good Hungarian wine suggestions and authentic Hungarian restaurants near our apartment. We followed his suggestions which were absolutely perfect! The bikes were comfortable and the tour itself was interesting and not too exertive (for those of you that don't like to exercise too much...you will survive). I think it is best to do this tour on the first or second day of your trip. After the tour was over I double checked that the meeting point for the pub crawl that evening was \"meeting point number 1\" (as I was told when I made my reservation last week). It was lucky I asked because the meeting point was not where we were originally told and in fact we needed to go to a church (nowhere near the original meeting \"point #1\") and wait on the steps for our guide. I was then told that they don't do the pub crawl anymore so maybe they source it out...I'm not sure? Confusing and not very well organized ... The pub crawl itself was enjoyable and we had a VERY cool tour guide (I can't remember her name) who recommended various places in the city for us to visit based on our interests. The free drink provided at each bar was a joke (basically a tiny drop of vodka mixed with some form of fruit juice) as I was expecting something authentic/Hungarian etc... but it didn't REALLY matter as you can order additional drinks as you wish...but just need to pay for them. The bars they selected were pretty cool and provided us with a good sample of the local Ruin Pubs here in Budapest. Most of the people of the tour were in their 20's...we were by far the oldest...but it wasn't at all weird. Today was our Segway tour of the Buda side and we decided to go to the Yellow Zebra office again this morning just to confirm the meeting point - and AGAIN it was different from what we read when we made our reservations just last week. We had to change our afternoon plans because the meeting point was actually in Buda on the hill...not in Pest next to the Opera. In the end our tour guide for our Segway trip \"Andi\" created such a great experience that we will never forget. She was very professional and asked us a lot of questions so she could tailor the tour based on our interest level (i.e. more interested in history...or more interested in just having fun with the segway). It was our first time riding a Segway and she was able to show us quickly everything that we needed to know in order to be able to drive the Segway with confidence! :) She was super informative and able to provide all those interesting details and stories that make Budapest such an interesting place to visit. If you book a Segway tour with Yellow Zebra and want to learn a lot about the history - ask for Andi - she is the best! The tour guides on our bike tour, bar crawl, and segway tour were VERY good. However out of three tours booked with Yellow Zebra...they provided me with the incorrect meeting location and if it wasn't for the fact that I happened to ask them in person once we arrived in Budapest - we could have missed two out of three tours!!! When I kindly pointed out that other tourist like myself might be having the same problem - the girl at the front desk said she would be sure to forward the information to the people who are in charge of reservations. There was no formal apology that twice we were misinformed and no sign that they were sorry. I wasn't going to write a review, but I had to just because our tour guides deserve recognition for the great job they are doing. If I could.... I would give 5 stars for the tour guides and 1 star for the company, but that is not possible. So if you book with Yellow Zebra - just confirm you have the right meeting location! I think Yellow Zebra is overstretched and no longer deserves to keep the great reputation that they had in the past when they were just focusing on doing the bike tours. Now it seems like they are trying to do everything without the resources and have so many different companies covering so many different tourist entertainment/tour options that you don't know who you are really working with in the end."

Our daughter booked this segway tour of Budapest for us, something we wouldn't have booked ourselves but so glad she did, it was the BEST morning exploring, we had so much fun, laughing, enjoying the group and seeing the sights on two wheels. The segway is easy to manage, you're given a lesson and all ages can master it within a few minutes. Booked in the UK you pay commission but book it there (behind the opera house) is cheaper. Its safe and fun. The tour was 2 hours, extended to 2 1/2 by Victor who was extremely knowledgeable of the city and land marks but gave a deeply thought provoking touching talk on the last 100 years of Budapest and how his descendants from his parents back were affected by the communist regime, the wars, Nazi occupation etc, eye opening! This tour is great for the family, sensational historic tour with Victor who was the perfect guide. High;y recommend that you book this not only in Budapest but any city. Fantastic fun activity with history, it has it all for every age group. Than you Victor and we wish you well for your future."

Our first full day we got up promptly and went off for our 3 hour Segway Tour of the Pest side of the city.Our tour guide was Balazs, and he immediately put us at ease. I was a little concerned I would not be able to pick the art of driving one of these quickly, but I need not have worried. There were only 7 people in our group including my husband and I and we all picked it up very quickly. We had about half an hours training, which was just right.We then set off on the 2 hour tour. I really recommend this tour early on during your time in the city as it allows you to see so much in a short space of time. therefore if there are any areas you feel you would like to re visit, you can at a later time.Our guide seemed to be very knowledgeable and was very patient with us never rushing us on before we were ready. He also spoke very good English. He also seemed to time the tour just right with getting at certain places at the right time!!!We returned to the shop after 2 hours, had a little rest etc. and said goodbye to 2 people in our group who had only booked 2 hours. They were told that they could continued if they wished, but they chose not to as they were cold. I should mention here that I was absolutely shaking with the cold but was having such fun, it really didn't seem to matter!!We then went on for the rest of the tour.We left him, wanting longer and wanting to buy a segway over here. If only they were legal!At the end Balazs, told us about the other cities they do this in and I only have one criticism of him, and that is he did not tell us we could do a tour on a segway up on the Buda side of Pest!!!! And we only found this out when we had already walked round half of it.To some up!! The highlight of our weekend!!!"

So we chose this tour so we wouldn't have to walk all the areas in the above quote. About two thirds of the way through the tour we found out that we weren't going there. First they denied it was on their website. Then, once confronted with the fact that it is on their website, they claimed it was because their website is \"under construction\". The prices are off, too...Their website says if you book online it is 21 euros, but you are actually billed 22.50, that's not a big deal, but those two things together, to me, means either they are being purposefully deceitful, or just plain too lazy to correct their website. What a shame, because their tour guide was great, but I would have made other arrangements if I had known that I would end up missing the whole Buda side of Budapest.."

We rode around the main areas of Buda & Pest and half way through we stopped at a restaurant for a snack and some drinks. We had great views all around and our guide Thomas was fantastic! Will definitely recommend to friends that will be visiting in the future."

Some of us were nervous about being able to control the segway but decided to bite the bullet. Our tour guide, Anna, was fantastic and very patient and took the time to make sure we were comfortable before commencing. We took the two hour trip which is mostly pedestrianised. By the time it was over we felt like experts and have found our next Christmas presents lol. If you get the chance to try this out you won't be disappointed."

With experience of Segway tours we (couple 40s-50s) booked in UK prior to arriving in Hungary via Viator.Easy to find using Budapest map app on mobile phone- but right by Opera House so not difficult to find.We were given a warm welcome and introduced to our guide and mentor Laszlo who took our previous experience in to account. We were incredibly fortunate to visit early in the season and be the only 2 booked in- so a personal tour- wherever we wanted to go. Laszlo gave several suggestions and we chose music/theatre/opera district and travelled to Heroes Square, Park and as far as the Zoo.We were out for a good 2 hours + after ensuring we were competent on the Segways. Adequate instruction given and helmets provided. If you can stand and shift your weight- you can Segway.Attraction for us is the amount of ground you can cover in the time - we estimate we covered 6 km in a couple of hours.The Segways are in great condition- we were not at all concerned for our safety due to the quality of the kit.Laszlo showed interest in us as a couple, our background and lives- judging what sites would interest us. He guided us around, watching for our safety, and giving educated, relevant information on various buildings, architecture, historic events and influential characters from history both political and cultural. What made it special was that it was tailored to our needs, offered- not forced- we did not feel lectured or talked at. We felt that we had fallen on our feet, meeting a friendly local, gifted with so much knowledge of his home city and culture and willing to share it with us.Great tour- would thoroughly recommend- all ages and would suit most abilities. Give it a go- so much fun and the envy of walking tourist!"

And finally on our weekend away I was presented with an option \"we are doing it\". I am always scared of unknown that involves speed and not standing on my own two feet, so sure enough I was really anxious. When we arrived, our tour guide Tamas (Thomas) greeted us with a friendly smile and great energy, that anyone could envy... First we went through 30 min training on Segways. One by one we were shown and had to repeat some exercises from simplest move forward to jumping on and off the barrier. Tamas was great teacher. Explained everything in detail wrapping it into a humour for everyone's entertainment. In things like that the professionalism of the teacher is very important. It did not take us half an hour, just 20 minutes later we were all standing on our own Segways ready for a Segway Tour of Budapest. After proving to be a great teacher, Tamas was even better as a tour guide. Knowing history very well, he was explaining it in entertaining manner, with a questions and quizzes in between joyful rides on the streets of Budapest. Later on, after the tour, Tamas recommended us some great restaurants in the area, we were staying. We have visited 3 out of 4 recommended and each was worth recommendation. The whole experience was really amazing. Even cold weather didn't affect us too much. All I can add is - I highly recommend it, even if you are afraid for step on a Segway for the first time. If you can get Tamas as your tour guide, you will absolutely enjoy it! Thanks to Tamas & Yellow Zebra Segways Budapest for this great Segway Tour & experience! Looking forward to doing it again, next time we are in Budapest. Jurgita & Kieron (Ireland)"

From my (as tourist) point of view prices are acceptable, especially the deposit amount.We were given comfortable and lightweight bikes (with zebra in the front wheel).Renting a bike was the best idea ever, we saw places from Opera till Vaci street, over Liberty bridge up to the top of Gellert Hill and then to the Royal Palace and Matthias Church, over the Chain bridge back to the rental (behind the Opera).What a ride!In the rental now we were greeted with a friendly guy, who was positively surprised for all the places we have seen.The warmest greetings from Latvia and best wishes in the New Year to Reka and Szabi."

I'd say that exploring the city by bike is best as you can cover a lot of ground whilst also receiving an individualised tour. Anna made sure we all had our questions answered and gave us lots of tips about where to go to make the most out of our trip. Learnt some really cool things that we just wouldn't have without a local person's perspective! Recommended, even in the colder autumn months (just remember to take gloves!!) :)"

            "review": "Perfect Introduction to Budapest!. We decided to take a bike tour on our first full day in Budapest. We have done this before and find it a great way to get the history and background of the city together with our bearings for the remainder of the stay.We booked our tour online to guarantee our places, this also saved us 25%. Instead of 28 euro for each adult we paid 21 euro after discount. This is for a 4 hour tour inclusive of a trip to a caf\u00e9 for drinks and strudel. Children are 12 euro or 9 euro with discount.The daily tour starts at 11am and we turned up at 10.45am for an introduction by our guide Tomas who spoke impeccable English. All bikes are sized to suit and helmets are available. At first glance the roads of Budapest appear quite manic, but, there are extensive cycle paths and in many places cycles are separated from the main traffic system. We had our 12 year old daughter with us and we never had any concerns for her safety. Our tour consisted of 7 people plus Tomas. Tomas worked hard to keep the group together and ensured we were fully aware of any crossing points which were busy or difficult to negotiate.The tour lasted 4 1/2 hours and involved a lot of cycling interspersed with regular cultural/historical updates from Tomas. Thomas was quite happy to cycle at a pace dictated by the group however everyone on our trip was reasonably fit and the pace was brisk. The trip includes a visit to Buda Castle district which necesitates climbing over 90m in a relatively short distance. You need to be reasonably fit to get the most out of this tour and I would also recommend taking water as this is a 4 hour trip and it is easy to dehydrate, our group did stop to buy water half way up the hill to Buda castle.Thomas was an excellent guide, exceptionally knowledgeable, friendly and enthusiastic. We had a very enjoyable day and could not recommend this highly enough!"

The group of 10 were all English/Irish and her use of the English language was superb. For someone so young her knowledge of Hungarian history was first class. We learned a great deal from her. Most of the tour was on quiet streets/cycle lanes and even when we had to ride on a main road, a cycle lane was clearly marked so we never felt unsafe. In fact the only dangerous moment came when we cycled in front of the Parliament building and were promptly told off by armed guards! I would definitely recommend this excursion."

We were all Segway beginners, but a quick lesson was all that was needed. Our tour guide, Thomas, was knowledgable, professional, passionate and witty. He did a great job of including both kids and adults in the discussion. His enthusiasm was contagious and we ended up rolling back to the office as the sun was setting. The Yellow Zebra team seemed highly motivated and clearly like working together. The office doubles as a used English book store- so it's a great place to pick up a used guidebook. Later, we wished we had engaged Thomas for a walking tour the following day. I would highly recommend any tour offered by this company...but the Segways were really fun for all ages!"

There were 8 of us and we all had great bikes and it was relatively cheap too compared to the US. The bike Lock came with it and a basket to haul it in. It was very convenient location just around the corner from our hotel K+K hotels at the Opera. This location of the bike shop was a short ride from the paths on the Danube and the Basilca and the Baths. Try then out, we love this shop!"

It was more than a rehearsed kind of tour that I am usually accustomed to. She was friendly and genuinely interested in Budapest.Went to the main highlights on bike. One downside was we did not stop at some pretty interesting stops to take pictures. I suppose there is just too much to see so we couldn't stop everywhere. At the end of the day, the tour is worth it especially if you have no idea where or what you are looking at when traveling Budapest. Gives you a good introduction into the city."

With her local knowledge, great personality and people skills Bogata answered all of our questions while keeping the tour interesting and relevant. She also recommend additional actives like restaurants, the markets and cruises we could do throughout the city. I would recommend doing this tour on your first afternoon or morning in Budapest. It will give you a taste of the city and more things you want to visit or focus your time on. You see all the major monuments, areas, the palace, Fisherman's bastion and there is a coffee stop on the way to re-energise you. ***mostly the bike skill level you need is medium. You just need to know how to ride a bike, watch out for traffic and stop. The only part that is hard is the hill to the palace. But your hard work is so paid off when you get there. The guides will go at your pace and stop to wait for you on the hill. The bikes are comfortable, kept in good condition and helmets are available."

However we had done a tour in Berlin which she enjoyed so we signed up for this. Unlike Berlin the guide was a local so was able to provide a more personal view of the sights that we saw as we cycled around. There was a stop for pastries and coffee half way which was a welcome refresher. The ride up the hill was not that bad and everybody made it. The scariest part was the narrow roads and the buses going past but like the rest of Europe people treat cyclists with some respect. The only complaint was that the guide did not keep an eye or stragglers so the group got split several times. The last time we had no idea where the group had gone so started to make our own way back with some basic navigation skills. It would not have been hard to keep everyone in sight. Despite this we had a good time and would recommend this tour"

We spent a little over 4 hours with him touring Buda then over to Pest. The bike ride up the hill in Pest was a little challenging but not too bad. You need to know how to ride a bike and you will need to dodge some traffic particularly on the Pest side. We stopped for a break at a lovely cafe for beverages and sweets.

There were 6 of us in total on our tour, and it was so much fun. The bikes were really easy to cycle and comfortable too, which was a bonus. Budapest as a city was also great for bikes, and there was plenty of cycle lanes for us to use. Stopping for a coffee and a pasty (included in the relatively cheap price of the extensive tour) was a really nice touch too, as we got to chat together as a group and learn more about each other. I took my SLR camera on the bike tour with me and there was plenty of opportunity to stop and take some snaps, as well as hear about the history of a certain area, building, sight etc. It is an excellent way to explore the city and I would recommend it to anyone. The staff were also great, and very kindly rearranged our bike tour twice, due to a delayed start to the holiday due to closed airports and missed flights."

This is THE best way to get your bearings, and learn about this beautfiul, friendly city!Our guide BERNADETTE was super friendly and knowledgeable, and a lot of fun. She catered the tour to we wanted to see, and showed us many surprises along the way. She was also and excellent instructor, and the 7 of us only needed about 25 minutes to all get the hang of the tour.I highly recommend the private tours, because it's your own little adventure and memories this way. We saw so much, and we learned so much, and by the end of the 3.5 hours, we were having so much fun, we didn't want to get off!! It was 83* and we were wearing helmets, but we were not miserable at all! We kept moving, and that helped the heat. So I would say, even in the heat of summer, don't hesitate to do this! After 2 hours, BERNADETTE killed the \"turtle mode\" and we all could go a little faster. It's actually a little easier to handle the Segway out of the \"turtle mode.\" By the end, we were tired mostly due to the heat, but I think we could have easily done another hour, that's how much fun it was! So easy to learn, and not intimidating at all. It's really about where you place your feet and getting a sense of your balance. We had members of our groups with tricky knees and heavier posture, and none of us had ever done this before. (weight limit on a segway is 280lbs).  The shop has water and softdrinks for purchase for your outing as well. The Segways themselves have no real storage on them, so leave your bags. This tour company is great. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! This was the highlight of our trip, and we'd all do it again!"

I would have wished for more quirky insider stories, rather than the usual things one can read in guide books, but the tour did take us to many of the important sites in the city. It also included a refreshment stop at a coffee shop and the drink and pastry were paid for in the tour fee. The ride up the hill to the castle near the end is a little strenuous, but we had people on the tour who were overweight and out of shape and we just gave them a little extra time and they made it. Budapest is so large and sprawling that a bike is great way to see it, but I would recommend, if you can, do the tour on a weekend when the traffic is lighter."

Anna was extremely knowledgeable about the history of the area, and has excellent anecdotes and stories to accompany each of the stops on the tour. One of the best stop was a peek into the public baths in Pest- if you are going to Budapest when the weather is warm, and you have additional time to spare, be sure to pack a bathing suit and visit the baths, they looked amazing!Just a quick note: the tour includes a stop at a caf\u00e9, but the meal, which is at lunch time (and is included in the cost of the tour), only includes a beverage and dessert, so be sure to eat before leaving on the tour at 11 am- the tour is 4 hours long :) Also, don't forget your sunscreen if you're fair skinned- again, you'll be in the sun for 4 hours!Overall, this was one of the highlights of my trip, and was a great was to see a large section of the city, while learning about the local history and architecture. Great fun, and I highly recommend it!"

A great way to see and learn more about Budapest. Including our lesson, we were out for approx 3 hours. V good value. Thanks Tamas."

I actually didn't use Yellow Zebra for their primary business - rather, I found out they offer a very convenient printing service. I had a flight boarding pass on my computer from Ryanair, and, Ryanair being Ryanair, needed a way to print the pass before departing to the airport to avoid a draconian 70 euro fee. I simply went in and asked about printing. They then gave me the Wi-Fi username and password and an email address that I could then forward my electronic boarding pass onto for them to print it for me. The whole process took about 5 minutes from walking in the door to having my printed boarding pass in hand and it only cost (at time of writing) 60 HUF for 2 pages. So thanks to the friendly staff here!"

We are so glad we opted for the 3-hour tour. We had almost decided NOT to go with this company because they didn't offer a trip up to the Castle Hill, but the other company's availability didn't match ours so we went with Yellow Zebra. BARBI was so cute and nice and friendly, we really enjoyed her perspective on the city. She took us all over Budapest, almost in a whirlwind of touring---it was hard to take it all in during the short time we were with her. Luckily, she told us the opening hours of many of the places, and how to go back and enjoy them ourselves (museums, parks, baths, ruin pubs, even where the bus stops are to go over to Castle Hill!) Oh, did I mention that we were FREEZING and WET? No worries, the constant pop-up showers did not take away from the marvelous time we had on this tour, as Barbi provided us with ponchos and jokes to help us make it through the rain! This is a totally recommended tour!They do NOT provide a bottle of water on the tour (as our Prague & Dresden tours did), so bring your own!"

            "review": "Amazed at how fun and easy this was!. To fellow travellers considering the yellow zebra segway tour in Budapest---DO IT!! When I first saw this idea, it seemed kind of quirky, but potentially really fun, although I was a bit concerned about the fact that I had never used a Segway. Having now done this, I can honestly say that I can't think of a better way to see a city like Budapest. First, they gave us about a 15 minute lesson on how to use the device--very professional and carefully done. But honestly, it was hardly necessary. The device is astonishingly easy to operate--so effortless in fact, that it seemed only to take the mere thought to move forward or turn left, and the device would do it. It became so natural and easy within 10 minutes that I felt like I had be doing it for years. After doing it for three hours, I truly mourned having to get off and travel like other humans :) It's a perfect way of seeing the sights because (a) Budapest is mostly flat (we were on the Pest side), (b) this vehicle rides equally comfortably on sidewalks, over curbs, in streets--it's a little all terrain vehicle and is robust, (c) unlike a bike, it requires virtually no effort on your part, (c) you can travel up to 15 miles an hour and speed across town spanning distances to see far away sights that would cost a lot of taxi fare, or bicycle effort or tube navigation to see, (d) you can sightsee while riding, after about 10 minutes getting used to it, (e) people look at you with surprise and amusement and curiosity, which was kind of fun, (f) the method of travel between the sights becomes an end in itself because it is simply fun and effortless. In essence, the feeling of this device, after you get really comfortable--is that it is exactly like skiing through a city--it feels the same--you can solemn between people! Except that you are not limited by gravity. It is worth mentioning that the age range in our group spanned teenagers to people in their 60s--all of whom loved the experience. In fact for somebody with a bad foot or leg, it's pretty ideal--very liberating.  My only negative comments about this experience are as follows. First, although our tour guide was extremely nice, good natured, and fun--a very good host--the information he provided about the sights was a bit minimalist--enough to keep you interested, but the information was not really the highlight of the tour. But nobody on our tour felt that this mattered much, honestly. (if they wanted to make this even better, they would improve this element though). Second you should be mindful that the company does not carry insurance on its vehicles--and that if something happens to the vehicle, they will ask you to pay for it (this is in the contract you sign). I know this because I (like an idiot) tried to navigate between two narrow posts and ended up scratching the side of the segway. They charged me 25 euros for this, which seemed a bit excessive for a scratch. However, in their defense--these are expensive devices, and insurers won't insure them, and they definitely did not charge me as any kind of scam--in fact, they were profusely apologetic about having to do it. Despite this negative aspect, my overall rating of this company is superb--fun people, professional, good hosts, and responsible. I highly recommend it. It was easily one of the two best things we did during our 4 days in Budapest--exceptionally good."

The segway tour in Budapest was one of the highlights of our trip; not only were the segways incredibly fun, but the history along the tour was wonderful to learn.

The session began with some basic training as most in our group had not used a segway before, but not long after we were all whizzing around on them like we'd been doing it for as long as Barbie had! The tour began at the Opera house in Budapest, and during the two hour tour, we ventured throughout the city seeing the biggest sights like the Synagogue, the Elizabeth Bridge, the Chain Bridge, Parliament, St Stephen's Basilica and the beautiful Danube. If you have the opportunity to do the segway tour, we would thoroughly recommend you do; it is an unmissable activity and suitable for all ages; the segways add to the fun of the history along the tour and allow for a real quick and fun ride around the city if you do not have time to visit each individual attraction during your stay!"

Stopped at the major sites in Buda, plus several others - all with good explanations with both history and general interest. We also did a hop-on-hop-off tour; it visited many of the same sites, but drove by some that were on the segway tour. The explanations provided by Brigit and Christi were much better than the pre-recorded ones on the bus tour. The children wanted to cancel our other plans and go on another segway tour. I'm sure we'll go on another segway tour on a future trip - Yellow Zebra has set a high standard!"

What's great about this tour is that it takes you to sights that are a little far to walk from the main downtown area such as Heroes Square and the City Park. Other areas you see are St. Stephens, the Jewish district, Parliament among others. If you've never done a segway they provided adequate training. Barbi was a fantastic guide. After our great experience with this we decided to book their castle walking tour. This hour and a half tour provides the best views of Buda and the history of the castle district. Our guides name was Balazs and he too made great recommendations. Lastly, another guide named George helped us significantly in their office although never giving us a tour, he was still great.

Bernadete is local so her information about the city, history and hungarian culture was really valuable. She even offered to make our tour slightly longer than it's usual! Incredible! There is a short break in a nice cafe right at the foot of Parliament where you can have some complimentary cakes and drinks. Bikes are of very good quality, Budapest is a flat city and has really nice bike routes so it's easy to move around. Only the way to the castle is a little bit steep but it's almost insignificant part of the trip.There are so many positives to say about this tour...You do it very well, guys, so keep up a good job!"

But that's me just being fussy.Would highly recommend and looking to book another one in Prague! Excellent!!!!"

Our tour guide also made it very fun by including trivia in it and giving the winner a \"grand mystery prize\". We could design our own tour, plus nobody else showed up for our booked time and thus we could have a private tour! The only thing I didn't like was that at some point we were in the bike lane on the road, and a motorcycle came very close to me, thus I had to stop very quickly and almost collided with the tour guide, therefore I would recommend avoiding doing this if you can. Their office is also very pleasant, and they could call us a taxi to go home which was very convenient. Overall I am satisfied and would recommend this experience to others."

We decided to do a Segaway tour at 5 in the evening and called these guys and they were very prompt in organising one at such a short notice. Three of us had not ridden a Segway before, and the initial training given by our tour guide Tamas and his colleague had us riding the Segway like we had done it many time before. The tour was on busy populated pedestrian footpaths and some sections was on cycling lanes. Tamas was very informative and yet funny. He kept checking time and again on us novices. At the end of the tour we all wished to do more... But alas as somebody had said all good things must come to end."

Our tour guide - Bernadett - was brilliant, very knowledgeable, excellent English, and obviously very proud about Hungary and Budapest, and her enthusiasm made the time just fly by - thank you Bernadett !!

The drink stop was a good opportunity to chat with others in the group although it might have been better after our hill climb rather than just before!!

We have done several Segway Tours in other cities ( Berlin, Paris, etc) and this tour was wonderful. Budapest is a big, spread out city so we did this our first day to get a feel for the city and see some main attractions. We had a great time on our small tour which had 4 other people not including our guide. We did the extended tour which was absolutely worth it. Barbi was our tour guide and she did a satisfactory job. We prefer if the training is done for all guests simultaneously because it took almost an hour to do individually. Although we love history, the history she provided was slightly difficult to follow and very dry. It would have been nice to incorporate more captivating stories with some humor involved as was typical of other Segway Tours."

The bike tours begin at 11am and last for 3-4 hours - I lucked out and was the only one who signed up for the bike tour that day- so I had a private tour with my wonderful Hungarian guide Anita. The price of the tour is 6500 forints - roughly 32 US dollars. We hit the major sites of the city and rode our bikes at a leisurely pace. FYI you don't have to be \"in shape\" to go on this tour- most of the city is flat and there are many sites where you are stopping and learning about the history so you are never cycling for an extended period. One cultural aspect that I was pleasantly surprised by were the Hungarian drivers. They are so patient with cyclists and they never honk their horns- what a contrast to american drivers! Anita was a great guide - providing a rich history of the city and the country. Would recommend the tour in a heart beat!"

With neither my partner nor I having ever ridden a Segway before, there was an air of trepidation prior to the test drive. The first time you get on it you wonder how on earth you'll survive and when, with no more than a brief trip up and down the street, you are unleashed on an unwitting public you will wonder how on earth anyone else will survive this. However fear not, for the Segway is an amazing machine and it is amazing how quickly you pick it up (if a chimpanzee can ride one then you can, right?!). After 5 minutes we were nipping in and out of crowds, hitting the speed limiter with regularity and nigh on begging Laszlo to unleash the extra 15 km/ph held in reserve for when you are no longer deemed a novice. Our tour guides were Laszlo (apparently also a \"Luke\" when he studied in the UK) and Kinga. They made the tour fun and informative, with great insights into the history of Budapest and Hungary as a whole. The tour takes in all the major sights in central Pest, save for the Parliament buildings, which are viewed at a distance. This is by no means the cheapest thing you can do in Budapest. The trip itself is around 18,000 HUF (60 Euros) pp but one must also factor in the 15,000 Euros that you will inevitably spend when you commit to going home and immediately buying a Segway. Given that within the budget of your average city break the trip as a whole is pretty inexpensive, this tour is approximately equivalent to an espresso and a postcard from the Champs D'elysees, it represents great value money. Especially as this, in my humble opinion, is the best way and most enjoyable to see central Budapest."

All I can describe him as, is that he had a blue jacket on; think his name beings with an 'L'. He is so awesome; really makes you feel at ease on the segways. Me and my boyfriend researched the segway tours before we went and knew it was something we had to do. Think it cost around 40-50 pounds for over 2 hours riding the segway and half an hour training beforehand. My boyfriend took to it really quickly but I was not so great at first. The segway almost becomes an extention of your body; after an hour you feel and look like a pro!!!!We had already been on a couple of tours so we saw a few sights we'd already seen on the tour, but our tour guide gave us some great info that we hadnt heard before so that was great.He also showed us a few attractions we walked past earlier in the week and were interested in but didnt know what they were due to the language barrier so that was helpful!!There was only 5 of us on the segway tour altogether (including the guide) and we had a few races near Fashion Street and around St Stephens Basillica, and the guide took a vfew videos and photos of us on our phones. You get no end of attention; however some Irish tourists thought it'd be funny to try and hatch a plan to get it off me not knowing I was English and could understand what they were saying; that was perhaps the only downside to the experience!It was so much fun and gave us some fantastic memories! The tour guide never pushes you to go really fast and you have to follow all in a line because he'll only take you the routes and up kerbs etc. that are suitable for segways; so although its major fun you have to be safe too!!Something everyone should try!!!!"

The yellow zebra tour doesn't differ from that point of view. But from our perspective the detail level on some of the places visited was a bit too deep. We would rather have seen more places of interest and listened to more general information. We would also have preferred to have the coffee break in a typical Hungarian cafe rather than in a super-modern international bar. But to see Budapest by bike is great and the city is really beautiful!"

However, our guide tamas was informative, funny, and made quizzes of the information he told us so we were always engaged. The tour starts with a training session until everyone in the group is confident. I was extremely anxious about whether I could handle the segway, but after a few minutes I was able to let the segway take me everywhere. It's a great experience and is certainly better than walking.The route is simple, you see great sights and get a really well grounded feel of the country's history and also an insight to more cultural and political views in a non biased way too. Tamas was encouraging, supportive and entertaining. This is not the first tour I have done with them, and I have faith that any tour you do will be the same quality. Perfect for newcomers to the city, or a great new way to see a place you have lived in for years, get on a segway!"

I did a three-hour tour and was lucky enough to be the only one at that time, so had my own personal guide, Peter. Peter was excellent; he was very knowledgeable and pointed out many details I would not have noticed wandering around on my own. I had never been on a segway before but we had a practice session first and I soon found out it wasn't too difficult and was heaps of fun. I was glad we had three hours rather than the standard two; it gave us time to thoroughly explore the Pest side of the river without ever feeling rushed. The segways can't go everywhere you can go on a walking tour, but that didn't limit us; there were several times when we stopped and the guide looked after the segways while I went inside buildings or across uneven ground to take a closer look at the sights. We also took plenty of photos; the guide was willing to take as many snaps as I wanted. I also did a walking tour while in Budapest and while that was also interesting, this tour allowed me to cover so much more ground in a very short period of time. One nice touch was that the guide brought a book of historic photos with him, and showed me some of the places we saw at significant moments in their history. I would definitely do a tour with this company again. If you are going to try a segway tour, I recommend wearing comfy, warm clothing and shoes and bringing your camera."

We turned up on spec for a 2 hour tour of the city by Segway after seeing it advertised in the booklet that came with the Budapest cards that we bought at the airport on our arrival (which gave us a 30% discount off the price, so well worth having).As there was no-one else there at the time the tour was due to depart (9.30am on a Sunday in early October) we were treated to a private tour by Peter (who speaks perfect English) which was FANTASTIC. Really informative and great fun (I so wish Segways were legal to use on the road over here....). I can't recommend it highly enough - it really did make my holiday - absolutely wonderful. If you have them I would recommend you take gloves with you, even if it isn't that cold, as your hands can get a bit chilly on the Segway (as the weather was mild when we went I didn't take my gloves on holiday with me). I believe they have special mittens for use in the winter :-)"

Tamas greeted us in the office, he got us all set up with our helmets, and described where he was going to take us on his tour. After 30 minutes of hands on training, Tamas lead us down the streets of Budapest, pointing out all the interesting places that we came across. Tamas made the trip fun, he used his knowledge of the city to create an ongoing game to test our knowledge and to see if we were listening to him. The tour was a fantastic experience, and I hope that we will be able to tour with Tamas on our next visit."

If you're only in Budapest for a couple of days (as we were) then this is an excellent way to see some sights, get your bearings, do some exploring and learn some facts all in one. From the City Park and Heroes' Square to the Fisherman's Bastion, it was fantastic fun and informative too. And there's a cake stop in the middle! If you're nervous about cycling through the city, it's actually absolutely fine. There are a lot of cycle paths and Peter looks after you well. I couldn't recommend it enough - much nicer way to tour than on a stuffy bus and with somebody who is really passionate about their Hungarian history. Plus they have a tremendous bookshop at their headquarters to pass some time before or after the tour."

The hotel reception confirmed space on the tour, and I made it over by 11:00. The location is central (behind the Opera House). There were 11 of us on this English speaking tour, distributed evenly from USA, Canada, UK, and Australia. The bikes are in great condition and well maintained (helmets provided, but optional). Peter, our guide, was a blast! Over the 4 hours we covered 15-20 KM total, with relaxing riding (except the uphill to Buda Castle which added a bit of strenuous pedaling, and a very rapid descent) and frequent stops at the major attractions. We were able to cover major parts of the city, cross the river on the Chain Bridge, and see all of the sights (from the outside, no visiting the attractions on this trip) in a single ride. As this was my first time to Budapest, it was a delightful way to get acquainted with this wonderful city, and to make a short-list of the places to visit. Peter shared the history of each part of the city, highlighting the contributions of various Hungarians to the world. We stopped for a lemonade and dessert at a very nice outdoor restaurant (included with the trip price- also very nice and handy WCs there).As an FYI, the bike shop does have sunscreen (just ask, they have a large bottle for customers to use)."

One gal, who was a slow cyclist, was left completely behind and missed a turn. Then the guide didn't even go back to look for her, just waited for guests to call on cell or go back and search. So, poor marks for group safety. And group too large (about 13 or so) for one guide."

Our guide was the lovely Brigit, and as we were the only ones on the 6pm tour she gave us the option of the usual guided tour or to take us down to City Park - so the Park it was! Absolutely great fun, Brigit was lovely company and recommended a few things to us including a restaurant for that night (seperate review for Belvarosi Lugas) and a guide we had previously spoken to, Thomas, had recommended the zoo which was fantastic. It may seem a bit pricey but believe me you won't regret it - brilliant fun!"

We booked online this tour for the first day, we thought it might give an idea of what the city could be like and what we wanted to see better in the next days of our holiday, we weren\u2019t wrong. When you arrive you\u2019re given a nice KTM bicycle and you\u2019re told how to operate if you don\u2019t know how to. Guides are in english or hungarian, I find our guide Kinga, very easy to understand. The tour is very easy, mostly flat road apart from a small hill to the fisherman\u2019s bastion, nothing too challenging though and I didn\u2019t use a bicycle in 10 years. A break in the city centre it\u2019s included with something to eat and drink, we find it very nice. I strongly recommend this tour to anybody, infact it was one of my favourite things in Budapest."

The tour was comprehensive, but not overly so, so the children were happy the whole time. There was a break in the middle for some delicious strudel (r\u00e9tes) and drinks - which was much appreciated on a sunny, hot day. Our tour guide was thrown a curve ball, access to Castle Hill was closed due to a WWII bomb being discovered in the vicinity. She talked with all the participants of the tour with several alternative attractions to visit for the remainder of the tour. The company is professional, equipment is great and location is easy to find. We highly recommend Yellow Zebra :)"

In a matter of minutes we were zipping in and out of traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian - be aware of pedestrians as they are generally unaware, and often quite suicidal, but no injuries were encountered.Mat always ensured that we were within eyeshot and managing the Segways competently. Once satisfied that we were, in fact, in control, he switched off 'turtle' mode, allowing us greater speed and manoeuvrability.I booked this from Australia well in advance and think this is a must do for everyone.

Bike lanes in the city mean that now you can get around so easily and as there were no time limits for bike returns, your day is your own to explore.

Not only did we get to see a lot of the sites very quickly, our guide (Barbie) was extremely informative from a historical perspective and helping us understand what it is like to grow up in Hungary. I would consider myself a very experienced cyclist (biked over 5,000 miles) and I found this ride to be intense due to rush hour walkers, bikers, and cars. While we tried to stay in bike lanes, everywhere was crowded with some local bikers riding extremely fast though tight areas. We saw one local biker crash into a pedestrian at 15 mph or so (I'm sure some bones were broken). Barbie was a very safe guide, went at a very moderate pace (8-10mph), and made sure the group stayed together. FYI - these are hybrid bikes, not cruisers other bike tours throughout Europe use, which is good for the terrain, but adds to the fact that this ride is a little more intense than other bike tours you may find in Europe."

We know the regular tours include \"training:\" important, but a little boring (and sometimes amusing) if you know how to ride one already. So we spoke with our hotel concierge and she called Yellow Zebra and asked if we could do a private tour. We were pleased when they graciously obliged. We arrived at the appointed hour and met our guide, Peter, who put himself completely at our disposal... \"What would you like to see?\" was his first question. Couldn't have been a better way to start a tour. Peter is a knowledgeable and humorous guide and he made the tour so much fun.

The mechanics in Budapest checked everything over, and the equipment was great. There was one major flaw. Yellow Zebra had absolutely NO maps for the entire route from Budapest to Vienna. This turned out to be a huge deal as we got lost a few times, which slowed us down. More importantly, we ended up having to travel on high-speed roads with big trucks and lots of traffic. Fortunately, those stretches were brief, but they were very dangerous, and did not add any enjoyment to our trip. About halfway through we found 2 very good bicycling maps of the entire route. We discovered the first in the Sturovo Slovakia tourinform. It is a very detailed map of the route from Sturovo to Bratislava and was exactly what we needed. The second map, picked up at the Gyor Tourinform, was a complete map of the Danube bike trail from Vienna to Budapest and provided alternate routes through Hungary and Slovakia. Both of these maps should have been available for purchase when we picked up the bikes. Alternatively Yellow Zebra could have notified us where we could get them before we left the US. It would have saved a lot of headaches. If this happens to you, check out this website for the Vienna-Danube map: www.esterbauer.com There is no website provided for the Slovakia map, but try www.vku.sk, website or email vku@vku.sk. It was a great trip and I highly recommend it"

            "review": "Fun and interesting tour of the city. The Yellow Zebra bike tour of Budapest (booked online through Absolute Budapest Tours) was probably the best way to fill 3 and a half hours and get a feel for all that Budapest has to offer. I would recommend it as a way to begin your Budapest visit - you can then go back and visit the various attractions in your own time.One important thing - if you book online or have a voucher, you should print it out before arriving. They do have a computer and internet, so I was able to log on and print my email, but if you forget your email password or something else, it could be awkward.Our group was small (three people - me and a married couple who were in Budapest for a wedding), which was great as when we stopped it was easy to hear what Fanni (the tour guide) was saying - no craning over someone else's shoulder to see and hear. We made regular stops and in some places, Fanni looked after the bikes and gave us 10-15 minutes to wander. Fanni was very knowledgeable and had a good sense of humour so the experience was overall very enjoyable. I would advise that you should be comfortable on a bike in an urban setting and have at least a reasonable level of fitness, as the climb to the Buda castle would be quite difficult for anyone who is very unfit. You don't have to be superfit, but especially on a hot day like today, if you were very unfit I think you would struggle to get up the hill. Also, although Budapest is very bike-friendly, you have to keep your wits about you to adapt to the switches from main road to side road, to bike lane, to cycling on the pavement. It was easy enough for a small group of us to follow Fanni, but I can imagine in a big group, the person at the back might get left behind or be unsure of whether they have right of way.At the end of the tour, Fanni gave us some good recommendations for places to eat and drink and took into account what we said we were interested in (like pancakes!).The same company does bike tours of Prague and I wouldn't hesiitate to use them again (a good excuse to visit to Prague). Overall, I'd strongly recommend this as a fun way to get outdoors and see a lot of the city!"

Our guide good information about each stop and kept us entertained for four hours. It gave us a good grounding on what was where in Budapest, and where we should visit on the other days of our trip. The day we did the tour was the hottest day by far, which the guide took into account with frequent stops in the shade, and to refill bottles at free water fountains."

            "review": "In 2 minds about it. There was no getting away from the fact that it was a bargain price, the tour lasted for ages and we really did cover everything there was to see in the city center. Plus the group was small, just 4 of us. However our guide wasn't the most engaging, she knew a lot of things to say to us, but when the other couple asked questions, more often than not, she didn't know the answer, and sometimes struggled to understand what they were asking (translation problems perhaps). We were asked if we wanted to go up the hill and figured why not, but the temperature was pushing 40 degrees, and the day before we had been in London with a temperature of 17 degrees. That combined with the huge tour coaches puffing out fumes from their engines as they lowered their gears to get up the super steep hill was enough for me to have to pull over and take a breather, and some water. I think when going up the hill, the guide should be more aware of who their customers are, age, physical fitness and where they're from (i.e are they used to this heat/humidity) and plan a stop up the hill accordingly.However, all in all, it was a great way for us to orient our selves to Budapest and spot the places we wanted to go back and visit with more time to give to each attraction. I probably would recommend it, but if you think you might struggle getting up the hill - for whatever reason, don't assume the guide will be looking out for you... you must speak up before you begin to tackle it!"

My daughter and I recently visited Budapest for a short break and, having never been there before decided to join Fanni on bike tour of the city with Yellow Zebra . What a great way to see the sights and sounds of a lovely city. we joined a small group of three hung overed Aussie lads and three Americans two of which were mother and daughter.The bikes were new and excellent quality, and very comfortable. Fanni was an excellent tour guide and very informative. Pest is excellent for cycling with Buda a challenging but achievable climb, and the views are well worth the challenge.The Budapest traffic is very cycle friendly which made the experience that much more enjoyable. This was a great way to get your bearings and discover the city in your own time in the future.The cost was 4500 HUF, excellent value. Thanks !!"

I had more fun interacting with my fellow partners in the bike ride. There was some close moments here and there with traffic but otherwise it was fine. Took at break near the river and also near the park and it was all very perfect. Truth be told, my brother and I had more fun just interacting with our fellow travelers and talking about the sites. We were with a family from Texas and also another one from Florida so it was a nice American reunion."

Since it was 36 C that day, our tour guide asked if we were still up for the tour and we said yes, of course, she did not back down and the three of us toured the city.

The tour covers a lot of ground and many places that I was considering looking at anyway - now I know which bits I definitely want to revisit, and our guide gave us handy info about tours at those places and other parts of the city that we might want to visit. The ride up the hill to the castle was a bit steep, but if you're in reasonable health I don't see why you'd have any problems.Our guide was funny, knowledgeable, and was able to answer all our questions - and her English was excellent.

There are plenty of stops when the informative guide tells you all about the beautiful buildings and history. Our guide Fanny, was delightful and took everything at our pace. Be prepared for the heat however, pack plenty of sunscreen and water. There is one large hill on the second part of the tour up to the castle but the views are worth it as is the exhilarating ride down afterwards. Do this at the beginning of your visit as on the three hour tour you get to see all the places you will want to return to and our guide told us of all the passes and travel tickets we would need. If you aren't used to any exercise then take a bus tour or rent a Segway. It's very disappointing to read negative reviews on here which have more to do with the climate and fitness of the reviewer, than of this company."

Not reccomended for kids or people not comfortable on a bike.

He effortlessly socializes with the group as he walks you through the city and explains its history in a simple, fun and informative manner. The tour also includes a coffee break where Mat will introduce you to the finest Hungarian cakes! (You pay for the cake!) The tour finishes at the top of the hill near the castle, so if your planning on visiting the castle during your trip to Budapest, then this probably best done straight after the tour. One of the best walking tours I've been on, highly recommended!"

He speaks excellent English. We had an enjoyable 3 hour walk with a stop for coffee and cake. Nice morning in Budapest. The Hop on Hop Off Tour mentioned it and as it turned out Mat works for tips. It was a little difficult for us to determine what to give him. It would be nice if Ho Ho sponsored him and he wasn't dependent upon us. I hope he does well as he is very upbeat and fun to be with."

We were a group of five friends on our first visit to Budapest and therefore hungry to learn and explore the city. He explained us about the history, the people the culture. Matt is very friendly, helpful and easy going. And we got lots of additional insights and answers to different questions we had. If you go to Budapest and want to make the most of it, do not hesitate to book the tour with him. Thank you Matt, you rock!"

My group had people from Spain, Italy, and the US (me) and I was surprised that he spoke fluently to all of us.

Mat's knowledge of the city is excellent and his command of English is second to none.The tour lasts around 3 hours at a relaxed pace and includes time to go inside St Stephen's Basilica and for a coffee stop near the castle.Mat runs this tour on a tips-only basis ( i.e. he doesn't get paid by the bus company) and he were happy to tip him accordingly.Would recommend this tour is you're in Budapest for a few days."

Although it was quite a walk from the Opera House to the Buda Castle, the mix of historical information, trivia and insider anecdotes and well-timed stops combined to give visitors a great appreciation of Budapest, while getting some exercise And to Mat, yes, we tried the Langos for lunch, and we tried the Tur\u00f2 Rudi.

For a free tour, we didn't expect anything great but when we met our tour guide Mat, we knew he was different. He didn't just introduce himself but he tried to get to know us too. He explains each sight well in an interesting way (not boring), thus, making him a very effective teacher. The tour was a bit of a walk but I guess it's the best way to see everything in the area. Mat made us rest though by taking us to a cafe at the Fisherman's Bastion which was a good idea after a long walk. He even lent me his umbrella when he noticed me trying to shield myself from the sun with my phone. That was so thoughtful of him. Our group agreed that he's a very good tour guide and he would be a good example for other tour guides to follow. We are so lucky to have met a great guide like Mat."

There were only 4 of us in the tour (plus Matt), so it felt very personalized. 2 of us from Las Vegas, 2 from Spain. Spoke fluent English, very easy to understand. Though the 2 people from Spain spoke English, Matt speaks Spanish very fluently as well, so he made sure to explain things in Spanish if he felt what he was saying needed clarification. Very considerate. We found out about the walking tour as part of the hop on/hop off bus tour, and it was free, just tip him afterwards for his work. We met at the Opera House at around 10AM. We did the hop on/hop off bus the day before to get a basic idea of the city (rode both the red line and the yellow line of the \"big giraffe\" bus- both informative and gave us basic layout and what we thought we wanted to see on our own. BTW, the hop on/hop off bus was great as well and we had the use of it for 48 hours so we used it as our public transport as well during the 48 hours). Having Matt give us the walking tour was a GREAT addition. From the Opera House, we walked all the way to the Buda side. Stopped at St. Stephen's Cathedral and looked inside. Stopped at various statues and plaques along the way and he explained the importance of the people who were memorialized (Liszt, Ibl, Andrassy, etc). Matt even told us where to find the relic of St. Stephen inside the cathedral. Walked across the Chain Bridge. Walked to Fisherman's Bastion for view of the Parliament, then passing by Matthias Church. Had a coffee break at a nice pastry shop where we tried some Hungarian pastries that Matt recommended. He also talked about Hungarian food and recommended restaurants and what to eat. We walked through Old Town Buda until the tour ended just by the Buda Castle. Along the way, he talked about Hungarian history, food, culture, and answered questions that we had. He was very informative (especially for such a young guy). He was funny as well, very personable and definitely provided great info on the city. After the tour, we felt we saw everything we wanted to see at Buda side including the ones that we thought about going to from the day before, thus saving us time and effort. Would definitely recommend. I think even if you do not have a hop on/hop off ticket, since Matt does this privately (he owns his walking company), you can just show up in front of the Opera House at 10 AM and do this with him. He'll be holding a sign so easy to recognize. Again, IT'S FREE, so just tip him generously! If this is your first time in Budapest, it's a great way to familiarize yourself with the city and learn about Hungary. Be forewarned though that it is a walking tour and so be prepared to walk for about 3 hours. Probably about 2-3 miles at the minimum. Flat surface in Pest side, hills and stairs on Buda side. THIS TOUR IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FIRST TIMERS TO BUDAPEST."

It's not the Paris of the East, Paris needs to try hard to keep up with Budapest!The Hungarian people are just awesome and so is the cuisine!Number 2: We just got to know about the conquer Budapest tour by a coincidence, and we were really happy about it afterwards. Our guide Matyas knew a lot of cool historical facts about the squares, buildings and the whole city. Still it didn't get boring with an information overload. When he saw that we were really interested and he didn't have any other plans he even extended the standard tour and showed us some more cool places. That was for sure one of our favourites in Budapest."

My sister and I didn't do too much research before choosing this walking tour, but after seeing an ad in a brochure we had no expectations and decided to go for this onet. It ended up being the best decision we made in Budapest! She had made a list of things to see/do in Budapest, and by the end of the 3 hours many of these items had been crossed out. Our tour guide (Max) was so knowledgable- born and brought up in Budapest (he even showed us his high school!) and the mini \"quizzes\" kept everyone in the tour group engaged. We honestly didn't want the tour to end! Thank you Max :D"

The tour was free, with a tip expected for good service. Luckily we got Mat (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Szira), the handsome young owner of \"Conquer Budapest,\" as our guide. He was thoroughly knowledgeable about the history and culture of Hungary which we learned as we passed by points of interest (he even quizzed us on important facts he had emphasized). The tour was leisurely with lots of time for questions, and we were surprised at the end of the tour that so much time had gone by. But Mat's greatest asset was his excellent English. We've experienced some guides in the past who spoke such heavily accented English it was impossible to understand them. Believe me, we appreciate how tough it is to speak a second (or third) language, but it's such a shame to miss out on much of the information being given because we couldn't recognize the words the guide was trying to say. That's why it was such a pleasure to listen to Mat. If you're going to Budapest, contact Mat for a tour."

Mathis as guide was very good as he shared stories about why he knows Budapest so well and paid attention to detail by engaging with his audience and speaking to them in their own language. He speak French, Italian, English and of course hungarian, which also added to the appeal of choosing Him. 2.5 hours did not seem like a drag and went so fast we were shocked when said it was the end!

It was a rather chilly day so my friend and I were the only two that showed up that day. Matthias was extremely knowledgable and made learning about the city fun and intriguing without even trying. It felt more like we were walking around town with a friend who knew all the answers to whatever question you wanted to ask.I would recommend this tour to anyone wanting a locals perspective on the city. Thanks again Matthias."

This free, tip-based tour took me through the first barrier of exploration in Budapest, with great information from several fields like architecture, history, politics and more. The guide was a local from Budapest, with great english skills. The tour takes you to both sides of the Danube, covering several of the \"must-see\" when visiting the city. Highly recommended as a first approach, since you'll get a great impression and a good feeling of what to do next. Don't be afraid to ask questions, since the guide is very friendly and been doing this tour for years, mostly for fun as far as I could tell. Definitely 5/5!"

The tour was full of fun questions, jokes and facts and I would really recommend the tour to people of all ages and families. Matt was even kind enough to translate his tour to Spanish for a few guests who had trouble with English. He went above and beyond and you can tell he's passionate about what he does.

Our guide matyis was very enthusiastic and informative and spoke English very well (apart from him saying bowl as bowel which was funny as we had to explain the difference).A very interactive tour as he would make sure we were paying attention by asking us questions about what we had just seen - if in doubt say 1896! Despite being a walking tour it wasn't overly exhausting as there was plenty of stops and easily done without getting out of breath! Learnt so much more doing this than doing the HOHO tour and even though it's based on tips the guide isn't too pushy to ask for huge amounts. Very highly recommended"

Peter and Paul were our drivers, and they were full of interesting history, facts, and stories; they knew Budapest! They were also extremely flexible: if we wanted to stop somewhere, or take a peek at something else, it was no problem. Peter and Paul were quite generous with their time, and both were extremely kind. It was fun riding around in the tuk tuks; we were able to cover a lot of ground quickly, something you could never do on a walking tour. We had just the best time, and we learned a lot, too. Thank you so much Peter, Paul, and Budapest TukTuk!!"

We chose the tour ending in goulash as it left us near the fisherman's bastion with plenty to look at before a gradual walk down the hill to pick up public transport. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the goulash but that was a personal preference, the restaurant was smart and helpful."

We had a great driver - Daniel - which took us all over. Gave us great details on all the main sites of Budapest and was more than happy to let us enjoy a bit of extra time at the sites and sounds of Budapest.

She briefed the driver (Mikkey) excellently and he helped keep it all a surprise.We was picked up from a river cruise and taken to Gellert Hills. I requested a bunch of flowers and champagne for after the proposal. Once I had proposed, Mikkey (the driver) came up and gave me the flowers in such a sly way I felt like James Bond. We then returned to the TukTuk where a bottle of champagne was popped and we continued the tour whilst sipping on the bubbly.Bori was a star in all of this. She was excellent with her communication and any query I had was promptly answered. The night went perfectly and a huge part of this must go to Bori for sharing over 30 emails with me really planned everything to the tee.Mikkey the driver was also fantastic and was briefed really well and kept the whole thing a surprise.

We did suggest where we wanted to go (we have been here before), so our Driver, Miki, was accommodating but not knowledgable of questions we had.

Our driver Paul arrived on time at our hotel and brought us on the most amazing tour of Budapest. Paul was a really great driver and we felt safe and relaxed throughout the trip. His knowledge of the city and its history was fantastic. Our trip included a Danube boat trip and Paul brought us to the boat and sorted us out with the tickets. A truly magical day. Thank you so much Paul."

We call them when they were late and they said the driver was 5 min away. 30 minutes into it we called again and the dispatch didn't answer. We then we're on our way to plan B.... poorly handled to say the least and ended up costing us precious sightseeing time. If you use this service, go to their meetpoint, not a hotel pickup. Hopefully you'll have better luck."

This was a great way to see the city and we were able to go to places that the tour buses could not reach. Peter, a university student, was very knowledgeable and obviously proud of his city. We were picked up and dropped off from our hotel which was a bonus for me as I walk with some difficulty. Thank you Peter. You made our visit to your beautiful city even more memorable."

The benefit of riding on it is that you can go through the paths that those big buses by other companies that cannot go through. It is also amazing that the tuktuk driver really know a lot about the city, and they can introduce to you about all the stories behind the roads/architectures, good places to go on your own, recommendations on places for eating, you can even stop and take the pic with the beautiful background while sitting on the tuktuk. Another benefit is that, whenever you have questions, you can ask the tuktuk driver immediately, and I am sure they will be able to answer you, I guess with the interactions with the driver, it more or less made me feel like i have a private tourist guide."

He told us about the history of the monument he took us to and we were amazed to get to know so many details in so short time with him. The tour lasted an hour but we were able to visit the Parliament, the main railway station, the Heros Square, the Opera House and some other attractions on this amazing means of transport. I would definitely recommend to choose Budapest TukTuk to discover the city, since the tour is custom-made and you can choose where to go and what to visit. The driver is at your disposal and you will end up in a bar enjoying a refreshing lemonade (incl. in the price) at the end of the tour. Definitely worth the price (19.00\u20ac). Thank you Thomas!"

From the backseat of this bike like taxi with the top down we watched our driver take us to key places and listen to him explaining the background history. He was courteous and friendly with good local knowledge. We were able to cover the castle area on the hill, the parliament building, the downtown squares, the monuments and many points of interest in a couple of hours. It would have been even better if they could provide earphones to allow us to hear the guide clear full above the traffic noise. "

Since it is a motor vehicle it cannot enter the pedestrian areas but we went towards the Parliament and then down to the Danube. Our driver Miki offered to cross the chain bridge which was an excellent idea. We all enyoed this weird mode of transportation and enjoyed being a tourist in our own city for a few minutes."

We were born and live in Budapest, but we really enjoyed to see the city as tourists.We started our trip after working on a weekday afternoon. It was enjoyable and comfortable for 3 of us just sit in the car and look around while our driver, Berci answered all the questions precisely. He was nice and patient when we stopped to take photos and he helped us a lot. We finished our 'exploration' at 360 Bar drinking cocktails in the sunset...Many thanks for the TukTuk team for the precious time and for all the great memories!:)"

This is the best way to see a lot in a little time. We know Budapest quite well and were shown new places we had not been to before. Our tour was in the early evening. Not so hot and less traffic. Ended up on Gellert hill at sunset with impressive views of the city as it came to life at night. Thoroughly recommended."

I was in Budapest with my wife for three days and we want to see all the major attractions, monuments, and popular sights but with a more personalized approach. We didn't want to do the hop on hop off buses because they can get hot with so many people and they are often too slow. I found Budapest Tuk Tuk on tripadvisor and noticed how personal and accommodating they were, read all the wonderful reviews, and immediately made up my mind to book a tour with them. They responded promptly and picked us up at 9am, the exact time they told us they would be at our apartment. They come directly to your address and pick you up, so convenient! Our tour guide/driver, Bertalan, was so gracious and welcoming. He told us tons of facts and historical information about the city and its landmarks and monuments. Bert was extremely funny and a great tour guide. The Tuk Tuk rickshaw had an open back which allowed us to drive through the city with amazing unobstructed views. Due to its small size we were also able to navigate and maneuver through smaller streets and other great locations that were off limits to the big tour busses. In just about 2 and a half hours my wife and I had seen all the big highlights of Budapest, in comfort and style I might add, and we still had the rest of the afternoon to decide which of the places we had visited we wanted to return to in order to spend more time there. I highly recommend this company and want to personally thank Bertalan for making my wife and I feel like rock stars in Budapest. You get way more than your money's worth with this tour and company and I hope to return one day with friends and relatives and take them on a Budapest Tuk Tuk tour. If you are still reading this, book your tour with Budapest Tuk Tuk now, you won't regret it."

Single American girl wanted to see city of Budapest - I traveled 20 hrs arriving by overnight train & needed a tour that could show me everything in a day without waiting with large tour bus groups! As I'm continuing on the next day by train ... Tuk Tuk was perfect! My driver, Thomas, knew the city & sites incredibly well! I wasn't sure everything I wanted to see - so left most of it up to him. Great day & fun to go around town by Tuk Tuk. Yes, it was getting hot out, but the covered top & breeze while driving was really ok. Very personalized tour! I did tour 11-2pm, then he dropped me off at Market Hall for some tourist shopping then nice stroll along Danube. Plenty of time to even take a river cruise & stop at the 'ruins' pub street later on to cool off :-). Thanks Thomas!"

As there were 7 of us, I emailed ahead to ask if this would be a problem because it appeared that the tuk tuks only accommodated two people. They responded promptly and advised that although they do accomodate 2, that we could have 3 in one of them. We found this to be ok and didnt feel squashed at all. The trip was brilliant, such fun as we were in convoy. The drivers explained and pointed out different sights and were knowledgeable about their city. We asked if we could stop off for a drink in a bar and they waited patiently for us whilst we did this. This obviously knocked some time off our tour so we didnt see the castle area but that was our choice and we still felt we had seen loads. At the end of the tour, the driver gives you a voucher to validate for a free boat trip on the Danube. This trip was just amazing. We all agreed that this tour was great value for money, especially when taking into account the hour long boat trip, again which is narrated on audio with a free drink too! I would highly recommend the Tuk Tuk trip as part of your experience in Budapest!"

They send a driver/guide to your hotel in the TukTuk, a small 3-wheel golf cart-like vehicle but with more power and speed. For about $55 US you get a 2-1/2 hour spin to some major sites while visiting nice neighborhoods in the Buda side and at the City Park. It's private, just you and the guide, no crowds or jostling on and off buses. Our guide was Gabor, who not only spoke good English but gave us the benefit of local history and geographic insights that made Budapest all the more interesting. He dropped us at the Marina since the price included a one hour boat tour which was also excellent and provided great views of both shorelines while being well narrated by a tape. This is a great overview which we followed up by going back later in the day and next day to visit a few sites we wanted to see more of (using a cool scooter we rented from Scooter Budapest, but that's another review)."

The Concierge on our Viking River boat said the best way for us as having some mobility issues was to see Budapest via the Tuk Tuk. The Viking representative in our hotel also told us the same thing so she made a reservation for us. Paul arrived promptly at the set time and off we went with the top down. It was not long until the weather threatened so he put the top up. There were blankets in the \"buggy\" but unfortunately they were wet from the rain we experienced. He offered to put the sides on to keep the rain out but we said we were OK (my wife used her umbrella at her side to keep the rain off). I was just fine. Paul drove us all around the city on both sides of the Danube and took us places no other hired transportation would be able to take us.Paul would turn and face us and give us all the information we could (and could not) handle about Budapest. He spoke perfect English and was so knowledgeable. Our tour was priced at 46E each but he took US dollars which was great. Paul is the best!!!"

Tuk Tuk is not just for Bangkok anymore!!!!! Adam, you darling young man!!! I pause to sing your praises!!!! This is THE WAY TO GO!!!!!! Adam picked us up promptly at 11:00 a.m. Annnnnnd We werrrrrre OFF!!!!! TukTuking round Pest, and later, over the river, into Buda! Every beautiful thing, every interesting thing, Adam introduced us to them all! With more time in the city, we could go back and extend time at any of these places, but we won't have time!!! Even with such a short time, we are delighted to say we have truly SEEN Budapest!. The people of Hungary have engaged in vigorous restoration of beautiful buildings and places that were destroyed during World War II, and neglected under the Soviet control. Never have we seen buildings so beautiful in design - - from various eras of architecture -- and so lovingly maintained. Bright clean, scrubbed or freshly painted - - not sure - - but everything with pride and determination, kept in excellent condition and order. A true gem of a city!! And Tuk Tuk Tours takes that pride and determination on up another notch or two, showing you the entire city - - parks, buildings,monuments, lovely tree-lined streets, all with Adam's gentle, intelligent, knowledgeable comments on history and happenings. What a perfect way to invest our time here!!! This little electric pony cart edges in and out of places where any larger vehicle could not beGIN to go!! As we zipped along, we observed bus-loads of people following guides in groups a block long, to see various and whatever. Lots of staring at us, with clear looks on their faces, wondering how we got THAT!!! I tried really HARD to smile without smug!!!! Such a happy trip!!! We're LOVIN' it!!! Our driver/guide Adam was ALL ABOUT what would be interesting and pleasing to us, helping us love Budapest and Hungary. Well, Adam, THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE IT!!!!! Thank you for our wonderful, wonderful trip, in your wonderful Tuk Tuk!!!! Thank you for all your caring, considerate, sweet help with my stiff knees and ankles!!! Your thoughtful kindness will forever be a bright star in our European tour!!!!! TripAdvisor People!!!! If you are planning a trip to Budapest, we urge you to include Tuk Tuk Tours as a part of your plan. If you are NOT planning a trip to Budapest, we urge you to do so!! immediately!!! :~)"

Adam arrived exactly on time at our central Budapest hotel. After brief introductions and presenting him with our pre-arranged voucher we were on our way.Adam gave us a choice of two possible routes to Margaret Island and after suggesting we would like to enjoy his expertise and allowed him to choose the route. Travelling towards the riverfront route Adam asked if we were at all interested in learning more of the history of the area. We were happy we indicated we were as he was full of little kid-bits of information as to the naming of particular features and structures as well as the sometime good fortune / sometime misfortune of the area being in a desirable location and having desired agricultural and economic features that resulted in many armies battling over the region from the time of the Romans onward.Our tour through Margaret Island was delightful under the shade of many large trees. Adam was extremely receptive to our questions and readily able and willing to quickly search out the english name for a number of tree varieties we had questioned him about. He also gave us time to wander slowly through the region surrounding the musical fountain and were able to obtain a number of beautiful pictures of the impressive trees and gardens surrounding the fascinating fountain. On our way back from the island we travelled the river route on the Buda side of the river and took a side trip through some of the castle district and up to Fisherman's Bastion where we had another opportunity to wander and have a look at the spectacular views of the city from there. Having completed that excursion, Adam asked us for our desired drop-off location and as we had other plans for the afternoon he returned us expeditiously to our hotel where we were picked up.All-in-all, this is probably the best experience we have had in our two separate trips to Budapest; due mainly to the pleasant, polite, and knowledgeable nature and attitude of our Guide. Currently I am unable to walk great distances was I am currently awaiting joint replacement. This tour provided a wonderful opportunity to experience a number of features even with my condition - greatly appreciated!Thank you Adam!"

I appreciated his politeness and care, and he willing to answer all my questions, often adding an extra insight. It was certainly a great way to travel around the very busy tourist spots, especially in Buda where there were dozens of big buses with hundreds of people, and we were able to move at a pace that suited us both.

Had no idea he was new to the team- was a great and courteous driver and answered our questions about life and culture and drove us around in the sunshine. I booked the tour for myself and my parents, both of whom are in their late 60s, and I'm in my early 30s. While I could explore Budapest from dawn to sunset, they don't always have the energy to walk all day and explore big cities by foot, even though they have the interest. The tuktuk seemed like a great way to see it all and it absolutely was. You don't feel stuck and above/separated from everything like in a tour bus and you cover SO much terrain and see so many sights. It's a very personal experience where you can ask questions and engage, stop and wander and experience the city. It really is the ideal way to travel and I know I will be booking this kind of transportation in any city I travel where it is available. The transportation itself is fantastic and Gabor really made the trip that much more enjoyable :) I am so glad we booked this tour!"

We got tuk tuk voucher as part of hotel package and I was doubting how it will look like, especially that we have one son 13 and another one 2.5 years old. But the ride was amazing!! We all enjoyed the tour so much! Guys were so kind and great, stopping on interesting places, telling stories about those places... My little son fell asleep, we covered him with blanket and it was so nice riding in tuk tuk with him asleep on my lap Thanx for a great day in Budapest! Hope you will have a lot of work in the seasons that come!"

I surprised my fianc\u00e9 ... well, by that time she was already my wife ... with a tuktuk trip from the church in M\u00e1riabesny\u00f6 to Veresegyh\u00e1z. It was fantastic, I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend this!There are two reasons for that: One: My wife loved me for it. It was a wonderful trip. Second: The Budapest Tuktuk Team was great! They gave us an absolutely decent offer, communications with Vivien were fantastic and they actually drove out to G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u00f6, which is a bit of a ride and which must have been fun for the driver.Some more details: The tuktuk was there on time, which I didn't know, but my best man took care of the preparation. Because right after church we were greeted by a tuktuk with many red balloons and a smug driver. We hopped on and he had a playlist of french chansons prepared, which was great for the occasion. We took a wonderful tour and had a great time, enjoying the first minutes of being married.We then reached the \u00e9tterem and while my wife and I had our first champagne, the driver stayed another hour or so, so that the children amongst our guests (yes, there were some very old children) could have a chance to take a little tour in the tuktuk.So thanks again, the tuktuk was an important part of our wedding!!!"

The only thing I can say was a mistake was leaving this for my last day instead of it being my first day activity. Our driver Robert was just amazing..I truly can't say enough about him. He met us at our hotel and was even early. We took the We'll Show You Everything tour- about 2.5-3hrs. Robert asked us what we had already seen and he modified the tour as to not take us to places we had already seen. Robert was a wealth of knowledge and an obvious historian and was always willing and able to answer any questions we had. He took us to a special park and explained the history of Buda and Pest. A very special and personal touch. This is such a more personal tour than the hop on hop off bus tours- and very much worth the money spent. I couldn't recommend this enough to anyone visiting the beautiful city of Budapest. We covered in hours what it would have taken days to do on our own- and was shown lesser known areas of the city that many tourists don't see. From start to finish, Robert treated us with respect and kindness and was really engaging in conversation- He LOVES what he does and it shows. Thank you Robert and TukTuk for making our trip to Budapest so very wonderful and exciting. At this time they have 7 Tuk Tuks and many packages available to suit most needs. (tour was in English)"

I found out about it coincidentally, when a Tuktuk stopped in front of my hotel, and a very happy tourist stepped out of it. I instantly thought this it is a brilliant idea to do a tour this way, so I booked one for the following day. Balazs, the driver, picked me up and off we went. 5pm was the perfect time, the light of the sun coloured the horizon and sights looked even more fabulous. The tour (\"Budapest pro\") was set to 150 minutes, just enough to get to see the best spots. Balazs was very helpful and entertaining, and you could feel he enjoyed his job. I would recommend this tour to any Budapest 1st timer, and do it on the 1st day right away. It will help to get a feeling for the city and help you find the best spot to return to on your own."

We really enjoyed the experience of being driven through the city amongst the traffic as it made us feel apart of it, it also helped us to get an awareness of our location and where other places were that we wanted to visit.Once we drove over the bridge into the Castle Hill area we were able to stop at the Citadel for 15 minutes to get out and look around before Alex took us to Fisherman's Bastion etc, Alex told us loads of interesting facts about the beautiful architecture and we finished at the Piknik Pavillion where our wine and lunch awaited us. It was the perfect tour 90 minutes long which then gave us plenty of time after lunch to visit the Royal Palace and to look round the whole area before catching the Funicular train back down to the bridge.Can not recommend this trip enough we loved it !!"

Having a personal, knowledgeable guide, an open air ride, and access to places a bus can't get to is a winning formula, and for a price that's affordable.

Gregory was polite, interesting and informative - plus, he knew Budapest and all of its \"secret sites\" adding just the right amount of historic detail to make it interesting without info overload. We took the tour on our 2nd day in Budapest and thought we had seen nearly all of the highlights, but Gregory helped us discover even more. A splendid trip with an exceptional guide and his English was beautiful. Thank you Gregory Pastor for a great Budapest experience.Ed and Pat - Palatine, IL USA"

I went over & spoke one of the guys who explained it was a new venture that they had started only 2 weeks earlier. Don't worry these aren't your tuk-tuks with hundreds of personalized lights you see in other counties. They have seat belts, side doors & a cover if necessary.Rather than using the hop-on hop-off bus this seemed a much more personal way of seeing the city & really wasn't expensive (47 euros per tuk-tuk for 1\u00bd hours + a free cocktail in the 360 Bar & they even picked us up from our hotel) The beauty of this attraction is that because the tuk-tuks are classified as motorbikes they can get closer to places the buses can't. If you wanted them to stop you can at any time which you certainly couldn't do on a bus. The two drivers were very friendly, knowledgeable with great grasp of our language, (& many others) which helps.If you want to see the city in a more friendly, personal & fun way use these guys."

Our group of 7 decided to include 3 days in Budapest on the front end of our Danube River Cruise, and to make all of the arrangements on our own. As part of this, we felt it would be important to have a local guide show us and tell us the important and interesting aspects of Budapest. After reading numerous reviews on Trip Advisor, I felt that Travel Guide Hungary would be the best company. I was attracted to her company for 2 reasons: it appeared that they focused on smaller groups and Orsolya seemed to reply to virtually all reviews submitted to Trip Advisor. To me, that was a sign of someone who monitors and cares about her business. She responded to all of my e-mails promptly and we arranged for a 5 hour tour of Budapest. She was also totally flexible to gear the tour to any particular interests that we had.She met us at our hotel promptly at 9:00 AM. She led us, a group of \u201cseniors\u201d, throughout both Pest and Buda, at a brisk but manageable pace, using public transportation where advantageous. That actually added to the experience, Her knowledge of the history of Hungary and Budapest, in particular, was very impressive. Her style was a combination of serious, historical information and humorous commentary which fit perfectly with our group. Since it was a warm day, she was also sensitive to our needs for hydration and rest occasional stops.All in all, everyone in our group was extremely pleased with the tour that Orsolya. Her personality was a perfect fit with our group. Not just a litany of historical information (we are not big history buffs), but important history along with anecdotal commentary. We could not have asked for more. Great tour! Thank you, Orsolya!!"

He was gentle, patient and very knowledgeable and gave us all the info we wanted without the constant list of facts that we were bombarded with from guides from the ship. The driver was calm and was able to stop off and meet us so that my father would not have far to walk. Between them they were able to adapt the tour to our needs with no fuss. They then drove us to the airport where we arrived at the time we had arranged. There is no question that Orsolya runs a very efficient business and we would use and recommend.

We booked driving tours and it was totally worth it! Very easy to cover lots of ground and we felt like it was a great value. Our city tour included lots (and lots!) of sights, but we also had the chance to shop and eat along the way. It was the perfect pace and while we covered a lot we never felt rushed.Our castle/countryside tour was a great way to see other parts of Hungary. Sumeg castle recently got rid of their motorized transport to the top so it was kind of a steep climb but it was worth it for the view (and the chimney cake). We also had lunch at a quaint restaurant at a local vineyard which offered great food and an equally great view.I would not hesitate to recommend Orsolya and her team and we look forward to another visit someday!"

She was very personable, knowledgeable and we felt very comfortable with her. Unfortunately some of our travel friends had to fly home from Vienna and never made it to Budapest so it was just the two of us but we still had an eventful evening with Orsi. We were interested in walking around the city at night, having some wine, seeing the Danube at night on a boat ride and experiencing a ruin bar and we accomplished it all. It was a long tour, we left at 7pm and got back to our hotel at 11:30pm with lots of walking but we felt that we saw a good snapshot of Budapest nightlife. On Orsi's suggestion we booked a private boat tour for 1 hour, in hindsight, 30 minutes would have been plenty to see the sights because the last 30 minutes were spent speeding up and down the river plus it was quite an expensive ride for us because it was only two people paying because we were missing some friends. But it was a minor detail and we did have a very fun time. The bonus was Orsi telling us about her favourite restaurant Kispiac Bisztro and we went the following evening and had a fabulous experience. I would highly recommend Orsi."

We spent the entire day doing a walking tour with Orsi and enjoyed every minute. She was knowledgeable, easy going and completely flexible to ensure that the day focused on the things that we were interested in.We particularly enjoyed the little known facts and tidbits of information that brought so many of the places we visited to life. She showed us many \"off the beaten path\" places (like a small family run chocolate shop in a corner of the town with few tourists). She was quick to offer suggestions for restaurants and even set us up with a private boat tour one evening that was really special.Budapest is a big city with plenty to do and see. Orsi made sure we got the most of our visit and she did so in a fun and engaging way. I highly recommend her to anyone visiting Budapest."

            "review": "Fantastic Day Tour with Attila. We were visiting Vienna recently and wanted to take a day trip to Budapest. Since we had never been before and had little time, we booked a 5 hour long private driven tour with Attila of Travel Guide Hungary. Of the 10 days we spent in Central Europe, Attila's tour was one of the most informative and fun. He wove history and stories into a seamless day of travelling throughout both Buda and Pest. We particularly appreciated the fact that we were shown not only the \"must see\" sights, but signs that were equally culturally-significant that the typical tour might not otherwise see. It started with him meeting us at the train station and returning us there in time for our departure back to Vienna. By the end of our tour, we really felt we had \"seen\" this great city (as much as one can in 5 hours, of course). Also, if there is any concern about a language barrier if you are an English speaker (like us), that is not an issue. Attila's command of the English language is excellent. In short, if you are considering a guide in Budapest, we do not think you could go wrong with Attila. We highly recommend Travel Guide Hungary and, in particular, Attila. Thanks again for a great day!"

Splitting the tour simplified the process for us tremendously, as Kamauf collected us from the train station on the first day and took us back for our return on the next. On our first day Dora took us to several of the main attractions on both side of the river before giving us some suggestions to do on our own that evening and next morning. The following afternoon she collected us from our hotel and altered the itinerary to fit our tastes. This is exactly what we wanted from a private tour.

Like a fine wine our impressions of OROSYLA has morphed into one of the best experiences my husband and I ever had. So why wait? Well.. life, but then my sister and her husband were planning visiting Budapest June 2016, and they needed guidance, and yes.. I suggested they contact OROSYLA. I believe they shall be seeing her within the next week or so. Before continuing I want to note that neither my husband nor I fawn over people. We don't make-nice. We are quiet, honest reviewers. And we have travelled quite a bit. So we are not goo-goo over our first European adventure.My husband and two mid-thirty's children and I had Orosyla for 2 - 1/2 day tours, one of the city and one outside in the countryside. The third morning my husband and I toured with her once more in the city for another 1/2 day prior to sailing on our river cruise. We still recall her cheerful smile, and honest evaluation of the historical Budapest vs Budapest today. She was professional, yet humorous and quite flexible. Yes, she was knowledgeable re the history, but also about the shops, and culture et al. Even took us to the New York coffee caf\u00e9 on our third day. Now that was an exquisite spot , very old world. Look out Starbucks. Our driver was pleasant and another member of our \"troupe.\" What impressed us was that Orosyla and the driver took care to drop us off and pick us up at convenient locations re the tours - not just any old spot as some larger tour busses do.We celebrated my husband's birthday while in Budapest and Orosyla recommended two restaurants - BOCK - and another with Gypsy music whose name escapes me. We really had great fun at the BOCK; the gypsy music was haunting but the experience at BOCK was better for us. She also recommended a \"ruin bar\" another important cultural experience. Would we return to Budapest... In a heart beat if we could! Would we ask for Orosyla again? A thousand times over. Sounds like she is a member of my family... no, but I wish she were. We would be proud to call her our own. Don't mean to sound creepy, but she is / was the perfect hostess."

The guide listened to interests and facilitated a very informative trip. I'm a history buff - she answered all of my questions very well and within context. Some of our party had mobility issues, the tour was then tailored to minimize steps - although we still walked a bit but not too much. The van was very comfortable, drinking water was provided and at one point one of our party became a little affected by low blood sugar - the guide walked them into a nearby shop to help purchase a snack (managed in Hungarian and even paid for the snack).

Though most of the Zsolnay tiled fountains and sculptures had been boarded up for winter, there was still plenty to see. The architecture of the town looks very light and airy. The Mosque of pasha Qasim the Victorious is beautiful inside and is a must visit. The Pecs Cathedral is also very interesting, with a flat, wooden roof.We stopped by the Zsolnay museum in the town and the Zsolnay factory quarter where we saw the artisans making the beautiful vases that grace the museum. And the factory shop was extremely affordable if you want to bring back a unique souvenir. Another good stop is the 1861 Glove Manufactory store where you can get extremely well-made handmade leather gloves. Now every time I wear my gloves, I remember Pecs.Trying to catch all the daytime possible, we had lunch very late in Villany, the local wine region. The Bock wine cellar and restaurant was very nice and gave us a wine tasting along with our meal.At the end of the tour, Orsolya and Mikhail dropped us off at the Szechenyi Baths for a soak. My mother still speaks very fondly of our trip and how much she loved Pecs. I hope we can come back in the summer when we can enjoy even more of the town's sights in Orsolya's company."

Judit was our guide and because of her, we now have a better understanding of the Hungarian Culture, History and its people. My husband communicated the sites we were most interested in and Judit planned our days out perfectly. We toured all the major political/historical sites and she educated us at each monument and told us of the significance of each event and the impact it had on the people of Hungry. Although we did not get to the wine country (this time, we will be back) Judit made sure we had a wine tasting tour, set up at a local wine retailer and educated us on which wines came from which regions and what made them so special. We were really impressed with the Hungarian wines, as we never thought we would find any better wines than in Napa Valley.We toured the coffee houses, dessert shops and local markets (which were my husbands favorites). Our last night, Judit took us to the Ruin bars in the Jewish Ghetto district. We have never seen such varieties of beer, wine and food options in a few square miles, it was amazing! We all agreed that our trip would never have been as good if we had not had Judit as our guide. She is knowledgeable, flexible, intelligent and accommodating. She even went out of her way to make sure we had lunch reservations at a Michelin restaurant we were interested in trying. I can not recommend this group of wonderful people enough.

Orsi is very helpful and is able to confirm my booking one day before the tour.Choosing Orsi to be my guide proves to be a right decision. Thru the private tour which last for 8 hours, i visited all the key sites of Budapest and each location was well explained. Orsi also shared many local secrets as well as answering all my questions on Budapest past and present political and living situations etc.Travelling with Orsi is a great way to travel and i feel like i have seen and know a lot about Budapest in 1 day. As Orsi is able to customised the tour based on your interest. I highly recommend her tour if you are short of time and does not want to waste your visit to the beautiful Budapest city."

As this was our 1st trip to Hungary, we contacted Orsi a couple of weeks in advance to arrange 3 days of what we described as a relaxing tour of Budapest and the surrounding area. We couldn't be more pleased with the itinerary she put together. She met us at the airport and showed us her city by car which gave us the perfect cursory knowledge for the rest of our trip. The next day she planned a walking tour of the Budapest with an unforgettable start at the Grand Market. Her pace was perfect and her ability to adjust to our requests on the fly was astonishing. The third day was a trip along the Danube to the Danube Bend and the hills that run along side. The picturesque views coupled with the intimacy that you can only see when accompanied by locals was truly amazing. The final stop at Szentendre was the perfect ending to three days that seemed to flyby. We could never have experienced Hungary the way we did without Orsi and her driver Mihah's intimate knowledge of their country which made the experience totally unforgettable! Nagyon sz\u00e9pen k\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m."

Orsalya was an excellent guide, knowledgeable and enthusiastic, always smiling and very accommodating. She knew the border between being informative and being too talkative so we had a great time- she gave us the right amount of information and also gave us space to be silent and enjoy the landscape. It was a nice change from guides who talk too much and you feel obligated to reply. She really is good at her job and clearly enjoys it. Always such a pleasure to meet someone like that. She chose a great place for lunch and had small surprises on the trip for us like a surprise view point and stopping to look at interesting buildings on the way. We were really disappointed to be able to see nothing at Visegrad due to very heavy fog that day but the company and overall tour was so lovely that we never felt bad. The day was well spaced and we never felt rushed. Orsalya would not mind while we looked into a shop or something and was very patient -even recommending which souvenirs to pick up. Mikah was also very nice and a great conversationalist as well. I would highly recommend Orsalya for your time in Budapest, its worth the expense and most certainly we had a very very good time with her and Mikah."

For example, we visited vineyards of different sizes, from the small charming historical village of Palkonya to the well known Tokaj wine region.

Some of our friends did the Lake Balaton tour with Juli and they were equally delighted.Orsolya was forthcoming with suggestions of restaurants, sights and shopping.

We walked the whole tour and this was the best way to take in this amazing city, there is so much to experience & learnt every turn. Orsolya was very knowledgable and her passion for Budapest clearly shows. It was lovely that we also had lunch with Orsolya at the end of our tour at a place she recommended in the Castle District, it was a great way to end the tour.

A couple weeks before arriving in Hungary last May I found Travel Guide Hungary online because I was looking for a more unique tour in Hungary instead of the free tour offered by Viking River Cruise. Since it was close to the date of the cruise, I wasn't sure if there would be any available tours. Luckily we heard back quickly from Orsolya who was able to provide us a guide for the day we were in Budapest. Our guide for the day was Juli who met us at our ship. Juli then walked us to the van, which was parked just right by the ship where we met our driver for the day, Emi (I'm sorry for the mispelling on the driver's name). The van was comfortable with enough room for 3 more people in the backseat. Emi had also brought a cooler of drinks for us as well for the day. We then headed out to our first stop.On our way to our first stop of the day, Juli would have Emi slow down along the way through Budapest so we could see some of the sites from the van. She would provide explanations about the sites, like the former Roman ruins in Budapest. Even though the van was honked at a few times by other drivers for slowly passing by the sites, Emi gave us enough opportunity to see them from the van. This was really nice to see some of the sites of Budapest from the van by going slowly. We then headed into the countryside.We stopped at a popular hiking spot for views of the Danube Bend, Esztergom, Visegrad, and Szentendre. At Esztergom we visited the Roman Catholic Church of Hungary. Before visiting the Church though we drove across the Danube to get pictures of the Church from Slovakia. Afterwards we headed to Visegrad, but never actually stopped in the town. We were supposed to have lunch here, but the restaurant was booked fully when Juli called. Instead we headed to Szentendre for lunch. After lunch Juli guided us through the town and we walked through two local Churches. After spending some more time in Szentendre we headed back to our ship in Budapest. Overall the tour was fantastic and a great way to see the Hungarian countryside. I would definitely go with Travel Guide Hungary again if I am ever in Hungary again. The driver and guide were both excellent and very helpful, probably one of the better private tours I have taken in a long time."

Not only did we have a terrific tour of Budapest with Zsofie as our tour guide, but we also had a lot of fun. She met us in the morning precisely at the agreed upon time in our hotel lobby. Zsofie helped to bring the history of Budapest alive and was an absolute delight. We were thrilled by her pleasant demeanor and her amazing knowledge. We especially enjoyed how she used her iPad to illustrate in more depth what we were seeing and what she was telling us. We appreciated her insight into the end of the communist era and the transition that Budapest has made in her lifetime. She took excellent care of us as she shepherded us around Budapest for the entire day. Zsofie helped us to see nearly everything on our extensive wish list and timed the tour perfectly - getting us where we needed to be exactly when we needed to be there. She was even patient as we worked out the final \"high finances\" of dividing the tour and tips among three couples and figuring out how to use the last of our Euros supplemented by US dollars. We had a wonderful time in Budapest with a tour that ran like clock work thanks to our reservation through Travel Guide Hungary. We would recommend the company to anyone planning to visit Budapest in the future and would encourage them to ask for Zsofie."

The total cost of the tour ended up being $400 for the tour, $42 for lunch, another $20 or so in entrance fees, and I gave a $40 tip to be split between the driver and the guide.

Each morning Orsolya and our driver, Miha, picked us up at our hotel and whisked us through the streets, and traffic, of Budapest. This was great because it was quite hot while we were there. The car was air-conditioned and we got water from out hotel. At the Great Market Hall we tried different types of Hungarian sausages made with paprika and ate Langos for lunch. Orsolya gave us helpful advice for souvenir and paprika shopping. On the Pest side we tried Hungarian strudel. After our tour we felt comfortable enough to navigate Budapest on our own and see some of the lesser sites. And we went back to the Great Market Hall to do all our shopping on the last day.We highly recommend Travel Guide Hungary. Having a guided tour greatly enhances your travel experience - you will better understand what you are seeing and the spirit of the people. And you won't find a better guide in Budapest than Orsolya and the team at Travel Guide Hungary.Be sure to book your tours well in advance so you get the tours and dates you prefer for your trip."

Our tour for my family of four, lead by Juli was one of the best ever. Her knowledge, enthusiasm and energy was incredible. We had a Mercedes Van with driver and private guide (Juli) for eight hours for less than $400. They arrived promptly at the agreed upon time, picking us up and then dropping us off at our hotel. We absorbed a great deal of historical knowledge in a day with Juli. If you are traveling to Budepest, I highly recommend this company and Juli."

Our tours with Adam painted the complete picture of this dynamic place. Not only did we get a comprehensive history but also the contemporary vibe that is happening now. We were there this summer when the migration started from Syria, the prime minister of Slovenia visited and the Romanian soccer fans filled the streets - all in the same day!! and Adam explained how Budapest and its culture is positioned for all that and even more. I highly recommend Adam and Travel Guide Hungary."

We went to the shoes on the Danube, saw the Parliament, visited the Opera House and learned so much about Budapest's history from her. We had a wonderful lunch at the New York Cafe and loved hearing more stories during lunch. We visited the marketplace and she was so helpful....guiding us to the least expensive booth for PAPRIKA. We LOVED our day with her!!! The next morning we met Adam for a tour of the Jewish Ghetto and a visit to the oldest synagogue in the world....he was \"filled with information\" and we were all \"glued\" to his explanations of what we were seeing. We crossed over to the Buda side and he continued to amaze us with stories and history of the two cities. Once again, George was our driver and he was excellent as well.

The first day we spent with Judit, doing essentially a food tour but with lots of local knowledge and sights around the central district incorporated. We all really enjoyed the morning, as Judit was a very passionate foodie and by sharing her attitudes and thoughts as well as fabulous authentic food we felt we learnt a great deal about modern, young Hungarians. The kids especially enjoyed the food parts of the tour, unsurprisingly, which probably made the food part of the 2 day experience more interesting for them than the sight seeing part the next day, especially as it was incredibly hot on both days and eating/ drinking, indoors gave them somewhere to eat their legs and refill the fuel tank! Thank you Judit very much. Orsolya was also excellent and knowledgeable as a guide and we certainly saw and learnt heaps in a relatively short space of time which was fantastic. I'm not sure if Orsolya was as used to guiding young kids as Judit ( a teacher) and maybe we should have spoken up a bit more but we found the sightseeing walking tour pretty tiring for the kids with not many opportunities to seek respite from the heat. We certainly appreciated taking the metro with her and perhaps would suggest that even though walking is the best way to see everything, using occasional buses would also help keep little and old legs fresher for longer in the heat. Overall we all really appreciated Orsi's knowledge and happy approach to the day and found her both very personable and also efficient way of leading and seeing lots in her gorgeous city. Thank you both for your kindness in showing us around. Orsolya was also"

The beauty of booking a private tour is that you can tailor it to your preferences so I won't list what we did.

We were told it would be one of the best meals we would have in Hungary and it was. I have never had goose that was so tender and juicy. Orsolya herself is a great guide, perfect English, very knowledgable and patient with all of our quirky and diverse questions. We would highly recommend her if you looking for a relaxing way to get out of Budapest and see some of the countryside."

There were four of us, two couples from U.S. Melinda was truly outstanding. She possesses all the prerequisite skills; English language, knowledge of culture and history, outgoing and friendly personality and a very strong storytelling ability. We saw many sights that day but it went past quickly. Having a car with a driver was an extra bonus. This allowed us to move quickly from one site to another without delays and without time used to walk back to the Mercedes van. The driver was always able to drop us a the door and pick us up at the door. The price was less than $100 pp for the day"

Our stops included tha quaint town of Veszprem, the ruin castle of Nagyvazsony, the castle of S\u00fcmeg, lunch in Badacsonytomaj, famous for the great wines and the amazing view over the lake Balaton, and finally a stop in Tihany, home of the Paprika House.

The organisation was done by e-mail and Orsolya who arranged our tour was very responsive and helpful. Dora, our guide on the day, has a lovely, relaxed manner and is very easy to talk to. She is from Budapest and is extremely knowledgeable about her home city. We found the tour both informative and fun and we liked that Dora invited us to choose between options on the itinerary. She also gave us some good suggestions of other sights to visit and a scenic route back to our hotel from where the tour ended at Fisherman\u2019s Bastion.All in all, we would be very happy to recommend Travel Guide Hungary and Dora to our friends and TripAdvisor readers."

With Orsi and Eszter, we visited Danube Bend, Castle Hills,Benedictine church, lake Balaton,Visegrad Citadel, Herend porcelain factory, Buda Castle, Jewish quarter,Szentendre town, Szechenyi Baths, Ruin Pubs, etc. Even took an evening private boat ride along Danube watching the parliament and places by night, watching cultural folk shows..enjoy Hungarian food like Chicken paprika, Hungarian Goulash and many other local recipes. Everything we experienced with her were wonderful and fabulous..We highly recommend anyone visiting Budapest-Hungary to have her as your guide...personally we wish to welcome her and her friend as our family guest if she would travel to Thailand.

A lovely and intelligent young woman with broad experience and great personality. She has a subtle sense of humor and separates fact from legend while giving you a tremendous history lesson. Together we covered much of the charming city of Budapest and left us wanting to come back----and see Orsy of course. Her restaurant recommendations worked out really well and we are grateful for the wine bar she suggested--wonderful Hungarian wine selection.She is doing wine tours which we will try next! Spend your first day with Orsy and then decide what to do next--she will help you!"

Despite residual jet lag, we quickly warmed to Orsi's vibrant personality. She took us to the covered market, a shop specializing in the delicacies of Lake Baloton, a chocolate store for a tasting, one of the oldest caf\u00e9s in Budapest for a cappuccino and a rest, a butcher shop which serves lunch (unfortunately we were too late and had snacked enough along the way anyway), and a wine bar for a wine tasting. Those were places we visited, and enjoyed, but what made the day special was Orsi herself. She patiently answered questions, adjusted well to the pace of our slowest group member, and always told us what she planned next to make sure that was also what we wanted to do. She spent more than a full day with us and at the end, she booked a table for us at a very small bistro near the U.S. Embassy that featured the pork knuckle dinner my wife was craving. The thing about touring with Orsi is that you start the day making the acquaintance of a stranger but end the day regrettably saying farewell to a friend whom you hope to see again very soon. Thanks so much, Orsi. Until next time,Dennis, Trudy, Margaret, and Alexandra"

Orsi is amazing and will show you places in Budapest you won't see on other tours. The day of our tour it was raining much of the day but it was an incredible day and didn't deter Orsi from giving us an amazing day. She took us to places we would have never found on our own like a bustling farmers/craft food market with a young, urban vibe in an old and hidden building. It was well worth it to be able to just stop and ask Orsi about something we saw and that resulting in her taking us somewhere unexpected. The day prior we looked for hours trying to find a bookstore and coffee house on the Andrassy and Orsi knew it well and we shared a wonderful coffee with her just chatting. The value you get from this company is well worth it, you can't get this experience with a large tour group. We loved our day with Orsi and look forward to returning for more exploring with this great company!"

On our recent visit to Budapest (November 2014), my mom, husband, sister and I booked a half-day private walking tour with Orsolya from Travel Guide Hungary. We couldn't have been more pleased with our tour. We were spending several days in Budapest before boarding a Viking River Cruise, and we wanted to see some sights that were off the beaten track and wouldn't be included in the standard tour we would get with Viking. Orsolya was able to tailor our route accordingly, and we feel like we saw things that we otherwise would never have even noticed. She was even able to take us inside the Ervin Szabo Library, which was stunning. During the course of our tour, she also suggested places we could visit on our own later in they day, and all of her suggestions ended up being spot on. I highly recommend taking a tour with Orsolya. Our only regret is that we didn't have more time in Budapest, as we would have loved to take one of her tours out into the countryside. Budapest was by far our favorite of all the places we visited along the Danube!"

Kudos to Viking for a good general overview tour of Budapest but we felt we wanted to really experience Budapest. Anita with Hungary-Private Tours made our visit so much more memorable. She was timely, professional and really went the extra mile to make sure our group really experienced Budapest! We took the full 8 hour Budapest Explorer tour. She was so nice to accomodate us with splitting the tour into two 4 hour tours over two days. We were afraid an extended 8 hour tour might be a little too taxing for us. She took us to so many special places that we would never have found by ourselves and definitely not in an 8 hour time period. She took us to the market and ordered many things for us to sample authentic hungarian foods, became our personal shopping assistant, schooled us in Jewish history and walked with us as we visited ruin bars and visited historic bath houses. For a close up and personal tour don't hesitate to spend a little extra and make memories that will last a life time!"

We had several days in Budapest before a river cruise and decided to take one day to see what the countryside outside the city was like. There were 5 of us and we contacted Orsi about a private tour. She answered promptly and confirmed our tour. Since there were 5 of us, the cost per person was very reasonable. She was unable to do the tour but suggested another of her guides, Juliana. Juliana met us at our hotel with a van and driver and we spent a glorious day exploring the Danube Bend. When our whole cruise was over, everyone agreed that our day with Juliana was the highlight of our trip. Why?Juliana gradually (and painlessly!) taught us a huge history lesson over the day that gave us a context and understanding for the country of Hungary and its people. On our way out of the city we passed Roman era ruins under and around modern freeways and next to Communist Era apartment blocks. We heard about events and then found ourselves standing where they occurred. We stood in a municipal park overlooking the spectacular Danube Bend and understood why this part of Europe was so attractive to invaders. (Later in the week, it was fun to sail by the same spot on our cruise and point out where we had been.) We were willing to climb the 400+ stairs to the top of the largest cathedral in Hungary in Esztergom and look out at Slovakia and travel to it across the river to Slovakia, giving thanks for the open borders of the European Union. We had lunch in a lovely local restaurant outside the ruins of a medieval castle in Visegrad, with Juliana giving us guidance on Hungarian cuisine. Finally, we walked through the artists colony in Szentendre and found local craftspeople and a charming village. Although this sounds like a lot of travel, it did not seem that way since Juliana had us organized but at the same time she asked what we were interested in and adjusted accordingly. For example since we wanted to climb the cathedral stairs, we spent more time there than at other stops. Overall, we would do a bit of driving, then stop, do some walking and then have time to relax. We felt that we had a full but relaxing day when we got back to our hotel that afternoon. We also were able to travel the countryside with a native, who answered all our questions and observations and translated the language so we could focus on learning and enjoying. At the end of the day, Juliana gave us recommendations about what else to see in the city and good restaurants. We thank her for her advice to get a tour of Parliament - it was not what we would have thought to do but we were lucky to get tickets and have that experience!Although we had good tours on our cruise, by necessity, they were with more people, with less chance to adjust if something interested you. We all felt that our time with Juliana gave us a more personal and memorable experience of Hungary. If your group has a day in Budapest, I would highly recommend a private tour with Juliana and TravelGuideHungary."

She was flexible to our interests and even worked with us to track down the apartment my parents lived in almost 50 years ago! The only minor hitch was that our Jewish tour was a bit limited because the synagogues were closed to tourists due to the Sukkot holiday period but Anita compensated in other areas. Private tours are a relatively pricey way to go but in this case it was worth every penny."

She replied with extremely flexible options and very reasonable prices that met our needs. On the evening tour Orsi found out we had only a short time in Budapest before meeting her. She quickly modified the following days tour to include a quick trip in town before the bend tour. She was very considerate and flexible to assure we had a great experience. The van and driver rented for the bend tour was comfortable and well sized for our group.We were on a river cruise and she was able to accommodate the boats schedule and change of ports. Orsi was a wealth of knowledge and showed us many parts of the area we would have never seen without her. It was a great addition to our trip and I found myself missing the insight she provided when we were on the rest of our trip.

We loved talking with her about the original settlement of this area, the Huns, Magyars, Romans, and so on. In fact, Dora was well-informed and interested in a great variety of topics, which made for a very engaging time with her. We walked in some lovely parks, visited a huge historic bathhouse, and saw beautiful Danube vistas everywhere. A highlight for me was visiting the Cave Church, once a monastery, tucked away on a hillside. We entered to hear singing from deep within--a mass was being held--and that was a sort of magic. Dora also offered suggestions for lovely restaurants as well as other places we might like to visit. It is a testimony to Dora's skills that she was able to keep us entertained and and energized on our day of arrival after a very long overnight flight! We had a perfect time. Five stars for Dora!"

Our first was a half day walking tour of Budapest, where we saw many sights that got us acquainted with the city and its rich history. We were able to fit in Matthias Church, St. Stephen's Basilica, Buda Castle, Heroes' Square, the Parliament Building, a ride down the funicular, and much, much more. Eszter really knows the history of her homeland and her love and pride in it shows through. She was absolutely delightful and I came home wanting to read and learn more about Budapest's past. She is also very well acquainted with the transportation systems and made it \"look\" easy. If we had more time there maybe I could have figured it out as well!Our second tour with Eszter was a full day trip outside of Budapest to Esztergom, Szentendre and Visegrad on the Danube Bend. Breathtaking views! Eszter treated us to a surprise (which I won't spoil) that made my day! I loved each stop - the Basilica in Esztergom; lunch overlooking the Danube River with a view of the Citadel in Visegrad and shopping in the lovely town of Szentendre. I could have spent another week travelling around with Eszter seeing and hearing more about her amazing city and countryside."

She met us at our hotel on time and we began our tour by first walking through some notable sections of Budapest. They included visiting Liszt Ferenc Square followed by walking through the Jewish section. We made our way to the Danube where we took a river cruise that passed the Parliament building. The cruise was absolutely wonderful as it was in the evening and the Parliament was lit up as well as the bridges that we passed. The Parliament at night is absolutely breathtaking as is Budapest as a whole. During the cruise, Orsolya provided commentary and interesting facts. She is very easy going and quite bubbly. After the cruise we visited the ruin bar, Szimpla, where we all had some beer. It is a fun, funky atmosphere and the kids loved it. On our way back to the hotel Orsolya recommended we stop at one of the street vendors where we purchased delicious hot dogs and a couple of drinks. If I go back to Budapest, I would not hesitate to seek her out again. Orsi, thanks for a great evening"

My wife and I hired their guide Zsofi for a half-day morning walking tour of Pest, and a half-day chauffeured tour of the Buda (hilly) side in the afternoon. Zsofi met us at our hotel near the Opera House and we discussed what we wanted to see and we took off. Learned a tremendous amount about Hungary and Budapest, and learned about the huge transformations they have gone through in the last hundred years or so (Empire, Democracy, Nazi state, Communism, and finally the modern Democracy they enjoy today. Zsofi is a very personable guide with perfect English language skills. In the afternoon when it started to get quite hot out, we were picked up by a nicely air-conditioned modern car and driver. Zsofi did a superior job and was just what we needed. Our Budapest experience would have been much less enjoyable without her. Highly recommended."

We were greeted by Eszter in the morning along with the driver George. Eszter was very cheerful and took us for the 5 hr communist walking tour. Part of the trip was in a minivan since the memento park is a bit outside the city. Our first stop was at the Gellert Hill. Eszter had specially kept it a secret to surprise us and she successfully managed in it. The views from the citadel were simply amazing. After capturing several pictures we drove to the memento park. Eszter explained the pre and post communist history of Hungary while walking through the park. Our last stop was the House of Terror museum. The only part of the museum that sends chills down the spine is the basement where the prisoners used to be tortured. The first and second floor are simple displays of videos from the Nazi and Soviet occupations. I must say I was a bit disappointed in the House of Terror as I was expecting something different. Overall it was a good tour. 5 stars for the guiding skills of Eszter!"

On the first day, they picked us up at the cruise ship and took us to our hotel to drop off our luggage. We then took a full day excursion to the Danube Bend sites. It was a very relaxing trip and very informative in a beautiful area. After visiting Visegrad we had lunch at a lovely restaurant on the side of the mountain with great views of the Danube. We particularly enjoyed the stroll through Szentendre. On the second day we asked Orsolya to take us to all the places we would not visit on the standard cruise ship tour which we had taken the previous day. We did a morning walking tour on the Pest side. We particularly enjoyed our private tour of the Opera House. (Orsolya was a guide at the Opera House for a year before starting her own company.) We strolled through the city visiting many out the way places, also visited the beautiful New York coffee house and had lunch at a sidewalk cafe. In the afternoon, Imre picked us up and we visited Gellert Hill, the Gellert Baths, city market, etc, etc. Orsolya is also very knowledgeable of Hungarian wines and had some excellent recommendations for our dinner that evening. Maybe the next time we visit we will go on a Hungarian wineries tour with her.Orsolya is a delight to be with. She is extremely proud of her city and has an in depth knowledge of the history and art of Budapest. We enjoyed her anecdotes of the various places we visited. She has a degree in cultural anthropology which gives a great insight on the people and culture of a fascinating country. \"K\u00f6zi,\" Orsolya! Our thanks for two enjoyable days."

Sitting in the Opera and listening to her telling little stories about it was just fascinating! We then stopped by at a really beautiful hidden coffee house and the charming Liszt Ferenc Square before heading to the grand Heroes Square and the incredible Szechenyi Bath! For lunch place, she suggested New York Cafe which is called the Most Beautiful Cafe in the World! The cafe was stunning and the food was wonderful as well. We really liked it. In the afternoon, we did the Castle Hill which was enormous with the National Gallery, Fisherman's Bastion, the Royal Palace, church, and cobblestoned streets. And before she took us back to our hotel, she drove us up to the Gellert Hill where the entire city with her beautiful Chain Bridge, the Parliament, the Castle Hill, and the Danube unfold before us!

A group of 4 couples completed a Danube River cruise in Budapest and I was responsible for booking a driving tour one day and a half day walking tour the next. Orsolya (Orsi) was a complete delight to us and made our time in Budapest an incredible stay! She is very well educated and informative, personable and energetic- she made our trip to Budapest! On the first day she and a driver took us to sights we had not seen yet from the River Cruise tour the day before. She was very flexible to change the planned tour given what we had seen- and took us to Jewish Great Synagogue, the Szechenyi Baths, the Palace at their City Park, a special coffee break at the New York Coffee House, then a private tour of the Opera House (she is a licensed tour guide for the Opera), lunch at a neat caf\u00e9 and then to Gellert Hill to see Lady Liberty. She gave great advice for where to eat that night and the following night. All 8 of us loved her. On the second day, four of us did a walking tour with her- there is so much to see in Budapest and we never would have taken in these sights without her. From a special walk along the river to show us the bronze depiction of beginning to end of the Danube River and each of the original Roman settlements with excavations of the ruins in Budapest visible -- to a really neat area with bars with old (the real \"retro stuff) furniture and fun gadgets called \"ruin pubs.\" I would highly recommend Orsi to any traveler wanting a private tour in Budapest!!"

We started with breakfast so we could explain to her what sights we would be seeing the next day with the included city tour from AMA Waterways, our river cruise company. Orsolya already had Eszter very well briefed as Orsolya and I had e-mailed several times prior to our departure. According to my travel companion's fitness device we walked six miles that day. Not only did we learn so much history from Eszter but she put it into the very personal context of her ancestors. In hindsight I wished that we had asked her to jump on the metro now and then because it was not necessary to actually WALK everything! We were charged $195 for all four of us for more than six hours. We considered it money well spent."

Orsolya was very responsive and prior to arrival we agreed to do two tours. One full day and another evening walking tour of the city. For the full day tour, we had Andrea as our guide. She took us over the main sites in Buda and Pest in a car and then in the afternoon we walked through the streets seeing most of the sites. Andrea is an excellent guide and explained the sights very eloquently. She starts with the importance of the site, the historical relevance and add many amusing facts about each attraction. She is very friendly and knowledgeable about the city and its history. She covered most of the important sights, including the Jewish quarter, Opera house, market hall, royal palace and change of guards, baths, and other major landmarks of the city. She took us to the Market hall and introduced us to Hungarian cuisine and an afternoon coffee break at an elegant book shop cafe in the middle of the city!For the second part of our tour, we met Orsolya and she took us through the heart of the city and the evening life in the city. We covered mostly the Pest side of the city, but took a wonderful boat ride with well lit beautiful sights on either side of the river. Orsolya explained the details of this amazing city with passion and took us the more unique aspects of the city including the innovative ruin bar made up of discarded furniture. We were able to enjoy most parts of the city including the Jewish quarter, market areas, shopping areas, and other important sights. We were all pleasantly surprised over Orsolya's knowledge, passion and patience with introducing her city to us. The one difference with this tour company and many others we have used all over Europe is that they take you through every minor details of the city and explain their part of history with pride and passion. It is really touching and at the same time extremely informative.There is a personal touch to this tour, which I would highly recommend to anyone who is visiting Budapest. They are very responsive, polite, professional and I admire them for continuing to perform high quality work, which obviously require long days of hard work. We are really indebted to both Orsolya and Andrea for making our visit an unforgettable one and we are looking forward to another trip to Hungarian countryside and guess who will our guides be?"

Our family (husband and two children ages 4 and 5) took a walking tour of the Jewish Quarter and museum. We visited the largest functioning synagogue in Europe and several of the smaller area synogogues. Orsolya was very pleasant, knowledgeable, and patient (with our tired children). We made our way through the streets, alleys and hidden walkways where the locals eat, drink and hang out. She also guided us to a restaurant for lunch where she helped us to try Hungarian cuisine. We continued our walk through Pest and ended up alongside the Danube. We ended our tour for the day, so we could recover. The following day, my parents joined us, and Orsolya contracted a driver who was very professional and courteous, as well as careful. We started our day at the Opera House with a private tour by Orsolya. She shared the legends and royal secrets of the Opera House with us with enthusiasm and flare. We continued to walk and drive through the city. She even took us to a public bath house to show us local Hungarian customs. We then went to drink thermal water like the locals. We stopped for lunch where she helped us order traditional Hungarian food again. We then made our way to the Buda side where we drove up to the Liberty monument and visited fisherman's bastion; she took us through the Matias church. Orsolya is very knowledgeable about European and Hungarian history, both modern and classic. We had a great time learning about the people, the art, the wine and the city. We finished back on the Pest side with a walk through the Grand Market. We even bought Hungarian paprika! Orsolya and her driver then drove us to our cruise boat, where we were boarding a river cruise that evening. It was a great two days in Budapest and we would recommend Orsolya again without hesitation.Thanks again Orsolya!Adriana & Rich, and two little girls"

She (and her fantastic Driver Micha - or Michael for the language challenged) covered all the well-known things to see with a deep knowledge of history, cultural, and politics. She combined vignettes of culture and character, and her personal experiences... and also gave us an up close, more insiders view of special places not otherwise covered in the guidebooks. Her easy going manner and excellent presentation was delightful for all ages. The time went by too quickly and I look forward to returning to Budapest and seeing them both again!While I will select the recommended length of visit as 3 hours or more (Budapest deserves it!) - Orsolya can accommodate whatever time constraints you have. She managed our tour exactly to the time we had available with great care and efficiency without us ever feeling hurried or rushed in any way!"

We covered a lot of the highlights of the city, including Andrassy Ave, Hero Square and City Park. Brigi was very knowledgeable and pleasant, and we enjoyed our time together. We then spent 1-1/2 days exploring the city with Orsolya. We had such a good time. Orsolya was very flexible and adjusted the itinerary often when she better understood what we wanted to experience in Budapest. Besides the customary sites, Orsolya took us to awesome cafes and a wonderful local Hungarian restaurant, that we never would have found on our own.She saved the day, when we realized we left our camera in the taxi at the Great Market Hall. Orsolya went tearing down the street to catch up with the cab and rescued our camera. We were so grateful since there were 3 days of touring photos on it!This was our first time using a private tour guide and we really enjoyed the experience."

I'm embarassed to say how ignorant I was about much of Hungary's recent history despite being a history and political science major in university, but I now feel much more educated. I'm so glad we decided to take a private tour with her. It was absolutely worth every cent, and even though we took a tour exploring the communist history of Budapest/Hungary I'm sure that every tour she offers would be just as good. She even gave us several suggestions for other sites to see, and places to eat and marked them on our map. All of her suggestions were spot on.

She met us at our hotel in central Pest and we proceeded leisurely (we're not young) on foot for a mile or so, as she explained every sight along the way. Then she called a taxi and we crossed the Danube to the Buda side and proceeded up to Castle Hill, working our way up the river to Fisherman's Bastion, where she took us to a touristy but very good restaurant with an imposing view of the city (see photo). We had a light lunch, and I got to sample an excellent (but inexpensive) Hungarian wine. We took the funicular back down the hill and crossed the bridge to Pest where we spent the rest of the day wandering from place to place. What was unique is that we went wherever we wished, at our own pace, with expert guidance on what to see, and it was interpreted by a very talented historian who made it exceptionally interesting. If we needed a cab, she called one. If we needed a tram, she knew which one and where to get the tickets. We ended the day at the opera house, where she had previously worked and was able to take us on a special insider's tour. The best part of all this was Orsolya herself. She is an enthusiastic, personable, and completely professional guide. What did it cost? Not nearly it was worth."

She is intelligent, very pleasant, quite knowledgable about local history, culture, and geography. We took two local tours with her and enjoyed them both. You can design whatever tour type you prefer and hire her for a half or whole day at a reasonable price."

Based on Trip Advisor reviews, we booked both an airport transfer and a half-day city tour with Travel Guide Hungary. Orsolya\u2019s firm proved deserving of every kind word written about it and her attentive service made our time in Budapest a highlight of our trip.Our airport transfer was in a spotless, well air conditioned mini-van. Our driver was pleasant, professional and an interesting conversationalist. After a long flight it was such a treat and we were extremely pleased that he was the driver for our city tour the next day.We wanted as broad a view of Budapest as we could achieve with our tight schedule and the driving tour was a great choice. Orsolya set our itinerary based on a discussion of our interests and what our cruise tour had covered and we received insightful commentary on a variety of Budapest highlights. Orsolya expertly incorporated mini walking tours into our schedule and continued her entertaining and informative narrative as we shuttled between points of interest. Our driver always found convenient and safe drop-off and pick-up spots and this greatly enhanced the experience.Orsolya is a delightful, knowledgeable and flexible tour guide who made outstanding restaurant suggestions when asked. We give her our highest recommendation and our only regret is that we did not book a full day tour. Budapest is a gem and Orsolya makes it sparkle."

She is knowledgeable, accommodating, and willing to modify each itinerary to the interests and needs of the client. And, she is wiling to do this on the spur of the moment. We value this flexibility greatly. Our tours were to Eger and to Lake Balton, and we asked Orsolya to skip the ceramics part of the tour to Balaton and put in wine tasting. She not only did this (and we tried some really lovely wines), she anticipated our wanting to try wines on our Eger tour (we had not asked her) and she took us to a brilliant winery that had an amazing lunch and really great wines (Trummerer winery). Indeed, while Tripadvisor has no ability to add a review of Trummerer winery, we strongly recommend that anyone using Orsolya specifically ask her to take them to this winery for lunch and wine tasting."

It's hard not to like her exuberance and appreciation for Budapest and its amazing past and present. We saw so many sights in our day with Orsi, and felt that we were experiencing them with a friend. The driver we had in the morning was professional, courteous and made getting around to the various areas of the city so easy. The entire day was affordable, compared to private tour guides and cars in the more crowded destinations in the western part of Europe. We highly recommend Orsolya and her company Travel Guide Hungary."

Orsi took us not only to the major historical sights, but some other attractions that we otherwise would never have known about. She is extremely knowledgeable, and has such a sweet personality. She was born and raised in Budapest, and her enthusiasm for it's beauty is delightful to be around. We saw much of the city in one day, and at the end had a great appreciation for Hungarians. Orsi's love of her people was contagious. Don't go to Budapest with spending some time with her. She is amazing!"

We felt as if we met a family member. She was prompt and professional. She tailored the trip to our interests. The City is very \"walkable\" and she was enthusiastic and funny. She allowed us to make excellent use of our time. She was also very generous with her time. Never felt like she was on a clock or in a hurry.Her knowledge was deep but she made the rich and complex history very relatable for all of us (no easy task with 2 teenagers!). We are all still remembering that vacation so fondly and have Orsi to thank!!"

She was knowledgeable and fun to be with, Her enthusiasm for her country and Hungary's new freedom were almost as impressive as the sights and her knowledge of Budapest. See if you can arrange for her to take you on a tour of the Opera House when it is closed to the general public, or to the private room at the baths where the minnows will eat the dead skin from your feet. We loved Budapest, and we feel like we had a really good guide in Orsolya to show us around."

Not only was she very pleasant and well informed she gave us insights from her generation of the historical events that are affecting present day Hungary. It is very difficult for Americans to understand the complexities of being conquered and subjected by a suppressive foreign entity. Orsi gave us an enlightened perspective of not only the buildings and history of the city but a modern day outlook of a younger generation Hungarian to the pressures facing the evolution of their country. We strongly encourage future visitors to contact her and enjoy a wonderful tour."

She guided us to all the important sites by foot and public transfer, then called in a cab when the feet needed rest. While the historic information was plentifull, it was the little touches of coffee shop gems and fine restaurants that completed the day. Orsi becomes one of the group as opposed to traditional guides; her personality is well suited for this. Even as the day ended she left us with enough information to take care of a second day, such as a Danube Cruise (#7 pier!) and a half day at the public baths. This is a beautiful young lady who loves what she does, loves her city and loves life................and we would encourage others to seek her out. We found her on 'Toursbylocals'. Doog & Mikiman"

Orsolya's English is perfect, she is charming and has a university education that provided her with a wealth of knowledge about the history of Hungary, Budapest and its people. She loves to tell stories and historical anecdotes, which are really interesting to listen to. I would absolutely recommend Orsolya to any group, large or small. She can also give you tips on shopping and restaurants that are very useful. I left time to explore Budapest at the end of the day by myself, and Orsolya made sure I was pointed in the right direction."

We saw the specialized architecture, unique (kosher!) coffee shops, graffiti art, and the lack of a ghetto found in other European cities. Our guide told us of her own familiy's Jewish history, was full of anecdotes and humour. The tour includes admission to the magnificent Synagogue, paid for by the Emporer and designed by a Christian architect...no wonder it resembles a Cathedral! Also included was a personalized tour of the Jewish Heritage Centre where a very intense local curator took us through the exhibits in detail. The highlight for me was the memorial honouring Holocaust victims , a wonderful willow tree made of metal with names inscribed on every leaf. Heroes who helped to rescue Jews at great personal danger were also honoured (Wallenberg, Sir Nicholas Winton, local Catholic clergy etc).An unusual, educational, fun and satisfying tour!"

She was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about her subject and guided us around the various sites with absolute professionalism. The history lessons as we walked along the tour were superb. I found the visit to the Dohany Synagogue really interesting , especially as our guide was brought up as a Catholic but had been to a synagogue a number of times and was able to talk about many of the differences. Discussion around the tree of life was very poignant. I also leaned about the generosity of people like Estee Lauder and Tony Curtis.The visit to the museum - all included in the ticket price - was given by a different guide. This was also excellent, explaining some of the traditions in a little more detail than usual for the benefit of those who were not Jewish. It was also just the right length - 40 minutes.The entire tour is billed as 2.5 hours but lasted about 20 minutes longer.I would highly recommend the tour - a real 'must see' when visiting Budapest."

An incredibly beautiful building. It's the gardens that more the moist eyes to uncontrollable tears......mass graves of those locked in a ghetto during winter to starve and freeze to death. Take the time and show them your compassion as you wander the gardens and read through more than 2 thousand names on the wall of remembered everything. The tree of souls...it's impossible to be stirred even further......each leaf has a persons name on it and there are thousands upon thousands of names here.

Although Budapest can be a very beautiful place, it has a history of persecuting Jews and other individuals. It is important to learn from history or it will repeat itself. The Jews have lived in Budapest for many many years. They made valuable contributions to the city and to Hungary. They built beautiful synagogues However, they were also herded into a ghetto. The Jewish ghetto was mostly destroyed by the Nazis. The Jewish community was decimated. However, there are still many important sites from the Jewish community that remain . A tour of the history of the Jews in Budapest is an important part of visiting Budapest. Remember. Never again."

We went to the Orthodox synagogue on our own and was given a tour by someone at the synagogue. It is also beautiful.

We heard the Jewish quarter was not to be missed, so we headed here and ended up taking the walking tour and touring the synagogues. All the proceeds go toward the Jewish community and their post-WWII rebuilding efforts so we felt good about supporting this local organization. The Holocaust history in Hungary is horrific and shocking. I've toured several Holocaust memorials around the world. That dark moment in history is candidly and respectfully discussed here, with an expected local focus. However, it was so much more than that too, touching on post-war Hungarian-Jewish history, rebuilding, and the modern Jewish culture in Budapest. We are not Jewish and still found it to be fascinating, accessible, and well with the time. The synagogue was also worth touring. It is the 2nd largest in the world, the largest in Europe, and has a unique cathedral-like design that reflects local historical context. Ladies, one thing to note: you can't tour the synagogues unless your shoulders and knees are covered. We weren't dressed especially immodestly but one person in our group couldn't go in because her shorts were too short--a few inches above her knee. They do sell pashminas you can use to wrap around your waist as a skirt."

Our guide, Joel was trying to find an alternative location, but we instead decided to end the tour and ho on our way, to no fault of our guide.Joel was very knowledgeable about the sites we visited and answered many questions from our large group (about 20 of us, if not more). The majority of our time was spent at the Doh\u00e1ny Street Synagogue. There is a museum with many donated Jewish artifacts, which a different scheduled guide told us about. It was OK, but there were detailed placards that we could read as well, which would have been my preference - free time to select the items that we were interested. For the amount of money that we paid, I didn't feel like I was walking away with a bigger wealth of knowledge. However, this may be in part due to being in a large group."

Petra subsequently met us again to show and explain the buildings and the courtyards of the Synagogue including the Heroes' Temple, the Raoul Wallenberg Memorial Park and the Jewish Cemetery.

Our tour guide, Joel, was really knowledgeable and made the two and a half hours of the tour fly by. He shared both lots of information and his obvious love for the Jewish faith. Our tour group was an English speaking tour. It had people from several different countries and faith backgrounds. I recommend both the tour and the tour guide. Don't miss it. The inside of the synagogue is breathtaking. The history shown in the museum of what happened to the Jews in Hungary in WW2 is still heartbreaking."

The tour is very informative and heart wrenching. The initial part of the tour is a walk to the jewish neighbourhood, with stops on the way. Once we arrived at the Synagogue and museum, we were handed over to a guide who took us through the museum. She was also very knowledgeable and well spoken. We then went into the synagogue and then onto the garden with memorials and the tree of life etc. Very interesting and definitely worth the ticket and time. Petra is amazing and incredibly knowledgeable for a young person. I really enjoyed my time today learning about Jewish heritage."

Extended tour was useful though not essential if time limited as highlights were well covered on the basic tour. If you prefer a smaller group & have lots more questions to ask, then the extended tour may be helpful. Alternatively, you can see more by returning to the Great Synagogue and walking round the Jewish quarter on your own afterwards. Either way, highly recommended."

And as we toured, she kept the historic synagogues, museum, and other landmarks in perspective. We were impressed with the depth of Jewish history in Budapest, saddened by the reminders of the Holocaust, and moved by the vibrance of the present-day Jewish community. The Dohany Street Synagogue is spectacular, and one cannot believe that during Nazi occupation it was used as a stable and the headquarters of Eichmann. We saw in the museum Torah scrolls desecrated and used as tops of drums and articles of clothing. The monuments--the Tree, the monument to Raoul Wallenberg, Sir Nicholas Winton, and Chanah Senesch--were all moving, and we did not even see the shoes on the Danube. We also visited the Orthodox Synagogue which, like the Dohany, is still functioning. Petra, though a patriotic Hungarian, did not excuse her country's choosing the wrong side during WWII--a theme we heard often in Budapest. We concluded the tour with a treat at one of the several kosher restaurants in the Jewish Quarter."

But driving by a place and walking to it with a constant patter of information is not the same thing.Our tour guide was Petra. She is personable, enthusiastic, and speaks English well if with a slight accent. Although not a practicing Jew, she recently discovered she had Jewish ancestors and sought out to learn more about her religious roots. Thus, she is knowledgeable and speaks with great enthusiasm.We felt like we had plenty of time at all the sites we visited. Petra patiently answered any questions and we did not move on until she was satisfied that we were ready to go. I learned a great deal about the Jewish experience in Hungary throughout the centuries.In summary, Petra was a wonderful guide, we learned a great deal, and are glad we added this tour to our itinerary.

We decided to do the Jewish Qtr walk on our last morning in Budapest our Guide a young lady who knew her stuff and was bright and bubbly on our 45-50 min walk. We visited a virtually derelict synagogue and were given the introduction to the Holocaust and the low down on the Hungarian situation in 1943/5. As usual the facts were really shocking but I think everyone expected that.Our walk took us past another orthodox Jewish synagogue and round the boundary of the old ghetto where hundreds of thousands were squashed into tenements. Here and there were buildings from that time one tall \"end of terrace\" building was a moving site, now derelict.We returned to the Main Synagogue where there is a museum to the holocaust and the graves of 2,200 odd souls found at the site and in buildings where they were discovered by the Russians when they reoccupied the city.I didn't enter the synagogue by this time I was really uncomfortable.We were told that very few Budapest Jews actually still regularly practice their faith. I found this quite sad being a Christian.This is a good walk for the historian, Jewish folk and for the young. Our guide outside was superb in her knowledge.I can away with very mixed emotions. Through the marriage of a relative my family \"touched\" the holocaust and I have been deeply saddened by it. My strongest thought was that Jewery worldwide needs to harvest the young and especially those like our guide, who are fresh, bright, enthusiastic and full of life. 70 years one we should remember the horror of the past but embrace the potential of the future rather than dwell there?"

Two lovely senior ladies from The States and I were the only participants in the tour. Our tour guide, Petra, was caring and thoughtful. It was not a fine day, occasionally with heavy showers. Petra even provided raincoats for the two ladies. Her English was very fluent and she spoke very clearly. The poor weather did not diminish our guide's enthusiasm for the elaboration of the subject, nor our interest in the Hungarian Jewry's history and the visit. The highlight was the interior visit of the Dohany Street Synagogue. Magnificent! During the whole time, Petra demonstrated her professionalism and her understanding of what she was presenting. I feel that I was so lucky to encounter a guide who was actually immensely enjoying what she was doing. A very informative and memorable tour!Special thanks should also be given to the lady who guided us in the Jewish Museum. Unfortunately, I did not recall her name. With her presentation, I learnt so much about the history and the everyday life of the Jewish.Considering the price I paid, I have gained much more than I given. Highly recommended!"

It was just ourselves and two couples in the group, which made for a more intimate experience where we were always able to hear was Petra was saying and she was able to chat to us a little. Her English was perfect and although she wasn't Jewish, she did have a very thorough understanding of the Jewish community in Budapest, both past and present. The tour itself was good although I felt as if we didn't necessarily have enough time in each location. For instance, we visited the Holocaust Memorial Garden behind the Great Synagogue but didn't have any time to look around ourselves or reflect at all. Likewise a little more time looking around the Great Synagogue would be good. The guided tour of the Jewish Museum was excellent and I felt as if it was also very necessary as there was very little information in English about the artefacts. Again, however, the time there was quite limited so my sister and I chose to return later to take our time looking around.Overall, I would recommend this tour to anyone who is interested in learning more about the Jewish history of Hungary in a small group environment."

Although only 80 families belong to this lovely synagogue, it is being taken care of by tthe Jewish community. We next went to the Rumbach Synagogue, which is no longer acting as a functioning house of worship, but it is slowly being rebuilt. After a visit to a cafe in the area for coffee and a sweet treat, we went to the Dohany Street Synagogue. this is the largest synagogue in Europe, surviving WWII and beautifully restored to the splendor it is today. We also spent time at the Raoul Wallenberg Holocaust Memorial Park, as well as a tour of the Jewish Museum.Julianna shared her experiences with us, which were incredible. She is a remarkable woman and I appreciated what she went through to survive and how she continues with an incredible attitude toward the world.This was one of my favorite Jewish Ghetto tours!

It all started with our ( it seemed to us . our personal guide) guide FATIMA KOROK.. who picked us up and PERSONALLY guided us through the most knowledgeable and enjoyable tour of our whole trip to Eastern Europe.. ( can't we just adopt this beautiful young lady ????? )...We,being Jewish, and somewhat knowledgeable about Budapest Jewish history, we listened carefully as FATIMA filled in EVERY gap and then much more, in depth !!! We felt that were, actually, there and experiencing the history... There was not any nook and cranny in the Ghetto district that she did not have knowledge of.. period... Not only was she a GREAT guide but a better listener to our comments and questions..... How do we rate the tour ???..... 11+ on a scale of 10 and the numbers are not high enough to rate FATIMA. !!!!! Toby and I both love this young woman !!!!! Toby & Rich Hoffman"

It also tied in WWI, WWII, and Communism, which was great because we found many other places did not want to talk about Hungary's history in those areas. We had two guides - Fatima for the broader tour and Milka at the synagogue. Both were very knowledgeable and personable - I would strongly recommend this whether you are of Jewish Heritage or not."

We took the essential tour and on the day, we were fortunate to be the only 2 people booked in, so it was a very personal tour. It lasted 3 hours and our guide was Joel. He was brilliant! His knowledge of the history & culture of the Hungarian Jewish community was very extensive. However he did not give a lecture as some guides do, rather his approach was an interactive, conversational one. He shared some of his own experiences and helped us to gain an insight into the Jewish heritage that is an integral part of Budapest. He was very friendly and his English was excellent. Our tour included entrance into the Jewish Museum where the museum guide took over temporarily and into the second largest synagogue in the world. Joel was licensed to guide in the synagogue so we had a very interesting tour of the building and of the memorial gardens adjoining it. We highly recommend this walking tour - be sure and include it on your Budapest itinerary. Dorothy"

Esther did an excellent job giving us a sense of Budapest then and now and explaining the exhibits of Judaica and on the Holocaust. She then delivered us to Vatima (sp?), who took us to three synagogues and the memorial garden behind the Dohany. She had a very engaging style---asking us questions about what we saw so that we had to think first. All were delightful, intelligent, and knowledgeable. A great experience."

A downside to our Grand Tour (we were the only two people on it) was that we were given a 10% discount voucher to the Orthodox Hanna Restaurant but were taken to a different restaurant at the end of the tour. Unfortunately we did not realise this and only found out when we went to pay the bill and could not use the voucher. We also discovered later that the restaurant that gave the discount was practically next door so why we were not taken there in the first place we will never know."

The Basic Jewish Heritage Walking Tour Budapest, HungaryThere has been of resurgence of interest in European Jewish communities as they existed prior the WWII. In Krakow, Warsaw, and Prague, historical Jewish sites and synagogues enjoy numerous visitors daily as tourist flock to these venerable sites.For Jews and gentiles interested in the Hebrew traditions of Hungary, this is the tour for you. It is a walking tour so get ready with comfy walking shoes for this adventure. The tour operators describe in their publicity brochures that the Jewish walking tour of Old Budapest was created for those who would like to get an overview of the past and present history or the Hungarian Jewry and additionally would like to gain a perspective between the major religious wings of Hungarian Judaism.This walking tour requires the ability to walk between 2-4 hours depending on the tour selected. There are two types of Jewish heritage tours: (1) the essential basic tour which last about 2 hours; it costs 4900 or about \u00b1 $22.00 HUF (Hungarian forints); and (2) the grand tour an expanded Jewish Heritage tour which lasts between 3.5-4 hours at a cost of about 9900 HUF. or about \u00b1 $40.00 depending on the current exchange rate. I recommend taking the Grand Tour\u2014An Expanded Jewish Heritage Tour, however, I recommend doing so in two installments as I did. Walking the 4-hour complete tour is not recommended in the cobblestone and uneven terrain of Old Budapest. The tour company will gladly accommodate you so that you can do the basic tour one day in the morning and the second part of the tour on a following day in the afternoon.In this review I will focus on the morning tour. In my next review I will focus on the second tour hours of the tour in order to provide a complete review of the Grand Tour\u2014An Expanded Jewish Heritage Tour. The main stop of the basic morning tour includes: (1) the Dohany Street Synagogue with a guided tour featuring the interior and exterior features and storied history of the second largest synagogue in the world, (2 ) a Jewish museum of photographs various artifacts including antique Jewish-motif dinnerware and a stunning collection of classic menorahs of varied constructions and sizes, and (3) the Martyr\u2019s cemetery-Holocaust museum park. The latter includes the \u201cTree of Life\u201d exhibit. These three are part of the same gated complex. Noteworthy, is the fact that in this site was the apartment where Theodore Herzl, founder of the political form of Zionism, a movement to establish a Jewish homeland, was born and lived for a while during his childhood when Hungary was part of the Austria-Hungarian Empire.Main stop and points of interest are 1-14; 1-7 basic tour; all 14 part of the grand tour. Here follows the description of the items by the numbers assigned by the tour operators with my annotations.The Basic Tour 1. The Jewish Museum with local professional guidance was an phenomenal part of the tour. Conducted by a knowledgeable Judaica scholar who significantly raised the cultural and educational level of the tour, the local Jewish Museum Guide provided an expert explanation of the numerous antique Judaica and historical artifacts exhibited in the museum. Examples of artifacts include antique paintings of daily Jewish life in old Hungary, preserved ketubahs (marriage contacts) as old as 1681 are exhibited in the museum. Additionally, an outstanding set of antique ornate menorahs are displayed and other artifacts of historical significance to the Jewish people. The tour guide did a terrific job of providing important historical details of the place which collectively provides a significant education on Hungarian Judaica.2. The visit to the interior of the Dohany Street Synagogue is truly inspiring religious experience. Whether one is Jewish or gentile, one feels a profound religious experience visiting this great temple which is difficult to verbalize. It is just that kind of a place. It is an awesome site to be present and behold this great synagogue. Its grand interior architecture, its majestic construction and its reverent decorum is palpable. Christians and especially Jewish visitors cannot but marvel and take pride in this symbol of spirituality and resilience of the Jewish people who survived the Hungarian Holocaust. This synagogue with its unique architectural features and its reverence for Judaism is a place to be experienced by all who visit Budapest.3. The Martyr\u2019s Cemetery is a monument dedicated to thousands of Jewish martyrs killed by the Nazis from the nearby Hungarian Ghetto. The headstones of these known victims and those yet to be documented are added frequently are memorialized here with the decorum of engraved black marble headstones bearing their names, and their estimated dates of birth and death.4. The Raoul Wallenberg Memorial Park exhibits a fitting life-sized dedicatory plaque memorializing the work of the Swedish businessman and diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg, who is best known for saving thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II. 5. The Tree of Life Exhibit is constructed out of stainless steel whose more than 70,000 \u201cleaves\u201d commemorates the names of those who died in the Hungarian Holocaust during the final stages of WWII under the Nazi occupation of Budapest. It is a beautiful and unique exhibit honoring the life of the Hungarian martyrs who perished here. 6. An outside tour of The Heroes\u2019 Temple built in memory of the Jewish soldiers who gave their lives for Austria-Hungary during WWI concludes the tour. 7. After the tour, it is possible to visit the Jewish Center with movies and exhibitions about Jewish history. It is fitting to note that it was through the Emanuel Foundation for Hungarian Culture, founded by the great American actor, Tony Curtis, in honor of his father whose focus on Budapest and the aforementioned complex that helped restore the ancient Dohany Synagogue, built a Jewish Centre, erected the Holocaust memorial tree on its grounds, and built a Raoul Wallenberg Park, to honor righteous gentiles who saved Jewish lives. This is a truly worthwhile tour and I highly recommend as a satisfying cultural and educational experience.John Orta, La Cresecenta, CA, USA, 12/22/2014 jorta@pacbell.net"

We did the half-day \"Grand Tour\" and thoroughly enjoyed it -- it introduced us to a fascinating mix of synagogues, the main Jewish Museum, local shops, and other bits of local color.Both of our guides (Fatima led most of the tour, while Esther escorted us during the visit to the Jewish Museum) were very knowledgeable young people from Budapest. They pitched their material just right -- not too basic but not too detailed, either -- and both of them were very open to fielding questions.After visiting the Doh\u00e1ny Street Synagogue with Fatima, we spent about an hour with Esther in the Jewish Museum, where there were many well-presented objects on display from both Hungary and Austria. We appreciated that the exhibits told much more than the story of the community during the Holocaust, and we were especially intrigued to learn how active the community is today (about 80,000 to 100,000 members in Hungary).In the second half of the tour, Fatima brought us to the Carl Lutz Memorial, as well as to several shops and restaurants in the still-scruffy-but-gentrifying Jewish Quarter. We appreciated that this part of the tour was very low-keyed and not at all a \"hard sell\" pushing particular products.The \"Grand Tour\" was a great introduction to the history of the Jewish community in Budapest. We highly recommend taking the time to do the half-day version with these very knowledgeable guides."

We\u2019ve used them in cities all over the world, and I can\u2019t think if one as good as Ann anywhere. She arrives on time and has a new van that can easily hold six. She\u2019s a native and her English is perfect with just enough accent to be fun. She has quite a sense of humor. She lays out a tour having already purchased the needed tickets and knows preciously when to go to some things, when a matter of minutes will reduce the crowd size dramatically, etc. She\u2019s skilled at reading her clients and quickly learned which things we\u2019d like to see, which we\u2019d likely pass on , which we\u2019d like to pause at and which we could move thru quickly. Her stories are full of critical historical facts which give one a whole new perspective on the critical events in time, all presented in an engaging manner. If you want to experience Budapest, be sure to make advance reservations with Anni Fischer."

She managed the group really well, despite vastly differing levels of knowledge within the group about Jews and the Holocaust in Hungary. She has an engaging way of asking questions, and is happy when someone knows the answer, but equally happy to provide it if not. The tour covers the main sites in the ghetto, and after the Wallenberg Memorial Park I was lucky enough to have the rest of the tour as a private one. This enabled me to ask many more questions, and Fatima is patient and happy to explain minutiae. The history is fascinating, in particular the 3 radically different streams of Judaism that built their synagogues here, and the architecture reflects their liberalism or not accordingly. The Jewish museum offers a great insight into Jewish life for those less familiar with Jewish ritual and customs.Don't just visit the Dohany synagogue and think you've seen Jewish Budapest - I would really recommend Fatima as a guide, and recommend the tour as offered by Hungaria Koncert Ltd."

We learned so much about Jewish life in Budapest in the past and now. I was relieved to see that the anti-antisemitism I was expecting to be rampant was not. This doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but it was less than I had been led to believe. The Dohany Utca Synagogue is lovely and very interesting. The rest of the walking tour helped us understand history. Don't forget to go see the shoes on the Danube while you are there."

Ambrus then explained some of the history of the Holocaust cemetery and the Tree of Life memorial which was funded by Tony Curtis. The tour took almost 2 hours and cost 4500HUF. I have mixed feelings about whether this tour was worth the money or whether it would be just as good to pay the entrance fee to the synagogue and museum and see the rest independently.

Only at the end did Roland volunteer that he wasn't Jewish! he knew EVERYTHING--obviously the history of the Jews in Hungary and as well, most of the Jewish customs and traditions that I will guarantee most Jews don't even know. A knowledgable and gifted young man as he \"negotiated\" with the orthodox volunteer at the shul to let me in and look at a Siddur to note similarities between the Hungarian service and the one that I knew growing up in the US.....note : they are the same service and siddur (minus the English language) except for the front page that stated \"published in Brooklyn, USA\" Quite funntI recommend this tour especially Roland Hajd--a real mensch."

She's very fluent in english, very friendly and has the gift to make alive what happened during world war II. Not a summary of historical places and data but a real movie bringing you back to the thirties and the forties. During the visit to the jewish museum, guides of the museum accompany the visitors. A mustif you want to understand something of the jewish culture and reasoning and their very explicit views and insights on life and death and history. I quickly understood I will never understand them perfectly : almost another planet.

I haven't been one to typically take time to document reviews like this, but felt compelled based on the amazing day I had in Budapest last Saturday. I had the opportunity to spend a weekend (with a single day to tour) in Budapest and wanted to make the most of it. After doing some research online, I selected Budapest Locals to help me tour the city and I could not have made a better choice.From the initial contact with Anita, it was great. She was super responsive and asked great questions that would help match a guide. As it turned out, my guide and friend for the day was Detti and she was a perfect match. Detti, a teacher of English as a second language to HS students AND teacher of Hungarian as a second language to foreign university students, was super knowledgeable about the city, Hungary's history, and its traditions. She was flexible and tailored the day as we went - spending more time in some places that proved of interest and moving past others. We ducked into off the beaten path places for strudel, some typical Hungarian street food, and capped the day with some goulash. She was able to help me translate (and piece together some memories) of things my Grandfather said to me in Hungarian when I was little. I got great pictures of the must see stops and she made sure we did so at the right time (like seeing the Parliament from the Buda side at night). She was patient and totally went out of her way to make sure I got the most out of my day.This was the first tour like this I've taken and I was really really pleased. Anita, thanks for making it work on 1 week's notice and Detti, thanks for making it exactly what I was looking for....a connection to my Hungarian heritage!"

We also went to a restaurant for lunch the following day that Barbie had recommended called Menza and that too was fab! Even the small things of jumping on the Metro, it was so handy that Barbie had shown us how it all worked for when we used it the following day on our own.If you do the 7-8 hour tour with Barbie, please do not eat breakfast! You have so much food throughout the day as Barbie likes for you to experience all food things Hungarian (I also think she could be a secret feeder!). My favourite food was the Hungarian Chimney cake.....it's a must try!

Our wonderful guide, Bridget, picked us up at our B&B and for the next 6 hours took us all around Budapest to see the sights and sample local Hungarian food. First, she asked us where we had been and if there were any places we would like to see. We mentioned that we hadn't seen St. Stephen's cathedral yet, so we went there and she gave us a guided tour of the inside of the cathedral and the up outside the dome. After that we went to the Great Market Hall, as it closes early on Saturday. There we sampled salami, pickles, pork fat, goulash and rolled cabbage. Then we went to a pastry shop and had four different kinds of cake, including the Birthday Cake that won the competition this year of the best in Budapest. Now, wanting to walk off some of this food, we headed to the Jewish corner to see the Synagogue and experience the Ruined Bar. Bridget asked us if we wanted to try some strudel at her favourite place, but by that time we were too full to eat anymore (We didn't need to eat dinner that night!).In between and during all the eating, Bridget explained a lot interesting information about the local history, culture and people. There was so much that we gained from this tour that we could not have found out on our own. She really was flexible in terms of accommodating our wishes for what we wanted to see, do, and eat. There was a fair bit of walking but we also got to experience riding the Metro and trams in the city, which we appreciated.All in all, this was well worth our time and money (all the expenses during the tour are covered by the cost of the tour) for our own private guided tour of Budapest. K\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m, Bridget! And thank you, Anita for your quick responses to our emails."

We stopped for coffee and pasties early in the day and cocktails at the end in the Jewish district. She was extremely well informed and we enjoyed our time with her very much even to point that after 4.5 hours we had to catch our transfer we didn't want it to end."

From the initial contact with Anita to the culmination of this tour, this tour was a home run. By the time we did this tour, we had been in Budapest for a few days, and we wanted to see more of the Pest side with a few highlights of the Buda side. The tour was fantastic, and Barbie was an amazing tour guide. The tour is quite detailed and not rushed at all, as it took around 8 hours to do the complete tour. We enjoyed the logistics of the tour as we were able to walk but also used the city public transportation during the tour. Barbie is quite passionate about the history of her country and provided insightful recommendations about places to visit such as the House of Terror. The tour will take you to places of interest that you would not think of exploring on your own; such as the local market. The entire tour was excellent, and we highly recommend this tour for anyone who wants to experience Budapest a little deeper than the surface."

All my questions and helpful advice given freely even before confirming my booking.On the day Brigitta (Bridget) met us at the Opera Hotel by K+K at the agreed hour 10am (she was already waiting for us and had already picked up our 24 hour local transport passes (included) to avoid us having to wait in line. Brigitta was excellent and the pace was gentle without being slow. All refreshments strudel, coffee water and fabulous lunch in the market were included in the agreed price for our 6 hour tour. On our return we received the promised recipes and a most courteous request for feedback on our day.Being retired hoteliers and still hotel consultants we really do appreciate excellent service and Budapest Locals know exactly how to provide that. Would recommend them most highly. We felt really safe exploring areas we otherwise would probably not have felt comfortable exploring on our own. Brigitta even helped us negotiate a good price on some beautiful Hungarian linen in the market. Budapest is a beautiful city and we will probably be back for more. Thank you Anita and Brigitta."

I was here on business visiting Budapest for my first time. As this was a business trip, I had not done a lot of pre-planning. I contacted Budapest Locals on Friday seeking a private tour on Saturday, not sure if this would be possible. Budapest Locals (Anita) quickly replied and had my tour guide, Orsi, lined up for me on Saturday. She asked me what type of tour I was interested in and what time I would like to start and gave me options of tour ideas in the initial email. It made it easy for me to select the tour option and start time I wanted. Orsi was right on time the next morning to meet me in the lobby of my hotel - she started by showing me the map and the plan she had made for us and asked if I wanted to make any changes. I didn't and off we went. I can't say enough about Orsi - my interest whenever I go to a new city, especially those steeped in culture, is to really understand the history. Of couse I wanted to see the sights, but when you are with someone who knows so many details about the statue or building you are standing in, it adds that much more to the experience. I was amazed at Orsi's knowledge about the history of Budapest and Hungary. It was clear that she loved history and loved being a tour guide. She was so friendly and attentive to my questions and focused on ensuring I was getting what I wanted out of the tour. We took a little longer in some areas and were running out of time, but Orsi stayed with me an extra hour to cover the items on the list. She even left me with recommendations with what to do with the rest of my time in Budapest and typed in local restaurant recommondations on my phone so that I could locate them later in the weekend with Google Maps. Orsi went above and beyond - I couldn't have asked for anything more!!! Anita also followed up with me after the tour was completed making sure I enjoyed it, letting me know Orsi did as well and offered email assistance for any further advice I needed for the rest of my stay here - just ask. That is customer service! Orsi was a wonderful, wonderful guide - I can't recommed her and Budapest Locals enough - I was already giving verbal recommendations out to fellow American travellers I met later that same evening in Budapest. Thank you Orsi and Anita for such a wonderful and fulfilling experience!"

A 1/2 hour prior to taking off from Heathrow, we went through TA, identified 2 well rated tour agencies and shot out quick e-mails.Within the 1/2 hour prior to take off, Anita from Budapest Locals had already responded. We asked, half expecting a negative response, if we could secure a tour within 2-hours of our landing crafted to our specific passions; Food and history. Not only was Anita quick but she was impressively constructive suggesting a guide who is passionate about food and working to make sure she could accommodate us as she was currently on tour. By the time we landed in Budapest 2.5 hours later, we were confirmed to go which was pretty impressive. Our guide, Barbie was absolutely phenomenal! She quickly led us to the Great Hall market where we started with a wonderful Hungarian Ghoulash and Spritzer. This was just the start of our culinary adventure as we wandered the market and had all sorts of exotic treats including cold cuts, an assortment of pickled vegetables (who knew these could be so scrumptious) and several other local Hungarian dishes. What I loved about Barbie is her knowledge of Hungarian geography and culture really complemented the tour as she peppered our tour with all sort of tid bits about the foods origins, regions of consumption, local preparation techniques etc. The rest of the tour consisted of a visit to coffee and confectionary shop which was an inspired choice and where we feasted on a variety of cakes including the Hungarian national cake. We finished our tour at Simplza Kert, a ruin hangout (think of alternate artsy hangout that would have been vogue in Willuamsburg a few years ago, but probably now in Bushwick, Brooklyn). Barbie hang out with us way past her 'official' time and led us back to the hotel after an exhausting but wonderful afternoon (all this took place between 2:30pm and around 9pm). Anita (who owns Budapest Locals) and Barbie have been wonderful with follow on e-mails including recipies of the dishes we sampled. Great after sales service! One final aspect we really appreciated was Barbie's knowledge and candidness around Hungarian history. The 20th century was a tough one for Hungary and Barbie led us by sites of historical significance and gave an informed, thoughtful and balanced perspective of the country's history and how it is dealing with ramifications today. Overall, and we do not say this lightly as seasoned travelers, one of the most memorable and personalized tours we have ever taken."

I wanted a tour that went into depth of the history, its food and a perspective of what there is to do, as I was going to be there for a week. So I booked the 8 hour tour. It was the best decision I made, as it made the rest of my stay so much more interesting and fun!On the day, it was pouring with rain, this did not slow us down. I met Brigitta in the lobby armed both with umbrellas and we were set for the 8 hour adventure! The trip was all planned out and she had a wealth of information to share. If I had already seen something she was also flexible enough to change the course to add something else into its place. We also visited places that I would never have found on any tourist map. That made it even more exciting to experience it like a local. There was so much food to also try on the trip! If you every get the chance try the Cabbage Strudel i'm now addicted to it.I highly recommend this tour and would use them again in a heartbeat."

She made all the arrangements with Anita via Internet and my tour guide, Barbie, was at the pier where my AMA Water cruises ship was docked. Precisely on schedule. I chose the Jewish Secrets tour and was very happy with it. Barbie is very knowledgeable about Hungarian history and the Jewish quarter aside from being a delightful and charming person to be with. She was also most considerate about asking if we were moving too fast. Her English is impeccable and she also speaks French and planning to learn Spanish.I wish I had planned on spending a few more days in Budapest. Beautiful city, delightful people.I highly recommend Budapest Locals Guided Tours."

Just after the first 5 minutes I knew it was the right decision to choose these guys. I was looking for a combination of sightseeing and some other funny stuff which cannot be missed on a bachelors party. The Budapest Locals made up an individual program which was just great. We have seen the most beautiful sites of Budapest and tested many local specialties of food and beverages. Our two tour guides entertained our group of 12 people in every second and let time of 6 hours go by in a flash.If I will ever go back to Budapest, I do not need to look on Tripadvisor again \u2013 I know already who I have to contact!Thanks a lot!"

This was an 8 hour tour. She was personable, gentle, thoughtful and mindful of when a break was appropriate or when to push off. We walked, hopped on trains, buses and trams. We tried local treats as fruit strudels of many varieties. But we particularly loved the cabbage strudel. At the Central market she bought us lunch and other yummy delights as exotic sausages and pickles. Have you had a watermelon pickle? Go with these folks and they'll show you. We had the best goulash in the market. At the Jewish Quarter we were treated to a Flodni a yummy pastry. She even helped make a reservation for our evening meal in the neighbourhood.She gave us enough historical background of the genesis of this country through the difficult years to contemporary times. My group of 4 enjoyed not only the tour but also the personality of our guide. Thanks again to Bridget."

We can both confidently say that this was money & time spectacularly spent to get the most out of Budapest. As we stayed on the Buda side, we opted to visit sites on the Pest side during the tour. Our tour guide, Barbie, was extremely flexible, kindly starting with breakfast because we had not eaten yet. Barbie was very personable and full of information! We could not have asked for a better time. Anita, who facilitated the scheduling of the tour, was easy to work with and gave great suggestions for places to visit that would not be covered on the tour.

We met Bridget where we were staying, she was armed with a 24 hour transport pass and off we went to a number of destinations. We started with some Strudel and I personally was delighted to learn that Strudel need not be sweet, it can be savory. We sampled cabbage strudel, sour cherry, cheese (kind of like a ricotta), apricot, poppyseed and more. We then went on a tour of the major Cathedral (St. Istvan), and a walk through the Jewish quarter. This was food tour + general tour and orientation to Budapest. We went to the Great Market, had some incredible pickles, Goulash, Amazing Langos, Fried Sausage, untried sausage, etc. I know it sounds like a meat fest but we had one near vegetarian and one non beef eater in the bunch, and yet everyone was happy. We went to a fantastic bakery where we sampled half a dozen desserts, and finished up at a \"Ruin\" bar. This was a great tour and Bridget was lovely. I plan to try some pickle recipes when I get home. For those of you considering doing the tour, I point out the following. 1. There is some walking, but in my opinion not too much--very reasonable. 2. I have come away with a new appreciation of Hungarian (Magyar) food. If you have specific dietary restrictions, point them out, I am confident that Bridget or her friends can accommodate. That said, I would put aside your preconceived notions and instead, learn to say \"Yes, I will try that.\" My guess is that if you are on a food tour you have figured out that you can learn a lot about a culture from its food, why deprive yourself of learning by saying no. I get it if it is a deeply held religious belief...3. This is a great way to see the city. Its also a great family activity. At the end of the day you can talk about both \"what was the coolest thing you saw today, and ... what was the best thing you ate today\"4. A tour like this will help you make the most out of your dining time in Budapest. I have nothing against Pizza and Doner Kebab, but there is so much to explore in this cuisine, it is nice to have an orientation."

Gaby began Budapest's complex history at Heroes' Square and wove more stories about her home country into her narration as the tour continued. We asked lots of questions which she answered thoughtfully. We especially loved strolling through idyllic City Park and past the baths, a few minutes observing worship at the Basilica of St. Stephen, the Strudel House goodies, then the magnificent views from Fisherman's Bastion and the Castle area. The tour made our visit to Budapest absolutely memorable! It was easy to arrange online and confirm details once we arrived."

            "review": "Fantastic tour with everything made easy!. My wife and I along with our 2 young daughters (9 and 11). Went on a Budepest Locals Tour with Bridget recently and we could not have asked for a better experience. Setting up our tour with Anita could not have been easier. We had an easy email exchange where Anita gave me all the information on the tour along with pricing which I felt was very reasonable considering the service you receive. Even after some delays where we had to change our arrival into Budapest, Anita and Bridget made it easy on us by adjusting their service to our revised schedule. The tour itself was very comprehensive where we blended some standard sites with things that Bridget thought we may like to see after getting to know what we wanted to do . Some tours can be rigid in their itinerary but this was not one of those tours, Bridget was very flexible and genuinely cared that we were satisfied with what we were seeing. The best part of the tour was how Bridget paid extra attention to our girls and was not afraid to communicate with them on their level so that they enjoyed the tour as much if not more then we did, she also really went above and beyond in trying to give us and our girls a true taste of the Hungarian culinary experience. Budapest Locals as a company is very generous in including all of that in the tour. Thank you Bridget! All in all this was a wonderful tour and the ladies of Budapest Locals are wonderful people. The service they provided us even after the tour was remarkable and very generous, answering any questions we had and always quick in giving us a suggestion to make our stay in Budapest the best it could be. We highly recommend Budapest Locals and we truly feel that if you are looking for a top notch tour group your search should end once you see how great a company this is!"

When I booked with Anita I mentioned that we were all really looking forward to a good days tour as it was my friends birthday. Bridget met us at our apartment with a small gift of deliscious local marzipan chocolates for the birthday boy! She asked us if we had any special requests of where we wanted to go and gave us a few suggestions too. We spent the next few hours travelling around the city on the metro and trams (all included in the price) Bridget's knowledge of local attractions and history was amazing and she really enjoyed showing us her beautiful city. She bought us water to keep us going and took us to a lovely cafe for drinks and an amazing selection of strudels (again all included in the tour price). The tour gave us a great overview of Budapest and Bridget told us what trains, buses and trains to get in the following days to enable us to see more of the things we wanted to see and do. The tour ran over by more than an hour but Bridget was fine with that as she was going home after we finished. We told her to go and leave us and we would make our own way back to our apartment but she insisted on taking us back. We all had a really fantastic afternoon with Bridget and can't recommend them highly enough. What we learnt on our tour enabled us to make the most of our few days in Budapest. Thanks so much to Bridget and Anita xx"

Being here for two days before our Viking tour we wanted to have a tour that would take us to places other than where we would go on the included Viking tour. Bridget was not only very pleasant and patient, her English was excellent. We would not hesitate to recommend her. I noticed that Budapest Locals did not have as many reviews as other tour companies but I can assure you that it was only because they only started their own agency about a year ago. The quality of survive was GREAT. My favorite place was Liberty Square to learn about the history of the monuments - opposing Soviet and US as well as the Hungarian monument to those who died in WWII. Her explanation of the monument itself and the \"protest monument\" to honor those of Jewish decent who were killed by Hungarians as well as Nazis was very moving and interesting.I also liked that the tour included a public transportation ticket for 24 hours which we later used to go to the bath house. It was so easy to use the metro to get there after Bridget explained the route and system. P.S.The stop for strudel was yummy!"

It was a delightful day despite the cold weather. I contacted Budapest locals after reading many TripAdvisor reviews based on their positive reviews, their all cost included policy and group instead of per person pricing.

She was very capable of answering any question we had and gave us a great overview of both contemporary Budapest culture and historical context. She was very friendly and we definitely felt well looked after for the tour. We started the day with a strudel breakfast after being met right at the door of our accommodation, followed by a leisurely walk around one of the historical districts of the city. After a short tram ride we went to the market hall for a very fulsome lunch, then finished with cake and palinka. Even though Bridget had a well planned tour she was very happy to adapt based on what we wanted to see. We would highly recommend the tour and Bridget as a great way to experience Budapest in a personal, friendly, and contemporary way!"

I picked hem because of the strong reviews and also because for the same price we were able to get a 5.5 hour private tour while other companies were group tours. This was the first time we did a food tour of a city and it was great. Bridget was our guide and we really enjoyed spending time with her. It was like walking around a new city with a friend. She was very personable and had was very knowledgeable about the city, it's history and of course the food!  She was flexible with our plans and while we ate strudels for breakfast (which were delicious) Bridget went over a rough idea of what she had planned for us. We actually had done quite a few of the things the previous day and she quickly made other suggestions to see where else we would want to go. The central market hall was great and we had a ton of different food to try, we couldn't even finish it all. Bridget did a great job explaining about the different types of cuisine and talking about the typical Hungarian recipes and ingredients. We had a great day exploring with her, and she gave us good reccamendations and tips on getting around the city and places to go as well. The follow up from Anita and the Budapest locals was great as well. She reached out to me while we were still in Budapest and offered to help us with anything if we needed it. She also followed up with a separate email with recipes of several Hungarian dishes as well. I would highly reccamend using Budapest locals and go as far to say it t was one of the best tours that I've done so far in all my travels. Bridget was a great guide and had a great blend of friendliness, warmth, professionalism and information."

Everything was covered, public transportation (which made it easier on later outings), coffee breaks and lunch. Anita shared her love for her city and shared her interest in cooking from helping us find \"just the right\" paprika to explaining about \"Beigli\" a walnut or poppy roll that is a traditional holiday treat. I have wonderful memories, but am so glad I can look back at pictures since there were so many things to see (like watching bakers make strudel.) Comfortable shoes are a must as is a camera."

            "review": "Fantastic Family Day with Budapest Locals and Anita. Family travel typically is a 'do it yourself' event for us, but our trip to Budapest was most positively influenced by our decision to have Budapest Locals show us the way. Anita arrived on time and quickly established a rapport with my family, including two teen aged boys. Our plan for the day was clearly explained with maps and enough flexibility to allow us each to enjoy our unique preferences. Using the public transportation is an excellent way to see Budapest and Anita's made sure we watched her purchase our tickets and learned how to purchase tickets on our own. These daily tickets saved us money and time the following day. We selected the entire day tour (8 hours +) and ended very satisfied and informed (and well fed!). Anita's first-hand experience and stories of growing up in the area made the city much accessible and vibrant, especially when compared to the harsh history of the 20th century. She was a good source for me to learn more of the city's historical culture as part of my own newly discovered genealogy connection. It was as though we spent the day with an old friend. Anita's recommendations and logistical instructions for the following day when we were alone were spot on. We were able to see and do everything on our list and still had time to explore. If walking is not an issue in your daily life, I'd suggest avoiding hiring a private car / bus. The traffic and difficulty for parking would eat up your time trying to find your driver (as well as eat up money with the added expense). The trams and buses were not difficult at all after experiencing them first-hand with Anita. We stayed on the Pest side (near the main train station) and used Anita's recommendations based on our hotel location and map directions to explore the following day. The personal touch, public transportation and walking tour method is perfect for Budapest and I recommend Budapest Locals to help any visitor to this very fine city."

The best thing we can say about the tour was that our kids (6 and 9) were engaged the whole time. Barbie was so knowledgeable about Budapest and talked about the history of the city like only a local could do. After 2 days we gained such a huge appreciation for the city and we could have never learned so much from just wandering by ourselves with a map. Breaks were timed perfectly and the places we stopped always had something yummy. We felt very comfortable with Barbie and our kids saw her as a big sister by the end of our second day. She paid close attention to what we liked so the tour never felt like it was a standardized agenda. We loved that we took public transportation to and from a lot of places (and a lot of walking in between) so at the end of our two days we really felt like locals. We really enjoy touring European cities with private tour companies and Budapest Locals was one of the best experiences we have had. We would highly recommend Budapest Locals to anyone interested in getting to know the real Budapest."

Informative, really interesting and also very genuine and generous in her approach.

Conversation was interactive and we felt very involved versus being talked at. We visited all the key places of historical interest , as well as some other interesting highlights such as morning coffees and strudel at a well known local strudel house, Hungarian lunch at the food markets, and Palinka shots at a Ruin bar later in the day ( totally optional but we were keen to taste!)

If you want to know where the best places for food next to the Great Market Hall are, Barbara knows the answer and will tell you about it whether you want a lovely sweet snack, have a coffee or go out for dinner. Don\u2019t miss the traditional goulash soup during your stay. Barbara was very keen on giving advice about public transporting as well and bringing her guests to places where they can go on with their journey. Always very friendly, she made her guests feel more than welcome. Moreover she helped to organize tickets for a tour of the Budapest Parliament which I definitely would recommend.

Before our arrival, Anita was in frequent contact to ensure that she planned the perfect tour for us.

Anita came to meet us at the hotel at 11am and we immediately felt at home in her company. She spoke to us about our itinerary then took us to the strudel house where we tasted an incredible selection of strudels - delicious! She also gave us a welcome gift of paprika which I will use to make goulash soup. We enjoyed the snack stops during the sightseeing which was a great opportunity to refuel and taste the local cuisine. Public transport was included in the price and the ticket that Anita bought allowed us to travel until 11am the next day. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the market where we ate even more. Anita, knowing that I like baking, bought me ground poppy seeds which are hard to find in the UK so that I can try making some of the delicious cakes at home. When we got home, she sent me a number of easy to follow recipes (she also works in a cookery school). Whilst in Budapest we did encounter problems with a certain taxi firm and Anita helped us tremendously, this was 2 days after the tour! I cannot thank Anita enough for making our visit to Budapest so special. We can't wait to return and will recommend Anita to our friends!"

Anita was easy to deal with prior to arrival and turned up on time at out hotel as planned. She took care of passes for travel, and her introduction to the geography and use of public transport saved a fortune (and was quicker) than getting cabs.The history of the city is fascinating (and traumatic too), but her knowledge was detailed and entertaining. She also had a sense of humour, and showed us most of the sights and places of interest (highlighting ones that we could see in more detail later).Finally, even after the tour (which included a lovely coffee and pastrie break), she stayed in touch and booked a river boat cruise for us. To cap it all she sent some simple Hungarian recipes for us to have a go at when we got home.Cannot recommend highly enough."

From the very first day I have contacted her to agree the tour details was such an informative and pleasant. It was a must tour for us in Budapest as a visitors first time for just 3 days and annita managed to show us the real flavour of the city, with its hystory, culture, people and hidden things that we feel like part of the story. Even the advices, recommendations she gave us was really helpfull. Definitely recomend to take the tour in Charming Budapest all you need is to relax prepare yourselve and enjoy the story of the city."

Our guide was extremely helpful and knowledgable, and she artfully blended information on Budapest and important monuments while directing us through public transit. I don't usually care for the sweet pastries that filled a lot of the trip, but they were quite good. I judge all other food tours from this one: a guided tour through a city, interrupted by stops for local delicacies that have their own stores."

If you are visiting Budapest and you have a passion for discovering local cuisine while learning about Hungary's history then stop what you are doing and immediately book a tour with Budapest Locals. Anita met us at our Airbnb flat and guided us through several cafes, shops, bars, markets and historical sites. The sheer volume of food was impressive. I'm a big eater and this tour challenged me. We donated some of the leftover food to some homeless folks in the subway station and we STILL had leftovers to take with us. Delicious Strudel, cakes, sausage, pork tenderloin, langosh, pork cracklings, cheeses, spreads, pickles, stuffed peppers, stuffed cabbage. You name it, if it's Hungarian cuisine, we probably ate that too. To make it even better, Anita would pay for everything on the spot, and basically bring everything to us -food, beers, palinka, whatever we asked for. This tour is maybe one of the best values I've come across in my travels. Very very impressive. The historical insight was also wonderful. Hungary has a long, interesting and complex history that Anita explained effortlessly. Absolutely fantastic. Do it. You will not be disappointed."

And I am so happy I have chosen Budapest Locals! Even before we arrived I received enormous support from Anita. She was very helpful, attentive and just nice to deal with. We really did not feel how time passed: a nice walk, interesting stories and in-depth knowledge of history of Hungary. It was a real pleasure. Anita is really a very nice company and a great story-teller. We both appreciated how the tour was designed and customized for us. Overall - I can only recommend.

Recovering from a sprained 73 year old knee, she kept the walking to a minimum, but still saw a lot of the essentials for a first visit to Budapest. Since I enjoy public transport , the trams, buses and metro were part of the fun. (I even followed Gaby's suggestion and rode the no. 2 tram the next day) And the stops for strudel and then the meal in the largest market hall I have ever seen were timed perfectly. (Beware of the spicier peppers!) A whole floor dedicated to pickled anything. like pickled \"baby\" watermelon! And don't miss Buda. As Gaby told me, those who don't live in Buda wish they did.And the stories go on. Hippos have their own spa. Ice skating . . . . A delighful day - could not have been better. Thank you Gaby and Anita."

These ladies offer a different, personalised and definitely \"insider's\" experience, which we completely recommend. Anita organised things well through email and followed up afterwards (including some recipes), both very professional and friendly. Gaby was a real star as our guide. She is lovely person who gave us the best private tour we have had in a number of places in several countries. It was thoughtfully different from usual mass tours without being restrictive or too quirky.She has a delightful personality and coped with aplomb with our attempts to navigate overly icy streets, adjusted the tour accordingly while never making us feel rushed, and always made all 3 of us feel as though we were walking and talking with a companion and friend, all in excellent English. She showed a great knowledge of her city and gave us much information and many insights, and answered all our questions, often with a personal flavour being a \"local\". But she also obviously has a real passion for her city, its culture - and its cuisine - and conveyed that as well. The lunch stop at the Market, the 2 cafe stops (strudel and cake) and drinks at the ruin bar were all great (and delicious) and well timed for those not used to walking all day. Her selections in each case were delightful.The tour itself was well structured to cover many major sites from Heroes' Square to the Castle & St Matthias and made very good use of public transport - allowing some time in less touristy aspects of the city. Since Gaby picks you up and returns you to your hotel, each tour must be individually tailored around a common core. No leaving you to wander around town trying to find, or get home from, some business location! The cost was reasonable considering it is all-inclusive of food, entrance fees and transport as necessary, while extra maps, notes and suggestions for the remainder of our time were very helpful.If we return to Budapest we would include another Budapest Locals tour (or 2) at the top of the to-do list. Thanks again Gaby for such an enjoyable and memorable day!"

She is not able to take credit cards, so make sure you have cash (We paid in Euros but she's happy to take Florint.) We were having a three-day visit to Budpest, so I contacted Budpest Locals to arrange a full day tour - \"Budapest Insider\" a full day - or 8 hours. As this is a private tour, we were able to customise the itinterary and Anita gave us a number of options. We exchanged a few emails before we arrived and Anita was able to suggest a few things to the day we arrived and when to plan to visit the spa Szechenyi Baths.Anita met us at our hotel and was very friendly, very informative and very very knowledgable about her city. The tour price included entrance tickets (where required), lunch and also one-day travel passes on public transport. After being shown around by Anita, we were quite confident to travel around on public transport ourselves for the rest of the trip.We were shown around most of the \"top 10\" places from our guidebook. Walking or taking the train as necessary. We were also taken to local cafes where we tried out local food (that we would probably not have dared to pick ourselves.) We finished off in a \"ruin bar.\" Anita had also recommended a river cruise for the previous evening, but as we hadn't gone, she booked us on the cruise that evening - another great recommendation."

Being a Saturday the crowded market would have been really hard to navigate,but she found us seats and went about getting us food and beers! We wrapped up our leftovers to take home.We went to another location for wine tasting, and also to an amazing local bakery where we were able to sample a platter of cakes and pastries (my personal favorites). Our last stop was one of the ruin bars in the Jewish district where we toasted with a shot of Palinka. This was my third trip to Budapest and we were having dinner with some of my relatives (my mother was Hungarian),that evening. Anita went over the menu with my husband,since this was his first experience and told him what would be a good choice.This is the way I like to see a city and get a personal touch and feel of the people. Anita was wonderful and helpful in giving us information about the city and history about the areas as well. Plus getting to taste local foods is always a plus.

She picked us ( 2 adults in their 50s and 4 in their 20s-30s) up at our hotel to show us her city and provided a wonderful, very large, cross section of Hungarian food. Along the way to restaurants, a ruin pub, and the market, she described the history, political and cultural changes ( so many!) of her city and country. One of the nicest parts was that she was honest - she expressed her opinions in a humorous yet straightforward manner and used personal anecdotes - very unusual and appreciated in a tour guide. We only want to return to Budapest to find out and explore more. She showed us how to manage the subway system, gave us sound advice on the baths and other activities, and answered the myriad of questions we threw at her. She also has been available to us for questions since the tour ended. Wonderful start to our Danube vacation."

She picked us up from our hotel and as we were doing another tour with our river boat cruise, we asked her to take us to the attractions that we would not be visiting on our other tour. She was able to change our itinerary on the spot and we walked and used the local underground and trains to criss-cross Budapest. She has an amazing knowledge of her city and we conversed about many subjects regarding different sites; she a very comprehensive memory. She made sure she took us at our own pace and my favourite place was the local market and market hall where she fed us the local food and specialities.

I am not in the habit of writing reviews but when good things happen and you have an enjoyable experience I feel it is important to take the time to do so.My wife and I and another couple had arranged for a 3 day stay in Budapest prior to a Viking Cruise on the Danube. Looking to arrange a tour of the city we checked on Trip Advisor and found some good reviews of tours with Anita. After contacting Anita via email, she advised she could not do a tour herself but her colleague Gaby would be available. Arrangements were made for Gaby to meet us at our hotel and as arranged, Gaby was there to greet us. What followed was an awesome 4 hour tour of Budapest that Gaby customized to our requests and did so in such a friendly, informative and knowledgeable manner. Her love for such a great city was evident and only enhanced by the wonderful way she shared it with us. We hope she enjoyed it as much as we did. Thanks Gaby and cheers to our drink in Ruin Bar."

I had been in contact with Anita by email since I was a little concerned about the situation at the Keleti train station. I had also heard that sometimes it's hard to get a taxi from the station. Anita, who wasn't able to take us on our food tour, because she was already booked, arranged for Gaby to meet us at the train station on Saturday when we came in and get us a taxi. Our food tour wasn't until Monday, but there she was when we got off the train. It was such a relief to not have to worry about how we were going to get to the hotel. On Monday, Gaby met us at our hotel and whisked us away to a marvelous 5 1/2 hour food tour. We started with a tour of the market. Gaby purchased several items for us to taste. From there we went to a wine bar and had two delicious wines with a cheese plate. One white and one red. We also had 3 different pieces of cake at a pastry shop. Afterwards we went to the Jewish Quarter and a very interesting little place called a ruin bar where we had a shot of palinka. She also took us to see the Opera House and St. Stephen's Basilica. The whole time Gaby explained the history and customs everywhere we went. This was so much more than a food tour. I highly recommend Budapest Locals and Anita and Gaby. They will take care of you."

These ranged from langos (fried dough with cheese), to the Hungarian cake of the year to palinka (fruit brandy) not to mention cheeses, wines, sausages, goose and various pickled vegetables!

All was excellent and there was plenty of food, Gaby took care of everything and we did not have to worry about a thing, afterwards we went to a wine bar close by, had a cheese plate and some very nice local wines. From here we went to a ruin bar, that was so interesting and we would not have been able to find it ourselves. On the way we passed the Synagoge and had a great discussion about Jews in Budapest during the 2nd World War. Gaby was so patient with and had answers to all our million questions. This was the best part about the day, that we got a insider view on life in Budapest.

We only had a few hours before our ship sailed and we felt this was THE best use of our free time. Gabriella met us at the dock and we walked a couple of blocks to the Market. This is a 3-story marvel that is packed with vendors stalls, shoppers and tourists. We could have easily spent the entire tour there, but after sampling Langos, roasted goose, pickled garlic and Hungarian beer, we walked a short distance to a lovely little wine shop where we sampled \"Bulls Blood\" and a variety of cheeses. We were surprised at the differences in taste/texture of the goat cheese, in particular. Afterward, we should have walked to the next attraction, but in the interest of time, we took the tram to the Jewish Synagogue and on to one of the most interesting places we saw on our trip: a \"ruin bar\". Our tour of Budapest was very special to us as Gabriella shared with us a little history, stories about her family and gave us a flavor of what life is like in Hungary, She was a delightful companion and guide and we could have spent hours more sharing stories with her. Unfortunately, we had to cut our tour short and get back to the ship. We felt we had a true \"cultural immersion\" with Gabriella and were the envy of our shipmates when we shared our excursion experience over (a very light) dinner. We recommend skipping breakfast and lunch before taking this tour and, above all, pace yourself! The food is delicious, and portions are large. A follow-up email included Hungarian recipes and the name of the wines we had sampled. We plan to stay in touch with Anita and Gabriella in hopes we can show them around our part of the US one day!"

Next we were off to a wine tasting. Then to try cakes and lastly to a ruin bar in the Jewish quarter.

She provided me what would have been her usual comprehensive tour ( the history, the culture, the important sites, a perspective on how the history has impacted the people) and then went on to provide a culinary tour as well. We explored markets (and shopped), the local cuisine, stopped at typical restaurants, and sampled the wonderful \"street food.\" She also showed me how to be adept with the local transit system, and made specific suggestions catered to my interests for the day I would be on my own afterwards. Anita is incredibly knowledgable, organized, kind, patient, flexible, interesting and interested.

That sounds boring, but it absolutely was NOT. In addition, we saw beautiful architecture, including the most incredible coffee shop which was formerly a ballroom, parks and monuments that gave a very real appreciation of the city, and wonderful, views! We saw breathtaking views from the copula of St. Stephan's church, and marveled at the cleanliness and efficiency of the underground metro. We tasted several marvelous versions of strudel, learned about the different ways to use Hungarian paparikas, and sampled a huge array of pickles, sausages, and even goose. We were very surprised when Anita purchased all the food we ate over the course of the day saying \"it's included in your tour.\" Our visit to the market was a highlight, but I have to say that the entire day was spectacular.

Her knowledge of the both sides of the city, historical information, and Hungarian culinary knowledge was superb. When we told her that we were from Cleveland, Ohio, she even informed us that many Hungarians had immigrated to Cleveland during the communist regime era. She took us to many sights (Heros park, the zoo and public thermal swimming pool, the market where we sampled meats and turo rudi, even a metro station which was so immaculate!) We drove down famous streets to admire Hungarian architecture. Our favorite stop was Castle Hill which where we enjoyed the view of the Danube River, Parliament and the wonderfully preserved medieval town. When our tour concluded, we said goodbyes to Anita in the shopping district and she recommended some great restaurants for lunch. Afterwards, our driver took us back to our hotel in Vienna.

Culinary exploration often defines a city for me and our Budapest experience fast-tracked this glorious Eastern European capital to my list of fave global foodie destinations. Anita is a fantastic guide - unbelievably knowledgeable (of course), passionate about sharing culinary tips and advice, and just a great person to hang out with - and eat with (although we definitely did most of the eating!). I'm used to thee-hour whirlwind tours, which are fab but this was a marathon of edible discovery and the absolute highlight of our fur-day sojourn in the city. Anita, thank you thank you thank you!"

Although my husband grew up in Budapest, he decided to hire professional tour guides to show us his homeland and to give us richer explanations of what we were seeing. Anita was our favorite. She arrived and was ready to go with sites planned out that would interest all of us. She was prepared with interesting games, pictures and questions. She presented the horrific history of Hungary\u2019s past in the most sensitive manner that enabled us to reflect and remember, but still see the beauty of the country today. I am pretty sure that we\u2019ll make future visits to Hungary and when we do, Anita will be the first and only tour guide we contact.--From our Daugther: \u201cI\u2019m 7 years old and I think Miss Anita was fun, nice, smart and caring. Miss Anita made it the best trip ever. Thank you Miss Anita.\u201d"

You see the city through their eyes. We found a perfect guide when we chose Anita Barda. My husband and I were wrapping up a Vikings River Cruise by spending 2 days on our own in Budapest. What a treat having a personal guide! Anita was interesting, knowledgeable, and fun. We mixed the tour between food and history. She took us to the market and purchased samples of local fare....as well, as helping us buy paprika to make goulash soup at home. (She even emailed the recipes.) Everything she chose for us to see was fun. We'd seen many of the sights (Castle Hill, Heroes Square, etc.) with Viking. We saw the Market, Ruined Bars (witnessed a hail storm), had strudel, and wine all covered in the cost of the tour. One of the nicest things she did was plan our itinerary of the next day....down to buying a 24 hour Metro ticket for us and showing us how to use the transit system. She prepared us for a day on our own. You really got two tours for the price of one. Last but not least we feel we made a friend with Anita. She is a very caring and friendly person. Her rates were very competitive! WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANITA BARDA!"

We were in Budapest for five days and for me, the highlight of the trip was the tour with Anita. The entire experience was fantastic! We started the day at the Strudel House sampling different flavours, followed by a trip to the local market where Anita talked about the history of the place, the products sold inside by locals. Then she bought us lunch purchased from the different stalls - the food were all fresh and delicious! The tour started at 9:30 and we finished at 5:00 PM. We had plenty of food to eat, tasted some great wines from different regions in Budapest and ended the tour with shots of locally produced schnapps at the Ruin Bars which was the perfect end to our day. The entire tour will satisfy the history buffs since Anita is very knowledgeable and the foodies will be delighted with this tour. Great value for money coupled with Anita's charming personality. This is one tour that you should not miss when in Budapest!"

We couldn\u2019t have chosen a better ambassador for the city than Anita! I had read review after review on TA to find the person that best fit what we were looking for; many thanks to the TA community for so many honest and accurate reviews!We booked Anita\u2019s 8 hour tour, which, due to scheduling issues, was split into 2 days (this was, in hindsight, a wonderful solution, since we were fresher the second day). After she bought the public transport tickets (and explained the system), we started with a tour of the market, which is unlike anything I\u2019d seen in size, scope or variety. She bought us many different types of food to sample, which made us more comfortable later understanding the different food choices. From there, we headed back to the Jewish quarter, near our apartment, to wind up Day 1.On the second day, we covered everything else in the city. She explained the history of the city/country, had a very interesting example of the language, gave insight into the days of Communist rule\u2026.all while travelling to the various landmarks around Budapest. We had a tasty strudel stop, combined with a wine tasting, which provided a nice break. Anita was very accommodating with our preferences, as well as adaptable when the tour couldn\u2019t proceed as she wanted due to the shutdown of major transportation routes in the city for the Gay Pride parade. But that didn\u2019t affect our enjoyment of the tour, and in fact, added a different dimension that we couldn\u2019t possibly have planned!Anita\u2019s written and spoken English are fantastic, and she was very responsive on email. Anita clearly has a passion for her city, her profession, and for people. Post tour, she forwarded me some Hungarian recipes that I look forward to trying. She was most definitely the highlight of our trip to Budapest!"

She taught us how to manage the mass transit system, informed us of great restaurants, showed us incredible sights and taught us some basic phrases in Hungarian that would allow us to feel and be more pleasant tourist among the locals.

We learned so much about the rich culture, history, politics and people of Hungary.

In three words: It Was Incredible! I learned more in her 1 tour than any of the 3 I took in Budapest; and, as a matter of fact, more than I learned in my entire 15 day visit to 6 countries in Central Europe.Anita is quite knowledgable, engaging, humorous, forthright and extraordinarily well-spoken. I have read a considerable amount of literature about the Holocast (by the way, I am not Jewish), but I never understood it from the deep human perspective as viscerally as I did after Anita's trek through the Jewish Ghetto of Budapest. I still remember, vividly, the stories she related of the human beings that suffered under this horrendous and oppressive occupation by the Nazis.There were many light moments as well. We sampled the coffees and pastries at a wonderful coffee house, we visited the Opera House and we learned an incredible amount about the people and the history of this fascinating city. I came away with a much deeper understanding, and appreciation, of the city and its people than anything I experienced on the \"drive by\" City Bus Tour.I can not recommend Anita's Walking Tour any more highly.

It is a tremendous value. Everything was included .... All the food and drinks ... even a 24 hour metro pass. It's truly a hassle free, no pressure tour. Anita is so welcoming and engaging that you really feel that you're just hanging out with a good friend who is showing you her city. She's very good at what she does. When walking or riding between stops she easily chats about some of the history and what we were going past. Just the right amount of information and not at all a boring memorized recitation of facts. So, not only did we get a food tour, we also got a mini city tour. Also along the way she writes things on her map for you to do and see in the rest of your trip and willingly answered my endless questions. As she got to know us a little bit she even made some restaurant recommendations that are probably not in any guide book. I wish I could give this tour more than 5 stars. If you have the chance, book a tour with Anita. It really was a highlight of our trip. I certainly hope we are fortunate enough to participate in another of her tours in the near future."

Not only is Anita deeply knowledgeable about the city (or cities) and related history, but she is pleasant, engaging and quite lovely. The information she imparted was interesting and relevant. Anita is a chef as well and we are looking forward to trying some recipes she emailed after we returned home.~RThomson"

I actually almost canceled the tour, since we had purchased hop on hop off bus tour passes and I wasn't wanting to spend the additional money for another tour. I am so glad I didn't cancel. Anita picked up our family of five (two adults and three children ages 12, 10 & 7 years old) at our hotel at 9:30 am. She did not drop us off back at our hotel until 6pm. We saw everything that I had wanted to see in Budapest plus more. She was very willing to adapt the tour to our families wants and needs. She went out of her way to include the children and make sure that they were ok with how everything was going. I highly recommend booking a tour with her."

The Strudel House stop was a big hit with the group and the entire stop was included in the price. Anita even brought traditional chocolate treats for us to try.

But most of all, we were really touched about her kindness and thoughtfulness when my daughter got sore feet, Anita asked her colleague to bring her own comfortable shoes to my daughter \u2013 just like a big sister, such a great person that my daughter still talks about her heartily! We enjoyed our stay in Budapest very much thanks to Anita, she made Budapest even more beautiful with its great hospitality, kindness, and warm-heart!

Budapest was the next stop on our map and let me tell you, that was one amazing pick of a city we did there. We had perfectly warm weather where we enjoyed walking with a cold drink in our hands for hours while we discovered the beautiful city and its remarkable ties to history. That was indeed with the help of our great local guide Anita. She spoke English fluently and organised her descriptions of the different local places and buildings very well. She knew Budapest to its heart and it really felt like a book was read out loud. Anita was also very friendly, kind and she answered our questions with pleasure. Never has a city given out such a soothing vibe to me. Great weather, beautiful architecture, nice locals and delicious food! But that only comes as a package if you get to know the city really well. Me and my family have Anita to thank that for. We will come back to Budapest for a second visit for sure!"

We were lucky to have found one of the best private guides we've ever had the pleasure of using in the many years we've been cruising. Emily is such a knowledgeable and personable person, we felt like we were being shown around by a trusted friend. She included in the itineraries interesting places that are off the beaten path, not normally shown by other guides, but we're so glad she did! Her husband drives a most comfortable van, and provided prompt and efficient transfer for us and all our luggage from the airport to our hotel, then a transfer to the river boat when it was time to join the cruise. Emily was just fabulous as a guide for three tours we arranged with her. These included a Jewish Heritage tour, a nighttime folklore dinner show (which was so much fun, and such great food!) followed by a nighttime \"lights of the city\" tour, then a full day Danube Bend tour. Emily is also totally flexible and patient, waiting for us when we wanted to linger, and taking us to a bake shop for that wonderful Rachel's Flodni, a delicious pastry that we had been advised to make sure we try when in Budapest. We have been recommending Emily to all our friends, and have no hesitation in recommending her on this board.Sam & Eileen"

Emily is a lovely, clever, informative lady who enabled us to have the best time. She collected us from our hotel and tailored our tour so that the particular things we wanted to see were included, she pre booked tickets to Parliament, the river cruise and Gellert Spa so we did not have to queue. She gave us lots of information about the city and its history and culture it was fabulous. We then all went to Vienna, I had asked Emily to find us a typically Austrian restaurant for lunch as it was my birthday and she found a great one. Vienna was wonderful, she drove us around first so we could take pictures then we stopped for a short tour seeing hidden gems before going to the Palace. She also took us to a fabulous cafe for coffee and strudel. We would highly recommend Emily to get the most out of your trip she will happily tailor your tour to your interests. Thank you Emily for giving us the best time."

She also showed us a couple neat hidden gems and shared some interesting tidbits along the way. She knows her stuff!When I travel with my family, I prefer a small group and a local guide, and Emily delivered! Superb job! "

Our family of 4 Adults and 2 Children enjoyed every one of the venues that Emily shared with us about her city of Budapest. We were going on a river boat cruise with Tauck Bridges and knew we would not have time to see the city as we would like to so we contacted Emily and she suggested how we should spend our one day before the River boat cruise. We would highly recommend Emily with a 5 star rating."

We choose to see Hungry's countryside and arts. Herend is amazing hand painted porcelain. We started out by drinking coffee from the porcelain then we went into the museum and had a tour. The drive to Herend is quite long but Emily filled the time with her amazing knowledge of Hungarian history. She is a professor at one of Budapest's universities. After Herend, we went for lunch on I the peninsula of Tihany. We had amazing food. We then walked to Lake Balaton to take photos. I would say Emily is a wonderful guide who knows so much."

We booked her months in advance and kept in contact with her, discussing sites and interests we wanted to see/do. She customized a complete tour for us to include EVERYTHING on our list plus more! She even was able to pick us up at the airport and take us back for a small fee.She was outstanding! Her English was perfect and her knowledge of Budapest and it's rich history was taught to us when we visited each site. She went into just the right amount of detail in explaining the site, building or landmark. She knew just where to go and was very 'creative' in her abilities to get us into places most tourists would never know about. She took us around in her Mercedes Mini-van and some parts by foot, depending on what we wanted to see. We enjoyed our tour with her so much, we hired her for another half-day so we could do/see even more sites. If you don't get her for your visit to Budapest, you'll miss most of what the city has to offer. She also gave us recommendations for places to eat and things to do on our own time, once done with her tour. If she did not have the answer for something we wanted, she would contact her 'tour guide friends' who would quickly respond with the answers so we never needed for anything. Absolutely amazing. I could not recommend her more - she was the BEST guide we have ever had! A+++++++++"

She knows so much, and freely shares her knowledge and time! Our days were long and packed full of things to do. Day one was a tour of the city sights, and day two was the Danube Bend tour. We especially enjoyed wandering around the artists' town shopping! Tonight we will have one last trip with Emily, to experience a local gypsy dinner and show - I am sure it will be fun. By the way, Emily gladly suggested restaurants for us in advance, and then made all the reservations. So helpful, as the best ones get booked up well in advance!!"

Then she took us on a private tour of Parliament, the Jewish protest memorial & St Stephen's Basilica including a viewing of the mummified hand which was requested by someone in our group. She didn't stop with the information, or taking us to eat ice cream hand dipped and shaped in a rose, or the quirky ruin bar. After 4 hours she dropped us off at the train station and helped us with our luggage to locate the platform and train that we were booked on. She then made sure our other friends were also on the way to meet us on the train. We were very impressed with Emily's great professional and friendly service.

On the way there, we made a short detour to Bratislava for a quick visit to the city's historic town centre and to see a pretty blue church. Very smooth journey. The same evening, Emily joined us for a night tour of the city, for fabulous night views of the Danube, and buildings along the Danube on both the Buda and Pest side of the city. Subsequently, I had a day and a half of tours with Emily to cover sights in Pest that were some distance from where I was based and to places where only a local would know. On all tours, Emily was very patient with my frequent stops to take pictures, stops for souvenirs and to mail postcards. She has a great love for her city and will keep you informed of its history and present situation. Where buildings or monuments have symbolic figures/symbolism on them, she will explain them to you - something you will rarely if ever find in even the best of guide books. Emily has a great personality and you will feel completely at ease during tours."

We are a family of four adults and Emily's van was very spacious and comfortable.For the 4 hour Art Nouveau/Parliament tour, we started in the morning. Besides getting an overview of the center of Budapest (this was our first full day in the city), we saw most of the notable Art Nouveau buildings. Several times we took short walks to take a closer look at the Museum of Applied Arts, the Geological Institute of Budapest, the Royal Postal Savings Bank, etc. To break up the Art Nouveau with some gothic architecture, we went on an hour-long tour of the beautifully gilded Parliament building. It was an hour well-spent. Emily dropped us off at the Great Market Hall where she helped us buy some foie gras and gave us tips on what to buy where.Our next trip with Emily was our transfer from Budapest to Vienna. With suitcases all safely loaded, we had a nice drive to the border where we had a rest stop. We spent 3 hours driving and walking around Vienna's old center to get a sense of the city. The stop at Hundertwasser house was a highlight. It was freezing, but we persevered. Emily took us into the Cathedral, which is free to see inside (up to a point) and gave us some background on the massive palaces, like the Hofburg and the Opera House. Due to time constraints, some of the more out of the way points of interest, we checked out later by ourselves.Emily was a very pleasant and cordial guide. Kusunum, Emily, for getting us safely to Vienna!"

Emily planned her tour to coordinate with the additional 2 days we were going to be in Budapest. She recommended and included the guided tour of the Parliament which was very worthwhile. The following day when our Tauck tour began my husband and I realized that had we not taken the 5 hour tour with Emily we would have missed out on several important sights. She took us to not only the highlights of the city but to some lesser known places such as a ruin bar in the Jewish section, a Monument to the Jewish Genocide which had been erected just this past year, and a restaurant where you can see how strudel is made. Upon her recommendation we had dinner at this restaurant the next evening. Our tour was a combination of driving and walking and Emily always found a parking spot!

We had never hired a guide before and WHAT A GREAT IDEA IT WAS TO HIRE EMILY ! Emily picked us up promptly at 10am at our B&B and gave us a thorough and informative tour of the city. We chose the 4 hour driving and walking tour of the main sights in Budapest w a special request to see 2 of the bath houses! The tour was not rushed, we had plenty of time to wander, ask questions and take pictures! And we saw the entire city!! And to our special delight Emily's husband Gabrielle drove and they brought baby Laura along so it felt like we were \"family!\" Emily is very intelligent, friendly & sweet and she shared her special knowledge of Budapest's architecture, history, Communism, people, language, and stories with us! Emily also teaches at the University and is a wife and mother! She is very professional and yet it was like we were running around the city with a good friend! She never rushed us. It was 'our' tour!! We learned so much and after the tour we were able to choose what sights to revisit in the next few days in Budapest and what other things we wanted to do. We chose to go to the baths one day , to get massages and facials, to go to the central market and to do a dinner opera and folk dance cruise on the Danube River. We enjoyed Emily so much we hired her to drive us to Vienna ( our next destination) and to give us a 3-4 hour tour of Vienna! This was such a great idea since we were leaving Budapest during the refugee crisis and the trains were backed up and booked solid! Having a private driver made life easy. Cars were being stopped and searched at the border of Budapest and Austria and there was a 3-4 hour back up of traffic. Luckily Emily knew the back roads and avoided the back up . We made it to Vienna, had a lovely tour of the city and even stopped for lunch. If you want a tour guide, call Emily. She is a lovely person and will show you all the sights and she will fill your head w great stories and the fascinating history of Budapest! Thank you Emily from Patti, John and Sasha!!"

Fortunately, Emily was willing to drive us even though, again, it was very last-minute and she didn't have day-care for her baby. We did not have lodging for an extra day in Budapest, and we had prepaid for our lodging in Vienna, so Emily really save us. She drove us to Vienna with her baby, giving us a history lesson the whole way. We feel fortunate to have found Emily and highly recommend her as a tour guide."

I think it would have been far better to have done this first because she gives you such good insights on what is special about the city. Emily is interesting, very knowledgeable and friendly. I don't think you can go wrong here. We were lucky that she was available on one days notice.

A native of the city and a college professor, she showed us all the important places and those that few get to see, while putting each in historical and contemporary perspective. Budapest is a gorgeous city with an ugly past and a political present that could undo much of what\u2019s currently good. Emily showed us the new monument in Szabads\u00e1g square, erected in the middle of one dark night, which many commentators see as an attempt to sugar-coat (if not completely rewrite) the part Hungary\u2019s leaders played in the Nazi take-over of the country. Around the bronze and granite monument, families and friends of Nazi victims have laid out photos and personal effects of some of those who lost so much to the Nazis and to those who invited them into Hungary. After a day of seeing Parliament, Matthias Church, the New York Caf\u00e9, two beautiful spas, and even a ruin pub, Emily made sure that we understood the potential, at least, of a dark side of her well-loved country that could rise again if people choose not to be vigilant. Excuse me. I don\u2019t want to give the impression that the day dwelt in darkness or even in history lessons. Such isn\u2019t at all the case with this fascinating and entertaining young woman. We had an amazing day, filled with laughter and unexpected joy in a city full of people who do such things as spend the day playing chess while sitting in a hot-spring-fed spa pool. We just got the whole story of Budapest and came away aware that there\u2019s so much more to it than the shining lights of Castle Hill and Parliament and the connecting bridges, as beautiful as they all are on a warm day and night in August."

We also hired her to transfer us to Vienna and give us a tour of Vienna too. She gave us a great day tour of Vienna and dropped us off at our hotel. Our hotel in Vienna was a little hard to find and she came in with us to make sure we were in the right place. Just like family.

Emily and her husband collected us from our hotel in an air conditioned spotless people carrier and took us on a tour of Budapest at night. Her knowledge of the city and of Hungarian history made my stay in Budapest. It gave me a huge (and unexpected) interest in Hungarian history which made the trip even more poignant for me. Her pride in her country was evident. She's lovely, professional and easy to be with. I don't think I could recommend this trip enough tbhAfter the trip not only had we seen the sights but we had personal recommendations for ice cream shops, trams, other places to visit and were fully orientated geographically so that we could explore the city easily.I know I would not have seen as much and from such great vantage points as I did on this tour. I have one regret: I went on the tour after a long hot journey stood on a train, poor sleep the night before and the tour was so enthralling that when it came to an end I was too dozy to get money ready. I handed over the due amount but would have tipped far more because we all enjoyed it so much. For this omission I feel huge regret because I'd really like her to know how much we loved it. I spent a lot of the next day trying to work out how I could get money to her. So Emily, if you're reading this I'm so sorry I didn't, because it was the highlight of my trip to Budapest.I will be back one day and hope to rectify it then with another tour!"

The first day we spent over 7 hours covering all of the sights of budapest. I cant think of a single sight we didnt see. The pace was relaxed and we travelled between each attraction in an air conditioned van which was much needed in the 34 degree heat!Emily spoke perfect English and we enjoyed spending time in her company. The next day she collected us from our apartment with her husband Gabriel who drove us. We also got to meet her beautuful baby Laura who came along for the day. This day we opted for the Danube bend tour and again the itinerary was well out together and we loved seeing more of this beautiful country. If you have a budget for this type of tour I cannot recommend Emily enough. I will definitely book her again the next time we come to Budapest."

Emily not only gave us a historical perspective but helped us with our camera exposures so our photographs were very professional! Emily's English is impeccable. She speaks six languages and is an academician. She is truly professional, always on time and even puts up with shopaholics, always putting her client's needs first. When she was unavailable, she was able to provide an equally talented colleague and even found a guide for us in another city that was also excellent. We spent our days not only seeing the sights with Emily but discussing history, politics, culture, and \"connecting'\" as friends, She suggested we do the Sechenyi baths which were quite an experience and one that shouldn't be missed! All our tours involved some form of eating and there was never a disappointment regarding any of her suggestions. We did a walking tour of Budapest, went to the lovely town of Szentendre and went to Godollo Palace as well as the Lazar brothers ranch to see the horses perform. The ranch was my only dissapointment this trip as I thought the horse show considerably amateur in production and the experience very \"touristy\".. The horses were however beautiful as were the other animals on the ranch (especially the Hungarian Puli) and the country side was lovely to drive through.I would definitely recommend Emily as your guide in this beautiful city. She will extend herself for you and you will return home with a new friend as well as some lovely memories!!For Emily: I hope you and Laura are doing well. Kisses to her!!"

She then also drove us to the Children's railway in the Buda mountains where we rode a nice engine down and got off to a midway point (Janos hill) where got off, hiked a bit then hopped on an open ski lift ride down the town of Zugliget at the bottom of the Buda hills with fantastic views of the city from high above! She gave us very clear and specific instructions on how to wander the streets of outer Buda upon leaving us at the end of our tour and we thoroughly enjoyed seeing yet another part of Budapest where everyday folks live (Zugliget). Booking her from start to finish was easy and she always replied quickly to my queries, arrived on time and kept even the kids engaged all throughout the tour.

We had Emily as our tour guide and we were very impressed and pleased with her services. Emily had her colleague meet us at the airport and took us to our hotel. She recommended that we see Budapest by day and night which we did. This was a great recommendation because the city is magically transformed at night. After meeting Emily, we felt we were in good hands because it soon became obvious that she was very knowledgeable, warm, welcoming and loves her country. We had a four hour tour of the highlights of Budapest that afternoon during which time she took us to the main iconic spots both in Buda and in Pest. She was very versed in the social, historical and cultural importance of each location and she explained them in impeccable English. This enlightening tour ended at a relaxing riverside restaurant recommended by Emily along with some suggestions for local dishes to try. For the following day, she suggested a list of places (with directions), some that we had visited before, that we could tour at our leisure. This we found very useful and enjoyable. Emily was very flexible in accommodating any special requests that we had. For the night tour, we revisited the places we had been to during the day, along with some others that we requested, and were thrilled by how the city was transformed by lights. It is also beautiful during the \u201cblue light\u201d period.We found Emily to be very organized.

The price would have been the same had we done a bog standard tour. The tour date was changed a couple of times (due to our total ignorance - we booked our tour for the long weekend that celebrates Hungary's National Day), but despite it being a massive holiday, we had a great time, and no troubles with anything being closed. Emily constantly kept us up to date with any changes via email. Her knowledge and passion for her country is outstanding, and really shows when she is talking about places and history. She is a lecturer in wellness management, and speaks 6 languages fluently! I also must mention our driver, Stephen, who also spoke perfect English, and was most helpful and friendly. During our day tour, I felt like Emily made small changes as my Mum had problems doing a lot of walking (she very recently hurt her back) - but it never felt like we missed anything. We also felt that we were taken to a couple of places that the big tour companies might have missed.We highly recommend Emily, and all of the drivers she used for a truly wonderful experience!(We would also recommend the full day Danube Bend Tour too)"

We arrived in Budapest on a riverboat, and Emily had a driver meet us to take us to our hotel. Then we were off on a tour of the Jewish area followed by a tour of the interior of Parliament. Emily was extremely knowledgeable and eager to share her rich understanding of her amazing city. The next morning we headed out to tour the famous cafes and thermal baths. We were so impressed with Emily's ability to navigate the city and know just the right things to show us. The last day was just my husband and me. Emily picked us up in her car and we headed out of the city to Szentendre (St. Andrews), the town of artists. We spent a wonderful day walking around the small town, enjoying the history, artists, and shops. Emily seemed to know everyone! A highlight of our trip was watching Emily salsa dancing on a street corner 'meet up' of other dancers later that evening (we surprised her). She is not only an incredible tour guide, but also a phenomenal dancer. I most highly recommend Emily! After the time you spend with her you will know the city of Budapest inside and out, plus you will feel like you have a new friend."

Emily was charming, knowledgeable, punctual, professional, speaks six languages, born and raised in Budapest, knew everything about its history and even teaches other tour guides.

She picked us up in her car at our apartment exactly at our scheduled time. The first day was a combination of driving in the city and walking, depending on the location. The second day was out of town so more driving but plenty of walking to stretch our legs at the lake and the abbey. She was very thorough with explanations and left us with things to do circled on our map for the following days that we were on our own. We even had a little quiz at the end of our second day and she was such a good teacher that we passed with no problem! You will be very happy with the quality of your tour if you book with Emily!"

(In addition to her college level teaching, she recently has been awarded a postion in Germany to continue her Doctor of Philosophy requirements). She expressed her multi-lingual skills as she graciously aided a Spanish group at the Parliament ticket office. Emily was warmly greeted by a colleague or friend at literally every stop of the day making us feel as if we were touring with a \"rock star\". Though we didn't get to experience first hand, Emily loves dancing and must know every club dancer in Budapest--I am unaware if she offers a \"dance club\" tour. Several of the police or other attendants encountered seemed to know Emily and/or let her do whatever she desired in respect to getting around a barricade, double parking, etc., which proved helpful on several occasions.

Prior to our trip, I made a lot of enquiries from her, asked her for help to secure bookings for concerts and restaurant reservations, and she was always responsive and provided good suggestions. We did a 3 hour afternoon tour of the city and were very pleased that we covered not only the main sights, but she also brought us to other interesting places not covered in the usual itinerary. She took us on a tour of Parliament, a really worthwhile visit with beautiful architecture. We highly recommend her if you ever visit Budapest. She is highly experienced, and even teaches tourism at one of the local institutions. In addition, she was accomodating, accepting payment in US$ at a fair market exchange rate when I ran out of Euros. Thank you Emily for making our visit a pleasant and memorable one. Pat"

It was one of the best decisions that I made for the trip. There was just my husband and myself and Emily made sure that we saw places all over the city. She ordered tickets for us for the tour of the Parliament building which my husband says is the most beautiful building he has ever seen. His expertise is commercial construction. I talked to many others on our cruise and no one else had the privilege to tour the Parliament building. I could go on and on. We went to the top of Liberty Hill and this is the only place where you can get pictures of both Buda and Pest and Margaret Island in the center of the river. We went inside the Szechenyl Spa and pools. We loved the time we spent with Emily. Her knowledge and enthusiasm make her the perfect choice to make the most of the time you have in Budapest. We love, love, love Budapest and we hope to travel back there someday."

It included transportation to and from the Hungaroring race track for Forumula 1 practice and qualifying. Emily was a sport to do this and had a great attitude about providing the experience on a hot and crowded day. We let Emily choose the Budapest sites to see and we enjoyed our day tremendously. My son is a history and architecture buff and Emily took extra care to show and discuss various sites. In addition to the tour we had a wonderful coffee desert at the New Your Cafe and outdoor dinner by the Danube. We enjoyed our day tremendously. Emily is a wonderful host."

The first was a half day driving/walking tour of Budapest and the second was a full day one to the countryside. Our half day tour included a tour of the Parliament and the full day tour ended with a ferry ride down the Danube. Both tours were very enjoyable. Emily is a very engaging guide who is extremely knowledgeable about Budapest and about Hungarian history. On the half day tour we saw all of the major sites in Budapest and stopped at numerous ones to get out of the car (which was of a type like a Toyota Corolla) and have walk around to see them close up. This was a very efficient way of seeing everything. Throughout the tour Emily explained everything that we were seeing along with the historical background. If you are looking for a great overview of Budapest, I would highly recommend this tour. The full day tour of the countryside was outstanding. We saw a number of places that you would just not see if you were travelling alone or on an organised tour. For example, we went to a small university with amazing architecture. We also went to more conventional sites such as the largest basilica in Hungary and the artists\u2019 town. All the while we had interesting conversation and commentary with Emily. In the artists\u2019 town she was able to arrange a demonstration of how some of the handcrafts are produced. At the end of the tour she got us on to the ferry to return to Budapest. Throughout both tours Emily was informative and interesting. I would highly recommend her if you are coming to Budapest.We also arranged our transfer from the train station and then to the airport through Emily. These both worked very well.The rates for the tour and transfers was much less than those I saw advertised by larger firms."

She picked us up on time from the train station (though we had to inform her last minute we were delayed by 2 hrs, as we missed the train from Vienna).She is a very sincere, friendly and nice person. Thoughout our time with her, she took special effort to watch out for my mum (in her 70s), and was always flexible in making impromtu changes along the way. Emily made reservations for our dinner boat cruise, and helped called the boat company to let us board direct at the pier when we were running late. She checked out whether places and restaurants we wished to visit were open (as it was the Easter weekend), and gave us good advice on how best to plan our iternary.Emily places a big emphasis on ensuring her guests are well taken care of, not hesitating to go the extra mile many a times.For example, she instructed the Borsso Restaurant waiter to help us book a cab, after we had dinner there one evening. And she accompanied us to the train ticket office to buy our return tickets -who was a great help as the ticket officer wasnt proficient in English. In fact, she ensured we got onto the right train at the right platform, before she left.As a guide, Emily is very knowledgeable about the history and meaning of the sights we went to. One of the main reasons we chose Emily is because she is the official guide to the Parliament House. The Parliament House is magnificant externally and especially internally - more beautiful than many of the palaces we visited during our 17 days Europe trip and strongly recommended for any visitor to Budapest. In 1.5 days, we covered the Parliament House, Heroes Square, St Stephen's Cathedral, Great Synagogue, Fisherman Bastion n Castle Hill, Gellert and the other famous thermal baths, Szentendre, and other interesting sights.We are very glad to have Emily as our private guide for Budapest- she is like an old friend showing us around the city, not a commercial guide. We would strongly recomnend Emily as the private guide to go with, for any visitor to Hungary. She is really the Best - Go with her! "

My partner and I were most fortunate to discover the glowing reviews of Emily's tour guide service on TripAdvisor prior to taking my 85-year-old mother to Hungary. We had hoped to visit three small villages several hours from Budapest and Emily was very accommodating. Without her, we would never have been able to walk the streets of our ancestors. Emily is a wealth of knowledge - she is a wonderful tour guide, historian, and photographer all wrapped up in one genuinely kind person. Our trip to the Great Plains region was so enjoyable that we met with Emily on the next two days for a night tour of Budapest and a guided tour of the Parliament Building plus several other key spots, respectively. We had an amazing time in Hungary thanks to Emily. My family said they have not ever seen my mom so excited as she is when she talks about her trip, but mostly about the tours Emily took us on. It was a trip of a lifetime! The trip has prompted me to start doing more family research again, and Emily even helped to coordinate local genealogical research for me prior to and after our trip.We cannot recommend her highly enough. Thanks for everything, Emily."

We knew he lived in a small town in Hungary called Somberek but knew little if anything about his family. We saw the reviews about Emily and contacted her and set up a trip to Somerek, which is almost to the Croatian border. When we met Emily she immediately informed us she had contacted the Catholic Church in Somberek and had found the names of my Grandfather's 2 brothers and 2 sisters. We were blown away. That was more information in our first 5 minutes than we had learned in 5 years. We piled into Emily's car and headed off to Somberek. There are a lot of details, but the highlights were that Emily found another family in Somberek (population about 200) named Bacher who ended up putting us in touch with another lady who is kind of the town historian. We all (Emily, my wife and I, the recently acquainted Bacher family and the town historian) went to the graveyard and found several interesting grave markers including one that we think belonged to my Great Grandfather. Unfortunately the stones used for the head stones were badly eroded over time. The highlight of the visit, other than meeting what probably are some distant cousins, was to visit a memorial in Somberek to World War I casualties in the center of town. We found our Grandfather's brother listed on the memorial. The next day Emily took us on a private tour of Budapest. Many of the other reviews covered this part of her services so I will not be redundant except to say it was wonderful. If there were a way to give a 7 star rating she would have one. Thanks Emily and sorry about your car."

I've never used a private guide before and was a bit skeptical about value for money, but in comparison to group tours, it was completely worth the expense. Emily also got us tickets for the Parliament tour which was absolutely incredible and took us around to various sites in her car so we could get an idea of both the city's history and attractions, and some ideas for our own adventures later. Over a snack at the amazing New York Caf\u00e9, where she got one of the staff to show us around the hotel a bit more, she produced a map and highlighted some other interesting places, and vouchers which save time at the baths and boat tours, both of which we have done.So, if you're staying a short time in Budapest as we are, and want to see a lot in a day to help use your time wisely, I can't recommend a private guide like Emily strongly enough."

He even took great effort in assisting us purchase tickets for the Parliament building by recruiting the some local store keepers (and their laptops).We started in, Szentendre, a charming little town on the banks of the Danube with lots of crafts and a museum containing more impressive sculptures made of Marzipan then you possibly could imagine. Then we moved on to the River Bend itself from an elevated view near the fort (which we opted to not enter). After a small history lesson, we grabbed lunch on the side of Danube. This restaurant served the most delicious grilled Trout! After some well deserved rest, sipping beer and watching a tributary flow just below us from our lunch table, it was on to our next stop. Off the beaten path, Andras shared a hidden spot with us that took us right to the river's edge. It included a short walk through the woods which was enjoyable as well. Finally we made it to a restored mansion for a strawberry wine and homemade dessert tasting. The mansion's owner was a charismatic, jovial guy who was also a friend of Andras. We quickly felt like part of their crew as we hiked up the back yard to the \"tree house\", sharing stories and learning about the walnut trees. We concluded with the wine and dessert tasting and a tour of the house, It was 7:30pm by the time we made it back to our hotel, pleasantly exhausted from the great tour!"

We arrived in Budapest a day prior to our European River Cruise so I wanted a structured day of sightseeing - and we had an absolute fantastic day. WE had Bal\u00e1zs as our all day tour guide. He arrived on time, with great transportation and brought his knowledge, personality and love of Budapest with him. I cannot say enough kind things - we did and saw so much - all at a nice quiet pace (which we wanted so my parents)- saw so many interesting hidden gems. We shared lunch together and I left the day wishing I could spend more time in Budapest. This was my best day of our 12 day European tour ... to Bal\u00e1zs -- thank you thank you thank you! You are so kind + patient and my family loved spending the day with you!!"

We attracted a lot of attention from locals and tourists. Come to find out, these communist cars are quite a collectors item in Hungary. Bal\u00e1zs was an amazing guide with a lot of knowledge. We saw some of the major sites, but he also took us to some \"hidden gems\". Then we went to his parents house for a typical Hungarian meal. Warning: go hungry! His mother is an amazing cook and the food just keeps coming. You don't want to miss a thing! The next day, Bal\u00e1zs to us to Lake Balaton and a winery. It was beautiful! It was great to experience both the city and the countryside. And- enjoy wonderful wines with excellent food.Our experience with My Personal Budapest was excellent. I would highly recommend their \"tours\" (experience)!"

We travel to learn about how connected we all really are. How history changes us all in different ways but ultimately still connected just in a different path of the same branch, from the very same story... In the end, we travel to find ourselves, it's really the story of our lives unfolding. So do all the touristy things for a day or two, then go find My Personal Budapest Tours and get the real story if you care and are hungry for more than just an impersonal tour.We did the Hungarian Soul Tour with Andras and the half day wine tour with Balazs. They were both incredible and we loved every minute of their passion and love for their country. We were struck by how passionate, and soulful the Hungarian people are. It took our breath away even more than the beauty of Budapest and it's top 5 of the most beautiful cities I've ever had the privilege to visit. The only other country we have really experienced that kind of passion is probably Ireland. The Hungarians really have soul. They are a breath of fresh air. We don't normally say for sure that we will go back to a country in the near future, but Hungary is an exception, it draws you back, it stays with you.What I love about Andras and his team, is that they spell out exactly what to expect in their tours, they are organized and professional but still free spirited. I won't explain the tours we did because you can find everything you need on the website. It was incredible. Indescribable beauty, great company, insightful real in-depth conversations, wonderful new friends, fantastic food and wine. What more can you ask for in life? Thank you Balazs, thank you Andras and please tell your mom and dad that we loved their warmth and hospitality. I shall be attempting to make that dish soon that your mom made us. I'm armed with her paprika... We will be back, God willing and when we do, we'll be connected to My Personal Budapest Tours again..."

            "review": "A Commi/Capitalist drive through Budapest. This is one of the more memorable things we've done. A little background: The Trabant is a one of the communist cars that was poorly designed, poorly engineered and assembled, yet still had a 10-year waiting list due to soviet \u201cefficiency\u201d. It would be hard to overstate what a P.O.S. this car is. My lawn tractor makes more power than the Trabant\u2019s 2-stroke motor and my college kid's handmade club race car is more refined. The body panels, hood and roof are all made from Soviet plastic and I can\u2019t imagine a worse production car. That said, I absolutely LOVED cruising around Budapest in the Trabant!Budapest is an interesting mix of old-world style and modern touches with remnants of Nazi and communist rule. We trundled through the city in the Trabant with almost rock-star status. The Trabants were such a symbol of all that was wrong with communism that when the Soviet Union collapsed in 89 the Trabants were relegated to the scrap heap of history. A few young, enterprising Hungarians have taken to saving the Trabant and really have made them better than when they were new. All of the attention we got was from locals who were amazed to see such fine examples of the cars on the road. We got to see a lot of the highlight of Budapest, some local hangouts and even a home cooked meal. The slow speed and excellent view from the Trabant allowed for great stories and beautiful pictures. The best part of the experience was the love our guide, Balazs had for Hungary, Trabants and visitors. A great experience!"

He is professional and points out interesting facts and places that we could visit on our own, beyond the usual tourist spots. The tour started off with a overview of the history of Hungary which provided context and an insight into the Hungarian psyche. This was done in a cafe that was a throwback to the 1960s, in a very relaxed atmosphere. The city tour was fairly quick, we spent time at the Gellert Spa ( for just a quick look), the citadel, the great market hall, freedom square and 3 interesting cafes to check out on another day. Although we took sometime at each place taking photos, Andras was patient with us and with my mom who walked at a slower pace. Then off to Andras' parents house for a delicious home cooked Hungarian lunch. This was really the highlight of the tour for me. His parents' hospitality really made us feel welcomed in their home. Such a lovely couple! We were also treated to a private performance of gypsy / Hungarian music which was enjoyable. My mom and I didn't join the walking tour after that but I heard from my husband and son, who did, that Andras took them to some interesting places that most tourists don't get to see or won't know about.All in, I liked the fact that it was a private tour, done at our own pace. Highly recommended for an informative and friendly introduction to Budapest and Hungary."

Andr\u00e1s was a great guide and led us through a number of experiences unlike any other tour we've ever been on -- a discussion of Hungarian history in a quirky cafe, a Hungarian lunch with his family, and even a private concert. The more conventional sightseeing portion of the tour was also well-done, with a separate driver dropping us off at a number of sights throughout the city and picking us up to move to the next sight when we were done. The small group size (ours was 4, maximum of 8) was great in keeping a very personal feel to the tour.We just got home from a five-city European vacation, and the Hungarian Soul tour was definitely my favorite tour of the trip.

This was our 2nd time returning to Budapest and it was our honeymoon, so it had to be a special experience filled with the best people. We had utilized My Personal Budapest for the Trabant tour in October 2015, so when it came time to plan the honeymoon, September 2016 trip, I reached out to the company again, to see if we could hire a driver for our 9 days in Budapest. Attila responded to me very quickly and gave us a very fair price. Each day, he was prompt and showed up a few minutes early to pick us up at our apartment by Parliament. It's a small detail, but I appreciated that his car was always clean and smelled good (I'm a real estate agent, so this is one of those small details that really made it nice!). Since my hubbie and I had already seen a lot of Budapest's historical sights, we turned this more into an eating and shopping tour. Attila was very accommodating and happily took us to any store/mall/outlet mall we wanted to go to. He even set up what we jokingly called the \"Rich Man's Pub Crawl\" for us one night and drove us to the Merkur, The Ritz Carlton, The Aria SkyTop Bar and The Four Seasons where we enjoyed cocktails and light snacks at each of them.... A lot of fun for a night!!! ...not to mention, getting to experience the amazing Hungarian red wines!!!On the day we visited the House of Terror Museum, there were important dignitaries that caused the museum's opening to be delayed. Attila quickly came up with a 'Plan B\" to help us find something else to do, while we waited and then, when we returned, he personally walked us to the door to ensure that we were able to get entrance with no issues. He is just a class act that truly cares...Our last day together, there was a lot of cloudy skies and rain, so we turned that day into a photo shooting day. Attila took us to all the beautiful places and took our photos with our camera and iPhones, in front of the special places. This amazing act of kindness allowed us to have a lot of photos with BOTH of us in them and not just choppy looking selfies. I highly recommend this as an idea for any tourist that is traveling with their loved one(s).... It is so worth the money and you will LOVE having beautiful photos of both of you in front of the amazing architecture that is beautiful Budapest!We are planning our return visit already for May 2017... Attila and My Personal Budapest Tours will definitely be on our radar... Just can't say enough, how truly special he made our honeymoon.... Like a fairy tale... Thank you, Attila!!!! Much Love from Florida,Angie & Kirk"

I was researching various tours in Budapest that met my needs (single woman who has zero knowledge and experience with Hungary), and I happened to come across MyPersonalBudapest via a quick Google search. They seemed to offer everything that I was looking for my trip, and so I contacted the company via email a few months beforehand. I received a reply back fairly quickly from Attila Kiss, and we worked together to come up with a plan and prices for my week in Budapest. Attila not only answered my questions that I had about the tours promptly and thoroughly, but he was also a wonderful guide when it came time for my trip in this beautiful city.Attila was always on time and very accommodating. I initially inquired about tours for single individuals, but eventually one of my relatives decided to join in on the trip and Attila worked out the budget to include and accommodate her as well. We had an amazing time with him! He was very knowledgeable about the city and locations, and whatever he didn't know he did his best to find out for us. He showed us 'secret' places that most tourists miss out on while in Hungary, and he was always hilarious! Attila the Pungarian, is a fit name for this funny tour guide! He was also very gracious and helped me to learn some Hungarian while I was there. Pro tip, a little bit of the language goes a long way!It was a little awkward at first as I had booked Attila for 5 whole days...something that apparently most people don't do, but he made it so fun and amazing that it felt like I was with a friend the whole time. Time flew by during the long car rides to the outer cities, and we never ran out of things to talk about from a range of topics including the long history of Budapest and Hungary to A.I. and Pokemon Go. Attila always did his best to keep us entertained and informed during the tours. We ended up splitting 3 days to explore Budapest as I had specific requests to see certain places and to space out the tours so that we wouldn't be too overwhelmed with the schedule. We also booked the Szentendre, Danube Bend, wine tasting, and Lake Balaton tours...Basically almost everything that the company had to offer, but it was so worth it and everything was personalized to what you want to see and do! Honestly if you have the time and money, spend more time in Budapest and Hungary! I thought it was well worth the money and planning. I felt like I got to really learn about the culture and history of Budapest and Hungary with Attila. From my initial contact with the company to actually meeting Attila in person, everything was handled very professionally and smoothly. He really went out of his way to fulfill my requests for the tours, and I am super impressed with how 'personal' MyPersonalBudapest really is! I will never forget my time in Budapest thanks to Attila, and I would definitely recommend others to contact MyPersonalBudapest if they're looking for a guide in Budapest! I hope to come back again sometime in the future! Thanks again for such an unforgettable trip!"

My wife and I were looking for a personal tour of beautiful Budapest that took in a few major areas but also included a locals view of this wonderful city. We were only available on Thursday and wanted an afternoon tour. Andras hooked us up with his colleague Balazs who offered a unique 4 hour opportunity to see the city from a Communist-era auto called a Trabant. Small but spotless and comfortable (only 2-door) the Trabant drew stares and salutes from the natives and we easily negotiated some narrow streets and found parking where little existed. In addition to the standard tourist narration of major sites, Balazs also imparted to us insight into what it felt like to grow up in a city bursting out following the withdrawal of communism. We also loved seeing the beautiful residential areas, vibrant but off the beaten path. You must be open to a non-typical tourist experience to appreciate the tour, as well as be willing to exit the car at several stops. If you're looking for something different from the large group bus tours THIS is the experience you will remember."

Our favourite parts of the tour were: (1) our lovely and passionate tour guide, Bal\u00e1zs, (2) being driven around in his beautiful vintage car, and (3) the visits to the towns just outside of Budapest. It was a great breather to get away from the city and to see a side of Budapest that we would have otherwise not have gotten a chance to explore without this tour. Bal\u00e1zs was extremely warm and welcoming, and had great knowledge and love for this city. We got to take beautiful pictures of the Danube bend from scenic spot, tried delicious local coffee and cakes, got a brief tour around an artistic town, and even got to step into the grounds of Slovakia. An addition that my family selected to this tour was the strawberry wine tasting. Although the strawberry wines were very unique and were indeed interesting to try, we felt that the inclusion of this was at the expense of the exploration of the small towns. As the tour that I've chosen was a mere one-day tour, it would have sufficed without the supplementary activities (such as: motor boat tours, ceramic workshops, wine tasting, etc.). Although highly interesting, I would personally only recommend these activities to those who are doing a longer tour (spanning a few days), or to those who have a particular interest in them, purely due to the lack of time. Overall, I still highly recommend this tour to anyone and feel that it is suitable for all as they are very flexible and open to tailoring it to your needs and interests."

If you can, ask that Andras be your guide; he was professional, personable, kind, and patient with us with all our requests, questions, shopping interests ;). A short drive from old Buda, Andras took us through to the enchanting countryside north of the country - the charming, artsy Szentendre (with shopping stops if you wish to do so), Esztergom (first capital with its castle ruins), the Szentendre island, all the towns along the way to the famous Danube Bend. Andras showed us the best viewpoints, local stops, and a \"secret spot\" ;). We had lunch at this AWESOME local seafood restaurant. Best grilled trout EVER- so fresh!, but I think my ultimate favorite portion of the tour was when we were introduced to his friend (he showed around his mansion), we also met his sweet mom, who embraced us guests like family. We enjoyed the strawberry wine tastings (I probably had 4 glasses haha) and home-made dessert to top it all off! On our return to Pest, we chanced upon a farmer selling raspberries and garlic along the road..even though we are already way over our schedule, Andras stopped, we got to say hello to the locals and try out fresh raspberries- YUM!

I can sum up the experience in one sentence; before the tour I didnt know much about Budapest, hungary and its people, after the tour I feel confident to say that I understand how the people and their customs have shaped the beautiful city. Some of my favourite parts of the tour include:- A great meal in the house of a Roma family where we tasted the local cuisine and learned more about their traditions and culture. - An insightful bus tour that took us to the most interesting sights of the city including some hidden gems. - the knowledge and great stories about the city and the country provided by our guide and the historian that taught us about the Hungarian history.- Free ticket for the parliament tour! worth the visit. Ideal for both solo and small group travellers that want to do more than just enjoy the sights of the beautiful city, but also want to learn what is behind them and how the city evolved and shaped. Especially interesting for people with little time that want to make the most of a one or two day visit! The guides also give you great tips of where to go after the tour is over. Thank you to our guide Andr\u00e1s for a great and insightful visit!"

First, our guide Bal\u00e1zs, what a great guy, knowledgeable, enthusiastic and a very nice chap to boot!Second, the car, a super example of a Trabant, what else for a Budapest tour. This car was clean and fun, lovingly restored and modified by Bal\u00e1zs himself!Don't expect air-con or the hieght of luxury - the whole point of this tour is that it is in a Trabant, so whingers beware!Thirdly, some off the beaten spots with local knowledge thrown in.The only thing we would have changed was the cafe WE chose to stop at, Bal\u00e1zs offered two, a sixties retro place, which was great by the way and if this is your bag, go for it. On reflection we would have chosen the Art Nouveau cafe.Our trip to Budapest was only for three days, not enough in our opinion as there is so much to see and do!That said we are going to go back, before we do we will be contacting Bal\u00e1zs to organise another bespoke tour.Thanks Bal\u00e1zs see you soonSteve and Gaynor"

We did the Danube Bend tour and Attila was both knowledgeable and flexible, We went to Szentendre, a small town with an array of small shops selling local artist pottery and trinkets. Don't miss the miniature museum. We then proceeded to a local \"off the beaten path\" spot. A local beach spot along the Danube river. Our last stop was Hungary's largest Catholic Church. First we crossed a bridge to Slovakia for a vantage point and then back to Hungary for a visit inside. Attila engaged with us, was entertaining and very knowledgable. He shared information about Budapest as well, which was not part of our tour. High recommend."

We toured sights on both sides of the river and ended the tour with an understanding of the city and saw a number of \"hidden\" sights, including a wonderfully decorative roof on the government building that is only visible from the roof of a hotel nearby, and funky bar and open air market buried in the narrow streets of Pest. The tour lasted most of the day and involved enough walking to recommend comfortable shoes and clothes (Budapest can get quiet warm). And definitely bring a camera. The architecture is unique and well worth photographing, and the guide will insure that get all the photo ops that you might want. The tour was tailored to my request provided in advance when booking the tour and we got everything I wanted to see and photograph. Compared to some other private tours I've booked in Eurpoe, I found My Personal Budapest to be of excellent quality and very reasonably priced."

You start off in a cafe to hear about history for over an hour. One drink included. Then we got into a very hot van and rode around to see sights that Hungarian people don't like. We saw one monument that they liked. Then we got into the hot van, windows up with an AC that was terrible drove for over 30 minutes to eat lunch at 2 or 3:00. Needless to say we were starving. Loved the couple who had us in their home and food was great. We just wish it would have been closer. Then we drove over 30 minutes back to listen to a gypsy band. We felt uncomfortable in the small room with just a band playing. I will tell you that the idea & people are 5 star but the actual tour was a 1 star. The reviews they have online was not for this actual tour. I just want to state again we did like the people not the actual tour. Also there was only one hidden treasure a bookstore cafe that we ended our tour in. I do give George & Gizzy who had us in their home 10 stars."

Yes, you feel the Soul of Hungary starting with the warm welcome of the guide, the humor and knowledge of the 'historian', the love of the home cooked meal and the passion of the Roma concert. The tour is probably more for someone who has seen the tourist highlights already but wants to get closer to the people. It is a very personal tour and the guide Andreas, was a pleasure to spend the day with. Lots of laughs, a few tears and many hugs. I traveled with my husband, 2 sons, ages 35 and 29 and a daughter-in-law. We all thought the tour was amazing."

For various reasons on my side, I had to communicate with Andras multiple times by phone and by e-mail and he was always responsive. Andras picked us up at our apartment right on time and as he drove us to Szentendre, he talked about Budapest and its history, the areas we were passing through and the history of Szentendre. We had a great time with Laszlo and Gabriella during our private ceramics lesson. They were so welcoming. We were also able to purchase some of Gabriella's beautiful ceramic items to take home. Next, we went into Szentendre proper, but while Andras showed us the usual tourist shops, we spent minimal time there, instead going off on side streets, eating traditional Hungarian langos, a fried flatbread. After a visit to the Baroque-Rococo Greek-Orthodox Blagovestenska church and the amazing Marzipan museum, we were off to Visegrad for amazing views of the Danube Bend. Andras also took us to visit his 'secret' spot which unfortunately was a little flooded, but still beautiful. One of the highlights of the afternoon was visiting a trout restaurant A Pisztrangos in Visegrad, a restaurant for locals, serving only trout. Delicious! We each ate every last bit of our fish. We went up near an old castle for some more amazing Danube views and then Andras dropped us off to catch the ferry back to Budapest. We were treated to more beautiful views of the countryside from the water as we traveled home after a wonderful day. Thanks you, Andras, too, for recommending the Budapest Bistro. We had a great dinner there."

Not so on this tour! I paid using PayPal, it was easy. This tour started understandably at the beginning...by reviewing the City's history and events over coffee/tea at the \"Communist Caf\u00e9\" a qwerty and unique place with 1950's radios, TVs, and other in the windows, all over the Caf\u00e9 was fun memorabilia. After the history we discussed what we wanted to see and by air conditioned mini bus visited the Market, Gell\u00e9rt Spa, and Chain Bridge. We made 4 stops and a highlight was the magnificent architecture of Hotel Gell\u00e9rt and its Spa, and the views from on top of Buda. I should mention that although there is a plan you have a vote.We admired the amazing view of the city from the Citadel and got off for a short walk on Liberty Square and also in the City Park. Photo opportunities were everywhere we went.The next thing we did was a big surprise and the four of us really enjoyed it...we had a lovely Hungarian lunch in the home of a Hungarian family, which means we met with friendly and progressive Hungarians in their own home as well as enjoyed traditional Hungarian cooking in a relaxed atmosphere. The food was amazing and none of us needed dinner that night! On our drive back to downtown Budapest after lunch we enjoyed some heart-warming melodies from Liszt and another Hungarian composers. It was a private concert!We visited some places that have been left out of guidebooks as well.This is a ~8 hour tour, some walking, some bus, we got a tour of the city and afterwards we were prepared to venture out on our own. Don't worry if you are on a cruise to Budapest, this tour will not duplicate your tour.I would call this tour relaxing though. I never felt rushed. That is rare among tours in Budapest. This is the best tour in Budapest, look no further."

Andras's parents were very gracious, and the food was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed it, and it gave us an insight into Hungarian daily life. Another highlight was a private concert by five Roma musicians performing Hungarian music. They were accomplished musicians, and we were moved by the soulful sounds of their music. We made a stop at a retro communist cafe and had a interesting slide presentation with commentary by a student of Hungarian history. Other more conventional tour stops included the Gellert Baths, the Citadel, the Opera House, a secluded city park square, among others. Andras was very knowledgeable, and his English is excellent. At no time did we feel rushed during the tour. It was very relaxing and interesting, and utilized both van transportation and some walking. Best tour we had in Budapest!"

All we had to do was let Andr\u00e1s know what we had already seen and he formulated a tour just for us. It started out having a conversation with an expert on Hungary's history at a unique coffee house. He took us places that we would have never seen as they were not the usual \"tourist\" attractions. We had a wonderful dinner with his parents in thier home. They really went all out to set a beautiful table and the food was scrumptious. Then we all (parents included) went to a concert just for us by a group of gypsy musicians and it was entertaining and educational. One of the musicians gave us a history of gypsy music and it was so interesting. They were great. I didn't mention that we also received free tickets to the Parliament from Andr\u00e1s and visited it the day before. Wow, what a building! We had a tour guide who spoke English very well and gave us an amazing amount of information. Don't miss touring the inside of the Parliament building. I would recommend this My Personal Budapest because it didn't feel like 10,000 facts and/or dates spewed out by a guide that had a memorized a script. My mind tends to \"turn off\" when people talk that way. It was an 8 hour tour I believe and well worth the money."

When I tried to book on his site, he had different offerings at the time and I chose a personal tour but I see he has since changed his website and no longer offers what I originally wanted which was the Trabant tour around the city. He convinced me to take this tour instead and now realize why. We first went to a coffee shop for an hour long history lesson. After 30 minutes, we had enough. His guide was very nervous and the whole thing was way too long to be indoors on such a beautiful day. We rode around the city on a bus and then went to his house for lunch. The food was okay. This was the only highlight. The 2 hour music concert, again indoors, was nice but way too long. If this was outside we could perhaps have tolerated it better. Sadly, we are not fans of classical music. Overall I would recommend this if you don't mind sitting for long periods and have a greater appreciation for classical music."

It was a full day but we never felt rushed and we really enjoyed the scenery while driving to the destinations. While in Esztergom, we had lunch at a great local restaurant. Balazs was a fantastic guide and gave us a wonderful history of Hungary. It was my husband's and our friend's first tour in Hungary, I have been before but found out far more information from Balazs than I did a few years ago. Balazs also stropped at a local bakery for some yummy bread and desserts. It was great! The highlight was the winery. I can't begin to explain how happy i was I added this on. It was a beautiful vineyard and the staff was wonderful and the cheese plate was out of this world. The wine was to die for! It was simply one of the best tours I've ever been on and I have been on many. They also have the cutest dog on the property but sadly, I have forgotten his name but he is the most adorable French Bulldog that loved to play. We all just loved Balazs and felt like we walked away with a new friend. So grateful to him for making this such a memorable day for us. I highly recommended getting out of the city if you have the opportunity and take this tour!"

My mom and I took the Soul of Hungary tour with Andr\u00e1s and his company My Personal Budapest. I have lived and played in Europe since 2001, I have been on numerous tours in numerous countries and by far, the Soul of Hungary tour has been the very best. It was a small, intimate tour with just two other people, both of whom, I am sure enjoyed the tour as much as we did. Andr\u00e1s made us feel as though we weren\u2019t just tourists, but long-lost family, getting reacquainted with our homeland. We met in the Astoria district and took an informative walk to a beautiful park, the Karolyi Kert (where Andr\u00e1s grew up and played!), and then onto an amazing caf\u00e9, called the T\u00e1skar\u00e1di\u00f3 Eszpressz\u00f3 B\u00e1r and Bisztr\u00f3. Here we watched a presentation given by a wonderful speaker whose name I have, unfortunately, forgotten, but it gave all of us a wonderful overview of the amazing history of Hungary and Budapest. After this refreshing break, we boarded a van and headed out to the major sites. Although we didn\u2019t stay long at each of the sites, our morning was filled with history and words\u2026 Words that gave us an insight to how Hungarians see themselves and what they think the world thinks of them. After the morning tour, we headed to Andr\u00e1s\u2019 parents\u2019 home for a lovely four course luncheon. We were warmly greeted by his parents and had an aperitif to get our gustatory juices flowing. (Andr\u00e1s was kind enough to send me a repertoire of his friends Hungarian recipes, many of which I have been chomping at the bit to try!) The reception and hospitality that his parents gave felt like a warm hug, I certainly could not have asked for more. I feel fortunate to have experienced their loving home!After luncheon, we headed back into the Budapest proper to the Jewish Community Center behind the famous Opera House on Andrassy ut. Once there we were treated to the most amazing and spectacular Romany Gypsy Music concert. For me, this was the most marvelous and best part of the tour. Yes, eating with Andr\u00e1s\u2019 family was beyond my expectations and visiting all the famous sites and learning about the colorful history of Hungary was far beyond fabulous, but the music portion of the day completely took me by surprise and moved me to tears. I was so touched by this particular experience that I forgot to buy the CD! Andr\u00e1s, if you read this, I need a CD by those artists!!The Soul of Hungary tour is, without a doubt, singularly, the very best tour of any European/African/Asian tour I have ever been on. So much so that I will be returning to Budapest with my husband and son and will be taking another tour with Andr\u00e1s!"

I spent my Easter holiday in Budapest and was lucky enough to have Attlia as my Guide, (Andras didn't leave me alone although I was the only paticipant on that day)I was picked up from my hotel and after the visit of all city essential sightseeings, we had a wonderful lunch at a \"secret tip\" bistro. Attila never let me bored for one single minute with his humor and rubic cubes...Highly recommended."

I did some canvassing on private tours and My Personal Budapest had the best rates so a few days before, I booked the tour with them. It is a 5 hour car tour flexible to your interests and needs. I was traveling with my mother who is a PWD and my sister. Balazs, our tour guide was awesome, he usually does the tour with a Trabant but upon telling them my mother's condition, he was considerate to borrow his parents car with a large legroom that was more comfortable. Balazs was a gracious host eagerly sharing the city's rich history, architecture, cool spots and markets. Next time around I will book the Trabant or walking tour. I recommend this tour for those with special needs or want to go at their own pace."

But Andras did not disappoint with the back up plan. He was completely flexible and drove me around on a private tour of all the major sites and some of the lesser known ones, including some great cafes and the Hospital in the Rock museum. Andras is very passionate about his city and loves to share his vast knowledge of both modern and contemporary history. Had a great day!"

Our tour guide Balazs was very personable and also very knowledgeable, not only about Budapest but also about the history and culture of Hungary and its stand in current world events. He was very happy to tailor and adapt the tour, and as we had been to the Christmas market the night before we were able to shorten our time there and add time elsewhere. The cultural center was informative and fun as we made our own traditional Christmas decoration, we walked the chain bridge, saw parliament, made our own chimney cakes at the Christmas stall, had a private organ performance in a church, visited a retro cafe, walked the Jewish quarter, and all the time Balazs kept us well informed and engaged with information, answering our many questions about Budapest. It was a fantastic introduction on our first day in this beautiful city.We used public transport which was covered in the tour cost, and helped us get a feel for the system. We were so impressed with our guide Balazs that we booked a second tour a few days later in his restored trabant car."

We elected to do a day trip combination tour of 'Christmas Tour and Hidden Gems' on foot. This was my request and not one specific tour. Having seen so many Christmas markets already we did not wish to be too immersed in the Christmas hype. Our guide was Balazs. Initially I was worried as we did not have a tour with the owner Andras. Within seconds I realised there was nothing to worry about. Balazs was absolutely WONDERFUL! He responded to all our requests on the day, was incredibly attentive and patient and absolutely to be recommended. We enjoyed a visit to a Hungarian small museum/craft/place where I think many school groups visit. The Christmas tradition was explained by a local girl with Balazs translating. We even made traditional Christmas decorations and certainly laughed a lot. Of course this is not for everyone, but we really enjoyed it. We also had a private organ recital in a tiny church-just for us. We were able to talk with the organist about his role etc. This was really informative and beautiful. The day also included many other highlights- local cafes unknown to most tourists, the Jewish Qtr etc. Balazs was so incredibly knowledgeable about his country and he shared a lot with us. My recommendation is to email many questions and really find out what your tour involves as these guys are very helpful and do everything they can to make your special trip totally worthwhile. Actually we loved it so much and thought Balazs was so good, that we also did a half day Trabant tour with Balazs on our last day in Hungary. We drove out to Szentendre in his fully restored unique (to us) car, and enjoyed a relaxed visit at our own pace before heading to the International airport to go home. We would all definitely recommend My Personal Budapest and Balazs. THANK YOU!"

My husband Neal and I were visiting Vienna over the holidays and we decided to do a side trip to Budapest, making a roundtrip via train in one day. For our time in Budapest we selected the Trabant tour, which was both informative and fun. Our guide, Bal\u00e1zs, was very personable. It was great getting a view of Budapest from someone who is fluent in English, knowledgable of its history, and personally connected to its destiny. Going via Trabant was quirky--it is a small, very basic antique car--but this added to the fun. It was actually very cool that Bal\u00e1zs owns the car and maintains it. As a result of the tour we not only got a great overview of the city, we also made a resolution to revisit Budapest in the future and spend more time there."

I also asked my guide, Attila, to make his focus on what I needed to know to begin to understand Hungary, which is not an easy job for a country with a long and sometimes painful history, and he did that very well.I thought that the mix of driving by and looking at some places and getting out and walking around or going in others briefly was a good balance, and I knew a lot more when we finished than I did when we started. And I am motivated to find a good history of Europe and learn more.I was impressed with the flexibility the company offers when I saw their web site, and with Attila as we organized the day. In additional to concentrating on Hungarian history as I requested, he recommended a nice little restaurant for me to visit for lunch at the end of the tour, he suggested that since I seemed to be interested in history that I might want to spend the rest of the afternoon at the Terror House, and he took me to the train station to pick up an advance purchase train ticket from a vending machine that I thought might give me trouble because the directions would be in Hungarian only.If I were in Budapest again, I would definitely take another of their tours and I would ask for Attila."

We had booked 8 hours (two tours) with the company to run consecutively on our first day in Budapest.(highlights of the city and hidden gems) Unfortunately our flight to Budapest got cancelled and we reached Budapest only in the latter half of the proposed day. We texted Attila to let him know and he was kind enough to agree to just half day tour starting 2 pm when we would reach hotel. Firstly, this tour is not cheap in any way and to our utter surprise, we were charged for full 8 hours and not half. I am not sure which culture and norms presumes you have to pay full price for a half job but it sure does not where I come from. There is a name for it and its called \"dishonesty\". And it doesn't end there. When I asked what to pay at the end of the tour, I was told a figure 10 Euros higher than the agreed upon price (the company has no prices on its website and all prices are agreed upon by personal emails with client, at least it was with me) and then told, since we didnt do the whole 8 hours, we are being given a discount of 10 Euros. This really took the cake. We did not want to get into any arguments (which we totally could have) and paid the full price which really stung for less than half the tour delivered. Now for the actual tour:I dont know what the original plan for our tour was but as it stood, I believe a lot could have been achieved in around 4 hours but it was mostly driving to stuff and seeing it from outside in a very very rushed manner. If I wanted that flavour, then I would have booked a Viator/coach/group tour. The reason one books a private/personal tour is so that the pace can be casual and more personal but we felt like we had to rush everywhere while seeing each thing for 5 secs. 4 hours is less than what we hoped for too, but it was still a lot if it was well planned. Personally, there could have been less NUMBER of sites in a good pace than running around ticking things off a list- probably because the plan was to charge for full 8 hours and that would make a better argument.I am not sure if what do do with us for 4 hours was at all planned, we rushed around a lot and when I requested a coffee stop I almost regretted it because we spent around 15 mins looking for a coffee shop (yes!!) that had suitable parking. Arentt these the sort of things you assume your \"private and personal\" tour would entail? Our guide was Attila and he was a nice enough person and we had good conversation with him, this review is not a personal vindication against him (seems many other people liked him from other reviews) but rather a statement of facts from our actual experience which for which we paid very steeply and were quite disappointed. We booked another private tour in Budapest the next day and thankfully it was wonderful so I would recommend considering other companies rather than this one when booking your Budapest tour, else you can be out of a lot of money with no real value."

It was a cold and windy day so our guide brought his personal car (a 1957 Opel) rather than walk us through the sites. Very grateful he did as it made our tour much more comfortable and enjoyable.

This is the real advantage of the tour, you have a local guide who can taylor the tour to your needs. Bal\u00e1zs is a genuine enthusiast with an encyclopaedic knowledge of Trabants. He also knows how to drive one, and treated us to some amazing videos of him driving one of his collection on two wheels! After the tour of Budapest we drove into the countryside to a local wine producing region. Here we were given a tour of the cellar from our brilliant and knowledgeable host. The wine tasting was brilliant, with some excellent sauvignon, chardonnay and local varieties. This was followed by an equally wonderful lunch before being driven back to our hotel.I couldn't recommend this company enough, they have the knowledge and skill to provide a brilliant, bespoke tour. The Trabants are great fun and a practical way to see this beautiful city. If you're a petrol-head it's a must. The wine tour complements the Trabant tour well and both the food and wine were better than I expected."

The first was the presentation by a young PhD student on the history of Hungary in a Communist-era cafe. It was well-paced and used multimedia presentations to good effect. Following that we did some sightseeing that was tailored specifically for us based on what we had already seen. The second was a meal with a local Hungarian family. We enjoyed traditional food and Christmas cakes. The other was a private concert for our group by an ensemble of 5 Hungarian Gypsy musicians, who were excellent.

Next we boarded a small bus for a driving tour that included many stops that were not included in the Viking itinerary I previosuly provided Andras - some timely planning and customizing! We drove out of the city for lunch at his parent's house and were served a wonderful meal, along with some real conversation with his parents. Next we drove to a local meeting facility and were treated to a great performance of \"gypsy\" music by a group of professional musicians that are talented enough to perform anywhere. We ended with a visit to a \"ruins\" bar and a walk back to our hotel - a full day to be sure.My main complaint was the time we spent on the bus. If this tour included less \"bus time\", I would give it 5 stars for sure. Also, I would recommend you keep your group to 6 or 8.

We then toured the city in a comfortable mini bus and visited the main sites of interest. We then went to the home of Andras parents for a home lunch. They made us very welcome and we had a delicious home cooked meal.We then went to a concert hall and has a private concert which was surreal. Amazingly talented ensemble.

With no power steering and frequent re-starts, Attila made it look easy driving around the city.

There is so much history in Budapest, it's impossible to get bored hearing about their rich past.

We can all find the highlights ourselves via the internet but what makes travel truly memorable is a window into the culture, its people and the history that shapes its society. Our first day was spent in memorable little Trabant cars, a throwback to East German engineering. This would merely be silly except for the fact of the loving attention given these classic \"peoples' cars of communism\" by young Balasz. These cars generate so much local goodwill and nostalgia, Balasz is so knowledgeable about them, and we got the added bonus of his Dad as additional driver and window into local society. They provided lovely guidance into out-of-the-way corners of local woods, street foods and Estergom's beautiful cathedral and overlook. That was great fun! Andras then showed us his own Budapest. We got the \"Soul\" of his city first with a concise exposition of Hungarian history and then a peek into some more contemporary events like the failed revolution against the Russians. We also got a taste of quirky Art Nouveau architecture and things like an old casino now housing a very modern cafe. Top of the list, though, was the intimate meal with Andras' parents! That will NOT happen on the big bus tours, obviously. A real family, a real traditional meal, real local plum brandy! What's not to like? This is a five star experience delivered by five star guides. Really worth EVERY forint we spent. Thanks A LOT, Andras, we loved every minute and thirsted for more!Mariette, Stephen, Lynnette and Han"

The city itself, along the Danube is just wonderful. It is worthy of the time and effort to visit this city, one of the greatest ones in Europe. We have been to Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, Rome, Lucerne, Vienna, Venice, Malaga, Granada and Milan among others. It ranks right up there with the best. However, for us the highlight was to be able to photograph it at night. In looking for a tour that would accomplish this I corresponded with a guy named Balazs for some time and he assured me that he would do everything possible to make the tour exactly what we wanted. My partner is quite good at night time photography. Originally I had planned for us to just spend one day in Budapest, coming by boat from Vienna. But he had read, and rightly so that Budapest is the most beautiful city in Europe to photograph at night. So Balazs, our guide picked us up in his Trabant, an East German car. He is very proud of his unusual automobile, which incidentally he restored himself. Anyway, I get side tracked. He met us at the Iberostar Hotel at 7pm (He was actually a little early) and the first stop was Vajdahunyad Castle and Hosoktere or as we would say \"Heroes Square\". He thought it important that we see this important landmark, even though it wasn\u2019t yet quite dark. From there we ventured to the Parliament Building, among the most beautiful found anywhere, up to the Matyas Church, to another hill to capture the whole of the cityscape and finally to St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica. Along the way he pointed out the Opera House, the Secret Police Museum, the Chain Bridge, etc. He loves his country and gave us an interesting perspective on the changes that have taken place since the fall of communism in his country. He is an enterprising young man with big dreams, a wonderful personality and a love for his country and city. This tour was truly the highlight of our time in Budapest, but it was not the only highlight as we enjoyed the people, the food, the spa and the monuments, especially the Shoe Monument along the river very much. We didn\u2019t know much about Budapest before going except that it was very beautiful. It is that, but it is so much more. We enjoyed our time there very much and would encourage others to journey to see it as well! If you do though, make sure you hook up a tour with Balazs at My Personal Budapest Tours!!!!"

The Hungarian lunch option was absolutely amazing! We met Balazs' parents Janos and Maria who welcomed us to their home and served us an excellent meal with great beverages. We shared a lot of laughs with them. We thought the lunch experience would be too awkward but after meeting the parents it was totally relaxing and one of the better parts of the day. Janos even treated us to a sip of some fine Hungarian fruit liquor - very nice! As a bonus, Balazs drove us back to the city in a different vintage car, an old 50's Opel. What a blast! Balazs is a truly talented and personable young man who has great love and passion for old automobiles (even fixing them!). I give the tour experience an A+++.

The first day was in a vintage communist car called a Trabant and it was great driving around the city while attracting the attention of many locals who remember having those cars. The tour to all the city attractions was very informative, personalized, and Balazs was terrific. He is extremely knowledgeable, professional and caters to whatever you would like to see---in other words, he is very flexible and tries to make every tour a little bit different by gearing it to what his clients tastes are. The city tour was followed by lunch at his home with his lovely mother doing the cooking. It was fantastic!!! His mother is a great cook---several different types of h'ors d'ouevres accompanied by wine, beer and some Hungarian liquor was how lunch was started. This was followed by a most delicious tomato soup and baked chicken with potatoes and vegetables. The meal ended with a layer cake that looked wonderful but I was too full at that point to continue eating. After lunch, we resumed our tour with the hidden gems of Budapest which included some ruin bars, interesting neighborhoods and a bit of shopping. This tour was well paced and very enjoyable. I would highly recommend it. Day two with Balazs was out into the countryside in another vintage car to the Danube Bend and the town of Szentendre. Beautiful scenery and the artists' town of Szentendre is very interesting and full of charm. He then brought us back to our hotel to drop off packages (from shopping we had done) and dropped us off at the wine festival near the Palace (which was incredible with over 200 vintners). He didn't have to do this as the tour had concluded but he is just such a kind, wonderful person who wants all his clients to enjoy the most they can in his wonderful city. Balazs has a lot of passion for both his city and his business. I don't think you could ever go wrong hiring him as a guide in Budapest. We really enjoyed Budapest and our time spent with Balazs was one of the reasons why. Book with him or Andros---you won't be sorry."

We particularly like the ruin bar (and there was the freak market going in that day when we visited), Jewish ghetto wall, and the morning coffee break at the local cake shop, tasting some beautiful traditional Jewish cakes.He has also taken us to some secret hidden spots like the cafe inside the book shop and the roof top bar with 360 city view. Before he left us for the day, he also helped us plan and showed us many other places to visit on the map. We have enjoyed the few hours we spent with Balazs L.The next day we were supposed to do the Danube Bend with Andras. He emailed us a few days earlier saying the weather forecast might be bad so he suggested to stay in Budapest. After a few emails, we decided to push our tour a few days later. I think it's the best decision we have made. The three towns Szentendre, Esztergom and Visagrad are beautiful in their own ways. The most enjoyable would have to be the ceramic workshop with Gabriella. She is friendly, personable and really patience with us making a mess of the clay. We did not want to leave her workshop.But the most special has to be Andras' secret spot. We promised him not to mention as it won't be a secret anymore.

But a local guide will have a much better grasp of when those sites are open and how to skip the lines, which restaurants cater to locals, and how to transform your plan into an efficient, leisurely itinerary. Clyde and I knew we wanted to see the standard sites, but how do these fit together? What\u2019s the best order to see them in, based on their opening and closing times? Is there a time of day when these will be less crowded with river cruise tourists? And how do you get from A to B?To get answers to these questions \u2014 and to make the most of our limited time in the city \u2014 we contacted Andras of MyPersonalBudapest.com. While he was already booked up for the day, he connected us with his associate: a smart, knowledgable young man named Balazs. (Say \u201cBuh-lawsh.\u201d)Balazs meets us at our hotel (swooping in on his motorbike) and joins his friend, Peter, who brings along his Communist-era Trabant car. After admiring the tiny two-stroke engine and a hot wired air-conditioner that would make any hacker proud, we drive off to see the sights.Balazs and Peter\u2019s tour takes us through all the right neighborhoods, with stops for photos and walks and excursions at all the right places: the Chain Bridge, Castle Hill, the Matthias Church, the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion, the zoo. Along the way, we notice how Peter\u2019s Trabant delights everyone we drive past, from locals (who still feel a nostalgia for the cars) to tourists (who have never seen anything quite like it). Peter\u2019s car makes everybody smile \u2014 including us. At lunch, Peter drops us off in the Jewish Quarter, but Balazs stays with us, taking us to a Sunday market in Budapest\u2019s best-known ruin bar, a tasty lunch at Karavan (a block of food stalls), a stroll by the Tree of Life at the Dohany Street Synagogue, a walk through Heroes\u2019 Square, a visit to a controversial monument (with a magical fountain), a photo op outside Parliament, and a tour through St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica. It\u2019s a fact: Balazs makes every minute of our day better. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s flexible. He has a dry sense of humor. He\u2019s easy to be with, so you feel less like you\u2019re on a tour and more like you\u2019re just hanging out with a local friend. He knows Budapest in the way only locals can know it.Could we see all these sights on our own? Of course. But we couldn\u2019t see them as efficiently as we see them with Balazs, who gets us from A to B as smoothly as possible. He also gave us tips on how to organize our next day \u2014 confirming my choice of the Rudas Baths as the best way to Budapest\u2019s bath culture and reserving a scenic sunset cruise on the Danube for us.Balazs also has a gift for mixing conversation with quick, natural little stories about the history of each place. Instead of lecturing, he brings up significant dates and important facts in a relaxed and casual way. He also shares his personal history: his memories of the Communist period, his family\u2019s life in Budapest, and what it\u2019s like to live in Budapest every day with his wife and two kids.So we see Budapest \u2014 and we also see Balazs\u2019 Budapest, through his eyes. And that\u2019s something you can\u2019t get from any crowded river cruise bus tour or any guide book. Put this personalized tour first on your list of things to do, and you\u2019ll feel right at home in Budapest for the rest of your trip."

From a short drive through the beautiful country side; a leisurely walk thought the old town of Szentendre; visiting a local artist and trying out the pottery wheel; and finally a stop at a local winery which included a tour of the vineyard/wine cellar and a light lunch with wine tasting. The owners also shared their amazing story of how they established themselves in Hungary. Andreas was a wealth of information and adjusted the pace and tour to our needs.

Our group of six people took two all day tours with Andras(Andy) from My Personal Budapest..Both days we were picked up at 9:00AM, one we walked or took public transportation, the other in a van. First day we combined the Hidden Treasures and the Culinary Tours. We really enjoyed walking through this beautiful city, seeing the beautiful architecture and learning history about the different neighborhoods, something you would not see on the typical bus tours. During our walk we stopped at a coffee house. For lunch we stopped at a restaurant where Andy ordered six different dishes that all of us were able to share. After more touring we stopped at another restaurant for dessert of many delicious tasting strudel dishes. The next day we took the van on the Danube Bend Tour. Our first stop was the beautiful town of Szentendre were we walked and saw this quaint little town, saw several different sights including the church and Miniature museum, and again stopped for a quick drink and food in a coffee house. Because the rain prevented us from Andy's Plan A, we switched to Plan B and went to Esztergom to visit the cathedral after we had lunch. Prior to our visit inside the church we went over the border into Slavakia for a panoramic view of the basilica. Since Andy is a native of Budapest his knowledge of the city and countryside was so informative, that we learned quite a bit. He is friendly and personable and we all felt \"at home\" with him. Thank you for an experience we all enjoyed and will remember."

Only recommendation would be to have more time walking through Budapest as well or couple this tour with a walking tour as we did not make any stops to tour central Pest or the Castle district on the Buda side (both of which we did on our own but a guide would likely have made it more enlightening). Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Budapest."

The house was immaculately clean. The host and hostess were very warm and friendly. The food was all made from scratch and so delicious! My mother is very picky and this was not a problem. I just emailed ahead and explained the only types of meat she will eat. We just recently returned to home and my mother tells everyone how wonderful her day with Balazs."

The car makes the travelling even more special as it attracts attention as you're driving around.We took the tour on our first full day in Budapest and it gave us a great mix of the top sites and places that we would never have found on our own. Balazs was very informative and is obviously very proud of his wonderful city. We had chatted about the education system and compared it with our daughter's and Balazs even took us past his old school and pointed it out - helping to really make her part of the day and involved.If you are at all nervous about the home lunch then don't be. You don't feel like an intruder but are welcomed as friends. The welcome from Balazs' parents is so very warm, the food fantastic and taking a drive out of the centre of the city is really interesting. They had even kindly prepared a child-friendly back up meal in case the more traditional food wasn't so appealing to our daughter.After Budapest we were visiting other parts of Hungary and Balazs gave us hints and tips on places to go.I cannot recommend these tours highly enough and they will be the first recommendation that I make to anyone I know that is planning a visit to Budapest."

Next time we come here (and we'll definitely be back) calling up Andras will be the first thing we do. I sent an email inquiry about the tours we were interested in, and the time we had remaining for our stay. He replied saying that as we had already visited a lot of the nearby sights that are a must for any visitor, he suggested that we take the Hidden Gems tour for one of our excursions.Andras promptly met us a the scheduled time, and off we went on our walking tour. We walked, and used the tram and subway to visit many interesting and intriguing sites: a beautiful secluded park; a cafe decorated with actual furnishings from the Communist period; another elegant and ornate cafe that served as a hangout and meet up spot for writers and poets years ago; a hotel's rooftop terrace with SPECTACULAR 360 degree views of the city; Liberty Square where you can find an American President strolling up to meet you; an art nouveau building with intriguing decor inside and out; a little known spot with the last surviving portion of the wall around what was the Jewish Ghetto from WW2; and a final stop at one of the famed 'ruin pubs'. Our second day, to a winery in nearby Etyek, was equally fun. Andras picked us up in his car for a 30 minute drive outside the city. We were met by the owner of a family run vineyard in the countryside. It was a perfect day, sunny and picturesque. Inside a contemporary tasting room, we gazed out at the vines, while sampling 5 wines and enjoying cold lunch platters of meats, cheeses, tomatoes and bread. The owner shared how his winery started, the joys and challenges of the business, showed us his wine press, and cellar where barrels of wine were aging. All along the way to these various sites, Andras provided a wealth of information and fun facts. As your tour progresses (and it won't take long), you'll feel more and more like you're with a friend, not just a guide. Andras has a very easy going personality, and a great sense of humor. His knowledge of Hungarian history is evident as he describes the sights, and relates the various political events and circumstances in his commentary. One thing you will definitely be aware of is his pride in, and love for, his city. Let him share that with you, you will be pleased."

It was really good to be able to speak to him 121 about Hungarian history, culture and also hear first hand how Hungarians feel about communism and their more recent history.

I was in Budapest (and then traveled on to Bratislava and Vienna) with 4 friends for my 50th birthday celebration, and we chose the Trabant tour and private home lunch from My Personal Budapest. Andres confirmed everything via e-mail (and suggested some other things we would also enjoy) -- very easy.This tour was definitely one of the highlights of our entire trip! Bal\u00e1zs was our guide, and he and his father drove the 2 Trabants that took us around Budapest. We had a wonderful morning seeing the sites and we learned a great deal about this beautiful city. Everywhere we went, people would point and admire the cars, and even stop to take pictures with them. The Hungarians love their Trabants!The visit to the private home for lunch was awesome -- Andres' parents are very sweet and welcoming, and the food was truly incredible. The entire group talked about this special lunch for days afterward.We all loved every moment of this unique tour. I have no hesitation recommending this company. I only wish we could have stayed longer in Budapest to take a few more of their tours."

As we were picked up at our hotel the fun started straight away. 3 Trabants waited for us, and so many people stopped and took pictures. The cars are just excellent, we were having so much fun, laughing and taking pictures of each other and The highlights of Budapest. We were the attraction and people were taken more pictures of us (the cars) than we were taking of the attractions. Highly recommended."

Since there were 5 of us his father was with him to drive one of the two Trabants. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the history of Hungary. We started at Heroes Square with a lecture about monument and points of interest surrounding the area. From monuments to churches to coffee houses we were thoroughly delighted. We enjoyed driving through the city in the cars, with people taking our picture and waving as we went by. After touring both Pest and Buda we were off for lunch at a \"locals\" home. We were warmly greeted by the couple at their home and made to feel as if we were eating at our own home. The table was beautifully set and the food was magnificent - as was the wine! Thanks so much for a fun day and great overview of Budapest!"

Attila told us stories of different times in the history of Budapest and Hungary, that no one has told us before. We ended near our hotel at a beautiful care for coffee and more tales of Budapest.

We opted to take the boat back to Budapest and Andras purchased the ticket and got us on the boat. Finally, he gave us a lot of great tips on places to go and eat the remainder of out trip.

It was so interesting to hear the personal stories of life in Budapest throughout the years and learn the history of the country. We had also scheduled lunch with his parents, Janos and Maria, at their home on the Buda side. They welcomed us into their home where Maria had prepared a delicious meal.

When he informed us just before the event that Balasz would be our guide for the day, we were somewhat disappointed. But it all turned out to be the best tour we ever had on our extensive travels! Balasz is an exceptional tourguide: young, enthusiastic, energetic, intellegent, knows his city and country very well, has a delightful sense of humour, has very well informed and balanced opnions about anything and everything (including his Trabants!). We forgot something in his beautifully restored 1965 Volvo, and this created the opportunity to meet with Balasz and his family again. Not only did we spent a most informative and enjoyable day with Balasz in countyside, but also created special fond memories by meeting and spending time with his family.We highly recommend without any reservation to book a tour with Balasz - you will be guaranteed to experience bountifull joy, laughter and having lots of fun whilst taking in the magnificent sights that Budapest has to offer.We are already planning our return trip next year. Our trip to Budapest and the surrounding countryside, and especially meeting Balasz, was a life enriching experience."

If you are looking for something truly adventures and unique i definitely recommend this trip.

While visiting Budapest prior to an April Danube river cruise we wanted a private city tour that would give us a better appreciation of the history and customs of the Hungarian people than would be available from the group excursions offered by our ship. The \"Hidden Treasures of Budapest\" walking tour guided by Andras more than met our expectations and was one of the best tours we have ever been on! Andras is charming, well spoken, agreeable, patient, and very passionate and knowledgeable about Hungary and its culture. In 4+ well-paced hours he showed us Karolyi Garden and Palace, said to be the prettiest small park in the city; the lovely baroque University Church ; two beautiful historic cafes (Central, and Alexandra Book Store); the infamous Ghetto wall from the Nazi era; a fabulous panoramic view of all of Budapest from a private roof top; the amusing Szimba Kert ruin pub; and Freedom Square with its architecturally interesting Stock Exchange and Hungarian National Bank buildings, and Soviet Monument ( with a life-sized statue of Ronald Regan pointedly added recently, nearby!) As a finale, Andras invited us to his parents house outside of the city where his delightful mother and father treated us to a full gourmet dinner! Clearly, the \"Hidden Treasures\" tour was a highlight of our Budapest visit and we enthusiastically recommend it."

My sister can post her own review, but I don't think I'd be out of line by saying that our day with Andras, the owner of My Personal Budapest, may have been the highlight of the entire trip.We spent the entire day with Andras. In the morning, Andras met us and we went on a highlight tour of the city in a Trabant driven by another guide's father (Balazs' father). We were able to get a good overview of the city, and it helped us plan our remaining time in Budapest by getting the truth about what attractions were worth our time and money. We were able to take items out of our later days' itinerary because we covered it in the first tour. Andras also answered every question we had about life in Budapest (the education, healthcare and political systems). The Trabant was eye-catching - it was fun to see other tourists take pictures of the little car. And we were able to see the engine and learn about how it ran, which was fun for me as a novice car enthusiast.Highlights of the morning tour were the Great Market Hall, in which Andras recommended certain sausages and baked goods, the view from the Citidel, a quick look at the Gellart Baths and Opera House, and a coffee break at the Alexandra Book Cafe (you must visit this! We went back again for the excellent coffee, food and the ambiance in the room!).Then we went to Andras' parents house for lunch. What a lovely meal! His parents are wonderful hosts and very kind and considerate. My sister was hit very hard by allergies on the day of the tour. She was miserable and a little embarrassed by her coughing and streaming eyes. Andras' parents couldn't have been more kind - they made her take calcium right there at the table, and sent her home with more calcium and other recommendations to help her survive the allergy/asthma attack. Our meal started with a liquor. Then we had juice and appetizers. We sat down to a meal of vegetable soup with fresh veggies. We then had beef in a game sauce over pasta. This was served with a bottle of white wine from Hungary. This wonderful meal was followed up with cake for dessert. This was our favorite cake by far in Hungary - we tried the other two cakes Andras recommended later in our trip, but the cake served by his mother was our favorite. I had coffee, and all the water we could drink. We talked about our itinerary, with Andras translating. It was just a really special part of our trip, and probably our best meal in Hungary!The afternoon was spent doing the Hidden Treasures Tour, which was wonderful. Andras took into account what we had seen on our first day, and was able to add in a stop to a wine store to recommend certain wines and liquors, and we did go back and used his advice for both the wine store and foods we had to try. We saw a ruin pub, and an art deco cafe (buy a dessert to go - we were so full from lunch that we didn't and we regretted not taking some cake home for later). We saw the last remaining bit of the old Jewish Ghetto wall. Andras showed us how to use the tram, which we used for the remaining part of our visit. I can't even describe properly what a great day we had, or capture the experience in words. It was a wonderful day, and if we had more time in the city, I would have scheduled another tour, such as the music tour and wine tour. Andras is currently developing a new tour, regarding the Hungarian Soul, which we would do when we return to Budapest. Although prices are quoted in Euros, it's done simply as a reference point for tourists. Payment can be made in Forints. For reference, my sister and I are age 44 and 46 respectively. I'm a severe introvert and do not typically seek out such a highly personal tour as meeting strangers is not in my comfort zone. But this was an amazing experience and I cannot stress how glad I was to have done it. And I think the price is more than fair for the experience, and think it's actually low in price for what you get. This was an all day tour, after all, complete with the best meal you'll get in Budapest! Andras' love for his city and his willingness to talk openly about all aspects of life in Hungary, and his personal connection with his guests makes this a must-do for anyone visiting Budapest. DO NOT PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITY! You won't regret it!"

We talked about everything - from studying in Budapest, to dating (We learnt that Trabants are chick magnets) and his father was very humorous and accommodating as well.Although the cars are vintage, they are extremely well maintained and restored by Balazs and at no time did we feel unsafe or uncomfortable in the car.Thank you to Balazs, dad and three cars for hosting us so well.

Our tour guide Andras was a Budapest-born local who knew the city inside and out. The hidden treasures tour not only showed us a ton of \"off the beaten path\" locales but also contained a lot of very interesting history. The highlights of the walking portion were definitely the last surviving piece of the Jewish ghettos (in a gated community!), a ruin pub, and going to the historic coffee houses. The second part of a tour was a lunch at a Hungarian family's house. Here we had a wonderful lunch prepared by our hosts complete with wine and dessert! It was excellent and gave you a great taste of Hungarian home-cooking.We also went on the Danube bend tour with Andras. We visited three towns along the river where we could sample local cuisine and arts, walk through historic streets and churches, and pop into Slovakia for a picture! This day-tour was a lot of fun and had us in the scenic countryside of Hungary. The tour started with visiting a local ceramicist where she gave a demonstration and allowed us to work the wheel to make a bowl if we wished. It was really cool because it was a manual machine rather than an electric one. We also saw the largest church in Hungary and learned a lot about the history of the countryside as well. Each town has a unique history and it was great to learn about how the people lived in that region. The views of the Danube were breathtaking as well. We also were able to visit some mini-museums in the last town.We really recommend each of these tours to anyone visiting the country. It's a great opportunity to see and learn about Hungary from a local!"

Our guide was Balasz (not Gulash), a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable youg man with an extensive knowledge of the city and even more of Trabants and (communist) oldtimers. Balasz tailored the trip so we didn't revisit the places we'd seen on foot the previous day. Being driven around in a Trabant the size of a big cookie tin through the bustle of Budapest was a real hoot. Balasz is an excellent driver (visit his Facebook page and be surprised...!) and he knows the little cars inside out, we never felt unsafe. He gave us some interesting and good stories at various sites. We then had lunch at his parent's place - they are both very friendly people and his mother had cooked up a nice and traditional meal. For the afternoon, we switched cars to a very pretty Opel Rekord from the 50ies (I think), restored by Balasz himself and even more of an eyecatcher. It was a beautiful sunny day and we enjoyed every minute, visiting a few places off the beaten path. Balasz then dropped us off at a place of our choice. We heartily recommend the trip for Balasz' knowledge of the city, and if you are even a little interested in old cars, you'll come out of the trip as a Trabant-expert."

            "review": "Excellent Private Customized Tour. Our guide, Balazs, led us on the \"Hidden Treasures\" tour, as we had already visited most of the major sites of Budapest through our Viking River Cruise tour. Balazs showed us so many interesting out of the way places in the city and customized the tour per our requests. We rode on the subway & tram to various locations and stopped for coffee in a quaint little cafe. Balazs has an excellent knowledge of this wonderful city and we so enjoyed seeing the small flea market, alleyways, ruin bar, unique buildings, Jewish district and learning about the history & background of each. And we loved to learn about his Trabant, of which he is very proud. There were so many wonderful photo opportunities throughout the tour. We highly recommend My Personal Budapest and especially Balazs!"

Balazs is an engaging young man with a wonderful knowledge of Budapest, its history and the most interesting places to see and go. The highlight was driving in his 1966 Trabant, an East German era car which drew smiles and waves everywhere we went and it's much more comfortable than it first appears. This was a great way to get an introduction to both the Buda and Pest sides of the river in a short amount of time. Highly recommended!"

            "review": "Very Personal Tour with Wonderful Guides. I took a family trip with my parents, husband and two adult siblings in late April 2015. Based on good Tripadvisor reviews, I decided to book the Trabant (3 hours) and Danube Bend (8+ hours) tours with My Personal Budapest. The tour company was very accommodating, explaining that our group would have to be split into two cars (the vintage cars in which we would be travelling understandably cannot hold many people) and that a radio connecting both cars would ensure that everyone would be able to hear the guide. In most cases, you would be picked up at your door but because we stayed in such a central area with a busy, narrow road and no parking in front of the building, our guide, Bal\u00e1zs parked very close to where we stayed and we walked about 2-3 minutes to the waiting cars. This wasn't a problem at all, as it was ridiculously close, the weather was glorious and the walk took us by St Stephen's Basilica, which was just behind our accommodation.Bal\u00e1zs acted as our guide on both tours and his sheer enthusiasm and attentiveness was commendable. Bal\u00e1zs knowledge of the history and streets of Budapest (and the surrounding countryside) was impressive and he took pains to accommodate our little group's disparate interests and personalities. Whilst my siblings and I are easily accommodated, my mum has a bad hip and cannot walk far; my dad is abrupt and accentric, with a tendency to wander off on his own; and my husband has a short attention span. Bal\u00e1zs periodically checked to see if my mum was okay when we were walking around and kept tabs on everyone to ensure that no one got lost (people wandering off on their own, lagging behind to window shop or visiting restrooms). The tours were mainly memorable because we had a more personal, tailored introduction to the historic city. Bal\u00e1zs shared some local anecdotes and jokes, told us how locals live, explained Hungarian politics, showed us the neighbourhoods surrounding Budapest and gave us a thorough yet concise run-down of Hungarian/Budapest's history. We also travelled around in beautifully restored and maintained vintage cars - a Trabant and Opel. These drew admiration from many pedestrians and drivers alike and added a different dimension to our experience. It was also clear that Bal\u00e1zs was married to his cars! :)Although we were mainly driven around during the tours, we also had stops at scenic spots and places of interest, allowing us to take photos and have a closer look at various monuments/buildings/areas. It was perfect for mum especially.Bal\u00e1zs' dad acted as the second driver and also chipped in with little snippets of information about Budapest etc from time to time. He was a real gem, making hilarious statements and observations as we went along. Case in point - when we pointed out the Liberty Statue and asked about it, he noted that it was the \"world's biggest bottle opener\". So, not a fan of it, then. He was also a real old-school gentleman, as he made a point of helping all the ladies in and out of the cars and holding the door open for us (my husband would get out of the car and skip off like a lamb in spring, happily oblivious to anyone struggling with bags and heels behind him).Specific comments on the two different tours are as follows:1) Trabant Tour- At 3 hours, it's gives a brief overview of all the main sights and is perfect as a quick way to see the city, if you only have a couple of days. - I felt that it was a little too short to cover much in a fairly spread-out city with so many sights, like Budapest. As we had 5 days, I would've booked a longer city overview tour if it were an available option. I understand from Bal\u00e1zs that the company is considering the provision of a full day tour of the city, which I feel would be a better option.- Please note that you will not be entering the museums and cathedrals on this tour, so plan to do this on a different day, after you get the lay of the land from this tour. When we visited St Stephen's Basilica, we paid 200 Forints each to enter the church. We tried to see the mummified hand of King Stephen but it was housed in such a dark corner and the hand is so small that we couldn't see anything. You'll have to pay another 200 Forints to light up the reliquary for 2 minutes. Although this isn't much, we disagreed with the principle of it and just waited 1 minute for someone else to pay the fee (at which point, the group of tourists hanging around the reliquary started furiously snapping away on their cameras - no flash photography, of course).2) Danube Bend Tour- Simply amazing views. Highly recommended. Very relaxed trip for people who want to see very charming little towns with interesting architecture and the beautiful outdoors.- We got to visit Slovakia (very briefly) on this tour and to take some amazing photos. We also visited the largest cathedral in Hungary (Esztergom Basilica) - another breath-taking building; we were spoiled for choice!- There were sufficient water and restroom stops on both tours, so we never felt uncomfortable for a minute.- Lunch is not included on this tour but Bal\u00e1zs suggested that we could all have lunch together at a little cafe in Szentendre (a must-see), to try langos, a popular Hungarian fast food. It's a fluffy, deep-fried bread with optional toppings of sour cream and/or cheese and garlic spread. Langos is surprisingly light and not too greasy, my entire family enjoyed it. It was simply delicious, cheap and very filling!**Note: Although prices are quoted in Euros, this is just done as an easier reference point for tourists. Payment should be made in Forints.**Note: The vintage cars are a fantastic way to travel but you should know that they are 2-door and small, so it may not be as easy for senior citizens or bigger-sized people to get/fit into them. My family and I are small South-East Asians and my husband is 6 ft 2 inch, of a regular build. My husband was comfortable, sitting in the front passenger seat while my dad and I sat behind. There was just enough space for us, with our various bags and professional cameras. The experience of riding in these cars is incomparable though!Overall, I would recommend My Personal Budapest and Bal\u00e1zs (and his dad!) in a heartbeat. We got to know Bal\u00e1zs and his dad personally, while enjoying the sights and sounds of Budapest and the countryside. For us, it was the personal touch and human connection that made this entire trip memorable. We will definitely call on My Personal Budapest for future guided tours in Budapest."

Therefore a big part of the scheduled tour was already seen by us. Andras was quick to do a little revision of our tour and provided an excellent and interesting tour. I believe he included some the hidden treasures tour in our tour which was an added plus. His knowledge and love for Budapest is definitely reflected by his tour. You definitely get one of the city's best tour guides. We were really happy and enjoyed the tour immensely. The car, Trabant, it was fun and kind of exciting looking at all the people snapping pictures etc. but just be prepared for a very cramped ride. I enjoyed riding in the car and all of the gawkers were fun to watch but cramped. So just be prepared for this. Some have said it to be comfortable, I would not say that just fun and exciting. Budapest is a lovely city and Andras shared his knowledge. Fun day."

            "review": "Three great experiences.. Recently we had the pleasure of enjoying three tours with My Personal Budapest. Trabant tour: Our guide, Bal\u00e1zs, met us our first morning in Budapest in his Trabant for the Trabant tour. After getting an overview of the Trabant we headed out for a tour of the city including the Buda and Pest side. This was a great tour that allows you to get an idea how the city is laid out and what areas you may want to revisit. You also have several photo opportunities of the major sights. One of the best parts is observing the smiles on people's faces when they see the Trabant. Bal\u00e1zs is an energetic guide that provided us with a brief history of Budapest, a very helpful lesson on the Hungarian language, and other interesting facts throughout our journey. He also provided us with helpful restaurant recommendations at the conclusion of our tour. By the end of the tour we concur with his statement that you start off as guide and guest and end as friends.Szentendre and Hungarian lunch:On another day Atilla picked us up at our hotel for a tour to Szentendre and then to Andr\u00e1s\u2019 parents for a Hungarian lunch. Szentendre is a quaint town where we visited the marzipan museum, learned to make pottery which was a nice change of pace for us, and a unique artist\u2019s gallery featuring the smallest pieces of art we\u2019ve ever seen (Atilla was very excited to show us this gallery). We also had time to pop into a few stores to shop. Atilla graciously translated for us as we talked and chatted with shop owners.We then continued to Gizi and George's house (Andr\u00e1s\u2019 parents) where we were warmly greeted. Gizi fixed a delicious lunch for us, which we enjoyed over great conversation of food, family, pictures and travels. Throughout our lunch we felt like we had known them forever. I truly recommend joining them in their home if possible.Overall we were pleased with My Personal Budapest and recommend them. The set tours are a great way to get started. They are adaptable to requests and likes also. For instance, Bal\u00e1zs asked if we liked coffee to which the answer was yes, so he took us to one of his favorite coffee shops, since the Grand Market was closed that day. Communication was reliable with Andr\u00e1s while planning our tours. He was helpful in assisting with our requests."

The day began with a Trabant Tour of the the historical and cultural sites in Buda and Pest. We then had an amazing home cooked meal at Balazs' home in the countryside with Balazs' mother and father. And, we finished the day with the Hidden Gems tour. This tour was the highlight of our wonderful trip to Germany, Austria and Hungary. Balazs is an energetic and engaging young man, and his knowledge of Hungarian history and culture are absolutely amazing. His morning Trabant tour was the perfect introduction to the city, and his hidden gems tour in the afternoon was marvelous. We wandered through the back alleys of Pest, seeing some amazing sites, including the remnants of the wall the Nazis built to create the jewish ghetto and an introduction to the Hungarian Parliament. We paused for coffee and pastries at a quaint little coffee house off the beaten path. By the end of the day, we felt like Balazs was a member of the family. I would be remiss, however, if I did not say that the highlight of the day was the amazing meal his mother and father prepared for us in their lovely home. Mrs. Ackermann's hungarian cooking was as good as my grandmother's, and Mr. and Mrs. Ackermann made us feel so very welcome and comfortable in their home. I am so pleased we had a chance to meet and spend time with them. For those who may be apprehensive about visiting the Ackermanns in their home, throw off your inhibition. You will not regret it. I can't say enough positive things about this tour."

The next day we went with Balazs and his dad in their Trabants. Which are really fun retro cars. Besides the cars being fun we went on a 3 hr tour of the city. Balazs was so informative. We stopped at a number of places so that we could take pictures and enjoy the scenery. It was a really great way to learn about the city. Highly recommend this tour company on a trip to Budapest!"

He also gave us an insight into young peoples thoughts and views in this metropolitan area of Hungary.He took us high up on the Buda side to watch the sun go down and see all the lights come on either side of the Danube and along the bridges. His tours are very flexible, just let him know what you would like to do and he will arrange it for you. Highly recommended, we enjoyed every minute.

Like the Ruin Bar ( we visited this again the next day!), again with a full commentary of the area and its history. The walk to the Jewish Quarter was very humbling and to hear the full of history of what happened was very thought inspiring.

My two adult sons and I were visiting for three days, and I wanted a guide who would both take us to the city's \"hidden treasures\" -- the smaller places that aren't on the standard tourism maps -- and point out places and activities that would be fun for two recent college graduates on vacation. Andras gave us exactly what we wanted. Budapest has a slew of amazing cafes, and he took us to a great sampling -- the retro '60s, hipster TaskaRadio; the historic Central, and the magnificent cafe atop a bookstore that feels like a cathedral. We got a great look at some of the city's most distinctive buildings, including an exclusive rooftop view from the President Hotel; walked through the Jewish quarter; at lunch at the Central Market Hall, and visited the city's first and possibly best \"ruin bar\" -- the edgy, grafitti-covered Szimpla. We went back to Szimpla at night -- unforgettable.Andras gave us great pointers to the must-see tourist sites, Castle Hill, the Citadella, and gave us a rundown on the city's main swimming/bathing spas. He gave us great insight about culture, history and politics, and what it's really like to like in Budapest today. The tour was great fun in itself, but Andras also made it easy for us to get the most out of our other two days in Budapest. As a result, we had a wonderful time the entire trip. You can only scratch the surface in three days If we go back, I will most certainly take one of Andras' other tours."

It was a relief to not have to figure out where to go, first of all, and then how to get there. We'd been in Budapest last year and had already visited several of the typical tourist destinations.

I thought the price of the tour was very fair. All correspondences with Andr\u00e1s before and after we clear, quick and personable.

His classic mode of travel (Russian Trabant in the morning and his 1957 Opel in the afternoon) were head turners throughout the day.While a \"Hop On Hop Off\" would provide you an overview of the main sights of the city, I strongly suggest splurging a little for this trip that you will talk about for years to come. We chose the Trabant tour with lunch at Balazs' parents in a suburb 15 miles from center city and an off the beaten trail tour in the afternoon. Highlights included ghoulash soup and other authentic dishes with his very friendly parents, listening to Balasz share his passion and knowledge of Hungarian history and of course the cars. Friendly, professional and fun. You will not be disappointed."

We came in December, it was chilly, we were tired from flying and more than a little bit curios as to how we were going to see these great cities in only 2 days and then Bal\u00e1zs and his father pulled up in their Trabants.The crazy looking communist era cars caught more attention than if we had been zipping around Budapest in Italian sports cars. I'm a big guy, 6'4\" and even though it was a challenge getting in and out of the tiny cars once I was in I was comfortable.Bal\u00e1zs was an awesome guide and a fun guy who loves his city and took us to the spots we needed to see and then he dropped the real knowledge on us.The dude is a stunt driver who is well known for his ability to drive those Trabants around on 2 wheels, the videos are crazy, his stories are entertaining.Don't hesitate to take this tour, you have the opportunity to enjoy a great city quickly but make sure your guide keeps all 4 tires on the ground while you are in the car."

Exceptional, Andras and Balazs are exceptionally good guides,- the Trabants, the places we went to, conversations about history and cultures, good choices for places to eat .... it was all top quality. Bal\u00e1zs and his father drove us to a variety of sites in the Trabants. Traveling around in the Trabants was remarkable. The cars are beautifully maintained and quite comfortable, though small which is part of the historical experience. However, driving in the small, two cylinder cars gave me an appreciation for the life in Hungary during the years of Soviet control, as contrasted to my life in the US during the same period of time. The Trabant tour, part of which was going to the park of Soviet statues and monuments, was a lifetime memory. Bal\u00e1zs and his father were so friendly, very polite, and the conversations spanned a thousands years from the begining of Hungarian history to the present. We loved the Trabants and Balazs. I would recommend this as a great part of our trip. We also toured Budapest on foot with Andr\u00e1s. Budapest is a beautiful city, and Andras took us to unique sites, historical coffee shops, and unique cultural experiences which we would never have experienced without him as our guide. That was all on foot. Then, we took a day with Andras and toured out into the country side to eat great traditional Hungarian food, take back street tours of little towns, see historical sites, and share time with artist friends of Andras, and again have a day full of great, friendly, conversations about history, culture, and just laughter and good times.  I am so thankful to have Andras, and Balazs as our guides. I will remember them and their parents kindness for decades."

Unless you have a car, public transport touring is slow and whilst the metro is easy, it doesn't go everywhere. Andr\u00e1s was our guide and it was his parents who hosted us lunch. We took a half day car tour followed by Hungarian lunch, then a \"hidden treasures\" half-day tour the following day. His knowledge reflects his love for this city and wandering with Andr\u00e1s around back streets, caf\u00e9 haunts, Turkish baths and quiet gardens added to our experience of how local Hungarians relax. Of course the car tour allowed us to see sentinel attractions, including the castle and the markets. Some were seen driving past, others we walked past, and major sights, we toured through. Other museums (e.g. National Gallery, Hospital in the Rock and House of Terror), Andr\u00e1s encouraged us to go by ourselves due to time constraints, which we did later. It was an excellent way to experience Budapest in 2 days and we enjoyed the hospitality of his family at the lunch. His mother cooks traditional dishes very well and whilst Andr\u00e1s' English is excellent, we enjoyed conversing with his folks who were surprisingly interested in live outside Hungary and were happy to share their insights into life in Hungary in the past and today. Unlike bus tours, or hop-on-hop-off touring, this private tour offers insight and a personal experience. Highly recommended."

On our European 16 day multi-country journey we had only one whirlwind day to spend in Budapest, so we contacted Andras to show us his city. My only regret is that we didn't spend two or three days touring with him. He showed us ALL the major sights of Budapest, gave us a great history lesson and explained the culture of his people while driving us around the city in his car. I don't know how he fit so much into such a short period of time. He picked us up from the train station at 10:00 a.m. and dropped us off directly at our train station at around 5:00 p.m. I can't believe we were able to see so much and do so much in only 7 hours! He is fluent in English so language was no problem at all. If you are ever in Budapest, the absolute BEST thing you could do is retain the services of Andras as your personal guide to explore this wonderful city. It was definitely the highlight of our entire trip. If I ever return to Budapest (and I surely hope I do) I will be sending Andras an e-mail to arrange for his wonderful guidance."

We had such a difficult time choosing between the tours Andras described on his website so we picked 4 of them to fill our 2 full days in Buda and Pest. First, we did the driving tour of the city sights in the Trabant car. That was an amazing way to see the cities and feel like you were part of its history. Next, we did a walking tour of the hidden gems and saw parts of the city that most visitors to the city couldn't find on their own. Absolutely, lovely. The next day, we visited two potters' workshop in a nearby city called Szentendere, where we had the opportunity to use the potters wheel and make a bowl! Way cool! Due to rain, we adjusted our plans and did some fabulous shopping in Szentendere where Andras was able to direct us to the best merchants for what we were looking for. A trip to the miniature museum was also a great find where we saw the smallest bottle of coke and other objects of art that can only be seen through a microscope. Andras was professional, informative, sensitive, and very personable and we thoroughly enjoyed these 3 tours with him. The last tour was so special and made us feel as if we truly felt like a native there. Andras' parents, who are warm, charming people, welcomed us into their home and shared a traditional, delicious home-made meal with us. That really made our trip complete. We highly recommend you have Andras show you his cities for a truly unforgettable experience."

We learnt a lot about the rich history and culture of the Hungarians (Andras know the history so well and makes it interesting!), we laughed a lot!, and it was such a fun and engaging afternoon. I would definitely recommend this as a great way to see Budapest."

Happily we chose Andras to show us the part of Hungary we would not have seen if we stayed in Budapest. We started our day with a visit to the artist village of Szentendre. There was an opportunity to try our hand at pottery. Laszlo, the potter, made it look so easy, but you needed coordination and strength. He guided us through the whole process and we each made a creation.The highlight for me was dinner at the home of Andras's parents. We were warmly welcomed and treated so well we didn't want to leave. Our meal of chicken paprikash was outstanding. I had requested that meal since my Hungarian grandmother made it for me. Andras and his parents were helpful in showing me on a map the town where my ancestors came from, Nyiregyhaza. What a thrill to see my maiden name in print. I highly recommend My Personal Budapest Tours. It was a day I will always remember."

They turned up promptly at 9am as they said they would and although the Tribants were a little cosy they certainly drew a lot of attention and were a fantastic way to see Budapest. As there were 6 of us we had two cars and a walkie talkie was set up between the two cars so we could hear the commentary from the front car. Nothing was too much trouble and they completely catered for us all - he was still asking us at 7pm if there was anywhere else we wanted to go! Definitely good value for money. Borash was very knowledgeable and his enthusiasm and passion for his home country was infectious. We had a fabulous lunch and they even got us a bottle of champagne as they knew we were there celebrating a birthday. Nothing was too much trouble and we all agreed that it was the best day of the trip. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see the sights of Budapest without having to endure huge tour groups and want to do something a bit different"

The afternoon was spent in Etyek having a leisurely lunch and touring a family-owned wine seller and enjoying a small wine-tasting.

He handled all of the tickets/admissions for us so we didn't have to do anything. It was great to see things off the beaten path.We especially liked the view from the top of the President's Hotel!

For several months we had been in ongoing email contact with Andras and had booked two tours back to back -- the walking tour and the lunch in a private home (his parents' home). So we were a little concerned when he wrote that a family wedding would take him away from the city when we were there -- and also mean no lunch at his parents' home since they too were attending the wedding. Of course, we understood completely that family comes first. In any case, there was no need to worry. His colleague Attila took over our walking tour and he was an outstanding guide -- low-key but very knowledgable and with a good sense of humor. We loved going to places that we never would have found on our own, or even with the average tour guide. Several were open only to this tour operation; e.g., a rooftop with spectacular views and a private palace owned and lived in for centuries by the family of Hungary's first president.I had been to Budapest several times before but this was the first visit for the other three family members in our group. For all four of us, it was a very special experience. We highly recommend this tour group for a unique look at a remarkable city -- whether you are a first-time visitor or here after repeated stays.After the tour, we treated Atilla to lunch at Diszno (Pig Bistro), a restaurant recommended to him by Andras, and it was excellent (see separate review).

So beautiful, and there is no other way we would have ever known about this. Attila also navigated the intense traffic and parking challenges with ease. He was also kind enough to sit through lunch with us at the New York Cafe, which is not to be missed. We were able to see all the items on our wishlist.

Our time here was limited, so we had booked a tour with Andras, and so glad we did! He took us on a city tour, followed by lunch at his parents' home. What a treat! She used paprikas to add a different and delicious flavor to the food. Her strawberry torte, yum. His fathers garden was lovely as we'll. next was the Hernyak Birtok winery. This was a great change of pace from the city. The owners are beautiful and hard working. They believe in quality over quantity, and you can taste that belief in their wine. See review. Andreas' knowledge, along with his pleasant, easy manner mad our day one to remember!"

We chose the three-hour city tour of Budapest, followed by lunch at Andras' charming parents' house, and ended with an out-of-town winery tour. It was clear we should have planned to stay a few days more in Budapest. It is a charming city and Andras' love of his home city made us appreciate it all the more. Knowledgeable about Budapest and Hungary, Andras' presentation was entertaining and kept us chuckling at his sense of humor. We saw so much more than we would have ever found on our own. The Hungarian lunch Andras' mother fixed was delicious! She identified it as stuffed cabbage but I would have characterized it as a soup with shredded cabbage, wonderfully seasoned broth, and lamb-pork meatballs that melted in your mouth. The strawberry-whipped cream-cake for dessert finished off a terrific authentic Hungarian meal, making us feel more like company than tourists.The family winery we toured was about an hour-and-a-half drive out of Budapest. As the miles of rolled by, we were delighted by the countryside. Valerie, the wine-maker, told the story of how the family bought the land and began their winery after the Communists left. After educating us on what it takes to make a good wine, she gave us samples of five different wines to taste. We sat on the winery patio, sipping excellent wine, eating locally-made cheeses and other treats, while gazing at the rolling hills of grape-vines. As enchanting as Italian vineyards or Sonoma in the U.S., this is a place not to be missed.When we think of Budapest, it is this wonderful day that comes to mind. Do yourself a favor and book Andras' (or his colleagues) for a unique experience you can't get anywhere else!"

For the lunch, Andras's mother cooked a big meal and served it to us in her home. The food was really good and she made extra for me since I'm a vegetarian. It was much more interesting to be a guest in a real family's home than to go to a typical restaurant. The Danube Bend tour was also great - we visited an old castle which you could walk through and see amazing views of the Danube. We liked the other parts of the tour too but these were our favorites. I would recommend My Personal Budapest to anyone visiting the area."

We saw a lot, and he adjusted some stops to accommodate our needs. We saw so much, that we see no need to do our other planned tours. The lunch at his parents house was wonderful. The appetizers and meal was good.... But the Apple Struedel for dessert was absolutely wonderful.... It could be served in any 5 star restaurant. Balazs and his family were very welcoming, and very enjoyable to be with.... Book this tour... You will not be disappointed"

We lucked out big time with Andras from My Personal Budapest. On day one we did a tour in [2] old Trabants that were in mint condition. The drivers were a father and son duo that made us feel right at home. Touring Budapest in these unique classic cars made the tour that much more exciting. Andras was well versed in Hungarian history and did an excellent job of keeping the tour on a level that was interesting not only for my wife and I, but also for my 23 year old son and 21 year old daughter. One stop on the tour was to the Marketplace where we tasted some excellent Palinka and strudel. Day two we did a walking tour to see some off the beaten path spots that you would not find on your own. For lunch, Andras took us to a friends home for a home cooked Hungarian meal. Upon entering his friend's apartment, we were immediately made to feel like family. I can not stop raving about the delicious meal that we ate. My kids are picky eaters and they both loved it. At lunch, our host had offered us home made Palinka that was out of this world.What more can I say, Andras is the real deal and will and will make you feel right at home in Budapest!"

Booked a few months before our visit with Andras and had expected to have 2 trabants as some need a driver and guide and there were 3 of us and no way would 5 of you fit in a Trabant! When we were met at our hotel bang on 9 oclock I was delighted to find we had only the one, and what a fab little car it was. Balasz (pronounced bollarge), a 24 year old expert in these cars who has rebuilt several of these old vehicles proudly showed us the one he was driving that day, talked about how it works and showed us the engine and explained how he had done it up. He was so enthusiastic and engaging, lovely start to our day. We had booked 2 tours, the general tour of Budapest for the morning and the hidden gems. After a busy day I dont think we left anything out - he took us everywhere - spas, old buildings, ruin pubs, fantastic lunch cafe with good local food, castle area, parliament area, Jewish area, all the bridges. The whole time telling us about these places and their history. Highlight for me though was to go onto the roof of an hotel and see the view of the city from their helipad. You would not find that on most tours! Such a unique way to see the city, I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone. High praise for Balasz, his great little car and his unending energy and enthusiasm."

We set off on a morning tour to see the highlights of Buda and Pest. Balasz is an amazing tour guide with a fun and witty sense of humor and expert knowledge about his beautiful city/country. His English language skills are impeccable! He shared a tremendous amount of information during our tour and even took us for coffee at one of his favorite cafes. We had booked the winery tour for the afternoon. The vineyard was about 30 minutes outside the city and traveling through the beautiful Hungarian countryside in the Trabant was definitely a real treat! We were greeted at the winery by the owners and made to feel right at home as we sampled wines from the vineyard and a enjoyed a wonderful spread of tapas prepared for us. It was a wonderful way to be introduced to the beautiful city of Budapest and I highly recommend My Personal Budapest Tours!"

If you want to go off the beaten path, experience the real Budapest and stay off the \"touristy\" sites, Andras is your man. You will find yourself on a helipad atop a hotel;viewing the remains of the ghetto wall from WWII, in coffee houses with Art Deco museums in their basement. He is well informed, organized, loves his Budapest and wants visitors to learn about its history. Without a doubt our day with Andras and Ackerman was the highlight of our two week Viking River Cruise."

We took the Hidden Treasures tour with Balasz, in his Opel, and it truly was amazing. Balasz is a very personable young man, who displays incredible knowledge and love for his country (and cars). He showed us truly amazing gems that we never, never would have found on our own, which made Budapest and her people come alive for us. Hands down favorite for me though was the lunch with Andrasz's parents, who are the loveliest and most gracious hosts. The food was amazing and Balasz was perfect as the translator. We exchanged many stories about our families, children and cultures. We met as strangers but left as friends. Please, please, please give yourself a gift and take this tour as an opportunity to learn more about a country and her people than you will ever learn from a museum. Scott and Liz from Boston."

Forget the pre-packaged bus tours and phone Apps, the personal tour we had with Balazs was extraordinary. It started outside our hotel where the Trabant was parked next to a Maserati and a BMW, yet it was the little Trabant that received all the attention from the passing crowds and with good reason. The car was immaculately maintained and very clean on the inside and riding through the streets of Budapest in this was an experience in itself. Balazs took us to some of the lesser known sights of Budapest and apologized that he couldn't show us anymore because we were scheduled to fly home that same day. If we had known we would have been doing it a day earlier. Our guide's English was excellent and his demeanor was so chirpy it made you feel secure and happy at all times. His access to some of the areas of the city was incredible and we got vistas that were unparalleled. A better photographer would have had a field day. We took as many photos as we could. The knowledge of the city was superb and he was able to answer every question. In conclusion I would wholly recommenced this experience and would love to see this kind of service replicated across other cities."

This allowed us to return to what interested us in the following days. He then took us to lunch at his parents' house. His mother prepared an amazing Hungarian meal and we really enjoyed their warm hospitality. Finally he took us to the Etyak wine region where we toured the Hernyak Winery and sampled their wines which included another amazing plate of local cheeses and cured meats. The quality of the wines were a nice surprise! We are frequent visitors to the Napa & Sonoma regions and enjoy finding and drinking small batch premium quality wines. We did not expect to find such amazing wine in Hungary and now we wish we could find these wines in our part of the world. It seems that Hungary keeps most of it to themselves.We highly recommend starting your first trip to Budapest with a tour from Andr\u00e1s and even if it is not your first time he still has much to offer. If we get the opportunity to return to Budapest we would hire him again and challenge him to provide another unique tour experience."

Although we tended to ask a lot of questions and going off at various tangents, not only about the tour but about Hungarian life in general, he kept the talking and walking flowing very well. Three hours passed like three minutes and we would have loved to have spent more time with him, but as we couldn't, he gladly pointed out further areas of interest on our map and recommended some other things to do. One of which is to try to get lost in Budapest, a recommendation we accepted as we stumbled across some wonderful children's craft festival in the castle district and the lovely Olympic park by the Parliament.

I'm not really one generally for looking inside car engines but I even found that interesting!Balazs told us and showed us how he had 'pimped' AOX to include a unique sun roof, horn and easily lifting front seat to enable minimal effort in getting into the back seat ! The subsequent tour was funny and fascinating! We learnt a great deal and despite our Brummie/Midlands accents, I think Balazs learnt a little from us too! His English was better than a lot of English people I know!! Balazs also tailored the tour for us after we advised him that we wanted to incorporate an element of the 'Hidden Budapest' tour. He took us to a wonderful coffee house which we would never have found otherwise! When we eventually arrived at the Hungarian home for the traditional meal which formed the 2nd part of our booked tours, we had only just over an hour to sample the delights and hospitality here. This was entirely our fault and I think on reflection we should have asked for a an earlier hotel pick up ! We loved the food and the experience however, and the airport drop-off afterwards was an excellent value-for-money extra which was very much appreciated and much more fun than a mini-bus or taxi transfer !!Our thanks go to Balazs, to Andras and to Andras's parents for making the day so memorable!!

Also got us where we needed to be on time, took us to some nice places for coffee etc and was good on when we could visit other areas we had not had time for. His English is superb too. Really excellent overall."

He and his driver showed us all the major sites, we had a very nice lunch, visited two of his favorite cafes for tea and coffee. We were very pleased with the tour, the service, the competence. We loved riding around in the Trabant antique car. We highly recommend Andras."

First we met our tour guide Balazs at our hotel and he introduced us to his fabulous Trabant retro style car which we would be travelling in for the first part of the tour! Such a cool funny looking car, felt like we had been transported back in time ! He gave us the lowdown on the history of this car and also that he restores them in his spare time.so nice to see his passion and pride for something that he loves to do and also that he could make a living from it!We went to the five main attractions, he parked up, we walked around took pictures and spoke about the landmarks. After he took us to a beautiful cafe for coffee with antiques adorning the walls and ceiling! That was pretty cool.Would never have found otherwise. Then it was on to our second tour of the day where we met with another tour advisor Attlia, as we were being taken to a charming little arty town north of Budapest called Szentendre! We were thought how to make pottery first, then we walked the cobble lock streets of this gorgeous town admiring the old churches and houses while Attila spoke about its history. He then took us to a marzipan museum! This was the business! Later he took us to an authentic Hungarian restaurant where we ate smokin hot goulash! We barely came up for air..! Another jazzy looking interior. After all that it was time to drive back to Budapest and get ready for our dinner boat cruise on the Danube! A four course meal with live music so relaxing and perfect to finish our busy day. Although we were still full from the goulash so we practically rolled off the boat on our bellies lol Big Thanks to Balazs and Attila for the wonderful day on our private tour! You made our trip :) Love love love Budapest! Hope to return in summer time next!"

The Christmas market in Budapest was in full swing and we loved walking and touring the city landmarks and attractions on our own but we did spend one very enjoyable afternoon with Balazs from \"My Personal Budapest\". It was our favorite time as Balazs took us to many behind the scenes places that tourists do not frequent. Our tour included both walking and public transportation to get from place to place so except for the fact that my husband carried a camera and we kept looking up at the buildings we felt like we were blending into the culture. We started out on a helopad with a 360 view of both Buda and Pest and a view of a gorgeous tile roof that could not be seen from the street. We covered numerous sites including the last remaining portion of the Jewish Ghetto wall from WWII and a unique ruin pub. Balazs was knowledgeable, personable and was a pleasure to have as a tour guide. I highly recommend this tour company and especially this tour for a unique experience to anyone visiting Budapest."

It has the perfect combination of beatiful location, impressive buildings and plenty of attractions and cozy restaurants to enjoy a perfect weekend. But the best choice was to meet Andr\u00e1s, who, during a full day, showed his beloved city with true passion, excellent knowledge and very good sense of humour. We really felt like being guided by a friend . We took the combination of Trabant Tour ( great fun in the smallest car you can imagine), Hidden Treasures ( you could never find the atractions he shows) and Home Lunch ( great food at the home of his lovely parents). It was a wonderful experience, can only reccommend this tour and we will for sure trust Andr\u00e1s in a future visit to Hungary.For Spanish visitors, Andr\u00e1s does not speak Spanish, but his English is perfect and very easy to understand, even if you are not fluent in the language."

Andr\u00e1s picked us up at our hotel, we were five minutes early downstairs, but he was waiting for us. He gave us an overview of our day and then we were off. A lovely breakfast in a spot we never would have found on our own, with fresh coffee, then we were off for many hidden gems, a huge lunch, a river cruise, and the best strudel I've ever had. Throughout the day he suggested other things we could do on our own as well. All of this was included in the low price of the tour. He was FANTASTIC with our boys ages 14 and 11 and involved them throughout the day. When we come back we will definitely book another tour with Andr\u00e1s."

He was a very gracious host.

The early fog cleared for us to enjoy coffee on the lakeside and lunch in Tihany. Andras is an exceptionally pleasant guide and was comfortable to answer any questions. For us, this gave us great insight into the past, current and future situations faced by Hungary. We could read a history book about Balaton Fured, but our enduring memory is imagining the happy reunification of German families there who had been tragically torn apart by the communist regime (Hungary was the only country that East Germans could travel to during the cold war). If we are able to travel to Europe again, Hungary would be top of our list to revisit. Thanks Andras!"

Andr\u00e1s took us to some excellent restaurants serving delicious local cuisine, and he recommended numerous places to visit on our own the next day. Two days later we met again to take the Danube Bend tour which was so much more! We enjoyed a visit with a lovely ceramics teacher and tried our hand at making a pot.

Attila swung by theJewish quarter and even though I was not able to see the inside of the synagogue, he gave me a glimpse, something my tour did not deliver. We shared lunch at a wonderful art nouveau cafe, explored Alexandra book store's three levels and secrets, and at my request even stopped at a great shoe store whose brand is hard to find in US.

At each stop along our route Attila not only showed us points of interest, but also told us the history of the place. The last stop of day was at a family owned winery. This was icing on the cake!

            "review": "Fabulous Day in Budapest!. We recently went to Budapest for a weekend break from London. Never having been to the city, and with only two days to spend, we wanted to maximize our time and see/do as much as possible. After reading the reviews for MyPersonalBudapest on TripAdvisor, we decided to book a full day out - the Trabant tour, the home lunch, and the Hidden Treasures tour.Balazs picked us up from our hotel in the Trabant, which was very convenient and great fun! We spent the morning exploring the \"main\" sights of Budapest. We peppered Balazs with a LOT of questions about the history of Budapest, past and present, and were very impressed with how knowledgeable he was! Not only was he knowledgable, but he was also very personable. We really enjoyed hearing about Budapest from a local's perspective, discussing the differences between our cultures, and generally just having a laugh!! It was a gorgeous day out, so Balazs was able to put the top down on his Trabant. This was really fun!We then headed out for the home lunch. The hosts were fabulous, welcoming us into their homes and sharing some DELICIOUS Hungarian food with us. We got to meet others who were on Attila's tour, and had a delicious lunch full of laughs with our tour guides and hosts. We really enjoyed this, and could barely get fit back in the Trabant after lunch because we were so full! We thought that the homemade lunch was a great break between the morning and afternoon tours, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, the delicious meal, and the great company. In the afternoon, we continued on with the Hidden Treasures tour. We went to a variety of sights, relaxed with a coffee in a really neat coffee shop with Communist-era decor, took in some great views, and had a really nice afternoon. Overall, Balazs was a fantastic tour guide. We felt that the tour was well worth the money spent, and commented many times throughout the day how grateful we were not to be on a generic bus tour with 60 other people crowding to hear the guide talk. The personal touches were absolutely fantastic, and we really felt that we came away with a much stronger sense of Budapest, it's people, and it's history.Thanks for a very memorable tour!"

He showed us the \"hidden treasures\" of the city, where typical tour groups may not get to visit. Because of such, it made it that much more memorable. We enjoyed having Attila as our guide. He showed us cafes, museums, bookstore, art gallery, and more. It was raining the morning we had his tour, and we had to miss one stop where one could see the beautiful rooftop of a former bank. To our surprise, as soon as we got back to our hotel, he was already on his way to bring us some refund money because we missed that place. We appreciate his honesty. He also said he had a transit day pass for our family when we first met in the morning. But we already had our pass, and forgot to ask him for his so we could use it the next day."

Andras spoke intelligently with information about Budapest I thought he would not know. I also had a great deal of fun talking with Balazs about his pride and joy, the Trabants, and also about 60s and 70s muscle cars of which he was surprisingly knowledgeable given his young years. I also did the culinary tour and enjoyed Andas' selections of delicious meals and snacks. His hidden treasures tour was also very worthwile, and because of my time limitations we weaved that tour into the others for an entremely enjoyable and informative tour. I highly recommend this tour. DO IT!"

This quirky little car was an attraction itself! Andras showed us the highlights of Buda and Pest, but most impressive was his historical knowledge and deep appreciation of Hungarian culture. I felt as though we not only had a guide, but someone who truly loved his city and heritage. The tour ended with a delightful in-home lunch with Agi, who prepared a lovely traditional meal. The second day, we took the Danube Bend tour with Attila. The visit to the three villages was a perfect counterpart to the tour of Budapest. Atilla was also very well versed in Hungarian history and added so much to each site, castle, ruin and church we visited. I think any of the tours offered by My Personal Budapest would make your visit to Budapest even more special."

However, if you can only do 2 days, I would highly recommend combining these two days as we did for a perfect Budapest experience. Andras, and his trusty driver, Bolesz, in his vintage (and immaculate Trabant), took us all over Budapest to see the major sights the first morning. WIth the open top of the car we were able to enjoy the beautiful buildings all around us. For lunch we had booked his special \"lunch with the locals\" and that couldn't have been better! Excellent food and a nice chance to relax with local Hungarians. (However, if you are a cook, Agnes has her own tour that would take you to the market to shop, then you return to her apartment to cook the food...next time!) We returned to our hotel anticipating the next day's trip to the countryside...what a fantastic day it was! As usual, Andras had booked perfect weather for us. We drove to their large lake, Lake Balaton, which is a beautiful blue with assorted resort villages dotting it all over. However, he took us to what must have been the most beautiful town to sit for a coffee next to a marina, then walked along the shore, saw their famous Cardiac Hospital, and then continued on to the peninsula village of Tihany where I could have spent quite a few hours. We saw the Benedictine Abbey, bits of the village, and then continued on to the Istvandy winery which was the perfect end to the day. Andras had arranged our lunch and wine tasting which was wonderful in every way...we didn't want to go home! Andras was the best, most personable, private guide we have ever used. His knowledge of history, architecture, music, etc. and where to take you to allow you to feel the heartbeat of Hungary is superb. If you can have two days with him, do the city tours (whatever ones you want) but make sure to visit the countryside for a day, too. The two days combined gave us a great appreciation for this country."

I had wanted a food tour, but no need to schedule it, there was so much good food included in the tour that I never expected, that it really was a two day food tour in addition to everything else. We did a two day tour. The first day we saw some important sites in Budapest, including the Szechenyi Baths, Chain Bridge, Buda Castle, Citadel, and more. Later we had lunch in Andras' family home. This is an experience you can't get anywhere else. Not only was his family lovely and gracious, but the food was very enjoyable and plentiful. From there we went to a lovely winery where we were fed again. The winemakers were a husband and wife team, their presentation was personal and informative. I will never forget that experience as well. The second day we saw off-the-beaten-trail sites in Budapest: good views, hidden ceiling paintings, the Ruin bar (another highlight, we had the bar to ourselves and the whole place is full of hidden works of art and other ingenious things), and more. Later we walked around ourselves and realized how close all these things are together, but without a guide it would take a lot more time to see so much. In fact, most of the highly rated things on Trip Advisor seemed to have been on our tour. The day started at a fascinating local market with a beautiful meat and cheese plate but we didn't expect it so we'd already eaten breakfast. My husband had a coffee he described as the best he'd had in his life. We also had lunch at a restaurant Pesti Diszno, which turns out to be a restaurant written about in the New York Times with excellent Trip Advisor reviews, we tried three soups (my husband and I shared two) and three main dishes, all very tasty and typically Hungarian. We then had delicious warm pastries at First Strudel House. All of these snacks, admissions, and transportation were included in our tour, which I didn't expect.My only hesitation for giving five stars is that Andras, who is pictured, was not our guide. He is the A list and I didn't realize we wouldn't have him. We had Attilla, who was thoughtful and attentive, he just lacked the gift of gab that you would expect a tour guide to have. Several times I felt that he didn't seem to have enough information to impart and that it was more a string of facts rather than story telling. Several times I felt the conversation got too involved in our jobs and finances, subjects I found especially uncomfortable because of our respective countries' financial disparities. We did really like Attila, and we certainly learned a lot about Hungarian life from him, I just think there's some room for improvement.I highly recommend using My Personal Budapest, though I think the company's name and promo photo may be misleading. This was an unforgettable tour."

We took this tour during one of the hottest days of the year in Budapest (101F) - and still enjoyed it very much. So, yes, that's how good it is.We combined the main sights + culinary tour since it did not make sense in my opinion to try to squeeze the main sights tour between breakfast and late lunch. I strongly recommend you do that since everything flows better. We had breakfast at a local market and already started talking about Budapest history, recent events, etc. Then we went for the main sights tour. Everything was covered and questions answered without rush, at a very relaxed pace.One small improvement suggestion for larger groups. We were in two Trabants (cars) and used a radio to communicate between stops. But the radios used are not very clear and the group in the second car sometimes would not properly understand the guide's observations. Therefore clearer radios or some other solution would be better for larger groups.All in all highly recommended."

After telling him we were interested in bakeries he re-shaped the day to take in some of his local favourites, translating for us, and guiding us on some of the delicious products for sale. This was entirely above-and-beyond our basic requirements, and showed that he is very willing to go the extra mile for clients. The Trabant was a great attraction, and our driver was a charming man. Despite being rather tall people, we all fitted in easily enough. The personalised piano concert was the highlight for my partner.

            "review": "The best way to explore Budapest and the Danube River towns. My husband and I just returned from a two week trip to Amsterdam, Prague, and Budapest. The two days that we spent with Attila from MyPersonalBudapest were among the best days of our trip. I began by emailing Andras to create itineraries for two days. Initially, I wanted to tour Budapest on Sunday and do the Danube River Bend Tour on Monday. Andras suggested that we switch our tours around as many places such as the Great Market in Budapest are closed on Sunday and we'd miss out. After several emails, our days were set.On the first day, Attila met us at the apartment which we were renting. He was prompt and arrived in his personal car which was clean and well maintained. At first we thought Attila was a bit reserved and quiet, but we were quite wrong (in a good way!) He spoke perfect English and had a great sense of humor, offering us terrific insights into the way of life of Hungarians. Attila taught us a great deal of history filled with anecdotes along the way. Clearly, he has a great love and pride of his native Hungary.We took off to do the Danube River Bend tour and Attila was kind enough to search for an ATM for us on the way, even standing nearby and watching as we used the machine. Our first stop was Szentendre. We arrived early in the morning, just as everything was opening, with few tourists around. Attila asked what kind of art we enjoyed (as this is an artist's town) and took us to the shops that reflected our interests. We enjoyed the winding, narrow roads and Attila's explanation of why they were built that way. (I'll let him explain that to you.) The shops were lovely and Attila was patient as both my husband and I took a multitude of photos and browsed to see if there were items which we wanted to buy. We went into a beautiful old Serbian Orthodox church and Atttila explained the customs and history, while giving us tips on Hungarian pronunciation! We then went into the Szabo Marzipan Museum, which was quite interesting! (All tickets were included in the price that Andras had set.) From there we went on to the town of Visegrad, where we saw a castle and breathtaking views of the Danube and the river valley. Next, we traveled to Esztergom, where we visited a stunning cathedral. Below the castle was a restaurant where we ate a delicious French lunch (as it was Bastille Day). (Lunch was at our own expense, which had been explained previously.) As it was Sunday, there was a mass in the cathedral and Attila told us that we must hear the organ play, but he was not certain when it would begin. As we walked outside, admiring the view, Attila repeatedly checked inside for us to see when the organ playing would begin. He ushered us in right on time and it was indeed splendid. I'll also add that Attila was quite helpful in showing my husband and I spots to take the best photos from. It was an informative, relaxing day that we just loved, and we would recommend this the Danube Bend tour highly. We almost took a bus tour and are so glad that we did not. Oh, and we even drove into Slovakia to see the view of Hungary from there! Very cool!On the next day, Monday, Attila met us again at 9AM and brought us around the corner to where Balazs had his Trabant parked. What a lovely young man and what a fun car! He actually made the top into a convertible by himself. Balazs gave us a great explanation about the history of the car model and my husband had fun looking at the engine with him and comparing it to the Volkswagen Bugs that he had long ago.The morning was spent with Balazs driving and Attila guiding. The banter between them made the ride even more fun. We saw great sights (you can read about them in the previous reviews - I had read all 180 of them before booking this tour, which Attila found hard to believe, but it was true!) and once again, Attila was a wealth of information and so pleasant to be with. We never felt rushed at all.We went back to Attila's car, said goodbye to Balazs, and then hopped back into Attila's car for a drive to the countryside to have lunch with Andras's parents. They were lovely, welcoming us with Palinka and appetizers, and then serving a delicous lunch of vegetable soup, Lecso (stew) and roasted chicken, followed by raspberry cake.We headed back to Budapest, dropped off the car, and took public transportation to see the Hidden Treasures of Budapest, including a ruin bar which I requested that Attila take us to. I'll add that I had mentioned in my email to Andras that I was a bit concerned about too much walking due to a foot injury, and Attila offered to drive us for the afternoon tour to lessen the walking that we'd have to do. Fortunately, that was not necessary, but Attila's kindness and concern were evident. The Hidden Treasures tour was fun (we were a bit tired by then but we did enjoy it) and we saw places that we never would have found on our own. Andras clearly has good connections, even enabling Attila to get us into a famous mansion on a day that it was formally closed!By the time we were dropped off at our apartment at day's end, we felt like we had made a good friend and were sorry to say goodbye after our two days! I'd highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting the delightful city of Budapest. Best regards to Attila, and I do hope you find what you are looking for. ;)"

After explaining the details of his Trabant, we piled into the car and were off ! There is no finer way to see the city then with a local tour guide who was charming and very attentive. After seeing the sites, we booked the hidden treasures tour for the afternoon. It is amazing what you can see if you are not trying to figure out where you are on a map and what to do next. Balazs lead us around. It was a great day and truly the highlight of our trip. Thanks Balazs for making the day so memorable and special ! If traveling to Budapest - use this service - you will be smiling for weeks with great memories !"

I was a little worried at first when I read all of the great reviews of andaras and then found out we would have a different guide because he was busy. Fears were unfounded as BalazsI was exceptional. Great knowledge, inquisitive, fun, caring, warm and friendly. I love taking personal tours because you can have great conversations about the region, culture, history and of course, restaurant and other recommendations. These guys are great. The trabant tour was so fun and the sights memorable."

Only a few moments after meeting Andras in out hotel, we felt comfortable in his company and eager to embark on a custom-designed tour of the Danube bend, complete with a wine-tasting in the afternoon. The people you meet on this tour - including, of course, Andras - are what makes the day so memorable. We will never forget shaping our first clay bowl under the expert guidance and encouragement of Gabrielle. Smiling, vibrant Gabrielle. Every moment spent with Andras - strolling through the cobbled streets of Szetendre, gazing at the flooded Danube from a scenic overlook, or simply driving from place to place - was filled with open, intense, and sometimes even philosophical conversation. In itself, a rarity in these days of superficiality. Yet again, during the wine-tasting, the encounter with Valerie was so genuine. Filled with admiration for what she and her husband had created in less than 20 years following their escape from Serbia, we felt moved by her tale. Another person along our way whom we will always remember. I mustn't omit the mention of the delicious cold plate we were served, the good wines we tasted and the exclusive hilly location of their vineyards. It was a day - and three very special people - to remember!"

Honestly, Andras has given me such a fresh view of Budapest...My husband and I were in Budapest for less than 2 days in May. We had arranged 3 tours together with Andras: Trabant tour in the morning, Hungarian lunch in a Hungarian home, and The hidden treasures of Budapest. The total cost was 220 euros. I initially thought it was a little pricy, but trust me, at the end of the day, I felt it was totally worth it!The tour with personal, had a very nice pace, and was tailored to our interest. The Trabant tour was fun and took us to a lot of places that would have taken too long to get to by foot. I particulary loved the lunch because it was intimate and really gave me a sense of how locals live their lives. Not to mention that the lunch was so yummy because it was made by a lovely professional chef! The afternoon walk tour was relaxing. Andras took us to a lot of local places that tourist would have never discovered. Additionally, we were able to ride the subway and the bus, and take a little break here and there in the market or charming cafteria.What more can I say? If you ever consider a tour in Budapest, this is it! You won't find anything better than this. Perphaps I will go back for another tour with my family some day..."

Andr\u00e1s realized we had quite a few things planned and offered getting us tickets for the river cruise so we wouldn't have to worry about that. He planned a great 3h-tour, which perfectly fit in our schedule so we were able to catch the ship right on time. Coming down to the lobby of our hotel, Bal\u00e1zs - a true Trabant enthusiast - already expected us and first held a quick history lesson about Trabant cars. The tour took us to the most important sights of Budapest with Bal\u00e1zs pointing out a few hidden treasures we would need to check out later during our trip. Throughout the tour we were frequently asked if there was anything else we wanted to see but we laid our full trust into Bal\u00e1zs' experience as a guide and we weren't disappointed. The Trabant-Tour was absolutely fantastic and it was definitely a highlight during our stay in Budapest. On a side note: Bal\u00e1zs is an extraordinary driver and very passionate about his Trabant. You will enjoy listening to him and the stunts he's performing with his car! :)One remark: If you know what sights or special locations you want to visit, you might as well tell them in advance. I am sure they will set up an individual trip for you."

The afternoon ended with a visit to a small winery overlooking the lake. Breathtaking! The food at the winery is outstanding, the best meal we had during our entire trip. The wines were wonderful and the view is unbeatable. Overall a picturesque and relaxing afternoon. If you have the time, definitely add this to your itinerary.

            "review": "Hidden Treasures Tour. One thing that I have found to be consistent with the tours we have taken (my partner researches these on Tripadvisor , among other sites) is that each guide-the good ones-bring a little of themselves to the picture. They cannot help it-they are in this business because of their own curiosity, their love of history and their city or country and their desire to share that with others. That being said, we have been very lucky to get the guides we have. Andras is polite, deferential, really, really smart and knowledgeable. He is interested in what you want to know, and guides his tours that way, answering questions thoughtfully and thoroughly. He met us at our hotel mid morning and came back with us when the tour was over. Since this was a tour for two people, there was time to stop for something to eat or to go to the bathroom. It's a city tour, so shoes for walking in the city are good to wear.The tour we took is aptly named \"Hidden Treasures.\" Andras grew up in Budapest, in Pest, and so he is familiar with many places known only to locals. We would never have found many of these places on our own, and in fact, had never even heard of some of them. The Karolyi Gardens and Palace, the first stop on the tour, was a perfect example. A beautiful park, part of the former estate of the Karolyi family, it is easily passed by as its entrance is small and unprepossessing. Once through the small gated entry, it's lovely. Andras took us through the estate and the history of the place and the family beautifully.His love for the city, and for these places in particular was evident. The Central Bookstore and Alexandra bookstore are on the tour as well as the statue of Ronald Reagan - right across from the Soviet monument! And there's a wreck of a building turned into a hopping night spot, kosher bakeries and one of the most hidden highlights on the tour was the Post Office!Had we not taken this tour we would have walked past some of the most beautiful and interesting sights in Budapest, never knowing of their existence! It was well worth the morning. We had a wonderful time."

It turned out to be Balazs, our Trabant driver, showing the car to local workers and explaining how it works. My husband was immediately in heaven, as he has quite a love for old cars. Attila, our guide, arrived and we were off for our adventurous Trabant tour. Both Attila and Balazs were very knowledgeable and entertaining and great to spend the morning with. They showed us various sights throughout the city and explained the history and politics behind it all. So many beautiful things to see-Heroes Square, the baths, Parliament, Chain Bridge, Buda, Fisherman's Bastion,Matthias Church,the Liberation Monument, not to mention the magnificent views from the Buda side. As the homemade hungarian lunch was not available on the day of our tour, after the Trabant tour, Balazs dropped us off at Trofea for a buffet lunch which featured many Hungarian specialties. Attila explained the various dishes to us and we were able to sample many foods. After lunch, we began the The Hidden Treasures tour, beginning in the Jewish Ghetto. We walked, rode on streetcars, and traveled on the subway and saw all forms of architecture, parks, a palace, restaurants with interesting decor, the view from the rooftop of a hotel, went shopping, and had a great overall view of Budapest along with the wonderful companionship of Attila. The entire day was a great adventure and the tours are highly recommended."

It was a bit awkward for the three of us getting in and out of the Trabi, but it was relatively roomy (I've been far more squashed up on some airlines!). Our guide (Bal\u00e1zs) was brilliant, even though we had already explored the city on foot, he was able to tell us so much history about the buildings and statues and the country. We visited all the most noteable places, had plenty of stops to walk around, and of course, lots of time bombing around the city in the Trabi.Bal\u00e1zs was able to answer any questions we had, and took us to one or two of the more hidden gems of the city, away from the usual tourist treck. The driving was very safe - from a very skilled driver, if you are lucky enough to have Bal\u00e1zs as your driver, make sure you check out his youtube videos of Trabant driving skills! Is this really the best rated trip in Budapest? It's the only way to see Budapest!!Thank you very much :)"

My mother, sister and I booked the Trabant tour and family lunch with Andras (at short notice) and had the most amazing day out ever. My mother (in her seventies) was a little alarmed when she first saw the two Trabants that were arranged for us (somehow I imagined we would all be travelling in one - silly me!), but after a few explanations from Andras and his colleagues, she felt completely at ease. We packed a great deal of sight-seeing into the morning tour and Andras even amended it slightly to avoid some stair climbing, which my mother didn't feel able to manage. All the while we had a running commentary of all things Hungarian, from history to politics to cuisine. We stopped off at a lovely, Art Nouveau cafe in the center of town and ended up at Andras' parents' house for a delicious Hungarian lunch. Even though his mother didn't speak any English and his father's English was limited, we had a marvellous time and loved the feeling of getting to know some real Hungarian people. We also had a quick shot of traditional plum brandy, which just about shut down my nervous system. An acquired taste for sure!Spurred on by the success of our first tour, we ordered another tour later in the week to Szentendere and Viesgrad and this time our tour guide was Atila. This was another fabulous day out. Atila is a font of knowledge on all manner of things and we enjoyed getting to know him and chatting through the day. He was a joy to be with and nothing was too much trouble for him, as he tried to work out which area would have the best view and where the clouds might be. We even saw some storks on their nest (first time for me). I felt very sorry when the day was over and we had to say goodbye. If you are in any doubt about what to do in Budapest, look no further than Andras and his team. What a bunch of fantastic young professionals. We will certainly use them again on our next trip to Budapest."

Andras showed us the layout of the city so that we were able to go back and revisit certain places such as the Szenchenyi Baths and the Great Market Hall. Lunch at Andras house was so much fun. We met two other ladies on vacation who also spoke English. Andras mother and father did not speak much english but they were very kind and genuine and his mother was kind enough to cook me a whole separate meal simply because I am vegetarian. By doing the lunch we got to see an area just outside the city we would have never gone to by ourselves. Andras was very accommodating with my grandmothers needs and even adjusted the price of our tour when she opted out of some things even though we had booked them in advance. He clearly trusts his customers alot. It was very refreshing to speak to a Hungarian tour guide who knew so much about his country and also a hunger to learn about me and my country. Attila took us to Szentendre and even though it was snowing all day we had a good time with him because he told great stories and made us laugh. He too seemed eager to engage in conversation and not just spit facts at us. We saw a wild boar! We went to Lake Balaton and Istvandy winery, both of which were beautiful even in the snow. Daniel, who greeted us at the winery, was warm and inviting. He was very casual and funny. We had an absolutely amazing meal (again I was specially treated with a wonderful risotto dish because of my vegetarianism) cooked by his girlfriend Czilla. Their guesthouse was in a pretty rural town and was absolutely luxurious. I only wish we could have stayed there a few more days! I will never forget our tour with mypersonalbudapest and I know my grandmother feels the same.

It was an amazing experience for me because our family had a Trabant very long time ago (so I had some flash backs...) and for my partner, too, because he has not yet seen a Trabant from the inside, not even speaking about riding one. We were picked up by Balazs and Andras at our hotel and were driven to interesting locations in the city, that we knew very little about. Budapest has so many hidden corners and even for someone who speaks Hungarian and lived there for years (many years ago) it is very hard to keep up with all the happenings, new places and old / hidden treasures.We wholeheartedly can recommend this fun tour to anyone - even to locals! - who prefer to get true insider knowledge by excellent local guides, who love what they do. What we appreciated the most was really the mix of the places we visited that were off the beaten path and of course the sweet Trabant, that Balazs (owner of a Trabant collection) has proudly showed to us - the highlight was to have a look at the engine area... very special indeed! :)"

Szentendre was such a lovely town and Andras did a fantastic job showing us around. My husband and daughter had a fun time making pottery and enjoyed talking with owners of the pottery business. Then Andras took us to the winery. We had such a great time. The owners of the winery were such pleasant people and we enjoyed learning more about making wine. They gave us a delicious meal and we sampled their wines. It was excellent. Thank you Andras, Balazs and Balazs for making our trip to Budapest so much fun."

            "review": "\"Loved every minute!\". My 18-year-old daughter and I decided to take a side trip to Budapest during a recent stay in Austria, and with only 30 hours in the city, we wanted to really maximize our time. Andr\u00e1s did a fantastic job customizing our day, which included touring around in a Trabant in the morning, lunching at his parents' house, and spending the afternoon visiting a winery in the countryside outside of the city. He was very professional and prompt in his e-mail communications prior to our arrival, suggesting that we might prefer the winery visit when he learned we are students of wine. We loved riding in the very cool Trabant and found Bal\u00e1zs, the owner/driver, really delightful company. It was a treat to be able to get out and walk around at our various stops in Buda and Pest and not have to worry about parking! We got kind of attached to that little car and were sad to see it drive off when that part of our tour was over. Lunch with Andr\u00e1s's mom and dad was not only really delicious, but the experience satisfied that part of us that loves to get past being tourists and see how people really live. They were so sweet and welcoming! We left feeling we had made new friends despite the language barrier (Andr\u00e1s was great at translating for us - it was never awkward). We could tell his parents genuinely enjoy meeting and feeding Andr\u00e1s's guests. Our trip out to Etyek to visit the Herny\u00e1k winery was of particular interest to us, as we got to see the Hungarian countryside and taste Hungarian wines with the winemaker. The meat and cheese plate we were served there was a tasty ending to our day. As Andr\u00e1s drove us back to Budapest to the train station, we asked him to help with our Hungarian wine pronunciation. Now that's a video! Andr\u00e1s is a warm, open, flexible, knowledgeable, interested and interesting guide with a fun sense of humor - a super companion for the day. We were very well taken care of, and will definitely tour with him again the next time we are able to get to Budapest!"

He was very communicative over email when we were arranging the date of our excursion and what we wanted to do. The tour is really as advertised, customized and personalized. We started the day off with the Hidden Treasures tour. Got to see part of the old ghetto wall, an old aristocratic home and even walked around on the buda side. Some of the hidden treasures were unfortunately not available to us because of the weather but Andr\u00e1s did a great job of improvising.Then we stopped for lunch with his lovely parents! His mom made the BEST hungarian goulash as one of our courses! So glad she made it for us as I would have left Budapest without having tasted the best goulash in town! His dad is super sweet! Overall I have to say having lunch with them was one of my favourite experiences on the tour. We then went to a small winery a few minutes out side of the city and met a really lovely family and tasted many good wines. Again, it was a very small winery but the quality of the wine was really quite good! And because they are so small something you would not have access to outside of Budapest. Really it would have been a missed experienced had we not added the wine package to the tour. Overall the day was well spent getting to know Budapest like a local! Also loved getting a little bit outside of the city and seeing one of the smaller towns where the winery was. Thank you so much to Andras! You honestly made our trip. Thank you for accommodating us on a Sunday as well! We will definitely come to see you again when we are back in your lovely country!"

My partner and I spent a good three and a half hours with Andr\u00e1s (guide) and Bal\u00e1zs (driver) touring around Budapest and seeing the main sights - not to mention getting some stunning photos! It is a superb way to see the city - not only is it different (the trabant cars are really something!) but it also serves as a great introduction; the rest of your trip becomes much easier to plan. You know where everything is, and you know what you want to go back to. I could not recommend this activity highly enough - Andr\u00e1s and Bal\u00e1zs are lovely (their passion for their city and country knows no bounds, and the sheer extent of their knowledge is just incredible); it's very reasonably priced; and it's definitely something to remember and talk about for years to come. The MyPersonalBudapest website is very user-friendly, Andr\u00e1s responds to any and all requests quickly and efficiently, and they pick you up from your hotel and drop you in a place of your choosing. If you pick one 'tour' to embark upon in Budapest, make it this one. We will definitely use them when we go again and would recommend them to anybody and everybody. Thank you Andr\u00e1s and Bal\u00e1zs for showing us your wonderful city - we'll be back! Helen and Dan."

This did not adversely affect our day, which was very informative, entertaining and done at a good pace with many good stop off points. As part of the tour we did his \"hidden Budapest\" and he was able to take us to places we would probably not have found on our own. We also took advantage of his somewhat unique experience of lunch at his family home and a chance to meet his parents which was a delight and something we will long remember. You can book tours with Andras with confidence of a professional service from a very knowledgable young man who understands and speaks English very well.

We really felt like we were seeing the true Budapest as we had breakfast and lunch in wonderful local restaurants. We strolled large avenues and then little alleys, seeing parts of Budapest that I bet are not seen by other tourists .

He picked us up from our rented apartment and whisked us away to the Castle. We had never been to Budapest before and this was a fantastic introduction. Andras' tour was full of interesting and personal stories that highlighted the rich history of Budapest. He was extremely knowledgeable about the city and its history. We were able to pick out the attractions we wanted to return to and really planned our entire visit based on what we saw on the tour. Andras went out of his way to ensure that we saw as much as we wanted and really got a feel for the city. Riding in the trabants was an unexpected treasure. It was such a unique experience and I loved the quizzical and excited stares from onlookers. I really felt like we were a part of the city riding around town in the small cars. My favorite part of the tour was the hidden treasures Andras brought us to. Beautiful panoramic views and coffee house gems are just a few of the unknown attractions Andras showed us. We were fortunate enough to be able to have lunch with Andras' parents. I cannot fully describe what a wonderful experience this was. His parents graciously welcomed us into their home and cooked us a huge and delicious traditional Hungarian meal. It was hands down the best meal we had in Budapest. The language barrier was forgotten as we toasted together and told each other about ourselves, with Andras translating of course. This is an absolute must for anyone visiting Budapest! We are frequent travelers to Europe and have never been on such a great tour before. Andras really personalizes the tour and makes this foreign city feel like a home away from home. I highly recommend Andras' tour and would go on it again!"

The first full day, we did the Trabant tour, with Janos driving, and saw many beautiful places we could never have gotten to on our own. Then, we went to Andras' parents' home for a delicious home-cooked meal. I wish I could stay with his mom for a while and learn how to cook the way she does! The day was capped off with a private recital in the apartment of Adam Filegi. My husband and I are both musicians, and really appreciated the opportunity for such an intimate performance. Mr. Filegi is very friendly and an excellent pianist.It is very rare in any city to have the opportunity to visit people in their homes, and we got two visits in one day. On another day, we did the hidden treasures of Budapest, with many places we had never heard of, even with all of the pre-trip reading we did. Especially moving was the little piece of the wall of the Jewish Ghetto. Then, we went into the wine country for a private tasting. It was such a treat to be in the countryside on an autumn day and look out at the vineyards, then head inside the Hernyak Winery for some delicious wine and light snacks. The family who run the winery were friendly, and we learned a lot about how wine is produced. I know a lot of people think they can find everything on the internet, and that private guides are beyond their budget, but I would argue that every forint we spent was worth it. Budapest is a very large city, and it takes a personal guide to figure out the logistics and organize tours to make perfect days like the 2 days we spent with Andras. He is very popular, so if you are interested, you should contact him as soon as you know your dates."

We had Attila Kiss for our guide and he was a perfect fit. He was very friendly and knowledgeable about Budapest. We started off with the Trabant tour. I felt like more of a tour attraction with all the looks and pictures taken of us. Saw great sites and pictureous views around the city. The ride alone was a great time. Then Attila took us to a great Hungarian buffet, so we could taste numerous Hungarian dishes. Great suggestion Attila! ;-) Then it was off to the \"Hidden Treasures of Budapest\" portion of the tour. We took the subway, bus and walked all over the wonderful city learning the interesting history. Took us on a private tour of a mansion via a good friend of his with a kind heart. Learned so much of the WWII and Communist history that it opened my eyes to so much more sadness and terror that once bled through the streets of this city. I thank Tripadvisor for such a great recommendation and I thank Attila Kiss for such a great tour. Will look you up again when I come back. Thanks"

He is also very knowledgeable about the history of the Trabant. We learned much from him today. The day began with a driving tour up to the Fishermans Bastion. Spectacular architecture and views of Budapest...pronounced Budapesht...from there we drove across Chain Bridge around the Parliament building. Gorgeous! Many stops along the way to take advantage of the picture opportunities. Attila has a very keen sense of good photographs...he has an artistic flair and helped us capture true Budapest. We met Gisela and George who prepared a fantastic Hungarian lunch for us in their home. They made us feel like we were family. Very warm people! Lots of laughs! We then returned to the city and began our walking tour. There are many hidden treasures within Budapest that we would never had seen without our very knowledgable guide. If you are coming to this beautiful city do yourself a favour and look up My Personal Budapest. You will not be disappointed."

            "review": "The best way to visit Budapest in two days. Andras provides the perfect way to see Budapest and the Danube Bend in two days. For the first day, we took the Trabant tour of the city. The Trabant is a Soviet era car that was manufactured in East Germany. It is very rare in Budapest today, and wherever we went, we felt like rock stars with people flocking around the little cars and taking photos. Andras rode in one of the two cars and communicated with the other via radio as we toured many of the important sites of this beautiful city, the Paris of the East. The two men who drove the cars were great also. One of them does trick driving shows in his car and will be glad to share the YouTube videos he has made. The day concluded wonderfully at the house of Andras's parents where we enjoyed a delicious traditional Hungarian meal prepared by his parents in their home; like Andras they are very gracious and personable, and we learned so much about life in Hungary today and in the past. In a short time we feel that we made friends for life.On the second day, Andras drove us to three towns on the Danube bend north of Budapest: Esztergom, Visegrad and Szentendre . These towns contain much of the history, culture and beauty of Hungary. We took the one-hour boat ride back to the city from Szentendre.Andras is a wonderful young man and through his eyes and guidance you will learn first hand about his city and its life. His tour is very deserving of its number one rating on Trip Advisor."

We booked Andras on our last day in Budapest, we thought we've seen most sights, and we wanted to go light and perhaps some off the beaten tracks away from tourists. This day became our most memorable day, Andras' tour is not a tour, it is an experience, and a truly unique one. Andras took time to find out where we've visited, so we would not visit the same place. Bringing us to the backlanes of Jewish Quarters, toured a historic bathhouse, enjoyed the best coffee at a grand cafe that was once a casino, rounding off this perfectly paced tour with a home cooked lunch that beat the best of Budapest restaurants. Any friends/readers thinking of Budapest in a day, you won't be disappointed."

My family of 5 just got back from a holiday in Budapest. We all had such a wonderful time. Since we were traveling with elderly parents and my 4-yr old son, we especially requested him to make sure we don't do too much walking so he drove us around in a private van and made sure our special requests were met. He was so nice and we appreciate his warm hospitality. I highly recommend his tour! "

Andras was our personal guide around one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Our day started with the Trabant tour. While waiting for Andras, Boulash (sic) the driver and loving owner of the Trabant explained the intricacies of the 2 stroke engine from the past. In this communist relic we visited all the normal tourist spots. Andras is passionate about his city and has every right to be so. We were able to discuss some historical facts and this seemed to impress Andras and the more he engaged on each and every subject.The second part of the tour was a Hungarian lunch at the home of his parents. This was a highlight of our tour. A lovely couple and in true Hungarian style made us most welcome.In the afternoon we visited sights that the normal tourist would never see. These I will not explain as it would spoil the surprise for those who subsequently take this tour.We took these tours on our first day in Budapest and during the next three days visited attactions pointed out by Andras. MypersonalBudapest tours are great value for money. We are returning to Budapest, probably next year and will again use Andras."

Our tour guide was Atilla who looked after us for two tours which took up a whole day.We started with a Trabant tour, where you squeeze into a delightful little car and see the all the major sights around Budapest. This would be something to do on your first or second day, as you'll then know where you want to visit again on your own.After lunch we headed off, this time in Atilla's car for a visit to an historic town about an hour out of Budapest. It was great to see a part of Hungary other than just the capital city.The fellows who own this business have an obvious love for their country and love showing it off to tourists. You won't go wrong if you get them to show you around."

Everytime we were back in the car he was deep in discussion with the very pleasant English speaking driver about \"Car things\". Andras found a lovely street cafe for lunch and in the afternoon we did the \"Places left out of Guidebooks\" tour. We really enjoyed this tour which was a combination of walking and riding on the subway. Andras was both knowledgable and passionate about Budapest and its history. His contacts allowed us into places you would never find on your own. I recommend buying a 24 hour subway pass as we used ours sailing the next day on the Danube River. It was a very pleasant way to spend several hours."

Everywhere we went - the Travant attracted lots of attention - which was also very fun - we waved and said hello to everyone.Focusing on the tour's information - it is obvious that Andras is passionate about not only Budapest, but also his country. He has great knowledge about the city and he was equally passionate about sharing it with us. After the Trabant tour - we went to his parent's house - where we had the best meal! His parents are lovely and the food was absolutely fabulous. The wine was great too. After lunch - we drove back to the city and did a 3 hour walking tour of hidden treasures. Even though it was almost 100 degrees outside - we still had a great time talking and walking throughout the city. We took the subway twice - and so that was neat.

The wine in Hungry is fabulous !Carol Sullivan"

The Trabant rides with Janos and Balazs, the father and son team of drivers driving to the sites was a kick! People all over the city would stop and stare at the little cars. The lunch at his Father and Mothers house was top notch, as were the Novak's. Very warm and hospitable, with the food and drink as good as it gets. Then, a trip to the countryside for the wine tasting, at the Hernyak Wine Estates, which was absolutely amazing. Both the wine and cheese plate, along with the winery owner's tour and knowledge, was worth the price of Andras tour alone. Superb wine. I wouldn't see Budapest any other way after meeting and getting to know Andras. He truly cares that you see the city he obviously loves in the best possible way, and every facet of this tour was delivered in the most professional, yet friendly and engaging manner. My wife and I came away feeling we had made a good friend in Andras. And, most importantly, Andras is of the highest character. He adjusted our rate down after another traveler joined us, a great Kiwi, which we wouldn't have thought was even necessary, but that is the type of person Andras is. The Best! Do this tour!"

So, we decided to do this tour which included 3 hours of riding around beautiful Budapest in a Communist-era Trabant, then a home-cooked lunch in a Hungarian home. The whole thing was awesome and well worth it! My husband and I joined with a group of six ladies for the tour. We had three Trabants in all, each with a driver. Our tour guide, Andr\u00e1s, rode in one Trabant and communicated via walkie talkie with the other two during our tour. Couldn't have asked for a better guide! He was knowledgeable, professional, organized, personal, and fun. He speaks excellent English and German, so no worries there. We were driven to most of the highlights of Budapest, and we got out and walked around with Andr\u00e1s at most of the points of interest. There was ample time and opportunity for picture taking. After the tour, we were driven to Andr\u00e1s' parents' house for lunch. They were the sweetest and most hospitable people. The food was homemade by Andr\u00e1s' mother while Andr\u00e1s' and his father entertained us. First we had a toast with our choice of Unicum and/or Palinka (two must-try spirits of Hungary) along with appetizers of salami and pepper on bread. Then we stuffed ourselves with homemade goulash because (1) it was delicious and (2) we thought that was the only main course. Imagine our surprise when Andr\u00e1s' mother brought out a second dish of pasta with bacon and ricotta chesse! Trust me, it tasted much better than it sounds. We were already full, but the pasta dish proved to be equally delicious and irresistible, so we made room. Then there was dessert! Hungarian pancakes, similar to French cr\u00eapes, filled with walnuts and chocolate. After so much interesting sightseeing, great food, and enjoyable conversation with both Andr\u00e1s, his parents, and our fellow tourists, all we could manage for the afternoon was a nap! My husband and I both highly recommend Andr\u00e1s and MyPersonalBudapest, even for those of you who, like us, do not normally consider group tours. It was a perfect complement to our own personal exploration of Budapest."

We hired Andras to escort us to the Lake Balaton region on Saturday, May 12,2012. The region was a true gem. We arrived in time to see all the sailboats celebrate the beginning of the sailing season. We were taken to the peninsula of the Lake where Andras escorted us to a local winery. It was very evident that Andras had a unique relationship with the family that owned the property. We were treated like family. We were exposed to a cornucopia of local sausages and fresh vegetables for lunch. Our group was given a sampling of 5 wines made at the winery. The wines were exceptional. The winery went out of their way to accommodate the one vegetarian in our group with a delicious cheese platter and home made potato pancakes. This dining experience was the highlight of our trip. We spent 4 hours eating, drinking, laughing and enjoying the beautiful vistas afforded us at the winery. Andras treated us like we were members of his own family. Upon returning to Budapest Andras went out of his way to make our stay even more enjoyable. We were taken to a local ice cream shop where we purchased some of the local treats. Andras found out that even though we had been in Budapest for a few days we had not been to the Citadel... the highest point in Budapest where one can see the vastness of Budapest. The Citadel stop was not part of our tour but Andras felt it was important for us to experience this amazing panoramic view of the city. What was to be a 8 hour tour turned out to be a 9+ hour tour. All of us agreed that this tour was truly a highlight of our trip to Budapest and would not hesitate to recommend Andras as a tour guide for any of his wonderful tour excursions in Budapest."

He tailored the tour for us and we saw everything from Buda to the markets,the baths and those hidden cafes...just to mention a few of our stops. We enjoyed Andras' engaging style and I'll share just a little hint here: the answer to every question about Budapest is ...1896 (the year of their millenium celebration).We continued the tour by travelling about fifteen minutes to his parents' home where we were put at ease by their warm and gracious welcome. My compliments go to Andras' mother who prepared a traditional Hungarian meal that was absolutely exceptional.Thank you Andras for a wonderful and very memorable day in Budapest."

We spent the whole day with Andras which included two tours and a delicious traditional Hungarian lunch. I was quite nervous before hand, especially having lunch in someone's house, as I thought it may be awkward but it was the complete opposite. We were made to feel very welcome, we had a great time and the food was wonderful especially the Chicken Paprika which awas my favourite, however Agnes' mums homemade pickles were a very close second they were delicious . The two tours we had with Andras were briliant. We were taken in two Traband cars to the main tourist sites on both sides of the river - Andras was lovely he spoke great english and gave us a fantastic tour. I was in the second car which had radio contact while on the road but our Driver Janos also spoke english very well and was very entertaining too. Budapest is truley breathtaking. After lunch we went on the hidden treasures tour, this was a walking tour which along with many other amazing things included a visit to a Palace which was stunning and my favourite part of the tour. Andras hired a guide to take us through some of the rooms which were amazing to see. Great value and the best way to see the sites. They day past so quick. I would advise anyone going to Budapest to see the sites this way it was a great experience. Thanks Andras and friends. Debby"

I was travelling with two friends and we were initially a bit apprehensive. Our apprehension was totally put to rest when we met Andras. He is a very charming guide with very good English and a manner that put us at ease. It felt like having a tour with a friend. He is a very knowledgeable individual and we saw many sites that we would not have found on our own. We started by being taken around Budapest in two trabant cars driven by father and son Balazs and Janos, the cars attracted quite a lot of attention which was very amusing for us. We then went to the home of Agnes where she prepared a traditional Hungarian lunch, initially we were unsure about this but the meal was lovely and had even prepared a vegetarian option for me,again we were immediately put at ease by Andras and Agnes and we had a nice and relaxing lunch. Andras then took us on the metro to visit many more sites with the hidden treasures tours, they were certainly treasures as they were things that you would not have found on your own,the market,ghetto wall, ruin pub and many more.These tours are a must and definitely value for money. I can't wait to visit again with my family next year and I will definitely be organising one or two of the many tours that \"mypersonalbudapest\" tours offer. Thank you again Andras for a truly wonderful Budapest experience."

We visited the charming little towns of Szentendre, Visegrad, and Esztrogom, had a fanastic lunch in underground the restaurant operated by the church in Esztrogom. Andras combined a great mix of the present, historical, and local flavor for a great day. We finished the day with a wine tasting in Etyek with a cold plate dinner of Hungarian delights. It was the best tour we had during our 3 weeks in Europe. We would certainly recommend to anyone spending time in Budapest to book a tour with Andras Novak."

Being of Hungarian descent, we loved the food and the company. Andras' mother cooked a meal that was just like what my grandmother used to cook, and I know my mother enjoyed the Hungarian conversation (do not let this deter you though - Andras also speaks perfect English). We truly felt as though we were among family and were sad to have to leave! This isn't like the cookie-cutter bus tours that you see all over Budapest.

The entire trip was outstanding but - the highlight of the entire two weeks was the day we spent with Andras in Budapest. We could not have asked for a more pleasant and knowledgeable guide. Andras customized a tour for nine of us which was full of information and attractions from 9 am to 10 pm. Had we been smart, we would have booked a second day with him although the information he provided us with on the first day did enable us to navigate well on our own the second day. The lunch served by Andras' mother was the best food we had throughout our trip and the hospitality of Andras' father could not have been more welcoming. The evening tour and dinner at a winery outside of Budapest provided another wonderful meal and the opportunity to see some of the countryside outside of Budapest. I have been reaping the benefits of travelers by reading through Trip Advisor information for years (I found Andras through Trip Advisor) and never thought I had any thing excellent enough to fully recommend. So, for my first post on Trip Advisor, if you are going to Budapest, be sure to include Andras Novak in your plans. www.mypersonalbudapest.com Ellen Stephen, Greer, SC: Ken Baerwalde, Ft. Mill, SC"

            "review": "The Best Tour You Could Ever Wish For. My wife and I booked a tour with Andras. We couldn't have asked for a better tour and had a fanstatic time. Andras was a man of faith, intregity, and professionalism and had a vast and deep knowledge of Budapest, ranging from the 100's to 1,000's years of history, to the Nazi's, to the Communist, and then onto more modern times. Andras met us at our hotel right on time and arranged for a trubant (sp?) to take us around. If you're like me, you may not know what a trubant is, well, it's a east German car. It's very tiny and was a blast driving around Budapest in to see all the major sights. Andras' driver was excellent and knew how to manuver around the city in such a way where we were never delayed and it was truly door to door service. He would drop us off at a site and when we were done, he would be waiting for us, so we didn't waste any time waiting around. We spent the entire morning driving to all the main attractions on the Pest side and then onto the Bud side of Budapest. The architure and vibe of the city is magnificent. We really only had one full day to see Budapest and it is quite spread out, and Andras took us places where we would have never been able to see on our own (from a time perspective, as well as just not knowing where certain things were). Some of the highlights of the tour included the Opera House, Parilment, City Park (where the thermal baths are a unique experience in and of themselves), we drove by mansion after mansion on the Andrassy Bouvlvard, visted a very grand, quaint, and charming coffee house, the Bud side castle or palace, the beautiful cathederal, Fisherman's Banstion & the Citadell (where the view of Pest was breathtaking). We couldn't have had a better time. That was only the morning part of our tour. Around 1PM Andras took us to his parents house for lunch. His parents were warm, loving and simply delightful and made you feel right at home. The lunch was excellent. We started off with a Tarragon Chicken soup with dumplings (we each had at least 2 - 3 bowls of it because it was so good), baked chicken and roasted duck with a nice sauce, paprika potates that were out of this world, and purple cabbage. It was authentic and wonderful lunch. Then it was out to the garden for some homemade apple strudel. Everything was top notch and we just fell in love with his whole family. Then it was off for the treasure hunt. I hadn't really thought about what it entailed, but when we left his parents house he they gave us a questionaire and Andras drove us back to Bud and had us go out and expolre the city on our own for severl hours and meet back up with him at the coffee shop we went to in the morning. The treasure hunt took us through Bud and Pest and we learned more and more about this beautiful city. We ended up on the bus, trams, and the metro. By the end of the treasure hunt we felt like we really knew our way around city and really got to experience it. After we met up with Andras at the coffeeshop and talked about our adventures, he then took us to a Ruin Bar (because I wasn't really sure what one was, but had read a bit about them in some tour books or on-line). We'll it was a great way to end the day because it was one of the most eclectic and unique bars I have ever been to in my life. It had a lot of art and fun stuff througout the place. It is hard to explain so you'll just need book a tour with Andras and experince it for yourself. Our day with Andras was probably one of the most enjoyable days of our vacation and believe me we went to some pretty amazing places througout Poland, Hungary and the Czek Republic. If you're going to Budapest make sure you book a tour with Andras because he'll make sure you have the best time of your life!! It was simply amazing!!! Doug Hope & MariluzArlington, Texas"

Since we joined the segway tour already, which covered the inner pest area, we then asked Andras to arrange for us to see Buda areas instead. During the morning, we went to castle hill, margit island, galert hotel and spa, fisherman's bastion, and mathias church, also saw the budapest palace on the way up the hill. Then we had lunch at Andras parent's place (his mom cooks delicious hungrarian cuisines!), it was our friends birthday, so we asked if andras could arrange for a cake and we will pay him, however, he said it was free of charge, and a gift from them to us! How lovely. Then after that we opted for the 10 hidden places to visit which are not mentioned in the guide books. Overall the experience was good, especially the lunch, the BUDA visit in the morning was a bit rush as we wanted to see a lot in a short hour, Id say skip margit island. And visit PEST area with Andras would be a better option rather than doing the 10 hidden places. Some places we visited was a bit draggy, however we loved the cafes visit, very unique indeed. And the tour guide who was with us (Attila, a friend of andras) was very good, he dropped us at the shoes of danube and waited for us as requested (he worked over time!) - this place is a must visit, especially towards the evening when lights are lit up - breathtaking!

We were in the city from Philadelphia to visit our children who are living in Budapest for the next two years. From the beginning, we could tell how knowledgeable Andras was. He took us to the former Jewish ghetto and surrounding sites. We also discussed resent Jewish life before entering the grand synagogue for a separate tour of the sanctuary and the museum. While the snow and cold somewhat limited our \"outside\" walking, it did not hinder an otherwise great day. We took every advantage of the tour, including a wonderful \"authentic\" Hungarian lunch with Andras and his family. We were made to feel as if we were old friends - terrific food and interesting conversation, with Andres serving as guide/son/translator, shifting roles as required. After lunch, it was back in the car to resume the tour. The afternoon provided us with a rich experience, as the weather improved enough for us to take full advantage of all the major sites in the city - including some that were hidden from the regular tourist stops. at the end of the day, we were returned to the home of our children, much richer and wiser in the ways and culture of the city."

I quickly dropped Andras an email with our hotel contact information and when we would be available and hoped for the best. Well, as it worked out...I did get the best....Andras! With our limited time Andras put together a driving tour around Budapest and got in more than we could have ever hoped for. I was traveling with someone who has difficulty walking and instinctively Andras arranged the tour to meet a limited walkers needs. We learned, we saw , we enjoyed! My only regret was that we missed having lunch at the home of Andras parents. We had already booked a tour through our cruise line, our mistake...we had already learned so much more from Andras...and we missed a great meal. Don't make the same mistake we did....do all of your Budapest tours with Andras. The price is reasonable, the service is outstanding and you get so much more for your time and money. Not only will you see and do things with Andras that you will never get from a tour bus, he also sees to your comfort and safety. A street vendor was being too pushy to buy their wares and Andras stepped right in and told them in a firm but polite manner to back away. The climbing on and off of a tour bus got old quickly, Andras with a private car and door to door service is the only way to go. In the end, we felt we had more of a feeling for Budapest than another 8 days filled with cruise line tours in 3 more countries. The difference was because of Andras. He really is the best."

            "review": "Our Best Day In Budapest!. My wife and I came to Budapest only for a short weekend to celebrate the new year. With limited time, we wanted a tour that would show us the sights (obviously!) but also give us the best impression of everyday life in Budapest. Andras provided all that and more. We booked two half day tours. Day one, we were taken to see the local sights and the \"hidden treasures\" of Budapest. This was all great. But day two was what really stuck with us. Andras met us early and took us to Szentendre, a beautiful artisan village on the Danube Bend. We visited a ceramic shop in the home of a local family. This was no ordinary tourist stop. The couple there were warm and inviting, and after a brief demonstration on the pottery wheel, they gave us an opportunity to try it for ourselves. It certainly wasn't as easy as it looked and I soon found myself making a mess of things! But after some more encouragement and patience on their part, we were each able to produce a somewhat acceptable ceramic dish. Great fun and some good laughs. After this we took a stroll through the village, with Andras giving us a brief history of the area and also stopping at the local Christmas food carts to explain the foods available and the traditions behind each. Interesting stuff.The highlight of our day (actually our trip) was stopping at the home of Andras' parents for a traditional Hungarian lunch. Again, this was no ordinary tourist stop. Andras' parents graciously invited us into their home (on New Year's Eve, no less) with a warm greeting to go along with a few glasses of palinka. Think of it as a Hungarian grappa....burns going down but warms you all over! After this, we settled in for our lunch. My wife and I loved the restaurants in Budapest, but this was BY FAR the best meal we had during our stay, made all the more pleasurable by the warmth and kindness of Andras and his parents. We were told that it is different each time, so the only thing you need to know is that it was all delicious!After lunch and a great dessert, we said goodbye to his parents, and Andras returned us to our hotel, where we promptly cancelled our NYE dinner reservation as there was little chance we could even think of eating for the rest of the day! Also, a half day tour turned out to be from around 9am until after 3pm, making this an excellent value as well. Most places, this would constitute a full day. Excellent, excellent experience, and not to be missed if you find yourself in Budapest.Andras, thank you for providing a truly memorable experience and give our warmest regards to your parents. \"Boldog uj evet!!!\""

He speaks english very well and was thorough and easy to understand. He covered a lot of ground with us during the course of the day. Our favorite moment being when he took us to his parents home for a home cooked hungarian lunch.his parents welcomed us with open arms and served us on of our favorite meals of the trip. his mother doted over us to make sure we ate enough. With a 20 & 22 year old sons who came with us she wanted to make sure they got 'enough'. :0) She is a fabulous cook and we had such a wonderful time.The afternoon was filled with a walking tour and we covered a lot of ground. I cannot think of a better way to get a 'feel' for the city than to hire a local guide. I highly suggest Andras."

Andras' friend provides the car and acts as driver. His enthusiasm for his car was evident and it is such a quirky car that it even attracted the attention of locals!After getting a bit orientated with the morning tour we then headed to Andras' parents for lunch. We were greeted so warmly and really treated as special guests. They are such a charming and delightful couple - it was an honour and a pleasure to visit their home. And then there was the food, wine and palinka! Andras' mother is a wonderful cook - we enjoyed lunch immensely. In the afternoon we did the city discovery tour which had us on and off public transport and in and out of local cafes and shops seeking help from locals with our 'tasks'. This was a great way to experience their friendliness and willingness to help the 'tourists'!In the evening Andras saw us onto an evening cruise along the Danube - so beautiful at night!The next day Andras took us to Szentendre where we met the loveliest couple who gave us the opportunity to try our hand on the pottery wheel. It was heaps of fun and afterwards we had a stroll through the gorgeous village. After this it was back to Andras' parents house for lunch again - an absolute highlight and it was with real fondness we said good-bye to them.Our last few hours with Andras were spent at a family run winery outside of Budapest. Our very engaging hostess explained about winemaking in Hungary and what they are working to achieve with their winemaking. We tasted a delicious selection of wines and had another beautiful meal here. Andras was a great guide. He was very knowledgable but delivered information about the history and life in Budapest in a relaxed and conversational way. It was really like touring around with a friend of a friend. He made life easy for us. He met us at our hotel each day. He was considerate and flexible about our itinerary. I think anyone who wants to experience more than just the main sights of Budapest and get a real feel for life in Budapest should organise a tour with My Personal Budapest."

The free walking trips are a great way to see the main tourist attractions of central Budapest but Andras provides a very economical way to see and experience life in Hungary away from the city centre. My wife and I are retired folk from Australia and we were on our first visit to Europe. We hired Andras for one and a half days and we had the most amazing time. On day one we drove to a small town outside of Budapest called Szentendre where we experienced a hands on pottery workshop before wandering around this pretty town renowned for its art and craft production. We then drove to his parents home for a wonderful traditional Hungarian lunch - his Mum and Dad were great company and the food was excellent. The day concluded with a visit to a winery where we were provided with a very informative tour of the property and feted with numerous wines to taste along with some sumptuous food. Day two was a half day walk around parts of Budapest to visit places that are not listed in the tour books or covered by the walking tours. We finished with lunch at a very traditional Hungarian cafe that most visitors would not find.Andras is a great guide and will formulate an itinerary to meet your wishes. He is extremely friendly, very knowledgeable and reliable. An absolute must if you want firsthand experience of Hungarian life."

His unique tours show you a beautiful glimpse of Hungary you would never see or know otherwise. Andr\u00e1s is highly qualified in his line of work- he took me and my boyfriend through Szentendre, the Danube bend, Visegr\u00e1d, Esztergom and even Slovakia. Each city had its own charm and had particular attractions to see. All the cities shared a picturesque setting, welcoming a more relaxing pace from the hustle and bustle of Budapest. La piece de resistance of the day was the wine tour in Etyek. We were taken to a private estate of a family run vineyard. The family was very welcoming and friendly. They explained everything from how they produced the wine, to shipping it out to restaurants- all while making sure our wine glasses were never empty. This particular vineyard had a Michelin star restaurant buying their wine, so you can imagine the high quality of wine. After a tour of the wine cellar we were brought up to the kitchen which was cozy and elegantly decorated with vintage Hungarian decor. Sitting by the fireplace with a glass of fine wine in hand, enjoying tasty salami's, cheeses and homemade bread was an experience which will forever stay in our memories. Thank you kindly to Andr\u00e1s for his carefully chosen tours of a hidden, understated Hungary."

            "review": "A memorable day in Budapest. I recently travelled to Budapest with a group of friends and family members and considered hiring a local private guide. After experiencing some difficulties finding a reliable guide, I found MyperonalBudapest and its guide, Andras, through Trip Advisor. My mission was to make an effort and organize this day in Budapest so that the group members would have fond memories for many years to come. I wanted to immerse in the Hungarian culture as much as possible in the time available. Following a number of emails we worked out an itinerary to suit everybody in our group. I requested Andras to take us through parts of Budapest by foot and/or public transportation to better interact with the locals. Andras embraced this idea and furthermore, he suggested that he combines it with a point-to-point drive in 4 Trabants in their original condition. Our morning started at 8:00. Andras, very punctual, meeting us at the hotel, and using the public transportation took us to the private studio of Mr. Adam Fellegi, a famous Hungarian pianist. I had previously requested Mr. Fellegi, via MyperonalBudapest, to take us through Franz Liszt\u2019s artistic life with relevant fragments of his creations from his early years through his mature period as a composer. Mr. Fellegi, who is a charming individual, surprised us with having an opera singer, Mr. Jekl Laszlo join us in his studio to further emphasize Liszt\u2019s contribution to opera. Toward the end of our engagement, Mr. Fellegi played at our request a number of pieces, including Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue, without any previous preparation. The experience we had was great, to listen to an internationally renowned pianist, in his own studio, playing anything we would ask. After the Liszt musical lesson we boarded an air conditioned van and were taken to a typical Hungarian home where we were served a traditional, Hungarian lunch. While in the van, we were given a brief Hungarian history starting from the original settlers in the Pannonia Valley all the way through the Austro-Hungarian Empire, communist era, and the latest political changes. The lunch was delicious, home made pastries, the traditional palinka, home made gulyas and local wine to match the food. The desert was a delicious cake and fresh fruits. One of our group members had her birthday on that day, and was pleasantly surprised by having been served a birthday cake along with the Happy Birthday sang in Hungarian.Following the lunch we returned to the city center and started our Trabant experience. For the following 3.5 hours, we were shown the highlights of Budapest: architectural marvels, cultural edifices, a beautiful caf\u00e9, and the way of life on a typical weekday in Budapest. The car is a hallmark of the communist era. I thought it was a great idea to go back in time and see the communist Budapest in a typical communist era means of transportation. The car drivers were all very friendly and knowledgeable of their cars. The experience turned out to be another highlight of the day.The Trabant journey ended at the Danube Palace Theatre where the young members of our group, engaged into a traditional folk dance class hosted by two professional dancers. It must have been one of the most enjoyable activities of the day, both for those directly involved in the dance class as well as those observing the dancers. After 1.5 hours of hopping, jumping, and beating boots, we attended a show performed by professional dancers; a live illustration of historical and modern times Hungarian folk dances, choreographed by the same couple that taught our younger members. At around 10:30 pm we finalized the day on a night cruise on the Danube with dinner.  Andras was a exceptional tour guide. He organized the various meetings with the people involved in the various activities, purchased our public transportation tickets, arranged for food, purchased the show tickets, the boat tickets, took care of ALL organizational details. There were no glitches; everything went smoothly. We did work out all the details prior to our meeting via emails. Andras definitely knows how to manage a day, and as such, all activities planned did happen. Overall we had a great day and really enjoyed our time in Budapest. Andras representing MyperonalBudapest was not only a great guide, but his knowledge and organization skills truly made the difference. I, and everyone in the group, highly recommend him."

Encouraged by a great experience in Sarajevo and Belgrade with an outstanding guide Zlatan Ilic http://alturl.com/ce4yi we decided a personal guide was a must if we were to see anything of the Hungarian capital. When we first made contact with Andras we listed our 'must sees' as well a run down on what we both like to do when we visit a new city. He promptly came back to us with a tailor-made itinerary, this started with a decidedly-different city tour with us being whisked off through the narrow lanes of Budapest in a communist-era Trabant. With his colleague Balazs at the wheel we spluttered back and forth across the river Danube stopping at one breathtaking sight after another. Three hours later Andras drove us to his parent's house in the suburbs where we enjoyed a delicious, traditional Hungarian lunch prepared by his mother. Mrs Novak, now a successful businesswoman, gave us a first-hand account of her country's transition from Communist rule. Chatting to her gave us an insight not normally enjoyed by tourists. Part of Andras's 'unique selling point' is that his tours are a little 'quirkier' than the others. That afternoon proved the point: we could barely take in all he showed us. Starting with an Art Nouveau cafe and museum we moved on to the city's Jewish Quarter (great for photography) stopping to enjoy the traditional Flodni cake at Rachel's Bakery. The next stop gave us a chance to catch our breath in the famous Ruin Pub, now a standard bearer for underground culture. As he walked us back through Budapest's 8th district to our hotel we were struck by his stockpile of anecdotes as every building, monument and business seemed to inspire yet another one. A truly remarkable day! We would recommend Andras to any traveller who wants to experience Budapest!Robert Mullan Liz Russell www.robertmullan.com"

I am so thankful that we signed up for this tour. With the small group we were able to see so many different areas and we learned things at each spot that we would not have on a larger tour. Andras was a fantastic guide and he explained aspects of Budapest's history that show the knowledge and love he has for the city. I really enjoyed hearing about the history of the city and the devastation but also the perseverance of Budapest. I also never realized how affected the Jewish community in Budapest was hit during the persecution and was moved by the synagogue area. I also thoroughly enjoyed the winery. It was so beautiful to be able to see the crowded city and then in a short drive to also see the countryside that was just incredibly beautiful. My favorite part of this tour though was getting to spend time with local people from the Trabant drivers, to lunch with Andras's mom, to the owner of the vineyard. We had a very short time in Budapest but I left feeling like we had a very complete trip and I learned a lot about the city and had too much fun doing it!"

We started off with a city tour in a Trabant....be aware that the car is REALLY small, but it was a lot of fun! Afterwards we went to a winery outside of the city and had a personal wine tasting with the winemaker. We even got to taste some wine right out of the barrel. Excellent wine and a really neat experience. Budapest is a beautiful city and this was an excellent way to take in all of the city sights and also do something more personal."

My friends and I were looking to book a trip in Europe for the weekend and my father recommended that we visit Budapest. We booked a tour with Andras and it was all that we could've asked for and more. Andras really made and effort to get to know us and tailor the tour to our personalities. We saw the \"must see\" sights in the morning and went to the hidden gems in the afternoon. He took us to the law school as he knew we were law students. After a whole day, he got to know our personalities and showed us a pub that he knew we would like that was also a pub unique to Budapest. The most outstanding part of the tour was the personal connections we made. The homemade Hungarian lunch was delicious and the hospitality was even better. Seeing the architecture and historical sights of Budapest was wonderful, but being immersed into Hungarian culture is what made Andras's tour truly unique. Initially, we were supposed to do a wine tasting but the wine makers had to cancel. Andras knew how much we were looking forward to it, so he arranged with the wine makers to do a tasting before our flight. It was not the most convenient time for Andras but he made arrangements to make sure we were able to make our flight on time. It was a great way to end our trip (again, superb hospitality) and we were so grateful to have such a great tour guide. I had no idea what to expect from Budapest, but it totally exceeded my expectations- in large part because of Andras. He made our holiday an absolutely outstanding one."

Lunch at Mom and Pop's house was the highlight. AMAZING! They were so nice too.. we wanted them to adopt us. They really made us feel at home. I feel lucky to have had such a unique experience.

My husband, daughter and I have just come back from an amazing trip to Austria, Slovakia and Hungary and I have to say, our day with Andras was one of the highlights. We are very interested in history and in seeing things from a local perspective and Andras more than fulfilled our expectations which were high based on the feedback given here by others. The Trabant tour was very fun, and as others have expressed, we felt like we were the tourist attractin at times! Lunch with Andras' parents is a must do. We were taken into their home as guests and felt like we had made new friends. Hopefully they will contact us if they ever make it to Norway :) The tour to Szentendre was very nice and Andras never made us feel stressed although we aren't the quickest of tourists...taking about 500 pictures! I highly recommend this trip...you will never forget it!"

This was our second visit to Budapest, so we opted for \"10 hidden treasures - things not found in guide books\" which were varied and fun, particularly with Andras to chat with on the way. The Art Nouveau cafe was interesting, the Central Europesn Jewish cake was good, the fountains were fun, the pub in a ruined building was zany and the remnants of the ghetto wall very moving. Andras parents were great hosts for lunch, and it is always good to get out of a city centre and see what it is really like yo live there. With the help of the Hungarian / English and English / Hungarian parts of the dictionary, we all found we could talk about anything, and felt like we had made new friends. Perhaps when you visit, Andras's mother will be trying out the Scottish gingerbread recipe we have since sent her. The next morning we had the pleasure of visiting Mr Fellegi for a concert of Liszt, Bartok, Chopin and Bach all played with not only skill but Hungarian fervour. My daughter is a pianist and post-graduate music student, so we had arranged this as a treat for her, but all three of us enjoyed it very much. It was actually rather sad parting with Andras. like others, we felt we had made a new friend. The cost of the tour was not unreasonable for what was provided. Andras is knowledgable, well organised, flexible and very good company. his tours are well worth a go."

            "review": "most satisfying day with Andras. I travel a lot, and when I get time from work to explore a place that I have never been, I want someone local to show me around. This experience did not disappoint. Andras Novak is an enterprising entrepreneur with a personal touch, and he has named his business well. After customizing my tour via his website, he contacted me to make certain that my selections were going to meet my needs. We modified my first selection, and as a result, the second half of my day was spent at a beautiful family run vineyard about 45 minutes out of Budapest. My work colleague and I did his \"best of\" tour, and it was perfectly fine for an overview of the city. We saw all the top sites, and it gave us enough to know which places to visit on our own. Budapest is spread out, and it would be difficult to walk all the sites, so Andras's driving us around was the way to go. We were treated to lunch my his most delightful parents, and with an excellent menu, the conversation was very pleasing. His mother is a wonderful cook, and we teased her that she is becoming world famous on TripAdvisor! His father was a gracious host, and the warmth of their home made our visit unique. I have never been invited into someone's home as part of the tour, and I certainly enjoyed. After a leisurely and delicious lunch, we headed to the country for a great wine tasting. Glasses were filled with Sauvignon Blanc, Cuvee, and Pinot Noir, and we got some great lessons on the local varietals. I came home with two bottles, too! All in all, I recommend MY PERSONAL BUDAPEST for the traveler who wants to learn enough of the city without doing the standard tour guide stuff, and for someone who wants a personal, local connection. I was glad I stayed the extra day before returning home to the US after by business meeting."

I explained that we had children and their ages, 6 and 11. I explained what I was looking for in a tour. He was very fast at returning my email and had sent some ideas for me to look over. After review, I sent my choices to him. Everything was scheduled and a price was agreed.The day of the tour he met us at our hotel on time and was very excited to meet us and show us his country. We started out on the Trabant tour. The lttle cars were so cute. My children just loved them. The tour took us all over from the Gellert Hill, Castle District, Around Parliament and Central Pest. There were many stops for sight seeing and photos. When we would stop and get out of the Trabant cars everyone would be looking, because the cars are so neat. My husband said, he felt like he was part of a tour. It was really cool.After the Trabant tour we headed for Andras home for lunch. We were greeted by his parents upon arrival. They were so kind and made all of us feel welcome. The luch was wounderful. We had chicken soup, Hungarian chicken paprikas, home made noodles and Hungarian cake. Everyone one had seconds it was so good. After coffee on the patio we departed to our next adventure.We were on our way to a ceramic workshop near Szentendre. Laszlo and Gabriella the owner of the shop showed us around and then the kids got involved in making bowls. They both did such a great job. A thank you to them for the gift that they share. We then drove to the little town of Szentendre. After arriving and walking around we purchased our memories and headed back to Budapest after walking along the Danube. Such beauty in this part of the world.We had a little time available before our river boat tour. My family and Andras found a nice spot near the dock to sit and rest. Andras helped my husband chose a nice glass of red wine for him and a white for me. We talked about everything we had just experienced and thanked him for showing us Budapest. We will be returning in the fall and doing the wine tour without the kids. :} Thank you, see you soon Andras!!!"

Although he talked English because of some other British clients we could ask questions in German. His knowledge of both languages is marvellous (much better than my English). We learnt a lot about Hungarian history and he showed us the most beautiful and interesting buildings and explained the different architectural styles. We also had a look at some romantic places. After this tour next day there was time to visit our favorite places again and spend some more time in locations of our special interest.We (4 Germans) booked an excursion to the \u201eDanube Knee\u201c. Andr\u00e1s showed us the small artisan town Szentendre and the biggest cathedral of Hungary in Esztergom, where the first king of Hungary was crowned. We could feel that Andr\u00e1s is proud of his country and he loves it with all its changeful history. One high-light was a wine tasting in a small vineyard in Etyek. Our host showed us their cellar and explained a lot of wine-making. They offered a little delicious snack and of course several different wines. The taste was great. We enjoyed the day with a really good and engaged guide Andr\u00e1s. Thank you for a beautiful trip in your home country.Claudia and J\u00fcrgen"

We then traveled to make a piece of pottery. We weren't really very good at it but we had lots of laughs and memories to take home. Andras was very knowledgable and passionate about his home of Budapest and it surely made us fall in love with the city. I can say that Andras made our time in Budapest very enjoyable.

            "review": "Fantastic experience!. Words can not begin to describe our feelings after such two great days spent visiting and experimenting Budapest and the Hungarian country side, in such a friendly way. Let us try to describe our 2 days tour:\u2028\u2028We (my husband and I) started the first day visit with a Trabant tour. Andras was waiting for us in our hotel, and our first impression was that he is very reliable, professional and well educated tourist guide. The young gentlemen who was providing the Trabant was very enthusiastic about his car, and we could see that he was taking much care and pride in maintaining the antique in good shape. We went to the castle and Andras explained us lots of interesting facts about the Hungarian history. After they took us to a tour around the city, and a stop in a very nice caf\u00e9 which is an Art nouveau furniture museum at the same time. As an industrial designer, I found this visit quite interesting, to see all these different kinds of rare furniture.\u2028\u2028Then, Andras took us to his parent\u2019s home, which was a lovely home located in a residential neighborhood. I found it nice to see how it looks like outside the city center. Andras\u2019s parents made everything to make us feel like at home, and let me tell you how much we have eaten as if we were kings! I wish I could have seen Andras\u2019s Mom cooking, so that to learn some of her secrets!\u2028\u2028After, Andras and his father brought us to Szentendre, where we visited the lovely village. Afterwards began some moments that I will never be able to forget! We went to a ceramic workshop in Szentendre and met with some very friendly people (Gabriella and Laszlo), who were patient enough to teach us the basics of pottery making; my husband and I both had the opportunity to try a ceramic piece of art each. It was such a sensual and technical experience! We had so much fun trying to do our ceramic piece! It is a pitty that we live so far away from Hungary as we both felt that we could become good friends with them!\u2028\u2028We ended our day with a private piano concert, in a famous pianist\u2019s appartment, Mr. Fellegi. This was, in my opinion, a MAGIC moment, something I will still remember when I will be an old lady (!) It is hard to explain the feeling of being \u00abinside\u00bb the music and not only listening to the classical music on a CD or the radio. Mr. Fellegi really made us feel comfortable and we were in the right atmosphere to enjoy the piano concert.\u2028\u2028The second day was even more unforgettable: Andras and his father took us to the city of Eztergom, we had the opportunity to cross the Danube to see Slovakia, and we also visit Hungary\u2019s largest church, which is on top of a hill with a beautiful view on the Danube and Slovakia. We also had lunch in a great restaurant (here my husband will recommend the Transylvania soup that is incredibly tasteful and delicious!)\u2028\u2028We visited the country side and we ended our day in a vineyard. I believe this was my husband\u2019s favorite part! The lady, Vali Herny\u00e1k took the time to explain us about her familly\u2019s winery business and made us taste many different wines (all very - very nice!) We could see how much love she puts in her art and we very much appreciated the time she spent with us. We also had a plate of local home-made cold cuts and cheese (again, incredibly delicious with the last wine we have tasted). Again, and sorry for repeating myself! we felt that we could have become good friends with this lovely lady and husband as we share the same vision of work and life.\u2028\u2028Everyone we have met with Andras were friendly and warm in a genuine way. We feel that we have some friends now in Hungary and almost a familly there!\u2028\u2028Not only that, but we were never rushed through the events and location, giving ample time to enjoy the activities in a tailored fashion. Also Andras was very organised and everything run smoothly during the 2 days.\u2028\u2028Needless to say at this point that we highly recommand the personnal tour provided by Andras and let us tell you that it is worth every penny invested.\u2028\u2028Regards from Canada,\u2028\u2028Caroline and Fran\u00e7oys\u2028\u2028P.S. We read an other comment on this site that we can barely understand! The car that was supplied to do the tour was a Corolla in very good condition, and pretty recent. Why would some members of TripAdvisor use this site to put down in an exagerated way some facts? Opinions are opinions but facts should be based on reality, so that Trip Advisor can continue to be a reliable tool."

            "review": "This is a tour well above and beyond expectations!. As a frequent solo traveler, I have often found standard group tours to be impersonal and uniform. Admittedly, I am a tour guide and that sometimes makes it hard to concentrate on the tour & not the tour guide\u2019s technique. After reading previous reviews, MyPersonalBudapest seemed to exactly fit my needs and wants. I contacted Andras and arranged for a personal two-day tour, including airport transfers.My two day tour went by quickly... almost too quickly. Looking back, I realize that I never felt that I was on an actual tour. It was, as if, a trusted friend had invited me to visit Budapest, then proceeded to show off its greatest attributes. Andras provides a warm and gracious welcome to Budapest\u2019s best charms... the food, history, architecture and most importantly the local hospitality. On the first tour day, I was greeted by Balazs, a Trabant owner/driver. The driving tour was wonderful with Andras giving details on what we saw, explaining the history of where we were, plus we stopped several times for better views and history focus. Balazs is a very sweet, friendly man who kindly (and humbly) answered all my Trabant questions, allowing me to check out the engine, and even told me about his weekend stunt driving activities. Yes, I am somewhat fascinated by older cars.Afterwards, Andras & I visited Szentendre where local ceramic artists introduced me to molding clay into functional art. I never imagined that I would actually touch the clay, not to mention make something! It was hard work, but a really fulfilling experience. I may have to sign up for classes in the future. The first day ended with the local pub night, which was a lot of fun. We were joined by a few of Andras\u2019 friends, which only made the experience more authentic. What\u2019s drinking at the pub without a few friends? We visited three distinctly different (non-touristy) pubs & I never felt out of place or even noticed... excellent. The second day began walking around the city, as Andras pointed out hidden treasures not mentioned in guide books. I particularly liked this part of the tour; because I\u2019m pretty sure I would not have found these places. After lunch we visited Etyek, spending time at a family run winery. Instead of listening to a lecture or presentation, there was a conversation explaining what they do and what they hope to do. I was introduced to how the family produces their wine, the different ages of their vines, the makeup of the region\u2019s soil & their future foray into brandy making. I left Etyek much more knowledgeable about the Hungarian wine making process, with a great bottle of wine and a full stomach. On both days, lunch was a meal brilliantly cooked by Andras\u2019 mother. Andras\u2019 parents are a welcoming, funny and engaging couple. Upon entering the house, I was greeted with hugs & plum palinka (yum). The excellent food was served at the family dining table surrounded by family photos and books. Afterwards, coffee was enjoyed out on the terrace while soaking up the sun\u2019s rays. On the second day, Andras\u2019 mother could not be there, but she thoughtfully prepared the meal before leaving for the day. Andras\u2019 father was wonderful as he presented & served his wife\u2019s efforts. Just imagine visiting an aunt & uncle that you haven\u2019t seen in a long time, and being welcomed with home cooking and good conversation.Because I opted for a personal tour, Andras offered to include or substitute places/activities, depending on my preference. I declined as I was perfectly happy with the agreed upon tour. I would not have changed a detail of this unique Budapest tour, except maybe to add another day. MyPersonalBudapest provided me with fabulous memories, well above and beyond my expectations. I can easily recommend taking this tour & I whole-heartedly encourage other Budapest visitors to sign up for this one-of-a-kind experience. Andras is the perfect host to introduce the wonders of Budapest."

Budapest has been on my 'travel wish list' for years, and for this reason, I wanted this trip to be perfect ... and it was! A couple of weeks before our arrival, I had a long E-Mail exchange with Andr\u00e1s regarding the preparation of the trip - we finally choose a quite rich program : Day 1: We started with a city tour was very interesting and gave us a first overview of Budapest and the places to see. The 'Hungarian' lunch was delicious and it was very interesting to visit a genuine Hungarian home (OK, the trip was a bit long, but finally worth it). Finally, a treasure hunt made us raise our heads and notice funny details we would never have discovered alone \u2026Day 2We started at 9 with an Art-D\u00e9co tour in two vintage cars (a Citro\u00ebn Traction from 1954 as well as a Rolls Royce Silver Spur) - this was just gorgeous, and we discovered numerous partly incredible treasures - with very competent guides (we had almost a ratio of 1:1 between guides and tourists ;-). We then had lunch in what Andr\u00e1s called the \"best pancake bar in town\" - this was not extraordinary, but correct. In the afternoon, we enjoyed a relaxing tour on the Danube and then headed to the climax of the stay: a private concert given by a famous Hungarian pianist at his home. This was gorgeous, especially for me as an amateur pianist - and we were so pleased that we invited the pianist to play for our friends when he will next come to Switzerland - which will be in two months. If you are looking for a way to \"deep dive\" into the Hungarian Culture and the architectural, cultural and social heritage of Budapest, then I can recommend Andr\u00e1s without any reserve. Although some of the reviewers find that the trip is expensive, I do not share this position - we came back with tons of beautiful images and interesting information - and this is something money finally can't buy! Thanks Andr\u00e1s, we really enjoyed our discovery of Budapest!"

You start off with a great view of the city, get to see all the famous historical sites, and learn a ton of information from a native Budapester. The best part is.. for lunch you actually go to his parents house and get a home cooked meal! That alone makes it worth it, you can't get something unique like this unless you have family there or know someone. In the afternoon, you play an Amazing Race style game where you run around Budapest gathering information about different landmarks and hopping on busses and metros in the process. It forces you to interact with the locals while learning cool stuff, and the competition is also a lot of fun. Nothing like seeing your friends running in the distance towards the bus you caught in the nick of time. The day ends with a night cruise, which gives a whole different perspective on the city. I wish they would do this kind of thing in more cities.."

Having never visited Budapest, or Hungary for that matter, my partner and I knew little of it apart from what we had read but many websites focussed on the city's obvious USP's (unique selling points) like the cave system and the spas and less so on the wonderful hospitality and the sights and sounds of the contrasting areas of Buda and Pest. Many websites also concentrated on restaurant reviews, however we found a gem that most people never know about, unless they had contacted you. Our second stop on our tour, if you recall, after visiting the beautiful riverside town of Szentendre was for a genuine home cooked family meal. At that point I knew we'd booked something truly special that a large tour operator could only wish to replicate, and fail. Not only was the food delicious but the hospitality was amazing and we left feeling very full!All of the travel was taken care of which was fantastic and we were given plenty of opportunities to explore the town for ourselves. you found the right balance between being a tour guide and letting ourselves wander. You also organised our cruise of the Danube and took us to a fun ceramic making session where Alexandra and I still argue about who made the best plate. For the record, it was me! If that wasn't enough we also had time to squeeze in a visit to a family vineyard where after sampling lots of wine we were able to sit, eat and reflect on a great four days in your country.So, to us, the people are what made Budapest the great holiday it was and we would like to thank you Andras. Best wishes to your family also. I thoroughly recommend you and mypersonalbudapest to anyone who's looking to do something different on their vacation and have completely unique stories to tell when you come home.

Andras is a very patient and dedicated tour guide who had time for everyone in the group and who made sure that everyone was comfortable and enjoying their trip. I have requested a specially tailored itinerary to our needs and wishes months before our trip and Andras was the only local guide that rendered very detailed advises and assistance in all ways to make sure that our trip is an enjoyable one not restricted only in budapest but other leg of our europe trip as well. And everyone enjoyed the programme to the fullest--kids and adults alike! He made sure we got to see, taste, smell and feel the best of Budapest in just 4 days. Andras was also very knowledgeable and passionate about spreading the Hungarian culture, history and way of life, and it was extremely enriching and truly eye-opening as we learnt about Budapest and Hungary from him. It was really an unforgetable experience to have lunch at his house, where we had the rare chance to taste true Hungarian cuisine and to interact with his parents to get to know the true Hungarian way of life! Not forgetting his mother, a true warrior, during the snow war with all the kids. They really enjoyed it! All in all, it was a most memorable and enjoyable time in Budapest with Andras, and definitely a very unforgettable stay that captured the essence of Budapest!"

The Trebanta cars that use were a fun way to get around the city. A half day is plenty to see all the sites. Lunch was excellent at our host\u2019s home \u2013 real nice lad named Marta - and it was cool to see how real residents of the city live. And we enjoyed the thermal baths as well, which was the last top. All in all, a superb way to see Budapest, despite the cold weather. Excellent service!"

Reliable, helpful and very implicated we had been taken in charge after he perfectly understood our expectations. I am not complicated and so looking only after pure and authentic local ambience at reasonable but affordable price that can save us time and disillusions. Andras managed on a 2 day notice to understand how different my expectations are. We asked for more city aspects than only the main general attractions and to have a tour in a way we can get the flavour of the past years including underground, gastronomy, ethnical, cultural and night life. Andras managed in 24 hours with 2 Trabants and a magnificent timing to bring us in places you can not even imagine. And the most appreciable was the lunch that his mother prepared in their house. Thank you to all his family and friends that supports him to organise the poetic way of looking at Budapest. We recommend to everybody interested to see through Hungarian eyes this third capital on the Danube.Maryse and GeorgeBelgium"

We were looking for a tour to familiarize ourselves with Budapest and its sites but wanted to feel we were visiting family who was showing us around. Andras delivered just that. We contact him prior to arrival to arrange the Trabant sightseeing tour with the lunch at a Hungarian Home. The Trabants are very unique. People could not help look at us in these little weightless cars. They drove through very narrow streets even backroads we are sure the tour buses can't. The drivers who own the Trabants actually collect them and race them on 2 wheels! Amazing. The tour was at a great pace and reduced quite a bit of the walking which waas great for us. My friend Marta had just broken her foot and removed the cast right before the trip so she was concerned she would not be able to see everything or keep up walking but Andras kept the pace and the cars really made it all work. Make sure to share with Andras as much as possible about your interests so he can make additional suggestions for a truly unique experience. The Lunch was amazing and felt like we were part of the family. We kept comparing the Bean Goulash Soup we had at the home but none was better! As we toured with Andras, we shared about our love for wine and our interest to visit a local winery. He was so good to immediately check into it and he made arrangements with Hernyak Winery. I was left speechless once we arrived and tasted the wines. They are all handmade and the winemakers are so personable and friendly. We ate in the vineyard and remember the sun going down and the dining table getting dark just lit by the light of the fireplace... we could have been there exchanging stories for hours! Simply priceless folks."

However, Andras crafted a full day. 3-hour Trabant tour of the city, a marvelous meal at his parents' home and an amazing private concert of Hungarian composers by a concert artist in the pianist's own home. The music was the perfect end to a delightful day, and the meal and the music certainly put us in touch with a more personal view of Hungary and Budapest. The Trabant ride was spectacular (and tight!) for those with an interest in historic cars...driven by true Trabant lovers and collectors. The day was indeed expensive, but the personal nature of the tour AND the private concert made it worth every penny."

We contacted Andras after arriving in Budapest and he very willingly arranged, on very short notice, a personal tour of the highlights of this wonderful city. He went out of his way to show us things of interest that we would have found difficult to visit ourselves without a car. He has a very obvious passion for his work and for the city and country within which he lives. Our visit to the beautiful artists' village of Szentendre was wonderful, but my personal favorite was having fish, chips and local beer at an outdoor restaurant sitting right next to the Danube. This was obviously the real Budapest, and not a place that tourists would ever know to visit."

The history is a given in broad strokes, but the details that matter to me are in the interchange of questions about culture, people, and issues of today. Facts cannot be easily forgotten, but to me the most memorable and endearing way to know Hungary is to take a trip with Andrej. Lunch with his parents is a true highlight. They too are warm, sincere, and genuine. The food is homely. It is a personal and unique experience. The 'treasure hunt' of the second half of the tour is an independent interactive questionaire. The 'treasure' is in walking a city, learning the facts, and meeting the people. Great idea. This the reward of an experience that will leave an unforgettable memory in our hearts and mind."

In addition, he wanted us to really get to the know situation in Budapest presently and he talked a good deal about the current state of politics and economics there. On the lighter side, Zoltan took our group to a ruin bar and some of us sampled the traditional Palinka drink. After that half day tour, Zoltan took us to a local restaurant for dinner where we experienced great traditional Hungarian food! The next day we spent a full day with Zoltan, seeing many of the great sights/views on the Buda and Pest sides of the city. We also sampled many forms of transportation including the tram, subway, & bus. Zoltan had stories about every subject and once again we enjoyed a very good local lunch with him. At the end of our tours with Zoltan, we all felt we had a good grasp of Hungarian culture and we were appreciative of Zoltan's breath of knowledge about all things Hungarian. Thank you Zoltan!"

Enter Kalliope! (sp?) and the \"Classic Tour.\" She told us about the history of what we were seeing, interspersed with antidotes from the past and from her personal experiences. As others have commented, this wasn't a tour with a prepared script or strictly prepared route. She arranged our route according to our wishes and abilities (one of my friends was recovering from foot surgery, not able to walk a lot on the cobblestone streets of old Budapest) so we walked through the castle district, the Citadella and Hero's Square at a leisurely pace.

My husband and I were ending a Danube River cruise and extended our stay in Budapest so I could try to visit the villages where my grandparents were born.Our neighbor recommended Rockhoppers after using them as a private guide for 3 days in Budapest last year.Well, about a month before we left the States,I got in touch we Zoltan and we set up the date. It turned out that the little jaunt I expected would actually be a 3 hour car ride out to the western part of Hungary, and back. But, he was game for it, and so was I.Zoltan is a former university professor, so his knowledge of all things, and all things about Hungary in particular, is extensive. We had a lively discussion about politics, culture, travel, and folks in general on the way out to my ancestor's villages. I was a bit apprehensive about spending that much time in a car, but he made the time fly.He is truly an excellent guide. As well as a great person.The best part of the day was that I met a woman to whom I'm related! We were checking out the cemeteries in the villages, hoping to find my great-grandparents' graves ( over 100 years old\u2026it was a long shot). This lady visiting graves at one of the cemeteries heard me tell my husband that I found a family name. She came running over to me, chattering in Hungarian ( i know 4 words). Zoltan stepped in and started to translate. Turns out, her great-grandmother and mine were sisters. We spent several hours with her as she took us around to visit the family homes. She told me a little about our connections, and Zoltan was there to sort things out and interpret for us.Wonderful day. We spent a total of 9+ hours with him. He was as charming at the end of the day, as he was at the beginning. ANd after 6+ house of driving for him. A total treat to tour with. Bonus:After arriving home, I received a phone call and email from my cousin and her daughter ( who spoke a very little English). I contacted Zoltan and he graciously offered to call her back and make sure she knew I wanted to keep in touch. He also offered to translate emails for me. Great guy. But he's Hungarian, so what would you expect?Dont hesitate to book him or any one else at this site.PS -ask him about Absurdistan\u2026."

Zoltan is there to show you around."

We had already done a bus tour on our river cruise and wanted to gain some insight, one on one, with a local. Zoltan is interesting, knowledgable, entertaining and irreverent, which is just our style. From the statue of Ronald Reagan to schnapps at a local bar, we came away from this tour feeling that we had caught a glimpse of the real Budapest."

I didn't know much about the city, and felt the best way to learn would be get a private tour from an experienced local. Zoltan was just that. I got a little lost trying to find him in the beginning of the trip (long story haha) but our time together was great. I learned so much about the history and culture and he pointed out things I would have never noticed. I didn't feel like one of the tourists in the huge crowds. It was very personal and Zoltan is very easy to communicate with. All in all, it was a great experience and I highly recommend this tour."

Zoltan picked us up in our hotel lobby, and we chatted for 20 mins so he could get a feel for what we wanted to see, which was non-touristy, historical sites of the city. Like other reviewers said, he started off with a stop at a bar for brandy shots, which was great because it was cold and raining. Now warm and tingly, we set off to get the backstory of the various sites in the city, on both sides of the Danube. He helped us navigate the train and bus systems and he gave us a personal account of the different tensions tearing at this city in the last several decades. He also shared some colorful commentary of medieval Hungarian folklore to give a sense of how the city came to be. We loved our tour with him and it felt like hanging out with an old friend showing us his city. Highly recommended."

This review should have been written eight months ago, with the delay largely a result of my repeated attempts to capture in words the impact of Zoltan and Calliope on nine 10th and 11th grade students and their adult sponsors in November, 2015. When one student responded to a question about the high point of the trip, his one-word answer said it all: \u201cZoltan.\u201d As students reviewed for this spring\u2019s AP European exam, they acted out Kalliop\u00e9\u2019s kinesthetic descriptions of art styles we encountered during our introductory Budapest tour; this memory of what we heard, saw, and learned is extraordinary. Zoltan and Kalliop\u00e9 made history come alive as they shared their experiences and responses. Zoltan\u2019s personal stories of life during the last decades of Hungary\u2019s 20th century history and the rapid changes and challenges of the 21st century captured our minds and imaginations, allowing us to go beyond surface explanations, see connections between the past and the present, and look at the individual and human side of this wonderful city.  After six visits to Budapest and loving the special people and places to which I return, my trips will not be the same in the future if we do not include Zoltan and Kalliop\u00e9. For all the reasons mentioned in other reviews, I recommend Rockhoppers very highly. Zoltan\u2019s prompt communication, his understanding of the personality of people and groups, his flexibility and responses to our schedule, his personal interactions with group members\u2014all combined to make this an experience that I hope to repeat for years."

He also helped us to navigate the transit system - which went quite smoothly! He provided a balanced approach of historical perspective, along with the current issues of this historic city. The pace of the waking tour was perfect, and he was careful to gauge his audience. He incorporated some stops along the way - for example, we visited a market (one of the smaller ones) and enjoyed a snack to re-energize the my always-hungry teens (and maybe us adults, too!). He also helped us locate a delicious lunch location to end the informative tour. We so appreciated the personalized tour provided by Zoltan, along with his dry sense of humor and his insight into his beautiful city!! We highly recommend Zoltan and Rockhoppers Private Tours!"

We drove to Aquincum where Zoltan gave us an indepth history/walking tour of the old Roman ruins under the motorway. (Most people do not know that the ruins are there!). We drove to the Aquincum Museum which is very impressive. Outside we walked around the extensive ruins which cover a huge area which is only partly excavated. Among the ruins there are so many Roman baths which were excavated in order to show how they were constructed. Also there are a number of Roman sarcophagus on the site. Aquincum is 2000 years old and built by the Roman occupying forces. We highly recommend this tour with Zoltan giving an insight into the Roman occupation of this region."

Our tour with Kalliope was just amazing. She is such a friendly, exuberant and knowledgeable guide - she knew so much about not only the history and culture of the city, but also put together a marvelous sampling of traditional foods, wines, and liquors of Budapest. We had a delightful time wandering through the streets of the city and sampling the cuisine - a wonderful way to get to know any city! It was clear Kalliope had spent time putting together our itinerary and setting up the wine tastings and the fare at a local restaurant. It was fun just getting to know such a sparkling personality. The next day, Zoltan was unable to meet with us due to his car breaking down. He arranged for his colleague, Eva. Eva was really good, taking us all around the area, using public transportation, explaining more of the city's history and culture. We learned a lot and appreciated her kindly jumping in to take us around at our own pace, answering so many questions. Rockhopper is recommended - they seem to have an endless amount of knowledge on all topics, and were very flexible in helping us with negotiating in the marketplace, finding our way around, and generally helping us get the most out of our limited time in Budapest."

We booked 2 tours with Zoltan:1- Walking tour of Budapest (half day)2- Danube Bend (full day)As the tradition goes, the walking tour started with a shot of Palinka. Zoltan covered the historical highlights of Hungary and also covered some hidden details along the way, and discussed the political situation. We really appreciated hearing someone local talking about the communist era, and the political development of the last 25 years. Having read the TripAdvisor reviews, we knew what to expect (not quite a traditional aseptic talking tour, but rather a colorful depiction of things). We did see most of the Pest sides highlights during the walking tour. The tour ended at one of his favorite restaurant on the Buda side (for fish soup).The Danube Bend full day tour was quite different, driving in his old authentic LandRover. The day was quite relaxing and full. We stopped at Szentendre, Visigrad and Esztergom. The tour was well paced and relaxing, and were given some moment alone to stroll in some places.Thank you Zoltan !"

We were exposed to truths about the past & present which left us emotionally charged and with such great insight into this side of the world which is so different to that we call home. We hardly ventured far from our accommodation in the inner city but the conversation that continued as we strolled the streets, saw some of the sights, learnt the public transport system and enjoyed some local Hungarian delights at the market, cafe and restaurant was priceless and not something you could gain from any research done on the internet nor through your typical tour guide. We walked, chatted, laughed, ate, drank and listened so intently as everything was so interesting, not only that but Zoltan was very generous in providing further information about other activities to do whilst in Budapest and also offered further information/readings for the topics we discussed.

He will gladly share with you anything he knows about....especially his love for good palinkas! We mostly walked through town and crossed to Buda for the remainder of the tour. There we hung out at a local favorite bar (Palinkas) and ate at another local favorite eatery of his which was of course delicious.

Our initial contact was through email and told her what our interests were, about ourselves and level of physical abilities and set up the date and time to meet in Budapest. She met us at our hotel and briefly we met and charted our course based on our interests and her suggestions for the next 5 hours. She was a wealth of knowledge, extremely enthusiastic, very passionate about her beloved city Budapest, where she was born and raised and not to mention spoke fluent English. We did our sightseeing with her on foot or public transport. By the end of 5 hours with her we had seen so much of the city, learned a great deal about its history, people, culture and became so well versed with public transportation that the following days on our own we were able to find places on our own without wasting too much time figuring out routes to get there.I would strongly recommend engaging services of a personal tour guide for anyone going to Budapest as a tourist.

He would point out details all around us that we surely would have missed on our own. He was never short of a good anecdote and his conversation was easy and relaxed; always talking to us, never at us. Again, it was like walking with a friend.A short visit to a \"ruin bar\" proved to be a fun intermission and resulted in leaving on shaky legs from a healthy sampling of delicious Palinka, Our tour ended in a well chosen local and casual restaurant where I ate what was my best meal in Budapest.Zoltan clearly loves his country but he's also not shy about providing his opinion on the good, bad and ugly of Budapest and Hungary. I found this to be the most refreshing part of the tour as I prefer to hear a realistic perspective rather than a sugar-coated tourist spiel. I can't say enough good things about Zoltan and highly recommend booking a portion of your vacation in Budapest with him."

He is extremely knowledgable and just super fun to hang around with. Not only do you see the typical spots but you also discover the less known places away from tourist tracks, learn a lot about the history and have wonderful drinks along the way. Highly recommendable, super entertaining. Could not have been a better day!"

I really appreciated that he took the time to learn a little about us when we booked the tour. When he met us in the hotel he spent some time telling us about himself and Hungary's history. We walked all over the city and really got a view of sites as well as the progress Hungary has made since the end of World War 2 and the fall of Communism. It was interesting hearing Zoltan's opinions, coming from someone who loves his country, but is also an intellectual and a realist. In addition to all the places we went, we had lunch together and tasted Palinka. This tour was a great way to see the city and understand its history."

            "review": "The Most Interesting Man in the World: Hungarian Edition!. It struck me halfway through our tour who Zoltan reminded me of: the character from the widely popular Dos Equis advertising campaign. Not only in appearance, but also in charm and attitude! I'm not sure Zoltan knew what I was talking about when I mentioned it, but I hope he took it as the compliment it was intended to be. Zoltan escorted my husband and I around Budapest for a half-day tour (lasting about 6 hours) and opened our eyes to the beauty and tragedy of this former(?) Communist city. From the landscape (hilly Buda versus flat Pest), to the architecture (utilitarian Communist versus fanciful Gothic), to the government (Democratic in theory, Communist-like in practice) and beyond, the Hungarian capital is a study in contrasts. It would be too easy to dismiss Budapest as just another \"pretty\" central European city without Zoltan's guidance. To do so would be a shame as you would miss out on all of the comical absurdity (Absurdistan indeed, Zoltan!) that gives this city (and its people) its charm.I like to include a Pros and Cons list in my reviews, so it is...Pros-Fast response time: Zoltan replied to all of my emails quickly-Individualized: Zoltan works very hard to tailor each tour to what the individual/group is looking for. He asked us a series of questions to tease out information about our personalities, likes/dislikes, travel goals, etc. and used this to personalize our experience. For example, knowing that I am a nurse, he was sure to include little bits of information about the state of health and health care in Hungary.-Private: a private tour is private? What? This may be stating the obvious, but we have been on private tours in which the group size was limited but not truly private. While I enjoy the dynamic of small groups, it was a treat to have Zoltan all to ourselves. -Relaxing: Zoltan walks at a leisurely pace and is very patient. He encourages you to stop and explore, take pictures, ask questions, and really notice your surroundings. This, more than anything else, was what I was looking for as my life is too busy, rushed, hectic, etc. -Value: you really get great value for your money. I cannot emphasize this enough. Spending the day with Zoltan immediately felt like spending the day with a dear friend. There is no agenda, no script, no visits to souvenir shops where the tour guide gets a percentage of the profits. What you pay for is a private tour. What you get is an educated, intelligent, kind, patient, funny, compassionate person with a genuine commitment to providing a quality experience. Cons (here's where it gets ugly!)...-None. That's right, none. I do most of my research before trips on TripAdvisor. I have booked all of the tours I have been on based on reviews from this website and have yet to be disappointed. My husband and I are pretty easy to please so we often struggle with finding something to put on our Con list. Zoltan made us feel like VIPs and the only regret I have is not spending more time drinking and eating with him! Take the tour, tip Zoltan handsomely (he has a very hungry son in college!), and enjoy your stay in Budapest!Pictures will hopefully be added later when I finally upload them to the computer ;-)"

For a city steeped in Jewish history I was a little put off by how they swept the once vibrant life of the Jewish community away. Before we met with Zoltan the only time Jews in the city were mentioned was on the Hop On Hop off bus where the Pest Ghetto was described as \"where 70,000 Jews survived during WWII.\" That was the only mention on a 3 hour bus ride. The next day we had our private tour with Zoltan who met us at our hotel. He helped us understand the so much of the history and attitude towards Jews in Budapest, Pre and Post WWII. We did alot of walking, which for our young 3 and 4 year old children was a bit hard, but Zoltan was amazing with them! He also pointed out lots of things the children could even find interesting! I highly recommend him for anyone looking into a tour of Budapest! He was truly 5 stars!!!"

We've been in Budapest just for a few days and for the fact that we've never been there before we wanted to get to know the city by a native guide so we took Rockhoppers - and this was definitely the best decision we could have made! Our tour guide Kalliope is a very funny person and absolutely passionate about the city and the entire country. Her knowledge on Hungary's history, culture and politics is enormous. The tour - which took about five hours - primarily included sights of the Classic tour and was supplemented by Kalliope with other places which were interesting for us. So 'as preparation' for the tour you'll have contact with your guide by email to communicate your wishes and interests. At the day the tour started she picked us up at our hotel and took us directly to the next underground station where we bought a 24-hours-ticket for Budapest's entire public transport (simplest and cheapest way), with which we reached most of the tour's spots. The rest we did by walking. Everything was well-organized! To sum up, I'd like to say that if you really want to get to know Budapest, do it with Rockhoppers! You won't be sorry!!!"

This is not your \"canned\" \"politically correct\" tour. Zoltan is open and honest about how the citizens of Budapest have been affected by their unique history. Honestly, we could have sat and talked to Zoltan all day."

Just spent 2 days in Budapest on customized trip I had arranged by email with Zoltan Nagy.He had gone above and beyond to meet my expectations and arranged a special tour of Dreher Brewery and Martonvasaar . He had researched family history and made contacts for me that I would not have done on my own.His humour, knowledge and organization was exceptional. We were immersed in the culture and thoroughly enjoyed our time . I would highly recommend Rockhoppers and especially Zoltan to anyone wanting a superior tour.Dale Szalay"

We were in Budapest prior to the start of a river cruise which included a city tour of Budapest, so our itinerary was customized to avoid overlap with the river cruise city tour.Zoltan mixed commentary about the various sights in Budapest with deeper insights. For example, we saw some venders at a temporary local Hungarian goods fair in the square next to the the St Stephens Basilica, which also had folk music and dancers. Zoltan pointed out the vendors had another agenda that they were pursuing. We listened a few moments to the event\u2019s spokesman who expressed xenophobic apprehension about goods from abroad.Zoltan\u2019s intent was to present an unvarnished picture of what we saw, a sort of \u201cwarts and all\u201d approach. The downside of looking at things in too realistic a way is that this prism can make things appear stark and foreboding. Zoltan mentioned dark political forces at work on the left and right and seemed weighed down by the lasting effects of Hungary being on the losing side of the two great wars.Zoltan\u2019s commentary was informative and discerning. He was taking cues from our interests and disinterests at various sights and near the end of the tour added an off the beaten track sight, an unadorned Catholic church inside caverns called the Cave Church near the Gellert Baths which my wife liked a lot."

Zoltan managed to make our day and a half tour interesting and entertaining enough that we enjoyed it despite the heat. Zoltan is very willing to work out what you would like to see and do, which allows you to tailor the tour to your specific interests. He is not your typical \"here are the sites of Budapest, aren't they wonderful\" tour guide. He will give you historical perspective, editorialized, if you ask, which we did. He will tell you about life before and after the revolution. We sought a tour that could give us a taste/picture of life in Budapest, with some key sites included. In a day and a half, we knew we couldn't do justice to all there is to do and see in Budapest. We trusted Zoltan to choose some interesting places to see and spend time talking to us about Budapest now and in the past and how he sees its future. We walked down many streets, with Zoltan's commentary. We spent time in both Buda and Pest, and learned some of the differences. We travelled by bus/tram, subway and foot. It was fun seeing the city from those venues, and we liked experiencing the modes of transportation for most people who live and/or work there. Both were quite efficient. Zoltan's knowledge is both broad and deep. He is a thoughtful and perceptive intellectual. In fact, he predicted some of the events that have occurred in Hungary since July. If you want a tour that hits all the usual sites, with the typical hype, Zoltan and Rockhoppers may not be right for you. However, if you are interested in an intellectual perspective of Budapest from a knowledgeable guide who looks at the city and its past and future from the perspective of one who has lived there for many years, we would recommend you try Rockhoppers.

It was nice to get a flavor of the towns surrounding Budapest, and the Roman ruin museum was quite interesting if you enjoy history.There's so much to love about the tour, but my favorite part of the day was dinner in the evening. Zolton took us to a delicious Hungarian restaurant (the restaurant was also a winery, which is always a bonus). The setting was lovely, the host was very welcoming, and the food was memorable (and very reasonably priced). I highly recommend ending your tour with a stop at this restaurant.Zolton was a very gracious host the entire day. As other reviewers have mentioned, Zolton will give you a flavor of the true Hungary, and he won't censure the history or current state of affairs.

It took me some time to pick out a guide from TripAdvisor because I hoping to find a guide that would illustrate to us what a modern Hungarian mindset might be resemble. Lots of the top rated guides in Budapest seemed more \"entertainment\" oriented and therefore, I felt, perhaps staged (?) too much for the tourist crowd. Rockhoppers' guide Zoltan was thought-provoking and definitely had his own ideas on the Hungarian people and politics. He has a unique perspective as an older gentleman who has had the opportunity to leave Hungary but chose to stay. He presented everything quite subtly though, in a way that just made you think about it and pay attention. I would say that it would help to know a bit about Hungarian history to pick up on this, or it could easily get lost on you.We did the Budapest Classic Tour, but I think the specialty tours would be even more interesting with Zoltan."

I'd recommend Rockhoppers to all who are adventurous and looking for a unique tour experience in Budapest - a great city to visit, by the way, and not overrun by tourists, even in the middle of summer. Over the two days with Zoltan, the back story unfolded of Hungarian history, politics, intrigue, and personal stories, including events involving the Nazi occupation, the Communist regime to follow, and contemporary events. I provided Zoltan a list of sights that I wanted to see, and we built these all into the schedule, as well as many more places. He is very flexible in planning the tours, and yet there was also a lot of spontaneity during the tour, with stops at surprising places, such as the fabulous indoor market, the Chapel of the Cave, and the Hilton Hotel in the Castle district, which contains a little known museum, and ancient ruins from a historic church. We stopped to watch a political march at one point, explored parts of the labyrinth that were not accessible via any tourist map, and on the street met a 10-time Olympic medalist who is an acquaintance of Zoltan's. I also had a chance to ride in his one-of-a-kind Land Rover, which was an experience in itself. I had guided private tours 1-on-1 in 4 European cities this past July, and the Rockhoppers experience was the probably the most unique and memorable - in large part due to Zoltan's incredible knowledge of Budapest (he grew up in the Castle district) and willingness to share insights and personal stories. You can look forward to a tour that exceeds all expectations, and some surprises, and a glimpse of the real Hungary, away from the facade of a traditional tourist company that wants to show just the sanitized version of Budapest. The best of the best in tour experiences! By the way, I recommend the Kempinski Hotel Corvinus in Budapest as your base of operations - terrific in all respects!"

I love to see the picture of Zoltan sitting down with my daughter on the staircase inside the Mosque and talked to her and answer her questions. Just like grandpa and grand daughter. A lovely picture in my mind that I will not forget. Zoltan also wait patiently for us to translate the information to the elderly. Thank you very much again Zoltan!He told us not just the basic historical and cultural background of the attractions, but the good, the bad, and the ugly.

I travel a good bit, and almost always arrange for a private tour when I visit a place for the first time. Friends of mine recommended Zoltan's company based on their experience with another guide a few months ago. Zoltan was incredibly knowledgeable, insightful, flexible, and focused on making sure that my expectations for my tour were met.After meeting up, Zoltan asked what I was interested in. I'm not sure my answer was coherent, but I tried to convey that I was incredibly curious, interested in history, interested in modern Hungarian life, not interested in religion, and that I would be keen on having a tour that didn't focus on the typical list of places that one must visit. In short, my request to Zoltan was, \"Show me what you love about Budapest. Show me what you hate about Budapest. I want to hear interesting stories and get a sense of the place.\"Without much more than that, we set afoot and walked the city. I got great history lessons, learned bout Hungarian politics, discussed demography and sociology, saw interesting sites, and spent a fun time with a cool guy and got a glimpse into a life well lived. We also had coffee, Hungarian disgestifs, and an adventure in the West End mall trying to find an adapter for an American electrical plug.In short, I got exactly what I wanted. My request may have been unconventional, but Zoltan delivered. After a half day together, I left feeling like I'd scraped the surface of Budapest and Hungary and I wanted to know and experience more. It was the kind of introduction that will set me up for a lifetime of visits and learning, which is so much more valuable than just ticking the tourist-trap boxes."

That is what you get with Zoltan. Don't get me wrong, you get to see all the \"normal\" sights of Budapest, but woven into your time are stories and experiences that give you a more grand and realistic view of this amazing city. Zoltan is brilliant and has lived to see the many changes that have occurred so his knowledge of the people, architecture, and history was spot on. We ate in restaurants that were amazing but local and inexpensive. We saw how the everyday people live in this city. He helped us navigate the subways and buses and by the time we were to leave we felt like we had a grasp of the city thanks to him. We spent 3 days with Zoltan and it was by far the best experience of all the cities and tours we did."

This was a special trip to celebrate our big birthdays! We specifically requested Zoltan as we did have an inkling that he would be able to handle 7 sexagenarian women - and he definitely could. We benefited from a personalized tour with someone of a similar age (!) who was very charming and knowledgable. As it is tailored to your interests, you will benefit most if you have some ideas of your own to contribute and he will accommodate your requests and your questions (we had many). Budapest is a wonderful city and Hungary has a very fascinating, if troubled and mixed up history so it is definitely worth spending a bit on getting a real insight into the good, the bad and the ugly. Other tours in Budapest tended to rely on the automated headphone commentary in a range of languages but nothing beats the personal touch. There was no clock watching and we definitely got more than the \u2018half day\u2019 we expected. Wonderful weather helped to make this the highlight of our short trip for sure."

This was certainly one of the highlights of our trip. Zoltan is so polite and knowledgeable about the history of Hungary and Budapest during the Communist times because he lived there during it and could provide a great personal perspective. We enjoyed the trip out to the communist memento park on the outskirts of the city in Zoltan\u2019s rugged and well traveled Land Cruiser. He is able to provide great insight into what was happening in the country during the Communist Era as well as the political and ideological thought of the country today.It is clear Zoltan loves Hungary, and loves telling other about its history. Around every corner of Budapest, Zoltan was able to point out something significant and historical and was able to tie everything together throughout the day. We ended at a fine restaurant for lunch where we were able to decompress and talk about our time. It would be easy to spend an entire day with Zoltan, but if you\u2019ve only got half a day, I\u2019d highly recommend spending it with him and learning more about Hungary\u2019s rich history and future."

Yes, we went past the main sites and got the stories but he also included his personal views on the history, politics and culture of Budapest and Hungary, having lived through the Communist era and seen many changes, so we had a chance to think about things beyond the typical glossy guide book views.

It gives you the feeling as if the mid-ninetieth century were all poured on you. This is the area where the Orthodox \u201cpenguin\u201d lives together with the colourful youngster, the Arabic kebab maker and hairdresser and also the noisy Gypsy. It is the most exciting part of the city of Budapest. There is everything here from the dance schools to the theatres that a city may need. When you turn to the Dob Street, the past falls on you: every courtyard inside is at least 150 years old! Let\u2019s don\u2019t forget that the last 150 years included everything that the history of Hungary could include. Zoltan speaks about every house as his own old acquaintance or friend. The story that the peripheral Jewish sites slowly turned to prosperous areas together with their architectural miracles that had been first destroyed by the German and later by everyone that ever appeared there\u2026. The major streets are beautiful now, but when you turn to side streets, you will be encountered with the bullet-holes from 1944 and also 1956. You will shed teardrops when walk to the playground of Klauz\u00e1l Square where the mass graves used to be, and where there is a playground for little kids and also dogs now. This is the area where my grandpa and grandma used to live, this is where the dead corpses were transported by horse carts, and where the charity kitchens cook the menu for the homeless on weekends."

Most tours have a script and a checklist, Zoltan does not believe in this and tailor makes the tour for your interests. We wandered around in so many inner courtyards , where the domestic side of the Jewish quarter life is seen, with the red marble staircases, limestone and brick foundations, and inner balconies. The synagogues come to life not as just a tourist destination but a living breathing experience where the breakfast dishes were still on the table at the school overlooking the temple. Zoltan grew up here, he knows this area as only a local can, with humorous anecdotes about what you see. His level of knowledge of history , architecture, and culture is truly amazing. No topic, including politics ( if you so choose) is off limits. The experience is not rushed, but with several stops to sample the local food and drinks such as palinka (Brandy). I have traveled all over the world and been on many, many tours in my life, Zoltan redefines what a tour should be. It is obviously his passion to share his knowledge of Budapest and Hungary with you, and it becomes infectious. If you want to take a tour of Budapest, book Zoltan!"

Timi showed up at our hotel on time, and quickly helped us get our bearings around the city and public transport. The tour was above and beyond what Eric and I asked for- she took us, at our request, to one or two of the popular (albeit touristy) spots, but more often to areas you could tell were near and dear to her heart that showed the real people of the city- Jewish historical sites, beautiful walks with locals strolling, fantastic restaurants. We took another private tour later that week in Prague, and while good, it made us appreciate Timi's tour so much. She never once made us feel like tourists, but rather as friends that she wanted to share her city with. Prime example- after meals at 2 great restaurants (her recommendations), I shot her an email asking for one more. She went out of her way to make a reservation. When we arrived that night (not having checked our email through the day) the hostess regrettably informed us that they were all booked... but Timi had asked the hostess to pass along a message that she'd made ANOTHER reservation at a place down the street. We were floored- she went so out of her way! Needless to say, we can't wait to go back. She made our trip so memorable! Thanks Timi!!"

After that we went to a local bar, a must see too Szimpla Kent. After the bar we did a tour of the city. Normally we were going to eat at the Szimpla but Zoltan toke us to a restaurant outside the city. I recommend everybody who goes on tour with Zoltan to make him take you there you will love it.Zoltan Is a guide that has a lot of knowledge of the city and knows the little thing you would not get in a normal tour. Great tour and a super guide Loved it Thanks Zoltan!!! "

Myself and my wife travelled to budapest in the afternoon on Wednesday and I had already booked the budapest classic tour with rockhoppers, first through Zoltan and then when we gave the date with Timea who would be our guide, so we set out at 10am on the Thursday with Timea. We had been emailing back and forth for sometime about our likes and dislikes and any question I asked was responded to promptly and politely, timea also had many recommendations for things to do and see whilst we were in the city. She arranged to meet us in the lobby of our hotel (palazzo zichy) which made things a lot easier and also meant that we could learn things we didn't know through the area which we were staying.I can't speak for my wife but as for myself I was quite nervous about meeting someone in person who I had only communicated with through email but Timea soon put me at ease, it was like we had know her for some time.One of the best things about the tour for me was that we would just stop and go into random buildings in which we wouldn't usually stop and we would get to see what local people did day to day, which having a Hungarian grandfather I never knew; was nice  I had requested to learn about the hungarian uprising and sure enough Timea could show me key buildings involved and tell me stories about it, truly the tour is customised to each individual and as per my wife's request we were able to stop in a tiny hidden coffee house and try some unique draft coffee, we also stopped in gerbaud and looked at the lovely cakes and chocolate to which later in the holiday we returned and bought a selection. Throughout the tour which was structured excellently and flowed perfectly we saw many of the main sights if not all, not bad for a half day tour, these include the great synagogue, St Stephens basilica including going up the tower to see all of budapest (an amazing view.)We also saw parliament, matthias church, fishermen's bastion, chain bridge and vaci utca and others I'm sure. Another important part of the tour was the use of public transport in Budapest.Included in the price was a 24hr travel pass for use within the city limits which Timea had bought with her and so we were shown how to use the metro and the bus system which most definitely helped for the rest of the holiday and gave us tremendous confidence.Like I said previously I was impressed with how the tour flowed, even when we made stops here and there we still finished the tour on time and right where was agreed at the start which was on the buda side by the royal palace.Through my time with Timea and stay in Budapest I was able to learn a few hungarian words which came in handy when on Friday morning we left budapest and travelled to kecskemet for a brief football related stop, I eventually felt confident enough to try and speak a bit of it at times.Trying to remember every detail of the tour is hard as we saw a great deal and learned a lot of information but as I had requested we visited a small local market on the tour and stopped here for some excellent but filling l\u00e1ngos, which we loved.I'm sure I've missed something out but it's early morning so forgive me but in conclusion we greatly enjoyed our budapest classic tour with Timea and when we return to the beautiful budapest I shall request another tour with Timea as our guide.Thank you so much Timea"

Prior to the tour, Zoltan answered my emails promptly which was appreciated. Additionally, I found his tour pricing very reasonable.Zoltan is a little older than some tour guides which I specifically wanted for Budapest because he had lived during the Communist occupation and I wanted to hear from someone who understood that time.He was waiting for us at the train station when our train pulled in late. The day of the tour it was raining which I wasn't crazy about but when you only have a day to see the city, you suck it up. Zoltan had an umbrella for me which I much appreciated.We spent a fair amount of time in the Jewish quarter with Zoltan. One thing he does is show you the good, the bad and the ugly. I felt I got a real view into Hungary not a whitewashed one. A motto he has is - if you see an open door, Walk through it. Many times we were in a neighborhood and we'd just walk into a building to see what the architecture was like and/or chat up the residents. We went into this old-time barbershop that the owner's father had owned from the '40s - it was cool.He brought us to a wonderful Jewish restaurant in the Ghetto that had fantastic food. I had duck breast with pumpkin risotto, I wanted to lick the plate. Needless to say my plate was clean.He took us to a market and I got 2 of these wonderful little leather Hungarian coin purses that you can hang on a purse - mine is on my computer bag which were 10 Euros each. I only regret that I didn't buy more of them as I have had compliments on them already. We saw the American Embassy, the Cave Church as well as other goverment buildings and monuments.It was a full day by the time Zoltan dropped us off at the train station at 6:30 PM.My husband and I enjoyed our day with him and I highly recommend him."

Our group, though small, consisted of family aged 14-70. Every one of us raved about our experience with Zoltan. He has forgotten more about this incredible city than most will ever know and was able to bring the city to life for us in a way that a large group tour simply would not have. In addition to being informative, his sense of humor made the experience even better.When deciding where to go with him and what places we should explore on our own, he was very careful to listen to our interests and guide us to places we would have missed otherwise. And, due to our limited number of days in Budapest, we was also incredibly insightful directing us away from sites that would not be as pleasant of an experience overall. From site-seeing, to restaurant recommendations, to transit-travel to bringing this historic city to life, we highly recommend Zoltan's services!"

Zolton was not the kind of tour guide that points out every architectural detail or fact about every building or art work that we passed on our tour. Instead he provided an overview of the complicated and often confusing political history of Hungary. We especially found interesting his perspective on Hungary's role during WW2 and the post war Communist era. Zolton is passionate about history, politics, food and drink. He was very generous and we got to try local sausage, cheese and a Hungarian Brandy (at 10 am in the morning!). This was not a fast paced tour where we got to see all of the sites in a day, rather it was a leisurely exploration of the cities' cultural and political history. Both my husband and I feel like Zolton gave us a great gift in better understanding a country that we had previously known nothing about."

She was accommodating when we wanted to stop at a Gelato place we had heard about and she showed us a lot of Budapest in a small amount of time which was great.

He has a fascinating lineage, much like Hungary itself, and he's a bit irreverent, but a most pleasant and nonchalant manner. Leaf through his website and you will get a good feel for Zoltan. He informed us of the vast contradictions of a country of assimilated people who are searching for a Hungarian identity. Hungary is a democracy that is becoming less democratic. Unfortunately, the right wing anti-semitism is once again rearing its ugly head. The nation that has recently reduced its mandatory education requirements, with a Premiere who prefers the governing style of China, Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkenistan and has refashioned the recently adopted Constitution numerous times to suit himself.This is not your typical rushed tour, but a chance to stop and smell the \"roses\" and indulge in the local wine and plum brandy with the locals. He helped us navigate Budapest's public transport and finished our tour with a stop at a ruin bar and finally an impromptu stop at Liberty Square, where you can learn the entire history of Budapest and see its revisionist history first hand.Zoltan's deep dive into Budapest will keep you thinking and provide you with a most unique experience."

She kept adding and adding to our day, and back in Budapest near twilight took us to the best sites of Buda overlooking the Danube as darkness fell, explaining site after site we had only seen via riding the hop on/off bus tours: the Citadella, castle, Gellert mountain and even a private peek into the famous Gellert baths, all narrated with expertise and again, a seemingly endless depth of knowledge and delight.

During our 2013 visit to Budapest and while spending \u201cThree days with Zoltan\u201d, we realised what a fantastic tourist destination the Hungarian capital was. No wonder we decided to include Budapest once more this year while visiting one of the neighbouring countries.Well, who was the first person to know about our second visit to Hungary? Zoltan, of course!This time we had a \u201creal Hungarian\u201d rather than a \u201ctourist\u201d experience in mind. We asked Zoltan to let us know about any Hungarian celebration /festivity that would be on the calendar during July in or around Budapest.Zoltan immediately sent website information of the \u201cInternational Palace Games\u201d presented once a year in Visegrad. We bought tickets on the internet for the opening day of the Games and booked our seats on the hydrofoil from Vigado Square in Budapest. Zoltan agreed to meet us in Visegrad.We reached Visegrad boat station at 10h30. It was heart warming to see Zoltan (with his cap) sitting like a sentinel on a rock wall with his trusty Land Rover parked close by.Zoltan helped us overcome all the logistical problems during our day in Visegrad. The weather was not quite what we expected. We left Budapest in a drizzle and although there was no rain by the time we reached Visegad, the temperature and humidity was quite high!The \u201cPalace Games\u201d would only start at 14h30 and we had time to drive uphill and visit the Citadel. We wandered around the museum to see what life was back in the early days of the kings. From the top we had the best view of the Danube Bend. (During our 2013 visit we could only see the Citadel and Danube Bend from the deck of our cruise ship.)Back down in town, Zoltan parked his Land Rover at the caf\u00e9 where we enjoyed lunch. From the caf\u00e9 we strolled along the streets lined with stalls selling crafts and food. Actors walking around wearing Medieval costumes made a huge contribution towards a wonderful historic carnival atmosphere. Zoltan as our personal historian-tour guide and interpreter-translator made the \u201cPalace Games\u201d an even more memorable experience!Zoltan walked his usual extra mile: We had to catch a bus from Nepliget station early the next morning. Zoltan immediately made arrangements with a trustworthy taxi-friend who met us at 05h15 at our accommodation. Zoltan also made a phone call to the office at the bus station to obtain certain information.Late afternoon we headed towards Budapest. On the way we made a stopover at the Schieszl Restaurant. Excellent wine from their own cellar complemented our Hungarian meals. Zoltan arranged a quick visit to the restaurant cellar and kitchen. We insisted using our multi-day public transport tickets and Zoltan dropped us at a HEV train station.Thank you, Zoltan, for a perfect day \u2013 summer downpour and all!Back home we found an email sent by Zoltan and added to it an album full of pictures! What a pleasant surprise!"

Our guide, Kalliope, emailed us beforehand to find out what our interests were so she could tailor the tour for us. She was incredibly knowledgeable about Budapest and gave us insightful history and context every step of the way. We got to see the main tourist sights, learned the subway and tram systems and heard some fascinating stories about Budapest. Her love of the city was infectious and we loved our tour! She even spent extra time with us afterwards to give us ideas on other \"must sees\" we could go see on our own. Loved this tour!"

I am in Budapest for the first time with my best friend, and we were looking for a tour to help introduce us to the city and Hungarian culture, to get oriented. We had SUCH a great experience with Kalliope from Rockhoppers Tours. As a native of Budapest, her knowledge of the city and Hungarian history and culture is amazing. We went all over the Pest and Buda sides of the city, saw tons of sights and got oriented to the public transportation system and some basic Hungarian language skills. Kalliope very generously helped us plan the rest of our stay in Budapest at the end of our tour. I can't recommend her highly enough! We had a wonderful experience and hope you will, too!"

On our second visit to Hungary in June 2014 we have again engaged Zoltan Nagy the guide whom we met two years ago.This time he drove us to Szentendre, an interesting village north of Budapest, and on to Visegrad, an ancient ruined castle overlooking the Danube. He told us the history of the places which we found very interesting. Next day he took us to the Herend Porcelain factory, North of Lake Balaton and also to Veszprem which is a very old historic town prominent in Hungarian history. We recommend visiting both places allowing a full day.The following day Zoltan drove us to north of Hungary and across the border to Kosice in Slavakia where we stayed the night. The next day we visited St Elizabeth Cathedral and the crypt. Inside the crypt is the tomb of Ilona Zriny and Ference Rakoczi II (Mother & Son). We also visited the Rakoczi Museum which is a replica of the house Prince Rakoczi lived in whilst in exile in Turkey. Note: this museum is closed on a Monday. Kosice was one of the highlights of our visit and we would highly recommend a visit to this interesting old town.We then drove to Eastern Hungary to Sarospatak where Zoltan left us for a few days while he himself returned to Budapest. We visited the Rakoczi Museum castle (impressive) and House of St Elizabeth museum. The St Elizabeth Cathedral was closed for renovation. Comenius Kollegium of Theological Studies Library is also well worth visiting.We returned to Budapest by train where we met Zoltan who drove us to Esztergom to St Paul\u2019s Basilica. On the way we turned off to a small village where an ancient monastery stood. Only the foundations remained in a very pleasant setting. St Paul\u2019s Basilica at Esztergom is huge and very impressive. We also visited the big underground crypt. We had lunch in the restaurant complex associated with the Basilica, built with brick arches/domes. Estergrom is \u2018breathtaking\u2019 and well worth visiting. Allow one day to enjoy the town as well.We highly recommend Zoltan Nagy who is a professional guide for his expertise and knowledge of history. Zoltan was formerly a Professor in Ancient Studies at the Budapest University and has also published books on Tibetan Buddhism."

He was very responsive and arranged our itinerary based on our interest. We travelled with two boys and Zoltan made sure that they have a great time in Budapest as well. First day we travelled in countryside of Budapest in his own vehicle. He explained to us history of Budapest, present situation and make us experience local feast. Next day we asked him to take us to not so touristy places and he exactly did it. He was always on time, always looking after our comfort and making sure that we have a memorable trip. I give Zoltan five stars. Thanks Zoltan for showing us good time in Budapest."

We are a family of 5 from Canada and we spent 2 days in Budapest at the end of August.Based on the reviews on Tripadvisor I hired Zoltan as a private tour guide to see some of the major historic sites of the Hungarian capital. Let me tell you we were NOT disappointed for sure. He met us at Hosok plaza where we parked our car and we spent 5 hours walking around the city and also used public transportation to get around town. Zoltan is very knowledgeable about the hungarian history and Budapest itself and speaks excellent english. The tour itself was very relaxed and enjoyable. At the end of the day he gave us directions to the hotel we stayed at and guided me back to the car. I would highly recommend Zoltan to anyone visiting Budapest, you won't be disappointed."

Zoltan is exetremely knowledgeable about Budapest and its surrounds. What came across most to us was his own joy in exploring not only the city but the countryside outside of the city. My husband and I both like immersing ourselves in the cities or towns we travel to. Zoltan and Kalli provided the best of both worlds, immersion with a lot of laughs and fun.

This time, we asked Zoltan to take us to Eger, a city about two hours outside of Budapest. Eger is known for its wines and beautiful landscape. I asked Zoltan to come up with an itinerary for my family that included my wife, two kids ages 18 and 20 and my mother. Once again, Zoltan came through with an amazing itinerary that included Eger and Lillifured. Given that my mother was travelling with us this time, he hired a driver to take us on this full day tour that began at 9:00 AM and lasted late into the evening. Taking a tour with Zoltan is like traveling with a friend. He is interested in giving you an experience that will not soon be forgotten. Zoltan is a tour guide that does not look at his watch to make sure he is finished at 5PM, instead ends the tour when we covered all of our sites. And in our case, was very late into the evening. During our trip to Eger, we visited a place where they smoked fresh trout, which was absolutely delicious, visited a castle, and had dinner at a remote town that I can't recall but was delicious. The sites were incredible and breathtaking with beautiful waterfalls, and countryside that is some of the nicest I have come across in my travels. Once again, Zoltan went out of his way to make our trip to Hungary amazing. The kids enjoyed his company and conversation as did my mother. I miss Hungary and the family already misses Zoltan. We look forward to going back to Hungary again and most certainly will use Zoltan for a third time. We will once again toast with Palinka and a cold beer."

We travelled to Budapest last year for our one year wedding anniversary and we still regularly reminisce about our time with Zoltan. We spent two fabulous days with this wonderfully intriguing Hungarian. Full of random facts about everything, this is the way to see Budapest and Hungary in all it's glory from a man full of enthusiasm and humour. Not only will he revel in the wonder that is historical Budapest but he will also be brutally honest about its failures and darker side. He quickly tailors the tour to suit your interests and personality and by the end of the two days we felt like I had known him for years and were catching up with an old friend. Boring tourist cattle mart this is not. Individualised, bespoke and from the heart this is. We love you Zoltan! We promise to come back soon, Jo and Steve Phillips"

One of the highlights of our trip was the tour that we had with Zoltan. This was a tour about life under communism, but it proved to be much more.We began with a ride to Memento Park. The statues were essentially prompts for discussions about the communist regime, the Arrow-Cross years, contemporary politics, art, the creation of a politically useable past, and daily life in Hungary. Lest this sound ponderous or boring, let me clearly state that my 16 year old daughter and my skeptical father, found Zoltan to be a wonderfully engaging, funny, and informative raconteur. This was not a tour, but an extended conversation with an interesting and thoughtful man that included Palinka and sausage. We returned to the city, specifically, Liberty Square, for more interesting and disturbing discussions. The square is currently the site of some contention over the construction of a monument memorializing the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany. There is a counter and impromptu monument documenting Hungary\u2019s direct role in the Holocaust. Seeing the juxtaposition of these starkly competing histories, in a square that was so vibrantly alive with locals, dogs, and tourists, really underscored the problem of living with one\u2019s past."

She set us up with an eveing cruise of the Danube with all its lighted spendor from the buildings along the shore. She met us the next day for a 3 hour walking tour of the city which we found to be enlighting and informative. So much to that point that she continued on with us for 4 more hours. Her love and knowledge of all things Budapest past and present kept the morning/afternoon interesting and fun. If you are ever thinking of siteseeing in Budapest be sure and set up a tour with Calliopie of Rockhoppers,"

I had a fantastic half a day with Zoltan, whose knowledge and passion for the city is amasing and infectious. I arrived knowing absolutely nothing about Hungary or Budapest and this was certainly not the case after my tour with Zoltan. Zoltan showed me the city and introduced me to a plethora of sights and stories that I would have otherwise missed. It was not like ordinary mainstream tours but more like spending the day with an old friend. I walked away having had a history, politics and language lesson amidst interesting conversations and relaxed wandering. The tours are tailored to individuals and the email correspondence prior to my visit was great to discuss what I would like to see and know and this was certainly taken into account during the tour. I would most definitely recommend that anyone visiting Budapest to take this tour and I hope to visit Budapest in the future and that Rockhoppers are still taking tours!!!"

After a welcome by three guides from Rockhoppers, we were divided into small groups. It was a wonderful idea as we were all able to hear our guides and ask questions. No following the lady in the pink parka with an umbrella for us. We started our 3 hour city tour with a trip to an interesting watering hole for a taste of local brandy. Our guide, Zoltan, was charming and extremely knowledgeable. He took us to see the sights and was able to tell us about history, local politics, gypsies and was full of fun and energy. In addition, he took photos which he emailed to us. We were having such a wonderful time that Zoltan agreed to stay with us for the day. The following day Rockhoppers arranged a boat tour on the Danube and Eva explained to us the sites that we were passing. In addition to the tours, Rockhoppers recommended restaurants and even located a tack shop for me. If I ever return to Budapest, I will contact Rockhoppers to continue seeing the many sights in Hungary."

For some unfathomable reason, Zoltan seemed to focus on talking about Hungry's political failures and the country surge in neo-Nazis groups (I later learned from others that this may have been intentionally exaggerated). Our group was mainly Jewish, with me being one of the exceptions as a Black person. Upon beginning the tour, Zoltan recommended that we have a shot a Palinka, a Hungarian liqueur; when we all agreed, Zoltan seemed surprise by my acceptance and made it clear that he thought that I, the only Black person in the group, was Muslim and therefore should not be drinking alcohol. After nearly three hours and barely half way into the tour, half of our group decided to leave early and did not stick around for the end of the tour. The one bright spot was Zoltan's assistant, Ava, who had given our group a shorter tour the day before. Ava was extremely pleasant and professional. Individuals would be better served getting a guide book and walking around Budapest at there own pace."

Our guides spent the entire day with us and then, beyond the call of duty (as well as contractual understanding), accompanied us to a restaurant to help interpret the menu and recommend dishes; joined us for an evening boat ride on the Danube, and escorted us to a neighborhood church for a chamber music concert.

My guide, Zoltan, arrived at the hotel and took a few minutes to discuss the day's itinerary. It was insightful as it prepared me to anticipate the day's activity. We began in Budapest for a tour of the historic center followed by a tour of the Jewish Quarter. The city's history and the architecture of its buildings left a impression that I still recall today after all of these month's. In the afternoon we took a drive to the countryside which enhanced my experiences of my day's visit as well. It added to the experience so I gained a perspective of Budapest's surroundings. Lunch at a neighboring restaurant in the countryside was a surprise; the meal and restaurant's setting were authentic. On a separate note plan to a concert at the Opera House; the building is incredible."

My wife and I just came back from a long weekend in Budapest and we were lucky to have both sunshine and the excellent company of guide Zoltan from rockhoppers. Zoltan, early sixties, a former professor in Tibetian and Mongolian cultures - is deeply knowledgeable about all things Hungarian- history, architecture, current political scene, pre/post Soviet life etc. We hired Zoltan for a walking tour of Budapest focused on architecture (as the city has many art nouveau, art deco, and baroque buildings). As we zigzagged through both Pest and Buda our architectural tour included a vista to a great Ruin Bar for some palinka, a very interesting tour of the former Jewish ghetto (a great matzo ball soup), walks through back alleys that took us into 19th century courtyards (Zoltan either knows owners or somehow has security codes to get in), discussions about current social and political issues in Hungary (of which there are many ). I have no hesitation in giving Zoltan my top marks and highly recommend him as a guide- at the end of the day its as if you spent the day with a very good friend who knows a lot about a lot. In terms of some style attributes Zoltan is a very good listener. We first sat down in the morning to talk over the day and after he got some sense of our interests he filled in our itinerary. The pacing was leisurely but after a day with Zoltan we felt we had a much better understanding of not only Budapest but modern Hungary. What also makes the day truly enjoyable is Zoltan has an excellent sense of humor and a real talent for telling a story. We had lots of good laughs throughout the day and it was our view the Zoltan is not bored by his job- he gets energy from sharing his city and country with guests .Our tour was in English and from my perspective he is fluent. A very good trip significantly enhanced by the time spent with Zoltan from rockhoppers."

Given the numerous positive reviews on Tripadvisor, I reached out to Rockhoppers to book a tour. We weren't disappointed. Zoltan was our guide and he started us off with an overview of the city and its history before hitting the street to see all the sites. Beforehand I had told him that I am interested in architecture and culture, and he didn't disappoint. We saw a mix of cultural and architectural landmarks, but also stopped in a Hungarian coffee shop for a pastry and coffee, and a ruin bar (an eclectic bar set in formerly abandoned 19th and 20th Century buildings). In the afternoon, we crossed under the Danube to the Buda side and went to Buda Castle, before stopping for lunch at a wonderful fish restaurant. We would have never known to find all the little delightful places Zoltan took us to and it was well worth it to have him with us. If I go back to Budapest I'll definitely use Zoltan again and will try one of the other unique tour offerings, like the Gypsy Village tour. Thanks again Zoltan for a wonderful trip!"

To help us do that, we knew just a \"regular\" tour with many people, showing the same old sites wouldn't work for us. We saw the wonderful reviews for Rockhoppers Tours on here and knew it was the one. We contacted Zoltan (who in turn put us in contact with Aliz) and she immediately started asking questions about what we had seen, what our interests were, what language(s) we spoke, what foods we liked (one of us is vegetarian!), how long we were staying, etc. On the day of our tour, she met us promptly (the lobby of our hotel - what service!) and started right away with the tour. It was clear how much she loves Budapest and knows of its history and culture. She took us to the \"off the beaten path\" places we would never have stumbled upon on our own. She willingly (and without missing a beat), changed the route of our tour if something interested us more and we wanted to spend more time exploring an area or site. She easily answered our endless questions. She was invaluable in helping us navigate the wonderful public transportation system so that later that week, we felt comfortable using it ourselves. She even offered us pronunciation tips to help us in our attempt to learn the language. She was generous with her time (our tour ended up to be just over 4 hours when we originally thought only 3 would be enough!). She is indeed like a very gracious hostess who welcomes you into her city and never leaves your side during the entire tour. Although we don't have plans to return to Budapest in the near future, it is on our list to vacation again."

He will show you the main attractions, of course, but he delights (and distinguishes himself) in taking visitors to the unusual, but still important and meaningful, destinations. The guest's experience is always his focus, and he insists on adapting and changing the itinerary if it is not satisfactory.Caveat emptor: Zoltan isn't a guide for those who want to walk the tourist trails and then leave. But if you want to engage with Budapest in all its sights, sounds, smells, and tastes; if you want to eat (and drink) like a local; if you want to go at a more relaxed pace than the frenetic package tours, then you can do no better than to hire Zoltan.

At his suggestion, we had a \"when in Rome/Budapest\" experience, and shared a schnapps at around 11:00 am (it was, after all, very cold and rainy). Truly, we had never shared a moment like this with a guide, who clearly wants you to feel and experience his city as he does. We loved going to the Baths and despite the unfortunately miserable weather we had that day, Zoltan made the most of it and we saw everything and more, than we could have hoped for on this day. Go and Book this Tour NOW! You will regret not doing so!!!Thanks Zoltan! Pam & Sy, SF Bay Area"

One of those days was spent touring the Jewish Quarter, and the outskirts of Budapest with Zoltan. The wealth of his knowledge, his great sense of humor, and his love for this city shines thru in your time spent with him We are active people in our late 50's and early 60's and found the pace to be great, the conversation lively, and the value of the experience worth every HUF. If your travels are taking you to Budapest, book some time in advance with this guy... you won't be sorry."

We emailed him a few days prior to arriving in Budapest and he fit us in for a day of touring Budapest, Szentendre, and a dinner at Schieszl. Zoltan picked us up at our hotel and from that point on we had a truly unique view of Budapest. Zoltan knows the ins and outs of the city and gives a unique experience providing honest insight and experiences you would not get with other guides. When we hit a storm of rain in Szentendre, Zoltan changed pace and took us to a medieval fortress with fantastic views. The best part of our tour with Zoltan was dinner with him at Schieszi. A small, family run restaurant and winery outside of Budapest where we were treated to a tour of the kitchen, wine making facilities, and the best meal of our trip. If you want a unique experience from an expert on everything Budapest, Zoltan is your guy!"

He met us at our hotel promptly at 10am. We spoke for about 45 minutes in the hotel before we ever left. It was immediately obvious that he is well spoken, well educated, extremely knowledgeably and personable. It is also evident that he will share all information on any situation in Hungary regardless of the political impact. That is significant as it is obvious that he loves his country. We left the hotel and toured the Jewish section of Budapest. Zoltan was none stop enriching our visit with history and how it related to all parts of Hungarian life. It was such an enjoyable day for us. After the tour we had an enjoyable late lunch and we went our separate ways at about 6pm. We will always cherish our day with Zoltan and we look forward to returning and taking another tour with him. He is truly worthy of the praise he receives on Tripadvisor."

He took us on a tour of the Jewish Quarter and we saw 4 locations from a Chabab and synagogue to the Dohany Street Great Synagogue. It was a easygoing pace with much information passed along as we walked around the city. We learned a lot about Budapest and Hungary in general. Zoltan was interesting and knowledgeable and our son (26) who is is very interested in the political and economic aspects of Hungary was thrilled to be able to glean knowledge and discuss topics with Zoltan.

We walked through Pest and took public transport to Buda where we saw not only the usual sights, but went through the streets and into inner courtyards and stopped for some strudel.

His own thirst for knowledge and understanding remains unquenched, so it's very much an interactive experience.

We visited their museum where many artefacts of domestic and cultural value are exhibited. We arrived to Sarospatak mid afternoon and had a late lunch in a restaurant.After lunch we went to the Sarospatak Castle, which construction took place in the 1640\u2019s. We enjoyed the guided tour through the rooms and secret passageways, which were situated within the walls of the castle. The adjacent museum is full of paintings of the members of the Rakoczi family, the princes of Transylvania. Also, antique furniture was on display. There was much more to see, but time did not permit.Late afternoon we drove back to Budapest. We can recommend Zoltan as a professional guide. His knowledge of history and local customs is remarkable.We plan to return to Sarospatak in 2014 to explore this historical place which stays with one after leaving the place."

He was able to use a code to get into a courtyard of a building to show us what it looked like. He talked about the gypsies and their history and how they now live in Budapest. We visited a farmers market that was located in a ruin bar and had a drink and cheese. We would have never found it on our own. We had lunch in a wonderful restaurant and ate local fare. The next day we left the city and went to the countryside. We had dinner at a wonderful restaurant that produced their own wine. My husband has a prosthetic leg and Zoltan was very mindful about how much he can do and the type of ground he could walk on.

He filled in many of the blanks for us about the history and beauty of Budapest that we had already encountered but not tied together. We spent the bulk of our time walking among the Roman ruins at Aquincum and that provided the perfect launching place to discuss the pre-Roman and post-Roman history of Hungary...but you should not think this is a usual recitation of a country's history! Zoltan's experience as a university professor gives him a perspective and \"delivery method\" that is unique among guides. He is entertaining, engaging and expert. He keeps his narrative moving and continually checks in to make sure you are interested and connected with what he is saying. He is versatile and authentic-meaning the picture he presents of his beloved country is real and includes an honest admission of its flaws and struggles as well as it glories.

As we left the breakfast room we saw a man with a greyish beard and ponytail. \"Could that be Zoltan?\" I asked my husband. \"Well if it's him, he's way too early.\" answered Hubby. My eyes followed the man, but he got into a car with fellow travellers and drove off.The weather was perfect and Hubby and I decided to wait outside, sitting on a low fence wall. We saw someone approaching along the sidewalk of a quiet tree-lined street. We could make out a greyish beard with a straw hat hanging from his neck. He made eye contact and when he spoke, the calm, sensitive way I had grown familiar with through his emails, came through in his voice.It was through his emails that I learnt about his love for the city and country where he was born. His awareness of world news and history also came through. His knowledge and sensitivity towards classical and folk music touched me. He and his wife also take an active interest in gastronomy.On our first day in the new city he helped us overcome some practical barriers: together we walked from our hotel to the nearest ATM, which became \"our bank\" during our 9 day visit; he gave assistance buying our 7-day travel cards; he also familiarised us with public transport.We entered the Castle District through Vienna Gate and got off the bus. On foot Zoltan led us through the meandering little streets and across the squares pointing out small details that would have gone unnoticed without him. We often stopped to admire the beauty of the buildings. We listened to interesting facts and he added colour to the pictures with interesting little stories. Unexpectedly the carillon bells of the Mary Magdalene Tower started playing. What a pleasant surprise!Later we each took a sip of palinka from a bottle Zoltan had dug up from his bag. Following the palinka we enjoyed the cool drinking water from a fountain. Zoltan explained which fountains were meant for drinking water and which not. We never bought any bottled water in Budapest because tap water is also purified for drinking!Zoltan took us to the Roman ruins in the heart of a nearby hotel. It seemed to us he knew everybody and everybody knew him! He later took us to a small bar on a side street where we enjoyed some refreshments. From the way he spoke to the owners we came to the conclusion that they too had known each other for ages!After taking us to the best view point, he led us downhill through the Visivaros, where he grew up. From the Clark Adam Ter we walked along a street which covers a Roman road - one meter below. At a restaurant further down the street we enjoyed a real Hungarian meal - river fish!Later we took a tram across the Szechenyi Bridge. On the Pest side we explored the area around Szent Istvan Basilica and then took the metro along the yellow line. In Andrassy Avenue Zoltan took us to the Opera House, pointing out the unusual paving. He showed us where we could go for a guided tour of the inside of the building.We had an interesting look at the inside of a synagogue and strolled into a ruin bar - something we had never seen before! After a quick look at the Dohany Synagogue we made for the nearest metro station. We had to quickly open our umbrellas and by the time we exited the metro, rain came pouring down. Zoltan escorted us on the short bus trip back to our hotel.Two days later Zoltan met us at our hotel. We took the road in his Land Rover to Komarom, a small town about 100 km from Budapest on the Slovakian border. Zoltan drove through small towns while we listened to all the interesting things he had to say. In the background he had folk music alternating with classical music in the car's CD-player.We were heading for Fort Monostor, an elaborate fortification system on the Danube. Zoltan interpreted whatever the Hungarian guide had to say. It was also good to know what the Russian graffiti on some of the walls was about.All the buildings at the Fort are below ground level with thick layers of soil covering their roofs. We spent hours walking the labyrinth of corridors, the outside terrain and the three small museums. We spent a few nostalgic moments inside the bread museum before we left. Fort Monostor was quite a unique experience!We realized only afterwards that we could have run into trouble travelling to Komarom by train as some of the railway lines had been damaged by the flooding only a few weeks earlier.When we returned to Budapest Zoltan took a different road winding through the forests and farms of the Pilis Hills. It was a real bonus to see the Hungarian countryside.On our third day with Zoltan, he drove us to the Citadel. the history of the monuments and how the statues had been changed is quite remarkable. He took time to translate Hungarian and Russian inscriptions. He is master of several languages!We passed a few street vendors as we walked our way up. At one of the stalls Zoltan pointed out some articles that had been made from bracket fungi. I couldn't help buying one of the articles - very special!Our next stop was at Aquincum, the architectural remains of a Roman town. Zoltan knows the place like the palm of his hand. We welcomed Zoltan's comments on everything we saw because the site is vast and so are the displays inside the exhibition building. Zoltan made us see and understand much more in the available time. Visiting Aquincum is highly recommended!Zoltan made a special stop at the amphitheatre for a final Roman experience.Veli Bej was our final stop. Zoltan offered to show us exactly where the entrance to the bath was. As we walked through the door, he read a notice stating that it had been closed due to flood damage. Fortunately Zoltan knew exactly around which corner to take us so that we could take a picture.It was here that we said goodbye. His last words to us were: \"Please, if you need me for any reason, don't hesitate. Phone me.\" On our second last day in Budapest I urgently needed a doctor. We first tried the hotel reception and a pharmacy, but with no success. At last Hubby decided to call Zoltan. Of course he knew a doctor not far from our hotel. He immediately phoned her and spoke to her personally to explain the situation. Next he spoke to the guy at reception, asked him to order us a taxi and gave the doctor's address. After a thorough examination the doctor prescribed medicine which we got from a pharmacy. Thank you, Zoltan, for walking the extra mile.We were able to visit spots where tour groups do not go and we were never rushed. Zoltan made a vast contribution to the tender feelings we gained towards a magnificent city as well as towards the Hungarians!P and M Johannesburg"

We retained Zoltan to introduce us to the history and culture of Budapest. Zoltan was a superb guide. He does not provide a typical tour with a series of memorized facts and stories- even though he could do so if asked. Instead, Zoltan uses his encyclopedic knowledge of Budapest to create a customized tour that mirrors the interests of a particular group. We opted for two \u00bd day tours. Zoltan, however, spent more than 7 hours with us on the first day. The tour included a trip to the countryside in his Land Rover to enjoy lunch at a small resort on the Danube. The food and conversation were genuine. Zoltan clearly was well known and genuinely liked by the people that we interacted with on our tour. He led us through the Jewish quarter and the important sites of Pest on the first day of our tour. He framed the history of Hungary in a manner that helped us better understand the soul of the City. Zoltan was open to detours, distractions and occasional stops for beer, wine and more conversation. Yet, he was also comfortable with a faster pace if we so desired. On the second day, Zoltan brought us a light breakfast that included some of his favorite Hungarian sausage. We toured Buda using various modes of public transportation. Again, Zoltan had compelling and interesting stories about Buda and its history. When we needed nourishment, Zoltan drove us to a family owned restaurant in a typical neighborhood. He arranged a tour of the wine chambers in the facility. The restaurant featured some unique Hungarian brandies and wine that were produced by the family. After lunch, Zoltan insisted on driving us to a scheduled appointment on the opposite side of the city. He was patient, continued to provide insights into the community and had an intuitive sense as to what would be of interest to my family. Zoltan has a nice sense of humor and was very comfortable with people. Zoltan broke down the personal and cultural barriers and shared with us a truly unique glimpse of Budapest. Zoltan is a must for any one hoping to receive a great introduction to Budapest.."

Doing the tour with Zoltan is an experience by itself. Former professor of Mongolian and Tibet studies (!), extremely knowledgeable about present and past Hungary. But at the same time the tour is not a boring fact reading - he doles only as much as you are willing to accept. Zoltan belongs to a very selected group of individuals with unique ideas and thoughts, but they are not forced on you. All of the above is coupled with a good sense of humor.Despite the very limited time we had, Zoltan was able to include selection of \"must\" destinations, as well as some of the less touristy spots, and a very good (+ affordable) meal in a non-tourist neighborhood restaurant.All in all, Zoltan is a highly recommended tour guide. Thank you for the great day in Budapest !Arie, Larisa, Daniel & Michelle"

No disrespect, but after a couple of weeks observing chair covers and paintings of dead people in castles and museums....it was a great treat to meet somebody who wanted to give you a chance to feel the soul of his city. Zoltan did just that. First he postponed a trip with his wife for a day to take us on our tour. Judy, his wife was such a good sport, she even met us for dinner. He took us for a walking tour of both Buda and Pest....showing us interesting things from places in the Jewish Quarter, Serbian Quarter, Gypsey areas, and to a must see \"Ruin Bar.\" We walked to the main market center, to a number of interesting landmarks regarding which Zoltan had encyclopedic knowledge and wonderful way of sharing that knowledge (much of which from his years as a professor). After about 90 minutes, we jumped into his car (local Gypsy music playing on his radio while we all were stamping our feet and sing out randomly). We were off on a great adventure to a small creek area in a fairly isolated location where we fed a great meal of grilled trout, fish soup, roasted vegetables...all fresh of the ground and out of the nearby river....just fantastic! Time then to go a little further outside the city and for walking a magical village where we saw a marzipan museum with the most amazing manifistations of Marzipan including a life size Michael Jackson, Princess Diana, and hundreds of other scenes from movies and cartoons...then to the (yes you have this right) toilet museum....to a pottery barn, weavers, and many other trades folks with wonderful products. We also got to check out the numerous local churches of many denominations and ethnic varieties...along with the smallest synagogue in the world. From there it was to an amazing castle fort from where we walked around and sawy antiquated items....and then spent time there watching the sunset over the Danube....finally dinner at a wonderful restaurant which has a 5 generation active wine cellar at which they offered us wine tastings and a tour of the winery, before setting us up in a private room of over 100 years of age for a delicious local dinner....what a treat! This was not the end of the night....no Zoltan wanted to show us the most beautiful spot in Budapest to view the splendid lights, bridges and monuments which line the Danube and the hillsides nearby. We also were able to walk the beautifully lit grounds with views that go beyond any description. Finally at 11:30 it was time for home after an amazing day with one of the kindest and patient people I have ever met. How to describe Zoltan? Real, kind, intelligent, caring, adventurous person whp is in tune with his audience....a fun loving person who makes you feel like you have been freinds for years and leaves tears in your eyes as the day comes to an end. I can only hope Zoltan and I can maintain an ongoing relationship.....he is my brother from a different mother!!!!!"

Went first to non tourist working synagogue which was a good start to the tour as it felt used and not just for show but still attractive. Then to the orthodox one. Then the ruined synagogue of those who chose neither side - octagonal and my favourite. Then the reform synagogue which actually has an organ and frankly a real air of altar at the front. Museum attached and of course the mass graves and the memorial garden for WWII Jewish victims and those who helped. Very moving. We also heard lots of stories about the houses in the Jewish quarter and finished up with a lovely Hungarian lunch at a restaurant out of Budapest complete with a tour of their cellar and some really throat catching fruit brandy. Lovely food and wine.Zoltan is an ex Mongolian studies lecturer so that gives you some idea that he is not the usual sort of guide. You do not get a totally rosy picture of Hungary but it is good to get balance. Zoltan was a good host and we enjoyed his company. We also appreciated the time Zoltan took to answer our queries at the time of booking and his suggestions of other things to do. Thanks for a great tour Zoltan."

            "review": "Journeys with Zoltan. We did the Danube Bend with Zoltan and it was quite different to anything I expected after reading the reviews. Having a tour with Zoltan is as much about Zoltan as it is the destination. He is a warm, generous, good-humoured, intelligent but deeply cynical Hungarian. As a guide you not only see the surrounding countryside but have a real sense of Hungary as it is through a unique set of eyes. You will not get any of the hype or luxury that seems typical of most tours today. Instead there is an earthiness that those looking for bubbling enthusiasm may find a little flat. His humour is amongst the driest I have encountered. Zoltan knows Hungary well. He talks about its past and its people with informed authority. We travelled during the floods in Hungary and Zoltan was able to find back roads to each destination where bus groups had abandoned any sense of travel. We also visited a restaurant of Zoltan's recommendation and I have to say the meal was fantastic. I enjoyed talking with Zoltan as much over dinner as I did on the tour. It is these aspects that you get when you book a private tour with someone who knows where they are going. Zoltan also seeks to tailor aspects of the tour to the interests of his travellers. As there were only two of us (down from 4 because of the floods), the per head cost was very high. Considering Hungary as a value-destination, it was not cheap. If you were travelling in a group of five or six, the costs become far more reasonable. I would gladly recommend Rockhoppers but expect depth rather than frills."

I picked Zoltan @ the Rockhoppers from amongst the others listed on TripAdvisor simply because he made me feel confident that he could deliver what he had offered by responding to my initial enquiry in less than 24 hours on a Saturday; and providing an itinerary for my group of ten (aged 18 to 76) with links to the relevant sites containing detail information on the destinations to be visited; the rational for the proposed itinerary; a recommendation on restaurant; and a very reasonable quote. On the day of the tour, Zoltan was quick to develop a close rapport with all members in my group and made every one of us feel comfortable that we were in good hands. Zoltan was very knowledgeable but did not bore us with all the knowledge unless we wanted to. He was also a good listener and attended to all our needs. Schieszl Vendeglo, the restaurant recommended by him, served excellent food, provided great service and was very reasonably priced. We should have left a bigger tip for the boys had we not messed up with the exchange rate - what a shame. All members in my group were very much impressed with the professional standard of Zoltan and agreed that the tour was good value for money."

Choosing him over all of the other selections on Tripadvisor was no easy task. I wondered, \"who is the perfect one?\" Aside from the incredible and highly enthusiastic reviews he has gotten ( I am certain he should be number 1 on Tripadvisor)... reading that Rockhoppers are penguins, and penguins are my husband's favorite animal... I knew that Zoltan's company was for us... and we wanted Zoltan. On day one we toured the Jewish quarter, and we walked and walked and learned huge amounts! We toured Buda the following day; roaming around Castle Hill, steeping ourselves in history, but also getting informed about present day Budapest and Hungary. On our final day, we went to Szentendre, a spot we initially thought we'd skip, but wound up trusting Zoltan and went and LOVED it! At the end of our second day, we went to the outskirts of Budapest and had a wonderful dinner with Zoltan at Szeisl... and as others have commented, we were introduced to Palinka ( a Hungarian schnapps) which we enjoyed very much. When we finally had to leave Zoltan, I found I was saying farewell to a new friend. I hope to see him again in the future, and share another palinka! If you want a truly memorable and down to earth experience, provided by someone who spent most of his life as a professor of history....This is the tour guide for you!!!! Maybe he'll come to L.A. and give us a tour of our home!"

Because we were in Budapest as part of a bigger tour group, Zoltan arranged a day that would meet our time requirements and it was perfect. All communication with Zoltan was efficient and timely. Zoltan is very knowledgable about the area, it's history, and shared many personal experiences. We stopped to see Roman ruins and a stork nest with baby storks. We visited several sites in the Danube Bend including Szentendre, Esztergom, and Visegr\u00e1d, a small castle town in Pest County, Hungary. Zoltan took us to a beautiful little restaurant for wine tasting and supper and then drove us back to our hotel. On the way back, he took the time to stop at a site in Budapest that we wanted to see before our departure the next day. He was patient and accommodating and meet our every need. We had a wonderful day with Zoltan and will definitely book another tour with him if we are lucky enough to return to the area.

We went out to Szentendre and were treated to an 11am Palinka and beer before a spot of shopping and a tour of the village followed by a Langos. As well as being incredibly knowledgeable and funny, what we loved about Zoltan is he doesn't try to paper over the cracks of real life in Hungary. We found this to be very refreshing but might not be to everyone's taste. We went on to visit Visegrad castle before going to Esztergom Basilica- the most insanely huge and gorgeous church, where Zoltan helped us to find graffiti dating back to the 1500s. After that it was on to a restaurant out in the sticks where we were able to taste wine in the cellar, had yet another Palinka and some fantastic food in a beautiful setting. The whole day whizzed by and Zoltan was more than happy to adapt to our interests - not once did we feel rushed or bored. It was not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but worth every penny. We went back to the hotel stuffed with food and more knowledge than we could hope to gain in a week on our own. When we got back to England, Zotlan had put the photos he took on Facebook for us to see too- a really nice souvenir from a very memorable day."

My husband and I visited many cities/countries this summer but our day with Zoltan was one of our favorite!Booking with him before arriving in Hungary was fast, efficient and friendly. We felt comfortable before even meeting him. We booked a day trip to Herend and Lake Balaton. We had such an informative and interesting tour at Herend. Even though we were on a guided tour, Zoltan had several tidbits to add and even helped the guide when she was stuck trying to explain things in English! We enjoyed good coffee and conversation with Zoltan at the Herend Cafe. We then went to lunch at a restaurant in the middle of no where - there is no way a tourist will get there on their own. It was barn style with wooden benches and we had such a great meal there! It was such an authentic and special experience!Afterwards, we walked around Balatonfured and tasted great wines. Thanks to Zoltan's knowledge, we tasted and bought some of the tastiest wines we've had in a long time. During vacation, people rush to see as much as possible and sometimes forget to slow down and soak in the beautiful surrounding. What we appreciated about Zoltan was that he never rushed us. He encouraged us to slow down, take our time and never made us feel like we were on schedule. Rather than trying to fit us in the schedule he had planned for us, the schedule was changed to fit our pace and our mood. It really doesn't get better than that!Most importantly, our day trip with Zoltan didn't feel like a paid trip with a guide, it felt like spending a day with a friend we haven't seen in a while. He was a pleasure to have conversations with, he was knowledgeable about anything to do with Hungary, he's got a great sense of humor and he's very friendly. I can't say enough to recommend Zoltan but I guarantee that you will have a memorable experience with him.Thank you Zoltan for giving us one our most memorable days!"

I read a lot of positive reviews about Rockhoppers and decided to book a tour with Zlotan. Unfortunately, Zlotan is a very busy guide and could only tour with us one day. However, those were the best 7 hours spent. Since we stayed at Kempinski, we started with the tour of jewish quarter and it was fascinating. Zlotan gave us so much information and knowledge about jewish life in Budapest that it would've taken us days to learn on your own. We took a bus to the old Buda town and spent hours walking narrow streets, while Zlotan gave us more historical information about churches, castle and everything surrounding us. We had the most wonderful experience and would recommend Zlotan, who is a former university professor, to anyone who is trying to learn about history and see the majestic sites of Budapest."

            "review": "Not Your Average Tour Guide. We Budapest for four days in June. We spent two of those days touring with Zoltan from Rockhoppers. During our first day, Zoltan treated us to a Jewish tour of Budapest. Zoltan is a former college professor with an inquiring intellect and open personality. He met us at our hotel and we walked to the former Jewish ghetto. Our first stop was a very small active synagogue run by Chabad. Zoltan has befriended the rabbi, the Roma cook and the rabbi's wife. As a result, we were free to spend quite a long time in this now vibrant old synagogue where Zoltan gave us an orientation to the often sad and tragic, but also optimistic history of the Jews of Budapest. From the Chabad house, we then traveled to many other important Jewish sites, including the Great Synagogue and the Synagogue at Rumbach Street. Along the way, Zoltan would stop as his fancy led him and he pointed out many stores and buildings that we would not have noticed without his expert guidance. We stopped for a piece of traditional Jewish cake and a beer at a ruin cafe and ended our first day with lunch at a non-kosher Jewish restaurant. The next day, Zoltan met us at our hotel and led us by foot across the Chain Bridge and then to a bus stop which took us to the castle district of Buda. Since Zoltan knew we were interested in the remains and remnants of the Jewish community, he took us along side trips to highlight Jewish sites even while in this area. Our tour was not rushed, but filled with little details that a larger group tour could not have included (such as the statute of a horse near a local college which has testicles shined bright by the eager students who rub it for luck during finals!) Zoltan gave us an excellent recommendation for dinner our first night and took us for lunch at a wonderful local restaurant on our second day. I highly recommend Rockhoppers Tours of Budapest. Since our visit, we have recommended Rockhoppers already to friends who visited shortly after us. They were also highly pleased. Although we were so glad that Zoltan was our guide, he assures us that the other guides who work with him are all as knowledgeable and interesting as he is."

He has almost encyclopedic knowledge of the history and culture of Budapest and Hungary in addition to insight into the modern day economic and political gains and struggles. He was incredible at reading our group's mood and interests and tailoring the tour to account for the things we would enjoy (and avoiding those we wouldn't). Zoltan has lived through many changes in Hungary's and Budapest's history and he isn't afraid to tell you the truth about what those experiences were (and still are) like, whether positive or negative.This is NOT a typical tour of the \"sights\" of the city, but rather an in-depth and extremely candid exploration and conversation. And make sure to request that Zoltan take you to a traditional Hungarian meal at a restaurant just outside the city. Zoltan is a perfect guide for small groups and those who are:- open and honest about the sorts of things they want (and don't want) to see and explore- curious enough to ask questions and interact with Zoltan- willing to sit and relax during the tour, have a coffee or beer- flexible in their itinerary; whatever Zoltan shows and tells you will be incredibleThis is not a tour for those: - looking to see as many \"sights\" as possible- on a tight and strict schedule- who don't want to interact with your guide and have a two-way conversationIn conclusion, Zoltan will answer any question you have, show you things you didn't know about, and open your mind to the realities (positive and negative) of historic and modern day Budapest and Hungary. I simply can't recommend him enough. I can only hope there is a \"Zoltan\" in the future places I visit."

While walking around the Castle District we were talking about the jews, the ottoman empire, we discussed todays Hungary compared to other countries, we talked politics and religion, we laughed and even had a beer! I am having a hard time describing this experience because it was so unique and really special. From all the tours we took this was the one that really showed us the meaning behind the city and its important, colourfull history. The best way to get to know Budapest is with Zoltan by your side. Do it! I am higly recomending it! You are gonna get the best guided tour ever!!!"

Zoltan is so knowledgeable and passionate about Jewish history and he didn't mind me persistently peppering him with questions. He showed our tiny group things that no one would ever get to see - for example, he knows the entrance codes to many residential buildings of people he's familiar with. As a result we were able to enter a private courtyard and see an original piece of ghetto wall. I'm writing this review a little late because my trip to Budapest was over a year ago, but this tour was unforgettable and I cannot recommend it highly enough."

Travelled to Budapest with the company and we booked a two hour walking tour with Rockhoppers to get to know the city a little bit. Had we known before we went how interesting and fun it would be, we would definitely have booked more time. Zoltan came and picked us up at the hotel, started by telling us a little bit about the history of Budapest and it\u2019s people. Then we went for our walk through the city and were told so many bits and pieces of both history and actualities you will not get anywhere else. He is such a nice man and you can really tell that he loves what he is doing. We had the best time, and he felt like a friend to us after just this short time. Think we all could have walked around, listened and talked with him all day!He also recommended a great Jewish restaurant for us to have lunch, Macesz Huscar, where we went after the tour was finished. So, do not miss the opportunity to book a guided tour with Zoltan when in Budapest. It definitely was the highlight of our trip!"

I think this partly explains why he gives great tours and why he is able to offer so much depth. He's also of the vintage necessary to provide perspective on the city's history and its present. The other part I think is that he truly enjoys walking the city and obviously gets pleasure from discovering new things, meeting new people and hearing new opinions and ideas.  I was in town on my own and am very happy that I took a chance and followed the good reviews to him."

I can honestly say that this was the most personalised tour I have ever been on; and what\u2019s more it was with an amazing man who was extremely knowledgeable across a wide range of subjects. Zolton catered the tour based on things we were interested in, which he ascertained via email prior to the tour. Zoltan was very informative about all the places we visited but throughout our journey he also gave us an in-depth conception of the history behind the landmarks around Budapest. Zoltan is a very respectful, humble friendly guy who will make every effort to ensure your tour is interesting and honest; and he provides a genuine insight to the current affairs of Hungary. I particularly thought it was very sweet that Zolton made the effort to get to know us on a personal level by taking an interest in what we do, where we came from etc and he also told us of his family and his life experiences as a teenager.I would highly recommend any tour with Zoltan especially if you are looking for a personalised tour which is great value for money, informative; honest and with a man of great sense of humour."

It was great to be in his company during this tour.As part of the ottoman tour we got exclusive access to see a Turkish bath from the 16th century that is currently being renovated and will reopen at some point in the future for the public when its complete. The architect Thomas is a complete genius! His work and the detail is truly spectacular, I will definitely like to come back to visit this bath when it opens. Not only did we learn about the Ottoman Empire in Hungary but Zoltan also covered a bit about roman Budapest and other aspects of Hungarian history which was really insightful. I would definitely recommend going on a tour with rockhoppers if you are visiting Budapest."

We booked his Jewish tour, and learned much about the history of the Jews in Budapest, but Zoltan also answered our many questions about the history of Hungary, the social and economic conditions both former and current. He's a wealth of knowledge and obviously enjoys this opportunity to inform visitors to add another layer to what the average tourist would see and learn in a few days.

The reviews on TripAdvisor were so outstanding that I decided to contact Zoltan to take the Art Nouveau tour. From the very start, Zoltan was extremely detailed in his e-mails with me, and wanted to learn more about me so that he could tailor the tour to my interests as much as possible. He's a highly educated man with a great sense of humor and love for the city of Budapest. If all you want in a guide is someone to lead you to the major tourist attractions and make corny jokes, then this tour is not for you. With Zoltan, I felt that I got a wonderful overview to the Art Nouveau of Budapest as well as lessons in history, philosophy, and politics. We explored out-of-the-way places where I'm sure most tourists never venture, and we even explored a tiny museum devoted to the history of the Budapest subway system. I was having so much fun, but I didn't want it to stop. My only disappointment is that I did not have time to arrange more tours with Zoltan while I was in Budapest. If you truly want to learn about the soul of the city, then this is the tour to take."

We also visited beautiful Danube embankment, where we could enjoy very picturesque and beautiful views and seeing unusual sculptures. All the sights we saw were accommanied by very interesting stories about the Budapest history, Hungarian mentality, traditions of the local people.

Now our feet hurt and we are going to pass out in bed. Great day. "

Zoltan, our private guide, made our celebration more special, hartful and one to remember. He is a very kind and knowledgable person and he told many stories about Hungary from different points of view while we were walking or driving or having lunch. He brought us to many hidden touristic places including nice restaurants and an excellent wine bar. Because of his guiding, we could touch and feel different parts of Hungary. His explanation and guiding really gave additional value to our visit. We saw many things we would not have been looking for ourselves in and around the city."

The owner of the pub, and the local Roma \"king\" - with a real crown on his head(!) made my colleagues dance and drink like crazy. They had a great time and as they told me they could completely switch off contract law in their heads :))). I really recommend Zoli and his network to enjoy your time in Budapest.

We were with my 12 y.o. daughter in Hungary some time ago, and I felt myself indebted to the rockhoppers for the way we were treated and taken care of. Zoltan guided us around the villages and beautiful small towns of Northern Hungary, and in Budapest. My daughter is lively girl who would appreciate too encyclopedic stories, while me being in Hungary for the first time wanted to listen about the history and culture and multinational layers of society as much as possible. Both of us were satisfied - my daughter said it was real adventure, and my excurse to the different realities of Hungary could not be better and fuller! I m still surprised how the same person could make it so interesting for both of us, and make such a great contact with a teenager. The food recommendations on the road were the best, 'ethnographic' and not much expensive. Zoltan's personal humanistic approach to different people living in Hungary contrasts with what I had seen in Eastern Europe, and the trip to gypsy village shows that. It is a bit shocking, but I would recommend it to everybody who comes to Hungary. Fascinating experience!"

I was taken around in the city and visited places where great events of the '56 uprising took place, and also sad places where people were tortured and had to suffer. A world with a Janus face, with a beautiful and also an ugly side. My guide Zoltan used to belong to the opposition then, and he can still use the skills he had to learn in those years. He did not judge everything of the Communist period, and did not praise everything that they are living in today. A fair presentation. The best somebody can have."

I had made contact with Zoltan 5-6 months before our arrival for our group of 16 travelers. Using emails and phone calls, we arranged a 2 day program for the group to see the famous tourist sights as well as the Real Budapest.... he promised. Zoltan met us at our hotel as soon as we had checked in at about 9:30am. It was earlier than expected, and I called him at his home. He was a lanky, scholarly looking gentleman with grayish hair and a beard; wearing a John Lennon cap. He spoke fluent English, soft spoken, but passionate about his country. Day one was a walking tour. He took us on foot and by subway to a few major sights: such as the Fisherman's Bastion, Hero Square...etc. We also went to see a couple baths, walked the Andrassy Ave. We specially enjoyed the coffee and pastry in a very special cafe (Book Cafe) that was hidden on the third floor of a large bookstore. It has the most amazing and ornate Baroque styled architecture. We finished the day in a very nice local restaurant \"Kaltenberg\", where some of us had the best Fried Pork Knee in Budapest. Day 2 was by bus for a tour of the countryside and 3 towns outside of the city. The little town of Szentendre was interesting, and we all enjoyed their local fried dough \"Langos\" ...yummy. The locals like it covered with raw garlic, but I passed. By the time we got back to the Danube Bend, it was foggy and damp, and we were all tired and ready for dinner. Zoltan had to rearrange our dinner plan on the fly. We didn't get back to our hotel until after 9pm. Zoltan was a knowledgeable guide. He knew the city and her history well, and he was easy to talk to and very accommodating. He looked after us for 2 whole days; from 9:30am to 9pm, and our group was very happy with his services. I would highly recommend him to our friends."

They give everyone the same tour over & over again. With Zoltan this was NOT the case. Over the course of the day, my dad, younger brother & myself went on an adventure hopping on trams, trains & then in his Land Rover to see, hear, touch & taste all of what Budapest is about.He shared with us intimate details of this incredible city, which we'd never find in a book and took us to places only the insiders know about. And I was amazed at how much we fit into the day. It would've took me a week to do all that we did in just a day's time, yet we never felt rushed.

The 1st day when we toured Buda & Pest we were with him until he walked us to a restaurant for dinner, around 7. He arranged it for us.

Touring Budapest with Zoltan is for those who wish to walk away with an in-depth understanding of various facets of life in Hungary, instead of being mere sight-seeing tourists ticking the city off of their \"Have Been There\" list. Zoltan is not your run-of-the-mill tour guide \u2013 previously a university professor who had traveled widely, including Mongolia and Tibet, as well as spending time in US. A visit to his website shows the heart he puts into making the experience an interesting and informative one even before the physical tour begins (though the website is being overhauled since we last visited it early in the year). We were lucky to have him guide us personally, as he mentioned adding staff to accommodate his growing business. He said he had tried being a guide for those readily available free tours and found it very uninspiring for a number of reasons but particularly the almost non-existent or superficial interactions. Thus, Zoltan would be the perfect choice if you are interested in engaging conversations, honest opinion of Hungarian politics and life in Hungary, enlightening info, interesting insights and tales on all that you see. We signed on with Zoltan for four tours in three days: Buda side, Pest side, Danube Bend, and the Gypsy Village. The city tours involved a lot of walking, with frequent stops as Zoltan pointed out not just the major attractions but little easily-missed details and told us not just the key facts but interesting tidbits as well. We did take mass transit as needed, and for farther destinations, both Zoltan and his lovely wife, Judy, took us in their two Land Rovers in order to transport all 11 of us \u2013 a larger than ideal group size for Zoltan that he nevertheless accommodated well. Zoltan\u2019s \u201cnegotiation skill\u201d kicked into high gears when we arrived at the Basilica in Esztergom just as it was closing - a result of the ladies in the group having too good a time shopping in Szentendre - and the guard refused to allow us in. Not wanting us to miss the magnificent red marble room nor the mausoleum below, Zoltan worked his magic and got us in to see both. We were fairly certain that a \u201cgreener\u201d tour guide like some of the others we had on the trip elsewhere would not have had the wherewithal to successfully negotiate our entry. A final testament of Zoltan\u2019s personalized service \u2013 I had indicated an interest in the music that accompanied the various tour details on his website, so he left a compilation CD for me at hotel concierge on the evening before our departure. It also included songs he played in his car during our drives,from jazz to gypsy music, to the hauntingly beautiful Bing Crosby 1930's rendition of \u201cBrother, Can You Spare A Dime\u201d. The CD is indicative of the level of thoughtful, attentive, and personalized service that many talk about but few can truly deliver. Having gotten to know Zoltan a little over the three days, I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way."

He told us so many amazing stories (and shared some fruit brandy!) and we couldn't haven't asked for a better introduction of the city. 5 stars doesn't even begin to do him justice. I don't have a single bad thing to say about the 5+ hours we spent with him."

We visited all the major sights listed on tripadvisor and Zolton explained the history of these sights making our 6 hour tour very interested and eager to learn more about this beautiful city.We were 3 x 27 year old men from Manchester who would have found the normal tours slightly boring as once you have seen one tour you have seen them all. Zolton contacted me before our tour and asked about us and wanted to know what we were interested so the tour good be tailored to our needs. This worked out fantastically as we couldnt have wished for more.At the end of the day Zolton took us to a beautiful restraunt that he recommended just outside of the city. This restraunt was fantastic and I would recommend any one who uses Zolton to definatly visit this tour.Zolton made our trip to Budapest and I would definatly recommend people to book with him.Quality"

We also visited a typical Hungarian market, a fantastic bookstore, and some really special coffee houses.

Since I only had three days to see Budapest, I scheduled a pretty aggressive schedule for Zoltan to accommate. I requested Zoltan to take us to Szentendre, Visegrad and Esztergom, towns outside of Budapest and then to visit Heroes Square, Buda Castle, Fisherman's Bastion, Sz\u00e9chenyi Bath, and many other major tourist spots within this two day period.Let me first start by saying the tour with Zoltan had made my trip to Hungary most memorable. My last rip to Budapest was 38 years ago. I was born in the U.S.A. and do speak Hungarian somewhat and my parents were both born in Hungary and I wanted to show my family where their grandparents came from. Now let me tell you why Zoltan is such a great tour guide. Zoltan provided an honest perspective of Hungarian history and gives you the good and bad in terms of it's history and politics, which I appreciated. During our tour, Zoltan pointed out historic sites and personalized the tour so much so that we felt we were traveling with a friend, not a paid tour guide. At one point in our trip to Szendre, he pulled off to the side of the road and couldn't understand why. We got out of the Range Rover and he said look up. We looked up to find a huge Stalk nest on top of an electrical pole with mom and the new baby stalks in the nest. This was very cool to see. As we bacame more familiar with each other, we ended up listening to gipsy music and believe it or not began singing to it as well. We ate lunch at some places that he recommended and all were very good. I even tried some Palinka (peach liquor), and the kids ate Langos,palachinta, and Heck fish at various spots. We had so much fun with Zoltan that we well exceeded our time with him on both days. The first day we ended our day with Zoltan at 8PM and the second day, although was suppose to be a half day ended up more like a full day. Zoltan never looked at his watch to say time is up as he gave us his undivided attention. When I asked my two teenage kids, what they thought of Hungary, they mentioned that Zoltan made the trip memorable. Zoltan made this trip great. The chemistry between us was perfect. I really feel like I gained a friend and will definitely seek him out again if I visit Hungary. I thought the cost for the two days was fair. He has far exceeded our expectations. As a small memento, he burned a CD of Hungarian music for me to bring back to my parents to listen to, which was very thoughful. Thank you Zoltan for a fun, honest, and personal tour of Budapest. We will not forget our time with you sightseeing Hungary."

In 5 hours, we explored the city (Castle Hill, Opera House, St. Stephen's Basilica, Matthias Church, Alexandra bookstore, etc...) while Zoltan enlightened us with the history and interesting stories of each place.

We walked through the city, saw everything we could squeeze in, and finished with a fantastic meal at a local restaurant just out of town. We had our 12 and 15 year old daughters with us and Zoltan was very considerate of their attention span. We all enjoyed the day despite the 95 degree heat."

Zoltan, of course, asked us before whether we were amenable to the addition and kindly cut down on the price. My sister and I are very used to walking tours, as we usually make a point of booking one for every city visited. This was probably the most we have ever paid for one. Not the best that we have every been on though, but probably not fair to compare one city to another or one guide to another. Zoltan showed us the local sights, the bad and the good. It was very sad to see the skeleton of an architecturally beautiful building being left to rot due to poor upkeep and private corporations. There's a lot of disappointment with the country's politics - but with the current climate, I don't think anybody could be full of praise for their politicians. My sister even commented that he seem to enjoy pointing out the bad things, which I guess says a bit. None the less, we walked around and saw a few things. Missed a few of the major ones like the basilica and the Danube, which was surprising. I guess he figured that everybody is already planning to go there, so maybe he focused the walk on less touristy areas. We had to remind him about lunch but I don't think 'lunch' was figured into the tour. He brought us to a cafe which served beautiful pastries though, which I enjoyed. He did recommend us a restaurant to go to after as well (I wanted to try the carp goulash), which I liked. Lots of the food recommendations are out of town which is not surprising, but a bit difficult for us to get to. I was a bit surprised that a whole day tour started at 10 and ended at 4 PM, especially for the price paid.Unfortunately, I did not get the whole 'unique and personal' tour that others had experienced. My overall impression was average. I have a feeling that we're probably younger than his normal clientele and he's maybe better off the beaten track and out of town areas. My recommendation if you only have a few days and is sticking to the centre of town is to get one of the free walking tours instead."

If you're up for some adventure and have an interest in the heart of the people as well as visiting the remarkable sights of Budapest, hang with Zoltan awhile. He can tailor your time in Budapest to whatever specific interests excite you most. For instance I love history and we spent time on trail of the ancient Roman past. My husband enjoys wine tasting and we visited little local Restaruants where tourists don't go. Spend time over a Hungarian meal, discussing the past, the present and the future. Zoltan is more than well-informed, personable, and fun (try a 4x4 ride in his Land Rover around the countryside). Spending time with and seeing a place through the eyes of someone who lives there, makes the experience unforgettable. Thanks Zoltan."

I chose Zoltan as my guide, because a) of his excellent reviews and b)I figured that anyone who used such sublime music on their web site ,had to be OK! On Day 1 Zoltan introduced me to Budapest, We travelled by trusty jeep, by tram, train and walked....so I learnt how to get around, was given an historical view of the city, was shown some delightful 'off the tourist track' places ..like an amazing coffee shop that you arrive at through a book store.I also learnt not to copy his greeting to people as it is all relational and a social minefield! After Day 1, I felt at ease wandering around the city for the next 2 days and soaking in the numerous spas and hamams(Also useful to have local suggestions). On Day 4 Zoltan took me out of the city to Danube Bend to get a wider view of the history, some small villages and to see the beautiful countryside. This was rounded off with a visit to a spectacular local restaurant. Zoltan is a natural storyteller, has a huge knowledge bank and really seems to enjoy his job.His tours deeply enriched my experience of Hungary."

He'll design the tour anyway you want, just give him your time frame and requests and he'll take it form there.The first day we spent in the city, first Pest - touring the Jewish Ghetto (where his \"open door\" policy is the best!), Sz\u00e9chenyi Baths and Park, Opera House, Heroes Square, Parliament, etc...Then onto Buda - hopping on the 16 bus to the Buda Castle, Fishermans Bastion, Faust Wine cellar, and so much more, all the while stopping at local restaurants (incredible lunch spot hidden in a book store that you'd never find on your own) and bakeries where everyone seems to know zoltan, and drinking Palinka along the way.The second day we hopped into his LandRover and went into the country. We first stopped at some ancient Roman Ruins along the way to Szentendre (great litte town of local artists where we knocked out a lot of gift shopping), Visegr\u00e1d (historic castle with amazing views), and Esztergom (one of the largest basiicas we've ever seen), and then to a small village of 300 people, who were bitter at Americans for something we did in 1956! We then stopped at Scheizl for an absolutley unforgettable meal, where our waiter was also the fisherman who caught our dinner!You can tell zoltan really cares about his country and takes pride in his tours.

What a difference that one guided day made on our impression of the city and the trip. He was great... knowledgeable and charming. He showed us the city from an insider's perspective and gave us insight to the history, culture, and people of a remarkable city. This day was the highlight of our trip."

I have a lots of friend around here, and quiet a few people was asking about me from Hungary. My best young friends just married in last year in February, and no money left for a good, very special honeymoon.... I didn't hesitate and I offered for them a nice, happy, but very interesting journey and I recommended Rockhoppers, especially Zoltan Nagy,..:o)) When they came back to Southland, they were more than happy: their relationship just got tighter than ever before,.... Zoltan is not only a very good presenter, he's like a good psychologist, when he'd seen a little wave between this young couple, he found very quickly a perfect solution of it!.... Chris and Rene just loved rockhoppers and Hungary!"

My boyfriend and I were headed to Budapest and wanted a tour that was relaxed and informative - this was just that. Zoltan was quick to respond to my email about a tour, and right away set up a meeting place and time. He came to our hotel and after a few minutes of informal \"get to know eachother\" conversation and going over what we wanted to accomplish and how much time, we headed out on foot. He was friendly and very knowledgable about Budapest and it's rich culture and history. We covered a lot of territory in 3 hours - by foot, subway and bus. Famous baths, monuments, elaborate coffee shops, the Castle, Museum locations, etc. Every stop had a story. I thought it was a great value for the cost. Seeing the city this way on the first day allowed us to have an understanding of how to get around Budapest and what we should focus our time on. It's a great way to see the city."

For us, we emailed asking for the same day as one other young lady- we three toured together with Zoltan as our guide. It was amazing!! He knows the history of the city, and has a story for a building on every block. We stopped several times for drinks and a break at our request, he even took us into a ruin pub for a palinka, and later had a glass of wine with us at Faust. I know that a normal group tour would not have been as accommodating, as open to our wishes, or as fun! There was a cheese festival in a square and we all went on for a look around. We popped in alleys and courtyards to see how real people live \"behind the scenes\". I was hesitant to hire a guide. When I emailed him I told him that I had planned to take the popular \"Free walking tours\". He assured me that he had worked for them before and would show us the same sights plus more. We are so glad we went with him. We werent rushed and left with a friend in Budapest. He is extremely knowledgeable, personable, and warm-hearted. He even offered to send us an info or links to information we may forget or want to explore further. I highly recommend a tour with Zoltan ! Any other info please ask."

I'm quite interested in different cultures that walk among us so the tour of the city's Jewish quarter seemed like a no-brainer.In all honesty, I was expecting to go to synagogues and hear the guide (Zoltan was his name) tell us about architecture and a few snippets of the culture, things that I'm already quite familiar with.I was wrong. Zoltan did an amazing job telling the group not just of the architectural periods but also the way the members of the Jewish quarter lived, how they managed to get on with other natives of Budapest, how they went through the second world war, etc. Not only that, but he had an interesting sense of humour so the tour was not at all dry.Overall, it was a fascinating tour and something off the beaten path, yet on the beaten path at the same time! Well worth the time. I definitely checking out the Rockhoppers tours."

The ruins were beautiful and educational, and the evening was excellent. The wine was great, the conversation was wonderful, and we had an unforgettable time. Be prepared to walk a bit outside for the Ruins tour; there are are four or five stops with the last one being a museum to the Roman town that used to occupy the site. After being outside with ruins, you will be wisked out of town to a small village, down skinny roads and a dirt road to an unassuming house above a beautiful grape orchard. There, you will be fed cheese, bread, and vegetables, introduced to the winemaker, and then wisked into the wine cellar. There, you will taste whites and reds from the region that will never see the inside of a commercial wine bottle. The wine tasted great, the experience was absolutely one of a kind, and I'll never forget the sunset over the vineyard. If your expecting a California-style wine tasting, with folks swishing wine around and spitting it out, you've come to the wrong place. Be prepared to leave really happy. Don't miss it."

I really couldnt have asked for a better experience.Do yourself a favor and book this, it will make hungary that much more alive."

He showed us many interesting things in the Jewish Quarter which we would not have known walking on our own. He was familiar with the area history and architecture. I wish he had been able to describe more of the Jewish faith and what some of their symbols represent-esp as this was specifically a Jewish Quarter tour. It was a disappointment that we didn't get to see the big synagogue or the shoe Memorial. The tour was a little slow paced and if I were to make a recommendation, I would encourage you to be very clear up front about what you want to see and will things be open. It was a disappointment that he left the big synagogue til last and it was closed. Other than that, it was a good tour."

We went on the Gypsy tour and guided by his expertise, entered a universe that is not readily understandable to the lay person. We wined and dined and danced our hearts full connecting a bit to the gypsy in us all. We went on the Jewish tour, and every cobblestone we stepped on took us deeper into Budapest's Jewish community...buildings and streets and shamashes in each synogogue...replete with history of the past and present. We went on a Danube Bend tour, starting with Memento Park to the south, the Citadel with Natasha standing tall as the statue of Liberty forever to be behold, and onwards to the startling beauty of Szentendre...a living picturesque monument of past communities with people carrying on with their lives today and the smallest synogogue ever...to Esztergom...the road approaching the city with the most monumental basilica to St Stephan ever...enough to convert even the most suspect of fellows with its size, grandeur, marble, and gold...we went across the bridge to Slovakia to dance to Klezmer music on the banks of the Slovakian Danube...Zoltan's curiosity and erudition to cultural humanity, his sensitivity to his guests make his tours an unforgettable experience. What can I say? Without Zoltan, our trip would have been a collection of monuments, buildings and dates. Zoltan is forever at our dinner table and I don't have enough words to express my thanks and appreciation of his talents."

We were planning a trip to Budapest.There were estatic reviews of the Rockhopper tours which convinced me to contact Zoltan.He picked us up at our hotel and drove us to a gypsy village. He introduced us to another world. Men and women dancing and drinking!! We,too,had drinks and goulash and danced. Our cameras didn't stop clicking.The next day Zoltan gave us the Jewish tour. We walked on cobblestones,went into old synagogues and were introduced to the Jewish communities which had made many contributions to the Hungarian society.The irony of it all. The Nazis herded 600,000 Jews and deported them to Auschwitz. Zoltan,an extremely educated and talented man,offered his observations of political and cultural events of Hungary. He opened up our minds and eyes.The 3rd tour, Zoltan took us to Castle Hill in Buda. it was twilight. We looked at the Danube and saw the lights of Pest and thought how lucky we were to have met ZoltanAnother peak into the Turkish community.Another wonderful tour day we went to Szentendre and Estergom and Slovakia!!!! We danced on the beach.Reluctantly we said goodbye and thanked Zoltan for being in our lives.Thalia"

Did you know that Jews settled down at the area, which is called today Budapest back in the 2nd and 3rd centuries? And their presence has been permanent at the area!Later they settled in the newly founded Buda town in the 13th century, as well, then in the Old Buda town, and finally in Pest. When they were already present all around, the three cities were united!They created a vivid life that started with a traditional religious way of life, and continued it all the way to the several Nobel Prizes for people born in Hungary.The Jewish Quarter is a great area now! Small and cozy restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s emanate the atmosphere of the old and the new life. Taste a kosher pastry called Flodni that contains poppy seeds, apples and walnuts! Try to get into Kazinczy Street 49, where there is an old fig tree in the yard. Take a look at a small, Sephardic synagogue in an apartment situated at the most dangerous district of the town. Try Bar Ladino! (Enlisted on Tripadvisor, too.) Jump in the Yeshiva of the Chabad Lubavich during a class, when bohers study with their rabbis and where pigeons fly into the class sometimes! Ask your guide to drive you in a cemetery where there are beautiful Art Nouveau crypts! Have a lunch at a kosher restaurant, where it is the steam of the kitchen that welcomes you still before you meet the waiter! Take a chance with the market of the district, built by the office of Eiffel, where the Roma sell their vegetables outside, and you can taste the fried meat inside that the locals eat!These guys organized it for us. Aren\u2019t you curious?"

No rosy stories, but rather the grit and grime of contemporary Eastern Europe. Especially the Roma parts are interesting and worthwhile - not because they are romantic (playful gypsies with flowers in their hair) but rather the real image of realities of life. On top of that, there is Zoltan, who's really fun and a great person, well informed and with access to places/people that no outsider would have, and who drives you around in really unexpected places... :) And he is also very hospitable - in the truly East European style - you know what I mean :)))"
