There are many festivals happening there which makes it even more exciting! Scrolling around at any time of the year is an experience in itself anyway! I don't want to say anything about.... Between Harajuku and yoyogi park (to be seen for both on a Sunday) don't miss it out (even if you are not a \"temple person\")"

            "review": "The Meiji Jingu Shrine. THE MEIJI JINGU SHRINEMeiji Jingu is a Shinto shrine in honour of the devine souls of former Emperor Meiji and his Empress Shoken. Emperor Meiji (1852 to 1912) the great great grandfather of Japan\u2019s present Emperor, had ascended the throne in 1867, and the Meiji Restoration had followed in 1868. After more than two centuries of isolation during the Edo era, Japan had opened up to the outside world through the initiative of Emperor Meiji. That had led to enormous cultural and social changes in Japan, and may have changed the course of its history. The shrine was set up in November 1920, and is almost a century old. It is a \u201cshrine for national peace and prosperity\u201d. Its serenity makes it a \u201cplace of calm\u201d in the heart of the bustling and vibrant city of Tokyo. Out of respect for Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken (who had passed away in 1914), the Japanese people had donated trees from all over Japan as well as from abroad, to set up a forest in which their souls could dwell in peace. That currently forms the Outer Garden of 74 acres. The gate of the Grand Shrine is made of a 1,500 year old Japanese Cypress, and is 12 ft high. The Inner Garden is of 173 acres, and is a natural forest that has graced that site for long. The main shrine is constructed entirely of wood, and has large thick pillars. It has a Japanese-style roof covered with green tiles. The interior is not open to the public and no photography is permitted. Japanese people who go to that shrine to offer their prayers, drop coins, clap their hands twice, bow twice, and clap their hands once again.There is a Treasure Museum on these grounds that displays the personnel effects of Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. Among these is a horse-drawn carriage they had used. The beautiful Iris Garden had been designed by the Emperor himself. There is also a large pond, well stocked with coloured carp fish. Visitors can drop them peanuts, and watch them rush to get their share. Floral plants like Azaleas, cherry blossoms and dandelions add to the serenity and beauty of Meiji Jingu.Hormuz P.

The south gate area was under repair, but there are still nice photo opportunities. I saw a wedding taking place. The wish tablets are very moving. I also was struck by the sakes and Burgundy wines along the pathway. Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a nice walk!"

Set in a tranquil park, it is a majestic and tasteful Shinto shrine dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Sh\u014dken (and quite different than the colorful Asakusa Temple also worth a visit). Very interesting to observe the cleansing and praying rituals, and pleasant walk through the park. Also very interesting, is the wall of French Wine barrels lining the entrance road (or exit for us since we entered north) to Shrine which were gifts to the Emperor from wineries in Bourgogne, France and is set right opposite from a wall of Sake barrels. From what I learnt, the emperor took the lead by promoting modernization, started wearing Western clothes, sheared his topknot and began eating Western food...and particularly enjoyed wine with his meals. Well worth it as part of our exploration of Shinjuku, walking from Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and its free observatory from which you can see Mount Fuji on a cloudless day (view from south tower is better), northwest of the park, and exiting south east of park into Harajuku area. Quite an interesting contrast going from such a serene temple and park to Harajuku hip youth and its fashion statements--fun to observe--and later on the local version of Times Square that is Shibuya crossing. As I found myself carrying unnecessary burden, keep in mind that there are no outdoor garbage cans in Tokyo as it is customary to take one's garbage home; you can find garbage can in subway restrooms. It it is also quite impolite to drink or eat on the street or on subway, and is not done."

The main complex is a good 10 minute walk from the station and is popular with bus loads of tour groups. You can buy votives and amulets as souvenirs, or a copper roof shingle (3000 yen) you write your name and a wish which will then be affixed to the roof which I thought was an interesting idea. We were lucky to see a Japanese bride and groom wjen we visited as it is a working shrine."

This shrine is the most visited in Japan, it has a steady stream of people coming and going the whole time and is definitely worth the time.It's near the fashion Harajuku area which is also definitely worth seeing, especially at night, grab a famous Harajuku crepe and walk down the street shopping and taking in all the colourful and amazing fashion.The walk to the shrine is a pretty one along a wooded pathway with towering trees overhead, it's a longer walk than I expected it to be and we felt sorry for the couple of tourists with suitcases who obviously thought they'd make a quick stop.When you get to the shrine you will see the gifts (hundreds and hundreds of dolls and stuffed toys) placed there along with a tree with wooden plaques where you can write your wishes down and have the priest pray for them/ you each morning once pinned upon the tree.I enjoyed looking around this shrine, but if it's a peaceful, restful place you're looking to come to, to pray than personally this wouldn't be my choice."

It is usually thronged with tourist groups, though that speaks to how revered and visited it is. I recommend that you get there the earlier the better. There are alot of trees, so there should be shade on a sunny day day. It has a wide open plaza at its center, great for taking in the whole of the structure. When my wife and I visited, we were very fortunate to observe a Shinto wedding. Also, feel free to purchase a tablet to hang on a sacred tree dedicated to Emperor Meiji and his wife. There are very interesting reading from travelers all over the world."

In a separate review, I awarded the Yoyogi Park five stars.

            "review": "Shrine of \"significance\" though not \"too grand\" :). Being the shrine honoring Emperor Meiji & his wife, it should not be missed while in Tokyo, but don't expect to see a grand shrine (like Nikko's Toshogu Shrine) as it is a pretty ordinary shrine though yes the main shrine building is a \"fairly big\" one.I got there from the north side entrance which is on the north side of Yoyogi Park - went through the torii gate there, followed by a 5-to-10-minute walk to the grounds of the Shrine which is kind of like a courtyard with the main shrine building on one side and corridors on the other sides (with bonsai tree displays in some and like long benches for people to sit & relax in some). And there are some other smaller buildings & structures too right outside the main shrine grounds area; but it was past 5 pm when I got there, so those surrounding ones were pretty much all closed, and I was just thankful the main shrine was still open! For leaving the Shrine, I want to suggest leaving from the south side where you'll go through the 'Grand Shrine Gate' which is the \"largest\" wooden torii gate of that particular style in the whole country (as the sign nearby says) and where you'll also see displays of sake & wine barrels on shelves (with an info sign nearby that says Emperor Meiji started to drink wine from the West to show his people that the western food can be included in the Japanese diet). There's also a gift shop on the south side, not too far from the main shrine grounds; most importantly, right beside the south-side gate (upon exiting through the torii gate there) is Harajuku Station (a small station with just JR Yamanote Line but you can take a short train ride from there directly to Shibuya Station where you can connect to a lot more lines).Also, Shinjuku Gyoen (a pretty decent park with a beautiful French Garden) is just about a 10-min walk away from the north entrance of this shrine (the entrance I came in on the north side of Yoyogi Park as mentioned above; I got here after leaving Shinjuku Gyoen from its south gate called Sendagaya Gate; the south side of Shinjuku Gyoen and the north side of Yoyogi Park are in a fairly close proximity to one another)."

When I first stepped into the wooded path towards the main shirne, it was like stepping into a different world. Tons of green, birds chirpping, and absolutely no noise from traffic, trains and shoppers who are eager to drop some money on some Harajuku goodies. It was a very nice walk and a change of pace. The shirne itself was amazing. Very open and a good mixure of regulars and tourists. Will definitely go again."

There are two building near the Main Hall which named Treasure Museum and Anex, but again it is not free to enter ... but if you are fancy of Japanese culture 500 yen is nothing."

During the weekend you will find many elderly Japanese and their family coming in troves due to perhaps the historical and also cultural significance of this place. We were pleasantly surprised by two traditional weddings conducted within the vicinity of this shrine. The married couples together with their families were wearing the traditional Japanese Kimonos and forming a train of procession led by a Shinto Priest who presided the occasion .I would recommend the end of March and beginning of April for those who fancy the magnificent blooming season of the Cherry blossom .Apart from the classical and traditional Japanese buildings one can also enjoy and appreciate the architectures and artistry of diverse poles, structures and buildings which make up the shrine. Some areas of the shrines are out of public as they are still functioning religious and cultural Centres to the local Japanese. Not far from this shrine is the Imperial East Garden or Kokyo Higashi Gyoen. It is another beautifully maintained garden with small lakes and bridges. An ideal place for photo taking especially with the splendid Cherry blossom in full bloom!."

Be prepared also there is some renovation work going on now as a preparation for the 100th anniversary celebration in 2020. My experience is just wonderful , it's just large Forrest are within this city , the ground are so spacious and has many walking path and it's just nice to walk while enjoying the scenery . The main complex is about 10 -15 minutes walk from the entrance . When you enter this shrine there is this huge gate which is called \" torri gate\". What's astonishing is that, I think maybe thousands of trees that make up shrine and that is remarkable . You will love it as for me it just gives a lot of peace and calmness in my mine . This is one of the most popular shrine in Japan so if you have the opportunity please do visit ."

Once there don't miss the temizuya (\u624b\u6c34\u820e), a water-filled basin for symbolic purification of the soul. Simply use the ladle to rinse your left hand, your right, then pour water into your hand for rinsing your mouth. After you're done, let the remaining water run down the ladle's handle and that's it! You've washed your hands, your mouth, the ladle and you're ready to approach the main shrine.When standing before the shrine, whipping out your camera is only going to invite dirty stares from the locals. Instead, why not throw a coin or two into the offertory box and make a wish Japanese style? Just bow twice, clap your hands twice, then make your wish and finally, bow one last time.If you're visiting in the summer do bring along mosquito repellent! Alternatively you can ask for some at the entrances."

It is a popular place for traditional weddings, and on the weekend you are often going to be treated to wedding processions that again harken back to the grand days of the old empire. Every visitor to Tokyo should go to the Meiji Jingu Shrine."

It's located just beside the JR Yamanote Line Harajuku Station, Meiji Shrine and the adjacent Yoyogi Park make up a large forested area within the densely built-up city. The spacious shrine grounds offer walking paths that are great for a relaxing stroll.The wooden torii gates at the entrance to the shrine are 40 feet high. It's hugely impressive!!Tips while visit: At the torii (shrine archway):1) Bow once when entering.2) Bow once when leaving.At Temizuya (font):1) Rinse your left hand.2) Rinse your right hand.3) Pour water into your left hand.4) Rinse your mouth.5) Rinse your left hand again.6) Rinse the dipper (allow the remaining water to run down the handle of the dipper).Please do not touch the dipper directly with your lips, and please do not throw coins into the water.At the main shrine buildings:1) You may put some coins into the offertory box.2) Bow twice.3) Clap your hands twice.4) You may make a wish if you like.5) Bow once again.Please do not take photos or videos close to the main shrine buildings."

The wooden gates (Torri) at the entrance are hugely impressive in scale and are a teaser for what lies within.Be sure to watch and follow the 'purification' ritual before entering the main shrine - fascinating experience.

Catch the golden hour and you'll get some amazing photos.My family combined a visit here with a family photo shoot at a nearby studio.

The original shrine was built in 1915, but was destroyed in World War II. The shrine was rebuilt in the 1950's.As we entered the shrine there is a huge torii (Japanese shrine gate). Inside, there is a large courtyard sanctuary signifying where Emperor Meiji eats in the after life.There is also an area where you can Purchase a wish/prayer to the god Meiji.Learning about the Japanese Shinto Shrine culture is fascinating and it made our visit very memorable. This is definitely a place where you should visit when you are in Tokyo area."

Meiji Jingu or Meiji Shrine is one of the few landmarks I visited in Tokyo.Meiji Shrine is located in the middle of a forest so there was a bit of walking to do before reaching the shrine itself. The entrance was really close from the Shibuya subway station and you would have to cross a white marble bridge that shows a divide between entrance/park and the streets of Shibuya.I would also recommend wearing sneakers or runners because the ground is very uneven and very rocky/sandy on the path to Meiji Jingu!Being greeted by the huge torii gates at the entrance of Meiji Jingu, I would say that the path to Meiji Jingu itself would be 10-15 minute walk (straight walking, without stopping to take photos, etc.)You\u2019ll pass by these wall of sake barrels on the way to the shrine.These sake barrels are offered every year to the enshrined deities by the members of the Meiji Jingu Nationwide Sake Barrel Association, including the Kotokai, which has made offerings of sake for generations as well as other sake brewers around Japan, wishing to show their deep respect for the souls of Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. All these sake barrels were donated by sake brewers, in hopes for the continuous prosperity of the sake brewing industry and all the other industries maintaining Japan\u2019s traditional culture.The above excerpt was from the information plaque beside the sake barrels titled as \u201cBarrels of Sake Wrapped in Straw\u201d right beside this beautiful sight :) .Finally reached Meiji Jingu!The entrance was slightly covered because they were doing construction, but after walking by that, here is the view of Meiji Jingu:)Meiji Jingu was quite surreal\u2026Its clear white tiles, big green trees, the temple, and the wishing tablet area. It\u2019s quite peaceful being in that area. It\u2019s temple grounds are quite big and the temple itself, where you get to pray (is photography prohibited) is peaceful as well.These Ema (wooden wishing tablets) come at a price at \u00a5400 or \u00a5500, which you can purchase from a Miko (shrine maiden in Japanese). There are different patterns of Ema(s) which were all beautiful.There was also a cheaper option of prayer which was nearby the prayer wall. They offer papers, pens and an envelopes for you to write your prayers/wishes. They ask for a donation, and you just drop it off at a drop box nearby. There was also a paper that teaches you how to get a successful prayer \u2013 such as, not wishing for greed like wishing for money, or wishing for unrealistic stuff.I was also lucky to witness a Japanese wedding!!People were rushing up to take photos but there was security guards around to create the barrier for the ceremony.Meiji Jingu is one of the more popular shrines in Tokyo, and it was definitely a sight to see. I was definitely happy to be able to witness a Japanese wedding as people have mentioned that you must be lucky to do so."

First visit, I was fortunate enough to visit in June when all the irises were blooming in the empress' garden. It was absolutely stunning. Different types of irises everywhere, different Violet's and purples. I felt very fortunate to see such beautiful flowers and blooms in the garden.This time it was in the dead heat of summer and the walk through the Meiji Shrine provided some needed shade and peace after braving some of the crowds in other popular tourist sites. Walking up to the shrine is wonderful. I think our guide said there were 100,000 trees around the shrine. Some have grown to spectacular heights and provide heavy shade from the burning sun. It's a 15-20 minute walk to the shrine. You enter into the shrine through large gates. The shrine itself is quite spacious with a big courtyard in front of it. I was lucky the first time I visited to see a wedding procession. We made wishes in the offertory and also in front of the shrine around a big tree (wooden tablets but also can make wishes on paper and put in an envelope).The Meiji Shrine is a place I could see myself coming back to often while visiting Tokyo and seeing it throughout the seasons. It is a peaceful place to stroll around in, a perfect weekend afternoon. It is also conveniently located next to one of the best shopping areas in Tokyo as well as the fun Harajuku shopping district."

Once through the torii, you were met by silence. The huge trees effectively isolates the shrine and grants a peaceful retreat from the bustling city. Walking on the paths, you really did not hear anything other than gravel crunching underneath your feet, not even the usual din and bustle of the city. The Omamoris (charms) sold here were on the pricier side - about 800 yen each - but they were of good quality and I'm sure bring good luck. There is also a well-stocked and fairly priced souvenir shop on the shrine grounds that's worth checking out."

It's right off a main drag of the fashion district, which is very fun to walk through. Then go to the main entrance of the shrine, and take the wide avenue that leads to the shrine under mature trees that arch over the gravel path. It is usually crowded, particularly on the weekends, but somehow it all seems worth it. There are a couple of museums in the park that show lovely Meiji-era artifacts and artwork that is absolutely worth seeing. Otherwise, there is no food and drink allowed outside restaurants, and it's not a touristy shopping explosion outside the shrine like others. The shrine is a multi-courtyard complex, with simple darke wood, white plaster and relatively natural design that is quite stunning. If you are not there for a ceremony, like a wedding, you will not be allowed to enter most of the shrine proper. But you will get peeks and glances, and I found it quite satisfying. I was there on a Saturday, and there were 3 wedding processions in the hour or so I was there...very moving, with the traditional dress, etc. Take your time, and write a prayer on a small piece of wood for 500 yen, and priests will collect them and say your prayers. Then, wander around in the park through a variety of secluded paths. There isn't much signage in English, so either read up before you go, or just enjoy the landscape without worrying about the significance. Either can be enjoyable."

The gardens (500\u00a5) are pretty but summer is probably not the time to see them at their best. Mosquitoes everywhere so wear as much clothing as you can! We were here by 9am & walked to the shrine when it was very quiet. We did the gardens in the afternoon by which time the shrine complex was very busy, however the gardens weren't. English signage confusing as the entrance to the gardens is labeled as the entrance to a well - they're one and the same."

The shrine, and Yoyogi park, cannot be accessed from the Yoyogi Koen (park) subway stop. Having done it, trust me, you do not want to walk from there to Harajuku, the correct stop for the entrance. The shrine has a separate entrance from the park, but it was pretty well labeled and we found it. The walk to the shrine is a gravel road, mostly in the shade. It was very crowded. Halfway, it looks like there's a small shop, bathrooms, and maybe cafe. Our entire shrine visit was maybe 10 minutes (perhaps we missed something?). For the walk back, we took the back path, through the woods, and it was pleasant and shady."

A walk around the grounds is a must as an insight into old imperial times and offers a number of serene spots to sit and contemplate. Interesting history. There are often weddings there and we were fortunate enough to be there to see one and the obliging bridal party didn't mind photos being taken. The gates are really impressive.

I was originally going to go alone but then a friend decided to tag along which was nice as the walk to the Meiji Shrine was quite long from the Harajuku station. We only had two hours to spare after work that day before the park closes, so we brisk-walked to the Meiji Shrine. It was a gloomy, cloudy day with off and on light rains, but the trees provided much-needed cover for us. It wasn't the best weather to visit the shrine as it made everything quite grey, but we had no other time to go so tried to make the best of what we had. The entrance to the park was being renovated for the 2020 Olympics so it was a bit unsightly for photos with the bright orange cones, but the fact is that the Japanese work in the tidiest of conditions, given the nature of construction work, and the place was kept really neat and tidy and some people would not even realise there was construction going on. It was a good 15-20 minute walk from the main gate to the shrine. There were signs showing the way so it was easy to navigate. Upon nearing the shrine, you see the sake barrels alongside the paths, which were really intriguing. There was even a sign giving information about the barrels and the history and significance of them.Entering the shrine, you will see more construction work being done but again, it was kept in such a tidy and neat state. The scaffolding was covered with a canvas that had a life-sized image of the shrine, so it was a good way to give you a sense of how it would have looked like should it not have been covered up. Not unsightly at all and was left really impressed with the way the Japanese work. Inside the shrine, you have a large open space with two large trees in the foreground, providing a really pretty \"frame\" for the place. The trees were so round, almost too perfect-looking! Surrounding one of them is a structure where you can hang your \"ema\" on - a wooden tablet where you write your wishes which can be purchased at the shrine. To the right is another area where you can buy some souvenir charms and get your fortunes told. There was also a restaurant. The shrine was really quite gorgeous. I loved looking at the architecture and how the wooden structures perfectly blended into the natural surroundings of the shrine. It was a very spiritual, peaceful place. Try to go when the weather is good!"

We don't usually apprecitate trees, but this kind of nature is truly awe inspiring. Getting to the temple and moving around requires a nice walk. We went on a really warm and humid day. We had to buy water bottles to stand the heat and moisture (July 2016).The atmosphere in the temple/shrine is inspiring if you are the kind of person that seeks insightful moments. If you don't appreciate silence, diversity and sacred places, then don't bother, you will just spoil the mood for others. It was nice to see respectful tourists, not abusing of taking selfies and stuff like that. Most, if not all, tourists respected the rules and took pictures only in open areas."

The walk from the train station to the main entrance is short, right around the corner from the train station... however, it's a long walk to the main shrine complex. It's not a temple, it's a shrine to the Meiji Emperor, who is not buried there. Very green with lots of big trees lining the main walkways. The arches are impressive. It's a nice stroll but lacks some of the true temple feel of the Kyoto temples. The JR station for Meiji Jingu is itself an architecture legacy from a different era, worth seeing too. We had lunch at the on-site eatery, pretty good but a big pricy for the portions... but good AC space to rest after the long walk."

Nestled in the busy Shibuya area, It's a massive park that is surprisingly quiet and serene. I found myself doing much introspection as I a strolled through and appreciated its peaceful visage. Signs will point you in the direction of the main shrine, here you can pay your respects to the departed Emperor and Empress. Please note that no pictures are allowed in this area and instructions on how to pay your respects are illustrated (personally, I just mirrored what those next to me were doing). Before entering the torii gate to the main shrine, it is customary to cleanse your hands and mouth before entering the main area. You'll see the fountain to your left before entering. It also customary to bow on entering and leaving through each torii, but no one will make a fuss if you refuse to do so. I really enjoyed my morning there and I will certainly visit again.Happy Travels"

I wished we could have gone into the shrine and seen everything up close. Nonetheless, the entire experience left me feeling blessed and peaceful."

Tucked away in a well manicured, deeply shady park (offering a much needed break from summer heat!), the shrine is a once a solemn place and welcoming of foreigners. Signs explain a ritual involving purification with water, bowing, clapping, and depositing of coins. Various charms are available for the equivalent of just a few USD (between about 300 and 800 yen), and make lovely gifts."

Located just a few minutes walk from Harajuku Station, the Meiji Jingu Shrine is a peaceful and serene area right in the middle of the city.As opposed to practically everywhere else we went, there was plenty of space here to move around and explore the grounds. The forest area is large and expansive and very well maintained. It was very calming to just walk around and take in Mother Nature for a little bit. The actual Shrine its self, while not nearly as ornate as all the Thai temples I have visited, was still beautiful and quite striking! We would just observe what the locals were doing as far as rituals and customs and the like. It was fascinating taking it all in!The park is free to wander about, however they do have an \"Inner Garden\" available to see for 500 Yen ($4.14 USD), as well as the Meiji Jingu Treasure House, also for 500 Yen. Don't forget to check out the wall of sake barrels and wine barrels along the pathway as well.Another tidbit I have to throw in is the public restrooms here were freaking spotless! This part alone impressed the hell out of me! lolThis is an easy to find Shrine and worthy of a spot on your Tokyo itinerary, especially if staying in the Shinjuku or Shibuya area!"

It is located between Shinjuku and Shibuya adjacent to Harajuku in the middle of Yoyogi Park. The whole setup is very tranquil especially after busy Shinjuku, where we were staying. While I did not find it impressive architecturally, it has great calming feeling while you walk through the park passing by two stacks of barrels, one with sake and another with Boudreaux wine and then entering the shrine itself. It feels like you are out of town in countryside. As it was the first Shinto shrine we saw, it is difficult to compare to older and more magnificent shrines in Kyoto and Miyajima, but it is definitely worth going. Unfortunately we got there in the late afternoon and the Inner Garden was already closing so we could not visit it."

The huge tori gate which welcomes you at the entrance is impressive and the walk towards the temple is beautiful. We visited on a Sunday which meant we managed to capture a few wedding processions and few other religious activities going on throughout our visit. We went there around 8.30 in the morning and it was relatively busy but by the time we left around noon, it was very busy as with most tourist spots. Many reviewers has pointed out that there are more impressive temples / shrines around Japan, but I think if you're only visiting Tokyo and have a spare Sunday, Meiji Jingu is a must visit for me. It is also the temple with the most activities going around compared to all the other we've visited in Tokyo, Kyoto & Osaka."

This is posted, but many people ignore the signs. This was the only drawback of the experience- people not respecting the signs and just taking pictures of whatever they wanted. We felt most privileged to be able to experience the shrine and enjoyed a nice walk through the forest after. It was a great escape from the city, and had an energy of its own. You can see the giant sake bottles out front as well which is worth the visit in itself."

We were there early, so we didn't encounter too many people, just us and a few others. We walked up to the area where you wash your hands and mouth before entering, per tradition -- we tried to participate in these whenever possible and appropriate -- and after doing so we entered the shrine. It was quite beautiful in its simplicity, and it was great to see all the traditional ceremonies in motion (a wedding was happening, Shinto priests were about doing their work).

One permanent, unchanging refuge in the center of this busy -- and sometimes overwhelming metropolis -- is the beautiful Meiji Shrine. It is an oasis of calm, quiet, greenery in the great city. A visit to Meiji Shrine will refresh and restore any exhausted traveler!Dedicated to the Emperor Meiji, the Japanese ruler who presided over the modernization and Westernization of his country. Emperor Meiji ruled from 1867 to 1912, and that period witnessed the transformation of Japan from a somnolent agricultural society to a powerful industrial empire in the late-19th and early-20th century. The shrine is particularly crowded on major national holidays, and especially on New Years Day, when millions of Tokyo citizens and visitors flock there as their first shrine pilgrimage of a new year.The Meiji Shrine occupies several hundreds of acres -- much of the space left as natural, barely tended forest. It is full of birds and small wild animals, serving as much as a refuge for them as for Tokyo's human inhabitants. The main avenues approaching the shrine are broad and graveled, easily accommodating the throngs that visit the shrine on holidays or on Sundays. On weekdays, these walkways are quiet and sparsely populated. Step off the main avenues, and one finds oneself on narrow paths through the forest, feeling as distant from the surrounding city life as if one were hiking through the mountains. It feels quite amazing to be so isolated and private while only a few minutes away from one of the largest, busiest cities in the world!Often one encounters weddings or Shinto ceremonies (such as \"hatsumode,\" when a family brings a newborn child for his or her first visit to the Shinto deities) at the Meiji Shrine, and the ceremonials are a faint reminder of modern Japan's connection with its ancient agricultural and animistic origins. The Meiji Shrine was a favorite refuge for the Empress Shoken, consort of the Meiji Emperor, who frequently visited the pavilions surrounded by beautiful gardens. Her gardens have been preserved much as they were in the late-19th century. A spectacular moment to visit the shrine gardens each year is in early June, when the famous iris gardens are in full bloom. Thousands of iris plants (largely of the \"shobu\" and \"ayame\" types, generally called \"Siberian Iris\" in the U.S. and Europe), are displayed in gorgeous rivers of purple and blue and white. It is a spectacular sight, especially beautiful in the gentle rain of the Japanese rainy season, and should be a highlight of any June visit to Tokyo!"

The shrine itself is beautifully serene despite the number of tourists.  Make sure to get your fortune at one of the kiosks. If it's bad you leave it tied by the kiosk, if it's good you take it with you. It's also possible to make wishes by writing them on wooden tablets which you hang by the beautiful trees flanking the temple. It's an experience visiting this shrine. I loved it.

I knew it was a big deal, and knew it was close to Harajuku, but that's about it. I approached the shrine from the North Entrance because my JR Pass expired, so I used a Tokyo Metro line (which was great because I passed a 7-11 on the way and got to pick up some goodies) and walked south until I saw heavy trees; then I followed the crowds until I approached an enormous torii gate and knew I was in the right place!I easily spent 2 and a half hours here; it was an absolutely gorgeous and refreshing walk to the temple, because the path is covered with a tree canopy and a lovely path. I could walk up and down that path all day and be completely content. The temple path juts off to the side once you hit the intersection, so keep an eye on your orientation; you could easily accidentally leave the temple woods without seeing the Shrine!Somewhat opposite to the temple path is a beautiful wall of sake barrels, and behind the wall is an AMAZING gift shop; I bought some handbags and fans for my family and they absolutely loved it.Anyways, continue onto the temple entrance and you'll be greeted with a BREATHTAKING view of....scaffolding for a restoration project! Haha. I was there in May and the main entrance was covered in scaffolding for restoration, but please enjoy it anyways! Most historical locations are not restored often, so you're actually witnessing a historical event. That aside, the actual shrine itself is gorgeous, with one of the most beautiful prayer trees I have ever seen. It's definitely worth the time to see and enjoy!"

The main buildings, first built in 1920 and built again in 1958, appear brand new or well maintained. The majestic shrine venerates the Meiji emperor and his wife who symbolize the country's abrupt change from traditional culture to a new industrialized and fully-armed country, erasing the samurai class and leaning away from Buddhism toward Shinto which was declared the state religion. Though the grounds and buildings symbolize the new Japan, entering through the torii gate and experiencing them seemed like a return to a more peaceful and graceful past with traditional Shinto shrine architecture and open, lovely grounds."

It about a 15 min walk from the Shinjuku Washington Hotel and very easy to find. Once I got there, the walk was so tranquil and green. I recommend bringing a blanket and a book to read on the lawn - it was so lovely and relaxing, the perfect way to start off my day of exploring the city. Overall a gorgeous spot with a fascinating history. Highly recommend."

People are nicely quiet (cell phones get put away and folks pay attention to their surroundings) and you can enjoy contemplative thoughts. When you come upon the shrine area, you will find the traditional washing basin, prayer envelopes, and people offering money with their prayers in front of the proper locations. Maybe we came upon the Meiji Shrine on a quiet day, but it seemed much less touristy than most popular shrines in Japan. This was an enjoyable place to visit."

The architecture is really amazing and its worth a visit. Be mindful as guards will tell off tourists who sit on temple steps or are otherwise disrespectful."

You may also buy wooden plates to write your intentions or well, if I may say so, wishes on the board and to hang them on pegs near a tree. If you do not wish to spend Y500 on the wooden board, paper with special envelopes are available free of charge but you are encouraged to give a little at the shrine itself.The road leading up to the shrine would remind you of the old Japan, when there were no cars yet. Try to imagine \"Samurai X\" or \"Last Samurai\" as you walk towards a shrine or on your way to another town through a forest full of trees."

The shrine can be accessed either by JR Yamanote line (Harajuku station) or Tokyo Metro Chiyoda line (Meijijingu-mae station). A less than 5 mins walk leads to a massive and impressive Torii gate at the entrance. There is no entrance fees and it's not allowed to eat or drink inside the shrine area.The approximate 10 mins walk to the main shrine is lined by tall trees on either side. You are transported to a world very much different than the hustle and bustle of the mega city that surrounds it and the whole experience is mesmerizing.The structure and architecture of the main shrine is very impressive. A routine of clapping and bowing is required to be followed for offering your respect. Before the side exit there is a place where you can write a wish if you want , place it in an envelope and put in designated boxes (there is an advice on the envelope to offer some money as you desire). As our hotel was in Shinjuku, we walked back through a trail to the left of the side exit. To walk along the tree lined path with calmness all around and listening to the chirping of birds was so refreshing and uplifting.Would strongly recommend this experience."

Tokyo is alive and well with stunning architecture, fine dining, courtier shopping, common everyday Ramen and Gyoza shops and 32 million people in or in close proximity to the city. It buzzes and it can be crowded, so that is when you should go to Meiji Jingu to relax and soak in the real world of Japan past and future. The pathways are wide and immaculate. The trees, shrubs and seasonal flowers show their well tended selves as you contemplate nature and the peaceful surroundings and you find yourself whispering or not talking at all. It DEMANDS your silence and that of others. For over 50 years I have trod these paths while living there or visiting. The last time was three weeks ago when we ended our Asian cruise on the ms Volendam in Yokohama/Tokyo and stayed in Shinjuku at the Keio Plaza. When you get to the actual Shinto Shrine area, taking a sip of the cold pure water in a wooden ladle and watch the Priests scurry around in their starched white robes moving like unearthly beings throughout the complex, you remain silent. Though this time was at the end of the Cherry Blossom season there were still some trees that regaled us with their pink delicate patina; but my absolute FAVORITE time to visit Meiji Jingu in its park like setting is in winter on the day of the first snowfall. It is magnificent and silent and mystical. I sadly will probably not experience that again as at 73 I prefer the warmth of our home and usually travel when the weather is more hospitable.And then reality hits you as you exit the park at Harajuku station and you are in the midst of young and middle aged shoppers, posers, and lookers. Though unlike Hong Kong where the cacophony of sounds is what you witness, this is just thousands of trendy people sometimes 6 abreast walking by the expensive and not so expensive shops or stopping to eat at the $$$$$ restaurants nestled next to an $ local ramen shop! It is a glorious way to spend a day! I assure you!"

Saw some parents with their kids, in kimonos walking to & from the shrine. If you ask them, if you can take a picture, then most of the time they'll allow it. But please ask. Just the polite thing to do.On the west side of the park there's a gift shop, places to eat, and places to relieve yourself. The prices at the store were reasonable & the food cost varied, depending on where you were going to eat. The food is good & the staff are very friendly.If you like walking in a park and it's a pretty amazing park & see a shrine & some history, then please come here. You'll enjoy it."

The Mieji Temple is about 10 to 15 minute's walk from central Shibuya located within a mini forest in the middle of the built up city area. There's the main temple itself as well as a few other interesting buildings as well as the nice walk through the trees. There's no cost so I definitely recommend visiting here if you have 1 or 2 hours to spare!"

Then when you start walking, you start to feel calm because even though there were a lot of people, it was quiet and relaxing. We saw some graduates wearing kimonos and someone who proposed to their girlfriend there. About a third of the way there, you will see the Sake (rice wine) wall (more pictures there). The Shrine was huge when you get inside, there was a prayer box and small souvenir shop inside. I would say the highlight of the Shrine was the walk to the Shrine. Walking through the forest was relaxing and rejuvenating. It does require a lot of walking, but we really didn't feel exhausted after the walk."

Was that wine and sake still drinkable? Had anyone ever tried to drill a hole in one of those barrels and drink it's contents? Hmmm. I dont think a barrel of wine would last five minutes in a park in Australia but that's the beauty of Japan. No one steals anything. I would recommend looking at the Meiji Shrine website before going as it describes the etiquette for your visit. I didnt look at it until later so hopefully i didnt offend anyone.

This is a late review as I visited in July 2015.My wife and I walked through Harajuku and we decided to split up as she wanted to look at architecture and I wanted to check out the local color. I found the entrance to the temple and made the half mile (maybe more) walk into the main temple courtyard. The temple was beautiful and I took quite a few pictures. However I noticed some well dressed Japanese persons walking in and out of a side building. I waited for a few minutes and was rewarded with a Shinto wedding procession moving its way into the main temple. It was very elaborate and made the visit more interesting."

The most disappointing part is there is lack of english signs and board explaining what we are seeing. There are part of the trail where you see many lantern, there's part where you see huge Japanese gate, some trails have branches; but I do not understand any single thing they have there.

Be sure to check out the most beautiful lanterns (toro) that line the path as well as the donated Sake barrels that tower at the entrance. As this is a Shinto Shrine be sure to wash your hands and mouth with the baci (cleaning basin), first using your right hand to hold the ladle and clean your left hand before swapping to clean your right hand cupping some water to clean your face and then running water down the ladle.

One interesting and low cost item is a poem that is revealed to you by chance. You shake a box to reveal a stick with a number. Give the number to a shrine maiden, and for 100 yen, you receive a poem written either by Emperor Meiji or Empress Shoken. The hope is that you will find some meaning in your life with the poem.

It was stunning to see it all. The temple itself is beautiful and you can throw coins into a specific area for good luck as well as purchase and burn different varieties of incense.

The forest surrounding the shrine is a 150 year project (it's is currently about 90 years old,) blots out the sun and the surrounding cityscape to create a sensation of being transported into a sanctuary hidden away from the modern world. Japanese people have a long held belief that deities descend to Earth via the tall trees and that their spirits dwell in them. Meiji Jingu should not be rushed.

We wanted to ride our bikes but nobody else was so we guessed that it might not have been allowed. The park was busy but there was enough space to move about and not get lost in crowds. Lots of people enjoying winter sunshine today. The treasure museum was closed but everywhere else was still accessible. A must see spot if you are into going to parks. Always kept really tidy."

It is located in Harajuku in the Yoyogi Park, and it's HUGE! Wear comfortable shoes because you are literally walking through some amazing nature before entering the shrine. Also, dress appropriately, you don't want to be rude to the Japanese culture by wearing indecent clothing. Remember to check the opening and closing times to see the shrines. Usually it's sunrise to sunset, depending on the season.Be respectful, no shouting or loud talking. Whisper and don't take any pictures inside the shrine. I get HIGHLY annoyed of obnoxious foreigners with no ETIQUETTE! It makes me want to smack them and tell them the rules and policy when visiting sacred places. SO PLEASE PLEASE make yourself aware of how to act and be respectful when visiting places in Japan. Japan is a beautiful country full of humble people who have the utmost respect for not only one another, but their country as well...so please be respectful, you don't want to be the obnoxious disrespectful foreigner jerks!Front entrance, don't forget to bow once upon entering and once again upon leaving. At the front, Temizuya...rinse both your hands, pour water in your left hand, rinse your mouth, rinse your left hand again, and then rinse the dipper allowing the water to run down the handle of the dipper. DO NOT TOUCH the dipper directly to your lips.Luckily, our great friend Kanata who is Japanese took us here and showed us all the traditional customs..but do not fret...their are rules in English as well and it directs you on how to do things proplerly =)"

The women are dressed in intricate garments, have the sternest look on their face and are flanked by a hundred guests following them. What is more bizarre is the way the wedding is carried out in the public eye and all manner of strangers snap away pictures of your magical day to take home with them.Other than the weddings, the shrine itself is breathtaking.

We made the fortunate yet unfortunate mistake to visit the Meiji Jingu temple on the 3rd of January this year when many of the locals visit their many temples to pray to their deities for the new year. Whilst in this beautiful expanse of greenery, my fiance and I paid 500 yen each to enter the special garden that houses the tea house and fresh water well. Whilst in there we also saw numerous koi in the ponds and fed the local birds peanuts (as directed by a local) from the palm of our hand! We then lined up for approximately 20 minutes to see and 'wash' our hands in the fresh water well. Afterwards, we followed the crowd to the temple itself which was incredibly busy- the whole place was, really. As always, the Japanese were ever organised and there were numerous security which ensured a relatively organised 'journey' throughout the gardens. Definitely worth the experience, though probably best to avoid the first week or so of the new year to escape the crowds. I estimate it took us 2 hours to complete the above, when it would have taken, perhaps 45 minutes on a 'normal' day."

Get a map and make sure you orient yourself all the time to avoid back tracking as this place is very large. There are two places that cost money (donation), one the Well and the other the Treasure Museum. The Well was of historical interest and was pretty cool for how pure the water is coming out of it and how it works, and the Museum had several interesting artifacts. Mostly it was paintings of all the emperors of Japan.The person said it could get you into two places, however the English was so limited I just passed it off as I was tired and done for the morning.This is a great cultural location to visit - I would recommend this to people coming to Tokyo if they are interested in cultural places of interest."

More of a forest than garden although we only stayed 2 hours and there was plenty we missed - the lake. Dry but very cold. We were amazed at how dry everything looked but very beautiful established trees towering above you. Wide gravel paths. Also enjoyed the museum and treasury exhibition inside the gardens. Extra ticket required. 500 yen approx from memory. Both these buildings are widely spaced so allow 20 minutes walking to find each one. The ticket covers entry to both. Treasury Exhibition in new building near cafes etc near main gate. The Museum other side of park in very y old building. Worth it. Some English explanations."

If you have then it is, on the surface as a tourist, much the same as all the others.What I found far more enjoyable were the grounds surrounding the shrine. There are peaceful tracks through the trees, open expanses of grass, and plenty of small wildlife to be seen. It's a great little oasis within the city for a tranquil break. Perfect for a picnic, reading a book, napping or meditating."

It is quite interesting as the architecture differs much from the temples we visited in other countries. We were lucky that it was a good month for marriages, so we saw a few bride and grooms in typical Japanese clothing who visited the temple for their ceremonies. The nice addition is that the temple is conveniently located near the shops and restaurants of Harajuku and Otomosando. Well worth a visit!"

They have one corner counter which have English speaking staff. If you want to make a wish, you can pay 1000yen and they will give u a small wood and you can write the wishes and hang on the designated area."

From Meijijingu-Mae station, it takes less than 1 minute to work to the main entrance (south entrance). One then walks about 10 minutes to go the main shrine (from either the South Gate or East Gate). At the main shrine court, one can wait in line then make offerings while praying. One throws the coins, claps twice, bows once, then prays. When one is done praying, claps and bows again before leave the line. One can also buy a wooden plate and write prayers on it then tie it at the scared tree. My husband and I did not do so, because we do not know the Japanese language (we do not know how to write the characters). Most (99%) people leave from either the South gate or East gate, but I recommend the West gate. It is a much longer walk back to the main entrance, but the path goes through the quiet part of the park. Giant trees are planted on both sides of the path, and the leaves cover the sky (it does get dark around 5pm). Good spot to take pictures!"

This shrine is large and the path approaching it fairly long and uninspiring to be honest.The Shrine itself is a nice complex where you may be able to catch a traditional wedding. However, every time I visited it (3 times including once in 2013) was quite crowded, so much so that taking a decent picture or enjoying what should be a peaceful place, is practically impossible.I would still visit, but without having major expectations."

You could wash your hands traditionally and it was a very relaxing experience. The main museum was closed so I went to the smaller one. I was a bit disappointed because it was only a room filled with artefacts (there is an entry fee for the museum). But don't get me wrong it was very interesting but I don't think it is as good as the bigger museum would be.The visit was very relaxing and fun but I wouldn't spent more than 30 minutes there. But I think that everyone should experience and see this shrine even if it's for 5 minutes.The shrine is a small walk from the train station. I would suggest using a map or asking someone about how to get there in terms of different train lines and some directions."

The over one hundred year trees (forest), racks of Sake along the entrance, ancient and huge timber gates were among highlights. The inside and main ceremony hall look similar to shrines comonly found in Korean. It's an ideal place for a quick walk around and would not feel too terrible to give it a miss if constraint with time. Though there are several nice restaurants inside the Shrine and nearby areas. We had lunch at a restaurant inside the Shrine. It was nice.This place is located steps away from Harajuku subway station and the popular teen Takeshita Dori shopping street, so plan your trip accordingly."

Take the crossroad and you'll see the imposing first Torii gate not far away.There're three Torii gates altgether with some distance in between.

Prior to entering the shrine, you will come across wine and sake offerings and like all shrines, a washing well is just outside the shrine to wash your mouth and hands. Photography is restricted in some parts of the shrine and should be respected. For me, it is terrible to see some travelers disrespect the traditions and rules for visiting. For a fee, you can write down your prayer or wish on a tablet and have it blessed and hung at the shrine. There are quite a few gift shops and some that have nothing to do with the shrine but want to take advantage of the foot traffic."

This very large park in the the middle of a busy area is located within easy walking distance of Harajuku subway station. One could easily spend a half day enjoying the park and shrine but we limited ourselves to the shrine area and the path where barrels of wines from Bordeaux and barrels of sake from all over Japan were stacked as offerings to the emperor Meigi. We were also fortunate to watch a Shinto wedding party march into the shrine. After two hours we moved on to our next adventure"

It was a doable walk. As it was the day before the Autumn festival, we could see the rows upon rows of sake, wine barrels and gifts from around the country in the vicinity of the shrine. We also went into a park within the park (500 yen). I think its called the Meiji Jingu Gyoen to see the tea house (Kakuun Tei) and little pond. There was an old man there photographing the birds and he had seeds for them. The birds will even follow him around. He gave some of the seeds to a western tourist and the birds just flew on to her palm. It's peaceful and calm. As it was late autumn, the flowers were no longer blooming but we still walked the trail to what was an old well (Kiyomasa Ido). It is a very beautiful place for nature with what looked like lovely old trees. And its interesting for me to find out 100,000 trees were actually donated by the people of Japan after the war.We came out at the Harajuku exit into the hustle and bustle of the city."

Walking paths lead to Aoyama, Yoyogi ect giving you a reason to explore these areas.1 point is deducted due to not being able to take photos in the main Temple, & if you want to explore some of the parks & gardens off the main path a \u00a5500 ($5) maintenance fee is required for each attraction.

Conversely, the west, so fascinated by Japan's brilliant beauty could not help but disturb the flower, toppling the entire feudal order that held the Shinto, the Samurai, and the Emperor so delicately in balance. The place is largely self-explanatory, and you will want to spend a morning or afternoon here to really absorb a sense of the cultural heritage of this ancient country. I happened upon a wedding ceremony and procession on the shrine grounds, a testimony that a Shinto spirit still has its place in this culture. Walking shoes recommended.

There are some suggested donation amounts for some of the buildings. Also, some of the buildings close without notice so don't be surprised if you go and some parts are closed."

Firstly the shrine is easily accessible by Harajuku Station on the Yamanote line run by JR so all the JR pass holders it is included.The grounds are large and expansive giving the impression that you are in forest instead of a big city, however once you get to the shrine itself you will realise that the shrine itself is not that big and you can easily appreciate it in a single hour.The Japanese were not people for over the top glamour and extravagance and this is easily noticeable. Mainly all Japanese shrines and places like these are restrained and humble in their beauty and tend to use a lot of wood in construction. It is still an active religious place and if you are lucky you may see traditional Japanese weddings as well as religious ceremonies taking place.There are food stalls, restaurants and souvenir shops nearby."

The shrine itself is interesting since it was constructed rather recently (in the last 100 years) so it is well preserved. The gardens are very nice also."

There is a long walk to the Shrine, but it is lined with trees and it is a very peaceful walk. We went in the early afternoon, so it wasn't too hot. I don't think I would try this in the middle of summer, as the heat and humidity would be a bit too much.The Shrine itself is a beautiful structure, but the setting and peaceful setting is what sets this attraction off as something special. After walking about for 30 minutes, I came out of the Shrine with a new sense of being, a boost of energy and looked forward to my next adventure, which was Harajuku across the street.This is a good place to relax and get away from the hustle and crush of the Tokyo atmosphere. With your batteries re-charged, it is time to head back into the crush of people."

It was situated off the main path and required you to walk along a path that included a nice pond, complete with fish and turtles. The local birds even came up close to you if you had bread (we saw an elderly Japanese gentleman sitting by the pond with little finches eating bread from his hands). Just a little further along, we came across a beautiful garden of flowers that was reminiscent of an impressionist painting, a definite highlight. Kiyomasa's well is a small natural well situated in the middle of this 'forest' park.At the shrine we witnessed a ceremony with a Shinto priest and what appeared to be two business men. It was quite interesting. We weren't allowed to take photos within the shrine or of the ceremony but we could around the grounds.

Our group was blessed by the priest, as were a 3 year old girl, dressed in a beautiful kimono, and her parents, and another couple. Afterwards, we each received a sweet sugar cake to take with us, and a small sip of sake, to drink. The setting was serene, unlike the scene at many shrines and temples, mobbed with tourists.

The Meiji Shrine is nestled between Shibuya, Harajuku and Yoyogi Park which are all very popular tourist attractions and often busy with too much fanfare and activities. Yet right in the heart of all these is a tranquil forest shrouding the Meiji Shrine. Peaceful and quiet, it ranked as one of my favorite tourist location during our recent trip to Tokyo. As with most shrines in Tokyo, you can make a prayer the Shinto style here. Throw a coin into the coin box, bow your head twice, clap twice and bow again. You can also purchase \"omakuji\" poems written by Emperor Meiji and the Empress Showa. We picked 2 omakujis and found they're great advise for our life. I really recommend you to pick up these omakujis.Also check out the Meiji Shrine website (http://www.meijijingu.or.jp/english/index.html) and try to visit during one of their festivals. We're lucky to visit during the Ningyo Kanshasai, a festival to thank protective dolls, and witnessed the ceremony. To get to Meiji Shrine, get on the Yamanote Line and alight at Yoyogi station. From there it takes 15 minutes of walking to Meiji Shrine.We really enjoyed this visit and hope you do too."

The Meiji Shrine is an expansive pavilion and garden that can be part of visiting the Harajuku and/or Yoyohgi areas. An impressive part of the visit is the torii gates that tower 40 ft high, and the sake and wine offerings that adorn the entranceways to the shrine. The locals and tourists alike visit the chozuya basins for purification before entering the shrine. The gardens feature the Kiyomasa Well which is believed to impart some kind of spiritual power. We visited at a time when few of the flowers or botanical features were in bloom, so the gardens were not terribly impressive in August. I think the shrine is a \u201cmust visit\u201d for Tokyo, but mostly because it remains one of the most impressive traditional attractions in Tokyo, but also because it is close to Takeshita Dori, Harajuku and Ebisu and makes for a great part of a day visit along key attractions along the Yamanote Line."

There are big displays of sake barrels offered to the shrine on the way in that make for great photos too.

Visitors come in droves especially around New Year's Day, but on any given day, there could be weddings or children dressed in full traditional garb to ask for blessings. The shrine is next to Yoyogi Park in the Shibuya district of Tokyo, easily accessible by the JR Yamanote line from the Harajuku station. The park itself is a sprawling wooded space where one can take a pleasant stroll away from the bustle of Tokyo, but be wary of mosquitoes, especially at dusk. Be sure to stop at the Meiji Jingu Treasure House, which is a museum of many of the Meiji Emperor's belongings, along with some historical interpretive material, although not much of it is in English. There is also a garden at the south end of the shrine. Both the Treasure House and garden charge and admission of about $4. The shrine complex itself is free."

The gravel path is a little hard to walk in if you're wearing sandals or open-toe shoes, but it's worth it.As soon as your enter the park area you are surrounded by trees on both sides, until it suddenly clears and you see the actual temple. Visitors are encouraged to wash their hands and mouth at the fountain on the left side, and there are fortune telling sticks on the right side.The shrine is inhabited by monks, and sometimes you can see them wandering around in their kimono robes. On the way up to the temple, there is a sort of wishing well located in the forest that is quite interesting as it's said that there is a 'power spot', a sort of super spiritual spot that you can pray at.Hint: there is a short cut behind the restaurant that makes the walk a little shorter. I suggest going up the forest path, but down through the restaurant as the walkway is paved and more direct."

The shrine is actually dedicated to the late Emperor Meiji and his Empress, and them both arguably built the foundation of Japan today. It is a simple shrine, and exceptionally peaceful. However, do not expect a place too fancy as compared to those you may have visited in Kyoto. Take into consideration that the place is located in Tokyo, a high dense metropolitan. If you happen to see it from Tokyo Metropolitan Government office, the shrine is the only big spot of greenery amidst the busy city. Really exclusive.Be prepared to walk a long road and be sure to wear comfy shoes. The road along to the shrine are of tiny pebbles. You may also want to walk along the street of Omotesando, which is right outside Meiji-jinggu"

There is a pavilion for guests to perform ritual purification by washing their hands (and mouths), and there is a kiosk where you can buy a little plaque on which to write a wish or a prayer and hang it up. We happened upon a ceremony and got to see people in robes playing traditional instruments. Visitors stand outside and look into the inner sanctum. I did not see any food or drink concessions, so bring your own water.You can walk to Meiji Jingu in about 25 minutes from Shinjuku station, or take the train. Transit access is on the Odakyu local line on tracks 8 and 9. Proceed to the second stop (Sangubashi), walk south from the station and, at the first corner, look for a pictorial sign indicating the pedestrian overpass to your left. Park entrance is just north of the overpass."

After the first night in our Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, the next day, early in the morning, we headed with our guide to the Meiji Jingu (shrine) in the Tokyo region called Shibuya.First thing that awaited us was the gigant wooden gate,so called Torii, that is the traditional Japanese gate at the entrance of every Shinto shrine in Japan.That is 40-foot-high construction made of 1500- years-old cypress tree and through such giant door, the masses of the tourists pass in 200-acre park every day.This shrine is dedicated to the spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shoken.As soon as we passed the gate, on one side of the central path were exposed barrels of sake in the height of the two-storey wall. Here we stopped for awhile and listened to the very interesting story from the part of our guide, about the tradition of the making of the sake ( the rice wine) and which was donated here to the Meiji Shrine. Further ,as we were going on the tracks of this immense park, toward the Meiji Shrine Complex, we saw many interesting traditional, historic edifices.There is a central sanctuary, where is the Meiji emperor enshrined, then comes the shrine itself, with the vast yard in front of the building. At one place,on the wooden fence, that encircles the big tree, You may leave Your prayer. Again, in the other one ,some women signed the prayers posed on the tables in front of them.Also assisted to the event of the preparation for the wedding, here at the Meiji Shrine.That was the procession of the priests and maidens, which wore traditional dress for such occasion.In the very beginning of our visit to such old country as it is Japan, I was pretty sure that more miracles were to come yet."

Tourists sweating left and right, some walking peacefully, some in tours, we all reached the shrine in various stages of exhaustion (me at the maximum) . I later erred and came out the wrong way, all the way on the other side of the park instead of back where I started, so be careful (I took a cab back to Takashita dori )."

Stroll along the forest path (yes it's not a park but a small forest in the city) and you'll passed through sake or wine barrels. after 15mins stroll you'll be reach the Meiji Shrine. Pay a respect at the shrine by tossed a coins to the box; claps your hand twice then bow then again claps your hand twice. At the main hall you can see hundreds of small wooden boards that hangs below the big tree. In each boards there are wishes from visitors and blessed by the monks every morning, i found myself enjoy reading the visitor's wishes. there is fortune teller and stall that sells japanese charms for luck, health etc. Meiji Jingu entrance is free, but if you want to visit the inner garden and treasure house it cost 500yen each. When you leave the site don't forget to take pictures from the bridge, the sunset view with tokyo skyscrapers is magnificent."

The tree lined entrance is like something from a fairy tale and the age and history oozes from the surroundings.We would go early in the morning before 9AM to avoid the gaggle of tour groups and buses. Only early risers and locals at this time and gives you the best chance for some unobstructed photos."

This shrine is well known as a power spot and you would feel it when going. The shrine is big and very nice place to escape and refresh. Even in the summer, the air is fresh and you would feel the good power from Japanese historical shrine. The reason for this place to be know as a power spot is that the place is located on power trail which is protecting Tokyo area historically. It's one of the major power spot in Tokyo."

The place looks so genuine, as it was built thousand years ago, although it was built relatively recently - around1922.Harmony and tranquility are unique. Japanese style architecture. It is another one of those \"must see\" places.It takes about one hour to get a good feeling of the place and to look at many interesting details around shrine yard. However, if you want to have a look at the whole lot (unfortunately we did not have time to do that) - gardens, treasure museum, martial arts training hall, sacred dance hall etc. you would probably need couple of hours, maybe whole morning.Nice shop half way between the shrine and entry on Harajuku station side. Wide range of souvenirs - pricewise and in terms of quality.Forest leading to shrine is very nice, enjoy every step you make at that place.It would be good to check their website before you go there so you can see if there are any events and at what time. We forgot to do that so we missed daily food offering ceremony (at 8am and 2pm).Have a snack and drink before or after you visit the shrine as there is no restaurant there, and you are not allowed to drink or eat on majority of the grounds as it is sacred area (see on their sitemap which area are exempt from that)."

This major Shinto Shrine is dedicated to the souls of Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, he passed away in 1912 and she in 1914. I thought they must be buried here but no they are buried near Kyoto. The Shrine was started in 1915 and opened in 1920.A magnificent Torii Gate 40 foot high welcomes you at the front entrance to this 200 acre complex which is in a forest setting. When the plan to build the shrine was put in place over 100,000 trees were donated from all over Japan and over seas and were planted by volunteers so that now nearly a hundred years later it looks and feels like a natural forest.When you walk through the front entry Torii it is still quite a long walk before you get to the actual Shrine but it is a lovely walk shaded by all these great trees.The shrine and other buildings are impressive in a plain sort of way, no glitz and bright colours just plain timber with a bit of metal trimming, bronze or copper I\"d say. While we were there we were lucky to witness a wedding which was special, apparently this place is very popular for weddings. Very busy , seems every one want to visit the Meiji Shrine. To me it was very different to others I have seen , no great big areas of manicured lawns or gardens or shaped trees, just a lovely forest setting left to it's own devices to grow and prosper, very natural peaceful place. Maybe Meiji was like that I don't know, a no frills sort of guy who loved nature as it was .There is a gift shop and a couple of places to eat and plenty of rest rooms around the complex, admission is free. Just be careful when you leave the actual Shrine area and venture into the forest there are quite a few different tracks and it is easy to take the wrong one and get a bit lost and it is a big area. Lovely spot to visit, join the crowd and go see for yourself this Shrine built to remember the great Emperor Meiji."

The shrine is a big draw, of course, but the forest that one has to traverse to reach it is worth dawdling in, since it is entirely man-made, having been planted in 1921. The tall trees throwing gloomy shadows over the winding paths which lead to the shrine are an example of Japanese garden architecture which is not often seen elsewhere.You can cross the road from the Meiji Jingu Mae station on Tokyo subway to get to the park, and then follow the broad path to the right to reach the shrine. Almost all the time there are streams of tourists, so it is hard to miss. Watch for the tall gates (torii) on the way: these mark progressively more sacred spaces.The shrine has a fairly strict protocol, but tourists seem to be exempt from most of it. You may read about the history of Japan between the Meiji and Showa emperors to decide whether you want to follow the protocol or not. The kikunogomon (chrysanthemum flower) sign of the imperial house are visible everywhere.In the northeastern corner of the courtyard in front of the shrine you can see the wooden tablet called ema which contain messages from worshipers. A blank tablet costs 500 yen, and you are expected to inscribe a message on it and hang it here.If there are only two things you have time for in Tokyo, then this would be one."

The shrine is located at Yoyogi Park which is one of the larger green lungs if Tokyo and is worth a visit if you're near Shibuya or Harajuku, especially on weekends."

The only saving grace was a Shinto ceremony that involved a ritual with Shinto monks that was worth seeing and the chanting that followed.Yes this place is peaceful and quiet but the shrine itself is bordering on the austere."

We got off the JR Yamanote Green line in Harajuku; the entrance here is a minute from the train station. Admission is free unless you take a side path to see another exhibit - that was 500 yen. There so much greenery - tall trees mask the street noise. There's a lot of walking to get to the shrine. There is a vendor selling various omamori."

The forest around the shrine is wonderfully cool and quiet, especially on a hot day in Tokyo. When we passed by the washing basin, which was very beautiful, and the second gate, we saw the shrine. The shrine is very plain and can not be visited, you can only make a sacrifice and hang a prayer. Also the two bound together trees to the left are very beautiful and inspiring, but all in all its plain, not as overloaded as the temples in Kyoto. The way back to the praking spot is very quiet and shady to walk and I would really recommend that."

For good reason, it turns out. Meiji-Jingu is a very well-known shrine, I'll give you that. But the trek to get to the actual shrine is just unpleasant. It's deceivingly well-located right outside of Harajuku station, and the torii gate is big, awe-inspiring and whatnot (not the most pretty; go to Kyoto's Fushini Inari or Hiroshima's Itsukushima for that), but the trek to get from the entrance/torii gates to the actual shrine is pretty long (a good 5-10 minutes) of big chunks of gravel, so BE PREPARED TO WEAR COMFY SHOES you're not afraid to get a little dust on and BUG SPRAY. The fashion boots I wore didn't have enough support at all for the gravel and I ended up with pretty grey shoes at the end from all of the dust. It's also a nice little escape from the hub-bub of Harajuku, since it has its own park, but that also means mosquitos in the summer.The shrine itself is like any other; I didn't think there was anything remarkable about it, but then again, I'm not a history buff and I've been to 2 of Japan's most famous shrines & 1 very well known temple before visiting here, so it's not the most fair comparison. BOTTOM LINE: If you're only stopping in Tokyo, by all means, go. Otherwise, save it for Kyoto and Hiroshima. Heck, Nara's Todaiji is even better than this, simply because there are deer that roam around temple grounds (which Hiroshima also has, but isn't advertised for some reason)."

Of course, there isn't a ton to do here, but it's well worth the walk through and visit to the shrine. It's nice Japanese architecture, and I happened to be up at the main shrine giving my offering when some special family was taken in for a blessing, which resulted in them banging the drum several times -- lots of reverberation and a sense of their ceremonial rites. There were also a variety of lovely bonsai trees around the arcade in the inner courtyard. If I was going back, I'd probably have gone into the formal gardens area even though I think there's a fee.

Other reviewers have commented on how relaxing it was, and we agreed. There was a wedding during our visit (around 10 am) at the main part of the shrine. We also spent some time walking around the wooded areas.For those of you using Google Maps to navigate - we ended up walking at least 30 minutes more than we needed to to take a northern entrance to the shrine. While there is a lovely forest path there and we enjoyed our walk through the local neighborhoods, follow the groups from the Harajuku entrance if you don't feel like taking an extra walk."

This is a lovely shrine, located within a vast beautiful park.While the shrine itself lacks any \"WOW\" factor, it is still worth the 20-30 minutes walk in the park from its entrance to reach the shrine.The park is also a popular place for joggers, so planning to jog there is also a possibility.I think the best time to visit the shrine and park is in the late afternoon during the summer, when there's still light, but the temperatures had dropped a bit. This time provides the best photo-ops of the shrine."

You can reach this place by JR Harajuku station or the MeijiJunggumae station on the Metro subway line, more straightforward and easier to find at the later line because the walk over to the shrine is more straight forward."

The shrine building is a representative example of Japanese shrine architecture. After its destruction by fire during the World War II, it was reconstructed in the fifties. The gates of the garden are among the most photographed in Tokyo. A visit of the treasure museum (there is a small fee for this) is worth since it contains a lot of information on the Meiji era. The same goes for the outer garden (there is also a fee for this part). There is also a Meiji Memorial hall which is currently used as wedding hall. If you are lucky, you will be able to bring back home some pictures of a Japanese wedding!"

Well, I saw at least 4 to 5 lovely Japanese weddings and a lot of the tourists were taking their photos. The funny thing was that some of those ushers for the couples asked me if I was a guest of the couple, not just one couple but at least for two couples. You will also be able to write your sincere wishes onto a piece of paper and put it inside a envelope and deposit into a box. Alternatively, you can purchase a wooden board and write your wishes and hang the wooden board onto the display standees. My highlight was to purchase the amulets from the Meiji Jingu Shrine. As it was my first time in Tokyo so I was sort of overwhelmed with all the fanciful beautiful amulets and I got myself 11 amulets. They had all types of amulets from love, health, luck, marriage, relationships, air travel safety, study, etc. The average price of each amulet is JPY800."

For a bit of peace, when you've completed your viewing and are in the main courtyard before the central shrine, leave by the west entrance (to the left from the main entrance). Follow that path past a little used water purification fountain and left again onto a path that is a shady green and practically silent save for birds and the wind in the trees. Don't worry about getting lost, the path will actually lead you back to just before the main entrance. Definitely a recharge we needed in a day of sightseeing. Enjoy!"

When I arrive at the shrine, I found out the most famous Sumo wrestlers in all of Japan were about to do some performances in front of the main shrine, including Hakuho. It was really a once in a lifetime experience to see Hakuho and the other yokozuna wrestlers up close and personal. After the performances the crowd dissipated and the line to pray at the shrine itself grew massively long, with waiting times of up to 30 minutes roughly. Overall, a wonderful break from the monotony that is the metropolis of Tokyo and a welcome breath of fresh air."

An emperor and his empress are enshrined here and from the different information points around the shrine they were popular and well loved by the Japanese people. The buildings in the shrine square are wonderful and here and there you will see Shinto monks going about their business. Well worth a visit.

We were there in cherry blossom time but there were none in this area ... just lots of green trees and shrubs. We were there on a Saturday so were lucky enough to witness the bridal preparations and photos for at least 5 different weddings, as well as a couple of bridal processions. It is obviously a popular location for weddings. It just added to the magic of the place. A little bit of peace and serenity nestled in the bustle of Tokyo, and right near a train station so easy to get to. There is a lovely restaurant on the grounds if you need a break.

You will be welcomed by peace and serenity, only with a faint noise that feels so far away. The pathway to the main Meiji ceremonial shrine is made of pebbles and gravels. It is quite a distance to walk inwards before you see, right in front of you, the majestic structure of the Meiji Shrine. This is a tribute to the Meiji Emperor and his Empress. There are many Shinto ceremonies held each year at the Meiji Jingu, and if you are lucky, you may catch a traditional wedding ceremony or even a festival! Getting an omikuji ( 2-liner prose, the Empress' favourite hobby), and the Meiji Jingu stamp, are good and cheap souvenirs. To get to Meiji Jingu, take the train to Harajuku station and upon exit, turn right. Walk straight ahead and you will see a stone bridge. Cross the bridge and you will see the large torii gate. You will then enter the world of Meiji"

I got there early and just beat a few busloads of tourists.Why would you go: It's a wonderful big shrine in an understated Shinto fashion.Why would you skip: It's an easy, but long walk into the shrineI liked the forest you walked through to get to the shrine and if it's peace and quiet you want, instead of exiting through the main pathway that passes the sake barrels, exit the main shrine through the side exit (to your left as you come in the main way) and take that road back to the front. There's only one way to go on that road so don't be afraid you will get lost and there were only 2 people on the road."

It's on the top of the street but there are two entrances and exits to Harajuku station, so don't get off at the Takashita St exit - it's the other one! But if you do (Get off at Takeshita St) all you have to do is walk around the block. So it's located on the top of the street right next to Harajuku St. It can get quite cold in there during the cooler months / end of the year as the trees are so tall they block out most of the sun. It's a lovely stroll into the park, relaxing and quiet. If you keep walking on you reach a wall of Sake barrels and opposite that actual barrels. Keep walking and you will find the shrine. You have the options to traditionally 'bless' yourself and to make a wish. Really relaxing and after that you can head back down to Takeshita Street and around Harajuku/Shibuya"

I went there quite early in the morning. It was cool, not crowded, and I even saw a newly married shinto couple having their photo shoot there. It's surrounded by lots of trees, and I enjoyed listening to the birds chirping as I strolled the area.I would recommend going there in the morning. If you're in a hurry, or your legs are too tired, probably it's best that you skip this attraction, coz you won't be able to enjoy it. The shrine itself was free, but if you want to go to the garden, there's a fee (500 yen, if I'm not mistaken) and it's open at 9am."

I got out of Harajuku station and faced the very hot sun in middle of July, then I turned right to the direction of Meiji Shrine and found a big wooden torii which I thought it was my love at first sight. It's so elegant and beautiful and really attractive. I'd never felt like this when I went to any shrines in Japan before. This is just the gate lead to the big park which I thought was a little jungle with many big trees I didn't expected to be in a city like Tokyo. On the way to the Shrine, I passed by many interesting spots like the sake collections of the emperor. Although the weather was very hot and humid, walking in this park was a pleasant time. At the Shrine, it's quite simple but full of power in my thought. Not colorful like other shrines but full of believes and sincerity. This really fulfilled my time in Tokyo. I loved it and I'd recommend everyone to come here. Trust me, you can miss any shrines or temples in Japan BUT THIS!!! Go there, you won't regret!PS. IT'S FREE!!!!"

There is a paid (called 'contribution' for some strange reason) path which has all sorts of interesting titbits of information about Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. There is also a tea house, a lovely Iris and Azalea garden, a fishing pond, and a well in there!The shrine is quite an imposing structure, but is, as in many cases in Tokyo and Kyoto, overshadowed by its garden.

Well, since the \"park\" where the sanctuary is is enormous, once you keep waking it only gets calmer and more peaceful by the step. It is somehow a magical place. In 5 minutes you went from city to forest. The toriis are made out of natural wood and everything feels raw & natural. The shrine itself is also impressive, quite big and made in dark wood, beautiful. Everything sort of matches together to give you that feeling of being in the middle of greatness. I was there on a weekday, and it was not busy at all. Fantastic for roaming around & pray without having a hard time to concentrate (which as a foreign not used to do it in japanese style was a common problem for me! he).

It is amazing that such an atmosphere can be created by just a few turns in the walkway - all this within a very busy city.Assess to the shrine is very convenient by the JR Yamanote Line which makes it within easy reach of any of the main areas where visitors are likely to stay. There is of course no admission fee and no hassles by anybody.Those who have time, should consider also visiting nearby Harajuku and the shopping on Omotosando."

It is located in kind of a park, so as you walk through the Torii you forget the city outside and feel the peace that surrounds it. The temple itself has has a big patio with two huge trees that are cut round; one of them is called the tree of life, so you can offer a written prey on it. As you walk back to the park for the exit, don't forget to check the wine barrels that are exposed as acknowledgment for the French wine producers who donate it for the monks' consumption, since Meiji time, and the sake barrels as well."

The entrance of the shrine is just 5 mins away from the train station. It will take you another 10 minutes to walk to the main Shrine. Check the weather condition before going as there is no shelter from the main entrance to the main Shrine. It was a perfect weather,so cooling, the walk in was peaceful and calming.

This is a huge property with tons of things to see, so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. I went in July, where it was very very hot.

I have visited this place many times over the years, with family, friends, kids, teens...This amazing Shinto shrine ( the Imperial Household uses this) is smack dab in the middle of a busy area, beside noisy, colourful Harajuku, at the end of high fashion Omotesando Dori and beside Yoyogi Park where there always seems to be some festival or party going on. Once you enter the long, tree lined avenues leading up to the shrine, it's like being sent back in time. Huge cedars and enormous torii ( gates) mark the gravel path and the dark wood structure with it's contrasting white accents embodies the true nature of Shintoism. Make sure to stop and read through any of the information brochures available or look it up ahead of time so that you can have your own guided walking tour and understand what exactly you are seeing. Purify your hands at the fountain. The garden is at it's best when the irises are in bloom in June (this has an entry fee) but is totally worth if if you are there then. The rest of the year there are plenty of fabulous gardens everywhere in. Tokyo to see ( Happo en, Korakuen, and the garden at the Nezu Museum are my recs). If you are lucky you can catch sight of a wedding procession at Meiji Jingu, complete with red and white clad assistants, and heavy silk furisode wedding kimono on the bride. In the summer sun they walk under big red traditional parasols. If you are there in the warmer months, this place seems so much cooler than the rest of the city under the big shade trees. If you are there in the winter, note that the bathrooms on site in the woods are clean and have heated toilet seats! You can plan your visit to the surrounding area all in the same day ( Yoyogi, Harajuku, Omotesando, Meiji. Jingu. Note: the super souvenir store on Omotesando Dori ( Oriental Bazaar) is closed on Thursdays. The Ota Woodblock museum is a terrific small place on Omotesando as well."

Once we have reached the main shrine there are for sure a lot of tourists and locals, yet there is still a possibility to enjoy this place without feeling rushed or crowded and that is by just taking a step back and walking along the outskirts of the courtyards. There are beautiful trees, prayer offering opportunities and treasuries to explore. No entrance fee apart from 500yen per person for the adjacent Meiji park (not compulsory)."

Upon returning another morning at approximately 9am there were less than 10 people i could see. Inside the main shrine there were a few more but not many. The walk to the shrine was magnificent. The early morning temperature and a hint of fog and the city yet to awaken made it a pretty surreal and serene experience. I am so glad i returned and had a proper inspection. I don't believe it would have been quite the experience with the crowds. There is also a ceremony held every morning(either 7am or 8am..) if you're up early enough."

Beautiful gardens and a relaxing walk, we were there in winter and they had ice sculptures lining certain parts of the avenues. The temple itself was interesting and as it was a public holiday when we were there a number of the Japanese girls were in their kimonos with their family to celebrate. The temple visit is free but we paid an extra $5 to visit the inner gardens which were pretty bleak in winter but the highlight was an area where the birds in the trees come down and perch on your hand to eat bread crumbs - got some great photos! We got off the metro at Harajuku station to get here and you can walk down to Shibuya crossing quite easily from here as well."

We really enjoyed the tradition of cleansing our hands before entering the shrine and you could write a prayer for the future and it would be transposed onto wood and hung from the prayer tree.We didn't visit the well despite paying 500yen for the trail as the queue was too long.Enjoyable morning out and worth a visit!"

It was a national holiday, too, so there was a bit of a crowd, which made the experience even more fun for me. Kids in their finest kimonos, families all dressed up, a Shinto wedding procession... I was just soaking it all in!There are certain parts of the area where an admission fee is required, but even if you stick to those that don't, you will still be sure to have a great time.It's very accessible from the Harajuku Station and is also close to other key attractions, so you can include it in a one-day itinerary.

I was not sure what to expect, but in the heart of a city is this huge park of beautiful trees. A wide path draws you to the Shrine. Read the etiquette on their website and be sure and take part in the respectful rituals - the bowing when entering, washing your hands, mouth at the font and then bowing, clapping, bowing at the Shrine. While the thought of doing these rituals \"in front of others\" was uncomfortable, doing them help me connect to the site, the history and the harmony of the whole place - which made this a very peaceful and worthy use of \"a few hours to kill\" (and a highlight of the trip). For the rest of my visit, I tried to figure out how to go back - but could not work it in but was so glad i went."

There are various stops along the way for photo ops and also a inner Kiyomasa's Well you can pay to see. Going in September none of the flowers were in bloom; however, there were lots of insects, birds and lily pads to see. If you're short on time, skip this portion, there is also a few to get in. I believe it was 500\u00a5 per person. Once past the old saki barrels you can go left and see a large gate which leads to the main shrine or if you continue straight/right that is also another option, but you approach the main shrine from the side.We had the fortunate opportunity to be there on a day when there were three different wedding processions occurring. It was a lovely treat to see a traditional ceremony. Granted, I'm sure that those booking their wedding at the shrine expect people to stop and watch, all the groups were very gracious.To the right of the shrine is where you can buy amulets and charms. As well, have your fortune \"read\". It's 100\u00a5 and you shake the wooden box, read the number and advice the staff inside the booths. They then provide you your fortune in either Japanese or English. There is a place to make donations at the main shrine and to its immediate right you can write well wishes on an ema. I believe that was 500\u00a5. We accessed the park grounds from I believe the south? Closest to Harajuku station and it was a quick walk in towards the main shrine area. It's an odd sense of self as you walk out of the park with all of its history and immediately step back in to the present. I lovely culture and history and would say this is definitely worth a stop! Beware there can be mosquito warnings at certain times of the year, so if that's when you are there be sure to have mosquito repellant and/or long sleeves/pants."

It is a bit of a trek along a pleasant wooded path to the shrine which is dedicated to the Emperor Meiji, who was the first westernising emperor, and to his Empress. On the way there you can see several wooden Torii (gates) as well as dispays of wine saki barrels. The shrine itself is of average interest but the prayer plaques are interesting. It was full of tourists/pilgrims from Japan and other Asian countries. Many Japanese children had been brought there - the girls in traditional Japanese dress and a few boys in Western suits. There were also some Shinto wedding ceremonies with the bride and groom and most lady guests in traditional Japanese dress and most of the male guests in Western suits. All of this added interest but I do not know if they occur other than on a Saturday which is when I was there. Apparently, this is a major destination for Japanese to make their first shrine vislt of the year in the first few days of January."

This trip, I also got to see quite a few wedding couples going through the rites and taking wedding photos in their traditional costumes. In addition, I was very blessed to have chosen to visit the shrine on the 15th Nov, which happened to be the Japanese Shichi-Go-San (lit. \"Seven-Five-Three\"). It is a traditional rite of passage and festival day in Japan for three- and seven-year-old girls and three- and five-year-old boys to celebrate the growth and well-being of young children. Lovely children in their colourful kimono were all over the shrine, mostly posing for photos with their family members. The usually solemn shrine had become the playground of the lively children. It was very heart-warming to see the children enjoying their time with their families.I will surely visit the shrine again."

What's lovelier is seeing the locals: there were multiple weddings taking place that morning (one after another), and many young children dressed up in kimonos accompanied by their parents.There is a tree with votive tablets/offerings hung all around it. You can purchase/donate and receive a tablet for your own prayer/wish and add it to the tree as well; it was nice to pause and reflect for a while what I wanted to wish for.

Once you get through the first Torii, you are led to what could be one of the most positive places in the whole in Japan (without knowing it).Young travellers only occasionally think about family when they travel. Meiji Jingu will change that. You'll see families happily bringing their kids - all dressed up in their kimono best - to attend Shinto protection rituals, their parents and grandparents beaming proudly. Young people going through their coming-of-age ceremonies. Happy couples getting married and parading with their entourage. Old couples praying piously but happily. All simultaneously happening in a centuries old shrine with comparatively very little bells and whistles - very Japanese. And then you remember your family back home. Not that you suddenly want to go home, but you happily realise you're not dreading the thought so much."

If you only visit Tokyo on a trip to Japan, and are only staying a few days, and only have a little time to look around, and big old (looking) buildings are your thing, then maybe a quick trip to Meiji Jingu is worth it. Frankly, it takes about 30 seconds to look at it, stick your nose inside, and then walk out. The grounds are nice, the walk into the area pleasant enough, but it is hardly a highlight of Japan. Yes, it is quiet compared to much of the huge metropolis. But if you came to Tokyo for a quiet relaxing break...hmmmm. And you cannot eat your packed lunch there, oh no, much to disrespectful. Go to the park next door.Are there better temples/shrines in Tokyo? Well, since they are all pretty similar, and only the surroundings differ it is much of a muchness.Better than nothing if this all the 'temple trekking' you are going to get."

That said if Tokyo is the only destination on your whirlwind tour of Japan (or you're just not a huge culture buff, like me) Meiji Jingu is nonetheless a must see. Right in the heart of one of the busiest cities in the world you would be forgiven for thinking you'd suddenly stepped into a rural setting - the shrine surrounds are bordered with thick woods and the noises of the busy city are eerily absent. It's a truly peaceful place and a stroll around the grounds are guaranteed to calm the nerves of even the most frazzled tourist.As for the temple buildings themselves they are a pretty stock standard examples of those throughout the country. If you're lucky you may glimpse monks busily at work or a heavily adorned traditional wedding ceremony. Feel free to cleanse your hands and mouth with the blessed water (instructions are on the English guides for the novices amongst you) or make a wish to the shrine deities (don't forget to add an offering).My favourite way to get there is to get off at Yoyogi station, stroll alongside the train tracks down the back alleys to the left of the station exit and venture into the temple grounds through the sweeping back gates. It's a lovely walk.Meiji Shrine is, among other things, an excellent way to unwind and detoxify from the unending exerberance that is Tokyo. Make sure you visit, if only for a moment, to bask in the cities more chill side."

Having come from the excitement of the city, walking in on a broad pedestrian path past quiet woods was like being transported to a different world altogether. Dedicated to the spirits of Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, the royal association is evident in the chrysanthemum symbols placed on the cross beams of the massive toriis (at the entrance and another along the path) that you pass under. Along the way, we passed the (now empty) sake barrels that were donated by various manufacturers from around the country for the shrine's use for the year. Even though it was mid-afternoon, the crowds were still there, and this made for an air of devotion at the shrine. The shrine is also apparently very popular for weddings, and we were lucky enough to come across a wedding couple (with their families) that had undergone a blessing ceremony.Access to the shrine and its surrounding park varies with when you visit. Opening hours start before sunrise (although surrounding attractions like the garden and museum open at 9.00 am) but closing time varies by up to 2 hours depending on the month, so it's best to check their website before you go. I didn't see any signs regarding dress codes but like all religious buildings, it's probably best to dress sensibly."

It's a very peaceful and lovely park, rarely crowded even while being in the middle of a bustling area. At different times of year you can see a variety of flowers blooming, and there are many trees and areas for strolling. The shrine itself is impressive. Many people like to have a traditional wedding there, so you just might see one when you visit. The Shinto shrine is very traditional and is dedicated to the spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Sh\u014dken. The Emperor and Empress are considered to be divine. A research institute located in the park is dedicated to studying their divine attributes. Shintoism is the original Japanese religion that is very much a part of Japanese life. It has no founder or holy book. It is focused on virtues such as living with sincerity and harmony with nature. Followers of Shintoism believe in a multiplicity of beneficent divine spirits called Kami. Many Japanese people include both Shinto and Buddhist traditions and ceremonies in their lives. The Meiji Jingu park area is about 175 acres, with thousands of trees, and many flower beds and ponds. It was created in 1920, about 6 to 8 years after the passing of the Emperor and Empress. Well worth the visit, even if you only have an hour.You'll notice some ceremonial practices, such as hand washing, taking in some incense smoke, donating some coins, and doing a double hand clap. It's fun to watch others and then partake in the practices yourself."

The beautiful buildings are very interesting in themselves, and there are often displays of whatever the local festivals are focused on at the time (for example farm produce around harvest time, crysanthemums earlier in the year), monks performing daily rituals and ceremonies, and if you are lucky you may see a traditional wedding (this is a prestigious venue). Of course there are the usual votive tablets to be written and hung on the sacred trees, charms for sale etc too. There is also a botanical gardens although there is an extra charge for this. I don't recommend a visit at New Year though - thousands upon thousands of people turn out and we ended up pressed into a large , unmoving queue on the main path from 9pm until almost 1am! While it was nice to hear the bells, there are more fun ways to spend an evening. The rest of the year though, this is a serene and lovely place to visit, and we always bring visitors here.

There weren't too many people there when we visited one morning so you could wander around and enjoy the peace. The wooden buildings with copper roves are beautiful. There is an area to wash hands and an incense burner. Those who wish can purchase charms or prophecies to present at the shrine. A bonus when we were there was seeing a traditionally dressed wedding couple posing for photos. Another quiet walk through the woods brings you back to the car park."

A route (15 mins walk) leads from the Harajuku Station through a tranquil forest to the Main Shrine. We were greeted by a huge wooden Torii gate at the main entrance. The toriis are commonly found at Shinto shrines and temples and represent a unique icon of Japan. No visit to Japan would be completed without a photo with a Torii.The main building inside the shrine is the Offering Hall. We needed to walk through a large square to offer our prayer. At the right side of the hall, there is a fence around a tree which many \"Ema\" are hung. An Ema is a wooden plate which you use to write your wishes.There is an inner garden (500 Yen) which is famous for the Iris flowers. They are supposed in full bloom in June. We went a a tad too early and only a few of them are fully bloomed. The garden is good enough for a stroll but in my opinion can be avoided if you do not have a lot of time. There is also a Homotsuden (Treasure Museum) which we did not explore.The experience at the Meiji Jingu Shrine is an enjoyable one. Compare with other temples and shrines I have visited, the setup of the shrine may not be very impressive but the atmosphere and culture that bind to the holy ground are invaluable. Seeing many Japanese (young and old) offering their sincere prayers at the shrine, I could see the highly-esteemed place Meiji held inside their hearts. I could finally understand the reason why Japanese couples like to celebrate the wedding at the Meiji Jingu Shrine. Do not miss this place when you have the chance to visit Tokyo."

The wide gravel pathway leads you through two enormous wooden torii gates with beautiful brass embellishments. Sake barrels lined part of the pathways as you make your way deeper into the forest canopies and to the shrine. I arrived just in time to witnessed a Nikkusai ceremony of a mass of 45 children and priests in crisp white robes. Food was offered to the deities with prayers of prosperity and world peace. It was a tremendously humbling and beautiful sight to behold. This is held at 8am and 2pm everyday so time your visit.

More interesting is that it is only on the opposite side of Harajuju Tokeshita Dori which has all the excitement. Tip: When you go in, you will see a few places where you need to pay. Just skip all this and go to the main temple first. Once you see the temple, you may not want toenter these places/gardens at all."

Its main attraction besides the wonderful well maintained grounds is the Temple and Shrine dedicated to Emperor Meiji and his wife Shoken. It's a wonderful place that oozes with history and tradition and maybe you will be Lucky enough to be the witness of a Japanese wedding! ( I think it was a wedding unless it was something else....Nonethelss it was wonderful! I am no specialist but any person eager to learn more aboput that period of Japanese History should pay a visit to the Temple and shrine.

This will make your trip to the Meiji Jingu even more special.I like the place for the fact that it taught me a bit of the Japanese history. This place was built really because of the people's love for their Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. Since this is the centennial year since Empress Shoken's passing, there are some displays lined up along the way to the main shrine area to inform the visitors of what she had done in the past. I went away full of admiration for the empress. She really loved the poor, not only in Japan, but all over the world. This place is a nice break from the hustles and bustles just outside of it since this is in the Shibuya area. Most part of Meiji Jingu is free."

I was there from about 4pm to 6pm on a weekday. Can't stay long as they were closing, but it was less crowded. Just wrote some wishes at the wishing tree, and had to leave soon after.Tip: If you are carrying your luggage due to late flight in the evening or night, just give it a miss. I saw travellers carrying big luggage with trolleys and you cant possibly roll them on the gravel surface all the way in to the site. An alternative is to leave your luggage in a locker in a train station. If you are on heels, then you have to walk carefully."

It enshrines Emperor Meiji who is still held in high regard as being responsible from ending Japan's isolation from the west. For me the shrine itself is not a great visual spectacle (unlike Senso-Ji) but what makes it a good attraction are the adjacent grounds and parks ideal for a picnic and the authentic Japanese feel of the place. In addition there are other attractions nearby that can easily fill half a day. I visited on a Sunday and was fortunate to see a wedding with the bride in traditional dress. Also in the park area behind the shrine there was a large group of school children practicing Kendo which was interesting to see. At the entrance just as you exit the station you have a small bridge where sometimes the Harajuku Cos play kids can be seen but despite me being there on a Sunday I didn't see any. Also 2 mins walk from the shrine entrance is Yoyogi gyoen (park) also worth a visit. If you walk for 2 mins in the opposite direction from the metro station you reach Takeshita Dori street but for me this was very much over hyped, with no authenticity, just throngs of tourists crammed into a small side street. You can also walk to Omotesando street for high end shopping too. In summary I think the shrine in combination with its neighbouring attractions makes for a nice few hours and well worth the visit."

Beautiful shrine which is conveniently located next to the brilliant Yoyogi Park and near the excellent Harajuku shops...Beautiful grounds and great for photos. They had a traditional Japanese wedding on when we went. This is not a complaint (more of an observation/warning) to be careful if you have a stroller or expensive shoes as the long walkway to the shrine is dusty stones. The dust got all over my shoes and the stones made the wheels to the stroller \"bog down\" meaning a heavy shove and biceps of steel were needed to push my baby. Not a complaint I repeat but had I known this I would have done things differently. Well worth a visit!!!"

It is not a long walk as some claim, just a stroll from the station through a beautiful woodland setting in the heart of the city. Planted and built less than 100 years ago, this April saw the centenary of the death of the Empress to whom it is dedicated (jointly with the Emperor Meiji). I was there the Sunday before and there were lots of things going on. I am not sure if there would be so much at other times. At the entrance there was a stage with spectacular dancing, drumming and Kabuki style entertainment. In the main courtyard there was large scale dancing, martial arts and a marching band made up of school children - all perfectly drilled yet obviously thoroughly proud and enjoying themselves. I understand this is often the place to see traditional Japanese weddings but the entertainment more than made up for missing that."

The various pavilions were circumvented with beautifully developed trees stylishly grown on the brink of open fields and little ponds containing spawning carps and koi's. The Meiji shrine in commemoration of the highly-respected Emperor Meiji, reflects the loving contribution of the Japanese people, in one of the green oasis in Tokyo, just a brief walk from Harajuka subway station. The very down to earth architecture and use of simple colors with a preponderance of the natural stained wood. The courtyard centre is freely accessible, the shrine itself cannot be entered however. Interestingly, it is a site that enthrals people to marry, allowing the undersigned to see the beauty of people wearing colourful kimono's accompanied by traditional boring suits, and ad libitum happy laughter whether disguised by hand or not. The shrine may be modest in comparison to others, but in Zen spirit just harbours its own beauty."

The shrine itself is very nice and has many picture opportunities but also the trails to the shrine and the park around the area is very nice. There are some facilities for grabbing a quick bite to eat or a snack near the entrance from the train station. I would rank this as one of the best tourist type spots that I went to on my trip to Tokyo for a couple of reasons, one is the upkeep at the shrine is very good and the second is that the general area and yoyogi park are also great to spending time in. Budget a whole day if you want to do the shrine, the park, and harajuku."

It was great to go to the shrine for a nice quiet walk and say a little prayer once at the shrine. The shrine is such a beautiful contrast between Japan's cultural history and modern advancements as it's an old shrine surrounded by the tall modern skyscrapers of Tokyo.It's located within walking distance to Shibuya's Harajuku Street that is also a must see with heaps of very cool clothing stores and cafes."

You just follow the crowd and it is very orderly \u2013 going clockwise. You get to the shrine and follow the locals \u2013 throw your money in and make a wish I guess or ask for forgiveness!? We preferred this shrine to Asakusa Sensoji temple, feeling it more \"traditional\" - perhaps setting in the park amongst beautiful trees adds to the whole atmosphere. It seems more tranquil as well - maybe because it is \"within\" park environment whereas Asakusa feels like right bang within city life.

Hoping to avoid the crowds, I reached around 8 in the morning and there were very few people around. Walking through the wide gravel paths of the forested park to the shrine was therapeutic. There are small streams, little gold-topped lantern pagodas, a wall of saki and a great torii gate before you reach the shrine. The first thing you notice as you enter the shrine gate is the two large, perfectly sculpted trees fronting the shrine. Perfect for a photo shoot if you have a wide angle lens. There were nuns and monks in their white and red outfits quietly doing maintenance. It was all very tranquil. A must visit if you are in Tokyo but an early visit to avoid the crowds is well worthwhile."

We decided to walk from Shinjuku to Harajuku via the main path through the Meiji Jingu gardens; we were blessed with a beautiful crisp morning with sunlight filtering through the tall trees. Many locals were taking a peaceful Sunday stroll which added to the calm aura. We returned on another day for a specific visit to the Shrine and the Inner Garden, which is aptly described as 'an oasis in the centre of a noisy city'. Although we visited in December when most of the flowers were 'hibernating', the garden and the Well were beautiful and unforgettable. The Shinjuku Gardens are remarkable but be sure to also spend time at Meiji Jingu for a different but equally beautiful experience."

Meiji Jingu could be compared to Central Park in New York but the only difference is that a few steps into Meiji Jingu, and you immediately feel as though you're in 17th century Japan, far from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Located just to the right of Harajuku Station, Meiji Jingu houses a Shinto temple complex set in a lush park with man made fishing ponds, torii gates, and some of the finest traditional Japanese architecture in Tokyo (similar to the kind you would find in Kyoto or Kamakura). One of my favorite things to do is look at the wooden prayer plaques hanging on stands and read the messages of those who have visited and left their prayers in many languages amongst the ones written in Japanese. I would recommend going to Meiji Jingu after a long day walking around the city to get some quiet time.......oh! and enjoy an ice cream while you're at it."

The messages are then used by Shinto priests in the rites of purification. Following the ceremony the dolls are disposed in a proper and respectful fashion.We had such an experience watching the thousand of people coming with their bags of dolls to participate in the event, that we will not forget it."

That said, the temple pays perfect homage to the Meiji Emperor and Empress, two excellent regents of the modern age, with its juxtaposition of the ancient and the modern. Situated right smack in the middle of the city, this temple truly represents the convergence between Japan's past and present, and is a testament to how the Japanese have managed to conserve the things that matter. The temple also features interesting little exhibits and structures (such as a collection of nicely mounted wine barrels), in a wonderfully tranquil environment. There's plenty of walking involved, so dress comfortably on a hot summer's day."

We were lucky enough to see 3 traditional wedding processions (after the ceremony on the way to photographs). Interesting to watch as it is very formal. We also saw many children aged between 3-7 yrs in traditional kimono (boys and girls). Apparently, it was 7,5, 3 Children's Day.. They were so adorable accompanied by very proud parents and grandparents. The temple and grounds were lovely too. We wrote a blessing on a tablet of wood for 500 yen and wandered through the forest that was planted in honour of the Emperor and Empress. It was a lovely peaceful sanctuary in the hectic bustle of the Harijuku area."

Was lucky to visit on day when there was a ceremony to commemorate Emperor Meiji's birthday. It was a v beautiful event. The shine is built in honor of Emperor Meiji, the 1st Emperor of Japan who also opened Japan to the west and modernised education. Nov 3rd is also the national Culture Day in which arts, culture and education are honored. Check out the website for the list of events for the month you are visiting and it will make it more memorable. Its amazing that a place so central in busy Tokyo can be so serene and beautiful. The shrine is across the road from where the Takaeshita Dori is, so best time to visit is sunday and then you can cross the road to see the cosplay and famous Harajuku dressings. Further down is the Aoyama Dori where the branded shops are."

The details in the architecture such as the little hearts in the iron work are lovely. This is an easy sight to see in conjunction with a stroll on the other side of the subway station through Harajuku Street where all the stylized fashion is..it's like seeing the two sides of the Tokyo coin!"

It is a great and quick escape into nature and experience the serenity of not just the greens but also the holy grounds of Meiji Jingu.There are lots of wooden arches around that is pretty magnificent in size and they also have a restaurant and a snack bar along the way with a gift shop! I didn't actually enter the shrine because I didn't have enough time to spare but it was still a wonderful stroll in Yoyogi Park.A recommended place to visit!"

Meiji Jingu is a wonderful park that has an interesting temple right in the middle of the overwhelming busy Shibuya district in Tokyo.It is like going from fire to water...very peaceful, containing a forest which is said to have 700.000trees, it has nice ancient wooden gates and examples of sake containers on the way to get to the temple. It is said as well that trees from all over Japan were donated when the temple was being built. It is a long walk worth while. The temple is a Shinto temple that was built at the beginning of the XX century in honour to Meiji Emperor and his wife. It was destroyed during the World War II and re-build in the 50s. When I visited, I learned a lot about the Emperor and his ruling through a set of pictures placed in muralsalong the way to the temple.It is quite interesting for those who want to learn about history of Japan in a agreeable and peaceful environment. It is also a nice place to meet locals, who enjoy the park as a relaxing place."

Nonetheless, it is an impressive site with a large courtyard and a pleasant forested walk leading up to it."

It was also lovely and cool, which was pleasant after the hot Sunday crush of Harajuku (highly recommended!).

It's among the most sacred shrines to the Japanese and plays host to many ceremonies during the year. It also reveals its standing to the Japanese as it is a frequently used sight for weddings (I was there on two separate occasions and witnessed two wedding ceremonies and saw family portrait photos being taken for the third). One has to keep in mind that it wasn't designed or built with the expectations of visiting foreigners in mind.That said, judging it as a non-Japanese person, it is as I described. The Torii gates are among the most beautiful I have seen in Japan, the walk through the parks [there's actually two separate parks making up the grounds] is simultaneously cooling (not relevant, however, when the weather does not make \"cooling\" a plus), calming and refreshing.The arrival at the shrine, however, is a bit anti-climatic (its sacredness aside). The architecture is fairly plain and unadorned (in fairness, it is a memorial shrine dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his Empress). The courtyard, which is utilized in large numbers by the Japanese for celebrations/ceremonies, is nonetheless empty and a bit sterile in its non-utilized state. There's a feeling of barrenness as you stand there.To those who love parks and nature, this is a definite reprieve. Absent that, judging it not as a spiritual Japanese person would but as someone who looks for beauty, form, spirit, culture, etc., it is fairly non-moving. I'll take a beautiful Japanese garden (wet or dry) or a Temple like Senso-ji over this any day.But it is important to the Japanese and, to that extent, it must be recognized and respected. But there's no requirement to over-value its appeal to a non-follower of either Shintoism or Buddhism."

Look at the stunning architecture and sit under the cloistered walkway watching the world pass. This is a beautiful location to visit.

Hidden in amongst the high rise buildings is this enormous shrine dedicated to the country's favourite Emperor. Definitely lets you get to grips with the spiritual culture of Japan which is so different to that of the West."

The amazing thing about the serenity was that the shrine is located in Shibuya, which is just full of life and vibrancy! The shrine was beautifully constructed and a popular spot for weddings, so keep an eye out for that (we happened to see three!) I recommend this spot to anyone visiting Tokyo and they will definitely appreciate the peace and quiet that Meiji Jingu exudes."

I remember vividly how beautiful it was, with its green roof, lining lantern against the gloomy sky. Some unforgettable experience can be had here. Come on the weekend like we did, you might find a traditional Japanese wedding in progress. They don't mind if you stand and watch or take photos as long as you keep respectful distance. Do get a wood piece from the temple office and write your hopes, dreams and wishes on it and hang it on the wishing board. It's also very interesting to see what people wish for. It's really touching to read some of the many hopes and dreams from people from all walks of life, circumstances and nationalities. You will never forget your visit here. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. :)"

In any case, if you are a fan of photography this is a pretty place to take some nice shots of beautiful trees, lamps, japanese carpentry and of the sort. The temple itself (as always) is beautiful. You can pray (which i did) or just respect and appreciate the beliefs of the people who do. Its a tranquil place and you may even spot some monks passing by. There are little shops located on either side of the temple for souvenirs. i purchased a nice pair of beads for meditation and a small wooden model of part of the temple. Pricing is respectable. There are bathroom facilities located throughout the park and they are superbly clean!! There is also a bigger shop for souvenirs and a cafe with \"ice cold\" airconditioning if you want to get out of the sun. A good way to take a break :).id definitely recommend this place as a starter to your tour"

The considerably long walk to the main shrine gives you the chance to enjoy the peaceful surroundings, green trees and reflect on your day. When I got to the shrine, there were several elderly Japanese gentlemen paying their respects, an image I thought to be most memorable. There were also a fair number of younger people similarly paying respects or admiring the centuries-old architecture. Don't go there expecting many shops like Sensoji or grand, towering structures. The shrine is a bit more subdued but elegant in its own way.Good walking shoes are recommended owing to the walking distance. Also allow a fair amount of time to appreciate this important site in its entirety."

It really is an oasis of quiet and that makes the shrine more amazing.It is not very old but that doesn't make it less worthwhile visiting. We walked around, soaked up the atmosphere and took some great pictures.

The quite lanes leading to the Meiji Jingu shrine are very peaceful and the scenery lovely. There is frequently something happening at the temple - this time it was a traditional wedding ceremony which was fascinating to observe."

I'm not going to say this shrine is as atmospheric as Asakusa, but its completely different in the fact its set in the centre of a quiet park rather than in urban Tokyo. It is quite a walk to get to it from either of the stations, but its so worth it! You walk down a huge lined path in a dead straight line its just beautiful. When you arrive at the attraction there is a lot of wooden gates, and it is fairly spread out. One word of warning, they don't like you taking photos of the ceremonial area, I got told off! Its fairly quick to get around but there is some beautiful artwork/architecture to admire. On your way out there is a wonderful garden to explore (costs extra) with a fountain which is suppost to have unique water, I will write about this in a separate review as it was one of the most spiritual experiences I had ever had anywhere in the world, i still cant explain it! Overall put it on your list of to-do's in Tokyo!"

The kids were dressed in beautiful kimonos and yukatas while being paraded about before being blessed by a Shinto priest. A fascinating site with rich history. A time to avoid, or a time to go if you are adventurous, is the first week of the new year. This shrine will hose 3,000,000 people during the first five days fo the New Year, so expect extreme crowd and long lines. I have done it, it was very fun, but I won't do it again during that time of year.

The shrine itself is very tranquil and if you get the timing right (late after noon, early evening before closing seems best) you can get the place almost to yourself. Compared to other Tokyo shrines which are all very touristy, this one is more pure. It's certainly not as elegant as some, but also not too overpowering.The shrine is dedicated to the emperor Meiji and his empress Shoken. The shrine was built in 1920. There are also two museums here, the 'Treasure' museum contains general items used at the time as well as a horse carriage. There is also an annex which contains various exhibitions depending on the time.Do pick up the free guide at the entrance. A great place outside all the hustle and bustle on a sunny afternoon."

One of the wood of the big gate in front of the park that leads to the shrine was actually replaced from Taiwan due to breakage few years back. Also note that you have to walk by the side of the path road, because based on the Japanese belief, the center pathway is solemnly for their Gods. The path itself offers a relaxing walk towards the shrine. The Japanese come here usually to make a prayer and wishes. They will normally pray in front of the opened space of the shrine. You can do that too, just observe how do they do it, and also a 5 Yen coin in your hand. Definitely worth a visit!"

A little further down are large, decorated barrels of sake for the New Year's celebration. The park is very peaceful even when busy and is very large. You can wander for hours here! The shrine is in the middle of the park and is quite large. It is an active shrine, and you will likely see traditional weddings taking place as we did. You are welcome to purchase offerings and post them as many visitors do. The most common offering is a small wooden plaque that you write prayers or wishes on, then hang on the structure with the others...you can't miss it. Respectful behavior is necessary, but you are welcome to wander around and take plenty of pictures. There are public toilets throughout the park, as well as food and museums (Meiji Treasure House/Annex-recommended). At the upper end of the park, near the museum, are some lakes with plenty of turtles, birds, and large koi meandering around.Do check ahead of time for the park/museum/shrine operating hours, as certain days/hours of the week they are closed. Many places in Japan are like that anyway, so it's a good idea to plan ahead!"

There is a purification well and a wall of prayers left by visitors. Priests and nuns dress in traditional Shinto garb. Photographs of the staff are forbidden. The shrine is a popular place for weddings. We saw a wedding there in traditional Shinto costume, in blush pink and dark navy colors, beautiful and somber. Apparently there is a sports stadium in the outer temple. There is a small ice cream shop just outside the gates, selling interesting soft serve ice cream with flavors like wasabi, taro, sweet red bean."

While I felt the temple itself wasn't anything amazing, the overall peaceful ambiance is something worth checking out, especially to get away from the congestion of Tokyo and the subway stations. The torii gate at the entrance is quite impressive; reportedly the largest in Japan. It's quite a walk TO the temple, but the area is peaceful and beautiful; the gravel path is enshrouded with huge trees and lots of shade. The barrels of Sake at the beginning of the temple area also make for some nice, colorful photos. We were fortunate enough to witness a wedding party posing for pictures at the temple in traditional Japanese wedding clothes. Like most temples we saw, this one also included the purification fountain and wish/prayer board."

The peace is perfectly balanced to not be deafening but enough to transport you somewhere out of the city. Take your time walking further into the main shrine and next to the far end (I missed this both times I came because of lack of time). If you're lucky, you'll get to see an elaborate Japanese wedding or a ritualistic performance of the priests.This opens at dawn (depends on the month) and closes at dusk (also month-dependent) so it offered a lot of flexibility in our itinerary, as many attractions in Japan open around the late morning and close at around 5 - 6pm.Note: Quite a bit of walking with barely any seats! The elder folks in my group tried to rest their feet by sitting on the stone steps but got 'lectured' and chased away instead."

The shingle paths might challenge some, and the smallest of walking children will need a push chair. There is a side garden within the park to the Emperor and Empress' lodge, fishing lake and gardens - a lovely diversion and gives you a feel for their character and love for each other.A great diversion. Walking up Ometesando afterwards gives you a shocking contrast with its great shopping, and the side streets have superb little restaurants and cafes to catch a meal (try Harajuku Gyoza Lou)"

But we had made no plans, so with a little research upon arriving, and having enjoyed the multiple shrines and temples of Kyoto, we decided to dedicate one day to the same in Tokyo. What first drew us to Meiji Temple was... Well, CHOCOLATE. Meiji Chocolate is a) delicious, b) ridiculously cheap and c) not on my diet... Anyway, it was at the Temple we learnt for the \"love, respect and fondness in the warmest heart in all of glorious Japan that the memory of good Emperor Meiji is held\". Well, and we thought he must have made the chocolate... The grounds are just wondrous, veritable forest in the heart of one of the worlds busiest cities, like Hyde or Central Park on other trips, was an absolute treat. Cheerio"

There is a fun little ritual to cleanse yourself, with some water, instructions are in English at the place, then you can enter the actual shrine. It's free, it's interesting, it's a nice break from the skyscrapers and traffic. Worth a look if you have a spare hour in Tokyo. :-)"

It seems the birds of the garden are not afraid to eat out of your hand. The small well at the end of the walk is also a sweet site.The temple itself is a functioning one with wedding ceremonies, men and women in traditional japanese garb, people throwing coings, clapping their hands or washing them at the special pavilions at each entry point.Meiji Jingu is a magnificent place to spend a few hours away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo.

The garden is beautiful and myself and the family had a great time walking around and even spotted some Japanese racoons. The shrine itself is rather beautiful...but if you have seen 20 Japanese shrines, you have seen them all. Overall, we had a great time and it is a great get-away from the madness of Tokyo."

You'll be amazed at just how quiet it is once you enter the grounds... the city just beyond the trees just completely disappears. Go on a Sunday and you will likely see the crazy fashion of the Harajuku kids on your way in and a wedding procession or two in progress inside the shrine. The walk takes a good twenty minutes or so to the inner part of the shrine so plan on at least a couple hours to see everything if you plan to see the gardens and all the grounds. Be sure to grab some street food and head to Yoyogi Park just next door after leaving the shrine to see how locals enjoy a Sunday afternoon. Dog lovers will enjoy the park as well, since this is where Tokyo's dog owners often bring their pets for a play date. Visitors to Tokyo should NOT miss Meiji Jingu."

You can only go so far into the shrine area. There is a tradition of throwing in a few yen and then doing a series of claps and bows at the interior shrine, if you watch people you'll get what you're supposed to do. You can also write prayers or intentions to be read by monks if you're into that. All in all it's a nice walk, interesting artwork, and a cool look at Japanese culture."

If you're going to see one of the Shinto Shrines, I'd recommend Yakusuni Jinga, where there is at least some contemporary controversy to make it more interesting.The map of the surrounding park notes a \"treasure\" exhibit on the northern end, but a walk there revealed nothing but closed buildings, that looked somewhat unkempt.It was extremely hot when I went (early in the morning), and even making every effort to stay in the shade, I was soaked through by the time I left."

This is the first Shinto Shrine that I have visited and I was blown away by how beautiful it was and how relaxing and tranquil it was. The Meiji shrine was established in 1920 and is dedicated to the Emperor Meiji and his Empress who died in the early 20th century. The shrine is surrounded by a forest which was made in honour of the Emperor and Empress by importing 100,000 trees from all over Japan and from overseas.The walk from Harajuku to the entrance to the shrine is about a 10-20 minute walk depending on how fast you walk and whether you stop to look at the beautiful forest, sake/wine barrels/gift shop etc. The path is a gravel path so I would definitely recommend wearing good walking shoes. However, the walk was really very pleasant and as I am living in Tokyo I will definitely go back just to walk around the grounds again.There is a gift shop in the grounds (about halfway between the main entrance at Harajuku and the main shrine) which is worth a look around as they have some great Japanese souvenirs and potential gifts to take home for friends and family. The prices also seemed quite reasonable in Tokyo terms!I was worried that I would not understand the signs and would therefore not be able to show the appropriate level of respect at the shrine (as after all this is a sacred place for many people). However, all of the important signs were also in English and there was a very good explanation of how to wash your hands and mouth at the font before entering the shrine. There were also free english leaflets at the font explaining some of the history of the font, together with the appropriate ettiquette for visiting a shrine which were very handy.Inside the shrine, you can purchase charms for certain things e.g. success in entrance examinations, good health etc. For 500 yen you can also write a prayer out and leave it at the shrine.I would recommend a visit to this shrine to any visitors to Tokyo!"

And what huge is actually the forest area surrounding the shrine, it would take 15 minutes walk to reach the shrine from the main entrance.If you take different exit you'll end up to different train station.With all of its simplicity, it's simply the best shrine in Japan, in my humble opinion."

One immediately senses the mysterious past of Japan. The deep \"quiet\" is overwhelming while the rustle of fast trains in the distance, and occasional freeway traffic noises can still be heard. Tokyo is a mass of steel and concrete, bitumen and glass, trucks and cars and trains, and so much more. And so a nature reserve of this size, in the middle of the metropolis, is a powerful \"symbol\" as well as a practical retreat from city life, for the urban walker."

The shrine is located in the Shibuya area of central Tokyo, about 50 meters from the Harajuku Station on the JR Yamanote line. This year (2012) is the centennial of Emperor Meiji's death so a lot of events are planned for the time period June 30 through July 30. The shrine's grounds are extensive and forested, and contain a huge tori, a museum with personal items of the Emperor and Empress, a lunchroom, and a souvenir shop. The museum was closed the Thursday we visited. The souvenir shop contained more tasteful items than many such shops. We enjoyed walking on the broad carriage paths in this shrine area as a respite from the commotion of Tokyo streets. Posters set up for the centennial celebration contained pictures and prints plus extensive text in Japanese and English about the significance of this emperor. See www.meijijingu.or.jp/english/index.html for more information about this interesting but less well known site."

Other than racing to Meji Shrine, enjoy the walk which would bring calm to anyone overwhelmed by the incredible sights and sounds of Tokyo. It's like a museum with a range of interest points, displays, a pay to enter garden and information. The sight of a tori gate, the trees overhead and a sky scraper in the back drop hit home that traditional and modern Japan coexisting side by side is reality in Tokyo. The japanese notion of balance is evident in the asymetrical design of Meji Jingu, and the grounds are immaculate. Summer means the iris flowers are in full bloom and there were displays by the shrine entrance. Although i saw someone spraying them with water, they were so perfect that i'm still convincing myself they were real!"

They provide a lot of background historical information on the shrine in English and we saw a traditional wedding taking place, which was really very beautiful. I think I enjoyed walking along the trails leading to and from the Meiji Jingu and through Yoyogi Park as much as I enjoyed the shrine itself. The grounds are beautiful and it's hard to believe you're still so close to the city. I would recommend stopping here on a Sunday morning if you're staying in Shibuya - it's an easy and beautiful walk."

I hadn't quite mastered the subway system so I ended up walking waaaay too far- take the JR train to Harajuku Station and you will be right there. The walk into the temple, as others have said, is pretty long- if you have young children, are elderly, or otherwise don't like long walks you may wish to see some of the more accessible shrines in Tokyo. The walk to the shrine is interesting though- huge caskets of sake given as offerings and boards with the story of the Meiji period and the building of the shrine make the long walk more bearable. There is a great gift shop (not crazily overpriced compared to others and has some unique trinkets) and decent restaurant. The grounds of the shrine are peaceful and quiet (not a lot of tourists the day I went). Like other shrines, you can purchase a wooden board to write a message or prayer, as well as purchase other souvenirs. This was not the most impressive shrine I saw in terms of colors, design, and accessibility, but the history and grandeur of the site are definitely worth seeing! For a visually stunning shrine that's a bit more out of the way, look up Nezu Shrine near the Yanaka."

If you are in Tokyo for several days like we were it's great to get away to a quiet wooded area for a bit. There is a lovely pond full of Koi and turtles just a five minute walk from the middle of the shrine area. We didn't go to the museum just past the pond, but hope to on our next trip to Tokyo. Plan on spending an hour or two and take a picinic if the weather allows, as the park by the pond and museum would be a good place for a picinic lunch. We agree with others in the forum that it's fun to be there on a weekend to see a wedding party or two. One of the best things about the visiting shrine is it's free!"

If you are truly interested in this piece of history, read about it. Do not spend your precious vacation minutes here thinking you are soaking up true Japanese culture.Instead, take a walk down Omotesando Dori, about five minutes away by foot. Stroll down as many of the side streets as possible. They are filled with boutiques, galleries, bistros and cool little spaces where the youth of Japan are creating a fashion culture that radiates out to the rest of the world. This is where you can truly soak up an ambience that is quintessentially Japanese.And really, if you've seen one rebuilt Japanese temple, you've seen them all."

There was a huge crowd of Japanese because it is there tradition to go to a shrine on New Year's Day and pray for a good new year. Even though there was a large crowd, the Japanese are very respectful and you still feel you have sufficient personal space. Love the experience!!

Little did we now that it was the place to be. We found ourselves at the beginning of the queue for the inner shrine. Having no idea what was happening we decided to wait. Pretty soon there were loads of people behind us. We were waiting 2 hours before they opened the gates. It was unplanned, but a once in a lifetime opportunity to be the first in and to actually be at the shrine when the drums banged in the new year. When we left we saw that the queue to get in must have had many thousands of people. The police were there in force doing crowd control and the trains ran constantly through the night to cope with the volume of people who were visiting that night.Our previous visit, during the day a few days earlier, was a much calmer affair with no queues at all."

Meiji Jingu Shrine is a famous Shinto shrine built in the 1920s in dedication to the souls of Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, whose physical tombs are in Kyoto. I must say the setting is most peaceful and dignified. I purified at the temizuya and proceeded to reflect at the shrine. People of all faiths -- or no faith at all -- are welcome but it's important to remember this is a holy place and proper etiquette should be observed during one's visit. Photography is permitted only outside.This is a very popular site to visit for Japanese and foreigners alike. There were several traditional Shinto weddings taking place during my visit. And many people from all walks of life came to pay their respects. It was a very positive experience and I felt quite refreshed afterwards. One word of caution: you may not want to visit on or just after New-Year's Day. This is possibly the most popular time for people to visit and you will have to wait in line for a very long time."

A lot of people visit the shrines especially on holidays but if you go during the week one might get a bit more peace and quiet.The shrine is relatively recent have been built to commemorate Emperor Meiji who died in the early 20th Century. It is an excellent example though of Shinto architecture. It is definitely a must-see on any Tokyo itinerary. Within the park there is a small garden, treasure house, and art museum with a small admittance fee. They are worth a look as well.If you are lucky you might catch a traditional Shinto wedding and see the bride and groom in their kimono. On Sundays near the entrance you can see the goth kids in their photogenic outfits.The best time to go to Meiji Shrine is when they have events there:On Jan 6, the Sumo Champion(s) come to Meiji Shrine to perform a ring-entering ceremony around 3pm.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX09ujLk8QcOn the second Monday of January is Seijin-no-Hi which is coming of age day for all those turning 20.

One was processing through the main square and getting pictures taken at the main shrine, and one was posing for pictures behind one of the outer buildings. It all looked very nice, but I felt so sorry for the one doing the procession as a buncha tourists got up close and started snapping like \u2018gee, honey look at these natives; she\u2019s a geee-sha and he\u2019s a samur-hey.\u2019 I assume the other wedding would do the same but later and at a time where there would be even more tourists.

The shrine itself is incredibly beautiful, and the torii that mark the entrance to the shrine are enormous and 1500 years old. We had a relaxing walk through Yoyogi Park."

Until Meiji Restoration this area had been the Daimyo Lord's residence and Kiyomasa's Well may be the only remainder of the Edo era garden. Like other gardens such as Koraku-en and Rikugien it is a typical stroll garden. Lots of wild birds find their home in this garden so if you are a birdwatcher this garden is a perfect place for you."

You start walking into an area that is nicely wooded and gives you the impression that you are walking through some wilderness towards the shrine. The shrine itself was nice and is definitely worth a stop if you have sometime in Tokyo. There were a couple of wedding processions going on, so that was pretty neat to soak in during my time there. It is a nice escape from the busy-ness of this cool city."

The place gives you a different feeling all together. Before u reach the entrance, there will be a tori entrance whereby the wood smells like sandalwood. the whole wood comes from one piece of wood. its amazing how the entrance is made.the temple has some special enegry which keeps you rejuvenated. I must visit.... when you are in tokyo"

If you can visit the Meiji Shrine on a Sunday morning you might get a chance to see a wonderful part of Japanese culture. I went on a Sunday in mid-May and it was alive with activity. There was a tea master\u2019s ceremony going on, along with several traditional Japanese Shinto weddings. With all the excitement going on it is easy to forget you and in downtown Tokyo and not a rural, tree covered village. Even if you can't make it on a Sunday see the shrine that is the most important and beautiful in the City."

Many meticulously groomed plants & trees line the winding walkway to the shrine itself & approaching the building was the most diverse display of chrysanthemums I've seen. I was lucky enough to witness a marriage ceremony & there were children running about in kimonos, contributing to a nearly intoxicating cultural & spiritual experience. The highlight of my visit was seeing the fruit & vegetable offerings from all of the different areas of Japan. My wife was able to locate what I believe were persimmons from her home prefecture of Yamanashi. One tip- when passing through the entry-way of the gate, make sure to step OVER the wooden step in the door frame. Apparently it's bad luck to step ON it."
