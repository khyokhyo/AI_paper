Last year whilst in Dubai we went to the Burj for dinner, this years when visiting we decided to stop at the Berj.We were expecting luxury but we were actually blown away.Amazing suite, staff so well trained.The sun deck had just opened, this addition to the hotel is truly perfect.A great hotel ( you would expect that ) but service and staff were out of this world. Thank you"

We made a reservation a day before, to visit two of the 10 restaurants and bars of the Burj Al ArabThe BAB AL YAM is amazing for a breakfast it has the most amazing view, is an international buffet. The GOLD ON 27 is a bar in the 27 floor you can get a table close to the window and see the whole city, is very private.Be aware that you can only enter to the Burj Al Arab with a restaurant reservation or to have a room reservation.You can not enter with shorts or flip flops.And prepare to be amaze with the structure, the restaurants and the luxury of the hotel."

            "review": "Sail Of A Ship. Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island 280 m (920 ft) from Jumeirah beach and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. The shape of the structure is designed to mimic the sail of a ship. It has a helipad near the roof at a height of 210 m (689 ft) above ground. This extraordinary investment in state-of-the-art construction technology stretches the limits of the ambitious urban imagination in an exercise that is largely due to the power of excessive wealth. Both the hotel and the city, after all, are monuments to the triumph of money over practicality. Both elevate style over substance. Emulating the quality of palatial interiors, in an expression of wealth for the mainstream, a theater of opulence is created in Burj Al Arab \u2026 The result is a baroque effect. The hotel is managed by the Jumeirah Group. Despite its size, Burj Al Arab holds only 28 double-story floors which accommodate 202 bedroom suites. The smallest suite occupies an area of 169 m2 (1,820 sq ft), the largest covers 780 m2 (8,400 sq ft). Suites feature design details that juxtapose east and west. White columns show great influence. Bathrooms are accented by mosaic tile patterns. The Royal Suite, billed at US$24,000 per night, is listed at number 12 on World's 15 most expensive hotel suites compiled by CNN Go in 2012."

We booked for the afternoon tea for our honeymoon and we definitely were not disappointed!First of all just going into the Burj Al Arab is an experience in its self, it's absolutely beautiful inside (I wish we had booked for dinner too now aswell!).It's definitely not cheap, it's probably going to be the most expensive afternoon tea we will ever have but for a special occasion it's definitely worth it.The views from the Sky Lounge (and even the lift!) are brilliant, we were really lucky to have a table by the windows.Our waiter was very attentive and talked us through each course.You have a glass of Champagne to start (you have to pay for more), tea and coffee are unlimited.I had a gluten free afternoon tea and my husband had a normal one.I was a bit worried as to wether I'd be spending all that money for mine to be really different but I have to say everything apart from a few of the cakes were exactly the same which was great. We ended up staying for about 2 and a half hours, the time really did fly. We stayed for a little longer taking pictures of the amazing view too.Overall it's a really good experience and I'd recommend it to anyone going to celebrate an occasion."

There is a welcome drink followed by a multi-course spread.

The rooms were extremely spacious, luxurious, well equipped, nicely designed and some of the best furniture designs. The service was perfect! Staff was unbelievably friendly, and all the facilities were perfect. However, through being so perfect, it gets a touch of not being very cosy and homy, since you will have to adapt to this environment constantly while there, so dressing and behaving appropriately, which is for some people not what they are looking for on vacation, since some people want to relax during that time. But it is definitely one of the best hotels ever."

Full complimentary bar, great 'study'/office. The mirror in the ceiling above the king size bed ensured that my hair style remained perfect the entire night. The upstairs bathroom with sunken tub and a full top of the range perfume each day was unbelievable. Look the hotel is gaudy and over the top in typical UAE style but if u are looking for something really different this is it!"

The bar is great and has a good buzz.The restaurant food and service was more 3 star than the supposed 7!We were brought to our table from the bar and had to wait for over 10 + minutes for any one to come and take a drinks order. The wine took a further 20 minutes to arrive and we had both finished our starters. I as told that they had run out of the wine in their restaurant store and had to go elsewhere to get a bottle. The menu was limited in choice but had some interesting dishes. I chose Alaskan crab for my appetiser and a veal dish with sweetbreads and pate de foi gras. The appetiser was just three mouthfuls and totally tasteless. If I was doing a blind tasting I would have had no awareness of what I was eating. My wife had pate de foi gras and it was acceptable but nothing like the taste and quality of the STAY restaurant in the One&Only Palm hotel.When the waitress came to take my plate she asked if all was OK (nobody has asked whilst i was eating) I said that the meal was tasteless and asked this to be made know to the kitchen. No one came to discuss with me and the service from then on was decidedly cool. My main course of veal was dry and if there were sweetbreads and pate with the dish I did not recognise of taste them. Again i said I was very disappointed and again nobody cam to discuss this with me.We did not order dessert but the restaurant, who had been advised of my wife's birthday,' did present her with a nice cake which ws a nice touch but by then we just wanted to leave as our expectations had been so much higher.The cost, including two cocktails and a modest bottle of wine came to a \u00a3597.00 which, considering the poor quality of the food and service, was excessive.Need less to say we won't be returning and I think that is why the service is so poor. As so many visitors who come to Dubai want to visit and try this iconic hotel, they can behave like this as most people will only go once anyway.My advice is OK, go to the bar and enjoy the view and the opulence of the hotels interior but not having a meal and save your money to go elsewhere."

Visitors can't simply enter the hotel without an booking. If one lands up without a booking, from the security gate one has to make a reservation for the lounge, which has a cover charge that comes to about USD 100. Within this amount, one can order whatever snacks or drinks one wants at the lounge. Expensive, yes, but it's worth the experience to see the loud, colouful, opulent interior. The hotel also has a helipad at the top and an underwater restaurant but those are only accessible to hotel guests."

The food was amazing and we were stuffed, we couldn't eat all the cakes provided in the end. Tea and coffee were plentiful, and there was a huge range to choose from. They were all included and kept coming! We were served a glass of champagne to start, followed by a parfait, a tart, a sorbet, then a huge tray of sandwiches, then a huge tray of cakes! Everything was amazing. The staff were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. I would recommend going early to have a look round the lobby area which is stunning. The time we went was great because it allowed us to see the sun setting, and it was no problem for us to stay for a cocktail so we were there into the early evening. The cocktails were also fabulous! The staff encouraged you to take photos, and even took some for us. We truly felt special, what a wonderful afternoon and evening, I never wanted it to end! Thank you so much!"

To drive across the bridge you have to show your reservation details.Don't attempt to cross unless you have a reservation as there is a boom gate.The building with it's beautiful Italian tiled floors, Persian carpets , fountains and fish tanks is truly breathtaking. There is a wait after you check in as they assemble people booked for the 4 pm afternoon tea session. This is very boring as the heat coming through the glass is very intense and the air conditioning cannot cope. You then go into the lift in small groups up to the restaurant.Everything is six star service. the wait staff, food , drinks as well as the stunning view. it is a wonderful experience indeed. I have no idea what it costs as I was a guest, but I'm sure it's extremely expensive.The only criticism I have is the boring wait for the lift as we had arrived on time. perhaps they had a problem and didn't want people in the restaurant, but it seemed very odd."

We visited here for afternoon tea as a birthday treat for me and also it's the only 7* hotel in the world!!It is expensive \u00a3250 for us both so no cheap meal! We arrived at the Burj by a free buggy from our hotel which was Jumeriah Beach hotel. You drive up to the entrance and are stopped to confirm why you are visiting so just make sure you have your booking to hand. Then you are greeted as soon as you walk in the door and directed where to go. In the entrance there are amazing water features so make sure you have time to stand and water the show. When you are waiting to go up to the sky bar you are stood waiting with everyone else that is having afternoon tea, you do feel a little like you are the poor relations as you aren't allowed to go elsewhere apart from that area.We were really lucky and had seats by the window which was awesome and a stunning view, we had a 4pm seating and would so recommend it as the sun setting is beautiful. We had champagne and I had a none alcoholic version which had 24c gold in it which was like an apple flavoured drink, very nice. Just be aware you have one glass free of them then you pay but you have unlimited tea and soft drinks. The meal was 7 courses and everyone gets it at the same time. We had a white chocolate mouse which was Devine followed by a ratatouille puffy pastry parcel, followed by sandwiches then sorbet, pastries and scones they where all AMAZING stunning food! The only down thing was I have a server allergy to raspberries and they left the cake with them on the plate so meant I couldn't eat most of them sadly.They did give me a rose and a cake for my birthday which was so lovely.Dress code my husband wore chinos, a Hugo boss polo top and boat shoes as its so hot heading there and he was probably one of the smartest so just in case you where struggling with a men's outfit.Enjoy every mouthful!!!"

We will truly remember this experience for the rest of our life and was the highlight of our 4 days in Dubai.My traveller tips would be to get there bang on time as they seat you right to left along the room and the tables to the far right afford the best view of Jumeirah to downtown Dubai. My other tip would be to dress smartly, a collared shirt and trousers with closed shoes is suitable for gents.You may think this experience is a bit pricey but it is truly worth it, it is a must visit whilst in Dubai!"

The hotel itself is still amazing although it's 17 years since it first opened.

If you are wise book the last sitting. You are not in any rush to leave and you can watch the amazing sunset. Well worth the visit."

Our waitress Katriana (i think) was pleasant and ran through everything for us keeping us topped up with drinks also. I had emailed in advance to inform them of my partners Birthday. A chocolate cake and a rose were provided which was a nice touch my partner enjoyed. Katriana also managed to get us a tour of the hotel for my partners birthday which was very nice of her.We were shown the Spa, Gym, Library, Games room, Sky Restaurants and also a trip in the Glass elavator which offered great views. We were also told to have a walk round the new terrace area with infinity pool.Overall experience was great and price was not too bad to say you eaten in a 7* hotel.Couldn't thank Katriana enough from Sahn Eddar Lounge for everything she really made our day hopefully this gets passed on to her."

There is a bar (Gold on 27) where you can reserve a time and then turn up and pay for your drinks as you go, or you have the options of reserving a table in the SkyView bar where there is a minimum spend. I done both while I was here and in my opinion, everything about the Gold on 27 bar was far superior, so in my opinion, I would definitely recommend having a drink here if you are looking to see the Burj Al Arab."

Absolutely not, it's a once in a lifetime and it helps you better understand those whose vast fortunes mean they have no concept of either money or taste. Everything is tuned up to 11 on the scale and everything that glitters in here probably is gold.We had drinks and snacks in the Skyview Bar. Excellent service as you would expect, although the credit card machine wasn't processing Barclaycard so I was one of many who had to go through the very embarrassing ride down to the hotel lobby to withdraw the funds in cash.Would I ever stay here? Absolutely not. A five star hotel is top rated for a reason, anything beyond that is just unnecessary. Do it, tick it off the bucket list and realise you're better off not having the kind of money that means you feel the need to come here and make sure every social media app tells your \"friends\" that's where you are... ;0)"

Waiting in the car between a construction, cause the half of bridge is surrounded of a conatruction. When you go into the lobby, you see a good fountain between two mechanic steps. There are not less glamorous than two mechanich steps, one going up and the other going down. The lobby has two levels, high and down. In the high level there are another nice fountain and small space. All the floors are comunicated in this level of lobby. The decoration of this part is not very elegant it is a bit nagg like the decorator was a nagpie, golden, golden everywhere, shops, columns, chairs. After checking they go with you to the suit, that is the best part of the hotel. Really good and confortable. Service is kindly and professional. But price is not according to the services. There are not large and elegant saloons full of chinesse people. Certanly this is the best option if you are chinesse, not for western, Park Hyatt or Al Qasr Hotel are more adecuated.

Afternoon tea for four of us was as you would expect in this seven star hotel; absolutely fabulous from beginning to end. From the moment you are greeted by security before crossing the causeway to the hotel, to the amazing decoration, luxury and hospitality second to none, it's difficult to fault the 'experience' as that's what any part of a visit to this hotel is.The staff were faultless and absolutely nothing was too much trouble. The range of teas and sandwiches available were excellent and despite the considerable price you really do feel like you are getting value for money which is all that's important in my view."

We were met outside the lift and taken to our table overlooking the Jumeira Beach Hotel and harbour. It was beautiful. Our 'tea' was explained to us at every stage by the wonderfully attentive staff and came served on tiered stands in the shape of the 'sail'. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented.

Ahh the Burj Al Arab\u2026\u2026the very thought of it denotes sheer luxury and expense; a one-in-a-lifetime, \u2018must do\u2019 in Dubai. Love the fact you cannot access the island unless a reservation has been placed. Loved the fact that this is architecture and engineering combined together in what I consider one of the most iconic buildings ever constructed. The entrance and lobby leads you onto the promise that with every step, you are captivated to another place. There is no comparison; there is nothing else like it. There are dancing fountains, golden gilded columns with colourful lights\u2026.every aspect is in full colour, it\u2019s vibrant and yet oddly serene. My husband booked the Al Muntaha restaurant on the 27th Floor for our wedding anniversary and since we had moved to Dubai in April, it only seemed fitting that this is where we would have our anniversary here. We arrived at 6:45pm and as we waited for quite some time outside the restaurant lobby / waiting area, another gentleman began to complain to one of the staff as it was quite evident she was a bit flustered and in need of some assistance. They too had been waiting for some time, as we all were. In fact, she openly called out for another member of staff to come to her as she frantically looked at the monitor. We didn\u2019t mind, we figured, they will call us when they are ready, no point adding to her anxiety!Eventually she came to us and whispered \u2018sorry\u2019 and brought into the bar area. My husband and I ordered drinks and even though we had dinner booked for 7:00pm, it was now 7:30pm when a female member of staff came to our table and sternly \u2018reminded\u2019 us we had dinner reservations in the restaurant. We felt like scolded children; in the wrong place at the wrong time. We told her that we knew what time our dinner reservation was but that we were seated in the bar by her colleague earlier. You cannot simply walk into the bar, a member of staff escorts you in. I explained that it was our first time in Burj Al Arab and we just (quite stupidly I admit) thought that the Burj Al Arab served an aperitif before dinner, as part of the overall dining experience. We genuinely didn\u2019t know and felt clumsy even though it wasn\u2019t our mistake. Instead of just letting us enjoy our drinks, she asked that we go the restaurant (as in right away) and our drinks would be brought to the restaurant (and subsequently added to the bill). Then I just felt embarrassed as the people on the adjacent table looked at us as we were being asked to leave\u2026.well, it felt like I was evicted from the party I wasn\u2019t invited to. As we walked, shamefully from the bar, I mentioned to the female staff member that I thought it was odd we were brought into a bar when my husband does not even drink alcohol at all. Instead she remarked along the lines of \u2018tell me your secret I can\u2019t staff away from the stuff.\u2019 We cringed and walked on, not the response I was hoping for from a 7 star place. And so we went to the restaurant, were given a wine menu and asked what we would like to drink. I then had to explain that our drinks were coming from the bar area. That said, we made the most of our night as we understand sometimes people get things wrong. The food selection was so perfected with a wonderful array of choices, especially food sourced from our native Ireland (so well done for that!). The evening was topped off with a delightful chocolate dessert they made for us and being presented with a single red rose. The hotel management did contact my husband via email as they do with whoever placed the reservation and we did note what happened. The hotel did respond by way of an apology and noted they would look into it.I would still rate this as 'Excellent' because it is, irrespective of what happened. "

A bit of a foodie our gift to him was a culinary flight in this legendary hotel.Starting with the journey across the pontoon into the private island we were treated like royalty. A team of doormen synchronised the opening of the car doors for us and instantly made us feel valued and welcomed. The lobby of the hotel is breathtaking, containing an aquarium and an unrestricted view from the atrium of all the guest floors and suites. Our journey began at the rear of the hotel at the glass elevator. This took us to the top floor where we were greeted by name by our host. We were escorted to our table in the sky bar and our son was asked to confirm that he is 21 - by law nobody under 21 can enter a bar in Dubai. We explained about this being his 21st treat and from thereon everybody we spoke to wished him a happy birthday!!We were delighted with our table: overlooking the beaches and city skyline as the sun set. The culinary flight offers 4 courses with matched wines each taken in a different restaurant so whilst enjoying the food diners get to explore this hotel.We were given a menu booklet and had to choose our dishes and wines 'up front' : we all elected for the Mr Big cocktails which were served with a range of delicious canap\u00e9s, flavoured cashews and stuffed olives. We were not rushed at all and were encouraged to stay as long as we wanted.For our first course we were escorted to the dining room on the opposite side of the building so that we were looking out over the Palm. A lovely environment apart from a very loud British teen who was busy informing the waiter he wanted a 'kids burger'.In every restaurant we were served an amuse bouche and in this restaurant it was Parmesan choux buns which were as light as air and delicious. Two of us then enjoyed King Crab with delicate swirls of complementary garnishes whilst the other was served a generous portion of foie gras all washed down with champagne.The second course was served in the Arabian restaurant. The decor was rich and vibrant in complete contrast to the contemporary feel of the previous locations. Jordan was greeted with a Happy Birthday and we were seated in a convenient location to be be able to watch the hustle and bustle.! Dishes served here included king prawns with scallops, morrocan lamb soup and roasted turbot, all of us opting for the extremely nice Chablis. The canap\u00e9 in this restaurant was delicious, being a mix of tasty warm breads with various traditional dips. The food was extremely good quality, well presented and deserving of a Michelin star. The third course, billed as the main, was taken in the Asian restaurant which is very modern and seems to operate as both a buffet and al a carte dining option. The food, wagyu beef all round, was perfect but the restaurant lacked atmosphere. We were the only diners and it felt quite cold and limp after the splendour of the previous two. However, the staff were very friendly and the service was faultless.Last but not least we were served out of this world desserts in the fourth and final restaurant in the atrium. There was theatre, there was chocolate, oohs and aahs and food too gorgeous to eat, but, you know, we forced ourselves!Just when we thought the evening had come to an end, the staff then arrived with an opera cake adorned with candles and singing happy birthday! We needed little encouragement to devour some additional cake with the rest being boxed up for us to take home with us. We left with the cake, a bouquet of beautiful roses and a souvenir wallet containing embossed menu cards of our meal choices.Not a cheap night out by any stretch but well worth every penny and something we will always remember!!"

We were 8 people, and we had a round table just at the corner with stunning views! We chose a 3 courses menu @ 595 AED (143\u20ac) per person with drinks not included. It was really good. You enter the hotel and you are impressed with the decoration. You have someone very kind taking you to the restaurant reception and you take a transparent lift with sea views. They were waiting for us and said congratulations for our aniversary:-). We were sit at the table and Lorna, our assistant was really good, kind and professional. The sumiller was also very good and helpful. I chose terrine de foie, sea bass and a hazelnut dessert, everything really tasty and good, presentation of the plates was also great. At the end we were given a cake and I was given a rose! All of us really enjoyed and the experience was really worth!"

Top marque continental luxury cars are just too common in this hotel. To stay here for a night is just like installing a bomb into a my personal bank vault. Security is very tight. For the public, it could be accessed for a fee coupled with a free drink. Located next to a water theme park."

            "review": "Feng shui of Burj al Arab. I thought I would add this review to trip advisor for those of you after a slightly different perspective on the hotel.In September 2009, I was fortunate enough to be a guest at Burj Al Arab\u2019. Since its construction began in 1994 this hotel has had more press than any other hotel in the world. It forms an integral part of Dubai\u2019s skyline and is regarded as an iconic symbol of the country\u2019s urban transformation.I was eager to see what the feng shui of this much talked about building would be like. So armed with my lopan, I decided to take some calculations and understand the form of this striking building.Some facts & calculations:\u00fc It stands at 321 metres high and is the worlds 2nd tallest hotel. (321 is of course 123 backwards).\u00fc The hotel stands on an artificial island 280 metres out from Jumeriah beach.\u00fc Inside the building the atrium is 280 m tall.\u00fc It accommodates 202 bedroom suites.\u00fc The cost of staying in a suite begins at US$2,000 per night; the Royal Suite is the most expensive, at US$28,000 per night. (Of course these fluctuate but these are the printed prices at the time of writing the article.)\u00fc Kwa calculations 8/8 & 8/2If you are a feng shui consultant do you see what I\u2019m seeing with the numbers? So many 8\u2019s & 2\u2019s. (For this fate period the numbers 8&2 are very auspicious) Surely a recipe for success! But are the calculations the only reason for its phenomenal success? I don\u2019t think so.The hotel is connected to the mainland via a purpose-built gently meandering bridge.As our car drew close to the hotel I was amazed at its wonderful form, which seemed to sit so perfectly in its surroundings.The building is an amazing structure, mimicking the sail of a \u2018dhow\u2019 an Arabian vessel. Two \u201cwings\u201d spread in a V to form a vast \u201cmast\u201d, while the space between them is enclosed in a massive atrium.Outside the grand main entrance is a stunning water fountain in a \u2018goy moon\u2019 (health & wealth) shape. The kwa for the main entrance and fountain is 8/2 in the southeast. (Water in the southeast is very auspicious)As we were escorted into the lobby, we felt the temperature suddenly cooling us, whilst outside the sun was scorching down.We were greeted by an uplifting fragrance, our eyes feasted on hundreds of fresh flowers \u2013 all arranged exquisitely, a striking dancing water feature and two huge aquariums also graced the lobby.Staff stood politely holding fresh towels, large dates and pouring tea as guests sat down \u2013 every guest was treated like royalty. As soon as you entered it seemed as if you were the only guest there because all the staff knew your name.However, is the fantastic hospitality and the lavish interiors, made of precious materials including 22 carat gold leaf, enough to make this hotel the most talked about, hugely successful and most unique hotel in the world?I don\u2019t believe it is the only reason.So why has this building become such an iconic symbol and why is this hotel almost always fully occupied, despite it being so expensive? Well I think a huge part of the answer lies in the words of the architect Tom Wright, \u2018we looked at the other buildings in the world that are symbols to see what they had in common. We found that they were all totally unique in shape and they all have a simple easily recognizable form. We decided that the test to determine if a building is symbolic is if you can draw it in 5 seconds and every one recognizes it.\u2019Well that makes complete sense in feng shui terms; it is a simple form that fits perfectly in its environment; a boat in the sea, it is easily recognizable, is different from all the other buildings. It is also one of the tallest buildings in the world, in a space where most of the land is flat, so obviously it attracts the chi. Apart from all this, Dubai is so hot and dry most of the year and is largely a desert, and of course in a desert, water is the life force.Site and facing \u2013 for a boat that is floating in the sea with water 360 degrees around, are the site and facing calculations as relevant in comparison to a property built on solid land? I don\u2019t think so \u2013 the main entrance is at 8/2, which is perfect but the site and facing are really not all that relevant at all since water is surrounding the whole structure. The main entrance which faces the land may at first seem like the facing but it is not really the facing at all, since all the bedrooms have views to the sea. Thus, the opposite side, the rear is more like the facing.My Verdict \u2013 In my view the reason for its success is a combination of all three factors, excellent hospitality, the calculations; the hotel is built largely in the 8 fate and is built on 8/8 and 8/2 kwas, with 8/2 being the main entrance, as well as having so many other 8\u2019s & 2\u2019s everywhere. However, the most vital factor for its success in my view is its form and setting, water is all around it, it is a boat/sail in the sea. Tom Wright the architect said, \u2018if it were built on the shore it would have blocked the light\u2019. Thank God it wasn\u2019t built on the shore, because in my opinion one of the main reasons it is so successful is its appeal of floating in the water \u2013 surely a boat/ship out of the water cannot fulfill its function!"

Butler service, incredibly friendly and polite staff, amazing views over Dubai and an indoor pool about 25 floors up overlooking the city - this really is an unforgettable experience. The apartment (can't really call it a room) is simply huge and spread over two floors with overstuffed furniture and a bathroom bigger than some apartments I've been in. Rich (or gaudy depending on your taste) colours throughout the suite and a bed the size of an aircraft carrier ensure that your stay is one of pure luxury. Get a golf buggy to the private beach where you can enjoy some peaceful sun or make use of the sister hotel's more lively facilities if you wish. If you've got the money you've got to do it....just once!"

The food was great and filling too, waiters were very nice. Another highlight was the sparkling apple cider that had edible 24k gold flakes. Overall an experience you should not miss out on when visiting Dubai."

I feel the pride one does of their hometown when I here pleasant comments about the hotel. Usually with the mere mentioning of the hotel's name, one conjectures an image of the quintessence of luxurious accommodation. Unfortunately this has not been true of the Burj al Arab for the past few years. An outdated and small swimming pool, a school canteen style breakfast buffet and a makeshift beach precluded the Burj al Arab from its former hegemony in the hoteling world. In the past year I have been travelling a lot in the U.S and Europe. Unfortunately I have been saddened to see hotels from Berlin in Central Europe to hotels in Los Angeles on the western coast of America surmount the standards set by the Burj al Arab.After some extensive redevelopment and extension I can now say I am again proud to have been able to stay at such a wonderful hotel. The Burj al Arab is again in my opinion the best hotel in the world: certainly the best I have ever stayed at. The issues were clear and beget simple solutions: new pool, better beach, nicer breakfast area. To my surprise, these issues were not addressed superficially like most hotels would. Instead the Burj al Arab, has reinvented itself in its most radical change since its opening. The corollary of this is an awe-inspiring huge extension. Every detail has been maliciously pondered over. What the Burj al Arab call daytime cabanas, hotels in the Maldives call suites. What many hotels call large infinity pools the Burj al Arab calls jacuzzis. The scale and scope of the island really must be seen in person. It's impossible to compliment the design team in words. A fantastic new breakfast outlet completes the panoply of luxury living.A hotel that transcends luxury, lost its way for a couple of years, although nobody could make the same claim now. The Burj al Arab is again a model of excellence."

The views are breathtaking and it was a highlight of Dubai for me, despite visiting Dubai 4 times in the last year. You really can't get better than this. It is honestly who you would expect the rich and famous to live. The decoration around the hotel is unbelievable. I found myself taking pictures of everything! From the restaurants, to the food! Yes, it is a very expensive hotel, but it is truly an unforgettable experience. The staff were amazing (as you'd expect) and so was the food. I recommend entirely.

Access to the Hotel is only permitted with a Reservation...it does not have to be Dinner at Al Muntaha (The Ultimate), but why settle for Ground Floor eateries when the 27th Floor delivers jaw dropping views and Service.On arrival you enter the copious interior opens up to compete opulence. The dancing Fountains are mesmerising which leads you past the Escalator lined with huge Aquariums to the knee deep carpets of the Ground Floor Atrium. Walk, or more like wade, though to the Lift Lobby to be greeted by the 'Keeper of the Elevator' You will only be able to enter to travel to the 27th Floor IF you have a Reservation. Travel to the 27th Floor to be again greeted with humility as you exit the Elevator. Take time before Dinner to visit the Skyview Bar, not just for the Drinks but for the Views of a growing Dubai.At every stage of Dinner, the Service was beyond Exceptional and the Food keeps up the Impeccable Quality.If your Business is listed on the Stock Exchange, you win the Lottery, decide to re-Mortgage the House or just have some spare Holiday Cash, then when you visit Dubai you cannot leave without experiencing what is \"SIMPLY THE BEST...!!!\""

There are no single rooms, only two level suits with a sweeping staircase. Of course you have you own butler who will record your every move in order to give you better service; from the time you get up, to what newspaper you read and what coffee or Tea you prefer? The invite to the managers reception party on the terrace of the 20th floor was surreal. There was a woman with a striking resemblance to Mary Antoinette, dressed in a full length ball gown standing in the middle of a table and moving around serving Sushi off of her dress. The complimentary champagne just kept flowing. Everything about the Burj Al Arab is 1st class. They even give you the whole range of Hermes for Men and also for Women as a gift in your bathrooms.

Needless to say that a room was outside of my budget so decided to do afternoon tea at the Skyview bar. Booked a couple of days in advance by email for a 13.00 date with tea and scones.The \u2018welcome\u2019 gate checks to see if you have a booking, access to the hotel is for those on the list only and there were lots of people hanging around at the gates for photo opportunities go the hotel behind them.Arrived early as all reviewers have advised you to do so got to take a look round the entrance lobby and atrium. Its really a marvel of engineering. The toilets are also fab, you get a feel for any place by its toilets. The glass fronted elevator whisks you up to the 27th floor and the views are amazing.Not may people were taking afternoon tea the day I booked so I was treated to a magnificent window table and fussed over by the staff who were wonderful (as expected) Tea was fantastic, all courses well presented and delicious. Far too much for one so had to take home a doggy bag.Its pricey, but worth it. If you are treating someone or celebrating a special occasion its the place to be. If I had bottomless pockets, I would return and do it all over again."

She went out of her way to escort us up to the bars and give us a tour of the Skyview Lounge, even though she doesn't manage that part of the Burj. Agnese also took the time out to give us informative information about the Burj and its various eateries, it made our visit much more memorable. A 'must-do' when in town!"

It;s definitely unique and magnificent for some, but I felt it was over hyped and really missed the warm ambience of Arabian style hospitality. It's almost like they found the most unique idea they could, and said were having it!

This iconic 7-star hotel has long been seen to most as the \"too exclusive or not easily accessible\" for the norm. Most people settles with adoration and long gaze from the outside only. It must be one of the most photographed building in the world. Wouldn't it be great if it was more accessible to the general public and one could say...\"I've been inside and saw\"? The good news is that it is now possible and a lot more accessible for all. I recently visited the Burj Al Arab with visitors from out of town and we booked in their newest addition \"Gold on 27th\". This stunning, state-of-the-art exclusive lounge allows you to book and come for a drink without a minimum spent. You could visit and have one drink only if this is what your budget allows (starting at 100AED approximately) although we can all agree that this is extremely reasonable considering that it gives you access to one of the most prestigious building in the world!"

Burj Al Arab is one of the most beautiful hotels in Dubai and I could not agree more to this compliment. The form of this hotel is a big beautiful sailing boat, actually it is located on a man made island and it was opened in 1999 with only 202 rooms. All of them are suits. I visited one of the suits and I have to say that it is so so beautifully decorated in every detail. Every suit has sea view. In fact, every room has the sea view. There are several restaurants, bars and coffee shops, and swimming pools. I can not believe my eyes when I see the view from the hotel rooms. I had coffee in the coffee shop and my coffee had grinned gold leave in it! This is definitely a seven star hotel.

It was a confusing and somewhat disjointed dinner event as we pre-chose our courses and then went from restaurant to restaurant to dine. While I enjoyed seeing the differences in the restaurants, not every course was outstanding nor the service impeccable. The dessert of apple tatin was superb as was my foie gras. The remainder of the meal was just average. For the wine pairing, I felt the choices were rather ordinary. For the price, I would struggle to recommend to others. It has such promise if done with a personal concierge who escorts you throughout the experience from restaurant to restaurant and ensures things are perfect. My guess is they don't do it very frequently so all the kinks aren't worked out."

You have to experience the high tea not the one on the ground level but up in the sky. Food and plenty of it delicious. The plates or I should say the glass plates and the patterns/shapes were art in themselves. IT is something I will never forget they made it special and nothing was a problem. They asked if we were celebrating anything special, I told them we had an anniversary whilst in Dubai and before we left they present us with a long stem rose and a cake especially for our occasion. People say it is expensive I suppose it was, I paid for it in Australia before I left and I can say it was worth every cent. The view along is incredible. Just came back from Dubai this June 2016 and stayed at The Palms Atlantis Dubai, thoroughly enjoyed that also."

You can't come to Dubai and not see this world famous landmark.However, if you're not planning to eat or stay here, make sure to plan wisely because it is technically in the middle of nowhere (at least attraction wise).There is a beach nearby where you can get some nice photos, but I'd recommend if you're planning on doing some day tours, pick one where they include taking you here to avoid being left wandering around in the heat looking for a taxi.Also, it looks a lot smaller in real life than we expected."

With a booking, you are allowed entry to the hotel so we arrived in time to have a look round the lobby etc before our reservation. At first we were seated in the centre of the bar, however once a couple had vacated one of the window tables our waiter ensured that we were moved swiftly to enjoy the amazing view over Dubai at night. The drinks were superb - great selection of wines and cocktails. Nibbles are also provided and replenished regularly - we were provided with so much food that we ended up not needing any dinner. The whole bar has an air of luxury about it that is characteristic of Dubai and the Burj Al Arab. We would definitely recommend this as an experience not to miss whilst in Dubai, it was definitely ones of the highlights of my 3 month stay there!"

For a 7* hotel this is a total disappointment.. We didn't even have a view from our seat either, even tho when we arrived there was better seats available!My main was not great atall, just a piece of sea bream surrounded by basic vegetable mix.. Was nothing special atall..Also felt very rush from start to finish Always someone waiter behind you looking to see if you was finished. Four times we got ask if we wanted wine, even tho we are not wine drinkers And already had two drinks each on the table already! When i went to the toilet I was followed by one of the waitresses even tho she told me where the toilets was, this experience was not nice atall and if I already haven't paid the meal via another party I would 100% refused to not pay considering it was \u00a3140pp I wouldn't of even payed \u00a360 for this..

Having been a doorstep sandwich and mug of tea bloke all my life, I felt like Gulliver being invited to a Lilliputian tea party. The greeting of a glass of champagne lulled me into believing this experience was going to be normal. However, it all went surreal. This hotel is luxurious and you need to go through a checkpoint just to make sure you were actually booked in. Then there's the beautiful women and ornately gold decor.

If you want to see this off the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus be prepared for a long walk in the hot weather. As construction is still happening around the Burj Al Arab the views even from outside are limited. We did not fly around Dubai to see this building but I assume this service exists and it might be the best way to see the outside of the building"

            "review": "Worst so called 7 star experience ecer. We wanted to go to the Burj for sometime and as it was our anniversary we decided to treat ourselves to their Friday brunch. We were going with our 8 month baby so asked our hotel to call in advance and arrange for them to make some baby food for our daughter a recipe was also provided so as not to get it wrongWhen you arrive it is stunning and the lift to the sky restaurant is spectacular a must see in itself. However when we arrived the reception area started to fill up quite quickly we were left waiting for our table for about 15 minutes and were seated late with no apology of explanation We were seated at a lovely table, I requested the babies food which they said was ready. When the brought it it was mash potato laden with cream, I asked them had the not received the recipe and was greeted with an appalling attitude from and member of staff. The manager came over to apologise and said she would fix it. I relayed the recipe and hoped they would finally get it right. In the mean time we were served a glass of prosecco you pay \u00a3125 each for the brunch and get one free glass and it's not even champagne. Very disappointing In the meantime my daughter had fallen asleep waiting for her food, we were at the stage thinking of just leaving as we were so unimpressed and wasn't willing to spend \u00a3250 for the experience, however the manager asked us to stay so they could make it right. When my daughter woke I asked for her food. This arrived and looked super creamy I asked the waitress to find out what was in it and if it had been made with cream, she returned to say it had. I couldn't believe it I know this may sound pedantic however she is 8 months and does not have the tolerance for this type of food. I asked for chicken, carrots and potatoes to be cooked and mashed so not especially hard. We had run out of pre bought baby food so was relying on the hotel to make food for us. I got quite upset as this could have really made my daughter sick. I sent it back and we decided enough was enough and we were leaving. The chef came out with bowls of food at this point and aggressively put them on our table and shouted you did not request dairy free. Sorry I didn't realise I had to tell a chef from a 7 staff hotel not to put cream in an 8 month old babies food. The actual food at the brunch is OK not great and because of all the issues with the baby food we didn't get to eat much. The manager took my husband to the side and told him that we would no be paying for the brunch dud to everything that had happened. We accepted this and thanked her. She also gave my daughter a teddy me some flowers and a cake for our anniversary, we then left. Whilst waiting for a taxi in the lobby we were approached by a waiter from the restaurant telling us we had not paid for our bottle of wine we were shocked and embarrassed as ww were told we didn't have to. The manager came down we tried to return her gifts and told her we were appalled as she had said it was on her and there were no stipulations around the alcohol etc. We tried to pay for the wine but she now decided that this was ok and would not accept the payment. Totally embarrassing. It was an absolute disaster from beginning to end and topped off what had already been an awful holiday. Such a shame as we were so looking forward to the experience"

            "review": "Worth Every Single Dirham!. Ten years ago I passed through Dubai on my way to Afghanistan and met a young family that stayed one night in the Burj Al Arab. Of course, when told the cost for a night (about a mortgage payment), I thought to myself, who in their right mind would ever would pay that much for a hotel stay? Seems like ten years can change one\u2019s mind, because now I fully understand why. We booked a one-night stay under the UAE residence rate, which included breakfast; discount vouchers for the spa (we didn\u2019t use); access to Wild Wadi (we\u2019ll go another time); in-room cocktails and canap\u00e9s; and full-size Herm\u00e8s toiletries for him and for her. This was in celebration of our wedding anniversary.Check in was not until 3:00 PM, so we decided to grab lunch at the nearby Mina A\u2019 Salam hotel in the Souk Madinat Jumeirah. At 1:10 PM I called to see if our room was available and was told to come to the hotel and use the facilities if not. We made our way to the hotel, note that access to the property is only if you have restaurant or hotel reservations, and were greeted at the door by a bellman and our greeter who escorted us to our room. On the way up, she explained that check in was taken care of in the room (!). Our room was 1103 and faced the north end of Dubai toward the Burj Khalifa. As the rooms are duplex floors, it really meant the 22nd floor. We were greeted by the butlers at the concierge desk on our floor and shown to our room. It made an impression with the door open and the view to the sweeping staircase leading up to the bedroom. Soon after we entered our welcome drink arrived, our greeter left and our butler Cyra arrived, who proceeded to complete our check in process. She gave us a tour of the room, asked if we wanted her to unpack our things, (nope) and left us to continue our stay. By this time, it was roughly 2:20PM and we opted to make our way to the new terrace pool extension. What a delight. Two pools, one fresh water, one salt water. We made a beeline for the salt-water infinity pool at the end of the extension. It\u2019s surrounded by the private cabanas and in the front are chaise lounge chairs and round sun beds in a sandy \u2018beach\u2019. A beach assistant found us a bed, lined it with towels, and promptly brought over a cooler with water, cold towels, and face spray. It was replenished throughout our visit.We stayed at the pool all afternoon until about 6:00 PM with a stop at the swim up pool bar around 4ish. Our bartender Mahmoud Harris was a star. He convinced me to try a Green Monk (!!) and made great conversation; this, despite the fact that he was fasting for Ramadan, had the best attitude. We also met Paul, an equally charming staff member from Sri Lanka. We left the pool with grand plans to catch the sunset at the Sky View bar, which we were told required reservations and, blah, blah, blah. Not in the mood to make a huge effort, we decided we\u2019ve seen plenty of sunsets and would enjoy the room instead. Our evening butler (didn\u2019t catch his name) soon arrived with cocktails and canap\u00e9s. He even returned for a second round. There was a nice box of baklava in a Burj Al Arab signature shaped box (delish). We considered our dining options and took a look at the Private Dining menu and decided to order in. I ordered the organic greens and gnocchi with Arrabiata sauce while my husband ordered the lobster Caesar salad. Sadly, what arrived was a lobster salad with mango (his one allergy). Not sure if the communication failure was on our end or their end, but no matter, the intended salad arrived after a quick phone call and we were stuffed! The bill was a very reasonable 420 Aed. Granted, we didn\u2019t have any alcohol, but by Dubai standards, that was an inexpensive meal. As a comparison, lunch at Tortugas (a Mexican restaurant) was 270 Aed. We had asked the butler, Kelly, to prepare our Jacuzzi bath at 8:30 and decided to move it up to 8:00 PM \u2013 we were wiped out from a day in the saltwater pool. Soon after, we checked out the Hermes toiletries.We turned in early and found turn down service with bespoke Patchi chocolates in the shape of the hotel and a single red rose on either side of the bed. We were fast asleep in the comfiest of beds by 9:00 (complete with over head mirror). Note you are able to select your optimal pillow from the Pillow Menu! One might find an over the bed mirror cheap a la Vegas or the Poconos, but it was actually a bit fun. At 9:30 our evening butler called to say they had an anniversary surprise for us. With my slumbering spouse at my side, I declined until the morning. Breakfast was in Bab Al Yam located poolside by the original hotel pool, which is shockingly small. We started breakfast outside and moved inside as the temperature became warmer. The buffet had many selections and my husband said his omelet was the best he\u2019s ever had. The coffee was perfection and the service was attentive and prompt. We made our way back to the room and were surprised by the Head Butler Anila and Cyra with a beautifully displayed chocolate cake, a card signed by the hotel general manager, and a bouquet of red roses in celebration of our wedding anniversary. Such a gorgeous display (we even got to take the flowers home) and the chocolate cake too, which was divine.As we were granted a late checkout time, we opted to spend the rest of the morning into the afternoon in the same saltwater pool. Same fabulous pool side attention, gorgeous weather, and a fabulous breeze. We remarked several times how relaxing it was and how it felt like a three-day vacation, when it hadn\u2019t even been 24 hours yet! At 1:30 we made our way back to the room and said our goodbyes to the pool staff. Cyra and Karan were there to pack up a bottle of champagne we didn\u2019t drink, the bouquet of roses, and the cake. Check out was taken care of at the butler\u2019s desk on the floor and we made our way down to the lobby escorted by Cyra. We didn\u2019t make it to the spa or to the pool on the 18th floor. We\u2019ve visited the Sky View Bar and Al Muntaha on other visits so we didn\u2019t make it this time. Al Mahara was under renovation and we hope to visit soon. The terrace pool is one of the most divine pools I\u2019ve experienced.Verdict: If it\u2019s in your budget and you can afford it, stay here. The Burj Al Arab has a wow factor however dated some of the d\u00e9cor might feel (it opened in 1999). The staff and the awe-inspiring interior are what set this property apart from others. Certainly, there are numerous options to be found in Dubai, but to have the privilege of being a guest in this hotel is not to be missed. We approached our stay with an attitude that it has to be done once in a lifetime, at least. We left with the conviction that for as long as we live in Dubai, this will be an annual event. A massive thank you to the staff who made our stay extra special, our greeter (Susanne, I think), our butlers, Cyra, Kelly and Karan (and one other whose name I missed), to Paul and Mahmoud Harris at the pool and to the Turkish man at Bab Al Yam with the American accent \u2013 sincerely, thank you. We look forward to seeing you again very, very soon."

We have done Dubai for the past 5 years staying at least twice per year in many different hotels/resorts so I'm aware of the quality of what it has to offer but the Burj is on another level for so many reasons...too many to mention! Starting with the arrival, we hired the rolls Royce from the airport which is 1000AED, my wife received lovely roses and we had a music menu en route , upon arrival we are greeted by at least 5 people welcoming us. Checkin is done in the suite , we had a panoramic suite situated on the front of the hotel and has a sweeping view of the Dubai coastline. The suite was fantastic, huge downstairs and very spacious and luxurious upstairs. Nothing is spared, full Hermes toiletries in both bathrooms . Some lovely touches Along the way such as a cake and flowers congratulating us on our marriage one week before. I could go on forever about things like this there are so many and the butlers are fantastic.We had afternoon tea also in sky bar on the Saturday and our waiter Zen was brilliant and so knowledgable and passionate about what he was doing. The new terrace is fantastic , huge and spacious, so many beds with a freshwater pool also and swim up bar. It was only a week old, plenty of security checking that ur actually staying there so no tourists taking pics which is good! For a change we visited the madinat over the water and visited pai Thai, buggies outside help you get there and then a little arbra takes you right to restaurant. Take plenty of smaller note denominations to tip these guys as they work hard and non stop like any of the service people in Dubai ! The place is fantastic , we will definitely be back next year again child free and it's a little sanctuary from reality, out of this world, can't wait already to go back!!! "

            "review": "AL MUNTAHA evening meal. Booked on line prior to arriving in Dubai, confirmation of booking was comprehensive. Arrived about 30 minutes prior to the seating time so had a look around the Burj prior to dining. I must say, the service was very personal and professional. The hotel was, in itself, worth the restaurant visit!! What a stunning piece of architecture and such an iconic landmark of Dubai so allow a little more time to have a look! The service in the restaurant was first class and of course, what you would expect from this hotel. Staff very courteous and nothing was too much for them. First class.The views over Dubai were second to none. Arrived for sun set. I would suggest that a little modernisation is required as the restaurant does appear to be a little dated in its decor. (Minor point)The reason why I am giving this a 4 star rating and not the 5 is purely the limitations on the menu and I guess the quality of the meal. I have to say, very impressed that they had Welsh lamb on the menu, however, the overall menu was limited. The taster menu looked OK, albeit for the price, I would have expected more choice. Food was well presented and tasty.Had the duck for starter and what I consider the biggest mound of salad I have ever seen!! It was a salad, nothing more, nothing less, it was as if someone had opened a bag of salad from tesco's and placed it on my plate. For the main, I had the rib eye steak, medium, well cooked and seasoned. I in no way claim to be a food critic but I can honestly say I have had a better steak at Miller and Carter. The accompanying veg was the usual asparagus tips and mashed potato, of which, was very similar to smash...... I will leave that one there! The dessert was a sticky toffee pudding with ice cream. You can't really go wrong with that!! Overall, 5 star service with 3 star food. For the price (for 2 of us, starter, main, dessert, cocktails and bottle of wine, \u00a3450) I would have expected to be completely wowed and looking forward to my next visit, however, it is an experience to visit but would consider eating elsewhere in the future.

Guys, make sure you wear full length trousers and you make a prior appointment before visiting - if you don't mind spending several hundred US Dollars or British Pound Sterling on one or two fizzy drinks only, then head to this building - it's required before an appointment is booked and you're let in - building-wise, the hotel looks impressive like a boat's sail resisting the wind, but that is it really - everything else, you'll get elsewhere - 7star hotel? I don't think so - but you be the judge"

Bit chaotic!As you go up the escalator check out the huge aquariums on either side.When you arrive at the entrance for the Skyview bar you are politely greeted & shown to the lift. The view from the lift is great but it does whizz up! You're greeted at the top & shown to your table. The service & food is amazing.You probably won't be able to eat all your cakes so do ask for them to be boxed up for you. They are more than happy to do this.Also do mention when you book of you're going there for a special occasion.There's lots of room if you want to go to the windows & take photos.

The gold on 27 is actually on the 54th floor! You get awesome sites from your seats, privacy, class and guess what there are staff to open the toilet doors for you! The toilet has hot towels and Hermes cream and the bar is just out of this world. We had lovely non alcoholic drinks for like 60Aed each and got some complimentary nuts and water.

            "review": "First class surprise stay <Engagement!> . We came to stay at the Dar Al Masyaf for a week during half term back in the uk. Unknown to my girlfriend I had planned a surprise engagement proposal (she said yes thankfully!) at the Burj Al Arab which was superbly arranged by Tarik Skim guest services manager at the Dar Al Masyaf. The whole experience was planned and executed to absolute military precision and the service was first class from start to finish. In summary we were collected in a beautiful white Rolls Royce one of the Burj's many on their fleet and drive the short drive to the hotel from the lobby of Al Qasr. The start was perfectly executed by Naval our butler at the Dar Al Masyaf (whom I was praise in the review of their hotel separately). On arrival at the Burj (as a frequent visitor to the Jumeirah group of hotels here in Dubai for the last 16 years) we were greeted like no other hotel in the world has ever done before. A personal greeting was received by one of the staff who led us to the 19th Floor and told that we have been upgraded to a 'club suite' room. Words cannot describe the room or the service. If you go to YouTube and search for Burj Al Arab engagement you'll find our videos of the stay and I will later review the rooms. There once everything was settled and we'd got over the shock and amazement of the room I proposed in the room with the most amazing backdrop. My partner had NO idea of my plans whatsoever and the staff and our butler did everything to absolute perfection. We later went to the new Terrace (north deck) which was an experience to behold (again check my videos). That night we ate the most indulgent and exquisite meal at Al Mahara beside the aquarium in the basement of the hotel and we were gobsmacked at the service, quality and sheer class of the food. A perfect engagement meal. On the second morning I was introduced to Daniela, head of butler services. Daniela and her team (a special mention goes to Monika-director as well who arranged what was to follow) dealt with the surprise arrival of my girlfriends parents who had checked into the Dar Al Masyaf in the room opposite ours and then whilst liaising with me at breakfast via test message incredibly discreetly, had them delivered to our room to complete the most amazing piece of the jigsaw to this special trip. Again this is filmed on the video on my YouTube channel. Trust me when I say it went exactly how I had planned it to the exact five minutes in timing. After we showed my fianc\u00e9's parents around (she believed they were in Venice!) we were invited to the Terrace deck for lunch were they chilled and served our own Champagne given as a gift by the arriving special guests. While we sunbathed on the deck they informed us when the bubbly was chilled and subsequently served with a fantastic poolside lunch from the California style menu at the bar. The staff at the terrace did absolutely everything they could to further enhance our stay. Then as a gesture from the Hotel we were shown to another suite where for a further night they once again hosted us all in a two bedroomSuite which wasn't not expected by my future in-laws and just the most amazing surprise. We were looked after from start to finish in a way that I simply could not have wished for in my most outlandish dreams. The Burj Al Arab, Daniela especially and its staff went above and beyond what I had heard about the hotel and what I had seen on documentaries and read in trip advisor reviews. What I would say is we aren't film stars, footballers or royalty yet we were made to feel every bit as if we belonged there. While it isn't 'cheap' but I didn't not regret the cost and alas if you want details of how to achieve the best prices for a stay see my channel and ask in the comments.No more words can capture the experience. Thank you Burj Al Arab, Daniela, Tarik, Monika and all the staff that made this the most memorable holiday for my fianc\u00e9 and I \u2764\ufe0f"

A deposit was paid at the booking stage also which was none refundable. On arrival you cannot help but be blow away by the pure essence of the building. The lobby area is breath-taking with a floor to ceiling like water fountain. We were taken up to the restaurant in a glass elevator which in itself offered amazing views. We were seated adjacent to the windows (we weren\u2019t lucky enough to get a window seat) but that didn\u2019t take anything away from the experience. Drinks arrived immediately and the food was so good I cannot even try to put into words. You are free to move around the restaurant and take in the views and take pictures. The ambience is peaceful and you can relax in the luxury, feeling comfortable. I would recommend dressing for this occasion, even if you feel slightly overdressed for a lunch date. This experience isn\u2019t cheap experience but I can promise its worth every penny. "

            "review": "The surroundings luckily make up for slipping standards . This was my 5th stay now at the burj al Arab and we have been visiting here since 2012. After having beyond great experiences in the past this time we decided to share our experience we often speak about with family. Upon check in at the hotel everything was quick and accommodating as usual. We was all very excited and safe to say our guests was overwhelmed with the prospect of the week Ahead. Luckily for us the new terrace opened the day we arrived. This is an amazing space overlooking the Arabian gulf and just what the burj needed to keep it up to date and some edge over its competitors. Must say too it's great positioning as you get a great sea breeze which in Dubai's summer heat is fully appreciated. We asked to book a cabana on the new terrace and the floor butler sorted this for us. They told us to let them no when we are going down and they'll escort us as it's the first day they just want to ensure all transitions well. We got ready made them aware we are wanting to go down and nobody was around to do so. We then saw someone who was also faced with having the check two other guests out Aswell as ourselves. I explained what we was waiting for and she told us to just go downstairs she will call to make them aware. We made our way down and it is pristine and amazingly laid out! However nobody was really around to direct us. We then explained we had a cabana booked and he looked confused. After making us walk around in the Dubai heat he told us to wait. Someone who looked more senior then came over and said she had bad news the cabana only sits two people and there was four of us. She could offer us a Royal cabana which was bigger but it was near triple in price. I then explained the floor butler had confirmed the cabana booking with us and had told us to go down and now they had this news. This was the first sign of the bad breakdown in communication.....She offered it us at a discounted rate for the inconvenience which was appreciated but after waiting for some time already we declined and stayed on the normal loungers. She later came to apologise again and later that day they came to our room with chocolates and flowers. There is no doubt that the staff are eager to give you a good service and for that we always respect. The next day we came down later in the afternoon and we was stood again in the heat looking around for an attendant. You see many of them in the pink uniforms gathered at the sides but somehow they don't see the guests or efficient at helping you. We was stood for 15min trying to get someone attention and after asking three of them for towels one of us had to walk to the other side to get someones attention properly, again this was a slow process as he was having to go back and forth for water & towels. I really do think they need a system in place, there's security on the front of the terrace checking your room number it be good if the attendants where near there and they escorted you down as you checked in along with the waters and towels. This system they do at many hotels and other Jumeirah hotels and works fine. Once we was settled there was a man near us who was shouting as he was stood in the heat for a long time while he asked FOUR attendants for towels who all said \"1min sir\" it was not 1 minute and he was then heard complaining while dripping in sweat. Later that day we went to get food! They don't serve the same menu as they do round the original pool. They also won't let you order from that menu either as we did ask. The terrace menu is only small with little choice and they have tried to be quite Sophisticated with their choices. When asked if we could have one of the pizza's without cheese (dairy allergy) & the burger without sauce they seemed to tell us they don't think they can. We had to ask if they could then ask the chef.... Again this wasn't the \"7 star service\" where almost anything is possible we was once used too. We felt we was almost having to tell the waiter how to do his job. Later that day a family Infront of us was complaining too about the little menu choice and had to wait over a hour for food.... To which the food came and they didn't prioritise their children's food first which they had asked - most places of this nature would do this as a no brained and they also had to complain there coffee was cold. Again we are listening and observing to complaints something which we have never done before during the years here.....We had to ask for turn down each night as one night they forgot to do it. Minor things like this we don't mind! But again when you pay the amount you do here and you see two butlers outside you'r door sat there you do expect it. One evening we had the DND sign on and was sleeping And they called our room to ask about membership scheme when I explained the sign was on she paused and said sorry which was fine but again it's as though nobody is checking things before they act. They made some restaurant reservations to which they printed our confirmations all wrong and when asked the time of our booking they didn't no, so we would have to call the restaurant to double check. Again I know these are minor issues but they are teething problems you expect from new hotels or staff members which is neither in this situation. We asked for ice cream one day down at the new pool which you'd expect in a hot county they'd be serving a lot and they told us they don't do it. The attendants often go off and can be seen discussing your requests with 3/4 other attendants before someone then comes back and asks what is it you want, you order then your order comes and it's wrong anyway...... Again I don't no if it's a case they don't understand or it's just a real bad break down in communication. The hotel was rather quiet during our stay and having the training programmes for staff and facilities this hotel I know has you just expect a better service. One evening we made our way back to our rooms and two of our family members who was staying in the room next door was stopped and we was asked if we new them & are they our visitors.. All butlers should be familiar with their guests and for me I found that quite rude. We recently stayed at the new four seasons some months ago and they are newly opened and service was next level. They was on first name terms with guests and They had buzzer service for around pool which I think this new space would benefit as it is quite large and loungers are hid away and private. Which becomes annoying when trying to get someone's attention. They also didn't have the complimentary amenities around the pool or to the rooms. We was offered shots of mocktails, ice lollies, sunglasses cleaning ect or evening drinks or canap\u00e9's to your room at all other Jumeirah hotels and have had it when stayed and the burj previously. But there was nothing this stay....For us having that personal approach and all these little touches is what makes the hotel stand out and leaves us eager to return each time.The rooms, location, quietness and appearance of the new terrace luckily still made our stay enjoyable. But the big factor of service did let it down compared to previous stays. I think everyone should stay here if they can as majority you'll have a special experience. and after all I would like to put our experience down to the new opening appose to thinking this is now just a 5star hotel than the 7star it has a reputation for...."

Booked a limo to arrive in style and so glad we did as soon as you get passed security and drive over the private bridge to this Iconic Hotel you can see the extravagance everywhere nothing is done by half.First and foremost is the Guest Experience the staff here are world class and from the first member of staff opening our car door to the Sky Bar staff to the goodbye everyone was First Class.We had booked for 4pm and were advised to arrive early to check in which we did at the back of the hotel which is where the sky bar lifts are.You then can look around the lobby area at your hearts content taking photos of all the fountains and stunning architecture. It had been a dream to come to this hotel since it was built and whilst staying here would be out of my budget afternoon tea for a special day was a must.At first i thought the 60 plus guests would be a scrum for the lifts but after registering the staff call you forward in groups of 6 which was a great way to deal with the group awaiting there experience. The glass lift ride was amazing as you had a great view of the Gulf and the beach areas. On arrival at the Sky Bar we were greeted and escorted to our window table which i felt very privileged to have. Then the experience began one glass of champagne which is included in the package which is enough as its not the place to get tipsy.Our waiter explained the menu and the timings etc and one after one delicious food arrived plentiful in size and cakes and sandwiches could be refreshed if you wanted more.Only thing which i have said to the Burj was the sandwiches which were very nice could have had more simple combinations as perhaps too many flavours going on.We were not rushed at all and everything just flowed and even after two hours the afternoon tea goes into the bar and evening meals so you are not pushed to leave at all.Took loads of photos and make sure you walk around and ask to go to both sides of sky bar even if its roped off as the views are amazing.We were given two special cakes for our Anniversary and my birthday and my wife was even given a fresh red rose.If you cannot eat the deserts the Sky Bar will box them up which is nice and the box with the logo on is a nice souvenir to have.We left the sky bar and went in the lift just at sunset which was amazing and it all seemed to be a bit of a dream and it could not sink in what i had experienced.We then stayed in the foyer for a while watching life go by soaking up all the atmosphere and building. The flowers on site are stunning too.We met some lovely people here too and once conversations were over we left the hotel and as soon as we stepped outside the guest experience happened again. The valet parking /greeter summoned a taxi for us and of course did the doors but in the last 2 minutes of waiting a female manager appeared from nowhere and started chatting to us about our day , she was Scottish and lovely but both myself and my wife felt like in the quick 2 minute conversation we had known this lady and she had known us all our lives it was a surreal experience but a great end to our afternoon here. This Scottish lady in a grey trouser suit made the day finish in the right way .So if in Dubai and you have a special day go and experience it .Thanks Burj Al Arab"

I have visited the 27th floor twice, once for an evening meal in the Al Muntaha restaurant and the second visit was to experience the afternoon tea in the Skyview Bar. I shall review both here.Al Muntaha is a 5* restaurant inside a 7* hotel. It of course offers excellent service, delicious food and impeccable decor. However, if you - like us - are not millionaires, and are just looking to experience eating inside the Burj Al Arab, an evening meal in Al Muntaha is NOT what I would recommend as being a first choice. The reasons for that are simple. We were quite disappointed with the views, as of course the sun had already set and although you can see a lot, it's mainly just the city lights and the darkness of the sea. You can't really make anything out. Also, the food is good, but we just couldn't justify it! You can probably get better food in restaurants that are more than half the price. Lastly, when we sat at our table we were asked if we would like a glass of champagne...being naive brits, we assumed this was free, so it was a huge shock when we received our bill! We felt that this should have been pointed out to us before we agreed, or at least shown a champagne menu to get an idea of prices. \u00a340 for one glass of champagne was really quite ridiculous. The afternoon tea at the Skyview Bar, however, should be seriously considered if you wish to visit this beautiful piece of architecture. Unfortunately, we cannot compare it to either the Afternoon Tea or the High Tea at the Sahn Eddar as we have not been, but I can definitely recommend it more than the Al Muntaha experience. The first reason for this is the food selection. If you are eating in the Al Muntaha restaurant, you are likely to only try 3 things; your choice of starter, main and dessert. With the afternoon tea, you are served a number of courses containing miniature delights allowing you to taste many different items - and if you really like a particular one - you can order more! I am a very fussy eater - but I can honestly say there was nothing I didn't like! And the scones - being British we felt very critical - but my goodness they were to die for! Here, we started with a FREE glass of champagne and unlimited tea, coffee and water. Yes it is 620dhs per person, but this is far less than what you will end up spending in Al Muntaha. And you feel totally satisfied that you have got your monies worth, as opposed to feeling ripped off. Plus, the daylight views across Jumeirah and the rest of Dubai are just fabulous compared to at night.I hope this helps! If you are planning to visit Dubai - start saving and make sure this is on your list of things to do/places to visit!"

The view from the bar was good but it depends where you are sitting to get a good view of the palm. When we left the hotel we wanted to get a taxi but we're ignored by the door staff and had to ask for assistance.

From an artistic point of view I personally think it is beautiful and if you see from the see it looks like an arabic sail boat. It its a pretty tall building with beautiful blue and white tones.From inside it is very barroque and full of gold and precious materials. Really impressiveI recommend to go there for breakfast one day (around 50-100\u20ac)"

True to its name, this bar is all gold and on the 27th floor, with views to the north and east over the gulf and city. The signature cocktails are expensive (about $30) but worth the experience. We ordered cocktails and 2 appetizers to share, and that was enough for dinner. The hotel decor is way over the top - you have to see it to believe it!"

The view from the 27 is a bit far away from the financial centre or marina area - so the main attraction is the Jumeirah hotel in-front of you and the mall of emirates. It is quite calming though, looking out to the ocean. The drinks menu had some lower-priced options such as beer and non-alcoholic juices.They do take the collar shirt policy seriously - and have jackets available for you to \"cover-up\" if you come in with a t-shirt."

A group of team members visiting the UAE were given the opportunity to visit the Burj Al Arab. So many pictures of Dubai show this structure in the background. Why do I recall the first visit? The four of us got out our Ministry van. I was last to exit. It was getting dark. I stopped because something about the Valet Parking area caught my attention. There was a row of 13 Rolls-Royces lined up as for inspection. I think I had, at the point, seen four in my life. Upon entry the gold doors, gold pillars and everything else helped understand why this hotel is SO special. My group went to the top of the building to look out at the view and relax in a lounge area. Later, we went down to about the fourth floor to dine on wonderful Lebanese food. On a couple other lower level floors the most exclusive and prestigious clothing, jewelry, and shoe stores abounded. No price tags! I assumed that if you had to ask you were in the wrong place. :) I have been back in recent years to visit -- not to get a suite. Frankly, I couldn't afford it. The Burj Al-Arab is a wonder to behold. It is absolutely worth a visit. It is unlike anywhere I have ever visited..."

Our butler greeted us on arrival and showed us around the suite. We've received complimentary Burj Al Arab wine (which we kept as a souvenir) and Arabic sweets in a lovely Burj Al Arab shaped box. The bathroom is very luxurious stocked up with Hermes amenities and every guest receives Hermes perfume as a gift. As it was our anniversary we've also received a chocolate cake and beautiful roses with a card - it was a lovely touch. In the evening we had a complimentary canap\u00e9s and our butler prepared a jacuzzi hot tub for us. We've had a breakfast by the pool, it was a buffet with plenty of choice. We've also had a lunch in the same place and everything was very tasty. The staff is very polite and helpful.The pool area is peaceful with great views of the coast and the Palm. There's a sunbathing deck/extension being build at the moment but we couldn't hear any noise so nothing was disturbing. It looked like it will be completed very soon and it will look amazing so that will be just another reason to visit Burj Al Arab again. For the dinner we've choose Al Mahara restaurant that is located in underground and have a fabulous aquarium which makes your dinning experience truly special. Overall great stay, can highly recommend to everyone!"

When I found it was mostly self-proclaimed, I thought I'd go to check it out. Having been built in 1999, this building/hotel is old by Dubai standards, but is iconic.The hotel itself is very nice- top notch security at the front making sure that you have a reservation before letting in all the riffraff trying to get a pic. Then greeted by name at the front and shown around. We had a panoramic suite (1412) and it was gorgeous. It's 2 floors so maybe not great for those with mobility issues. Everything is top notch and you have a floor butler that will help you with anything your heart desires. We had the culinary flight which takes you through all the hotel's restaurants- one entree at a time. It was awesome but a little overindulgent. Everything at this hotel is over the top, but for a \"7 star\" there are a few lacking things- they are renovating a bit and some of it was dirty/unsightly. The outside pool was tiny and not that great (there was a lifeguard there and one person inside the pool- a joke if you ask me!) and our floor butler gave my friend (visitor) a hard time about not having brought her passport to the hotel (she was coming to the spa with me, not checking into the airport!). Overall? Five stars, sure- but not quite 7."

We booked 3 rooms, GM upgraded one room to a club suite which was Very kind of him but when checked in ,their staff seems to think it was a super favour to us. Fair enough guests had to leave by 12am but they should have communicated during check in but they failed to do so, instead at 11:20pm ( we were back in hotel at 11:10pm) their staff Daniela and Fatima knocked on our door and told us / lectured us saying basically my guests had to leave now, later when I discussed a little more they said 12am but if not they will call the security and they asked us to sign a voucher to confirm if guests don't leave by 12am then they will charge us AED1800 per person. Obviously the hotel have all the right to charge us and I am happy to pay if they stay , but the way to deliver the message was wrong and rude. Breakfast was poor, slow service and limited choices. The worst is Daniela and Fatima accused my 60+ years old aunts pushed their colleague, I asked their duty manager to check their cctv , and the duty manager confirmed to me they couldn't record any pushing. I asked the duty manager to investigate properly and get back to me why would Daniela and Fatima would have made such an accusation which is very unfair to my guests- my aunts. Overall, I don't rate it a 7 star and I will not stay there again.on top of that, room 1903, where my mom and dad stayed , it had a terrible stink which was confirmed later by their room manager it was due to their carpet, my poor mom and dad didn't make any complaint to change room as it was quite late when they wanted a room change but they rather just stayed there to avoid further argument after the late visit by Daniela and Fatima. Very disappointing stay."

Seafood is top quality and cooked to your order at buffet.Remember you are not paying for the food only.

We were staying at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel which is directly opposite the Burj Al Arab, we wanted to visit the hotel as it was something on our must see list whilst in Dubai....after all it's not often you get to taste what a 7 star hotel has to offer. You can do afternoon tea or evening drinks but we opted for the latter so made a reservation in advance. As the hotel we stayed in is linked to the Burj Al Arab we hopped on a golf buggy within our hotel and were driven round to the grand entrance of the hotel, at the bridge there was a quick security check to ensure our names were on the list. As we approached the entrance there were bentleys, rolls Royces and lots of grand cars. There was a short escalator ride to the next floor (at this point were looking up and taking in all of the grand decor of the hotel including the huge aquarium built into the walls) we then reached a desk and were escorted into lifts that took us up to the top floor. On arrival we were greeted again and taken to our seats. The sky view bar is gorgeous and there is a relaxed but sophisticated ambiance. Our first seats were away from the window as it was busy but we were attended to immediately and given menus with a short introduction into the fabulous cocktail menu (roughly \u00a335) a cocktail but it's worth every penny. We were then brought canap\u00e9s such as olives, nuts & mini quiches on a platter in the shape of the hotel which was a nice touch, we were also offered the choice of ordering additional food or bar snacks from the menu. Shortly after our first drink arrived we were offered a window seat which was just amazing....although it was night time the views were incredible seeing the whole of Dubai lit up including our hotel and the Burj Khalifa but I would imagine in the day it could be that bit better but still loved every second. We met a really nice Scottish couple who we got chatting to. I had a cocktail with petals in it and I really enjoyed it. I was then surprised with a birthday cake with a candle which I had no idea about so that was sweet. A really nice waiter called Sardor served us who was really polite and smiled a lot. As we left the Burj we were expecting to jump on a golf buggy to be escorted back to our hotel but Paul joked with one of the lobby staff and said to him to get his Bentley ready just joking next minute he clicked his fingers and said I can give you the next best thing, his colleague then drove a top of the range bmw to us and told us to jump in....we were then drove round to the front of our hotel, this may seem like absolutely nothing to some people but it's little touches like that, that make them very memorable. Although the drinks aren't cheap I would highly recommend the experience and the hotel. We will definitely be visiting again"

All 6 ft and above - just like signing up for The Guards in the army y'know.Been to the cafe in the lounge a few times, and to Al Muntaha, which is a seafood restaurant, rather nice - and which threw a majorly exciting bash on new year. The food, and the view made up for the v.expensive price tag. We (including a couple of Cuban American lasses who Know how to party) responded by ordering bubbly and had corks flying for a while. It might be time to try another restaurant there. Wait for the review."

Impressive view, though there was a haze that day.The decor is very much 'look at my wad!', not really my taste, but, if you are in the area.."

Before we were seated, we explored the lobby and first floor with solid gold everything and fountains. There were upscale stores as well.The afternoon tea was a decadent, seven course experience with tea, champagne, juices and soft drinks along with tea sandwiches, scones and other goodies.

Yeah have to reserve in advance and the drinks are not cheap, but it's worth every penny just go do the 7 star experience and see inside this amazing hotel. I was disappointed however that the bar was a smoking bar,mans equally disappointed that the hotel does not have a dress code. We made the special effort only to step into a lift full of Japanes tourists staying in the hotel dressed in T -Shirts and flip flops. So it kind of took the glam off our visit. All the same visit the bar, to say you have been there."

They said they operate on a first come first served basis for tables but offered to do their best for us. Well on the day we were shown to a fabulous table in the window with 2 very comfy armchairs and proceeded to enjoy the most expansive and tasty afternoon tea we have ever had served by a very attentive and efficient waiter. Towards the end he presented us with a small cake with Happy Anniversary in chocolate and a red rose for me to present to my wife-what a nice touch.It was expensive at 620dms per person but regardless of it being a special occasion for us sometimes in life you just have to do certain things and this is one of them."

When in Dubai this is one of those iconic buildings that you have to make the effort to see with your own eyes and take your memories of it home in your camera. It's quite cheap/easy to get to by Metro/tram and bus and this transport system provides you with views over other parts of the city. You aren't allowed to enter the hotel grounds but you can get decent positions for photographs at the entrance. We found that to optimise the use of time whilst in the vicinity it was good to walk just down the road and visit the Souk Madinat Jumeirah which is well worth a look around too - also benefits from having toilets, restaurants, the opportunity for a little boat trip and a good view of the Burj Al Arab (see pic)."

What motivated him was -- one day, when he was in another country he showed his passport, the immigration officer did not know where Dubai was. He then bowed to make sure that it does not happen. This building was one of his many projects. There's construction going on all over Dubai. I also heard they are going to build all the 7 wonders of the world. I wonder how will that turn out. "

We counted at least 7 people serving us so all of us would get the same dish simultaneously. They had prepared a menu for us with wine specifically selected for each dish. The food... Oh the food... It was all an artwork. I couldn't memorise all those French names for every dish but the desert was just stunning. After the meal we had time to explore the public areas of the hotel. I really don't know how to describe the tastefully designed opulence everywhere. It's really worthwhile to go there for a lunch or high tea.

The view is breathtaking. Unfortunately, February was still a cold month and I could not swim outside. The cuisine was good. not every one of our group appreciated the food but Chinese are choosy with their food to the extreme. The service is excellent. Every one assumes that service is proportional to price. Go to the Sheratons in London and you'll know that assumption is wrong."

Evening canapes and drinks were also served before dinner and on our last night a stunning chocolate tree with strawberries was delivered by Stephanie and her team, so a big thank you for all you did and not forgetting Nimal for all his help in arranging the surprise......they loved it as much as we do...Thank to all the staff we encountered for being soo kind once again.

Not sure if I wrote about it but I had such a lovely experience at the Burj Al Arab in January 2016 when I was on business in Dubai. There are times when I have been on business I have been a solo traveler. Thoughts come to mind for some who wonder since they are alone should they order takeaway every night at the hotel? I happen to think quite opposite of this. Why visit a new place in the world sitting in your hotel every night? When you can go and venture out - you should. I do and I did when I went to the Burj. The last time I was in Dubai I went to the Burj Khalifa for tea which was lovely but wanted to go to Burj Al Arab. I had written about the experience months ago in a journal but wanted to post here. As a recap I enjoy going to afternoon tea. When I found out I was going to Dubai the first thing I did was make a reservation for tea. Did I go up or down? Well there was two tea options. One was downstairs on the first level but I chose to go upstairs instead to a room called the Skyview Bar. I had made a tentative reservation for my colleague just in case if they were able to go but that did not happen so I went. I went alone. Gasps............alone you ask??????? To the seven star hotel of all places?YES I went alone.Because I could and I had the opportunity in my hands and I chose to take it.Have you ever heard of Seizing the day or the moment?WHY NOT!Why not live life. Why not just do it! Why need an excuse.I did it simple as that!Once inside and instructed where to go I stopped and took some photos and to my left and right were some of the hugest aquariums I have ever seen. I had to take the escalator up and go into the back almost like into the \u201cspine of the sail\u201d. I cannot honestly describe how it looks inside except it looks so exotic and rich. It is one of those places if you are into stuff like this even to experience once you just have to go in there. Really stunning and parts of it are dim lit however once you get up to the top of the escalator and look up it will blow you away. The architect whoever designed this really is on one other abstract level. It has this sort of Arabian feel but -------how the hotel, or the architecture is aligned with the rich blue. Wow the decor is beautiful. Really out of this world. Architecture alone it is a masterpiece. Once to the back you have a choice. To the right elevators (glass) is where you go if you are staying at the hotel and to the back you have the hotels that take you to the top and you can top !!!!!!!!! To the Skyview Bar! Once you get there they are totally expecting you and then you walk through a very Arabian looking door case and then voila you are there. You have a panoramic view from the 27th floor! When I was seated I was seated by the window as I had requested. I must say I felt like a Diva up there. Fearless let me tell you! Once seated I was greeted to explain the menu and was also greeted with a plate of dates. Another person came over to greet me and said \u201cIs there something special we are celebrating today?\u201d. I said yes there is. I am celebrating me. The actual service was pretty spectacular. There were 7 to 8 portions and the afternoon tea itself is broken down into 2 pages that define what you are getting. I started off the tea with a glass of champagne admiring on the 27th floor Palm Jumeriah to my left while the sun went down and Downtown Dubai to my right. I was treated with the utmost respect considering I was alone. The food and service was impeccable. I ended up with a takeaway bag with some scones but for this experience for tea writing is one thing. Experience is another. Without giving you more details I suggest you go and experience. BTW It was around $170.00 USD for one person. Yes it was worth it. Will share photos later"

Food quality is first class as you might expect but surprisingly, it is also more than enough in terms of quantity. If you don't have enough time when you arrive, make sure you take some time to scout round the lobby, lounge areas and shops - not quite your normal high street options....'Chopard' etc all on view. One of those things life which I will always remember............"

Even if you have seen lots of photos and videos of this place until you see and experience it in real life you can't appreciate how amazing it is. Sitting alone on a promontory it is so visible as if no other building dare encroach. We paid about $3,000 for one night for the basic suite, and they only have suites, so we had high expectations which they managed to exceed. Our suite was two story and enormous with lavish decor and amenities. You can ecperience a slice of life that only the very few will. Needless to say the service was exceedingly good and personal. If you can justify a stay don't miss it."

We were staying at the Jumeirah Beach hotel and it wasn't until we got talking to a couple who had holidayed in Dubai before that we found out you can visit the bar at the Burj Al Arab for a drink if you are staying at the Sister hotel. You need to go to the Jumeirah Beach Information Desk by reception to tell them that you want to go for a drink at Burj Al Arab, as they will need to call ahead to the hotel to check there is space available and also to print off a letter to allow you entry into this hotel. You are then able to jump on one of the golf carts used to transport people around the Jumeirah beach resort to get across to this hotel.When you arrive in the hotel it is breath taking to see - everything is gold and sparkly you can tell that this hotel is a cut above the rest! You are shown to the elevator at the back which takes you straight up to the bar on the observation level. We had two cocktails which were out of this world, the presentation alone blew us away and the flavour of both cocktails was lovely. The atmosphere was a little pretentious so for that reason we only stayed for the one drink each and then left but it is definitely worth the experience just to see the levels of luxury this hotel has to offer."

I booked a stay at the Burj Al Arab as a belated birthday surprise for my hubby and everything was magnificent from the moment we entered the lobby. Staff serve dates and refreshing towels are given to guests on entry and the check in is conducted from your suite. There are fish tanks on each side of the escalators and a large fountain in the lobby and another one upstairs. The suite was huge and big enough to fit another 4 people - note that the bedroom, bathroom and walk-in wardrobes are upstairs, so if stairs are a difficulty to navigate, reconsider. We were very touched by the arrival of a birthday cake for my hubby, even though his birthday had passed. A complimentary bottle of wine (you can choose red or wine), water and fresh fruit (you can also order fruit of your preference) are provided daily and we received a little gift each night, which was placed on each side of the bed. All guests receive complimentary Hermes toiletries and the bedroom slippers are the most comfortable I've worn (hubby brought his home). Everything in the hotel is opulent and magnificent - staff are unobtrusive but always on hand to greet guests and a butler is on hand to assist with any needs as well. It was the grandest hotel we've stayed in and probably ever will and is ideal if you want to splurge on a luxurious getaway."

On arrival at our floor we walked through a short passageway of green and gold then we stepped into the Skyview bar/restaurant. The only disappointment of the day was that we weren't seated at a window despite making our reservation being made well in advance (my fault, I didn't request a window seat). The restaurant is bright and airy with a grand piano and pianist adding to the relaxed ambience. It was faultless from start to finish, from the moment we entered the building until we left. Our champagne afternoon tea was excellent with the produce sourced from all over the world (smoked salmon from Bonnie Scotland, clotted cream from Devon). Our smoked salmon mousse inside a choux bun was topped with caviar and gold leaf!!! We weren't rushed at all and spent several hours enjoying the experience. The waiting staff were delightful and informative and as the bar emptied they gave us some interesting facts about the hotel and its surrounds. Food, drink, service 1st class but so is Gleneagles & Cromlix House) Not sure if I'd return, I've done it and I'mglad I have. It's a unique experience."

We were told to have a look around the building, take photos etc and be back at the desk just before 4pm as we had requested a window seat, and it's first come first served.We were the third couple called to take the lift up to the restaurant, and were shown to a table over looking the Jumierah Beach Hotel. It was a clear day so had a lovely view.We had a lovely waiter, I think called Zen, who talked us through the menu. We had a glass of champers to start with, with dates, and then worked our way through the 6 courses. We chose to have extra sarnies as they were so nice, but then struggled with the cakes and scones. At the end of the meal they gave us a small cake for our anniversary, which they boxed up, with other leftovers, to take with us. There was a good choice of teas and soft drinks also on offer.In all we were in the restaurant for about 2 1/2 hours and found all the staff extremely professional, friendly and helpful. Even though it is expensive at 620 AED each I think it was well worth it as a one off."

We chose our first drink - cocktails (I couldn't drink it far too strong for me) and a bottle of water. The waiter was over constantly to ask if we wanted another drink. I had mentioned on our booking it was our honeymoon and the waiter came over with a red rose which was a lovely gesture. Thank you. We felt as though there was no atmosphere in there - we were seated across from each other quite far apart we asked if we could move our seats together but were told no. It was really cold in there - I was chittering the whole time. After 1.5 hours we were told we could now move up to the top so we could have the views. When the bill came I questioned an item on it and I was told it was a glass of rose wine - we never ordered wine. The manager appeared and apologised profusely about the error and gave us 2 small boxes of chocolates and a pen as a token of apology. I would probably not go here again, don't think it was worth the money."

The big moment came and when we walked in it is quite impressive - the scale of it, but the decor and style was not what I expected. It felt more Las Vegas than luxury. There really isn't much to see inside and maybe that is the point, but it what was there lacked a sophistication and felt more cartoonish or Cirque du Soleil. Can I say it would be worth a special trip to see the inside? No. And if it weren't for our dining reservation I would have been very disappointed if I had come to see the interiors and left after the short time it would take to take it all in.

When we booked this cruise and found out it offered an excursion to the renowned Burj Al Arab for High Tea I knew I had to book it. It was expensive at \u00a3140 per head, but when I looked online the hotel offered afternoon tea with a glass of champagne for \u00a3129 so I assumed it was the same. The excursion was described as high tea at the Burj Al Arab and panoramic city tour, so I thought the extra cost was attributed for the hour and a half bus tour.We left at 2.30pm and had a tour of the marina where we had a 15 minute photo stop. We were then taken to a souk where we had 50 minutes free time. From there we drove on to the Jumeirah Palm and were dropped off and had to walk to the Atlantis Hotel for another photo stop and then it was onto the Burj Al Arab. These stops do not constitute a panoramic city tour, but I didn't mind too much as it was the high tea that I wanted to sample.I have had afternoon tea at The Ritz and Claridges in London and I expected the same excellent standard but was very disappointed.We were on the 27th floor in a private room. There were 3 tables of 10 of us. The food had already been laid out and was pretty average and had been covered with a damp paper serviette to stop them drying out. There was no choice of different teas. This too had been prepared in advance and was poured from silver plastic flasks.We were served the sandwiches and when the chicken ones ran out they said that was it! There was one round of sandwich each with a couple of small cakes. The scones were served warm and you could have 2, but once the small bowl of cream for the table had run out that was it. We were in and out in 90 minutes and it was a very disappointing afternoon after looking forward to it all week.I did complain to the waiting on staff, but it didn't really make a difference. When I got back to the ship I went to the Excursion Desk and made a formal complaint to say I feel their advertising of this excursion is misleading. I was also asked to fill in a questionnaire about the trip and wrote a full page of the issues.I wish I had booked it myself on line as that would have been the real deal and got a taxi there as I probably won't return to Dubai so won't be able to do this again.Readers beware of this excursion offered by this cruise as you will be as disappointed as we were!"

Being a special occasion, we decided that the Burj Al Arab was a good venue to try it - we weren't wrong!This hotel, and the building in general, is spectacular. It's extremely elaborate and ornate, it seems like every part of it has gold trim.The afternoon tea itself was expensive, but not obscenely so, it was also well worth it. The views from the hotel are spectacular, and the service was brilliantWe were really looking forward to visiting the Burj Al Arab, and we really enjoyed the experience.It is extremely opulent, but it is well worth a visitIn a bit!Stephen"

My friend and I went to the Junshi buffet of Burj Al Arab on March 3, when we went there so earlier so that we stayed outside to take some pictures for a while until the restaurant opens at 6:00 PM. During our dinner, the waiter Vikram served us nicely and politely so that we were joyful and cared. The price is reasonable not too expensive. So I recommend the restaurant if anyone wants to go to Burj AI Arab for a dinner."

Friday no afternoon tea (holy day) so instead they do a brunch in the restaurant on 27th floor with the views & all. 10.00-4.30 (only day of the week they do it. NO alcohol!! and its \u00a320.00 cheaper per person if you go 10.00-12.00 and \u00a310.00 cheaper if you go 10.30-12.30. Two hours is a long time to stuff your face and although there is loads of food even I had to ay enough and come out in that 2 hours. The dishes are very wide & varied through the nationalities and taste buds with loads of hot & colds in starters & mains and live chefs cooking several dishes to order. sweets/chocolate/cheese & Tea & coffee & sort drinks a plenty; then down to the foyer for a couple of hours to people watch! what a place. I booked a week in advance to get a confirmed reservation.IF you are there on a Friday as no Afternoon Tea you can eat once for a few quid more and won't want to eat for a very long time!!Well worth that once in a lifetime extravagance!!"

There we waited for the staff to bring us to the 27th floor. We used the glass elevator(which I didnt enjoy due to my fear of height)but which my friends did.We were seated with the best view overlooking the radiant blue sea and the Palm Islands at a distance. The sunset was exquisite as we devoured the sandwiches and sconces brought to us one after the other. Our waiter was so pleasant, explaining every item that was on the plate. The food was good, we enjoyed it. Im planning to go back again and bring more friends with me."

The only problem was it was Ramadan, hence no alcohol until sunset. This was ok, as we adjusted our arrival time but it made dinner a much later experience. We started in the sky bar and experienced each course in a different restaurant.Upon entering the Hotel, the decor especially fish and water tanks and waterfalls was impressive. The staff were very helpful in explaining especially to my husband the programme for the evening. There are cheaper alternatives to experiencing Burj al Arab, from dining perspective afternoon tea if budget is a concern. I would recommend visiting and experiencing it from inside. It is spectacular. I would recommend the culinary flight, if it started earlier. It is easily 4 hours."

From The Grand entrance one enters one of the tallest lobby spaces that confirms that you are in a special Hotel. From then on everything is glitzy and expensive. No doubt one may debate about the many colours used in the rooms and public areas. But that makes this hotel so different from any other. one whole wall of a restaurant is a lovely fish tank. The Bars Restaurants all have unique expensive d\u00e9cor.The staff are from many different nationalities and all share a great pride in working at the Burj, They are very helpful and courteous and seems to be very eager to make visitors happy. The best rooms/suites have toilet shower area walls tiled with Gold surfaced wall tiles, the faucets are also plated in gold. Its very different from any other luxury hotel many people would have seen. That itself makes it a special place to visit. Definitely a place to stay when one has to celebrate a landmark event in your life like a honeymoon or an anniversary. This is not anyone's regular weekend hotel. Go there to celebrate. Must visit at least once in your life"

The Sky View bar lives up to it's name and has great views over the city.The food and drinks are as you would expect an quite expensive by Nottingham standards, but maybe not so much compared to other restaurants in Dubai.When you order your drinks you also receive a mini Burj Al Arab tower with a selection of nibbles - nuts, olives etc.We chose to have the Mezze to eat and ordered two, but the waiter said one would probably be enough - he was right! The Mezze was very good, but not exceptional.We're not really cocktail people, but thought we should try some while we were there and they were very pleasant, but I'd rather have a pint of real ale, sorry!So, overall an excellent, once in a lifetime experience, as they say \"You pay your money and you make your choice\"!"

This amused me somewhat.The car-park sets the tone, all supercars and Rolls Royces.

Everyone we met was welcoming but I felt a stranger in a strange land. I thought it was me but everyone else I spoke to felt the same.

We have been fortunate to visit on several occasions, and have never been disappointed. One of the easiest ways to visit is by dining in one of its restaurants, with Afternoon Tea in the Sky View Bar on of the least expensive at around 620AED.Ensure you make a reservation, and note the reservation number, as you will need it to get through the very tight security at the main gate or \u201cWelcome Centre\u201d as they call it. Bookings can be made only via the internet. Although you give credit card details, you don\u2019t pay until the actual visit. We did see one couple who came and stated that they had already paid on-line, so just check at time of booking so as not to embarrass yourself on the actual day (friendly warning). Booking times are from 1:00-1:30pm and 4:00-4:30pm, and if you are a little early, you can sit in the small waiting area and take photos. We always book well in advance, and arrive 5 minutes early, requesting a side window view, as this is much better than a front view, see photos. Dress code is smart casual to fine dining the choice is yours, but certainly no T-Shirt, shorts and flip-flops.When you arrive, take your time. You can arrive well in advance of your booking time, and take the chance to look around the hotel lobby. There are several shops to browse through, and many great photo opportunities within the hotel.The Sky View Bar reception is on the 1st floor (not ground floor) up the escalators, so just before your reservation time, go to the booking desk, and let the receptionist know you have arrived. The Sky View Bar is located on the 27th floor, 200m high, so if you don\u2019t like heights \u2013 be prepared. Access from ground level can be via the rear glass elevator, which gives unrestricted views of the ocean as you ascend, or if you prefer, travel in the closed elevators \u2013 just ask the receptionist at check-in.After you are escorted to your table, your server introduces him/herself and presents you with the menu, after which you are offered a glass of fine champagne, very nice. Our server was Tejas, who seemed genuinely happy to be with us, and looked after our every need \u2013 thank you Tejas. If you have any allergies etc., let your server know, he/she will be happy to modify the menu to accommodate.The menu not only details the courses to come, but also a beverage listing. All non-alcoholic beverages are included within the price, and you can have as much as you like, and as many different beverages as you would like to try. Just order when the mood takes you. Alcoholic drinks are also listed, and are an additional cost, which of course includes further glasses of champagne. Try the \u201cTale Of Two Hearts\u201d cocktail, very fruity and delicious.A small selection of fresh date\u2019s are already on the table as a taster. After the champagne, a white chocolate and apple pot was served. This was more like a dessert, but still very good. Afterwards, a warm ratatouille tart was brought. Although the courses are small single portions, they can be very filling. We are then served with a selection of sandwiches, crusts removed and very fresh. If you are still feeling hungry, you can request more, though your server will ask you in any case.To cleanse your pallet, lychee & rose sorbet is served. Then came our favorite, homemade scones & clotted cream and a selection of mini patisseries. Again, your server will ask if you would like any more, and will happily serve additional items of your choice.You can then complete you afternoon tea with a hot beverage, I would recommend any of the coffee\u2019s, they smell divine, and taste just as good. The final part of the experience, the ladies are presented with a single red rose, though this could have been due to the date we visited (Valentines Day).My wife and I thoroughly enjoy our time here, having done it twice already, and pre-booked again for August this year, it\u2019s a truly magical experience. Our total price (for February 2016) was 1695AED, though we did have additional champagne and two amazing cocktails. It sounds expensive, but for 2 hours of pure luxury and indulgence, it\u2019s well worth the price. Remember, its Dubai, it\u2019s the Burj-Al-Arab.Tipping is of course up to you, so depends entirely on your personal experience.Points to note: you will find that if you have a window table offering an amazing view, other people will want to experience the same, and will not hesitate asking you to move while they take pictures, it can be a bit frustrating.One Final Point, as you are already within the hotel, you can walk around the grounds, take your time and explore. I suggest you do this AFTER your tea, since it will be very warm and humid. Taxis will be available as you exit the hotel entrance, with the porters very happy to assist you."

The interior is different from anything I've ever seen before and the service from the staff is excellent.

Our high tea was very satisfying 5 courses and they thankfully allowed us to have as many sandwiches as we could eat.

Our afternoon tea was held in the sky view restaurant on the 27th floor, affording a wonderful view of the sea beyond. The tea itself consisted of champagne and local dates, then a small veg tart, a selection of sandwiches then a palate cleanser of a sorbet. For sweets we were served a selection of scones with jams, mini cakes and patisserie items. Unlimited teas, coffees and cold drinks were also offered throughout. A lovely experience even if indulgent, I would recommend this to others if looking for a treat whilst in Dubai."

Entering the hotel, one can feel the glamour of the place from the waterfall and aquariums. A quick look up of the ceiling also reveals interesting architectural pattern. On the way to the elevator to go up to the bar, one can enjoy the mosaic design on the floor. For my taste, I feel the decor is a bit mismatched overall. The outside is grand of course and the hotel is one of Dubai's icon. The bar itself is not cosy. The blue and green light really bothered me. And given the minimum spend per person, I ended up \"forced\" to order a glass of 2005 Dom Perignon. Something that I would not usually do. I am not complaining though...I enjoyed every drop. This is not something I would repeat on every Dubai trip, but it is interesting to experience once."

            "review": "Checked this one off my bucket list with Easter brunch. Expensive, but a lovely afternoon.. For years, during stopovers in Dubai with Emirates airlines, I admired the architecture of the the Burj Al-Arab.and dreamed of going inside - placing it firmly on my bucket list of things to do in my lifetime. For varying reasons, it took its time in working out...for either I thought I was dressed too casually when I was in the neighborhood or I hadn't made reservations enough in advance, etc. etc. In retrospect, I should have done it 13 years ago when it was much easier and less expensive to go in for a simple afternoon tea or a drink. As years went by, entrance for those who were not hotel guests became more difficult and considerably more expensive. That said, I finally made it in 2013 for a birthday with a big round number. I decided to make Easter particularly special and dine in there for Easter brunch. This time, I wrote and reserved at the Al Muntaha restaurant on the 27th floor of the Burj well in advance of my trip, so I could arrive in Dubai assured of a spot for my special occasion.The buffet was large and spread around various stations of the room, giving people plenty of room to circulate without causing too much congestion. There was a nice array of salads, light dishes, fruits and desserts. Alcohol was ordered and paid for separately. It was a beautiful day, and while our table was not by the window, we still enjoyed a lovely view out over the water and part of the coastline.My final evaluation and observations? I had wanted to mark my trip and this landmark year in my life with a visit inside this iconic monument, and I thought that the day and the brunch turned out very well. I am very glad that I did it and considered the price worth it - for me and my \"needs\" at that time (note: to date, it is the most that I have ever paid for a meal). However, it is nevertheless good to keep one's expectations in check.I strongly advise visitors on a tighter budget to read the comments of various travelers to understand clearly what to expect and to determine if this visit will meet their expectations.Stated truthfully, I am not as big a fan of the interior design or lobby (which is not at all reflective of the exterior), but I am nevertheless very glad to have seen it. With all of the windows, the restaurant on the 27th floor was nice, spacious, filled with light and airy...and who among us doesn't enjoy a view of the sea?As for the food, there were some solidly good options, but overall, it was not extraordinary, nor among the best meals I have ever had. Yet this evaluation will always depend upon the visitor's point of reference. For those who live in a major European capital and enjoy some of their city's best restaurants, their criteria may differ slightly or greatly from those who live elsewhere. That said, I truly enjoyed the day, my meal and the time there...and I do not regret having made that decision.Note: it is my understanding that the Burj offers the choice of several restaurants and lounges in different locations throughout the building, but I can only comment on the buffet of the restaurant on the 27th floor.Would I go again? If someone invited me or if I was with someone who had a special occasion that they wanted to celebrate there, then of course. I would also return if they would make it easier to go up for a simple drink, such as a glass of wine. In the absence of those things, I will probably use my money to try out other restaurants and experiences on the city's ever expanding list of things to do. Dubai is pretty incredible in that respect, and my short visits always seem jam-packed.***Visitors should always check the latest updates for information on eating establishments and options for entrance if you are not a guest, in addition to the latest pricing. Do not rely on what is stated in a travel guide from previous years."

Unfortunately, you must have business there to gain admission. This is easily accomplished by booking a reservation at one of the restaurants. I recommend Friday brunch at Al Muntaha, the cantilevered restaurant high atop the hotel. The buffet is superb, if pricey, and you can spend all the time you want exploring the hotel itself...well worth the price of the buffet. We've been back every time we visit dubai."

Of course, my wife, daughter and my daughter's best friend were immediately blown away when I surprised them and pulled up to the hotel. Upon arrival, we were royally received, and, after the requisite photos, immediately taken to our butler station to check-in on the 2nd floor where our two bedroom suite was located. When we were shown our suite, we felt like we had just stepped into the residence of a tycoon-millionaire. Everything was simply perfect down to the last detail--the plush carpet, the brilliant and rich fabric on the furniture, the tile and exquisite murals in both bathrooms, the gold and marble bar, and the tremendous size of the two level suite was simply spectacular. And, the restaurant choices, spa and fitness center, and the pool area adjacent to delightful cafe with both inside and outside dining all added to aura of our briefly indulging in the life-styles of the rich and famous. The surreal dream may have ended at checkout, but those 24 hour memories will last a lifetime."

We didnt leave the room apart from going to the pool and Wild Wadi and had all our meals sent to the room of course.Everything is very garish and gaudy but very tasteful.

You will be treated like royalty at your afternoon tea. And there is plenty of things to eat and lots of it. Some drinks are included in the tea deal. Ask for a window table. The view is outstanding."

They refer to it as a 7* hotel but in reality it can only be classified as a 5* hotel despite its opulent and extravagant fittings and furnishings. We had not made any reservations and as it was the festive season, they were heavily booked.Thus we were not able to gain access into the hotel. But I will make it a point to make a reservation in time on my next visit which I hope to make in December 2016."

The bar is astonishing with a nice ceiling. The view to Palm-island is nice. Then the high-tea. Again nice staff and ofcourse a lot of cakes, cholate, bread, juice, tea, coffee and champagne.

Delicate sandwiches amazing cakes. All served by your own butler. After tea we were guided around the hotel and was able to enter the restaurant at the top of the Burj. We stood and looked out over the city to its amazing views. We had a fab time. Make sure to look out for the celebs that are staying there. All in all beautiful. Not expensive,just what you would pay at the Ritz. Treat your self. Kids allowed too."

            "review": "High Tea @ SkyView Bar. First and foremost by no means I am writing this review to say that the hotel is not great or doesn't deserve to be a 7 star. Its a great sight to see a great building and interiors are very well done and well maintained. Hotel is spot less and makes you want to just stand and admire it for hours.Building, decoration, beauty, location, beach etc every thing is splendid.Now I would like to give my detailed and most honest experience of the much talked about AFTERNOON TEA which me and my partner recently had at the famous SKY VIEW BAR and felt that's where the service fell short of what I had expected after reading about in some of the online reviews.1) SKY BAR - It is one of the best bars I have been to and the strategic placement of this bar on a higher level with the view of ocean in front actually makes you feel like you are sailing in the ocean while having a great high tea at a 7 star hotel.Decorated with lots of hues of blue and swanky washrooms of this bar will make you feel that your decision of spending 1500 dirham (for two including cab rides, cover charges and a small tip) is well worth it. This bar would be almost full with like minded people (cant say if any in house guests were there as every one who came in with us...left with us) who want to experience the worlds only 7 star just like you so keep in mind it can be a busy day for the staff which ultimately can lead to them rushing you through the high tea and not delivering a great service, like it happened to us. If you are expecting to have a look at the property from inside as many of the blogs and other reviews talk about...then the answer is NO! From a relatively small lobby (filled with Chinese tourists click pictures madly) you will take an escalator to a level where you will meet the hotel staff to direct you to the sky bar.A fast paced glass elevator will directly take you to the sky bar and that is basically what you can see for the day. Same route will be followed on your way back so still no extra access to see and admire the only 7 star.2) HIGH TEA - At 620 AED per person you will go through a 5 course high tea.This tea experience will last for about 1.5-2 hrs and you will be served some great and some not so great bite sized foods. If you are a diabetic or a weight watcher this high tea is not for you as most of the courses are an over load of sugar which you will not be able to finish.Dates and champagne were OK to start with. Severs looked happy serving us till this point and we definitely felt welcomed. In case you are not a beef eater and don't prefer duck they will suggest you a vegetarian dish so feel free to ask. I was served a cold lasagne which was OK. Green apple creme brulee with white chocolate was awesome. Sandwiches were also not bad and you will be asked for a refill of sandwiches by a server carrying a big tray loaded with sandwiches (I found it quite odd). I would suggest holding on at this course to save some appetite for next courses.In the beginning staff will tell you that you can order as much drinks as you would like from a set menu and then you will not be able to catch them to take your order. Once you get hold of them for your order they will take half hour to bring your drink.What we did not like was when we orders the second round of our drinks we got clear reactions from the servers that they were not pleased.This time our drinks took 45 mins! So basically you can only have 2 drinks in your duration of stay there and I would recommend trying their Iced latte caramel (best one I have had till date) and Rose bud tea.Lychee & Rose sorbet was again an over dose of sugar and was not at all enjoyed.It was so sweet that I just tasted it and was done with it in first bite.A selection of pastries and scones will be served which I again found to be ok...nothing great about them which I can mention.By this last course the server clearly looked rushed and just want to clear up our tables asap so that we can go and a new batch can come in. This attitude is understandable as the servers might be bored with serving people that too every half hour when a new table comes in (they have booking slots every half hour and every thing seems very time calculated which doesn't let you relax and enjoy) with new guest with high expectations.We settled our check and left. Some guests were given packets with chocolates or cookies (I had read that they give you a small box of chocolates or cookies on your way back to be taken with you) but we were not offered this and dont know what the reason could have been. There were some who came out with packets and some with none so cant say what the criteria was.Will I go back to the hotel? - YES, but for staying.Will I repeat this high tea? - NO! Neither the service nor the canape are worth repeating.Is this high tea worth the money? - NO! this much money can get you so much more in Dubai. There are many hotels and restaurants which do high tea.I guess the only attraction for this hotel is that its a self proclaimed 7 star.Hope this review helps others who are in two minds if they would like to put this much money into this high tea or no.Thanks :)"

You are paying for the experience and the amazing service. Our waiter brought us over nibbles and kept replenishing which was really nice. He was. very knowledgeable about the cocktails and helped us pick some great choices.If you are visiting Dubai you need to visit this hotel. It really made our holiday very special."

This is a good alternative, although quite a bit more expensive. Still much less than staying a night...An inordinate variety of food (all you can eat), even more than expected. I don't frequent incredibly upscale restaurants that often, so perhaps I'm not as picky/demanding as some other people. I tried salad, lobster, numerous Indian dishes, sushi, Wagyu beef, and a few others (small amounts of many things), and I had no complaints about any of it. There are scores of desserts as well for the chocolate or sugar fanatics.Atmosphere was very nice, with live piano/cello going on. I wasn't able to get a window seat, but generally people don't mind if you wander to a window to take in the views or get some photos. The brunch is a must-try in my opinion."

Instead of doing the Afternoon Tea which so many so, instead we discovered a spa package which was on special at the time for 695 dirham. We got to spend the whole day at hotel, starting off with the infinity pool on the 18th floor overlooking the Palm and had the place to ourselves. Next we were brought to our treatments rooms on the 19th floor with floor ceiling windows again, overlooking the Palm. My massage was THE best I have ever experienced. After our massages we were then shown to a relaxation room where we could have some tea and juice, before being brought to the Assawan Lounge where we were given a full High Tea - seemed to be the same as the Afternoon Tea to me. After this we then had access to the BAA private beach for the remainder of the day where we were spoilt with cold facecloths, ice, cold water and Burj ice-pops!Am heading back in April and am considering doing this package again!"

The 7 course afternoon tea was amazing, champagne lovely and more than enough to eat and drink for the three hours we were there. Even had to bring some home in a box. My husband enjoyed a complimentary birthday cake too.We will visit next time for cocktails.The only negative thing was as we were leaving. We were totally overlooked by the door staff on several occasions whilst we looked for transport. The gentleman who wanted the white rolls and the other couple who were known to the staff were dealt with, absolutely no acknowledgement to us. In the end we stepped out and flagged our own transport down. That was a shame as otherwise an amazing afternoon."

Initially we were seated where the view was limited, but without even asking he arranged for us to be moved where the nighttime view was breathtaking .Although expensive , it's an experience well worth having."

The lobby was fantastic, the reception was fantastich and even the elevator up to the restaurant. Very friendly staf, a good meal and very very high prices of wine, which i will never forget.

Aside from the construction taking place near the entrance, the Persian Gulf in the background, the sounds of the white Rolls Royce's, black BMW 7 series, black Mercedes S Class arriving to drop off or leaving to pick up guests the exterior was silent. The entrance is lined with paintings of the Dubai Royalty, as you enter the grand foyer you look up to see what mimicked sails from a boat as the inner balconies. Below there is a cascading waterfall flanked by the reception and concierge desks.On each side of the waterfall are escalators to take Burj Al Arab guests to there suites unless you are privileged to have arrived by helicopter and ushered down the private elevators. At the top of the landing is a fountain and several shops to purchase gifts such as a diamond covered soccer ball or diamond covered hand gun.Our breakfast started as scheduled with our personal waiter there to describe the various delicacies on the menu. Arab and Indian cuisine prepared for the palates of the elite just waiting to be consumed. The flavors of such unique foods created with Sheiks and Sultan's in mind were there for us to eat. Our breakfast dining area gave us a view out of the front of the Burj Al Arab, revealing the waters of the Persian Gulf just in front of the nearby wave shaped Jumeriah Hotel. In the midst of breakfast a quartet of musicians played sweet music as we received our meal. This was undoubtedly one of the highlights of our time in the United Arab Emirates, this self proclaimed 7 star hotel is truly worthy of the claim."

The following 6 courses featured speciality sandwiches, macaroons, cakes etc. The flavours and presentation were spectacular, with each course explained as it is served. There is of course a wide choice of teas to accompany the lovely food. The surroundings are luxurious and the entrance had been decorated with a Christmas theme at the time of our visit. WOW! and that was before we even saw the full height fish tanks alongside the elevators!

They will have your name on their list, else you don't get in!My biggest surprise on entering the hotel was that it is hollow inside, you can see right to the top inside, with the rooms down both sides, and light shines through that curved shape towards the land.You then go to a private reception just for the Skyview, and give your name, and you wait until called by name to enter one of the two lifts, two couples at a time. Get there early if you want a window table, it's then just stunning. You get called to the lift in the order that you arrived. At the top of the lift you are received by another person and wait a few moments in a seat until someone else then escorts you to your table. We had a wow view, see the pics!The server then introduces him/herself and explains everything in great detail.Hint - when its the sandwich course, you will get offered more, don't take them, there are about 7 courses, and you will be full without taking extra sandwiches, unless you have a huge appetite!The tiered trays you get served with are shaped like the hotel!You get a presentation box at the end with luxury chocolates and a Burj pen.The whole experience is just exceptional, especially so if you get a window seat overlooking the Jumeirah hotel end, you can see towards the city from that end.It costs about \u00a3120 per person, but what an experience!"

            "review": "Memorable Seafood Experience. One of my most expensive and memorable dining experience is of Al Mahara Burj Al Arab , we went there few years back. What a beautiful setting under the Aquarium. Calm atmosphere, dine with a view of Aquarium where water creatures are busy in their world. Dark and dim restaurant setting and colors goes just in accordance to their Aquarium theme. We had a complimentary dining for two. We were treated with extra care and attention by their well trained team /staff. They ensured from us whether we were allergic to any kind of sea food. Staff asked twice before serving any of the food items . They served us many things before our final order . I would say mini food souvenirs from the sea like caviar , certain pastes or combinations and mini servings made out of sea food etc whose names I honestly forgot \u2026. So we tasted many starters before the main meal. Although small in quantity , I felt filled up with those mini tasters.  The main focus of attraction was our main dish , we took advise from the staff and I think he suggested us the best from the menu. It was a big platter of mixed sea food, and quite expensive one ! After that you don\u2019t need to order anything separately . Actually It was the special dish being served in that particular week when we dined. But without being stuck up in the long and complicated list of menu it was a very good decision , we enjoyed our food with everything on our big sumptuous platter one for each of us, we could not even finish it all. Over all a very good and filling dining experience.We did our sweet ending with a mixed serving of small dessert bites which were are all too delectable !Burj Al Arab has a magnificent interior. Bright colors are used in furniture and flooring , Arabic styled d\u00e9cor. A very interesting setting !"

We were a group of 17 and visited this place for morning breakfast.From the very start our group was literally ignored and not attended to nicely.About the food: We all ordered for vegetarian food. 1. There was just too less to choose from. In-fact in the main course there was just parathas and another choice of south indian (idly + dosa). Apart from this there was just juice, fruits and some bread. 2. The taste was very bad. We had our expectations high since this was a Luxury Hotel and we expected top class food here, to be honest giving the food average also would be unfair, it was bad.We reached on time but the service was very bad, we were unattended for quite sometime, for e.g. we had ordered for a coffee and didn't get it even after 4 reminders to the staff, it was only when we started to make a fuss about their service that they noticed and then also the manager comes and defends their staff and didn't apologise. The staff was so bad, they didn't have the courtesy and manners just to accept that they lacked on service on that particular day. We had to fight for about 2 hours just to get this down their minds. It was only when the senior officials stepped in and apologised.In they end they offered us some monetary discount on our bill and offered a complimentary tour of the Burj Al Arab.Even though the senior staff did solve the situation in the end, I would strongly recommend to visit this place just from the outside, and then be on your way."

We had dinner in their fish restaurant.First disappointment: the main fountain was not operating. This fountain makes up for 50% of the charm of the lobby, so when it's dry the lobby is way less impressive.We were early for our reservation, so we thought we would go up the elevator, to have a view from the panoramic restaurant. We were denied access to the elevator. So we had a cocktail in the bar of the lobby. The lobby is currently facing a gigantic construction sit, so much for the view.We finally went to the restaurant, difficult to find because not very well indicated. When I entered the dining room of the restaurant, one word immediately cam to my mind: feet. The dining room smelled like feet. Oh, and the wine menu is ridiculously expensive."

The first floors hides some shops but at the end of the hall two kinds ladies will welcome you. Once accepted and only if you are on the list you will be allowed access to the elevator. This will be your second life time experience. The elevator goes up at the seaside if the hotel and allows views onto the sea whilst going up.In a few seconds you will step out and into the sky view bar, with lights in the ceiling and a long streching bar. A waiter will help you to your table.It became a problem for us once he found out our daughter wasnt 21 and as we had no ID's they were nearly refusing us entrance.It was because we had a table next to a rope which devided the restaurant area from the bar that we could anjoy our excursion in this fabulous place.After the high tea , it tooks about two hours all together, we had a look outside where the most fantastic cars were parked and self proclaimed rich and famous were walking in and out."

Yes, this is a pricey experience, but one you will always remember."

The cocktails were excellent and the presentation of the ones we chose breathtaking(I had one where dry ice was poured around it/the wife got her cocktail in a handbag(like a tea pot) with a lipstick made of a jelly substance with little makeup jars with flavorings so she could make her own concoction ;-). You also get finger food with savory nuts included.It was worthwhile as you can walk around the hotel and the lifts and bar area itself is impressive. They only allow access to the hotel if you have a booking, if not a resident!The views were limited to the city lights which we cool however the day time experience would offer great sea views but we had that every day from our hotel room so chose the nighttime option!"

The entrance (especially at Christmas) is a wow, there were six of us myself, my sister and her adult kids and their partners and we all walked in and just stood there taking it all in, really is wonderful the pictures we took do not do it justice. We had booked the drinks package which was great value and mentioned when booking that it was a treat for my sisters birthday and they produced a cake for her. The waiter produced a special cocktail for my nephew as he couldn't decide what to go for and then said they were moving us to a better table and took us to one of the best tables with a wonderful view over Dubai. Was definitely one of our highlights of the trip to Dubai, the Burj Al Arab is one of the most beautiful hotels I have visited and the staff are courteous and polite and if ever back in Dubai would put it on my list of places to visit again."

It is pricey, food quality is just average, service is quite good. I'm trying to give feedback to the hotel and not just the restaurant. As a day visitor I would say it is a good thing to see the interior of the hotel. If it is something worth doing then it is really up to the person who wants to see it. You can view most of the pictures here but paying AED 355 for an average buffet just to get a glimpse of the hotel lobby is basically a personal choice. Some might say it is overprice but for some it is an experience worth paying for just to see the hotel inside. After all, it is one of the symbol of Dubai."

It took nearly 15 minutes before someone came over to give us a menu and glass of champagne. The service was very slow and nothing more than I would expect at a chain restaurant.

Surprising then that there are only 2 ladies toilet cubicles and signs saying use the showers on the actual beach and please don't use the toilet to get changed.. No signage telling you where to privately freshen up or change (there are sets of 1 male & 1 female changing cubic, every couple of hundred meters on the beach). Dirty toilets with no soap, no loo roll, 1 snoozing attendant who was fast asleep with her feet up. Her purpose I have no idea... What's the point of living in such an expensive place when it's set up is so rubbish.. I prefer Singapore which is a millions times better in terms of planning and facilitiesWe walked down the beach to the BAA but the Guards won't let you in unless you have a reservation in the hotel. Will have to book a table in the bar and go back to check out the view. Horrendously busy so no taxies to flag, we walked to the Souk nearby and tried to get a cab there.

Despite booking well ahead of the day, requesting a window table, and receiving an email from the hotel with an assurance that they would \"do their utmost to make this occasion special and memorable\", we were shown to an inside table with restricted views.The sandwiches were bland and we sensed that the staff were simply going through the motions.

I have been to many hotels in Dubai having been there numerous times over the last 13 years and this is by far the most lavish.

We staid at the jumerai beach hotel for one night and we love the hotel with a great view of the Burg el arab from each room, as well as the fact we could walk in the uniterrupted gardens of the hotel complex along the beach, still looking at thr Burg along the way.

It's 620 dirhams per person so about \u00a3120 each which is a lot for afternoon tea however it is so worth it. we went for the 4pm booking as this way you can see the sunset. One tip is that you should get there at least 30 minutes beforehand and let the receptionist at skyview know you have arrived. Then she will write your name down and you can go and take pictures in the opulent lobby before you go back to the waiting area. It's first come first serve so this will mean you will get a window seat as you'll be taken up first. I don't see the point in not having the window seats especially if you're paying so much, It starts with a glass of champagne along with some dates which were lovely. We then had a Duck and foie gras pie, followed by finger sandwiches, sorbet, and then cakes and scones. You can ask for more sandwiches if you'd like. The food is gorgeous and does fill you up for the whole day. You can have as many hot drinks as you'd like and the tea menu is quite extensive. Views are stunning and they even give you a rose and box of chocolates as a gift. I was also given a cake because it was my birthday. The washroom even had Hermes products that you could use.The staff were lovely and took lots of pictures when we asked.I thought there would be a strict dress code, so we dressed nicely in dresses and heels etc however saw some people in flip flops. this is a must do when in Dubai!!"

I had the opportunity to visit my friends in Dubai recently so grabbed the opportunity to book afternoon tea here. There are 2 places in the hotel where you can have it - the Skyview Bar or Sahn Eddar. The difference is that one is obviously much higher in the building and the views are better and the other is above the lobby area. I attempted to book the Skyview Bar option but this was fully booked and therefore went for the Sahn Eddar option. I have to say that from start to finish I thoroughly enjoyed it. The service was impeccable....the 7 courses were varied and delicious.....oh not forgetting the glass of champers at the start!.....you can have refills of teas/coffees throughout your visit. The view from the Sahn Eddar is also lovely - overlooking the entrance, the beach and the impressive Jumeira Beach Hotel. The cost is \u00a3110 each which I know sounds a lot - but let's face it - you're not going to do it every day! - I loved it and would highly recommend doing it if you are in Dubai!....I actually want to go and do it again...."

We were given arabic coffee and dates. We waited in the reception to get our turn to go up by the escalator to our restaurant . The waiting period was really enjoying moment because in and around us beautiful natural flowers were found decorated with colourful look and fragarance. While going up in the escalator, we can enjoy the marvellous water fountains and fantastic decorated wall by the side of us. Wow....Then we went to our restaurant and we had our breakfast. There also we were taken care of by the supervisor and the serving staffs very well. First time we ate the foods served in silver platters and silver spoons. We can never forget in our life. Then we enjoyed the dancing fountains in the same floor.Ofcourse we visited the skybar and the hotel rooms outside the corridors. We visited the washrooms .Even the water pipes were gold plated I believe. Me and my friends will never forget the visit to Burj Al Arab. When we came out of the hotel,we could see and take photographs of world's costliest cars like Rolls Royce . This hotel is Iconic symbol of Dubai I feel. Though the booking is expensive, it is worth spending our time and money because it is an experience---the height of richness. I would recommend all to take a visit .Thanks to UAE government and the ruler of Dubai."

She took the time to converse with us and the waiters Hussain And Roshem were equally helpful and made conversation .

The food was well presented and delicious. Towards the end of the meal we decided to take some pictures next to the beautiful decorated Xmas tree. The reception staff reluctantly took our picture and rushed us out quite quickly then we were assisted into the Lexus to take us home. The taxi driver was extremely rude, had no idea where he was going and on a number of occasions shouted back at us when we tried to explain the hotels location! He then handed us his phone to find the location and stopped the car on the motorway to find cluster p. As a taxi driver for Burj Al Arab, this is extremely uncalled for and unacceptable. The amount was more than double what we paid to get there and the experience ruined the night"

The atmosphere was also something special. The lobby is really worth seeing although bit fantasy style. There was a harpist playing creating a comfortable environment. Also the service was excellent and in-line with the aristocratic feeling you easily get in a place liike this. Recommended to people enjoying the small special moments in life.

Before the Burj Khalifer was built, this was the iconic building of Dubai, and for those who appreciate beauty more than size, still is the iconic building itvwas meant to be. It unfortunately does itself much tourist harm by making the price of going up it, even relative to the expensive price of Burj Khalifer (see our seperate review), ridiculously expensive. In the absence of a public viewing platform, the only way is to pay a ridiculous AUD233 per person for a 7 course afternoon tea in their sky cafe. Don't fall for the cheaper afternoon tea in their other cafe - it's on the ground floor in the lobby, access to some of which is free!The view from the Burj Al Arab is priceless for its proximity to The Palm development. Othervthan seeing it from the air, you won't see the shape of the palm from anywhere else unfortunately. Worth the high price? We didn't think so.So the remaining challenge is to find the best spot from which to get a good view & photo of the beautiful exterior of the building. Whilecwe don't know if we found the best spots, we found a couple of good ones:* Riding the monorail up the stem of the Palm to the Atlantis resort gives you a good view, but only brief as there are highrise buildings blocking the view as you go along* An excellent view and photo opportunity can be had from the beach-end of Jumeira Madanat (or similar, meaning the Mall).* Another good view is obtained by catching the RTA ferry from Pier 7 of Dubai Marina. They do a run at 11am, 3pm & 5pm which goes outside the marina and either around the outside of The Palm or under the bridge linking the Palm to the mainland if seas are rough. Either way, the 60-75min trip offers a good view of the building from the water.(If this review has been helpful, please click the helpful button)"

The service was so bad unless you drive a Bentley or Ferrari. When I drove to the lobby area in a \"normal\" car, no one came to greet you or opened the doors or offered valet services. The valets were just chatting with each other and I had to stand there for five minutes until they walked towards me to give me the valet ticket. This was only the beginning of the overall bad service. I then went to the Skyview Bar on the 27th floor and seated at my reservation for the afternoon tea. The server was nice in the first hour, but he didn't even ask us for the choices of tea until we told him. Later we asked him to take a picture for us and he showed some impatient. We are aware of that the next seating is at 4pm so we are not supposed to stay later than that. But as soon as the time passed 3pm, the server will rush the desserts to the table, even though we are still working on the sandwiches. Immediately after, he brought the last \"gift\" to the table, which suggested that we should leave soon. By the way, the gift is a box of cheap chocolate and a plastic pen that I didn't even pack into my luggage traveling back. We had not received ANY service afterwards, and the server never stopped at our table to ask if we need anything. He didn't talk to us until I asked for the check, and he didn't even offer coffee at the end. I left the hotel with only disappointment. I'm so glad I chose the suites at Waldorf Astoria at the Palm Jumeirah over the suites at Burj Al Arab. I cannot see or feel the luxury in this place, and many standard five-star hotels in US had done way better than it. I don't know if they treat everyone like this, unless you are wrapped in Louis Vuitton and Hermes, but due to my experience, I will avoid all business with the Jumeirah hotels. Lucky for me to know that before I give them the money for their resorts in the Maldives. I will certainly find another hotel for better services I will receive."

They have a sky bar at the 27th floor which is worth an amount which signifies the height and floor of that bar. What I am trying to say is that these details are very fascinating to know and live in the tour."

I have been in many of the beautiful hotels around the world including the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia; and I've never had such a disappointing experience in all my travel.I spent couple of days with my team. We booked 3 rooms.Upon arrival everything seemed perfect. The property looks very nice, just in the typical Dubai style, but there are a lot of problems.First It is in the middle of a major construction zone, so expect a lot of noise and beeping from trucking all day and especially all night long.The service at the restaurants has been incredibly slow, regardless of being often few or the only customers in the premises. The staff have been very apologetic about it, but they have not really been able to improve.We often waited for 1 hour to be served.Last night onward the entire place seems to turn into a big disco with blasting music up to 3am. The music coming from the bars was so loud that you would think to have speakers in your room!Even if your windows are closed.The staff could not really offer any solution because of no other availability.The hotel seems to be a hang out for prostitutes, they are everywhere. So it is very far from your typical Emirates environment.Overall it was a very disappointing experience! The only affinity to the Burj Al Arab experience is the cost.I certainly would not recommend it to any one especially to a family.If I was His Highness Al Maktoum, I would not associate my good name to this establishment. Marbles, colours and high finishing are not all to be a 7 Stars Hotel."

The lobby was beautiful and there was an aquarium by the escalator. We arrived earlier than our reservation and was asked if we wanted to look around or sit and wait. We then went and explored around. It was expensive with a 350 AED minimum spend per person but was definitely worth it to see the hotel. They inform you of this when you make a reservation on the phone so it is not a surprise. Staff were great, helpful and friendly. Enjoyed three cocktails here, all were great and some complimentary snacks.My husband has a dairy allergy and they were still able to cater for him with complimentary snacks and bought him out some berries on ice.The view was amazing and we were very lucky to enjoy the view by the window. Was an amazing experience, would definitely recommend it."

I was slightly worried when I booked as we were a mixed age party ranging from 75 to 9! but I had no need to worry, there was something for everyone. This is no ordinary buffet! you name it they have it, seafood, meat, indian, pasta etc. Contact the hotel in advance an request a window table, they can not guarantee it but if you are lucky to get one like us the views are wonderful.

As soon as we sat down we were greeted by the lovely members of staff and the menu was explained to us. Then the food started... it was lovely! All the courses we excellent although a little strange to have a dessert type course first before the savoury.

Excepting the technology in the room, which gives away its age. Although even this is now almost classic with its Tardis dashboard like appearance, so does not detract from the splendor. The hotel overlooks a mirage of Jumeirah Group properties, which are constantly being added to and enhanced, so the place always feels like it has something new to offer every time you visit and it really is the jewel in the crown for the hotel chain"

A room or restaurant reservation is required to get on the property, but its definitely worth every dime. With a restaurant reservation, we were allowed to roam around afterwards on the same floor, the hotel lobby, and around the hotel outside. The room reservation is very expensive, but meals here will also cost you a good penny. Breakfast at Sahn Eddar was about $125/person, but their was A LOT of food and all sorts of options. The views from where we were seated were amazing...worth every penny. Dinner at Al Muntaha was a so so experience. The food was mediocre and it costs about $230/person depending on what you order. My friend ordered steak and said it was the best steak shes ever had. I ordered salmon and was not informed that it didn't come fully cooked. Later when I discovered it was partially cooked, a staff member came out and apologized and offered to refund some of my money and offered us a free cocktail which was a very nice gesture. The hotel itself is very well made, an exquisite piece of architecture...the hotel and restaurants are definitely worth a visit :)"

We were really surprised by the atmosphere when we entered the hotel, and we were delighted to be able to wander around the public areas and take photographs before heading up in the lift to the Skyview bar on the 27th floor. The culinary flight takes the form of 6 courses (including cocktails and canap\u00e9s) in 6 different venues within the hotel. Yes, it's ridiculously expensive at over \u00a3800 for 2 people including wine pairing and tip, but for us it was a once in a lifetime chance to visit the BAA. Everything about the evening was perfect. The staff were professional yet extremely friendly, with several taking time to stop at our table to chat and genuinely take an interest in us. The food was faultless, fine dining at its best. It was presented beautifully and cooked to perfection. In each restaurant, a basket of bread (prawn crackers in Junsui) was presented along with dips, butter, olive oil etc. Portions were generous and so we had to pace ourselves (and resist the bread!) or we'd have struggled to manage all of the courses. We also opted for the wine pairing with each course, and water and soft drinks were also included. Our only negative comment about the whole evening would be about the smokers lounge situated next to Al Mahara. The smell of the smoke reached in to the restaurant. We are very strong 'anti smoking' and are both quite sensitive to cigarette smoke. It wasn't pleasant, especially walking past on the way in to and out of the restaurant. The whole experience took us 5 1/2 hours from start to finish, but in reality it felt much less than this. Time went very quickly and before we knew it we were enjoying our last course, dessert and coffee in Sahn Eddar. Being presented with a beautiful bunch of roses at the end of the evening was a really lovely touch. The whole evening was such a fantastic experience, I'd definitely recommend it as an extra special treat."

As non drinkers we didn't pick the wine pairing although the this was available. 5 out of the 6 courses were incredible. The cold celery soup course I'm afraid I couldn't stomach.The service was excellent and as it was our anniversary we were given a cake to take away.

Still no water. We ask again and also ask for some tea. The next course was a meat pie which is difficult to make look elegant. The chef clearly thought so too so didn't bother. The pastry was very good, but the filling (confit duck and fois gras) was repellent. The meat was grainy and sour tasting and there was a bitter red berry in there, I'm guessing cranberry or barberry, but it could have been a redcurrant. Nobody finished it and most of us wished we hadn't started it. Tea arrives, one pot of Assam and one Earl Grey, both lukewarm. The hostess passes our table so I tell her the tea is cold and could we have some hot. She tells me the tea is not cold. I assure her that it is. She tells me it is only cold because I have put a splash of milk in it. It is my fault the tea is cold. As we're paying over \u00a3500 for this I am beginning to find the whole experience a little irritating, but as my husband is not keen on scenes of any kind I take a bit of a walk and he secures fresh, hot tea. When I return there are scones, but not very good ones. These dense shiny discs had been made in a mixer that had been left to run far too long. The gluten had fully developed by the time they were shaped and then any hint of a rise was negated by an incredibly heavy egg wash. They were tough and gluey, but would have made a very strong supporting wall. Still no water. Two ladies wander into the tea taking area. They have clearly been spending money as they are carrying bags bearing the hotel logo. They want a peek at the view, but are shoo-ed away by a waiter, so we ask them to join us for a few minutes as we didn't think a look out of a window was much of a crime. They stay for a few minutes, are unimpressed by the scones and then leave before the swat team arrives. We decide to do the same and ask for the promised cakes, pastries and petit fours to be packed for us to take away. The box of cakes is handed to my husband along with the eye watering bill and, finally the water we asked for at the beginning. We gratefully leave. That evening we plan a sugary supper, but opening the box we discover cakes, for two people, no pastries and no petit four. We went out for a sharwarma instead, five chicken sharwarmas for under \u00a310, all hot, fresh and totally delicious. My children shared the cakes for pudding and assured us they were very good and I have no reason to disbelieve them. This whole experience was made all the more irritating by the fact that my husband and I had tea at The Burj on a previous visit to the Gulf and the food was excellent. This was to be a treat for our children, but just ended up a massive disappointment and a triumph of style over substance."

The bar is pretty cool and you get access to the inside of the building, but there is a 350 AED ($100 USD) minimum per person to get a reservation. That would seem like a lot, but that gets you 2-3 drinks and a tiny appetizer."

The room was exquisite, golden, blue and opulent, like a luxury town house, 2 levels with chandelier, fit for royalty. Even the television said welcome. Magnificent views of The Arabian Gulf. That moving staircase, whisking us upwards with a whole wall of swimming fish as a back drop. In the bar, drinks were horrendously expensive but to be savored. The mirrored ceiling over the bed, watching that view and the shadow of the structure superimposed outside in the water, the Hermes toiletries in full size bottles were ours to take home. The huge bathroom all in gold and robes to relax in at our own work station. Suffering jet lag, I succumbed to sleep. However my husband stayed up all night - to not miss one single moment.

It is worth going to the first floor and letting them know you are here, as they take people up in the lift in the order of arrival and you stand a better chance of gaining a seat by the window. We booked the later sitting as it gives you a chance to see the views by day and night, as well as the hotel at both times.Food is excellent and it includes a glass of champagne. Refills are expensive however you can drink all the tea and coffee you want. If it is a special occasion let them know as they bring out an extra treat. The views of the Jumeirah beach hotel I found were the best however you can wander around and rake pictures.Do dress up as it us a 7 star hotel and it is afternoon tea however not everyone does which I was surprised at.

Fortunately my Emirates limo glided up and was admitted with me and my battered suitcase in toe.Having just flown from SFO, I was not the picture of satorial elegance, but the 10 or so middle Eastern beauties who greeted me did not show their distain openly. My personal butlers whisked me to my suite on the 30th floor and showed me the ropes.If this is heaven, let me go there now! It is certainly not understated luxury, the luxury hits you from all angles, from the marble staircase from the living quarters to your sleeping quarters, to the spa, the electronic everything, and the BED!!!

However, the Burj Al Arab Hotel is a stellar stop-over if you do not mind spending some extra bucks for a day. The drinks--the wines especially-- are pretty expensive but the food and service is awesome. The staffs are friendly and the concierge is very assistive. The rooms are spacious and luxuriously decorated."

If you book for 1sh you will get a table by the window. When afternoon tea was finished we walked around the bar taking some photos and again the staff were very helpfull and made you feel relaxed.

We had two stays at this hotel during the Summer months, some good points some not so good.The rooms, they are definitely big enough and have plenty of gadgets. Large and comfortable beds and quality linen, Hermes toiletries if that pleases you but I prefer a good bar of carbolic soap.A semi free minibar, TV in the lounge and bedroom, computer and printer and a mirror on the bedroom ceiling to help you get a bird's eye view of yourself and companion?Each hotel floor has a dedicate concierge and butlers to cater for your every need. They seemed a little bit too eager for my liking and continually requested info on our plans. Maybe some guests will appreciate this type of suffocating service and consider it is being treat like Royalty but it got on my nerves. I prefer to go about my own business without being recognised and prefer a more relaxed service.Room hygiene is outstanding, the staff are discreet and flexible. Food, you have a few restaurants to pick from. Al Maha, Al Iwan, Junsui and Bab Al Yam. All have good service but the food can be hit and miss. I hate buffets! You cannot get hot food from a receptacle with a candle underneath it!Junsui is interesting, informative and well staffed.The sky view bar is worth a visit for a beer or two, a coffee in the lobby area is relaxing too.One big problem is the amount of day trippers The hotel is among the top tourist sites in Dubai. That says a lot about Dubai?You are slowed down by a constant stream of visitors taking photos, videos and selfies that have no thought about any one else's privacy. I think the hotel has the odd rule about videoing/photography inside but it must be impossible to enforce in such a popular tourist site. I suppose if was paying upwards of \u00a3100 for a scone and a cup of tea and wearing my most sartorial outfit I'd want a photo to prove it too! Getting in and out of the hotel is can be difficult when having to get through a photo shoot. you know when it feels impolite to walk in front of someone taking a family photo, its like that most of the day and night. Customer Questionnaires, why are they given out so often? Staff ask you to fill them in sometimes after every event. No doubt they want a good personal highlighting and they are concerned about any negativity. Come on, be yourselfI found some staff to be far too servile, too nervous and not relaxed. The hotel staff are people, not machines and definitely not minions. Let's see a bit of personality from the staff. The hotel is good but it lacks that touch of personality that other good hotels have.My wife loved the Burj Al Arab. I liked it, I would have liked it more if the staff actually looked like they enjoyed being there too,,,,"

When booking our trip to Dubai, afternoon tea at the Burj al Arab was the number one.. ok.. maybe two.. on our list of things to do (it was our honeymoon!) and we cannot say it disappointed.The hotel is elaborate, break taking and... quite surreal. Who knew you could jazz up gold by putting more gold on it? Then put it on a gold pedestal. And throw gold at is. Extravagant isn't the word.The afternoon tea experience was exceptional. Considering the large intake at tea time we never felt rushed, the food was deliciously filling and the staff were outstanding- it was a phenomenal experience that I would recommend to anybody and we'll certainly be returning. I recommend arriving 20-30 minutes before your booking to walk around the hotel and check in at the restaurant concierge promptly. You will then be called into an elevator from this list in groups of approx 8. Remember, those who rush into the elevator to beat you to it will, in fact, be the last out of the elevator. Take it slow, play it cool and you'll be first in line to the best table in a breeze."

The high tea, although not cheap, was absolutely wonderful. We were served French Champagne to start with, then your selection of (unlimited) fine tea (or coffee), followed by a magnificent stand (in the shape of the Burj Al Arab) full of small sandwiches, mini rolls, slices, cake and scones.

I ripped a dress before arriving and when enquired about the in-house tailor, she was in our room within half an hour, whisking my dress away to mend, then hand delivering it back the following morning, fixed, washed and pressed! fantastic service! We had afternoon tea in the sky bar which was also fantastic with views across the sea and to the burj khalifa. The hotel pool is being refurbished which was a bit inconvenient, but understand it needs doing and was informed it is hoping to be completed by dec15 and they are also working on adding a beach around the hotel island, which they currently dont have - this will be a real added bonus for the hotel. Whilst we stayed, we were taken in a buggy over to a private part of the beach opposite for burj guests where we were looked after all day with beach staff service. I had a pre-natal massage and a La Prairie Caviar Facial in the spa which was amazing, with views out the window over the palm. The spa facilities were fantastic. We dined at Al Mahara, which was a slight disappointment - the menu very small, with most items containing either raw seafood or foie gras which when pregnant makes the menu even smaller! we had a three course meal with water and two mocktails, which was nice but not the best we'd experienced out there, but was by far the most expensive (approx \u00a3400) Overall, this hotel is definitely 7* in service and room standards. The hotel pool and beach area will be much better once all the renovations are complete. We are already planning our return for next year, and I cannot wait. Given the chance, I would have moved in for good.... the rooms were big enough!!!"

It wouldn't have been complete without a visit to THE Burj Al Arab. Since hotel reservations or onsite restaurant reservations are needed for you to enter the property, we booked a breakfast at Sahn Eddar - the hotel eatery located on the 1st floor. It was a memorable dining experience.Everything at Burj Al Arab is over the top sophisticated, classy and gorgeous. The lobby interior is draped in rich colors and the architecture is breath-taking and like nothing I've never seen before. The service at Sahn Eddar was excellent. I don't think you rush when you dine at such an establishment. The wait staff is attentive; the presentation is impressive; and the food is very delicious and aplenty. We had the continental breakfast which included an entree choice, a variety of pastries, and drink of choice. It was expensive, no doubt about that. Breakfast was AED 350 a person (~$95) excluding gratuity. But if you find yourself in Dubai and it's not somewhere you would frequent, you just have to experience the \"only 6 star hotel in the world,\" wouldn't you?"

The food and views were amazing - a cake stand, the shape of the Burj, kept being filled up with lots and lots of goodies - coffees, teas, and even milkshakes were endless... jams i've never even heard of and delicate little cakes we're just to die for. On our return we asked for a golf buggy to take us back - a few seconds later the concierge called us over as a beautiful milk white Rolls Royce purred to the front door 'you're car madam' - 'but we were only waiting for a golf buggie' - 'there is not one available at the moment so please accept this car' - OMG - it was stunning and we loved it...

Expensive as it's the price of most high end Dubai brunches but a real treat or perfect for a special occasion. Unlike some afternoon teas in Dubai who should be shockingly ashamed, they provide endless tea and refill provisions until you say stop and that's what a good afternoon tea is all about. Al Qasr, one and only, address hotels and fairmont are high end afternoon teas who provide refills and top quality afternoon tea and should you not wish to pay 100pounds for high tea, they are my top alternative recommendations at a quarter of the price. Dubai has some awesome afternoon teas ....London is famous for the Ritz but it's standards have not reached Dubai..steer clear but until it reaches that standard....there are some amazing options for what I find is an amazing way to spend an afternoon with friends at great value for money."

A once in a lifetime possibility to get to the highest man-made place on earth (I believe 555meters above ground). You can get better prices by booking online in advance through other companies, but I don't think that gives you the fast-track possibilities, which allows you to pass all the long lines to get to the outside patio and the elevator back down to earth, which is almost worth the extra price in itself. We went up to see the sunset which was spectacular. Just try to time it to a day without haze/fog/clouds. We was a bit unlucky on that side, so the view wasn't as good as it could have been. Were treated to some local delights as dates, coffee, sweets, fresh juice etc which added to the overall experience!"

Book asap.Our booking was at 8.30pm in the bar which is pretty amazing but get ready to spend your money.Cocktails start at 160 AED+ and spirits start at 100 AED. Fantastic cocktails but when you convert them to AUD it is very luxurious $57 AUD per cocktail.

This is where we ended our honeymoon and what a place to have ended it this palace is nothing short of excellent. We stayed in the panoramic suite for four nights witch was not enough time the bed was like a silk cloud that was made up for you twice a day. The staff were magical so attentive from the bottom to the top. On every floor there was a 24 hour reception desk with butler service we stayed in room 1112. Our butlers names were Abdullah and Paul they were both amazing we did not have to lift a finger it was a real royal class service. Paul was particularly outstanding the attention he lavished upon us was incredible he offered to pack our bags for when we were leaving. There was a gift on our pillow every night and some chocolate, cakes, canapes and wine or champagne and clothes that you had left on the floor were neatly folded and put on a chair when they cleaned your room. if you were ever thinking of going stop thinking and just go because I am the type of person that is very hard to impress and The Burj surpassed all my expectations and beyond. What I did not mention was the first part of our honeymoon was three nights in Abu Dhabi Emirates Palace considered to be a seven star and seven nights in the Residence Maldives considered to be a six star, The Burj Al Arab blew them out of the water."

On arrival we were greeted by one of two gowned ladies - we weren't offered fresh towels or dates they had in their hand, neither were we asked if we needed directions.After admiring the gold leaf, fish tanks and fountains near the entrance we wondered where we should go for our tea so asked one of the lovelies by the door who told us we should head up the escalator. Once in the sky bar our waiter introduced himself ,noted that we had 2 diabetics & 3 vegetarians amongst us. He didn't explain the drinks menu ie what was included & what was chargeable, he served tea 4 courses in, so with the scones, until then we had champagne but no offer of water etc. He never came back to ask if we wanted a refill of tea or any other drink.The food was unbelievably boring & poorly presented: duck pie served with a bit of chutney, 4 types of sandwich filling - chicken paste, tuna paste, salmon paste and cucumber & cream cheese. The veggies & diabetics got an even worse deal. Pastries were solid stodgy lumps of Dundee cake, carrot cake etc. Most people left their food untouched.The atmosphere around us was not that of calm & serenity - waiters were hoovering, table cloths were being ironed and the blender was going off in the bar area drowning the sound of the pianist.We could not have felt more rushed by the serving team - it cost over \u00a3700 for the 6 of us for the experience and it was so disappointing. Worse still, my son in England arranged with the Burj to pay for our experience as a treat and he stressed so many times to them to not tell us he had paid until we asked for the bill - even this was rushed as we were advised he had paid during our sandwich course - another example of the rushing experience.It's such a shame as the afternoon tea experience at the Burj was meant to be the highlight of our trip to Dubai and something we had dressed up for and looked forward to for such a long time - spoilt by waiters & chefs thinking they are manning a production line and not caring that for some it's a once in a life time experience."

We didnt get a window table..dont think it matters...because you can get between the window tables to take any pictures.

The staff are lovely.We had champagne and sandwiches and pastries, cakes ,scones ,jam and clotted cream, tea coffee and unlimited non alcoholic drinks. We were sitting right at the window with an amazing view of the Palm. Also when leaving we got a lovely gift , a pen in a beautiful gift box with chocolates at the bottom. This was just an amazing day.It made our holiday special."

You enter the door and go up an escalator past the beautiful aquarium. The interior of the hotel is a wow factor. So much gold, deep carpets, fountains, lots of very polite staff.We were shown to our table. We had Tea, Scones with fresh Cornish cream (flown in daily) Sandwiches, and Cakes. All served by polite staff and as much as we could eat.We wanted a photograph but had to wait until no-one else was around us, in respect of other guests privacy.It was a lovely afternoon surprise. Yes it was expensive but we were treated so well and felt it was equal to Tea at The Ritz Hotel in London."

It takes a bit of planning to get in as you cannot just walk in unless you have a reservation either for a suite (known as a room in other hotels!) or for a meal. Apparently there are also tours of some sort to the hotel judging by the number of people of all nationalities being bussed in, taking photographs and then leaving.The inside is pretty impressive, but not something I would necessarily be prepared to pay extra for just to see. It capitalizes on its reputation, but I do feel that the reputation is being surpassed by other places already built in Dubai and elsewhere in the world.I was a bit excited about the idea of going there before I went, because of its reputation, but now that I have \"been there, done that\" I feel I could say that maybe it is worth a visit, but be prepared to pay for the privilege."

The burj Al Arab hotel is a very interesting and quite stunning exterior the very long drive up can make you feel you are entering somewhere very special once through the grand entrance it's a very busy and glitzy decor for me a little overdone in taste.. A lot of money spent but i wouldn't say in the best way but its different.. as you go up the escalator the whole wall is an aquarium to relax the visitor after their long flights there are also dancing fountains for our entertainment lots of red and gold paint around to give it the luxurious feel. good to see for a visit but i feel much too overdone but ok for a tourist attraction.typical Dubai hotel really has mainly Russian occupancy ultra expensive & all rooms are suites"

Every time I fly from the United States to Tabuk, Saudi Arabia where I currently reside, I now stay one night at the Dubai Intercontinental Airport Hotel to rest up and await my flight to Tabuk the following day. This has now become a habit. Once again there was someone from the hotel to greet me with my name sign and he escorted me to the hotel. My husband had paid for a junior suite for me and when I arrived in the room, well, there were several rooms in the suite, it blew me away! There was a massage chair, huge walk in shower, large sunken tub, a comfortable bed with down comforter and huge pillows that you just wanted to throw yourself down on it! There were two juice pitchers filled and plates of goodies! Top notch toiletries in the bathroom. A coffee maker that used the pods. Free water bottles and a mini bar which I did not use. I got room service for breakfast at about 2 a.m. when I woke up from my long nap, having checked in at 12 p.m. noon the previous day and it was fantabulous! I requested a wake up call for 8 a.m. because my flight left for Tabuk at noon. I never heard the phone ring, I was so tired and in such a deep sleep. At 8:15 a.m. one of the female desk staff came into my room and awakened me! Now that is going above and beyond the call of duty! I am also a smoker and though they did not have smoking rooms, they did, however have a smoking room next to the entry desk. When it came time to leave, one of the employees escorted me to the place where I would catch a bus van to get to the terminal I needed. The one thing you must remember is NOT to go through customs or exit the airport. The hotel is for transients only. For my next flight, my husband said he was going to get me a business suite! Regardless of the room size, you get top notch service! It is so very worth it if you have a lengthy layover."

When we arrived I was blown away by the hotel, although I find it completely over the top it was what I was looking forwards to. However when we got to the lifts up to the sky bar you had wait as they send you up one at a time. Which would be lovely if it was not a 15 minute wait with minimal seating. I am not sure why you would tell everyone to turn up at the same time for a sitting surely if you staggered this by even 5/10 minutes it would avoid this issue. - really disappointed by this. I am also a fussy eater. I know this but I don't make a big deal. They asked what we don't like which was nice and I gave a quick overview that I don't eat fish and cheese. Assuming that would be ok. Upon reading the menu I realised neither me or my partner would eat one of the courses so I said not to bother. However they sent up something they assumed we would like, which was a lovely thought. The issue came with the sandwiches. He mentioned a chicken one which I loved the sound of but never got and then replaced all the fish ones with veg ones that I do not eat but didn't feel the need to supply a full list of my eating. I didn't want to cause a scene but I asked where the chicken ones were. He mentioned because there was Mayo in there he didn't bring them. I asked for some none the less but he wouldn't agree. Then another man came and had the exact same conversation with me and I asked again to have them. In the end my partner had to but in and I was getting frustrated as no one was listening to me. Then a 3rd lady (the manager) came over and it started once again. At this point I just said I didn't want to talk about it. She offered us a free cocktail and we accepted. My issue was not that they wanted to fix this my issue was that I was made to feel like I was causing an issue. One then implying it was our fault for not specifying before hand (not sure where we were meant to do this as we were not asked prior). I was very embarrassed by this situation and it was upsetting. However they did turn this around the rest of the tea was beautiful and me and my partner were offer a tour of the hotel as an apology - amazing touch. Overall I think the problem was almost over service. They were trying to hard to please us which made me feel incredibly awkward and embarrassed. But they did turn it around and it ended up being a nice afternoon. Oh and the gift at the end was a lovely touch!I am glad I did this tea and have seen the hotel - but personal wouldn't need to go back under my own cost."

We had food at the Al Muntaha and to be honest it was very very overpriced for the quality of food served. Horizons restaurant at the Amwaj Rotana hotel served good food and suggest the chef at Al Muntaha pays a visit to see what good food is. Service and Greeting was average....... once again Horizons team at Amwaj Rotana can maybe assist you in some way."

Returning to it many years later it's hard not to notice the dated interior design which is still as kitschy today as it was at the opening. It still bills itself as 7 star, owing to the ratio of staff to guest I'm told. It's true the service is as attentive as ever, and there is still the impression that no expense is being spared to make the place stand out. That said, something has changed and it's hard to explain what. Maybe it's time for a renovation, simplifying down that extreme approach to interiors and giving it all a fresh look. Surely it will not ever fall off any dubai tourist itinerary any time soon, but somehow it feels like it could use a boost."

When came time to order another I asked for lemon and the server said \"you are changing now\"? I replied \"no it was always lemon\" and he then said \"you ordered lime before\" and then proceeded to argue with me! Not impressed.

We hired a Bentley to take us to the hotel and were warmly greeted by every member of staff we met. The reception was Grand and busy with lots of people taking photos, so we went up the escalator to the lifts for the Sky View Bar. Most people were given their own lift to travel the 24 floors, with fabulous views of the sea and the Palm. At the top we were greeted and seated efficiently with a view to take your breath away. We were asked about which champagnes we wanted and had the menu explained to us, all we had to do was sit back, relax and eat the many platters that were put in front of us! Finally we were invited to have cakes from the extensive selection!We cannot fault this Afternoon Tea, everything was excellent, nothing was below standard and we had a fantastic Anniversary afternoon thanks to the staff. We were not rushed at any time, and when we went back to the ground floor we were able to browse the shops and jewellers and purchase items in our own time!

Think of Ritz or something similar.We tried our luck the taxi took us to the security gate, it's not near the Burj Al Arab, if you want to just take photos you be wasting your time. I'm not here for photo's already seen the documentary of the beautiful place being built.We asked if we could go in for a drink and snack and they asked if we had reservation which we didn't and would like to book but they asked us if we were interested in afternoon tea. I know its not your average Starbucks or Costa.We went in and a golf buggy took us to the main entrance. After we went in on first floor we were greeted and took us to our table, for the next 4 hours or so we had Champaign sandwiches cakes and even minute steak meal. The experience was great the food and drink was out of this world. Was it worth it, well YES, I've paid more watching a football game (Chelsea FC Hospitality), figure skating, ice Hockey both Vancouver Olympics, even F1 Abu Dhabi 2014. This is one of my dreams come true. For 4 hours I was in the millionaire league.We even had live classical music."

Once you enter the lobby you are enticed by the Gold plated everything. The escalators are flanked on the sides with wall sized aquariums with a beautiful dancing water fountain between the escalators. The Concierge desk is staffed by a very friendly and professional staff. Everything about the hotel announces excellence and beauty from the dozens of flowers bouquets made up of miniature roses to the numerous Swarovski crystal pieces, to the vast array of colors and craftsmanship that went into the design of the hotel. Glass elevators take you to your floor were you will find your very spacious and luxurious room. Lying on the bed makes me wonder what lying on a cloud would be like. The rooms have beautiful views of Dubai and the Persian gulf. The hotel has several wonderful restaurants within but my favorite is the Al Muntaha which is at the very top of the hotel and is unbelievably gorgeous with the best food you will find anywhere."

We transferred on this occasion from the Atlantis hotel and called the Burj Al Arab in advance to see if we could check in early. They said this wouldn't be a problem but when we got there our room wasn't ready. This was the best part-as we got upgraded to a two bedroom suite! The rooms are breath taking. I have never stayed anywhere like it and although I'm writing this review 2 years later I can remember it like it was yesterday. We had a bathroom, study, 2 lounges and a kitchenette on the ground floor and two huge bedrooms with ensuites on the top floor. The floors were joined by a beautiful spiral staircase. This is luxury. The toiletries are all Hermes with aftershave and perfume included. Somebody is assigned to look after you and canap\u00e9s were brought to our room around 5pm. The pool area was quiet but we were well looked after. The staff found us sun beds and brought over a cool bag for us with water and other goodies. Personally, we prefer something less quiet so we headed over to the more private pool at the Jumeirah beach which has a lovely swim up pool and a more vibrant feel. The hotel were kind enough to extend our checkout by two hours free of charge so we really felt we made the most of our time there. I would highly recommend staying here for a couple of nights. One slight downside is that it is less conveniently placed than the Jumeirah beach so waiting for a buggy is a pain."

The staff are so attentive to your needs and throughout the time I spent all the staff and the service was second to none. The view from the floor was not so good on the first day as the visibility was not so good. There is a restraint on this 24th floor and the view out to sea is spectacular and looks out to the Dubai World set of Islands. The lunch was served on the ground floor restaurant where there was so much choice you could spend all day just eating.The views outside are complimented by the view inside the hotel colours are vibrant bright with a large aquarium on the ground floor when you walk in to reception. there are small dancing fountains close to the shopping area on the first floor. Where you can find the major high end retailers.Because of the security and restrictions to access this hotel you can only see it form the beach or the driveway. You need to have some special access/pass to get into the hotel."

Having the butler unpack for us was a \"challenge\" for my wife and she vowed in future to pack certain \"personal items of clothing\" in cloth bags. The whole stay of 10 days was sensory overload. All restaurants served excellent foods, all staff were brilliant, we had great fun with them. We tried almost everything in the hotel with the exception of the \"submarine\" to the Al Mahara underwater resturant - it was inoperable.We managed on two occasions to get tables right out on the edge of the Skyview Bar - breathtaking. When the girls saw where we sat in the Skyview from a suite on the upper levels, they blanched and swore never to sit there again - you are on the edge of the world.Most amazing room we have ever stayed in and it was the basic Duplex Suite.

This hotel is far the best I have stayed in around the world, All the rooms are suites and have amazing views.The service is 1st class in all parts of the hotel, breakfast was included in the package that I booked and the choice of food was outstanding, nothing is too much trouble to make if you have special requirements.The pools inside and outside are beautiful and clean with lots of lifeguards to watch over the children.The hotel is not cheap but is a must do at some point."

My friend and I stayed there on a guys trip to Dubai a couple of nites. The service - impeccable. You are greeted at the door with a person who checks you in. The \"onboarding\" process took about 30 mins at least and that was before we were introduced to our floor's butler who walked us through the workings of the room for another 10 mins. I loved that as they were professional, measured, organized. The Butler comes to provide the overview and to facilitate most any wish. Their desk is near the elevator and some will get up & push the elevator for you. People do come in and out of your room, but it is for following up on things, dropping things off - such as the divine mint lemon juice that was fantastic in slanted bottom glasses. Rooms are at least 1600 square feet. Try the Panoramic view rooms - Un-freaking-believable views! The infinity pool area was great. Massages are giving by same sex therapists. Gym has machines that track what you do, reps, effort, etc. Hermes soaps, deodorants, and lotions await. Cuticle creams (what is that really), treats, etc are delivered to your room w/o request. This is one splurge that should be tried. I went through American Express to get some extras such as the massages (free). You can ride in one of the Phantom Rolls Royces, or Mercedes S class cars for a fee. Detail - awesome, Service - Impeccable. As the saying goes, there's not a bad seat (room) in the house!"

My sons Girlfriend insisted we went so she could cross it off her list.We booked for the Skybar for Drinks and snacks at 7.30. YES you have to book and secure your booking with a credit card. Minimum spend PER PERSON is Dhrams 350 or about \u00a370 so it's not cheap just for a drink. (BTW if you don' show they charge you 150 each on the card).You cannot get on to the island to see the hotel unless you are staying or have a booking of some kind so this is one way of seeing the interior of the hotel which is amazing. View from the bar (27th Floor) is OK, it was dark when we were there and I am told best time to go, due to the light, is 6 to 7.30 pm. If you want a better view, and you can see the Burg, try the JW Marquis Hotel (Tallest in the world) their Vault Bar occupies the 71&72 floor of the hotel, really nice).Range of drinks was good, service swift and attentive, bar snack menu limited but good quality. We had burgers (2 \"sliders\" at \u00a336 per person so it not difficult to hit the minimum spend) and battered prawns!.Not sure I would rush back but worth the trip once."

It is impressive for sure, even if not specifically to my taste. Stop on the bridge on the way over to get the obligatory selfie, and take the time to wander around the areas you can see, and pause in amazement at the shops and what they have on offer.

We were slightly disappointed that our trip didn't allow enough time for us to look around. It would have been fantastic to go to the 27th floor to see the views.If you do book an afternoon tea, make sure you book the 27th floor one so you get to see out. We were on the first floor, so we didn't get to appreciate the view.Very nice all in all. Worth a visit to look at the spectacular hotel and the pure luxury the other half live in."

Afternoon tea was 7 courses and had every kind of cake and sandwich you could imagine. Service was superb and they gave us a gift when we left.

I was okay to just see it from the outside but hubby argued the point that this was our first time in Dubai and its the only 7 star hotel and he REALLY wanted to do it. Since spending around $2000 per night for a room was a tad outside the budget, LOL, we made dinner reservations at their asian buffet restaurant. I think the bill was somewhere around $600 for 2 adults, 2 children, and no alcohol. HOWEVER, it was worth it to be able to go inside and see it up close!It sounds crazy but it is unlike anything I've every seen. It is unique and beautiful.

We arrived in the hotel with a little time to spare, we were allowed to walk around the foyer and outdoor areas. At our given time we gave our name to the lady at the desk nearest to the skyview elevator. We waited a short time for an available elevator and were taken up in a small group. We were seated quickly and in our opinion had the best seats in the house, overlooking the Jumeirah beach hotel and Burj Khalifa in the distance. Staff took into consideration dietary requirements and were very polite and attentive. Food was delicious and presented beautifully. Would recommend to those looking for something different to do on their holiday and obviously being treated in a little lap of luxury for the afternoon."

We stayed at Burj Al Arab beginning of July with our 3 year old son, I was a little sceptical about whether this hotel would be for us as we are not rich and famous just an ordinary family who enjoy nice things in life. We have stayed in Dubai for over 10 years and never got round to visiting... All my concerns went out out the window from the second the rolls Royce picked us up from the airport! The driver was extremely friendly and made the whole experience of the transfer to the hotel an experience we will never forget. The Burj Arab itself was breathtaking and very welcoming our suite was stunning and although I was expecting the decor to be a little over the top it worked perfectly!! Out son was treated like a prince having his own robe,Slippers,sweet train,presents the list goes on! We stayed on the 12th floor and out butlers were Paul and Gwen and what fantastic people they were, nothing was to much trouble but genuine with it! The grounds, pool and beach were perfect as was everything else. I really cannot speak highly enough of this beautiful landmark and as out little boy repeatedly says \"the Burj Al Arab\" was the best and our favourite and we will definatly be returning next time, thank you for a wonderful stay!"

It is not possible to visit this place if you don\u00b4t have booking to stay at the hotel or to the restaurants. My husband and I were in honey moon and booked some months in advance to have dinner in the \"culinary flight experience\" (review in that section) and we were able to visit all the restaurants and the amazing hotel. It is a small hotel, sometimes it feels very crowded at lobby. It is amazing to be inside and to look above and see all the colors and the decoration. If you go to Dubai you must visit this place."

I didn't get to see the rooms so they may be amazing, but the lobby and the SkyView lounge is old styled and tacky and nothing amazing. The outside is a cool idea and the closeness to the Palm is great, but otherwise, not worth us going to get drinks and paying the $100USD minimum (PER PERSON!)"

We booked a table at the Junsui Restaurant and were bowled over from start to finish by the excellent decor, the wonderful attentive staff and then the food!Even our daughter who is 2.5 gasped and said 'wow!' and exclaimed how beautiful each part of the building was.Our meal was delightful, the staff going above and beyond to accommodate my vegetarian diet and making sure our daughter had everything she needed.They even surprised my husband with a cake and candles and a soft toy turtle for our daughter! We felt like royalty for a couple of hours and it was worth every hard earned penny! Marvellous!We will definitely come back to stay in the future!"

It was also the tallest hotel in the World, a record that lost a couple of years ago and its an outstanding building to admire. The design of the hotel and how its maintain its a magnet for your eyes, and its a difficult building not to admire, even though if you saw it a thousand time. In the past, was easier to access it. Now a days, to enter, you need either to book one of the 7000 USD suites, make a reservation in one of its very expensive restaurants (way in advance) or book one of the 2 more affordable choices (book for drinks or high tea in the Skyview Bar or Shan Eddar). You can book online the high tea and drinks on line in a very easy way but you would need to print the reservation to gain access to the island. The interior its marvellous and pure luxury, and the staff its so well train to maintain that royal service essence. The food might not be the best of your life in the high tea but the experience might be.The prices varied from 350 DHS to 600 DHS per person (around 100 USD to 180 USD per person). TIP: you can make an online reservation for drinks at the SkyView Bar (which requires a minimum spend of 300 DHS) and pay just what you drink without complying with the minimums."

We went to the Burj for afternoon tea in the sky view bar, this hotel is absolutely stunning we had to book the afternoon tea as you can't just turn up when we arrived we were met by a hotel concierge who directed us to the special lift to the sky bar you have to dress accordingly but they make you feel like a millionaire on arrival we had champagne as soon as we sat down then they asked if we had any dietary preference and which blend of tea you would like the food was fabulous and the views are out of this world , you are allowed upto 2hours for tea and when it was over they gave us both a gift which we did not expect. If you can afford this trip we would highly recommend it as a special day you will never forget"

Although it is expensive, you can dine at some of the restaurants for around $200 a person. What can be said, the decor is opulent. Some of the staff can be a little snobby, but over all, the vast majority are friendly and helpful.The highlight of my previous visit was running into the Egyptian president. Nice he enjoys the Burj while his country burns lol."

The hotel is lovely but tacky if that makes sense. It's just a bit ostentatious. Unfortunately, it was quite smoggy so it was hard to have a clear view of the Palm or World islands. The service was great, but to be honest so are all of the other hotels. We had it on our list of things to do but I wouldn't be rushing back for the price of it. Anyways, with the amount of skyscrapers in Dubai, I'm sure you can get similar views!! Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we went but it was a once off visit."

The champagne was fine, the shortcake with fruit was the best thing we had!! The sandwiches were made on turned up at the edge bread tasted of NOTHING. The steak was tasteless. The scones were edible. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was fine.The cakes ...... well...... they were heavy, unimaginative and mass produced and tasted disgusting. There was nothing dainty about this afternoon tea. It was evident as most people thought this as there were plenty food being returned on the stands!! Our waiter Wen was great though he was very chatty, we had a sea view by the window which was a bonus.Considering the price it's disgraceful the quality of this food we have had far better in the UK for quarter of the price we paid here. Burj Al Arab claim to be the worlds only 7 star hotel ... they could learn a thing or two from afternoon tea at Gleneagles or even any tearoom in UK. We did receive a pen and chocolates this year, pity they hadn't served the chocolates in the afternoon they were delicious, but mass produced too I'm sure!! DEFINITELY WONT BE GOING BACK .......EVER"

Took advantage of the summer rates for UAE residents to go and stay at night with the family (3 young kids below 9) at the Burj. The hotel is really very impressive - much more so in it and up close than it seems from afar for some reason. The suites are very impressive, sure a little gold and maybe dated now, but genuinely luxurious and still very nice to spend some time in. The view over the ocean back to the Palm (in our case) from the master bed with full length windows the whole wall was very good to wake up to. The kids loved the two days at wild wadi and the buggies as expected and we had dinner at the European restaurant at the top which was very good. Food very good (excellent not sure), wine list took a few deep breaths on but the view even at night back over the coast was great to do just once. All in all a very good stay and the kids loved it, as did we. Got to do it at least once if you live here !"

We choose this spot because you can't get in to the Burj Al Arab if you aren't staying there or have restaurant reservations. We definitely wanted to see the inside of this building (and it is amazing) so this was the best restaurant choice that is family friendly ... we were traveling with a minor and there is a 21 age minimum for the Skybar (which would have been our first choice). It was an International buffet, and for three people the bill was over $470 (we had one bottle of wine) but it was worth it for the experience. The food selection was the expected array of seafoods, great salads, roasted meats, pasta, fantastic desserts. We celebrated our anniversary and they very nicely surprised us with a special dessert. One of the managers also took us on a little tour the hotel, so we felt like we got what we were hoping for, a good meal and a nice experience."

At first we had two of the 'special' cocktails which were around 90 AED each, despite being expensive they were so refreshing! We then decided to share a bottle of wine. The service was brilliant, although you had to wait until a window seat was available before you could benefit the view. It wasn't as glamorous as we had thought, however being able to take some amazing pictures of the Burj Al Arab and the views from the top floor was definitely worth it. All holiday we tried to get these photos and found that you couldn't get a decent picture of the building without booking a reservation there."

            "review": "Dissapointing. We saved really hard to afford to go to The Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea, we organised a trip with Virgin back in the UK. We were advised to book early as it gets booked up. We decided my daughter and myself to do the 5 hour trip with a tour guide up the Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea, on to the Burj Kalifa and see the sites, then to come down from the Burj Kalifa and see the water fountains at the Dubai Mall.We arrived at the Burj Al Arab to be directed by our tour guide to the 1st floor. I thought we were waiting to go up in the lift to the Skybar that I had read up so much about.But to my surprise we were directed to the seating area on the first floor were we had low coffee tables and had to be seated with other people from the tour.Ive got to say the whole experience was such a disappointment, the guide even asked if we could take photos upstairs at the view and they said no. I felt the people were very pleasant at the Burj Al Arab but always felt we were an inconvenience.This trip cost \u00a3190.00 per person, I am still so upset to this day that we didn't go to the sky bar.On getting back to the hotel I mentioned it to the Virgin rep and still we have had no email from anybody explaining this. On returning home I read the info on the tour to see that I had misunderstood the info, and yes we were to go to the 1st floor for tea not the Skybar.So please anybody paying this amount of money read the info and make sure you go to the Skybar.Otherwise if you don't go to the skybar dont bother , go to Claridges in London instead."

The lobby impressed us right off the bat with enormous gold pillars and dancing fountains. The honeycomb-style grid is very rare in hotels, and here it was an amazing design element. This hotel is all about breathtaking grandeur.The Royal Suite was actually booked during our visit, despite it being the lowest point of low season. Instead, we went to see one of their #2 suites. It starts with a grand foyer and merges into multiple sitting rooms with many bars, adjoined to offices complete with Mac desktops. The suite has two en-suite bedrooms. I remarked that I really liked the shadow clock that was projected onto the wall. Turns out these clocks were such popular items that the Burj began selling them to their guests!"

            "review": "Best Part was the dancing fountains. My wife and I visited the Burj Al Arab for high tea. A couple of observations below:Burj Al Arab:The hotel is certainly different and commands respect. There is no doubt about that. The structure is amazing from the outside and is quite opulent on the inside. Not necessarily my taste in color scheme but amazing none the less. The dancing fountains on the inside were also quite a hit.High Tea:The food and tea were great however I do have a couple of quibbles. 1. I had booked my reservation and specifically requested a window table as it was my honeymoon. I was placed on a bench overlooking the water away from the window. There is no point in going to this establishment, spending $150 per head on tea and accoutrement, and not getting a window table. It almost ruined my whole experience there as no one from the hotel told me that it was a first come first served policy for the window. Had I known, I would have shown up earlier and not taken so many photos in the lobby. 2. The tea and assorted courses were ok, nothing spectacular. You are up there for the view so do yourself a favor show up early for your seating and be prepared to gently place down your Amex Black Card.Overall:Visiting the Burj Al Arab is a one and done event for me. I would try one of the other establishments for high team next time I visit dubai, or even better yet just eat a regular lunch and continue on to a notable restaurant for dinner."

We booked the 4pm sitting and also booked for cocktails. As advised, we arrived early to look around the lobby and were pleased to find that you were seated in the order in which you'd checked in so we had a great window table overlooking the coast + the sea. The complimentary champagne went down very nicely (so much so that we ordered another glass!). The afternoon tea consists of 6 courses: berry tart, carvery (we had beef + mash), sandwiches, sorbet, scones+ cakes, with unlimited tea/coffee. You are offered additional sandwiches too. The scones and cakes are served on the same stand, in the shape of Burj al Arab. To finish, you are given a box of 4 chocolates. We thoroughly enjoyed everything! The cakes looked a little unappetising when they arrived but tasted wonderful and it's all enjoyed in an incredible setting. Cocktails are not such good value (\u00a325-\u00a330 for one) but we enjoyed seeing the view at day and night. Totally over the top, but thats what you go for! We have do many wonderful photos and memories from one afternoon/evening."

We had the chance to take marvelous pictures of the building (and us standing it front of it!), admire the Disney like structure (inside), the aquarium and the water fountain. We waited in the lobby and had a drink in the caf\u00e9 there (my orange juice was UAE 45). Then we went up with the elevator to the 27th floor and were struck by a beautiful site and the most extensive cocktails menu I\u2019ve ever seen - so much choice, but lucky the waiters are very knowledgeable and can recommend you a drink (I liked both the ones they recommended to me!). The only downside was that it was foggy (sandstorm) and it grew dark within half an hour and as such you didn\u2019t fully appreciate the truly unique place as all you could see was darkness (we were with 3 people so we couldn\u2019t get a seat with the city view, we had an ocean view). The waiter, Ruben, was awesome and because it was a colleague\u2019s birthday he brought her a rose and cake, and ended up giving all of us a rose (which was very sweet). My I two cocktails and they were both great, we were also foreseen of a variety of snacks (mini quiches, olives, roasted almonds and cashews).

The Nepalese manager was very accommodating and asked on our progress at each stage of the lunch.The food was amazing, my family were really happy with each course. So much so that they started taking pictures on their phones. The glass lift going up and then down to the entrance was an experience in itself. Be prepared for the ear-popping feeling. "

They gave a very warm welcome, they found it difficult to actually make a decent cup of tea, despite the many selections on offer, a simple strong english tea was amazingly weak. not a great experience at all, and certainly not value for money, although it had a great view. When it came to leaving the staff at the door were unhelpful, and it took me some time and lots of moans before they got me a cab. The up side was that I did complain, and I would give the hotel credit as they gave me a full refund. So their after sales is great..."

I mean 24 carat gold pillars arounds!We wanted to get the sky view bar but it was fully booked a week in advance as well, any way we got the Sahn Eddar booked. The high tea menu is the same for both sky view and Sahn however in our case you don't get access to the entire hotel only the common area which is also approachable to tourists for free.Our high tea was a 7 course meal with mostly sweets. The food/snacks were indeed fresh and served exclusively. You actually do are treated well but of course for 500dh per head is more about the experience than the food.It was our anniversary so in the end we were presented with a rose and a slice of cake and lastly every table gets a chocolate box with a burj al Arab pen, which kinda leaves you happy taking back a good memory in hand."

I really wanted to see the place for myself and must admit it does not disappoint, from the original architecture to the opulent interior and over the top decoration.Be aware the hotel is on an island and you cannot access this without a prior agreement or reservation. To get in call ahead and preferably make a reservation for lunch or dinner if you want to guarantee access.On a budget - go for the Bab Al Yam pool-side caf\u00e9/restaurant located on the ground floor, you still get to travel through the main parts of the hotel and see the amazing interior. It's an 'all you can eat' buffet but by that I mean expect to pay a minimum of \u00a3100 per head with a drink, take it easy, stay a long time and make the most of keep going up for different food, I had seafood (lobster, crab, prawns and sushi) followed by a pasta dish, then choose your meats with roast potatoes and veg, then make another visit for any bits you still fancy, don't forget to leave room for a couple of desserts. Seriously I did seven light courses over two hours to make sure I was getting the most for my money. The food was great, the best buffet I have experienced.The staff were exceptional, the called me by my first name from the moment I entered and every member of the team knew my name not just one. With the heat they kept bringing me cold flannels.Of course if money is not object then you dine at Al Mahara where you are surrounded by the aquarium and given the 7 star silver service treatment, however expect to pay \u00a3250 per head minimum, significantly more if you go full out with champagne and caviar.In my reservation I also requested access to Sky View Bar located on the 27th Floor because I wanted to check out the views of Dubai. Worth heading up there to see 'how the rich live' and check out the typical Burj Al Arab design, but be warned it is very extravagant and expect to see some of the most expensive cocktails in the world on the menu, one at \u00a3870 allowed you to keep the Swarovski glass and another at \u00a33,000 was made with gold leaf.... A regular wine or G&T would set you back around \u00a320 a piece. I would also suggest heading up there during the day because after dark you cannot actually appreciate the view.Tacky to the extreme the hotel and bar are a world away from what I enjoy in my regular life but I would recommend anyone to check it out just to experience the sheer extreme of a places designed specifically for wealthy Arabs and Russians. The weird side to it was the fifty or so Chinese all lined up for photos in the reception, obviously as part of their sightseeing trip and the two English families sitting close to me at dinner, instead of being aligned with the other foreign wealth at the hotel, they actually spoke and looked like they were on a cheap holiday break, one couple were very 'my husband is considerably richer than yow' and the other family looked and spoke like they had paid for the trip from money earned from appearing on benefits street.On passing the row on Bentleys and Lamborghinis outside I did look back and think 'great to experience, but I prefer to be a sightseer than a resident.'"

They were also the most expensive cocktails I have ever paid for. Saying that I would go again but only for convenience if I was staying at the hotel. which I hope to do one day.

However, much to our surprise, we had a chance meeting with a young local man who had an uncle who has a business in the \"foyer\" so he was able to invite us in. We had coffee and hot chocolate in the \"foyer\" and walked around looking at how the other half lives! Truly an amazing once in a lifetime experience. If you can arrange to take afternoon tea there, then my advice would be to splash out and do it!"

The butler service is amazing. They will carry your beach bag and escort you to the pool. The spa is beautiful and the jacuzzi has much stronger jets than the one in the suite. The beach lounge chair area is exclusive but the swimming area is for all of Jumeriah beach hotel guests including club members and day pass guests so it can be crowded at the weekend. The only thing I didn't like was the video and picture taking in the lobby. There are signs saying this is not allowed but it is not enforced. So you may end up in the background of strangers photos. A nice touch in the breakfast buffet is you select your bread choices and the waiter will take it inside the kitchen to toast and bring it to your table."

A lady was playing on the harp. There were several different courses and they ask if you have any food allergies an any special occasions. It was my wife's 50th and they brought in a Birthday Cake slice with Happy Birthday and a candle. Plus the waitresses sang happy Birthday and the lady on the harp played Happy Birthday. We arrived by taxi and left by taxi which was not included in our booking. It was a bit pricey, approx. \u00a3100 per person when you compare London's Ritz, Savoy, Claridges of approx. \u00a360 but it is a superb hotel and landmark in Dubai and we were on holiday so all is good.

Service in the bar is impeccable, but be warned, it is very expensive. We knew going in that we were expected to spend a minimum of $100 per person, so we went fully warned. We also dined at the Al Mahara restaurant on the first floor, the one that looks like you are underwater. Food and service are excellent, but again, very expensive.Don't expect to be able to stroll in to the hotel just to look around. You will need a reservation and confirmation number with you, or you won't even get into the parking lot - security is very tight. Plan ahead, book your reservations and enjoy the beautiful property as a once in a lifetime experience."

We waited and waitedand they just took their time, not sure why I am sure they have afternoon clients before. The place was not even full then 5 minutes before our departure time, they rolled out trays of pastries and scones but we could only have time for a couple.

Then the cheapest way to get inside the hotel is by having high tea or lunch/dinner.We were a group of 5 that went to the Hightea in the Skyview bar. At first the 620AED or 168USD price tag for high tea seems exorbitant, but the experience is well worth it. You are allowed into the hotel up to half an hour before your scheduled reservation. Take the hour early entry and take loads of photos of the entry way and foyer of the Burj Al Arab :) You will take the separate elevator to the 27th floor, to the Sky view bar for high tea, on a clear day the view is stunning. On the right side is the city (Burj Khalifa) and the left side is the Atlantis hotel and the Jumeirah Palm island.After a glass of champagne you will take part in the many courses (7 I think) starting with a pastry treat followed by slice of beef, a range of sandwhiches, sorbet to cleanse the pallet followed by a tower of cakes, sweets and scones. Apparently a year or two ago, the high tea used to have all the food served at once, but now the experience is broken up into 7 courses.If anything the views were stunning, there was ample of food, and 7 star service as is expected from the Burj Al Arab. Our hightea session had finished 1:00 - 3:30pm, The next session was 4pm, but we were politely asked if we would like to continue our high tea at a different table.An excellent experience albeit, once in a life time."

It was a mixture of theatre and wonderful service which made the dining unique. Had sea bass baked in a salt crust, which the staff then remove the crust at your table and then serve the fish. Went to the sky bar after the meal for drinks, had a memorable cocktail, views are great, but wish we could have experienced it in daylight. Probably one of the most expensive meals we will ever have, but for a special occasion worth it and it will always be one of the most memorable. Thank you so much for our beautiful anniversary cake which was fantastic and brought a tear to our eyes"

Every course was amazing and everyone in the party thought it was great. First we started out with the berry tarts. The berries were SO GOOD! Next came the sandwiches, great and simple. Then came the beef with aj jus, tasty and cooked greatly. Then came the scones, the best scones I have ever had. Then we had the sorbet, amazing. Lastly, they came out with pastries, the best! At the end of us eating they gave out chocolates and a golden pen a really nice touch. The bathrooms are stocked with hermes products so that is a plus!After our amazing afternoon tea, we went to the lobby and got a buggy. The buggy drove us to there private beach and we changed into our t shirts and our swim suits. My kids and I had a lot of fun at the beach and the lifeguards there were really nice and fun to talk to. After an hour of playing we got the buggy and then they got a uber to take us back to our hotel.Is this hotel worth the 560 price tag for afternoon tea? YES IT IS! It was one of the best experiences that my family and friends and I had in Dubai. I loved it!"

I was a little hesitant as everyone raves about the daytime view and advises that it's pitch dark at night. I had no other choice so just went ahead with the evening reservations. We got there were seated nowhere close to the windows so in my head I was already regretting that I didn't listen to the reviews.....BUT everything changed 15mins later when we were offered a table next to the window as one had just became available. Let me tell you..... the view in the evening is just as stunning!! It's pricey but well worth the experience.

Shame they forgot to tell most of the visitors, a right scruffy bunch. We duly went to the sky bar, again visitors very scruffy, the food was either stone cold, over cooked, or had been sitting under hot lights for far to long. Our waiter noticed we were not eating the food prepared and the manageress came over. She very kindly refunded our bill for the food, but we do not expect this standard in a 7 star hotel, the food was of a 2 star rating. Very dissappointed we were going back to stay their for a week. Not now. Also you have a new hotel being built next door, building work going on 24 hrs. So not condusive to a quiet location. Such a shame,"

It was designed by a Chinese interior designer.The design of the restaurant is very ordinary. At night, there is no view to the empty sea in the dark.The food was excellent, and so was the service."

The service was fantastic, as expected, we started with a glass of champagne which was included in the price. You then had the choice of one additional alcoholic drink which included a choice of cocktails. The food was served in typical high tea style, a selection of sandwiches, scones and other sweet things served with a good selection of teas or coffee. It was very enjoyable but not cheap at approx \u00a375 per person! We went for drinks in the sky view bar afterwards, I did not enjoy the cocktail I chose but we did have a nice view to make up for it. I have stayed in many top hotels in Dubai and personally the Burj did not overly impress me. I do not care for the decor, I find it brash and almost cheap looking, the skyview bar in particular with it's blue leather furniture resembles the interior of a 1990,s bingo hall!!! Can't see what all the fuss is about?"

Start you off with a dry champagne that was not very good (upgrade to Dom is another expense). The food was very pretty good. The hot carvery selection was potatoes and beef which was yummy but no seconds on that. You can get seconds on the finger sandwiches, we only liked the chicken, tuna and veggie, the salmon and beef ones were not very good. The scones and pastries were very good and you can get seconds as well. Service was spotty and waiter disappeared for long periods of time which is disappointing at this price point. You can try as many types of their teas, coffees, smoothies, etc as you want, however I was unable to drink my way to the $400 mark (in my mind anyway). The building is over the top but beautiful. Need to book weeks in advance to get the seating you want. They give you a little box of chocolates (spicy flavors) and a pen as a memento."

My husband took me to The Burj Al Arab for lunch on my birthday, the day we got off a cruise ship!I have to say I was expecting not to be too impressed but upon walking through the door my first word was WOW!! The foyer is spectacular and flowers are unbelievable.....everywhere.We had the Culinary Flight lunch which gave us a different course (4) in a different restaurant.We began in Aquarium , then the Asian restaurant, then the restaurant on the top floor for our main course. We ended with desserts and coffee in the lounge on the first floor, overlooking Jumeirah Beach hotel. Here they presented me with a bunch of lovely roses and a birthday cake...which they put in a box for us to take away with us as we were too full to eat it at that point!In every restaurant we had a window table from which we got full advantage of the views and they were happy for me to take photos and even offered to take pictures of my husband and I.Every course was beautifully presented, beautifully served and tasted excellent. I have read reviews of not excellent food but we thought everything was up to standard.The staff were amazing, attentive without being ever present..There was nothing we disliked and the memory of our visit will stay with me always.Thank you to you all for a memorable birthday."

This morning I received a response from Manisha Khan a sales agent at the Burj giving me prices to make a reservation. His e mail said he had also tried to contact me on my telephone number that I had provided and he could not get me. I have kept my phone with me at all times awaiting a call and I have not had any calls or missed calls. This issue I have has just gone pear shaped and would further reduce my star rating given for service. The managers who asked me to contact them provided no contact details hence me using the Burj General e mail latterly. Service is truly appalling. Hopefully the managers will pick up this review on Trip Advisor and contact me . All of my contact details are on the e mail that the hotel has that Manisha Khan responded to.

Booked drinks in the bar, as this was the cheapest way to get in. You need to make a reservation (which they call an invitation). The lobby has a giant aquarium which is cool, but very gaudy. You take the lift upstairs to arrive in what I can only describe as a 70s style out of space themed bar! I assume they are trying to be modern! The cocktail list is amazing, but of course pricey, and there is a minimum spend. The views would be good if it was a clear night (unfortunately not clear for us). Staff were attentive but I was most disappointed when I went into the restaurant (attached to the bar) to look at the view and was told I was only allowed in there with a reservation. Not sure this is worth the price, but it is a story"

I have visited the Burj Al Arab Hotel a number of times both when I lived in Dubai and during my visits in Dubai since.It is a masterpiece of architecture on a reclaimed island that features the hotel; it is one of Dubai's landmark!

In order to be allowed in you have to have a reservation and a 'laissez passer' email confirming it otherwise you cannot enter through the security doors located on the mainland....I had the opportunity over the years to visit the 27th floor restaurant Al Muntaha and its Skyview bar, the meeting and reception rooms on the same floor all with the exceptional views of Dubai, the Al Mahara with its aquarium restaurant, the Al Iwan on the first floor, for afternoon tea at the lobby also on the first floor...."

The other restaurants are over priced and pretentious with the exception of Junsui which if you like Asian food is really good value at cEuro 100 per person - for an all you can eat feast. So go on.

The building just towers over a city which has many skyscrapers by a huge margin. The building is 160 floors high. I reached in the evening and had to buy the express ticket at 300 Dirham for a trip to the roof. If you reach early or maybe there is an online option to buy tickets at 120 Dirham. The journey is divided into 2 legs in high speed lifts. Although they call it the trip to the roof the journey takes you only to 148 floor. Great view, a 360 degree view from a stationery airplane. The night view of Dubai was great. On the way down there is a stop at 124 floor where you can see the buildings and city through binoculars. Enjoyed the trip captured a bit of moment in some photos."

Reservation was good and efficient. Made my booking and was given my reservation reference.Arrived at the hotel and found our way to the restaurant. We were greeted warmly by the reception and was escorted to our table. After we were seated, a gentleman came and introduce himself to be the waiter looking after us. He quickly explain the buffet spread and took our drinks order. Came back many time to check on us during dinner to see if we were ok and even help us take several family photos as we are in 4.We were having a great evening and was happily taking photos around the restaurant when out of the blues, the cook from the grill came over and very rudely told us that we cannot take photos in the restaurant and of the food display. I was shock and embrassed. Never expected to be treated this way and also I did not see any sign written no photo.Very disappointed because we were having such a good time and it was ruin by this rude cook. The restaurant was almost empty. There was at most 10 guest in total. Moreover we were very discreet and we did not distrube Others so we do not understand this rude and poor treatment.Very very disappointing !!!!"

Booked a lunch at Burj Al Arab restaurant called Al Muntaha located at 27 floor otherwise you can't get there First I was tried to book an afternoon tea option but it was overbook for several days in advance so I booked launch at 27 floor restaurant anyway it was 4 course meal awfully overpriced along with wine list that is roughly 2-3 time more expensive compare to the same items you would see in very good American restaurant. For example the least expensive half bottle red wine would cost you 750 dirhams so 750/3.2 = $230 US for quite average wine. As for food and service here what I would say. I am from New York I have been in Jean George I had a dinner at Daniel and many other high end places so the Al Muntaha is not up to the level of New York. The only it up to and even over the New York great restaurants level is in term of prices. Food was OK but nothing special to my taste, service was ...average to the most, waiters are not up to the level of the restaurant for sure no communications no right timing I saw better waiters in some US Dinners I am not joking. So if you absolutely need to have a dinner in Burj Al Arab you have to prepare to pay around a grand for two for meal at least to my taste that is nothing special."

The Burj Al Arab claims to be the only seven-star hotel in the world, even though the ratings system only goes up to five. Overall, awkward vibe to the place. Prices (food, drinks, rooms) are ridiculous, and you constantly have to travel to enjoy the beach or the Madinat. The ultra bling design is dated and hurts the eyes. As you enter, the Your Guest Services liaison tells you that every gold-colored surface you see during your stay is actual twenty-four-karat gold. Even those four-story columns? Even so, she says. Even the thick fourth-story arcs the size of buses that span the columns? All gold. What surprised us most is it seemed a major issue to get a table at the Sky Bar, only to find it empty. Then, asking for food, being told \"the kitchen just closed\". \"Can you not bring room service?\". No. I'm sorry, so a 7-star hotel cannot serve you food at 11:45 pm, while they should arrange for it to be served anywhere we would want, even at 4am. After lengthy talks, we ended up downstairs in the huge empty lobby (why they could not bring the dinner upstairs is a mystery) eating very subpar, very expensive food. In the end, the hotel seemed totally \"empty\" while in high season, lacks a soul, and you just don't feel comfortable there. Dar Al Masyaf or any other Jumeirah resort is a much better, and affordable, choice."

Although a little expensive, around \u00a3250 per person, we were so glad we did. Since our reservation wasn't until 1:30, we spent some of the morning at the Madinat Souk. From here, you can take a complimentary boat to the Al Qasr hotel, then from there take a complimentary buggy to the entrance of the Burj Al Arab. The Al Qasr hotel area is usually restricted to hotel guests but with your reservation, access is granted, offering some great photo opportunities.The Skyview bar is located on the 27th floor, with access via a clear glass elevator. You can take the optional closed elevator if you choose. You will need to make a reservation, several weeks in advance to avoid disappointment, also to ensure you get past security, as no access permitted into the hotel without this.When we were seated, after a short wait at the reception, we had a perfect position, window location on the side (not the front - trust me, side is best) of the restaurant, the view is amazing. Please note, there is a dress code, so bring the right clothes.The Afternoon Tea includes several courses, beginning with champagne, followed by a fruit tart. Beef with horse radish, then onto a variety of sandwiches, which can be topped up if you have a favorite. Cakes and scones with freshly made jams and clotted cream, sorbet and a small box of chocolates completes the food. Coffee and tea (both hot and cold) are available throughout, but be wary of having further glasses of champagne or other spirits, since this will cost extra. Point to note, the experience lasted almost 3 hours.The reservation also allows access to the property, so take the opportunity to take a look around and take some photos. You are free to walk around the lobby, entrance area and various shops, without any time limit. Enjoy the time."

Visiting the worlds only 7* hotel is never going to be cheap and, when booking cocktails at the Skybar, you have to commit to a minimum spend which worked out at about \u00a365 when we visited. This spend is easily achieved as even a standard cocktail costs in excess of \u00a330.However, the experience of visiting this hotel makes it absolutely worth the money. The bar is stunning, as are the views of the Dubai skyline. The cocktails are, as you would expect, first class and snacks are provided (olives, nuts etc).The interior of the hotel is extravagant and a must see and you can also walk around outside the front of the hotel, but inside the security gates, to get a great photo of the hotel up close."

To be honest this was a disappointing afternoon for my wife and I. The thing is there wasn't one thing that stood out that made it bad, it was just very underwhelming for us. A mediocre afternoon in a mediocre hotel and to be honest if you skip it you will not be missing anything. First of all the hotel is supposedly a \"7 star hotel\" but this is a myth, and a self-proclaimed title. You are not allowed to enter the property unless you have a over-priced booking at one of the hotel's restaurants or afternoon tea events. I think the beefed up security is part of the hotel's scheme to add to the allure of this property which to be completely sincere is nothing special at all. Upon entering the lobby you will be underwhelmed with the hotel's appearance, and directed to the special elevator that takes you directly to the skyview bar. As a non-hotel guest you have no access to tour any other part of the hotel except the main lobby and the restaurant or event you are attending. We asked to tour the spa facility just to get an idea of why this hotel is advertising itself as \"7 star\" but we were denied access and I am almost certain that we would have been underwhelmed there as well. The elevator ride to the sky bar is the only nice part because it is a glass elevator that gives you a nice view of the sea. Other than that the Sky View bar is very dated with a green computer chip theme throughout, anyone who has been up there will know exactly what I mean. The day I went it was extremely foggy with poor visibility due to the sandstorm. So no view and an underwhelming d\u00e9cor and atmosphere in a self-proclaimed 7 star hotel for a whopping 400 USD is not my idea of a fun experience. One glass of champagne is included, and unlimited coffee and tea with small samplings of tea sandwiches and a dessert platter. The food was nothing to write home about, little sandwiches and a small beef dish was not worth the money or more importantly the time and effort to get to this hotel, and how much coffee and tea can one person really drink? It would have been enough for me to have snapped a few pictures of the hotel from the outside and continued on with my day. I made the mistake of paying the exorbitant price thinking I was going to have an amazing experience in the world's first \"7 star hotel\" but I was wrong and I am paying this advice forward. In my humble opinion, save your money, or at least if you are keen on stepping foot into the hotel to experience the \"7 star wonder of it all\", book yourself a dinner reservation in one of the restaurants rather than the afternoon tea, maybe you will get more value for your money."

There are so many choices of meat, including Wagyu, fish including Lobster, Alaskan King Crab Claw and many other fish and shellfish, Vegetarian dishes and salads too numerous to mention and 2 large tables full of desert deliciousness. On top of all this if you just want breakfast fare eggs any way are available and there is a wide selection of cheese to choose from.

But the most unforgettable tour was the Royal suite of Burj Al Arab."

Even with Reservation, they require MIN. 250+ AED Charge per person.. and yes, they will charge it .. as they require your Credit Card Number, at the Security Gate.. in case you just want to \"Look\"..Go to property next door (Jeremiah Beach Hotel - the one that looks like a giant \"sail\") .. Even better, at night .. get great pics and views of Burj Al Arab. No entrance charges!!!!"

They are beautiful, modern, conveniently located and have top notch restaurants and services. The free wifi and beautiful views were a plus! What impressed me most was the staff. No matter where you were in the hotel you were treated like old school royalty. It was the most superior customer service that I have ever experienced. My satisfaction was their #1 priority. I was so impressed! In all future journeys, if there is a Jumeriah hotel in the city I'm visiting I will definitely be staying there!!!"

The only real ways in are to either be a guest, or make a reservation at one of their many bars / restaurants. You can't simply walk in as there is a separate security gate before you're even allowed to cross the bridge to get there.But one of the most economical ways to get in is booking an afternoon tea at one of the restaurants or bars there (economical still means the priciest afternoon tea you'll probably ever experience!). We chose to indulge in the Sky Bar to enjoy the view from near the top of the Burj Al Arab. You can also just have tea at the lobby restaurant - but the experience isn't nearly as exclusive. Reservations are handled via email and there are essentially two sessions (1PM and 4PM start times). You might get a 1:30PM or 4:30PM sitting, but what basically happens is all the prime tables / seats by the windows of the Sky Bar get filled by the early guests. The rest of the seating is away from the windows, so not quite a \"wow\" experience. The food was above average, not mind-blowing. But you could have as much as you wanted (to justify the cost). The desserts were pretty good. But I actually enjoyed sampling the various teas and taking in the view. The one knock on it was the service - it seemed like the staff was overwhelmed at times and we never had a consistent waiter because numerous people brought our food and drinks to us. So it was confusing at times and we had to wait to catch anyone's attention at others. For a self-proclaimed 7-star hotel, I expected a little more - but overall, it was worth doing once."

The hotel id awesome to look and even has a spectacular lightshow at night, but besides that, is a complete locked down location without acces from Outsife. FUN FACT: The hotel - and Casino, is built 50m out in the Gulf as gambling is not allowed on Dubai soil :-)"

The security is extremely tight and you'll only be admitted if you're a guest or have a reservation at one of the restaurants/bars. As the Burj Al Arab is a Dubai icon any visit to the city should include a stop by the hotel. You just need to figure out how to do it. The meals are staggeringly expensive and you're looking at a minimum spend of AED 300 per person if you wish to visit the bar. My suggestion - splurge in a meal. Your best bets are either Al Muntaha on the top floor (best for lunch so you'll get a view) or Al Mahara, the stunning restaurant with an enormous two storey acquiring which the tables surround. If you really want to splurge go for the Culinary Flight which will take you to every bar and restaurant in the hotel (see my review). The food is very good and the service incomparable."

On the second day, I took a cab there and totally forgot that I had packed my banners in there for my meeting that day. I got out of the cab and left the banners. As soon as I hit the lobby, I remembered they were in the cab. I ran out and told the guys at the front and they stopped the cab at security and averted a total disaster for me! If you get to go to one of the top floors, I think I was on the 22nd, you can get a very clear view of the Palm. It's magnificent, so make sure you go there. The service was impeccable and I was assigned a gentleman who took care of my many requests. It's a must see!"

The glass lift took us up to the twenty seventh floor and we were taken to a table overlooking the sea, what a view!

For the price .. not .. unless you stuff yourself with goose liver pate -- yeap you can get a big slap of foie gras -- but I don t like it so that leaves me with a comparism of the Traiteur Buffet on Fridays which I personally think is much much much better (and for nearly the same price all drinks are included i.e. bubbles and grapes) where at the Burj you even pay for the water.

After seeing this iconic building numerous times on TV and in magazines we knew when we booked our first trip to Dubai in Feb 2014 we had to go just to see if it lived up to its reputation and all the hype that came with it. (This review is a little late,my reminder is that we are here again in Feb 2015). The hotel is impressive, ostentatious and indulgent. The decor offers the rich decadents the chance to indulge more in luxury and they certainly do. The atrium and the waterfall when you first walk in makes you start to absorb the luxury of this hotel immediately. You are able to look round the lobby and yes some people were taking photos, despite the rumours that you can't. We then went up to the Sky Bar where we had something to eat and cocktails. This was a lovely experience and one I hope to do again, hopefully afternoon tea next time I visit. Later on in the evening we had lattes and very very very expensive brandy in the Al Muntaha, but this is one of those places where you just have to try it at least once. On the whole we did have a good time. Staff were friendly and service was good, however it is very expensive and be prepared to pass out at some of the prices. But most people who visit this place know it is not bargain bucket hotel, but that doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune and do the whole afternoon tea, cocktails in the bar and dinner in the restaurant in one visit. Do I think it's 7 star? Certain aspects yes, other aspects I'm not so sure about and regardless of star rating I do feel it is way over priced. This said I would still say to anyone who visits Dubai try this place at least once."

The whole experience was amazing, with fabulous food and lovely service and staff. . A special mention goes to the guys who work on the security (especially the young lad who gave us the task to find an American dollar - he will know who he is) hut who arranged for a member of staff to give us a tour in a buggy. Thanks you so much as the buggy driver was friendly, helpful and full over information about the area. I can't remember his name but if you mention Miss Susan he will know who he is. The whole experience was amazing and one which we will never forgot. It's a must to do while visiting Dubai and the hotel interior is stunning."

To go in the hotel you have to have a restaurant reservation and to pay in advance by credit card 400AED per person, or you need to be an hotel guest. First time I booked for a family dinner was Christmas night 2011at Majlis Al Bahar restaurant for a Christmas BBQ B even though I paid 1600AED upfront I discovered that the restaurant Buffet. It was only when the valet parking took the car that an hotel receptionist by the door informed me that Majlis Al Bahar is not in the hotel building, it was on mainland shore and not on the island. What a scam no one mentioned that over the phone, when I was making the reservation. It was even the hotel staff on the phone who suggested this restaurant. We tried to visit the famous bar just to take a look we were not allowed to step in, we were told you need a reservation in the bar, or you need to be an hotel guest. Just a look no no no, even if only two of us will go in take a look from the window? Nope a firm No and no negotiations about it. Very friendly I have to say. So first I was scammed and then almost thrown out, great. It was a Christmas BBQ dinner, the third stab the menu was seafood and nothing but seafood. Two members of my family are allergic to seafood?!! and to make things worse even the salads contained seafood. OK let us compensate on desert, this was the joke of the century, desert was nothing but watermelons. Yup this is it and nothing else. 1/10I wrote a complaint to the Burj Al Arab, Jerome Barbeau who was the Food and Beverage Manager then replied bla bla bla:\u201d The Culinary team will review the existing Majlis Al Bahar Menu and as well as preparation and production of food to ensure our guests receive high quality products as expected of Burj Al Arab.\u201d And nothing else except we wait to see you again. Nothing like we will return your money or we will invite you for something complementary, that was it. I decided never again.In November 2014 a friend of mine called to say he is in Dubai and staying in the Burj Al Arab. He invited me for dinner with a bunch of school friends. This time it was in the hotel it was the Al Iwan restaurant, which is an Arabic Buffet. I was for the second time terribly disappointed from the food and the selection of the buffet. For the amount of money paid you are better going somewhere else. Karam Beirut, Abdelwahab or Burj Al Hamam are 10 times better. The only difference is that in Al Iwan there is some Moroccan food besides the Lebanese food. Who cares if it doesn\u2019t taste good? 4/10I will never ever go and pay a dime in any of Burj Al Arab restaurants, if I\u2019m invited I will just go because someone made the effort and the gesture too, I will try to advise them to make the dinner somewhere else. But for me to go to Burj Al Arab as a paying customer this will never happen again, I refused to be taken for a ride for the second time."

Having seen this iconic building so many times in pictures and on the TV, I was keen to experience it myself - and it was well worth the wait!! The entire experience was extremely luxurious. The hotel itself is fantastic we were able to look around the lobby area for some time with no pressure to move on before heading to the Sky Bar. Everyone we encountered was friendly and welcoming.The high tea itself was excellent. Fantastic service and wonderfully presented food across 6 courses with Champagne. Whilst our very friendly waiter did subtly inform us that more than one glass of champagne would require a charge, he did also, by contrast, say that we should experience as much of the food, tea and juice selection as we could possibly stomach! I wasn't expecting that. We left absolutely full to bursting!The experience was in no way rushed and despite what I had read beforehand everyone was walking around the bar and taking photos at leisure. All very relaxed and a wonderful experience in one of the world's most iconic buildings and best hotels. Worth every penny."

We had to report to the security guard before crossing the bridge to the hotel and on entering we were greeted by three members of staff and directed to the upper floor to our destination. We were greeted by fountains tumbling down and as you looked up, a sea of golden balconies as we were directed to the upper floors where we waited until we were shown into the lift that took us to the Skyview Bar for afternoon tea. The staff were attentive and quick. The food was fabulous and everything was topped up without having to ask. There was a wonderful view of the sunset from where we sat and a couple of hours later we left very sad that we were not staying there longer. I would highly recommend the experience - not to be missed."

Even drinks required a minimum more than 76 USD at other restaurants. Not worth it. The waiter recommended 2 deep fried appetizers. Glad I only got one because I couldn't finish the calamari. Had to remove the batter for half of the calamari because the batter started to stick to my ribs. Don't get me wrong, it was good, crispy calamari, but I couldn't handle too much deep fried food. The second snack I got was dim sum (1 small pork bun, 1 shrimp hargow, and 1 chicken hargow). Ehhh... I rather go to San Francisco Chinatown to eat them. I chose a cocktail which consisted of tea, citrus juices, and some Russian liquor. Not bad, but was watery half way because there was too much ice. There were also complimentary nuts (cashews and almonds) and a variety of olives drenched in olive oil which made it less salty than the usual marinated olives. I was not impressed with the lobby area as It looked like any other 5 star hotel. I expected more for a 7 star hotel. The lobby area was smaller than I expected. Staff was very helpful and friendly. I have no regrets coming here otherwise I would be always be wondering what a 7 star hotel be like."

It is a seven-course affair beginning with the UAE's world-famous stuffed dates and then moving on to a fruit tart, a carved beef filet, scones with clotted cream, pastries, etc. It is $150 USD but well worth it. Consider it dinner as you won't be able to eat again until the next morning. Make sure to book a month in advance of your stay and ask for a table by the window. Be prompt and you'll likely get it. Not to be missed! The view of the marina at sunset is spectacular. Also, while in Dubai, be sure not to miss a nice walk in the Marina District (not the same marina as above). It is a great way to spend a morning stroll."

High tea is definitely the cheapest way inside but the tea itself is hardly the best in town - not even close to the top. The price is ridiculous (500 AED/person without champagne, 550 AED with it) compared to other, much better teas in town. You are paying to get inside the building, that's it. The tea service is a bit fussy and the food isn't all that good, quite stale actually. It seems to be that way every time, and we've been 6-8 times with guests. The tea has several courses so it's really more of a meal - we often go for the 1:30 pm seating and consider tea to be our lunch for the day. You will start with a plated nibble, followed by sandwiches, beef, scones, pies/tarts and then chocolates. I might have even missed a course - it's a lot of food but none of it very tasty.If you are looking for high tea, I would recommend The Palace hotel - great Arabian atmosphere, not fussy service and much better prices. (Also, in years past they have had Entertainer vouchers, haven't checked for 2015.)One cool thing that happened on another visit for tea - we asked to see a room and they escorted us and showed us around. That part was cool. The rooms are just as garish as the hotel though."

It cost \u00a395 each, which is maybe a little steep in price, but I think it's definitely worth it! We went to The Burj for about 3.30 for our afternoon tea starting at 4. We walked into the front entrance and wow it's absolutely stunning! There is a water fountain in the lobby which was all lit up and changed colour it looked fab! So pretty. We headed up the stairs towards the lifts which take you right up to the 27th floor. The hotel decor is out of this world! Absolutely gorgeous. We went up in the lift to the Skyview bar. You can see out the lift over Dubai it was wonderful. We were seated at our table right by the window, in a perfect spot, where you could see for miles around Dubai. It's easily the best view I've ever seen! Mesmerising! You get a free glass of champagne while there which is nice. We were given sandwiches, a mini carvery, cakes/scones and several little dishes which were lovely, the food was tasty and everything was set out so well.We spent most of the afternoon there and moved to the bar in the evening. We watched the sun setting and it turn dark outside. Dubai looks amazing all lit up at night! Especially from that high up. Stunning!The drinks we got from the bar were a little pricey, but it's what you would expect from such an extravagant hotel. I would highly recommend this experience to anyone thinking of going. I loved it from start to finish!"

These days you can book two levels either flors 128 or you can go for the full package and get to the 128th floor and to the 148th. I decided to go the whole way and book the full experience ie the At the Top experience and I have to say I am glad I did.Yes it is not cheap at AED 500 but balance that agains will I ever be back or will I do it again it is one of lifes experinces. Pre book is a must you can book before you go and collect tickets from the machines in the Lower ground floor of the Dubai Mall.Yes you do get the odd queue however if you go the whole way ie the 14th floor you are taken into a small room to the side where you get offered an Arabic coffe and a selection of small arabic food dates etc.Once you are all together you are escorted by a guide through security and inot an elevator they have two speeds one does 120 floors in 60 seconds yes that is a secon a floor the other lift is slightly slower at 1min 30. this takes you to floor 128 and then you are transferred to another lift to take you to the 148th floor. This is something special as the lift arrives you are greeted and offered light refreshements and some canapes. The view from 148 floors up is just amazing. You can even go on an outside terrace and feel the wind truly great experience and one that I will never forget.As I have said if you are prepared to go the distance to Dubai then this is a must see and doo my suggestion is go around sunset or after 1800 as the Fountains can then be seen from above as well as on the ground level and the fountains are woth the view.Okay regarding the Gift shop several people have said it is expensive but once again you need to balance this up I honestly felt that you could get a good range of gifts from fairly cheap to yes Expensive but it does cater for most budgets.Overall I am glad I did it and I hope you will be too if you do it."

The stay was very warm and welcoming as we had people escort us to the lobby and to our suite as we reached the hotel. We had a personal butler to attend to us when we needed. Our room was just amazing, facing the sea and the view was out of this world. We were welcomed with fresh juices and fruits baskets, not to forget the yummy chocolates! The only thing i was disappointed was when i took my son to the kids club, there was this marketing lady who was a bit rude and asked us to come back as they were doing photoshoots at the kids club for the hotels website. She dint even bother to let us know how long would it take and we kept waiting outside till they finished the shoot. Finally another lady working in the kids club came and called us in so that our son could play... that was a downside i felt during our stay there. A bit unprofessional from the marketing staff.Overall, the stay was lovely.. the room was amazing, the food is just delicious and fresh.

Exquisite views, rich d\u00e9cor and exceptional service are just a few of the delights the Burj Al Arab has to offer. Simply sitting in the lobby watching the fountains at the top of the escalators was a treat in and of itself. Everywhere you look, you are enticed by bright colors, gold accents (might I add... Rolex clocks!) and lux textiles. The staff's only wish is to make your experience unforgettable... and that's exactly what they did. I highly recommend the Culinary Flight experience if you are not staying in the hotel. It was a great way to sample the various restaurants while indulging in the romantic atmosphere and amazing views. Al Muntaha restaurant is not to be missed!

If you try this bar be sure to order a 'Mr big' you will not be disappointed. The staff were so friendly and very attentive. They upgraded our table to the best view in the house which boasted stunning views of the dubai skyline and in particular the Burj Khalifa. I have visited the Burj Al Arab twice and both times have been amazing. Would definitely visit again and reccommend to anyone visiting Dubai."

It was a simple and smooth process to get from the boom gate all the way through to the entrance of the Skyview Bar (must be over 21 to have high tea in the Skyview Bar due to the legal drinking age). The views are amazing over the sea and some of the city (not 360 degree views).You are served limitless cups of tea, coffee, hot chocolate etc as you wish and you receive a complimentary glass of champagne on arrival. You are then served a selection of various courses of food as the day goes on (all the food is incredible!). You can also ask for as much finger foods, deserts, sandwiches etc as you wish...we certainly did!A great touch was receiving a box of chocolates per person when you are finished. The service is incredible and you also get as much time as you wish to walk around in the hotel and view the various shops and take pictures before leaving.A small tip would be to request a window seat as the views are lovely! Also note that the dress code is smart. Although it may seem silly to wear long trousers, smart shoes, and a button up shirt when Dubai is a hot place...they pump the air-conditioning so you will be very comfortable, ladies wearing dresses may even want to bring a light top as you may get a bit cold."

Its very opulent , glittery and Arab in taste , not very refined and quite gaudy .You can get a more satisfying look from the outside , where the architectural lines can be admiredThe Jumerah beach hotel has better food and you feel human being there at least."

Seven courses of sumptuous dining. Commenced with sparkling date juice followed by a mixed berry tartlet. Next was a range of finger sandwiches and the chefs charcuterie - mashed potato and fillet steak! A strawberry sorbet followed to cleanse the pallet before tucking into fruit and plain scones, a range of preserves and clotted cream! Finished off with cookies and French pastries. All accompanied with unlimited tea and coffee. Cappucinos were topped with 24 carat gold flakes! The kids received a teddy bear each and we were handed a box of chocolates each on departure. We were entertained by a solo harpist followed by a classical quartet. The whole meal took almost 3 hours! We just did not want to leave.It was a fit and terrific end to our lovely cruise to Dubai, the Emirates and Oman! For here we went to the airport for our flight home with very heavy hearts!"

We caught the lift up, sat in a very nice lounge. A young lady bought some nice cakes on a 2 tiered cake stand and poured out the coffee for the group. So we had Coffee and a couple of cakes and a good look out of the window. After a good quarter of an hour she reappeared and offered more coffee. (but no more cakes) We then waited about another 20 minutes and were escorted out the front door.So you see, I have had High Tea at the Burj Al- Arab. It cost me about 150 Australian dollars. Yes the hotel was very glamorous. I then went back to my hotel and had something to eat. So there you go.Brian, from Perth W. Australia."

As a birthday treat, I booked afternoon tea at the BAA on our last day in Dubai, to both experience the hotel and its ambience and celebrate the occasion in style.You cannot get past the security post without a reservation and this does prevent hordes of tourists descending upon the place to gawk at the lobby and its fountain displays. Whilst general hotel visits have been stopped, it was noticeable that the occasional Chinese tourist bus arrived exactly for this purpose.This iconic building is impressive from the outside and the lobby and first floor are sumptuously decorated, containing fountain features and the inevitable aquarium. The first floor fountain is quite mesmeric and the display contains one or two surprises with water jets being propelled up to 42 metres in height. Everything smacks of quality, extravagance and luxury.Afternoon tea is served in the Skyview bar on the 37th floor which has great views over Palm Jumeirah and the unfinished World Islands. We booked tea for 4.30 pm and this meant we were able to enjoy great views of the sunset over the Palm.The tea was very good and you certainly won't leave feeling hungry due to the richness of the food and the quantity served. Events started with a glass of champagne and were followed by a fruit shortbread course, the chef's course of beef with mashed potatoes and then the finger sandwiches, scones, patisserie and finally a sorbet. There is an extensive menu of teas from around the world and a wide range of coffees. The service is impeccable without being stuffy and a pianist plays some relaxing music at one end of the bar. My wife was presented with a red rose and a small birthday cake with candle which was a nice touch.Of course this doesn't come cheap at AED 620 per person and it is debatable whether this is really good value for money. But the opportunity to experience the Burj Al Arab first hand should not be missed in my humble opinion."

The food quality was sub-par. I had to request a dinner roll/bread for there was none in the selection. You would have taught that for $153.00 per person, not including drinks, they would have included a good selection of fresh breads. Beverages (tea, sodas, etc). start at $20.00 per serving.

If you go from the Dubai Mall, it's a very long walk. The check-in and check-out also takes a lot of time.Plan the duration at the viewing area for a maximum of 20 minutes because it gets boring after that.The photos they take there have very obvious photoshop effects and aren't worth the price they ask for."

There was no signage to this effect, nor was the guard willing to answer questions regarding why we could not go in for a meal or a drink. VERY disappointed. Visiting this iconic location was on the top of my must-see must-do list for Dubai. We checked the website only to find that the link to book a table was not working either. Poor, very poor! Adding insult to injury (poor sore feet), we'd just spent almost an hour walking there, and could have used a cold drink and some hospitality. Suffice to say we found it next door at the Jumeirah.

            "review": "Still the Dubai symbol. Although the Burj Khalifa is newer and of course taller, the Burj remains the Dubai symbol in my opinion. Standing defiantly to the Arabian Gulf this hotel is a mystical symbol of Dubai. Because it's little bit dislocated and by the waterfront, and everything around is vast with no other high buildings, you cannot observe it's height (it doesn't seem that imposing). Just have in mind it's around 320 m tall, only some 15 meters below the Eiffel tower.As a non resident you can access only up to the control point (beside the Wild Wadi aqua park entrance). From there you can see it's back (most frequent photo). Another view (the better one) is from the Wild Wadi if you enter it. Another good view is from the garden bar at Jumeirah beach hotel, where you can enter freely, which is a deluxe 5 star hotel, so it's interesting to enter anyway. Those are the best free options to see the Burj from close.Going on the Jumeirah beach, you'll have a great view of it while sunbathing or swimming, but it is more far, so the pics wont be clear because of the heat haze. To see the front side you need to go the Palm (Atlantis hotel), but this is also far, or to take the Yellow Boats tour which passes in front of it.On the other hand, to enter it is very expensive. The cheapest overnight starts from 3.000 EUR. The \"cheaper\" option is to make a reservation in one of their restaurants. The prices are also very high starting from around 100 EUR pp.You can choose from the afternoon tea to Arab, far East, Mediterranean....cuisine.We visited the Junsui far eastern restaurant, and I think it's better value you get than the most popular Afternoon tea. About this experince in the Junsui review.The Burj inside is even more glorious than from outside. It smells expensive and luxurious. It has the biggest atrium in the world, which even looks smaller due to the big floor heights (one floor equals two normal floors). Everything is shiny, goldy, with high end shops, aquariums, marbles, mosaics,...As a guest you can visit the ground floor, mezzanine and first floor.All in all, this is a once in a lifetime experience, overpriced in every way, but the only way to get inside the only 7 star hotel in the world, the most luxurious one where film and sports stars stay, along with world jet set. The management knows it and counts on that fact, so it's up to you to decide yes or no."

I was also amazed by their hospitality. There is a fountain in the center of the burj which is fascinating too. the way the water flows from fountain gives you an impression of the birds and fish. I visited there in 2010 and I dunno what it is look like now, because Dubai people keep changing everything quite often making them better and better.

The check in if thats what you call it was a pleasure and we were made to feel like royalty from the moment we arrived. The butler service on each floor is a tremendous idea. We were unsure about taking the children who are 6 and 11, however even this was exceptional and the highlight was a knock at the suite door and a mini train arrived with a pick and mix of sweets for the children. The suite itself was the best i have stayed in at any hotel around the world. We can't wait for an excuse to go again."

We started out in their underwater restaurant and had our appetizer there. At the first restaurant they make you choose your meal for the rest of the tour. Then we headed to the Chinese restaurant. (Didn't like that one as much because it was casual and the place smelled like fried food, left the restaurant feeling oily). After that we headed to the sky bar, the elevator ride was nice because we could see the ocean view while going up. Lastly, we ended up at the lobby coffee tea area to end our meal, and we were stuffed. It was nice seeing the restaurants and I guess it was worth the experience if you weren't staying at the Burj."

View up the centre was also really neat. That said, if you have been to other very tall buildings with similar architecture, it may not have the expected wow factor as expected. (This place reminded me of the JinMao Tower in Shanghai but with an Arabic flavor instead of the opulent Asian gold one.)The buffet was alright. Could not compare to Shangri-la or St Regis even though this is supposed to be a 7-star hotel. Selection was adequate, but quality was sub par. The Junsui restaurant features more Asian fare (Japanese, Korean & Chinese), but also included an 'international' western section (ie omelettes, waffles, french toast, bacon...). Pastries were excellent. Everything else was mediocre. There is another restaurant offering breakfast, but that is a set meal - not a buffet. Price is the same so this has the better value.Interestingly enough, ALL of the diners there for breakfast were from mainland China. They had special servers speaking Chinese so they must have a huge clientele from the mainland who actually stay at the hotel. Dress code is supposed to be smart casual, but fashion tastes vary. I think as long as you are not in shorts and flip flops, you would be ok. There were plenty of people wearing sneakers and other assorted outfits. Can't speak for afternoon tea and dinner though.We wanted to mozy on up to check out the rest of hotel, but the security guy said we could not go up because we did not have a reservation there and the restaurants up there were closed. Rest of the hotel was neat to look at, but again, nothing super exciting if you have been to other really nice hotels - especially the ones in Asia.Can't say the breakfast price was worth going in. If you take the Yellow Boat Tour, you get a good photo op of the hotel.I can now say I've been there and done that, but not worth it."

The luxury and the opulence is something to be believed. One needs to stay at the hotel to get the full experience of the quality and service that the hotel provides. We found the staff from the concierges, the waiters, to our personal butler who provided our every needs, to be most polite, friendly and helpful. The restaurants and the food are of a very high standard but are expensive but I'm afraid this is what you have to pay to stay in such a luxurious hotel. The only downside we found to the hotel was that during the day and early evening they let too many non guests look around the lobby area which gives no privacy at all to the hotel residents, which really shouldn't be allowed as the prices are very high to stay here. In saying that, with the luxury of the hotel and the pleasantness of the staff we would probably stay here again as it is no doubt the best hotel in Dubai."

Nice entrance and beautiful lobby. By name you will be guided to your table and seats. Do make early reservations to get you the best seats, viewing the skyline and Burj Khalifa. We had reservations for 16:00 so perfect time to watch sunset. We made our reservations one moth in advance and had window seats facing sea and skyline. Staff is very helpful, polite and friendly. Tea and coffee as much as you want. 5 courses with different food/ sweets and ice-cream with refill in beween. Lovely glass of champagne is included the price. Very recommended and a perfect place for special occasions!"

            "review": "Skybar afternoon tea. We pre-booked afternoon tea at the Burj al Arab Skybar for 4 pm before our recent visit to Dubai. When reserving this we asked for a table facing the Dubai skyline. We were informed we could arrive 30 minutes in advance and as we arrived we had to show our reservation confirmation at the security check point on the land side of the access bridge. Our taxi then dropped us off right outside the hotel entrance. The views of the hotel externally were stunning and internally the atrium, aquarium tanks and fountains were very attractive. We took pictures in the atrium and then made our way to the registration desk at the rear of the hotel, gave our name and were asked to wait until around 3.45 pm. Couples or groups were then individually called in turn to take the lift to the 27th floor where we were met by another member of staff who showed us to a pre selected table at our chosen location. On the way to our table we were warmly greeted by a number of members of staff which felt very welcoming. The views of Dubai, the World and the Jumeirah Palm were stunning both during daylight and after dark. The sunset over the Palm Jumeriah at 5.30 pm was particularly attractive. Our package cost around \u00a3100 each and included in this was a glass of champagne and as much tea and coffee as you wanted. I do not drink alcohol and was given a glass of sparkling date juice, although I was still charged the full price. A wide variety of different teas and coffees were available as well as hot chocolate. The food was beautifully presented and tasted great although it was of modest quantity. It comprised a berry tart, the chef\u2019s carvery, finger sandwiches, scones with jam and cream and cakes followed by sorbet. We were offered extra sandwiches during our tea. The service was very friendly although there was a bit of a delay in us getting our first pot if tea. By 6.30 pm people were starting to pay their bill and depart and we did likewise shortly after. We noticed as we left the restaurant that none of the staff bid us farewell in contrast to the attention we received when we arrived. We left the hotel and walked along the bridge towards the shore admiring the views of the building as we left. At the security gate there was a taxi rank where we were able to get a taxi back to our hotel. We thought our visit to the Burj al Arab Skybar for afternoon tea was very expensive but we enjoyed the experience and were glad we did it. We would recommend it."

It's been awhile since I've stayed at the Burj Al Arab but after reading some of the reviews that said the hotel is just average from people who only had dinner in a restaurant and not even actually stayed in the hotel I though I'd write about my experience. I have stayed at hotels all over the world on every continent except Australia and I have not received better service than at this hotel. I stayed for 5 nights. I was picked up from the airport by a driver looking very charming in a white suit, driving a white BMW. He was very polite and he greeted me with a bouquet of beautiful roses. Once in the car he gave me a small face towel to freshen-up, then a glass of champagne and my choice of soothing music to listen to on the ride to the hotel. Where else would you get this kind of service? Once at the hotel I was greeted with a refreshment then taken directly to my room where I checked in from the comfort of my room from the lovely office in the room. There I was introduced to my personal butler and informed of all the hotel services. The room was amazing! A curved marble staircase that took me to my bedroom and two stories of windows with a great view of the beautiful ocean. My butler was very attentive. He was at my beck and call whenever I needed him. He went above and beyond.The food and service at the Skyview Bar and the Junsui were excellent. The hostess greeted me by name every time I entered any of the restaurants. The service of the entire staff was impeccable! I can't say enough about the Burj Al Arab."

We first started with a golf cart ride from our hotel to the Burj al Arab which can only be reached by a private road that goes over the Persian Gulf (it\u2019s located on an island in the Persian Gulf). Security confirmed we had a reservation before letting us proceed on this road which has only been traveled by a few. When we arrived we checked in at the front and proceed to tour the atrium area which provided splendid views of the hotel. It was magnificent. Rolex Wall clocks. Gold plated doors. Opulence at the highest level. We ended the experience with a ride in the private mercedes the burj al arab has on site. All white. Felt like a million bucks heading back to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. Looking out at the Burj al Arab that night felt a bit different because we had now experienced what it was like to eat at every restaurant in the one of a kind hotel."

The food was wonderful, the service was wonderful, the view was wonderful....so what could possibly go wrong? Well, even though the hotel is only accessible to those that have tickets (either to dine, or have tea, or to stay for the night) what they DON'T tell you is that they sell tickets to busses full of tourists!! Hordes of tourists.So right in the middle of our tea-- an entire bus of tourists came into the hotel and swarmed the whole area where we were having tea on the second floor. It was terrible.I will say the hotel did have a little bit of velvet rope to keep the area separate, they even had a 'do not take photo' sign....but somehow the tourists, who had bought a ticket to 'tour' the open areas in the hotel just flocked the area, taking pictures and videos , oblivious to others that had paid for tea.I'd never return again. I thought it was so tacky of the hotel to open themselves up to 100s of tourists who treat the place like a zoo. This was so tacky and unpalatable to us, never again.Don't do the afternoon tea. You will save yourself $300."

The downer was the service, The service was definetly not 7 star service. They waiters handed me a fork holding it in their bare hands, not even in a napkin or on a plate. If you dont specificly book a table by the window you could end up looking at a pilar or a wall. Everything is 40-50% more expensive but not better than in other hotels. I also had the business lunch there, I left more hungry than when i came there. When I asked some extra bread the waiter started laughing and looked surprized.So unless you realy want to tick the box dont go there, the service is below standard and the Burj is only nice on the outside."

With the money charged we believe lunch & dinner should be made available at a set menu complimentary of the hotel made as a choice to eat or not at the hotel. Staff are very formal which is fine but upon having a guest the hotel believe that there should be a curfew for that guest to leave. Extremely embarrassing if you wish to have a long night. Mind you there are no conditions or agreement between the hotel guests and the hotel in relation to this matter. Once confirmed that the guest may remain in the suite in relation to hotel regulations the hotel manager apologised and brought flowers the next day. Other than that the breakfast is amazing. Great hotel for honeymooners. Highly recommended for the extravagant. The 3 night stay well exceeded $5K. Would we go there again...??? Highly unlikely.

Walking up the dallas stairs to the bedroom - large bathroom and dressing area OMG!!! Everything is OTT and fabulous if you like that kind of thing. Beds are situated opposite the window and the curtain upstairs and downstairs opened by remote, as did the door. Even the tv's rose to the occasion when remote was pressed - very James Bond.We stayed half board, breakfast was out of the world with views to match.Dinner fabulous we ate in the JUNSUI restaurant - beautiful - cheapest wine \u00a3100 yikesThe private beach is breath taking, we were escorted to our beds - white towels laid,white leather roll for head rest - then we we brought a little box which contained bottles of ice cold water - ice & cold rolled white towels. You lay in the sun and enjoy the sun, staff pass by and offer you ice lollies FOC, the sea is so hot & not a stone in sight. I have died and gone to heaven.Quiet, Restful and just beautiful. The on beach toilet was like being in a hotel room - showers,toiletries,including tooth paste people,hairdryer & plastic carrier bag to place your costume.Skyview Bar - on the 27th Floor was fantastic.We sat down and immediately a member of staff was there - she past the drinks menu & we started to laugh as the beautiful dimmed lights meant we were having difficulty reading the menu. We laughed and the air conditioning meant we felt a little nippy. Your not going to believe this next bit - the member of staff asked what glasses number we were & returned with - GLASSES - DESIGNER WRAP TO TAKE THE CHILL OFF & LITTLE LIGHTS THAT CLIPPED TO THE MENU - beat that - I still laugh now when i think about it.All greatly appreciated - thank you Burj for being so thoughtful, you really think of everything.When we arrived all the seats looking out over dubai were already taken as soon as someone left one of the staff came over to see if we would like to move - YES lol, Dubai all lit up at night what do you think lolOur Butlers were lovely, they new our name - and each time we left the room and returned everything was replenished. Nothing was too much trouble. Not a snooty person in sight.This was a dream - I had said this would be a one off and we saved and decided to go for it. And it was worth it. and i will return again.This service is impeccable. For my friends birthday Staff arrived with flowers - cake - sparkling non-alcoholic drink & singing staff with violin playing - thank you Burj (you know how to make someone feel special). They take \u00a3600 up front charge and refund what is not used at the end of your stay.The 24 carat gold ipad a nice touch.The Cars on call to you lol - unbelievable.There is so much to see and photograph in this hotel - hope you have lots of room on your camera's or phones.We were Happy to live like the rich for a few days lol I could go on but i need to stop - if you would like any further info please e-mail meThey describe this hotel as \"The worlds most luxurious hotel\" this statement sums it up.Two words to anyone thinking of going - BOOK NOW!!!"

The good news is that the bar has spectacular views of the city. Second, it's expensive. There is a minimum charge at the bar so expect to spend $100 plus for a couple of drinks and appetizer plate. I looked at the menu and the cheapest entr\u00e9e was right at $100. But exquisite doesn't do justice to the experience. They have spared no expense. Just to sit and people watch is an experience. To walk though the shops is yet another experience. An must see/do!"

They have two prices, 510 AED with champagne and 455 without. The afternoon tea is a 6 course of tasty treats. Our seating was at 1 pm, we were early so sat down around 12:30, I was very glade we had only had breakfast up until then. This experience is good, but you really do get lots to eat, so my advice is to come on an empty stomach. Our tea took nearly 2 hours, the harp player was extremely good and it was a relaxing afternoon with way too much rich food. I would agree with another contributor, the interior just seems slightly tacky. The fountains were cool, the service was exceptional and so was the price, $300 USD for two persons including tip is all the money for sure, but indulgence can only happen once at this location! I would recommend it, but only once!"

FULL DISCLOSURE: We did not spend the evening here; we were guests of a \"regular\" customer and he arranged for us to have a private tour of the space. And what a tour it was! WOW! We were taken to the Presidential Suite, a massive multi-room area that was literally fit for kings. Everything was attended to with perfection. Fittings, furniture, linens, materials: everything was tastefully and most appropriately chosen. The color scheme was out of this world. Very royal! Frankly, I believe anyone would conclude similarly if they spent any time here; many tourists come simply for cocktails or lunch or for high tea. They would all notice the same thing: exquisite attention to detail, perfectly appointed interiors and exterior spaces, well-trained and courteous staff, and zero tolerance for litter or anything out of place. The Burg is simply perfection. There is no other way to describe it. To many, it is THE iconic piece of architecture of Dubai. And when you are standing in the lobby looking up, you will understand why. It is magnificent! If for no other reason than to witness first-hand one of architecture's most recognizable structures, The Burg is a MUST SEE. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

We called up the hotel and checked for various meal options- High tea, Lunch, dinner .Finally we made a booking at Bab Al Yam restaurant for dinner which suited our schedule for the day. The hotel was grand and reminded me so much of Las Vegas Casino hotels. You only could go to the floor where this restaurant was located, plus since it was night we could not really enjoy the sea view from the hotel. The hotel exterior was beautiful lit with lights changing in color. Coming to the restaurant, the ambience was casual. The buffet menu was pretty limited for vegetarians considering the exorbitant price charged per person. There were exotic options for Non vegetarians though. Desserts were good in taste and variety. Overall we felt that dinner did not serve our objective, probably a lunch or a High tea option would be better when you can enjoy the sea view"

To you give an idea, it's as though someone had sneezed a load of colours on the design sheets and somehow they ended up fitting it out with a dash of gold, white gold and more gold. Following on from the initial deluded design you're welcomed by the statues- supposedly staff...Jumeirah Group are a fantastic hotelier and have some great hotels, but unfortunately it does not live up to the seven star status; do yourself a favour and visit their Jumeirah Beach Hotel counterpart which has better service, more aesthetically pleasing decor and is ultimately cheaper."

Arriving at the entrance (with the Rolls Royce's and Bentleys I think ) you instantly knew this experience would be like no other in the world. I certainly haven't experienced anything like it. Entering you see the amazing lobby with HUGE fish tanks (cue diver waving at us!) and the escalator. You also see the very special fountains where the water jets \"climb\" upwards. I saw a programme on TV about how they built the hotel and how they do the the type of water jet in the fountain. It's all quite complicated involving laminar flow, and shows the building and contents have been built not only to exude luxury, but to stretch the boundaries of luxury, with what lengths they go to to make this hotel the best in the world. It's both the big and small details. The lift to the skybar is wonderful as you can see outside, and its SUPER fast too. Entering the bar - wow what a view!! We were greeted and sat down in comfy seats. Only one of our party drinks alcohol - no problem, 2 of us were made fresh non-alcoholic cocktails and the 1 that drinks, had the champagne (poured with great care and attention, and theatre). The food. What can I say? It was AMAZING!!! Absolutely STUNNING, & SUBLIME and it kept on coming! We got the towers of food, but in between, we got a small plate or two. If we had wanted more we just needed to ask. Needless to say, we were completely stuffed by the end, without even having to ask for the towers to be refilled (I think we asked for a sandwich or two more, and one of the cakes). There is certainly enough food - no question there! The flavour combinations were well thought out and complimented each other, with skill only demonstrated in that of the best restaurants in the world. The tea menu and choices was vast, and showed a real understanding of the different teas, which were extremely high quality. We had around 3 different teas each. The presentation of the food, and the food itself was outstanding. Mini works of art. The service was excellent, attentive and friendly. The attention to detail in the whole experience was like nothing I have ever experienced, and I felt a very lucky lady indeed that I got to experience afternoon tea here. I believe its a MUST if you find yourself in Dubai and have something to celebrate (or even if you don't!!). I have been very lucky to have travelled to many areas across the globe, and had many wonderful experiences, but afternoon tea here has to be one of the highlights of my life. Come for afternoon tea here, you WON'T be disappointed!! Hope to return in the future"

The restaurant was on the ground floor with no real views. The food and service was good although we did have to be moved because of a family with noisy young children that started screaming.All in all the meal was AED 365 or around \u00a365 per person. In absolute terms it felt a bit expensive, but I guess for Dubai it was not unreasonable, but you are paying a premium for the Burg and frankly I am not sure it was worth it.KEY TIP: If you want the top floor afternoon tea look at booking it before you get to Dubai."

Dubai in general and the Burj are in our minds a cross between Disneyland and Las Vegas with generally less alcohol to be found. We came. We saw and we don't expect to go back.

            "review": "Worked here. Still fascinated.. Having worked at this hotel for some time I have had many experiences, some of which I would like to share. But where to start.. The hotel itself represents magnificence. Build in 1999 the hotel was a project that was declared as \"nation building\". This designation is well deserved as the cost of the hotel widely surpasses any financial break even that would be considered \"sensible\". Only the finest materials have been used for its construction which makes it still to date the most expensive single-purpose hospitality development. To put it simple, everything that shines here - IS gold..Practically all of the hotel parameters are off limits to the public. You want in; you have to pay. The \"cheapest\" way to gain access to the hotel is to enjoy \"high tea\" in the afternoon. This however should be booked in advance as it also is the main item blocked out by travel agencies to get their guests into \"the Burj\". Also recommendable is a dinner reservation in one of the hotel's 4 F&B locations available to non-hotel guests (cuisines: pan Asian [Junsui], Arabic [Al Iwan], International [Al Muntaha] - not to be confused with the Seafood restaurant [Al Mahara], which will seat you around a cylindrical fishtank filled with sharks and other exotic fish). Personal favorite is Junsui, the hotel's pan Asian restaurant: buffet style hot and cold, it offers everything you could ask for including live cooking stations and chocolate fountain. This restaurant has recently been refurbished and features now a modern approach to Asian interior. For the ones wanting to step by for a drink, SkyView bar is the answer; elevated 200 m above sea level it deserves its name: excellent views over the Arabian Gulf, The Palm Jumeirah island as well as part of Dubai Worls islands make it worth the visit. Even your standard cocktails with AED 70 - 85 (USD 20 - 23) are not exorbitantly priced, measured against the Dubai average. However, it speaks for itself that the bar enables you to also spend anywhere beyond AED 30,000 / USD 8,000 per head if you really tried... Again, reservation is a must - no guest list entry and you will not even make it onto the bridge leading up to the hotel.The Spa is another area available to the public - even though few people know about it. A day-spa membership can be purchased which enables you to use the hotel's beach, spa and gym facilities for the day. Prices may vary and are best requested directly from the hotel.For hotel guests a wider range of opportunities is on offer: the hotel is a suite-only hotel, offering 202 suites ranging from 1 bedroom over club suites, to presidential and royal suites. The latter two categories have a price range equivalent to a new, small car per night but therefore offer more space and amenities than you will ever need. In fact, only 2 royal suites are available in the hotel, each covering the top two floors on either side of the building. 780 sqm and multiple butlers will ensure that guests do not get claustrophobic during their stay.Different to other hotels, the Burj Al Arab has its own reception on each of the 25 floors (all floors and suites are duplex, therefore the actual number of floors is 50 plus helipad), to ensure utmost privacy is maintained. Every suite also comes with its very own 24h butler, who will cater to the guest's every need. The pool side restaurant, pools and shisha lounge are areas accessible to hotel guests only. Should you have a special request, the in-house concierge will be able to help; in fact should you wish to dine at an otherwise fully booked restaurant or intend to gain access to one of the member-only clubs in Dubai, chances are these guys will be the only ones in Dubai able to still get you onto the guest list. For guests seeking for the ultimate Burj experience a helicopter arrival/ departure to the hotel's own helipad is recommendable - if you are willing to spend a five-digit AED amount for your airport transfer that is. This will be your only chance - guest or not - to be able to access the helipad. Apologies: no marriage proposals, special dinners or your private photo session are possible here and the advertised tennis green with Roger Federer is exactly that, an ad and non-existent. Not even employees are allowed here and 95% of the hotel's staff will move on without ever having set a food atop. Now this is exclusive!Tip: Room rates are the lowest during the summer month and if booked in advance one might be able to snatch up a room for half its advertised rack rate."

Note: you are not given the food parcel in the restaurant, you have to collect your doggy box from the reception.

Reservations only made by e-mail and creditcard. Due to high demand : the earlier your reservation the more success. I\u2019ve made my reservation 3 months in advance ! Afternoon tea at Skybar is not cheap : 565AED/pp (125euro, 160$) but you\u2019ll witness the absolute experience in the most exquisite place of Dubai the next 2 hours ! Perfect service from your private waiter : a glass of Louis Roederer champagne served with a strawberry tart, a warm Chef\u2019s Carvery of the day, followed by finger sandwiches and soft buns (free refill), homemade scones, and extra desserts \u2026 all kinds of teas (and coffees) as much as you want.

For a self proclaimed seven star hotel you expect an incomparably amazing service but on arrival (we were 15 minutes early) we had to wait around in the lobby slightly aimlessly until someone came to get us to take us up to the top. Once in the Skybar we were given a window seat with amazing views. Seeing the views was definitely the best part of the experience, along with getting to view the inside of the hotel, which was absolutely stunning.However, the actual tea really wasn't that great. Most of the pastries/cakes went uneaten and the sandwiches were nothing to rave about. I have had far, far nicer afternoon teas for around \u00a330 per head at London hotels and felt that the Burj was counting on its location and decor to justify the \u00a388 / 520 AED per person price tag. They even brought us out the wrong tea at one point, which is no big deal, but again, when you are in a hotel that is boasting the only seven start service in the world, you expect to notice a difference. A plus point was that the waiting staff were lovely and did make us feel very welcome and valued. They even encouraged us to wait til midday before leaving so that we didn't miss out on the champagne that was included.To sum it up, I would say that tea at the Burj Al Arab is just about worth it if you're really keen to see the hotel and the views, but if it's an amazing afternoon tea that you want, then I'd say go elsewhere."

The ceiling is a mad pschedelic pattern of blue and geen lights, the Walls have a weird electronic circuit look in a 'what the future will look like' 1970's perspective. Aside from the lok pf the place and eccentric decor, the place is amazing, waited on hand on foot, treated like royalty, the waiters are knowedgeable and always ready with a smile and compliment, the bar snacks where like little pieces of heaven in the mouth.The cocktails though - considering their is a minumum spend -around \u00a350 ishper party member - this easily met if you have 3 or more cocktails- they are truly lovely - interesting mixtures of flavours and alcohol from Green tea to chocolate ice balls, from mango to pomegranite and all excellent.We had aa lovely couple of hours there, we were a paty of 4 and our bill was astrnomical - but hey - it;s the only 7* hotel in the world - what do you expect?I'd recomend it to anyone - PS if you're feeling exteremly flush and extravegant their is one cocktail on the menu that uses very old champagne, cognac and gold dust that comes in around \u00a33k - hows that for 7*!!!!"

We went to the restaurant up on the 29th floor, spectacular views, although would have been nicer during the day as it was too dark to see most of the surroundings. It took us a little while to choose what we wanted, but the waiter was very very helpful and we decided to go for the sharing meal, which consisted of steak and 3 side dishes. WOW, just wow, it was delicious, I can honestly say I have never eaten such a tender and soft piece of meat. It was cooked the perfection. Cooked on the bone, brought over to us on the bone, and was cut in front of our eyes and served to our plates there and then.It was simply delicious. It was pricey, but not as pricey as we thought it would be. It was EID on that day so we wasn't allowed to have any alcohol but I think we spent all in all \u00a3300 in GBP (FOR 2). I am glad we went as it really was a different experience. And the hotel itself was very unusual!"

It is supported by a full cantilever that extends 89 ft from either side of the mast, and is accessed to a panoramic elevator.In case in Dubai, don't miss to pay a visit to this great iconic building - Burj Al Arab"

She made arrangements with security to make sure they came straight to the front to pick us up. The company was still running late and she came to check in on us as we were waiting and she called the company to follow up on their location. At this point they were giving her negative responses and she was very determined to insure that they move quicker and pick us immediately. She even waited with us outside to make sure she actually seen the tour guide arrive and we got in and were set on our way.

The aquariums flanking the escalators were impressive, although I admit to not liking the idea of the fish being captive to the whims of the rich (but that's just me - I believe they live the life of Riley in those tanks and are extremely well cared for!).Despite all this, the whole thing felt very over the top. To the point of being tacky, in fact. Everything is glitzy and gold, with the bright candy-coloured panels in the atrium reminding me of a bag of M&Ms!

The Burj Al Arab has a daunting level of opulence. From the immaculately dressed staff who are on hand to answer questions, to the paintings and decorations on the walls,\u00a0 through to the aquariums to either side of the escalators, and the soaring level of the ceiling above,\u00a0 everything screams look at me! I can only imagine what the rooms are like as I'm unlikely to ever have the funds to justify a stay there.\u00a0 We were there for the high tea at the sky view lounge. The elevator for this service is towards the back of the hotel and gives you enough time to appreciate the money, sorry, lavish settings around you. A tip for those visiting is to get there early. Seating is on a first come, first seated basis. We had a 1pm sitting so got there at 12:30 and scored a window seat easily. The high tea itself is a fairly standard affair and nothing out of the ordinary for such an occasion. It's all very good,\u00a0 make no mistake, but you're not going to be blown away with what's presented on your plate. But come on, you didn't come for the food. You came for the experience and that's exactly what you get. Sitting high above the Dubai skyline you get wide, sweeping views of all around while you eat in air-conditioned luxury, sipping Louis Roederer champagne, and deciding which tea you want from the exhaustive listing. We gave the Supreme Oolong and Date Tea a go and can highly recommend both. All too soon you'll come to the end of your last course and it's time to pay the piper so get that credit card out. While there are different sittings,\u00a0 we at no point I\u00a0 the afternoon felt rushed to finish our food and drinks, and courses were only brought out once the prior one had been completed. For a bit of luxuriant fun,\u00a0 go to high tea at the Burj Al Arab. It's not cheap, but it's certainly a wonderful memory."

You can even make out Dubai's newest construction venture - 'The World' - dissappearing into the horizon.The afternoon tea consisted of a seven course journey, encapsulating various sweet and savoury palates. It would therefore be advisable to have a very light breakfast (or none at all) if considering afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab.The quality of the food went hand-in-hand with the level of service demonstrated by the waiting staff - who were more than happy to have a chat or ask about our stay. I also liked that we were in no way rushed and allowed to complete courses, take pictures and enjoy the experience at our own leisure.The food: lovingly and masterfully crafted; the service: attentive and jovial; the views: out of this world.

This was despite us saying it was my 50th - I guess lots of people are third for a special celebration, From arrival to leaving the service was first class . It was very personal - names were used my birthday was acknowledged by several of the team . Attention to detail second to none. Staff offered to take photos near the windows and we were very pleased with those as they took time and got great shots . I guess they have plenty of practice .You start with a glass of champagne - Louis Roedderer with a fruit tart was perfectly matched.The beef dish was replaced for me with a cheese and tomato option which arrived on quel as they had asked if there were things we did nt eat at the beginning. There was no need to remind staff and they remembered this when explaining sandwiches Sandwiches come next You can ask for more sandwiches if you like any in particular . Some of the the breads used were flavoured and unusual . All were very tasty .The tiny cakes were scrumptious and as it was my birthday an extra birthday cake with a candle arrived with a red rose . They lit the candle but thankfully non one sang! After taking advantage if photo opportunities we left by requesting a buggy to Madinet and on the way the buggy driver suggested a stop for more photos , He obliged and they are better than those from the bridge Don't hesitate for a once in a lifetime experience - having said that I would nt hesitate to go again it was a fabulous way to spend several hours. My one disappointment I definitely could not manage dinner that evening our last in Dubai "

Personally, i like it much more from outside, once you get in you got blinded by amount of kitsch, but I must admmit that construction inside as well is impressive. We got there just for cup of tea (most expensive cup of tea in my life), because without reservation you cant get in. We had it down in lobby, so we weren't on the top - that was overbooked and more expensive. Anyway, we had some finger food and sweets included with tea, overall it was ok. You must dress properly to get in here, so male with pants or jeans (covered knees), same for women, covered knees and shoulders."

We had the most wonderful experience from the moment we were picked up until the moment we were dropped off at the airport. We had the standard suite and it was breathtaking. We had a fabulous view and everything about the suite had the feeling of luxuriousness. Some previous reviews have said the decor is gaudy but we felt it was just right and perfectly in keeping with where you are. We stayed under the Summer Dreams package and while this is still ridiculously expensive we felt a package like this was well worth it because of all the benefits. We had breakfast and dinner included both days as well as a massage treatment each and arrival / departure transfers. We were so pleased that we had decided to book two nights as we felt you needed this amount of time to experience all of the facilities. The full sized Herm\u00e8s toiletries are an added treat! The staff were all exceptional and couldn't do enough for us particularly the butler on our floor Syed and the guy that set up our in room breakfast (Raza?) did an outstanding job. The beach for the hotel is fabulous and the swimming pool is lovely too with a nice view out over the water. We hope we are lucky enough to stay here again in the not too distant future!"

Being the only (I think?) 7 star hotel in the world we expected something very special. Unfortunately we were disappointed. Perhaps our expectations were too high. The hotel is beautiful, but nothing overly stunning on the inside, at least the area we had access to. High tea was good, but not great. There was lots of food to be sure, your usual high tea fare, and lots of very good teas to try as well. But we didn't care for some of the sandwiches etc. The view was somewhat disappointing as we were hoping to have a nice view of the palm island. We were seated on the opposite side to the islands and the day was very hazy with no clear view at all. Overall I would say our visit was ok, but not what we had hoped for."

            "review": "Complete disappointment. We visited Burj Al Arab on the 20th of September after booking a dinner at the Al Iwan restaurant. It was supposed to be a thematic Moroccan night. I'd like to start from the greeting itself- personally, I believe that the hotel staff greet people differently, depending on what clothes they have or which car they arrive in. A Ferrari stopped in front of us and, of course, all of the porters literally ran to open the door for the people inside. And we were treated indifferently since we arrived in a Mercedes. This whole thing left a weird mark on our experience from the beginning, but we decided to let it go.So, we were seated in the restaurant and with that ended the actual attention from the staff. For 550 aed per person, I would say that the food was on an actually low level, especially when we are talking about a 7-star hotel. It wasn't that delicious nor was there such a big variety. And the most surprising thing is that we even had to pay for the water, which is a bit ridiculous since all the other restaurants we visited offered complimentary water. The buffet was rather poor and almost boring. Plus, there was nothing Moroccan the whole night! Aside from all that, the service itself was nothing special- the staff was as if picking whom to be kind to and to whom to pay more attention and during the whole time, I felt like I was gifted with their presence, you know? I cannot believe that a hotel at this level would allow such poor service at the restaurant(s) inside.Overall, I would never repeat this again because, trust me, it isn't worth the money for the quality you get. Also, I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends- unneccesary waste of money and time. Honestly, in other restaurants in Dubai, you would be treated like Kings and Queens."

The decor of the hotel lobby is not quite my cup of tea (a little too extravagant for my liking) especially with the bright red, blue and gold colours. However, the restaurant is tastefully decorated. Ambience is great. Service is outstanding as one would expect in a 7 star hotel. The afternoon tea with champagne is a little pricey but well worth it. Everything was delicious. The choice of teas were great! The only minor setback would be the food served (apart from scones and desert) were a little cold. It's an experience dining and being in a hotel that's world class and I would recommend it. You need to secure your reservation in advance with a credit card booking as no vehicles/taxis are allowed into the hotel area without a print out or email copy of the booking. This is a good thing because it maintains the hotel's standards otherwise you will find tourists thronging the place. And reserve in advance for a table with a good view :)"

As far as I know the whiskey dated 1800 for one shot was something like \u00a3 70,000, same price as our Porsche car. And you get the glass and a certificate. On the 24th floor they have a cocktail that I drink- none alcoholic was \u00a32,000. The thing was, no price on ladies menu. Only if I know the price before drinking I won't drink it. God knows how much my husband pay for the restaurant.I notice there was no Arab staff. Everything was foreign staff. The water fountain, the carpet the wall everything was stunning. I never seen like it in my life.But ladies- it's worth of an experience. I can recommend. But be aware the weather outside is terribly hot like 45 to 50 degree, feels like inside the oven.I visited 2008.... (I can't entry on the year below)I'm not sure if you have to pay to view but if you stayed in- no pay for viewing."

I called and told them that I don't want to put my credit card number and expiration date. Sorry, this is not what we do in the States... They agreed to take the number over the phone but asked me to fax the copy of the card over. I felt this is reasonable than giving it electronically. With the high charges for their service, I think they can do better with the reservation for foreigners. Why don't they used the e-commerce for the payment???"

The Foyer is amazing with tiny fountains cascading down from upper floors to the ground floor, and giant Aquariums teeming with fish on either side of the walls alongside the escalators. The fittings in the Ladies & Gents are all solid gold. The ceiling was spectacular as was all the fittings and fixtures. We had Afternoon Tea there which was a reasonable price for all the food provided. Tea, Coffee, dainty sandwiches and a wide selection of cakes and pastries. All served on delightful crockery in elegant surroundings and fabulous views across the Arabian Gulf. As night approaches the whole of the Burj Al Arab lights up with an ever changing colour sequence, and huge flames of fire shoot up to the night sky on both sides of the entrance. I would love to have the funds to stay at this truly stunning hotel. Maybe one day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

We were only impressed by the hotel's huge atrium and the outside design of the building. If you really want to see the jaw-dropping opulence and no-expense-spared architectural marvel you\u2019d be better visiting the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi.The d\u00e9cor at the Skyview Bar is pretty unremarkable and the seats along the inner curved sofa slightly uncomfortable and not individual enough. Combine the lack of view with the sofa seat and then you may want to question whether that UAE 600 was the money well spent.Without the panorama afforded to the window seats there is nothing really unique about this venue and, ideally, inner seats should be priced at a discounted rate. You can get a window seat (these are allocated on the first-come-first-served basis) but to make sure be there up to one hour before your allocated time.In any case, the whole area of Dubai seems to be permanently enveloped in desert haze so even the views are not that clear.The canap\u00e9s are rather average though originally presented and quite plentiful. Don\u2019t get suckered into buying another glass of champagne for you will quickly inflate the cost of the visit before you even notice. The staff serving the food are extremely courteous and helpful.Overall, an attraction to be missed if you are on a budget or with limited time on your hands."

There are various course to the menu, at least six courses. You start off with a glass of Champagne and strawberry shortcake, then progress on to the other various courses. The whole Afternoon tea lasts about two and a half hours And was an amazing one and not to be missed if your looking for that something special to do. While we were there it was my husbands Birthday, and they presented him with a lovely Birthday Chocolate Cheesecake, which was a very nice touch.

But there are no facts written anywhere about the gold used, the fountain, carpets etc etc. I didnt like the idea of having a beautiful under water restaurant in the basement but not allowing the tourists even if they had breakfast in their hotel even though thats a different restaurant. Not everyone can afford to pay and eat at every restaurant. They could have kept admission fee for visitors if they wanted to have it less crowded.Also the MOST important thing was the SERVICE !! It SUCKS ! Even if we had paid for the visit and the food, we were served as though we were beggars. First of all the table were so small to fit 6 people on it then there was nobody who picked up the plates out there. The food was great but they treated us very badly. Being 7 star hotel they shouldnt have such negativity for asians or be racists. I loved the interiors but HATED the management out there !!"

I have always been a huge fan of the Burj, it's a beautiful place to spend an afternoon and I am so happy with the service etc. Firstly the atmosphere within the Burj is relaxing and calm, I have had a bad experience a few years ago when a group of tourists came to the area we were having an afternoon tea and were very loud and rude to the staff. This was a truly magnificent trip, the staff were welcoming, happy and calm which is needed in a Seven Star Hotel. The food is yummy and well prepared, there was an option to have champagne or non alcoholic where they offered Mocktails or Sparkling Date juice. The package offers 7 courses;1)Welcome Drink2)Starter Pastry3)Sandwiches4)Sorbet5)Hot Meal (Beef with potato) 6)Scones & Jam7)Pastries The package includes unlimited soft drinks, mocktails, coffee, teas and water until you finish the High Tea. There was a unique touch to the coffee served, we ordered 2 cappuccino's which had shavings of gold on the top. They also added a Dubai touch to the tea by having Date Jam with scones, it wasn't my favorite but I do think it makes a special touch. The best thing about this experience was the view, it was so beautiful and I was so pleased I saved up because this was a really great experience. Not only was it amazing but we weren't rushed, we arrived at 3pm and left at 5:15pm. We must have finished all of our courses by 5:45 ish but they didn't force us to pay and they were really friendly. I defiantly have to say that it's worth its money! Its 450dhs non alcoholic and 510dhs alcoholic, but with all of the unlimited drinks, brilliant service and wonderful atmosphere! I am so pleased and thank you for this amazing experience. They also asked us why we were there and if we were celebrating something, we mentioned my mums birthday and they added a complimentary cake for her, a really personal memory for us!"

I'd certainly make it a must do whilst you are in Dubai if you have the money to spare as it is well worth it for the experience! We also went to the Skybar afterwards for a drink which was lovely and also worth a visit, however we went at night so couldn't see anything but I imagine the views to be fantastic during the day."

Some might say kitsch or at least \"different\"..but is unique. Our room was huge: two floors, two bedroom, huge living room, dining room, office (with a 20\" Mac available) and a great view of Dubai, Burj Khalifa, the sea and the beach.Besides that, the service is of a 7 star hotel. You do your check in/check out in your room..no queues! There is always someone around to help and even to push the elevator button for you!The romantic packaged included a lovely dinner on a table specially set for us with roses petals and candle light. The food however was average..nothing outstanding as the rest of the hotel.Next day we had a couple massage that was amazingly relaxing! The experience was great.

As it was our anniversary I received a rose and a cake iced with 'Happy Anniversary' to take away, it really was special. Be sure the use the lift furthest away from the reception, as that's the glass lift that looks out to sea.We had a walk around the hotel afterwards and fountains and fish tanks are incredible.

A few pointersYou must take your booking confirmation with you.Dress smart - I was worried what was appropriate, I wore a knee length dress with sandals and a shawl. No videos in the main lobby, but photographs are fineIf you ask the reception to order a taxi, it won't be the standard Dubai taxi - something a little more luxurious, which will be a little more expensive!This is a great treat to yourself if you are visiting Dubai."

Met at the Aeroplane door for the premium Ahlan service, taken to a lounge for a drink while our bags were collected , escorted through passport control into our white Rolls Royce where our driver was waiting with a bouquet of roses for my wife. 9am arrival , early check in granted and our butler Jafer (the king of butlers)ran the Jacuzzi for us. Champagne and Anniversay cake delivered compliments of the team ( nice touch) . This couldn't have gotten off to a better start. Champagne afternoon tea and cocktails in the Skyview Bar (7 courses) .worth every penny. Went to Amal for dinner @ the Armani Hotel great Indian food,had Friday Champagne Brunch @ Nobu in the Atlantis phenomenal (Saffron Atlantis ) is a Brunch Rabble and try to palm you off with Jacobs Creek as champagne. ( walked out) Now 4:30pm and at N'Dulge day club , full on disco party, DJ and Shisha. Used the Burj S Class Mercedes to chauffeur us around. ( Good Value) though taxis are cheap. Saturday Spa , my wife had a La Prairie Gold Facial and Swedish Massage and said it was the best experience she has ever had in a Spa ( special thanks to Lauren) Lunch in the Burj beach bar (prawn tapas) sensational and breakfast in the Pool Bar cafe each morning was of the highest calibre ever experienced in a hotel, you have to see it to believe it. Trust me when I say this, any negative reviews about this hotel are from people who grudge spending money on the best things in life or who don't get allowed past the strict security.If you can afford a few days and it's a special occasion do it ,there is nowhere better and believe me I'm in the industry an nowhere else touches this for luxury and quality service. Many thanks to all our Butlers during our stay , our Chauffeur drivers and Spa girls for looking after us and making our stay extra memorable. Wouldn't and couldn't now stay anywhere else in Dubai. Adrian & Elaine Sharpe."

A hotel on a man-made island just off the coast.But it is so much more than that. It is an exercise in marketing (it put Dubai on the map) and declaration-of-intent from a small city with a smaller population that desired to be global. If I remember correctly, it was the 15th tallest building in the world when it was completed. And now, every time Dubai is mentioned, it is the Burj Al Arab that springs instantly to mind.As an added note, behind the special-canvas covered facade lies an atrium deep enough to swallow the Statue of Liberty with its pedestal.This review is not of a hotel. It is of a landmark. And a statement of intent of a city that wants to be number 1."

However what made it worst is that the whole building feels like a huge concrete bunker, stifling, no air.The pool they have is a dutch oven, no shade. It's better to stay at Madinat Jumeirah and have Burj Al Arab as a backdrop.However there was one thing that surprised me: full-size Hermes Toiletries including perfume.

You can see why it is a 7* establishment, it oozes modern sophistication and wealth. It is clear to see a fortune has been spent on this building. The waiters are eager to assist and are hot off the mark. Although, assistance getting to the correct restaurant/lift would be appreciated as it is a complex layout with a lot of lift/floor/escalator choices.  We went for afternoon tea and although the sandwiches and cakes were delicious (and refilled) it is not a meal so please view it as a snack.  If you have a desire to experience 7* service and decor then you must check this place out, but if all you want is a nice view and a meal, stick to the Khalifa and hit Chiji's as this is a very dear experience."

Smiling staff barred the way. Nor were we allowed to look outside at the pool area.The tea was nice but we were only offered seconds on the scones.The atmosphere was opulent and amazing and I would recommend it as a once in a life time indulgence.Hint- book for about one hour before sunset to see the Burj in the sun and lit up after sunset."

Unfortunately, Ramadan put a stop to the champagne but the replacement sparking date juice was delightful and it kept coming. The dishes served up for afternoon tea were very tasty and very well presented. We were on the 27th floor but the view, unfortunately, was very limited due to the haze. It is not cheap but for a one time experience, we thought it was worth it. The only downside was that there wireless card machine would not work with our Mastercard or Visa Card. So, accompanied by one of the waiters, we had to go to the ATM near reception to draw out some cash. The waiter informed us that we were not the only patrons having found ourselves in this predicament. All in all, a very pleasant afternoon though and we would recommend it. But, be prepared for the shock of the price."

Make sure you go for sunset! We then went to the seafood restaurant. Now, I'm not a seafood fan, but my husband is, so I'm not best placed to comment on the food, but I thought it was OK. We had seabass between the two of us- cooked in salt so it was very tender. The restaurant itself is an experience- you feel like you've just walked into the set of a james bond film- gold plated lift, someone to greet you when it opens, walking through a gold plated (see, a theme here!) tunnel before being seated next to a huge aquarium where you can watch sharks and other fish swim by. Staff were excellent in this restaurant- friendly and helpful. The only downside is that gentleman have to wear a jacket (they provided one for us when we got out of the lift!), this is fine, but they are not allowed to remove it at all- which doesn't make for too comfortable an experience. That's the only negative! Other than that..a great night out."

Myself and my wife enjoyed a fantastic stay in the Burj Al Arab last week it was simply stunning.I booked the gold package which included airport transfers, neck and shoulder massage, breakfast which was offered either in a restaurant or in our suite as was dinner with a romantic set up. We also received personal gifts and a selection of Hermes his and hers products. From the moment we stepped from the car and entered the hotel we knew we were somewhere exceptional, The lobby is overwhelming, visually amazing as you look up at the floors above. We were brought straight to our suite for our check in and we were blown away by the size and standard of it. The suite is over two levels the lower one consists of a large lounge area, an office area and a toilet if you have any visitors. There was fruit, pastries and a bottle of red wine waiting for us and during our stay we received some more fresh fruit canapes and as we were celebrating my wifes birthday a cake and flowers. The upstairs of the suite was magnificent,a huge bedroom with sofas, second minibar everything you could want. What really stands out in The Burj is not only do they have a large pillow menu they also have a mattress menu, I found the one on the bed very soft and we were informed that they provide a selection should we want to change the second one was perfect. We were offered the option of the butler unpacking our suitcases into the wardrobes in the dressing area separate from the bedroom. The bathroom had a large jacuzzi, massive walk in shower and twin sinks and at every turn Hermes products. We had stunning views out towards The Palm from our suite. The spa was great, the pool on the 19th floor while small was perfect with great views. After travelling overnight the massage was very welcomed. You are transferred to the beach by buggy and it was like stepping into a warm bath. We had afternoon tea which was without complaint, lovely selection of pastries and sandwiches, with unlimited selection of teas, coffees and iced drinks. Later on we had cocktails in the skyview bar before enjoying a meal in Al Muntaha.After dinner the butlers prepared our lavender jacuzzi while we went for a stroll, a great end to our first day. Next morning we had a perfect breakfast in Bab al Yam restaurant down by the pool. While in the hotel our every need was meet by a brilliant team of butlers, the room was kept spotless by diligent housekeeping who cleaned and vacuumed several times both days. Though there was a lot of service in the room it was never intrusive and a click of the remote displayed a do not disturb sign, on the remotes which there were three they all controlled every function in the suite. I can not say with enough words how much we enjoyed our stay in the Burj Al Arab it was truly the best hotel experience I have ever had. Yes it is expensive but it is worth every cent. Special mention must go to the team who looked after us on the 20th floor and also all the staff around the hotel who all were professional and friendly. A lot of reviews of this hotel are based on the afternoon tea experience and I noticed some good some bad, but trust me to stay as a guest the experience is brought to a whole new level one I would highly recommend to anyone who loves travel and who loves to experience the best that is available. Thank you to all in The Burj Al Arab for a wonderful stay."

Once inside, look up the soaring atrium and enjoy the use of color throughout. We were warmly greeted by three hostesses dressed in Arabian fashion and ushered to our suite on the 16th floor overlooking the Persian Gulf. Three butlers stood guard at the entrance to the floor and we were told that they were there to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. When the door opened up to our room, much to our surprise, we had a duplex fitted out in royal colors of purple red and gold. Rich woods and gold fixtures completed the design. The bathrooms were done in marble and mosaics - get the picture - NO expense spared. We were even supplied with a MAC. The room was really \"fit for a king.\" Using the old cliche, \"you have to see it to believe it\" is apt here!The fitness facility is outfitted with every type of equipment you could possible want to use and trainers are available to work with you should you wish. We took a quick peek inside the indoor pool located on the same floor as the gym and it too looked terrific. Hint - If you have the chance to stay here make sure you ask a butler to tour you throughout the hotel. The restaurants are unique and worth seeing - especially the one at the top which has sweeping views of the Gulf. With only one night here, our budget didn't allow for us to dine at all of the restaurants, but it was a treat to see them."

I wished I could eat all the yummy cakes, but impossible, service was great! Yes it is expensive, but not that different in price from the ritz or claridges, so if you want to spend a afternoon eating lovely food, book it! I had iced coffee, it was perfect!"

Most of the time you couldn't see most of Dubai because of the mist. Also you can't get good pictures with your phone - you always come out dark. Also, beware of the take away sweets. You are supposed to get 2, if you are two people. Everyone else got 1 for each person on the table, except us. We still left them a tip but one should expect at the restaurant of a 7 star hotel to not be cheap, at least. I'll definitely not come back to this hotel. And I wouldn't recommend the overpriced experience, cause you might end up with not getting even what was in your package deal. Other than that the wifi was really strong. The food was really good. The view when available was really nice. The staff seemed nice, but it's possible that they were not genuine, since they brought us only one to-go sweets."

We visited a jewelry boutique and made a cheeky enquiry about a diamond ring - it was US$2.5m \u2026 only!Up the restaurant, it was amazing. Very nicely laid out with the most beautiful panoramic view. The staff were excellent and very polite. The food is tip top and the variety too many to count. I just try to consume as many types of food in small portions.The oysters were exquisite - the best I have tasted so far - I had half a dozen, could have done more if I were younger! I would give the sashimi a miss - can't beat those in Japan. Roast beef was very nice. I particularly like the canap\u00e9 food. I basically took one of every type. It was excellent and the attention to detail made it more enjoyable. You can also get cooked upon order dishes like foie gras, risotto, spaghetti etc We ordered a champagne and were served complimentary coffee and tea individually.

While travelling with the cart we will passed by the large hotel complex with its beautiful beach and scenery. Also always booked the restaurant prior to the time you want to go there, as the strict checking at the gate of the hotel would not let anyone pass unless you show them the booking print out which are sent to our hotel email once you booked them,, and have your credti card ready as they need your credit card number to book the restaurant."

We did get a table by the window over looking the sea however as it was dark there was nothing to see. However the staff were great and as soon as a table by the other window came free they moved us over.You receive complimentary snacks ( a snack tower in the shape of the hotel) consisting of mini quiche, salmon on toast, olives and a variety of nuts.As we had mentioned when booking it was an anniversary they also kindly bought over a small slice of cake and a rose - very sweet touch.The drink menu is more of a small book with alot of choice. We opted for a beer each until we had had time to digest the menu. I tried a 'Milky Way' a minty milky very potent cocktail served in a martinin glass it was 155 AED (\u00a327) a little pricey but it is a 7 star hotel. The beers we drank were priced at 70AED (\u00a312) these were the cheapest on the menu and very tasty (much better than a pint of larger)The staff were very welcoming and made you feel very comfortable whilst there.They ask that a minimum spend of \u00a350 per person when visiting - which for a one of experience i thought was reasonableReally enjoyed it.Have to say the gold plated 'wet floor' sign was a little OTT yet very apt for the hotelLoved it"

I was a bit surprised by the interior of the hotel, I didn\u2019t know what to expect from the world\u2019s only 7 star hotel but I know I wasn\u2019t expecting what I saw. It looks as if Midas got inside and touched everything as there is enough gold to actually make it look gaudy. Perhaps being used to NYC I was expecting swanky, instead the lobby was almost reminiscent of a cruise ship interior and the Skyview Bar had a space age computer d\u00e9cor that looked dated. Since you can freely roam the lobby without a time restraint after tea I would recommend making it upstairs on time for tea since you can only stay for a limited time at the Skyview Bar. The view is not as spectacular as some other places but you do get to see the aqueous blue sea on one side and the yellow arid desert and cityscape on the other. The tea IS certainly a ceremonious 5 course affair (actually 6 courses since they brought out a complementary cake for my aunt along with a rose) and the waiters are super attentive constantly asking if you would like refills or to try another tea/coffee. The finger sandwiches and desserts are creative and filling and served with quite a flair, but taste wise the food is just average which considering the seven star rating and the bill is a bit underwhelming. Since I went to celebrate a significant birthday for my aunt I\u2019m happy I got to give this experience to her as a gift. The uniqueness of the experience and the pampering from the wait staff justified the hefty bill on this special occasion. If however I had come for the food, or the view, or perhaps just on a regular day (and not a special occasion) I feel that I would have been considerably disappointed. If you are visiting Dubai to indulge in its luxurious, over the top opulence, with no regards to expenditure, then go ahead and have tea at the Skyview Bar. If you are at all budget conscious then I would say skip it, there are far more things to spend on in Dubai."

The famous Burj al Arab Hotel was naturally on the list - only to be gained access to if you have a booking of some kind to enjoy what this world legendary hotel has to offer. We opted for the morning breakfast in the Sahn Eddar Restaurant at lobby lounge 1st floor level. Pricey, yes but we were not disappointed!Apart from the very chic, delicious 5-course breakfast offering in absolutely plush surrounding, and top class silver service, complete with morning traditional live band, the hotel entrance and ambience blew us away. We got trigger-happy with the camera, because the sheer architecture, the boutique-style fountains, the open atrium interior reaching sky-high, the magnificent flower arrangements and the mix of colours in decor, is any photographer's dream.It is clear that the architects and developers of this property had carte blanche to create what is rightfully called a world iconic masterpiece of art (in our view) on its own man-made island. We were understandably only allowed to view the public areas on ground and first floors, but our visit was well worth it. If what is we saw in terms of opulence, is anything to go by, then a deeper dive into the innermost heart of all the hotel has to offer, can only be a sure attack on the senses.The High Tea on the top floor was also an option for us, but very expensive. The breakfast option-for-entry was a superb choice."

The tea is a 7 course offering of various items with champagne and unlimited drinks from a select menu. The staff in this hotel are superb and cannot do enough for you... this is a must when visiting Dubai."

We were here and I forgot to tell you !!!If you want a special treat for you and your loved ones and don't mind what it will cost you then this is the place to go. You will have to make reservations way in advance ( via their site) in able to get in. We were here last year in January and it was unbelievable. Some of our friends think it is way over the top, and maybe it is, but...it's special and if you are in Dubai you should consider going.We enjoyed a Friday lunch with our son and his wife who live in a neighboring country .We arrived around 13.00 and stayed until 18.00 at least. Enjoyed every minute of it. From entering the building until leaving the staff will treat you like royalty. Everything is done to perfection and to please you.. Visiting the ladies room is an experience by itself. The view from above is awesome.A couple of days later Hubby received an email to thank us for our visit and to ask if we enjoyed it. That is clever ! \"would we consider visiting again in the future ...? \" Yes, we will, next time we are in Dubai."

You also get a good view of the Palm and Dubai skyline. However drinks in the restaurant were astronomically expensive and price of the buffet was not value for money when compared to other places.

Visited April 2013.As you can only enter the Burj Al Arab if you are staying there, or if you have a booking for Tea or Dinner, it is an exclusive area and makes you feel special when you arrive. We were staying at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel so the buggy service will take you over to the Burj. This is handy we were dressed up and I had heels on so wouldn't have wanted to walk the 20 minutes or so in the afternoon heat. Our driver made a swift right turn onto a lawned area next the beach so we could have photos with the magnificent hotel in the background. He was snapping away and we got some lovely pictures. The tea itself was fabulous. Cocktails, teas, coffees, cakes, sandwiches, chocolates and even a roast chicken made into a Wellington style. We were full for the rest of the day.You are seated on the mezzanine level (first floor) and there are some beautiful jewellery and watch boutiques so we had a wander around after tea. There was also a lady playing harp during the time we were seated which was very relaxing and added to the lovely ambience. You can't help but look up as there is no ceiling but an open area to see all the floors above and I assume the room doors which were blue and gold with a round port hole window. 10 or 12 elegant Arabic ladies were meeting for afternoon tea in the same area and it was fascinating to watch them as they all looked so beautiful in their stunning traditional dress. This made a welcome change from the standard black habib that the local women wear. The toilets were encrusted with gold taps and beautiful marble and you felt like you were in a palace of some kind. All in all a great experience which I would recommend."

We didn't get table near the window, which didn't bother us because for photo's the flash would actually only bounce back, our waitress took as many photos of us as we wish and the back ground of the restaurant other tables was just divineA truly beautiful experience when visiting Dubai - Best of all, you get to browse the whole of the Burj!!!!!!!!"

There is a minimum spend of approx \u20ac60 per person (320 AED), it's not hard to reach this figure!!The building is mesmerising from it's innovative and unique design to the fine detail. On entering the building you are greeted by a waterfall, not an ordinary one, and walls adjoining the stairways brimming with tropical plants and fish.The human greeting is first class and they make you feel special. The bar area overlooks the gulf and faces back towards downtown Dubai which was wonderfully illuminated against the night sky.We had some champagne and cocktails.I can highly recommend the 5th Ave Slammer, the best cocktail I have had by some distance, worth the expense.We witnessed the indoor fountain when we were leaving. What an engineering feat. Spurts of water that resembled jumping fish of varying lengths and jumping to different heights. The \"fish\" splash onto the bowl (no ordinary bowl) which creates a percussive sound. I'm sure one of the sequences drummed out a Riverdance excerpt. Mesmerising, I could have watched it for a long time."

I have to say it was ok but nothing special really to what we have experienced in other hotels in other parts of the world. On arriving you have to check in by the lift for your time slot where a lot of other people have to wait at the same time. Once you get out of the lift it is very disorganised I felt with no place to sit and very cramped , you had to wait until others left the sky bar for you to then go in. The same although polite looked very scruffy and the uniforms looked very tired and dull, we had the food and cakes and champagne and as much tea you wanted to drink. The seating was very tight and if you had a sofa to sit on and your tall it will be very uncomfortable as it's lower than the table and no place to place your feet under the table. We stayed on the palm at zabeel saray which is part of the same group but I gave to say we had afternoon tea and champagne there at it was far better and much more comfortable and staff excellent and well turned out .Great building worth visit to look at , but looks very tired inside now compared to other hotels on the palm."

We were in Dubai for our honeymoon and we're not quite sure how the resturant found this out be we had rose petals on the table in the shape of a heart and were congratulated on our marriage by our waiter.. we wouldn't usually choose to eat in a place with these prices, as I said, we were on our honeymoon so we seen it as a one off but it was worth every penny, to experience how the other half wine and dine was great, service was great, food and drink was amazing.. would love to visit again one day.. maybe when I hit the lottery!!

They are the \"only restaurant in the world\" to serve Cristal by the glass. My husband and I are regular people who go to work everyday and have a nice vacation once a year.

My wife intially asked for gluten free food which was readly suppled, and they also gave her the gluten food as well.

(By the way, I believe going for tea is the most inexpensive way to access the Burj). Even taking tea in the lobby was very relaxing. The d\u00e9cor was very tacky, but fun, the music was very nice. After tea, we went to the \"gift shop\" expecting to buy a magnet or something. But this was not an ordinary gift shop. They were selling diamonds and things like that... as soon as we walked in we tried to leave, but the girl at the counter (who was clearly very bored) called us over and had us try on diamond rings. She insisted that I try on a five carat diamond ring! To be clear, she was in no way trying to sell them to us, she just wanted us to have fun.

I had read someone saying that the d\u00e9cor did look like a cruise ship and I would have to agree. The staff are the highlight - great service. The sandwiches had been refrigerated so they did not have that lovely fresh taste, and the rest of the food was nice but not great. I asked for another tea and we had to pay extra for this on top of the $148 aus that we paid. Its a lot of money for not much - I would save my money"

Yes, it's not cheap (\u00a383 each) but in this reviewers opinion worth every penny.Your made to feel special as soon as you enter this spectacular (and totally OTT) hotel. The entrance is amazing, two whole walls a giant fish tank going up the side of each escalator.The journey up in the elevator was a treat in itself, the glass walls availing you off all the amazing views around.Upon arriving on the 27th floor for 'tea' you are seated in a beautiful setting with some amazing views over the surrounding area. Everything about our tea 'experience' was carefully and excellently explained to us by our server Rueben (a wonderful chap). We started with a glass of champagne, followed by a small fruit canap\u00e9 then the real feast began! There are a whole host of teas and coffees available, all unlimited. A stand of sandwiches and mini rolls was brought out and each one explained, all were absolutely delicious and we were offered more if we wanted them! Next was a cake stand of treats (btw each stand is shaped like the hotel itself), scones, macaroons, jams and other delicacies. At no time were we made to feel that there was a time limit on how long we were there.We were then presented with a mini cake, with 'Happy Anniversary' on it and a rose for me.Finally, a most delicious sorbet; and a small box of chocolates for me to take away.What a beautiful afternoon, a MUST."

This is a genuine design and engineering marvel.You have two ways of seeing this from outside [3 ways if you also visit Wild Wadi next door ].1. Take a taxi or bus to Wild Wadi, one hundred meters before there is a viewing point for Burj Al Arab. There is a nice Air Conditioned waiting area for bus travelers too, though nearly every tourist took a time out here.2. Enter the Madina Jumeirah Souk. Enjoy the Souk Views, and ask for \"Al-Makan\" Lebanese Restaurant. The view of Burj Al Arab from there are excellent with the Arabian Palace Architecture in between, birds, flowers, a fountain and a small pond below as well to add to the ambience. Don't forget to munch Lebanese Pastries while admiring the entire view, and if the genuinely enthusiastic Mr. Riyaz is around, he will take excellent family pics for you."

The service is extrodinary from the time your walk through the door until you leave. The lobby is a wrok of art and its hard to focus as there is so much to look at.. from the huges aqauroims lining the escalators to the fountains, to the mulitcolor balconies to the luxury restaurants and shops lining the lobby verandah..Our suite had a private butler , as they work by floors and our Butler Rahim was stellar with suggestions for dining, taking care of unpacking, confirming flights etc..the service was unparalleled. Our suite had an office with, Mac computer, Fax, Bose sound system, multiple line phones and more gadgets than i can remember. As a tech savy travelers this was simply amazing. The suite had a bar, huge spiral staircase to the upper floor, gorgeous huge shower and bathrooms and huge bedroom with attached lounge area. The room had remote control blackout curtains as well as a remote control pop up flatscreen in the bedroom. There was even remote controls for all the lighting, AC. THe views were to die for an of course we could see the famous Jumeriah Palm manmade islands from our suite a s the huge highrises from the Jumeriah Lakes tower areas as well. The Burj Khalifa was on the other side of the buiilding some I am sure there was a view of that too but our suite faced the other direction. Please keep in mind this hotel is not for everyone however as its use of very bold colors and excessive use of gold plating is a matter of taste,. Like my title says this place is really \"over the top\" but its done so well it works.If you want to splurge once in your life this is the place to do it. Bring your cash though as it ultra expensive!"

We had dine in to 5 different resturants including the skyview etc.What I love about this hotel are the restrooms even for the resturants are super nice,it's different and it matches per theme of the restrooms. THere is no paper towel because they use actual hand clothes that is nicely placed on the vanities. There is free hermes perfume and lotion that you can use. The designs are great.Food wise.. ummm it wasn't that memorable.Exeptional service with the staffs except for the ones in the lobby when we asked for paper bag they gaVe us hard time just for the paper bag.

The Afternoon Tea itself was delicious. We were served champagne, a berry tart, a fillet of beef, as many sandwiches you could eat, cakes and pastries and sorbet. Along with as many non-alcoholic drinks as we wanted. The waiters were very attentive, happily taking photos, checking dietary requirements etc. The views were stunning. We didn't have a window seat but we could still see and appreciate the views. As we were on honeymoon, they gave my husband a red rose to present to me. And we noticed that anyone who was celebrating a birthday/anniversary etc were given a small cake and a rose so let them know if you are celebrating. When we left, they gave us a small box of chocolates to take away with us. You can also take away the cakes you can't manage to eat.

The service and food was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed the whole occasion feeling rich for one day, but realistically you do actually have to accept it will be eye watering to take a family of four (2 teenage girls) for lunch even with the vouchers. Book before you travel if it is somewhere you really want to go and you do need a reservation to cross the bridge to the hotel, you can't just rock up to the foyer to take pictures of it. The lift to the restaurant is a ride in itself as it is on the outside of the building overlooking the sea so not for anyone with a fear for heights, but there are other restaurants you can book. A bottle of water was \u00a310 and a glass of champagne was \u00a390, overall the bill was \u00a3500 but if you are booking a meal here then you are doing it for the whole experience which you have to take into consideration and they are happy to let you take as many photos as you like while you are up there."

We reached about 30 mins ahead of time just outside the driveway of the iconic hotel. We got ample time to click some shots of the hotel and also the Jumeirah Beach hotel. Our high tea was at 7:40pm. We entered the hotel and spent some time in the main lobby. Then we went another level up and were shown to our table - like a coffee table with lovely sofas around it. Our high tea was served in courses including cakes, pastries, scones (the best), varieties of jam, fruit cocktails, date drink (yummy), apple cider and ofcourse choice of tea in the end. The overall experience was memorable. The service was excellent. "

The only way we could get in was to have tea in the lobby (must be over 12 years old to go to sky bar). The service was terrific - complementary chicken nuggets and fries for our son while dined in style which runs 450 AED / person. A pricey tea nonetheless but made for an enjoyable afternoon. Food was very good. High tea at Ritz Carlton, London still the best in my wife's opinion."

It's a unique man-made creation and have been known to be one of the famous landmark of the city. Hit the taxi and drop by at the public beach near the burj al arab. FYI the public beach is not that pleasant and neatly maintained, hence, choose to be at the JBR, which is also a public beach without any cost. Bring your own beach umbrella, beach mat and food.

It was a truly a great experience and the views from here were incredible. Impeccable service during the tea, with the staff always referring to me by name any time they approached my table. The food served during the tea was delicious and incredibly filling. The scones and desert tray was so good! Scones, cookies, creme brulee, macaroons, cakes, and chocolates....wow!! The Burj Al Arab serves more or less as a symbol of Dubai and the luxury found in the city, so I could not pass on a chance to get the experience and I was definitely not disappointed. Plus being able to walk into the hotel, which by the way you can't do without a reservation, and see the attention to detail and beauty of the hotel was also worth it!! If you can do this while in Dubai I would definitely recommend it! Loved it!"

Warm welcome by staff, we got a nice big table for the 6 of us, and the procedure of the high tea was explained to us. First a berry tart from the kitchen,a glass of bubbles , then little savory treats , followed by sweet pastries and chocolates. The waiters go around all the time, so you can eat as much as you like. Great variety of tea and coffee, all done nicely. After 2 hours, we left, the ladies with a box of chocolates as a gift. It was a nice experience for a price of 560 dirham. That is quite hefty, and though it was all nice food, the value wasn't up to this. But it's the Burj Al Arab, and that's what you pay for"

This place is locked up like some sort of paranoid embassy for some hardline state and is very off putting. Despite being well dressed and waving money at them with the intention to splurge on a lovely breakfast (yes we could afford it), they would not let us in after we traveled from the other side of Dubai to get there by taxi. I've never been refused entry anywhere before in the world (I've done 7 star hotels in India) but this place is nothing but a vile lair of ugly snobbery for the Elite. I cant believe that they promote this place on all the marketing for Dubai yet they have this elitist policy of refusing people entry who are the very people they are trying to reach in their marketing. This occurrence has put me off from loving Dubai (which I was on the way of doing after the Burj Khalifa, The Dubai Mall and the Dubai Creek) and I started to see the ugly side of Dubai of which there are many aspects. These range from the lack of basic pavements for its pedestrians, to the horrible way they treat its workers as a sub class (we saw police beating them up), and all the empty buildings that were made just for show (how pretentious). Whenever I tell my friends of Dubai, I am sure to include the ugly side of elitist snobbery of Dubai as well. We saw some wonders there but this experience outside the Burj Al Arab left me with a bad taste in my mouth.To the owners of Dubai. Perhaps you should remove reference to this building in your marketing so you don't greatly disappoint other tourists when they come to be let down and turned away at your the door of this highly publicized attraction. Don't bother with this place unless you know some world leader or can be vouched for by someone like Bill Gates or Richard Branson."

One tip is go when it is still light outside, 6pm views will be even more spectacular..... And you will see the sunset"

When we said it was my birthday I was given a beautiful red rose and a small cake with a candle. The waiter made sure we knew exactly what to expect, the tea was excellent - so much lovely food it was impossible to eat any dinner! The ambiance was wonderful and at no time did we feel rushed. The staff were happy to take photographs for us to record the event and we were lucky to see the sun setting. After we had eaten we were able to wander around the lower parts of the hotel; enjoy the fountains, shops and just soak up the atmosphere.

We got a taxi from our hotel, showed the reservation at security and from then on it was superb. We were treated like royalty. The foyer has an aquarium on either side and there are various fountains etc and of course very opulent decor throughout. There are also several very high class shops. We were shown to a lift and then taken to our table ( we had requested a window seat if possible) and we had a marvellous view over the Arabian sea, as well as the city skyline with the Burj Khalifa dominating. We had a huge sofa with cushions and also two chairs. There were three of us. First of all we were offered a glass of champagne or either a bellini or a kir royale. A plate of stuffed dates was brought - absolutely delicious. Then tiers of sandwiches were brought in. We got the same amount as for four people so rather more than if we had been a couple. The sandwiches were served on different kinds of bread and included curried egg, cream cheese and cucumber, salmon and caviar, chicken, beef and possibly another I can't remember. Then came a small plate with a slice of beef with mashed potato. This was the only thing I would have done without. It seemed a little strange to have with afternoon tea but that's just my take on it. The others in our party loved it. Then came the cakes ! There were two different scones both warm served with little dishes of clotted cream, apricot jam, strawberry jam and date jam, all delicious. You would get two each but we had 8 between three of us. There were various cream cakes, beautifully decorated and it is a huge disappointment to me that we could not manage to eat them all. We then had a sorbet. Throughout we chose from a large menu of different teas and coffees, all unlimited. The service was as professional as you would expect but friendly too. We could not fault the experience and would thoroughly recommend it. Book in advance, I'm sure you will not be disappointed. On leaving the hotel we asked one of the doormen to get us a taxi. It was nice to have a taste of luxury for once."

From the opening champagne drink to the closing delectable scones, jam and cream the food served was delightful and, though a tad expensive, well worth the extra. After Tea we were fortunate to be taken up to the top of the hotel to sample the magnificent view of the coast and the city. What a place, what a Tea - so glad we went!!"

The Burj Al Arab brings a whole new meaning to \"high tea\" with it being served in their 27th floor Sky View Restaurant with stunning views right up and down the coast line of Dubai.The setting is spectacular and the food (of which there are many courses) is excellent. The service as you'd expect is second to none, and the whole experience from your first view of the atrium and reception to the checking in experience is first class!No trip to Dubai should be without this experience."

I love my afternoon teas and this is the best I've ever been to! We got there half an hour early and took photos outside of Jumeirah Beach Hotel and a few photos as well (you cannot enter the grounds without a reservation so get your pics then). A beautiful oval glass lift took us up to the 27th floor and I recommend getting there early to get the best seats. We had seats overlooking the beach and the Jumeirah Beach hotel at the window. We had a fantastic waiter called Tarik. The first course consisted of divine sparkling date juice (we don't drink alcohol) with beef and mash and veg terrine for me. Then came the yummy sandwiches, which was topped up and then the cake tier. And finished off with a desert. Not forgetting lots of hot and cold drinks throughout.I has little chocolate cake with 'Happy birthday' and a candle lit and a red rose for me. And everyone got a little take away box with chocolates. Very intimate and luxurious experience. And not forgetting free wifi! Expensive, yes. Worth it, definitely!!"

Embarrassing? You bet! Visitors to the building aren't actually taken all the way to the top when they take the tour...and, once you get as far as you're allowed, there's not that much to look at apart from a sunburnt land with a blob of urbanity in the middle. But, hey, if you like very high buildings and want to say you've been there, it IS kind of cool. Me, I'd rather have remained on a banana lounge by the pool in the very gorgeous, very comfortable Palace Hotel, Downtown Dubai, from whence we ventured forth."

It is supposed to be the most expensive hotel in the world and I can understand that considering there was 24K gold leaf detail among other lavish decorations. The design is so stunning and the decor just as much so. You cannot leave Dubai without seeing this building - The Jumeirah Beach Hotel (wave hotel) next door has a great view for picture taking (just an aside). Now for high tea - I've only had high tea once before in my life and this experience far surpassed that one and I doubt I will ever have a better high tea experience. Honestly, where else can you see the World Islands while getting served the most delicious 7(ish) course meal. The food was unique, the presentation beautiful, but most importantly it was delicious. And I am a somewhat picky eater and I could enjoy most of what was provided to me. Highly Highly recommend. Once in a lifetime experience."

I booked a Well Being massage (1 hr) and the price of the treatment included use of the spa facilities both before and after the treatment. Following the treatment I was offered a selection of teas and during the course of my time in the spa water and apples were readily available. The treatment price also includes free use of towels, a bath robe and slippers. My treatment cost 900 dirhams (approx. \u00a3150) which given the location, the length of the treatment, the facilities and the impeccable service was definitely worth it. I attended the ladies only section as I was going on my own. Unfortunately I am not sure whether there is a mixed section but if you contact the spa on BAATalise@jumeirah.com you will be able to find out."

In doing this, I don't know how much of the rest of the hotel you can visit \"on your own\". The other option is to book a \"tour\" (that may include a tea service or a meal). There are a number of local companies that have various options and may include other sights in Dubai. Make sure you are going inside the hotel and not just \"photographing\" the hotel. You can book on the Internet, your own hotel concierge or from a local tour company around the city. But, we compared rates and booked a tour on viator that included breakfast. Even though it was a \"group\" tour, there were only two couples in the van. Each couple was seated at our own individual table for breakfast. Then we had about an hour tour of the hotel from top (bar) to bottom (restaurants). Quite an amazing place."

They offer high tea and cocktail reservations.It si a beautiful sight in the night, when it gets all the colored lighting. It is poplar spot with Russian oligarchs and their wives, or mistresses..no matter which there are tons of Russians..It is claimed to be a seven star hotel, but it is is 5 star indeed, so much for stretching the truth.The price however, suggests otherwise."

We enjoyed the most amazing cocktails in the late evening, and ordered a full dinner as well. The trick is that while reservations for high tea or dinner might be hard to procure, the right hotel concierge can get you a spot for cocktails at the bar. As long as you order from the kitchen before midnight, there is a marvelous tapas selection available."

I mean... get ready to have your mind blown. It's really exquisite. Amazing blend of modern and traditional architecture. Words really can't describe it, so I'll include a couple of pictures below. A couple of things to note - you can't just drive up to this hotel and walk in. You need reservations. There are a few options for that. One is a drinks reservation at the skyview bar, which runs you a minimum Dhs 250 (USD $ 68 @ 3.66 Dhs per $) per person. The Skyview was a nice place up near the top of the hotel, as the name implies. We didn't actually get reservations here, but a bunch of my friends did. At the same time, we had reservations at the Lobby Lounge for drinks and snacks and so forth. I think the most impressive part of the hotel is the lobby, so it was pretty awesome to sit down there and enjoy the view over food and drinks. The package there was Dhs 200 per person. There's another option to have tea at the hotel and that was like Dhs 300, maybe? Tea is served also in the skyview area, but more in the evening than at night. Whatever you choose, once you're in the hotel, you can view all the common areas, which include the ground floor and main lobby floors. Basically there's some shops, fountains, and an aquarium and so forth. It's worth seeing. You won't be able to go to other restaurants like the Skyview if you only reserve the Lobby Lounge. We actually cheated and went up to meet our friends who were still chillin' up there after we were done and so we got to see it. Overall, this place is a must see; just be sure to book in advance.I went around the rest of Dubai and Abu Dhabi and wrote about that here:http://myideasmyobservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/my-trip-to-agra-delhi-dubai-and-abu.html"

Whilst the Burj Al Arab may be known as the '7 star hotel', getting to and from the hotel represents a bit of a logistical challenge. Unless you have a prior reservation at the hotel as a guest, or to dine at one of the restaurants, you are not even allowed onto the hotel grounds. On the day that I visited, there were throngs of visitors, with a constant stream of tourist busses dropping visitors outside the gates for a brief photo op of the hotel. Sadly, I had not made a reservation and was unable to secure a spot for afternoon tea or drinks at the bar later that evening. This is when the logistical nightmare began. It soon proved to be impossible to get a cab from the Burj back to the city centre. After spending 40 minutes waiting outside the gates for a taxi, myself and groups of other stranded visitors began trekking through the streets in the vain hope of finding either taxis or public transport back to the city. Thankfully, an off duty taxi driver took pity on the group and drove us to the closest sky train station. So whilst I can't comment on the experience of being inside the Burj al Arab, the logistics of getting there and back can be challenging. If you're planning on visiting the Burj al Arab, I would definitely book in advance, and secure transport to and from the hotel. Otherwise, you may end up having spent a few hours looking at the hotel from the outside, and wandering about trying to find transport back to the city."

Dinner/Lunch is quite expensive there but one time tea and breakfast were kind of in-reach for traveler like us. At the time of booking we were told that proper formals are strict in Lunch and Dinner restaurant, however smart casuals can be wore for Tea / Breakfast time (no shorts, no sport shoes). As we all were in Holiday mood, we did not carry any such dress with us so could not get a chance to go in their restaurant but will try it next time I visit Dubai."

It was Christmas time and the hotel was done up beautifully. Otherwise also the interiors of the hotel are done up very nicely. Beautiful fountains, chandeliers, work on the floors. Gold has been used very lavishly....The staff was courteous. Can't comment on the food and rooms as we couldn't afford either of the two. But yes if one can get a chance a visit is a must."

The bill was about \u00a3100 for 6 cocktails which yeah, is a bit steep, but you're paying for the once in a life time experience. The toilets even have Hermes body lotion for you to use! Totally gorgeous and defo worth the visit."

Its same restaurant like Sky Bar(no entry chidlren under 21 yrs!) and you can enjoy great view to Dubai. Food was nice, but service its really not great,its not cheap restaurant, but any restaurats in lower level are more better by the service. Maybe we dont lucky to staff, BUT BUT BUT, its 7 star hotel...For couples without children is really nice take Afternoon Tea time and be there over sunset, amazing view, really!"

We have stayed in Dubai many times as we live in the UAE, we have never been treated as we where last Saturday on a visit to the Burj, my husband has been before for a drink, deciding to take me to show me how beautiful it was, we hadn't booked a room but you would think tourists would be allowed to have a drink or something to eat. We arrived at the gate house only to be shunned away and told we needed to book for a meal, my husband informed the security guard that he would ring now and book, the security man turned on his heels and said you are improperly dressed, Saturday lunch time, 90degrees...what do they want a suit, my husband had a shirt and trousers on, I was covered up respectively, a couple behind us also got the same treatment, absolutley disgusted, if that's the attitude before you go in I'm very happy to never have the pleasure! Take yourself elsewhere, we did and had a great time."

The champagne, food and service were very good too, but the view makes it all worth it. Get there early so you get to choose one of the outer seats near the window looking towards the city. Hang around downstairs after and take lots of pics and make sure you visit the cool bathrooms. Overall, a fun experience you should do once!"

The views are fantastic as is the evening dancing to music fountain show, this is free lasts a couple of minutes,every 20 minutes, if on a cruise you can use the free shuttle bus to the Dubai mall from the port, the bus even picks you up from the underground car park for freeeeee"

Though it's a hotel, but I am putting it under attractions just for the reputation it has achieved. The hotel is extremely exquisite and expensive, but a treat to senses. Even if you can't afford to get inside it make sure you absorb it from outside especially in the nights. I wen to dubai recently with my buddy who I luckily bumped into on traveldaddy.com .. It was one of the best trips I ever had. The hotel is built on an artificially made island linked through a road. It also has a tennis court right on top of it! Its always over booked, so make sure you get a booking lot in advance to be able to have that breakfast or anything!"
