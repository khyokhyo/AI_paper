Given the weather it was cooler to do it in the evening but in addition taking in the sunset while taking a slow cruise down the creek is lovely.We had young children with us and were concerned with safety and life jackets. They do not have kid-size jackets on board. We were worried about the many boats on the Creek and possible accidents. But the rise was slow and safe.As it is engine-powered, it is quite noisy and the seats in front of the driver are particularly hot."

After the Deserts and the amazing buildings we went over to Dubai Creek for authentic old Dubai experience.The Creek has a boat service which gets you for a low cost from one end of the creek to another. The calmness of the place was awesome. The Bur Dubai Abra dock is one of the docks in the creek. Nice place and friendly people. Do checkout the shops nearby selling authentic Dubai merchandise, also don't miss out on a chance for some nice Hookah and Tea (chai)."

I've been to Dubai for work so many times, but it took a trip with my family to finally get round to an abra trip.It's an easy walk from the metro to the dock, and the trip is very well worth the VERY small amount of money that it costs! It's only a few minutes across the river to the souk, but it's a lovely way to see a little bit more of the old Dubai that so often gets swallowed up in the modern glitz and glamour.I'd definitely recommend,"

The wooden ferry has no railings so be aware when going with kids - I had a 1.5yr old kid and while it was scary she had a great time. The price for the 10min ferry rid is just 1dhm!

Don't expect any health and safety regulations - you jump on and off (over the gap if there is one) and sit on the communal seat down the middle of the boat. There aren't any rails so this might not be a good option if you have small, active children or have certain disabilities. There is a canvas roof so you can hide from the sun. Definitely the best way to cross the creek with great views and photo opportunities. When you arrive at the dock, drivers will ask you if you want to go across or round, round being a 45 minute cruise along the creek. We also did this and had the boat to ourselves. Forget expensive cruises - this is the way to see the creek! The dock itself is also really atmospheric, allowing you to capture the flavour of the other side of Dubai."

Fishing boats also dock here .Fancy boats,water buses are hired by tourists from here to cruise in the creek.It is a very exciting and pleasant experience. People cross the creek from BurDubai to Gold /Spice souls or for other activities through Abra dock ferry service.Only one Aed oneway fare to cross the Creek and it is really a very cheap & pleasant joy ride. Evening time it is terrific to see the Well-lit buildings, monuments, on both banks of the creek reflecting in the water.Lighted Fancy boats plying in the creek can be seen from this dock.Tourists must visit this place to get a feel of old Dubai."

But in evening it is worth looking at mix of historical dubai with ultramodern buoldings on banks of the creek... Beutiful lights on boats and at times breez will cheer you while sailing... We travelled with baby stroller and could accomodate in abra after collepsing it fully (surprisingly, RTA, who governs abra, did not know if strollers are accomdated or not... So we took chance of carrying along as we did nit want our little one to walk across crowded streets of Dubai old soukOverall it was fascinating experience for kids and for rest of family it was experienceing traditional way of commuting... Only difficulty we had is lots of diesy smell in air as most abra boats use disel engine I suppose.Next time you go to Dubai, this is highly recommended for a change from AC METRO, BUSES AND CABS \u263a"

The abra was really more of a motor boat with a wooden bench on it. For some reason the boater piloted from the middle of the craft (with passengers sitting in his line of sight) from a slightly submerged position (making you wonder whether he could see).If that doesn't deter you, then the abra ride does offer a good view of both sides of the creek. There were also a few tourists (not many, though that may also be because of decreased activity on a Friday, during Ramadan), but generally it was not too crowded or too long to wait for an abra to depart."

Many local shops here as well with interesting articles for sale. Well worth a visit to historic Dubai. Usually very busy on Fridays. If you found this review of interest please indicate below."

First of all, it was really windy and sand storm day when we went with the kids via train from Dubai Marina Towers (wasnt a good idea at all and no boat could go to Old dubai due to storm).Then hardy found any taxi at the train station due to storm and the station not being very busy (last station of this side of dubai). Took an Abra )old style boat ) for few dinars per person which took was a good BUT short ride and nothing excited to see around. Jus feels like you are in an OLD market where cleaning,luxury life or malls are not on government's list.Walked through Dubai Market which was just fine but nothing much to see or shop. Then we all ended up taking taxi back to marina malls after getting bored and roated enough in OLD dubai. Must visit for experience but dont waste much of your time on visit to Old dubai if you are short on your holidays"

The Dubai of today may be about the gleaming new towers and resorts but the Creek is where this small village earned its keep to grow into the bustling metropolis of today. The Abra provides a cheap quick water taxi between Bur Dubai and Deira. I highly recommend this to travelers who want to see and feel how the real Dubai local travels."

On the other side you can visit local supermarkets and shops or sit in the park (on the grass as there's no seats).

By the docks you can take an aura, a boat for up to 20 people that for only 1 Dirham takes you over to the other side. The trip takes max 10 minutes. On the other side i the gold souk and the spice souk. Not for me but still fun. Go back on the abra and then you can enjoy dinner at the water restaurants.

On both routes the fare is AED 1 and these are for public transportation. You can also hire the Abras for Private Trips ar AED 100 per hour. Best time for this trip is late evenings in summer March to October and any time during day November to February.Useful Tips: If you are lone male the public Abra trip is fine as you can jostle with other pax who are generally workmen.If you are a couple or family a private trip is ideal and you can enjoy sights, smell and sounds of the creek.If the wind and tide are high, these choppy water can toss the Abra when boarding and de-boarding. So be careful with your step.People allergic to diesel smoke should avoid the Abra Ride as it can make you throw up."

Perfect day is to take the metro to Al Ghubaiba station, go to the Dubai Museum, they explore the textile souk. After you are finish go to the Abra dock and for 1dhs per person you get to go for a 10 minute ride across the creek to the Deira side. On the Deira side you can check on the spice souk and the gold souk. For dinner you can go on a dinner boat cruise for around 65-75 dhs at night. Tons of dinner boats are lined up along the creek you can just walk up to and make a reservation and buy a ticket."

Our Big Bus ticket came with a free Dhow \"ride\", essentially a water taxi that would take us from one side of the creek (khor) to the other at the cost of AED1 (one Dirham). When we arrived at the creek - there were more options. We opted for a 45 minute sail along the creek at a cost of AED 60 per person. It was idyllic. We sailed along with a soft breeze and occasional sea spray in our faces. Beautiful views, sunny blue sky, calm and serene environment. The only sounds were the Dhow motor and some seagulls above. Bliss!"

You are well advised to keep your balance as you board these craft and then sit down all around the raised platform on the boat amongst the locals, who in my experience seem to be mainly of Indian sub continental descent. I paid 1 AED for the crossing. I sat near the \"driver\" who stood in a well in the centre of the boat and who controlled the engine with his bare feet. I wondered how much he could really see to navigate through all the similar boats criss crossing the river from all directions. But we made it.On getting off I narrowly avoided making a real fool of myself and falling into the water. These craft are pretty unstable so ride them at your own risk. This form of transport is a lifetime away from the ultra modern Metro, Tram and morotways of Dubai. And I'm grateful for that."

On the Deira side there is the Spice Souk and the Old Gold Souk.As for the Abras they are great fun and well managed.If you are feeling more adventurous, for AED120 (about 120GBP) you can hire an Abra for an hour for a group of up to 20 people (the cost is for the boat not per head) to travel all the way up the creek past the Sheikh's palace and to where the many trading dhows from India, Pakistan and Iran are berthed and offloaded."

Take the trip and enjoy the dhows on the other side of the creek (Diera side) a good budget afternoon, no need for a tour just take a taxi to the Abra station around 3 pm and the Diera side will start coming to life around 4 pm. Please bear in mind that most of the Diera side closes for the afternoon so from 1 pm onwards it's best to wait until 3 or 4 pm. Once over the other side of the creek I'd highly recommend a dhow trip from one of the operators. "

This dock is very busy, with big tourist groups constantly lining up to catch an aura to the Deira side of the creek (where you will find the Old Souk, the Gold Souk, the Fish Market, and much more!). It costs only 1 AED per person for the ride, which lasts about 5-10 minutes, and they quickly move all the people waiting, with abras (small boats) constantly docking to take people. Overall, it is well organised. You get on the boat, and pay either the driver or an aid. Men and women sit together (there aren't any 'women only' abras or anything). One thing: OH&S is not a priority here - you step on to the boat from the dock, and the boat itself has no barriers or anything. So if your balance isn't great, be sure to hold on to someone or something when getting on and getting off - and keep tight hold of your goodies, lest you accidentally knock them into the water! People's sunglasses and hats frequently fall into the drip. You will pass boats overloaded with goods, preparing to go to Iran, India, and other places. It is a fascinating look into a somewhat hidden element of Dubai trade. Highly recommend!"

So early in the morning around 8.30 am we arrived at Abra station and started to look one to hire for cruise. We noticed that all price to use Abra as public transportation or for private use were already regulated by government. If you use it as transportation together with others you'll pay 1 AED, but if you'd like to have the boat yourself for 1/2 hour cruise is 60 AED and 1 hour 120 AED. We took 1/2 hour cruise since it was hot (38 C) as it was on summer. The ride was worth though as we could see the other side of Dubai, not just desert and wide dusty road but also huge river, housing complex, boats from Iran and other part of Arab region. We also crossed by one of the palace owned by the King. It was fun and I guess it was also a good closure of our holiday at Dubai."

Most of those using the service seem to be \"locals\" and tourists will run the gauntlet of being approached for private tours - just ignore them and get on the abra currently being loaded up, unless you really want to do an extended tour up the Creek.

If you park in front of HSBC, then on the way to the abra station, don't forget to stop at the small shawarma join on your right side, the spicy one is quite nice. Then you can wait for the abra at the station until the gentlemen by the gate ask you to board the abra (he will count the number of people to make sure there's enough room for people to sit). Once you're on board, just enjoy and don't forget to take a snap on the scenic and maybe a selfie. The cost for the trip is only 1 dirham, which is quite cheap for the experience.

Its something very touristic but very enjoyable and, at the same time, its the fastest way to go from the Deira Souq to the Bur Dubai Gold Souq. There will be people offering private rides for more expensive rates but that depends in your wallet and desiree to do it. For me, when I used to have visitors, I would always take them here and everyone enjoy it....A must in my opinion..."

We went back and forth many times, on both routes.BTW, just show up with coins in your pocket, they load you and the abra goes as soon as it is full, which usually takes less than two minutes. No planning required.The abras are a remnant of old Dubai, and the most interesting thing in Dubai (except perhaps the culture clash between traditional muslim / Arab / nomadic and western values, between excessive wealth and immigrant guest workers) ... but I digress. This is my number one attraction in Dubai - followed closely by the fish market (and not by the gold souk), the Burj Khalifa and the indoor ski area (Ski Dubai)."

It was about 18 pence each to cross the creek and it was wonderful to see all the boats and abra boat taxis. This area is very different to the new larger than life buildings and malls of the modern Dubai. The creek is wide and it would have been great to have had a creek boat ride, but it was a little difficult finding out exactly where to go. Hopefully on our next visit."

So a great place to sit down, do nothing, except perhaps a couple of Abra rides up and down the creek, sip some jasmine tea, listen to the periodic 'azaan' from the nearby mosques and (as the sun goes down) soak in the lights of old Dubai as they simmer in the creek waters. Enchanting!!!!"

I went with my colleagues on our free and easy day during our company trip and we took the abra from the other side, Deira Old Souq station to Bur Dubai station for AED1 only (one way). The ride was short but breezy. The abra excreets a strong petrol smell when departing from the docks so best to sit further away from the engine. You pay for your abra ride to the ticket collecter on the abra itself. He will be sitting/standing in the middle of the abra. There are 4 stations altogether where each station leads you to different part of the Dubai Creek such as the Gold Souk, Spice Souk and Textile Souk - which is Meena Bazaar. Do drop by Meena bazaar for some good pashimina shawls (100% cashmere) for as low as AED10 each. Really good place for all knick knacks and anything local including souvenirs."

The Bur Dubai station is right outside the Little India and there are two Hindu temples and stores selling prayer items, well worth the walk along that area. The Deira end meanwhile is within reach of the Gold and Spice souks which is well worth the walk to experience the typical Arabic market.

At first it can look like pure chaos on the water with abras ready to smash one another any moment, but this is a well tuned dance with these drivers. They know what they are doing and drive these 'water taxis\" just like any other driving in the UAE: chaotic and nerve wracking at times.Docking will either be a smooth entry or a wild moment of bumper cars between the abra and the dock. I am still not sure which one I prefer. And getting off or on the dock or abra can be an adventure. They roll that agra up to the dock and sometimes you gently step off and other times you hurl yourself in the direction you want to go while the abra and dock are bobbing far away from each other.For one dirham- it is well worth the ride."

Nothing particularly exciting but you can have a nice little boat ride around the creek on a wooden boat, for a very low price. The souk area behind the docks is full of guys trying to sell fake rubbish scarves etc to tourists. Avoid that if you can. It might feel like a middle east experience but in reality, its lot of poorly paid asian guys selling fake junk. Don't get drawn in unless you are looking for a fake watch ofcourse. If you want some authentic arabian clothing, there are plenty of other shops where locals actually get their items from."

The Abra's are really easy to use, look for the next vessel boarding, walk onto the boat, take a seat and pay for the crossing, which takes about 10 minutes. If you're heading to the gold/spice souk cross over the road the spice souk is on the right, for the gold souk, first junction turn right. There are a number of stations along the creek, I only explored a little. By the time I had finished exploring the 2 souks the traffic in the area was really bad, and there were no taxis, so I took an Abra across the creek and found a taxi a lot easier on the other side of the old souk.

You could come to Dubai in a A380, drive a chauffeur driven car, stay at the Armani or Burj Al Arab,take the metro but your trip is not complete without the short trip on the abra. Abra are small open boats which ply between Deira Dubai and Bur Dubai. It cost just AED1 for a trip. Each Trip will carry 20 passengers sitting on both side of the boat. It is the most enjoyable short boat trip with the boat rocking and wind and water spraying on your face. . It is fun, cheap and the fastest, easiest and cheapest way to cross the creak. Both sides are the busiest area and going by car will take you a minimum 2 hours during peak time. Try it and you will enjoy it. The landing side of bur dubai is where you get curious and you are now in the famous textile market of Dubai"

A much over used term but I think a a quick trip (and back) along Dubai Creek in a water taxi across to the other side is a 'must do'For a just 1 dirham, spend a few minutes in the cool breeze watching other vessels coming to and fro. I think it was just 40 AED to hire one of your own to take you up and down the creek!Check out the tons of goods, fridges/freezers/TVs being loaded, stored & packed precariously on colourful large wooded boats about to make there way across the ocean to trade in India, Pakistan & elsewhere.A great way to relax for a while & just observe."

You hop on the boat and find a spot to sit (all passengers face the water on either side) and pay the driver or attendant when they come around. The motorized boats move quite quickly to take you to the other side or along the river to another station where you hop off when the boat pulls up to the dock.

The boats are one of the main transportation over the creek from Deira to Bur Dubai so the boats are filled with tourists and people getting to their jobs or just transporting small things between the 2 places of Dubai.Pros:- Nice experiance.- A must thing to do while in Dubai.- Quick transportation.- Low cost.Cons:- Most of the boats does not have a exhaust pipe so out of the middle of the boat where the boat captain sits there is loads of fumes coming up. A tip is to sit at the front in order to get as little fumes as possible.- Considering the fumes one may wonder what kind of health policy the company have towards their personnel. Or rather, if they care about the health of their personnel at all.- Safety #1, there is no safety rales at all on the boat. A less then 1\" high board on the edge of the boat is all you have to support yourself onto.- Safety #2, considering #1. It is very common for the boats to bump into eachother.- The entrance/exit areas are dirty and not well kept. - For someone living in Dubai it is easy to know which boat to take if you know the different names where the boat is going but for a tourist it is difficult to know which boat to take to end you up at X position on the other side of the creek. A hint for the company would be to put up some better information about it."

The small motor boats run almost every couple of minutes ferrying both passengers and tourists alike. Very good... preserves the cultural heritage of the country."

In fact, we liked it so much that we have taken it 3 times to cross the creek. It felt as if we were travelling back in times when goods and spices had to be transported by boats. It's so unique. The station is about 5 minutes walk from the metro where wooden boats with motor are moored and passengers walk on to sit on long benches. One of the three ways to get across the creek from Bur Dubai to the souks. On either side, there's lots to do. We have done it in the morning and twice at sunset. It's truly magical!"

If you are traveling with young kids (or others who need assistance) make sure you help them on and off the boat (or at least keep a close eye on them) as you may have a big step to get to the dock depending on how close the boat pulls in.

I was really surprised to know that there are still wooden ships that go to the open seas. i thought that was a lost era because we already have big modern cargo ships. but wow, it was so good and their numbers, it was not just 10 or 15 ships but hundreds of them. we stepped down at the souk station and walk from there which we overly enjoyed exploring."

We visited the Gold Souk in the morning and had planned to visit the museum across the creek in the afternoon and I had read about the 1 AED fare to use the water taxi. There was no clear signage on our side of the dock and the entrance wasn't immediately obvious so we pottered up and down the waterfront for a time past the more industrial parts of the creek. Once we found the station we were shown a sign written in Arabic that depicted 1 AED and 120 AED, we could see a boat that was nearly full on the side so agreed. Once we were down on the riverside we were ushered onto an empty boat - I initially thought it was because the other boat was full but alas no! We had unwittingly agreed to go on an hours private tour for \u00a320 ish. Whilst this was not what we initially wanted we decided to go with the flow and enjoy the scenery and it was very relaxing. The price wasn't too bad for an hour of the drivers time - although he spent all of it on his phone and steering the vessel with his foot. As a relatively experienced traveller I should of known better but we enjoyed ourselves so what the heck!"

Taking a ride on an abra is an experience in itself, and its practically free in 1 dirham :). we had our two children , a child buggy , sum shopping bags , yet managed to hop on an abra which took us to the deira side of dubai. there were sea gulls flying around, people on different types of boats waving , there was even a water bus transporting its passengers, a dhow, it was an adventurous experience which cannot be simply described in words. it was like one is living the life of a local by taking a ride on the abra. we enjoyed it thoroughly (even my kids)"

USD 0.30) you can get on this simple wooden watercraft from the abra dock and pick a space to sit on (the benches are lined in the middle parallel along the boat). Boat is motorized by the diesel, so get used to the fume and noise from it. There are designated boat docks along both sides of the Creek. The popular docks are the Dubai Old Souq marine station(by the textile souq) and the Deira Old Souq marine station(by the spice souq). Crossing the Creek on abra can be little frightened since there is no handrail to hold on to. In general still pretty safe to ride on. You pay after you board. Sometime you might come close to the Dhow dinner cruises sailing by. The night crossing on the abra is fun to do you can enjoy the cool breeze, colorful hanging lights decorated dhows, the glowing neon lights from the buildings along the Creek, and the light reflections on the water waves."

Accordingly, fewer people spend their money in the Bur Dubai markets than in the Gold Souk market area.Please note that Dubai has become a cruise ship destination in recent years. During the 10 days we were in Dubai we saw the Gold and Spice Souks overrun with large groups of primarily German and Chinese tourists who were dutifully following their cruise guides to the places that give kickbacks to the cruise lines. There was noticeably less negotiating for jewelry in the Gold Souk versus the less-traveled Bur Dubai area.The great news, and the undoubted Bargain of Dubai, is that there are a couple of places on each side of the Creek where visitors can catch an \"abra\" (a diesel-powered wooden water taxi) and get transported across the Creek for one Dirham per person. So for the equivalent of 27 US cents per person, people can jump on an abra and take a 15-minute voyage across the Creek either to-or-from the Bur Dubai marketplace. The view of Dubai and the dhow docks along the Creek from the abra is absolutely magical."

This is by far the only cheapest ride in the whole of Dubai and deserves to be on the top of all attractions. Costs only 1 AED to cross the creek from Bur Dubai to Deira (Gold & Spice Souk). One must visit & experience the ride to feel the old school modes of transportation."

The dock on the Bur Dubai side is right in front of the Textile Souk, so you could explore that area first before taking the abra to Deira to see the Spice and Gold Souks.The abra ride across the creek is less than five minutes but it's breezy and fun as you watch all the boats go by and take in the scenery. My family had so much fun doing it and if you are with your kids, they will really love it. To get to the dock, take the Green Line Metro to the Al Ghubailba Station.

My suggestion is to charter an abra for about 120dhs per hour... Each abra could fit 12-20people...if you want to share the experience. Your trip takes you from the heritage diving village to the floating bridge... Through the old souq and the Dubai Parliament House.

The Dubai Museum and the wholesale Textile market are on the Bur Dubai side, whereas the Gold Souk & Spice Market are on the Deira side of the creek. Regular taxis are hard to get in both these areas so the best way to cross over is an Abra.The Abra station is manned with polite staff and dont worry if you dont have time to buy a ticket as they will take cash on the boat as you cross over. There is a govt. run service but I much prefer the smaller, traditional boats that are run by licensed private operators."

We went to Bur Dubai to see what Old Dubai looked like all over, and as part of the tour we took the Tax across the creek (which is more like a huge lake to me!) to the Textile Souk. We walked down the port to another taxi stop to come back. What we found so interesting is how safe it was there. The big wooden boats were docked at the port with their wares sitting on the dock waiting to be picked up the next day. No one takes anything! It sits there until the next day when the buyer comes to pick it up. It was really amazing!"

Beware there are some people trying to sell in an aggressive way\u2026 apart from that, it\u2019d be a nice experience to enjoy the breeze of river and shopping for souvenir."

            "review": "Get down and local on the Creek. Too many visitors to Dubai are blinded by the bling and don't make it down to the Creek either on the Bur Dubai (oldest part of Dubai) or Deira sides. Connecting the two sides at the lower end of the Creek are the small, long boat abras which have been plying their routes for decades and are the cheapest and most used form of transport for workers commuting across this part of the city. For 1 AED (about 30 US cents) you can take a five minute ride across one way. There are two stations on either side of the Creek several hundred metres apart. If you take the lower staton (behind Bank of Baroda near Carrefour Bur Dubai), your abra will pull in at the lower station on Deira side which is the spice souk area. If you go to the top station on Bur Dubai side, near the mosque and fabric souk, your abra will land near the gold souk (Al Sabka) station. It doesn't really matter which one you find as they are just walking distance apart. It might look a bit precarious to the first time user but it is a really efficient and safe process of fast docking and smooth riding despite about 20 people all sitting facing the water on either side of the driver who stands in a pit in the middle of the boat. There are also life jackets for those who are anxious passengers. You see whole families with even prams and shopping on board and it all seems to work well. Money is collected on board by the driver just as the boat is filled up and coin is appreciated though they can usually manage some change of small notes. There are drivers who will approach tourists and offer you an abra ride (personalised) for 100 AED which is a complete rip off as they do not usually have the language skills for any commentary and you could take 100 of the standard rides for the pleasure. There are also 'imitation' abra rides to be had at Madinat in Jumeirah but these are around the canal area there rather than a working port space and 60 AED is charged. Well out of reach of the standard Dubai worker who might receive that in a couple of days of wages. Try a Shawarma (doner/souvlaki) at one of the cafeterias around the Deira souk areas. They are usually 5 AED or less and are a great and safe snack to eat while on the move. This is something I do regularly and makes me feel I am really seeing Dubai."

The journey costed us 1dirham each way (about 17p) every time. Just make sure you know the name of the dock on the opposite side that you want to get to, and there are always people around that can point you in the right direction. The taxis are constantly coming and going, so we never waited longer than 2 minutes for an abra. It took around 10 minutes to cross the creek."

For just AED 1 (GBP 20p) you get to ride across the Creek ( I guess you'll go first in the dircetion from the Gold Souk to Bur Dubai and the Textile Souk mostly, as a tourist) and you get close-up views of the wooden dhows that still ply the Arabian Gulf and the Indian Ocean with great photo-opportuniuties to snap these old wooden vessels with 'Manhattan' as the backdrop. The Textile Souk is well worth sauntering through - it's (first) half tourist show and half (second, more distant) a working souk, little changed over a long period of time, much more than the 40 years since Dubai got developed rapidly. The restaurant hanging over the water a few yards up the Creek from the abra station is fantastic food at great value but crowded in the season and the nearby Fort, now a museum, is a must. You can hire an abra for AED10 an hour and take a personalised trip around the Creek - great value for money."

Dubai creek is dividing the city of Dubai in to two parts : Daira and Bur Dubai and years ago using the small boats was the only way to go between the two parts, it's not a long trip, its takes only 10 minutes to cross it , some Asian workers still used it as its very cheap way to get in to the other part of Dubai( 1 Dirham - less than $1 ) per person if you are going with the other passengers crossing the creek , however if you are looking for a private and longer trip ( which I recommend ) you should take a private boat takes you in trip for ( 1hour or half an hour around the creek), you have to pay ( 100 Dhs - $ 27) for the one hour and ( 60 Dhs-$16) for 1/2 hour , and this amount of money is per boat not per passenger Crossing the creak at night by using (al Abra = small boat ), it's a wonderful experience The small boats, the smell of the creek, and the soft lights around you give you an amazing feeling. The best way to get there is by visiting the heritage village anther magical place where the small caf\u00e9s all around the (khor = creek), best time after the sunset and preferably in winter or spring"
