I am puting away one star for the room master - she was angry that we came 2 minutes in advance and that we went directly downstairs. She repeated it 3 times. Also, she seemed bored and not caring about our fun."

My kids (11, 13) were bored stiff and frustrated with sightseeing, so I scrounged through the internet looking for things that would make Prague memorable for them too and discovered escape games. While granny explored the castle to her heart's content, we were just down the road locked in the \"Old World\"! We highly recommend this game to families like us who need a break from the crowds and something fun to do together. It wasn't too hard for the kids, because it doesn't depend on a lot of specialised knowledge. Their intuition and curiosity were a bonus and we made a great team of 3. I was astounded how we figured things out. We juuuust finished the tasks. Well, a few well-timed clues and a couple of extra minutes at the end gave us that sense of accomplishment as the door clicked open. I think we may be hooked!"

The setting is great, the puzzles are original. You get hints when the game master decides to give you a hint, we are glad they do not give them too fast so you really have the chance to discover everything by yourself first. The staff was very friendly and they take the time after the game to talk through the game and let you take pictures if you want to. The game is described as 'very hard', but every group should be able to manage to escape with some hints. It was a great experience, so do not hesitate to book this room!"

I heard a lot about The Room and when my step sister visited me in Prague and asked if we could do it, I decided to go for it :)We were 2 adults + 1 teen (16 years old) + 1 kid (11 years) and we decided for the Occultica.It is very large, very well designed, very challenging and a lot of fun!!!Unfortunately an electrical system did not work, so the helper there tried to fix it for a very long time, while we kept looking for other clues.Otherwise VERY VERY VERY gooooooooood game for family and friends!The staff is also very helpful and friendly!I can just recommend it! :)"

I booked this not really knowing how it would go down with our group (none of us have done an escape room before). I think all would agree it was probably one of the best things we could have done. It was fun, challenging, well put together, the guide was very friendly and we all came away grinning from ear to ear having completed 'The Room Occultica' with only 15 seconds to spare. I can't imagine how anyone that hasn't done one of these before could rate any less than 5 stars, for us it was worth every penny and almost every second!"

It was money well spent, the time ticks a lot quicker than you would expect, there seemed to be enough challenges to keep everyone in the group occupied. We got close to finishing but just missed the time window, we did also need to ask for a couple of hints. You really do need to stop and think... maths plays a part too.The staff were brilliant, I booked the original slot for the wrong time so we missed it. Mirek very kindly rescheduled without hesitation.I would definitely recommend this for anyone fancying an alternative to the normal activities in Prague."

We did need some hints but it didn't take away the fun we had.We were 6 and that is probaly the perfect number of player for this one.The only thing that could be improved is that usually, escape rooms have a introduction story. a Backgroup story on the room of what happened, or a story plot to follow.

We played the older room where you have to acquire 10 locks to escape the room. Our boys are ages 10 and 12 and found this one a little be harder than our other experience. That being said, both of our boys were able to solve some of the riddles and help us escape. The host was very friendly and engaging. She promptly provided hints when we needed them. The hints were also good...they were enough to help you get unstuck, but they didn't give away the entire solution. All in all we had a another great experience playing this game. I think the game room is also in a great location. It's located in the \"lesser town\" on the Prague Castle side of the river. The streets are a prettier walk. We visited the KGB museum afterward and had a great time. The tower on the hill and castle are also other sights you could include along with this room. Again, we had a great experience....I would recommend!!"

The tasks were intelectually demanding, but fun at the same time, and it was interesting to see how our mind sets worked when we were required to work together as a team. It was evident that the organisers spent some decent time on putting the tasks together and although it was quite hard to figure out certain tasks, it was very rewarding when we did. Don't be afraid to ask the administrator for a bit of help; we didn't or not as much as we should have; and that sadly resulted in failure and not completing the whole mission.

First we did the smaller room, which was fun and had really cool but simple challenges. Unfortunately, they had a technical difficulty with a part of the game which inhibited us from getting out on time. This was made up with the staff being super nice, not only regarding the game but also about our visit in Prague giving advice on places to got etc and most importantly to a 20% discount on their second room - which we ended up doing the same day.Occultica Room: Their biggest escape room was possibly the coolest room I've seen so far with complex, difficult but rewarding task and a lot of space. Our group had excellent time here and everything worked like dance. We had our hearts racing from excitement when we solved the locks and the feeling after solving the room was just awesome - this particular room made me a permanent fan of the escape games!!!In general their establishments were well designed and located in the centre of Prague, easy to find. The staff was not fun, friendly and professional. Great experience altogether and can recommend this to all groups interested in Room Escapes!"

We all jumped in rushing from one puzzle to the next shouting encouragement and clues to each other on the way.

The Enigma-room is supposedly a little harder, but we boys found it to be easier to crack than the first room we tried. Perhaps because we had gotten warmed up by then. The staff is really friendly and forthcoming, and they'll help you decide which room to pick if you ask them.It all really comes down to your thematic preferences; would you rather try to escape a room set in a medieval fantasy world, or a World War 2 PoW scenario? Either way, you won't be disappointed, and you might end up booking another room like we did.Apparently, they're also in the process of making one or more new thematic rooms.

We actually found it fairly difficult, and needed more hints than we were expecting - I think it's because we were over thinking all the clues, when really they're fairly explicit. I would recommend doing this in a group bigger than 2 - to ensure you get through in time. This has inspired us to want to try more escape games - so thanks for that!"

But this I assume is very very rare and should not impact the rating of what is truly a very very fun thing to do.I will spoil any of the secrets in the secret chamber but just tell you that you get a good instruction (short but precise) and then you are let in the room. There are cameras hidden and if you get stuck you will get a hint via the walkie talkie you get equipped with.I went with my daughter and that was really fun to see how we could supplement each other in the solving of the many puzzles.Time: 59:41 - so we did it (barely)I recommend this highly - and had I had the time I would have done the Enigma game also"

We done the Alchemists chamber and it was set up like something from 1600s. Was fortunate we had a good mixed group of 4 with different approaches so we managed it in 47minutes. It helps to have a few problem solvers on your team as well as lateral thinkers. (Although you get audio prompts if you get really stuck. As the staff watch you on camera) personally I managed to unlock a few of the padlocked cases and find a few items. However as a result of a wild night I was feeling unwell so couldn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked. You need to go in feeling fresh and prepared for a challenge. I can't wait to do my next escape game. Thanks!"

All resembling the setting of world war II. We played the escaping game with our 8 month old baby... It wasnt ideal to have her around cause she wanted some attention so some precious time was lost, but it was not a big issue. Overall what i am trying to say is that it was great fun. So if you are in prague do not let anything stop you from enjoying an escaping game. Not even little kids!"

There were seven of us so we booked both Alchemist's Chambers for the same hour and split into teams. That's a great opportunity for large groups, you can even compete. Most of us weren't first time players so we were fast, smart and creative =) Despite this we barely made it in an hour -- the level of puzzles makes your brain sweat. And we really love it. The scene is quite authentic. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hints you get from them are always allegorical which makes it more interesting.

Furthermore a few things that were not supposed to move or fall did exactly that without us barely touching them and after the game we felt kind of blamed for it which was not very nice and embarrassing.So we really enjoyed the game but there was room for improvements in the game and the treatment to the players."

The puzzles were really clever and not just working out codes for padlocks - there were magnetically sealed boxes, decoding puzzles and even one involving morse code and an actual telegraph machine. Really, really enjoyed it. Friendly staff and well thought out, even the methods of communicating with your 'handler' felt quite natural and in-keeping with the theme (in enigma).

This was our first escape room (2 couples) and it got us hooked!We did The Alchemist room and it was brilliant, the riddles were well thought and well made.There isn't much to say other than it's fun, doesn't take too long (~ hour) and was a short subway ride away from our hotel. A small tip for first timers, don't get discouraged if you feel stuck!"

I would definitely recommend spending an hour of your holiday playing this game (nice break from sightseeing!). Enjoy!"

The room itself was so interesting and the atmosphere was good. The tasks we had to do was challenging, but with a little thinking you can solve them! Our guide gave us extra time to get out of the room and we were really happy and thankful about that.

We chose the Alchemist and thoroughly enjoyed it, we enjoyed it so much that we booked to do the Enigma the following day, this was equally as good and we are so glad we found these games..It really grips you and I can guarantee that if you do this you will be talking about it for days after..Each game cost 1200 czk which is about \u00a334 but well worth it.What was also refreshed no was they didn't try to sell you any photos or merchandise afterwards.Highly recommended."

They do not nickel and dime you, instead there are little details they include to make your experience that much better. When we were done they had water for us, they provide free lockers to put you things in while you are in the room, they even took pictures for us and emailed them to us free of charge and presented us with a souvenir magnet for free! It was so refreshing to not be hassled to purchase additional things at the end, or have any hidden charges. The staff, wow if every attraction had staff like this they would be really lucky. Their English is perfect and they are super nice. It was just a great experience all around.

We had booked the alchemists chamber.When we first entered the room we had a mad dash round lookin for as much as we could. After 15 minutes we thought we had solved quite alot and we would be out soon-but we were wrong after our quick start our pace slowed and we got stuck with solving the final solution. We managed to complete the room with a few helpful hints. The magnet you receive at the end with your escape time is a great momento along with the picture opportunities.We felt the price was reasonable as we would expect to pay higher back home in Scotland.Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something new to try.

It is easy to reach, and the staff is friendly and helpful. We arived early and they had no issues with letting us start before our set time as it was empty beforehand. The room itself is very well desgined, and the atmosphere is clearly felt within. The Puzzles weren't terribly hard, but they were all interactive and had a clear, understandable flow and purpose. We never felt lost or dumbfounded, and yet the riddles did require thought and attention. We should say that we have some experience with escape rooms, and for newer players the room is definitely challenging, in a good way. Worth your time/money."

George, our helper who was watching us from another room, let us get on with it and only gave us small hints when we started getting stuck. Although we didn't get to escape in the allocated time he spent another 10mins at the end guiding us through the final stages which was really nice because the experience we gained by completing the game will definitely help us in the next one we try. As beginners we loved it but I imagine it's challenging for even the experienced gamers."

It comes in handy you don't need to speak english to be fully part of this attraction.We initially booked the Alchemist's chamber, which was real fun and challenging to do! We can not tell more since this would spoil the experience from next users but we can tell you that as soon we came out we also booked the Enigma room.To me Enigma was a little bit more challenging and a little less child friendly than the Alchemist's chamber. Although the kids liked both experiences.It's a pity they didn't have a third room or we would have booked it to!The staff is very friendly, comes in with a hint when needed (needed one in the Enigma room - which we made in 43 minutes with one hint) and is fluent in English.Rooms are easily reachable, five minutes walking from the metro station."

The place is run very professionally -they give you a fun backstory to the room, lend you a walky talky in case you need help/want to ask them questions, have great background music, effects, and design. The room wasn't creepy at all (you can just open the main door to get out if you need to), but it did feel realistic! You can specify how much help you want (they watch you on a hidden camera and give you advice when you're stuck). I highly recommend it.

My sister found this online and sent it to me while I was in Prague (which i still am until Saturday) , so we thought we would check it out as its something different from checking out the city, which by the way is beautiful. So upon arrival you are briefed with a little back story .story depends on what room you go into. There is The Alchemist, Enigma and two others I can't remember. We did The Alchemist. Once briefed , there are free lockers to put your bags in. You are then given some paper a pencil and a radio which you can use to ask for hints if you get majorly stuck. We used ours 3 times. You are then put in the room and the door is closed, and away you go. I won't tell you what to do in the room as that will give it away but I can tell you its awesome. It gets you thinking. If your from the UK and are reading this its a cross between Fun House and the Crystal Maze. You get an hour to complete it and there are different sounds to notify you when 15, 30, 45 and 1 hour has passed . We completed ours in 56mins. Definitely worth a visit and would definitely back and do all rooms.Rooms cost 1200 Kc per room regardless of how many people.You MUST book in advance as its always busy. Telephone +420 775 082 395I've added a couple Pictures."

We chose the easier one, the Alchemist's chamber, as it was our first time playing a room escape. After a brief explanationof the objective we were sealed in the room and given 60 minutes to find the philosopher's stone and unlock the door to our freedom. Without giving the fun away, it's a really inventive puzzle and everything inside the room stays with the theme.

Beware it looks like an apartment building and there was no signage so we thought we were in the wrong place, but we were right. Once you walk down the stairs they tell you what to expect in the rooms and what you will need to do. It's a human puzzle, so work together and try everything. It's only lasts 1 hour and it was $1200CZK for a couple. Seemed a little pricey, but we loved it. And we beat the game at 55minutes, just in time."

We arrived and received a brief orientation of what to expect and were then locked in the room and left to solve the puzzles and clues. The game requires good communication and team work so it's a great activity for a date night or small group of friends. We're both competitive people, who are good at puzzles, so we were surprised about how challenging the scenario was (which made it especially fun). We received the perfect amount of help when we got stuck and definitely recommend this activity. It is well worth the money and time!"

I felt the room was laid out very well, the decorations were nice and there were some pretty cool electronics in the puzzles. The room was well researched as well, I visited the alchemy cave the day after and the history of Prague was well represented in the room. I thought it was very nicely thought out.Rebecca was lovely, a bit shy but explained the rules very clearly.

It is only a 5 minute walk from the IP Pavlova Metro station.It really us a must do if you are visiting Prague."

Great value, great host, simple concept but executed very well with authentic sounds and props.

On arriving we were met by one of the girls who spoke perfect English, she was very friendly and funny. They explained very clearly what we had to do, although that went out the window once we went in to the game. The game lasts about an hour and is a crystal maze type of puzzle game. Once you solve one puzzle you move onto the next one until you free yourself from the room. it caused rows, and joy est laughter and at the end both my wife and I thought it was one of the best things we've ever done.I can't recommend it enough, if you do nothing else in Prague make sure you escape for an hour and you'll be absolutely entrained."

It's a well constructed room of mind puzzles that require no prelearned skills or language ability, so any nationality can try. There were some groups of 6 people, but we were only 2 and it was fine. We needed a few hints, but if you enjoy feeling paralysed with your own lack of understanding, this is for you. Staff are super, and although we hadn't booked, they super-speedily made up the room for us and let us do it anyway. Really great; about \u00a330 for an hour."

The place is very small so you can hear people in other rooms and a lot speak in English so you can hear spoilers. and when we arrived a group was discussing their game and were trying to ruin our game by giving clues and hints - the staff did nothing to shut them.The first room (not the alchemist one) began fun but you can see they don't care about the either room - it was falling apart. my shirt got ripped there because there was something sticking out that was not supposed to be sticking out and some parts of the puzzle were broken and the staff had to enter and help us which ruined the mood.The second room was very nicely decorated but again it was old and not cared for, One of the puzzles solved itself just by being broken,I would not waste my time on this room. Prague has a lot more to offer and other rooms to visit. Just search for them."

This was our first escape room experience and we loved it so will definitely be looking for more now. The theme for the alchemist's room and trying to find the philosopher's stone was also perfect for the setting in Prague thanks to the city's history with alchemy, and this really added to the thrill and enjoyment of the experience as well. We completed the room with a family of 5 and it was fun because the group was able to split up and sort of each focus on solving different parts of the puzzles and then come together with our findings. I imagine that the game would be quite different with only 2 people though as there were a few puzzles I didn't really get to play with since they were completed by someone else, so with a smaller group you'd actually get to do everything yourself if that sort of thing is important to you. Highly recommended and definitely a highlight of our trip."

This hour was a welcome respit to all of the walking and crowds and challenging and fun!!! The idea is to be locked in a room for a hour with all of the clues you need to get out. Of course there are distractions but staying on point is key. What a great way to bond with my daughter and for us to work as a team. Expertly assembled - tons of fun/ a definite adventure to change the pace of sightseeing/travel and a great additional memory together. Fun for all- don't see Prague without czech ing out Mind Maze!!"

Only one of us has had any experience in the locked room mysteries so it was quite a new experience.Booking was easy from their website and communications very clear. We were able to find the place without any problem - just be aware that Tyr\u0161ova 9, Praha 2 is on the left side of the main street Legerova as you come up from A.P. Pavlova station.The staff was very welcoming and helpful and explained everything. For us beginners we were given relevant hints at the 15 minutes mark to help us get moving. It was lots of fun and challenging. The tricks were quite ingenious. Everyone enjoyed it."

Within the one hour of allocated time you try to solve a series of puzzles to get out of the alchemist chamber and it was very funny and captivating. The puzzles are well thought, neither too easy nor too though. Everybody enjoy this moment that can nicely help to warm up in a inside playful activity.Finally, the rates are not expensive (50 euros for 5). You definitely must not come to Prague without visiting MindMaze."

We got three hints, and twice we were just about to do what he had told us to and if he had properly looked at the camera feed of the room i think he would have seen that.

The staff gave us a few hints over the radio when the few times we appeared to be stuck. In the end we made it in 54 minutes and we had fun the whole time. Higly reccomended"

We are quite competitive people and I think as time wore on we were more and more determined to make it out. It was such an adrenaline rush when we finally made it with less than a minute to spare. The puzzles are just the right level of difficulty and we spent the rest of the day feeling pretty chuffed with ourselves. Have recommended it to everyone"

Throw yourself into the puzzle, once you build up some momentum- it's brilliant! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful game masters.

I'm not sure if he was really watching because at one point he thought we were behind and gave us a hint for a puzzle we had solved almost 10 minutes prior (we solved it out of order).2- the price was a bit much for two people (the price is fixed per room). I understand that they still need to make money but there should be an option to team up with other small groups.In conclusion, there appear to be multiple companies offering this kind of experience now. This was the first escape maze that I have done but there was nothing in this experience to make me think that it couldn't be replicated by someone else just as well.I wouldn't be afraid to try another company if you can find a better price."

We managed to make a booking just 2 days in advance for the Alchemist's Chamber and it turned out it was just 2 mins walk from our hotel! Perfect! Of all the great things we have done on our trip to Prague we have found this one to stand out as it is something so different to the norm. The puzzle is so well thought out and enough of a challenge for us twenty-somethings to find it both exhiliarating and frustrating - we made it out with just seconds to spare!! I can imagine families and groups of older children loving this experience as well. The staff are very helpful and friendly and this experience is well worth the money! A must-do if you are in Prague!!!"

We were staying close to the place so I though I'd give it a try even though it was one of the more expensive things we done in Prague (I speak relatively to other attractions in Prague.)I was even more worried about how my wife would react as when I told her they lock us in a room and we had to get out, her face dropped.I needn't have worried. As soon as we entered the Alchemists Chamber we had a problem to solve and we both set about it despite having arguments along the way! Problems were set easy to difficult, some of the clues were to throw you. Not everything is as it seems and some lateral thinking is required. We missed some obvious clues which set us back but at all times our guide who was watching us, threw us some hints and put us on the correct path. We didn't finish the room but we got pretty close. There were only 2 of us but the room can accommodate 6, I think 4 people is the right amount to get those brains working together (and also make the challenge relatively cheaper).I'll certainly be going to the other room if/ when I go back to this fabulous city.One thing I would suggest to the owners if they are considering expanding is create a challenge for Children. Some of the challenges were difficult enough for adults but something set towards 8-14 year olds would certainly keep parents happy watching from the outside in, maybe giving some hints just as our host did.Overall I really enjoyed this and I'll look up similar type of games when I visit other cities. Overall a rewarding experience."

Once we arrived we were locked in a jail cell and given 1 hour to get out and find the submarine blueprints in order to get out of the room itself. We had a great time working together to solve puzzles and find keys to various locks in order to get out. The background music and room design were superb, making the experience feel even more real. It is not possible to do this maze alone so it made teamwork as a couple so much fun. We would have gone back another day and done the Alchemist's Chamber room but they were booked.

We recommend you to be 2-4 people solving the case to get the best experience.Practical details: - You have to book in advance and the weekends are almost always full.- Kind of hard to find since it is located in an apartment building.- Cash onlyWe highly recommend this to everyone who visits Prague."

Everyone was friendly and made the experience very fun. we were in a group of two so we did ask for a few clues which were helpful. You don't feel trapped or anything its just fun. One thing I would say is don't be put off by the location, it's nice that it's hidden away as a sort of secret, but it is a bit strange going into a building not in the centre of town. But as soon as we got downstairs it was completely fine :) Have a go at this! It's not expensive and you'll definitely enjoy it!!"

So since we got to visit Prague again we found ourselves again in one of their rooms. This one is their second room, a new one that had opened recently. The Enigma room was just as good as the alchemist. The background story was interesting, the sound effects and decoration made it all feel so real. It may be a bit harder than the Alchemist room, but we did it as a couple and made it out with time to spare. So if we can do it (and we're not that smart), anyone can. What a great way to spend your money. I know it's a bit more expensive than the other room escapes in Prague, but it's also the best. Also, I should note that the toilet outside is very clean, the place is very neat and aesthetic and the crew seems very nice and is happy to help. Do not miss it!"

ConsThe front door was broken. Made me feel like that was the first and last puzzle. Not Mindmaze fault, entirely on the building owner. The room was hot. This caused at least a little sweating and at worst me to get a little flustered. I chalk it up to the season and an unusually warm day outside. Bottom line if you have 60 minutes and 1200 czk you'd be an absolute fool to not walk through this beautiful city and experience Mindmaze. Worth our time and money at double!"

We had so much fun and was not expecting too much, especially when you walk up to a very unassuming red door with nothing but a small Mind Maze plaque next to a number of door buzzers! We were greeted by Thomas who explained how things would work. We would have 60 minutes to exit the Alchemist chamber and were given a walkie talkie to communicate with Thomas for help. He was very good at helping us out when he could see we were getting stuck and ensured that he didn't take away from the game. Would highly recommend it on your list of things to do when visiting Prague. p.s we finished the maze :)"

There were maybe a couple parts that would have been easier if we had more people but very satisfying when solving the puzzles.

If you were stuck you could ask for clues and the clues given were great only pointing you in the right direction.

We had to work as a team to complete the puzzles and challenges within an hour to escape the room. We managed to complete 'The Alchemy room in 37 minutes. It was frustrating at times, but the sense of achievement you got when each challenge was completed made up for it.I was lucky enough to visit their new room 'Enigma' yesterday with my team. The staff were amazingly friendly and offered me the chance to visit 'Enigma' 2 weeks before it opens to the public as it was my birthday. This room was challenging and has us stumped a few times, but we managed to complete it and escape just in time.Would definitely recommend Mindmaze for something fun and different for all ages from 12 up!"

My friend and I (a small team of two) had reservations about our ability to \"escape\" the room in our allotted time. Not only did we do it (with 30 seconds to spare!), but we received the perfect amount of guidance from George, who was watching us remotely. With his help, we were able to overcome a couple of head-scratching moments, but never felt that he took the fun of discovery out of the experience.

She was friendly and helpful and gave us a few hints via a walkie-talkie so we just managed to finish, a couple of minutes over the hour I think. It's a cross between Crystal Maze and a brain-game app you can download. You have an hour. Kristina showed us their new room alongside which looks great too. Based in WW2 with an escape from a prison cell as the theme. Worth the 43 euros we paid and you have to pre-book but I would say a little lacking in publicity and signage to make passers-by curious. It's just a few minutes from IP Pavlova (Metro and Tram) but it's easy to get disorientated after you get off the metro and try to follow a map because the metro has a number of exits.The roads nearby are the busiest in Prague so only cross on the crossings."

Our kids (7,5 and 5) just loved it as well, looking after any objects they could see and trying to solve puzzle, find keys and interact with our new findings. If kids are interested in puzzles and enigmas, they will be involved from first minute.Staff is great, they gave us 2 hints durign the hour in orde to let us evolve when they understood we were stuck (in fact, busy on wrong directions..). we managed to exit the room in less than 1 hour - safely :-)be sure to check availability prior to your trip, do not miss this amazing game!"

As a couple you have to work together to solve the puzzles and find the right clues. It was absolutely fun and we were a bit disappointed we couldn't do a second one right away. However, we promised each other to visit the one in Amsterdam as well!

But we did TERRIBLY! I think if you play escape challenges on the computer, you will do well with this, because you'll know the kinds of things to look for. But the woman who was our guide said that only about 40% of people solve the puzzle within the hour. That said, we had a TON of fun! If it were easy, it wouldn't be as good. And it was fun to meet the young Czech entrepreneurs running this small but booming business. Our guide was charming and showed us the solution when we were done, which we enjoyed. If you're wondering how to engage your teen during a family trip to Prague, definitely consider the Mindmaze. Great family bonding time!"

It's absolutely all that it's said to be in the rave reviews on here, and more. We went as a couple, and unfortunately didn't make it out in time - spent far too long on a couple of incidental steps and got fooled by one red herring in particular. Some things aren't quite what they seem (but that's the beauty of the game). A great mix of logic puzzles, some physical (not too physical) lateral thinking, and a bit of codebreaking. As others have said, the time absolutely flies by, and there's aspects of the puzzles that will appeal to all ages.A nice touch was the unhurried guiding through the parts we didn't get to complete (with encouragement to solve them ourselves as much as possible) so that we didn't leave frustrated - well, apart from the fact that I'm still really annoyed with myself for taking one particular thing at face value, which lost us a good 15 minutes or so.So much care and attention to detail has gone into the rooms themselves and the puzzles. We are really looking forward to trying the next room (currently in the final stages of being built) when we next come to Prague. Ideally, we'd want to do it right now."

After reading the reviews, we decided to book. What a great time! The concept is awesome and the thought that went into planning this room (we did the Alchemist) is spectacular. I don't want to give too much away but, you are put into a room (they have another room and will have a third room in the next few months with a different theme) that is designed to give clues to find the Alchemist's stone and use it to get out of the room. You are watched by cameras and the guide will offer clues (in English or Czech) if you're having difficulty moving forward. It's the perfect group activity (only 4 people max allowed) and it's great fun for everyone. Our daughter loved it as did we and we actually made it out just a bit over the 60 min, (with some clues!)

There is nothing to complain about except maybe the location being a little difficult to find - the sign isn't too flashy so we spent a couple minutes looking for the entrance. Still, it is a Mind Maze, it shouldn't be easy to find in the first place! Once we got inside, everything was great, the maze host was extremely friendly and helpful and the quest itself was delightful. Will definitely check out any new rooms they set up."

We'd never done one of these games before but it was exactly what we'd hoped - a clever and charming way to spend an hour, escaping into another world as well as attempting to escape the room!A little on the pricey side when doing as a pair as it's a flat price whether you're a group of two or four, but such a unique and well-crafted activity we thought it was worth it. Really friendly and helpful service too. You are even offered a photo of the team at the end as a free memento to be emailed to you.Would whole-heartedly recommend to anyone who enjoys problem solving. We will definitely return to play the new room if we're ever back in Prague (the owner gave us a sneak peek into its preparation and it looks great!)."

The people were great and helpful and we even got to meet the brains behind the operation who was lovely and welcoming.

First of all, it's a little hard to find. the road that it's on is closed and it is in an apartment so you have to look close at the names. secondly, there was one clue, that us as a short family couldn't get to. and finally, there was one confusing clue that doesn't seem like you should get it at the moment, but you should! and (as a small family we could get it) but for some, they couldn't get it.

When we got there the woman was very friendly, asking if we had found the place easily enough and whether we were excited (we were!) She set the room up for us while we waited and gave us some instructions before letting us loose. It was SO MUCH FUN. The trick is to work together! Plus tips/hints are offered if you get a bit stuck so don't be afraid to ask! My friend and I completed it in 46 mins with only a few hints and we had an absolute laugh while doing it. As somebody who has always loved puzzles, mysteries and alchemy/magic/etc this was wonderful.Once again I asolutely cannot recommend this enough.

I booked it simply from the great TA reviews and told them nothing except that I had a \"surprise\" activity in store for them while in Prague. Actually, it was a surprise for me too, as the reviews don't (and shouldn't!) go into detail. An aura of mystery added to the fun. My mom (72 yrs) can't stop talking about how much fun it was. My cousin got onboard after it was about halfway through (I think she thought we'd be having some kind of strange seance ha ha ha -- which it was not of course ha ha)"

We barely escaped in time so that made the entire experience that much better. We have attended other escape the room games in other cities that were just stationary logic puzzles at a table, with no real room to explore/escape and no decorations or theming. MindMaze was totally different, you touch and manipulate your environment to figure out how to escape. There were logic puzzles which used appropriately themed, tangible objects to create a very well rounded experience that felt highly immersive. I play a lot of \u201cescape the room\u201d video games and this really felt like I was inside one of my video games! The alchemy theme was perfect too, we could not be happier with our adventure and we thank you so much for creating this. Now come make one in San Francisco!"

It was very challenging, made it out in 59 minutes feeling very proud and excited!I will recommend this place to all my friends going to Prague!Got sneak peak in their new room, which opens in May, will definitely come back to conquer that one too :-) Just reminder, they don't take card payment, so make sure you get cash before you visit. They state it on their website, despite of that, couple that was in front of us did not know and only just put their cash together.Many thanks for great time!!"

Imagine 'The Crystal Maze' crossed with an adventure game like 'Myst' (or better yet 'Zork Nemesis') and you might be picturing something like 'Mind Maze'. The puzzles are ingenious and complex, though always fair and solvable. The location is atmospheric and convincing. Object puzzles are much more satisfying than in a videogame since the sheer 'objecthood' of the things that you're using to progress through the locked room, gives the experience a sense of reality and tactility impossible to achieve on a computer screen.I'd personally recommend combining your visit to 'Mind Maze' with a trip to the 'Museum of Alchemy', since a little background information, while in no way essential, can enrich the experience. You also don't need to be Czech to solve the puzzles. My group's time at 'Mind Maze' was just wonderful and utterly worth the price (especially if split between three or four people)."

The initial panic as the door closed with no instructions soon subsided as we explored the room and soon found a starting point. the imagination and complexity of some of the ideas is impressive in itself - i take my hat off to the people who designed it. I'd love to be able to do this sort of thing more often and will have to struggle to not share details with friends who may want to try it for themselves! My only small problem was that the 2-way radio distorted the sound a little, so it was difficult to hear what was being said if there were hints being offered, so sometimes that took up precious time.

This was definitely the best experience I had in Prague and was the highlight of our trip. I would advise not to get discouraged finding the place, especially when the shops in the main street next to it don't even know it exists, which was quite unsettling. Just put a little effort into finding the place and getting in, and you won't regret it from there.We were two people and we were confident and conceited enough to think that were going to set a new high score. Despite being close, we couldn't even get out in time, even with the hints and the few extra minutes. Regardless of us not making it out, it was still a pretty amazing experience and when we finished we met the genius behind the maze and it was just incredible meeting the guy whose puzzle we couldn't overcome. I also have to give props to the girl who introduced us to the rules and was our connection to the outside during the game, she was very friendly and was helpful throughout the experience."

After booking online (without paying) and taking the time to go there on time, my girlfriend and I hesitated for around 5 minutes to actually buzz ourselves in. After all, how \"safe\" was it to just book something on Internet in a foreign country and show up there not knowing what's going to happen to you (except that they are going to lock you in a room for sure!). However, the moment we met the young lady who let us in and explained the game to us -which by the way was very professionally arranged-, we both knew that we are in for massive fun. IT WAS AMAZING! I couldn't believe my girlfriend taking such a game that seriously. We worked together and as it turned out that was the key to win the game -by working together I mean that we were communicating and explaining to each other what we found and how we thought the next courses of actions should look like. You'd be amazed how much stuff came up and was solved during these exchanges (a lesson for life). The merely one-hour experience was full of ups and downs and of course serendipity. With a bit of luck - a wild guess instead of solving the last puzzle - we escaped the room in 55 minutes.We spend quite some money in Prague but this one was definitely one of those that we wont regret (and believe me there were some!)."

You get to be in the room of an alchemist who supposedly found the philosopher's stone. Your goal is to find the stone and get out. We were two people and managed most of it on our own. It was really fun to see how our skills completed each other (one of us more code-theory oriented and the other more skilled with devices and handy work). The cool thing is that you get a radio station and can ask for hints if you get stuck. That way you can be sure you make full use of your time. The girl who was our guide was nice and helpful. The atmosphere was great too. At times I felt like in a real life point and click game, while my boyfriend felt like some kind of Sherlock Holmes. I recommend this 100%."

We were determined not to ask for help but alas even our 5 brains combined were not enough to solve the complex puzzles and clues to escape the door in an hour. So half a dozen calls to our helpful girl at the end of the walkie talkie meant we escaped the room with 1 minute to spare! Do have a go and try it-a fun hour to spend as a group of friends or family together and something a little different to talk about when home.Thanks for the experience and can't wait to try the second mind maze of world war 2."

After all how fun could it be locked into a room and solve puzzles for an hour? Well, it turns out it is ridiculously fun!After some pleasantly brief and clear instructions we were immediately led to the room. Coming into the puzzle room itself the we were instantly immersed in the atmospheric theme of the room. The combination of antique furniture and weird artifacts engendered a sense of arcane mystery which really added to the experience. As instructed we quickly started interacting with and scrutinizing every object in the room which yielded a bounty of clues and puzzles that needed solving. And even though we were with four people everybody always had something to do as there was always still a missing piece to be found or problem to be solved.The challenging puzzles are beautifully integrated into the room and it is extremely satisfying to solve them. On the rare occasion that we were completely stuck we got subtle hints that nudged us in the right direction without ruining the fun of discovery or those lovely \"EUREKA!\" moments. The puzzles are varied so they don't get repetitive and time simply flew by as we solved them in a focused euphoric state culminating in the final climatic discovery. Without spoiling too much I can tell you there is a nice surprise twist awaiting visitors towards the end.All-in-all I can't recommend it enough! Especially if you are a first time visitor and am as skeptical as I was. We visited another escape room in Prague (from TRAP) after this wonderful experience. And while it was enjoyable as well I definitely recommend MindMaze over the other one as it is just better executed and thought-out. Next time I visit Prague I won't hesitate to visit their second room!"

It will do wonders to family bonding.

            "review": "Challenging and Rewarding. To those familiar with the 'escape the room' format, this is a very well thought out 'real world' version which places you in an Alchemist's chamber. The instructions from staff are fairly simple, which I liked, just play with everything in the room - their suggestion was spot on as pretty much all of the fixtures and fittings are somehow involved in your quest to escape (with a few red herrings). They employ a two-way walkie-talkie system which allows the participants to ask questions and for the staff to give you hints as you go along. This is a very useful system and allows the staff to calibrate the difficulty of the game to the players' progress (they watch you via hidden cameras). The staff leave you alone at first but when hints are given they are circuitous enough to keep the game satisfying but not frustrating. There are lots of different types of puzzles which succeeds in keeping the game fresh for the entire hour.Completing the game is impossible without at least two people but I would be reluctant to recommend more than this as it may get a little crowded with more than this.My only issue was that at a couple of points there was ambiguity as to whether we had successfully completed a task - I don't think that the game benefits from trying to fiddle a lock open or attempting to press a button harder, perhaps some of the components susceptible to wear should be made of slightly more hard-wearing materials. There were also a few bits and pieces that detracted slightly from the illusion of being in an Alchemist's chamber - e.g., power extensions hidden under mats etc. Overall, though, a thoroughly rewarding evening, I just wish that their second room was already open (coming March apparently)."

Great decor, authentic-looking equipment and a couple of sneaky clues make it very engrossing. We would have liked a clock of remaining time in each room to add a little tension. Also a little more dramatic intro would have been nice and maybe costumes for the staff. Perhaps the instructions could have done via \"radio\" once the players were in the first room. Nonetheless, Eleanor and Honza were delightful and very helpful. We'll go back and try the other room when we can. Thanks for a good evening of fun."

Super nice guy :)!The game was challenging and unlike the other escape the room games that I have played. Not wanting to give away anything to other prospective players: I can say that the mechanics by which this game works are rather different to most other such games! I enjoyed that it was so different and high-tech. Refreshingly so!We finished in 46:48 and were completely stumped by one challenge (wow, that one was hard!). Thanks again to Jakob for giving us the hint we needed :DMy advice: go play \"Monaco Heist\" for a completely different approach to escape the room games!

Exitgame like this one, can be solved by almost everyone, it is a good thing to have a mixed group (also in between ages) you need to think in more than one direction to succed.To the RunAway team: thank you for the best time in Prague - we will return next time around (Keep up the good work!)"

We luckily found their number online and called to describe what had happened. The owner (a young couple started this business, we had the pleasure of meeting Tomas) was very friendly and arrived shortly after our conversation, even though he was not really working at the time.We really enjoyed the game! The tasks were difficult enough to be challenging, yet felt not by any means impossible. And if we were stuck Tomas would gladly help us. As a bonus we solved the mission in the very last second! It was quite a thrilling experience.The owner is extremely welcoming, and the game itself is very exciting, as well as rewarding (especially if you succeed in solving it).

The story takes place in 1950's communist era and the mission is to find documents and breakout of the room before the KGB agents arrive. The host gives you a walkie talkie so he can communicate with you and give you hints or tips if you should need them. The game was set up very well and it was really fun to play. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is thinking of booking something fun to do whilst in Prague."

The Nuclear Bunker room was by far the best one we played. The atmosphere is so real. We really felt like spies in 1950's. Everything is so well prepared and I was amazed at the creativeness of all the puzzles. This room is really unique, challenging and fun at the same time. Highly recommended!"

Well from the start we could see how professionally well run this place is. Our lovely host giving us a good welcome and explained how the game works, the rules and then the storyline which was very good indeed. It's hard not to get sucked into the game ahead as its all very well put forward by the staff. So off we went with 1hour to attempt the mission. It was so much fun, quite challenging, and we didn't really know what we were looking for at first but as the game progressed we soon got the jist! Maybe attempt this one without a hangover next time as we really had to use our heads! The puzzles and clues are all very well thought out and as you find secret compartments and drawers and cupboards it all just sucks you in to the game which is a lot of fun. Highly recommend this, and we will def have another go in the near future. Well done Breakout Prague!"

I was in the bomb room. It was quite hard to do (it was our first time also), and I don't think we'd have gotten far if he hadn't given us a hint or 5 in total.

The first room reminded us of 'Ghost Stories' for anyone who's seen the stage production, with different numbers written on the wall. After solving a couple of clues we were able to open the door to another room which was way spookier than the first - quite gothic. I won't give more details as don't want to spoil it for anyone planning a visit.If there was a 'downside' to the experience, it was that all of the clues seemed to be kind of mathematical - not my strong point - and I think we'd have done better if there'd been a mixture of maths and maybe riddles or something included.

The riddles were neither too difficult nor too easy for first timers. We were well received and afterwards we got to write our name on the wall. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try something exciting. We left with big smiles on our face and can't wait to come back and try the second room.

Answer: Brilliant fun and a good laugh!Having successfully completed two Trap escape rooms earlier this year in Budapest, we thought we would tackle the Bomb room on our recent trip to Prague. This particular room is rated as the most difficult of the three Trap rooms in Prague. Unfortunately, we appeared to have left all our logic and problem solving skills behind at our hotel. Suffice to say we needed more than a few hints and clues from the lovely, helpful young lady in charge. We unfortunately did not manage to diffuse the bomb within the hour but were allowed to finish the game. There was only the two of us and I think this particular game would be a little less challenging with at least three people playing. Despite not completing the game within the allotted time, we had a good laugh throughout (with not too much bickering) and would definitely attempt the other two Trap rooms next time we visit Prague. All in all, this is an entertaining way to spend an hour and we would certainly recommend it."

We have been the last group of the day and because nobody was there after us and we were a bit slower than we expected, she gave us ten minutes more to finish the game which was very kind from her. We haven't had any problem with the reservation or the staff or anything in game. I can recommend it also for english speaking people. It was a really fun hour an we would love to try also other games like Tomb room to have something to compare. Who likes escape game, this is something what you shouldn't miss."

We didn't stand a chance finishing all of the puzzles in time, mainly because it was just the two of us, but also because it was our first escape room attempt, so if you're inexperienced with the genre, make a group of three or more.The staff give hints through a telephone according to the team's progress and they also give extra time if they can. They prefer you succeeded than stopping you in the middle of the game. At least that was our experience. Ofcourse, you don't have to answer the telephone and hear the hints.Although I hate getting hints in puzzles, the hints seemed to be necessary to make up for our disadvantages, so it was still very enjoyable."

The second, the dungeon room was more challenging for us. I don't think our brains (or maybe our American schooling) let us think that way, but the \"helper\" that you call is super nice and gives you hints so you can see the solution, he didn't just give us answers. We had so much fun and would love to do something similar again! Highly recommend. I can see how more brains would help in solving the riddles."

We were then 'trapped' in the room and had to solve various puzzles, within 1 hour, in order to get out of the room again. The puzzles were well thought out, with a good level of difficulty. If you became stuck throughout the game, someone would phone you with a hint, in order for you to make the most of the experience.

But I would recommend this for up to 5 people as well. We completed the Tomb Room because it was \"medium difficulty\". It was perfect! It was challenging enough where we weren't thinking \"this is lame and easy\", but not insanely difficult or impossible. We left feeling like Sherlock and Watson (I was obviously Sherlock). They offer hints when needed through a phone, which was awesome and allowed us to finish in the time limit. We chose Trap Prague because they have been running these rooms for years (experience) and started in Budapest (well traveled ;)). However, if they're booked up, try one of the others in Prague- the experience is worth it!TIP: Use the hint phone! It doesn't pay to be stubborn and try to complete all of the clues yourself, because you might not finish in the time limit resulting in \"feeling like a failure\"."

I don't want to spoil it but the game was really fun we got out in 50 minutes with two people and we both really enjoyed it. we paid 1000 CZK which is the equivalent of $50 CAD. it's a bit expensive but I would say that it was worth it, they also have other rooms around Prague that you can play. we didn't have the chance to but I'm sure they would have been fun as well."

We had not ever heard about something like this until we read the reviews. I am so glad that we decided to try something like this. It is extremely fun yet challenging. We made our reservations the day before our trip for the Secret Agent room. While the game is meant for 2-5 people we had 6 people in our group, but it still worked out well. I am glad that the hostess still allowed our group to play. The object of the game is to try to figure out how to escape the room within 60 minutes. There is no fear factor so don't be worried about being scared or having to do something you are afraid to do. Its totally safe and fun. If you get stuck (which we did several times) the hostess can give you hints as to what you need to be doing. If you do not complete the mission within 60 minutes you can still take more time to finish it. When planning your Prague trip keep in mind that its a 15 minute introduction prior to the game (you find out your mission), at least 60 minutes inside, and probably another 15 after the game talking to the hostess and laughing about the experience. Give yourself about 2 hours for the TRAP.I think this is a great experience for adults and children alike. I plan on taking my two children (ages 9 and 7) to one of these in the future. They will have a great time helping us out. If you have a younger child it can still be fun for them as well. Even if you have a baby, I do not think that the baby will cause any problems during the game. I would still tell you not to pass up this opportunity. Our hostess, Lanka (I believe that is how you spell her name) was absolutely great! She was very sweet and friendly. Such a great hostess and two thumbs up to the owner for hiring such a fabulous person."

None of us knew what to expect and we were a bit put off when we turned up to see an apartment style front door, with only a buzzer for 'TRAP'. Once inside however, we were put at ease by the member of staff who made us feel welcome. As this was the first time any of us had tried an activity like this, it took us a wee bit longer to get the general idea, but once we got going, it was very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend doing this if you like puzzles/ trying something different. I think it's perhaps a bit too hard for young children, but for older kids/ teenagers it would be quite fun. I would definitely try another game if i'm in Prague again."

It was such a disapointment because the present themself as a proffesional company when infact they are nothing but a bunch of amatures.This was D worst experience we had in prague!"

The \"backstory\" sets up the \"escape\" well and the puzzles are quite good and in keeping with Soviet/Communist ERA spying. My only complaint was that the attendant spoke waaaaaay too long at the front and tore into the time available. As it was only my wife and I the time to solve got quite close to the next booked group's arrival time. The attendant called at least 8 times (worried abut the next group) which inevitably was quite distracting and made me just want to leave. If you have 4 (or more folks) the puzzle could be more easily solved, but as it was just my wife and I, the calls and monolog of the attendant really detracted from an otherwise \"pretty cool\" experience. #1 thing in Prague ? no! worth doing? on a rainy day, yes. Prague has so much more to offer, this was \"just ok\""

We decided to go for the 'tomb' room.We didn't really know what to expect or how many puzzles there'd be and even with 3 of us we had to ask for help via the walkie talkie Monika the host gave us. Once out of the first room we quickly realised we'd spent a bit too long deliberating in the first chamber, so if you're going - and you should if you're into puzzles - don't spend too long or you'll run out of time. You'll enjoy it more if you ask for hints and get the whole thing done. Afterwards Monika chatted to us, took our photo and you can write your names on the wall.Highly recommend, and we're already booked to do the other scenarios."

It was the perfect level of difficulty- challenging but not impossible and the rooms were really authentic with a good variety of puzzles! Would recommend to anybody who wants to try something a bit different and enjoys a challenge, for a good price too :) Although it's aimed at tourists, it doesn't feel touristy which is definitely a nice change! And the girl who welcomed us in, Pavlina, was so lovely! We went as a couple but it's good for small groups, and you get the place to yourself. Would go again to something similar!"

Look for number 8 and head into a small internal courtyard surrounded by apartment buildings.

It is a great way to spend an hour (53 minutes in our case) and requires concentration, lateral thinking and some common sense. Teamwork is essential so it is a great exercise/challenge on a family weekend but everyone can play a role. The old phones are there if you need a hint at any stage if only to suggest that the answer has been staring you in the face all along. Excellently thought through, good value, great fun."

We reserved a 9am time for our family of four (myself, husband, 15 year old daughter and 11 year old son.) Trap was a 5 minute walk from our hotel. We had a bit of trouble finding the location so give yourselves a few extra minutes to locate it. It is in the courtyard at #8 Senovazna but we did not see it listed on the directory. We joked that this was part of the puzzle. The host welcomed us and explained the process of being locked in to the Communist Apartment for one hour. We had so much fun and excitement searching for clues and trying to solve the puzzles. The host will occasionally call to provide a clue, and you can call her as well. Each of us contributed to solving the puzzles in some way. I would not recommend this for families with children younger than 11 but my 11 year old loved it so much he wanted to try some of the other similar venues in Prague.

After a week in Prague walking endlessly through the beautiful city and nearby Konratice forest, it was a relief to have an activity that was contained in a small apartment. Having no expectations and no idea on what the puzzles could entail, my husband and 2 children (aged 15 and 11) dove wholeheartedly into clue finding. When we were stalled, we were able to get some hints from Klara, our guide, who spoke excellent English, and was perceptive enough to \"suggest\" hints when we were close, but also perceptive enough to blurt out a hint with directives when we were completely lost. All in all, we finished the activity (going over 7 minutes), but Klara was sweet enough to emphatically congratulate the kids on finishing in time. When our 11 yr. old pointed out that we went over in our time, she sweetly claimed that we must've finished in time if we made it out alive! It was a fantastic activity, full of creativity and intrigue. The clue finding was not so impossible that our kids were able to figure out many of them. A MUST DO IT!!! A quick word on finding the place: stay true to the address and find the building. Look for the business listing on the wall with the doorbells. The guide was prompt when we pressed the bell, so don't worry. The building has a central outdoor patio leading into other business entrances and there is also a staircase leading into the second story. TRAP is one of the doors on that main floor, don't go up the stairs. Just trying to find it was the start of the intrigue."

It is also important that different team members concentrate on different clues in parallel, otherwise too much time is lost brainstorming together on the same lead. All in all, a highly recommended experience!"

My girlfriend and I both had a blast playing this game.I will start by saying that we managed to get out in 56 mins with very little help, which I think says a lot about how well organised it is. The challenges are such that they can be done in the amount of time given if you try very hard, but it is also very easy to miss out by only a few short minutes.The atmosphere of the place was amazing, with old moldy books and old paraphernalia really adding to the experience. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend."

It's such a unqiue idea -- I've never seen or heard of anything like it in the U.S. -- and very well done. If you like puzzles, you'll love this game. And the young woman who works there is so friendly and engaging, it made the experience all the better. She'll even give you hints if you need them, so you won't be stuck on anything for longer than you want to be. We failed the time challenge miserably, but still had a blast. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Prague. Try to book a slot in the late evening; it'll make the experience a little more intriguing.Two things to note: (1) it's located in an apartment behind a locked gate that leads out to the street. There's a sign on the building (and a buzzer to get in), but it can be difficult to find if you don't map it beforehand; (2) allow yourself more than an hour because they'll let you finish the game even if it takes you longer than the alloted 60 minutes. You won't want to quit before you finish, trust me."

The process is very simple - Plan the date and time you wish to participate and book via the website. You pay nothing upfront as this is done at the end. The cost was around \u00a330 for a couple. The booking is for an hour slot and can cater for a group of people. Finding the location is not too bad if you have a map. I'd advise getting an offline map of Prague. It's not far from the Powder Tower (Prasna Brana). Once you arrive, you are met by your host who explains the rules and general concept. The actual game/ puzzle was very good and is challenging. There are many clues in the game but are not always as obvious. I won't give too much away but there are some surprises and nothing scary or intimidating. There is no physical challenges at all. There is a pub next door but it wasn't very friendly. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience."

Mr. Lukacs will confirm the reservation.The venue is located not too far from the Old Town Square. Once there, you will find the items and \"puzzles\" retro '70's, challenging, interesting, funny and all very well thought out. You will wish there were more \"rooms\"..... The experience is not physical as one contributor mentioned, but it you are like my sister, don't hesitate to turn over a piece of furniture to find a potential necessary clue......! The price is worth every penny. A special thank you to Paulina who was our control person.

We had so much fun that we will seek this activity in every city that we visit.This worked great with our family and it would work as an excellent corporate team building event. Do not delay, make a reservation and escape the TRAP!"

I did this with my 20 year old son and had booked it as a surprise for him as this sort of thing is 'right up his street' so to speak - it didn't disappoint. We took over the hour but did solve it in the end (albeit with a few clues from our watcher). It might have been easier with 4 as opposed to 2 of us but we never got bored or frustrated, and surprisingly we didn't come to blows (verbal or physical). I would recommend it to anyone with an hour to spare and I shall certainly be looking up similar games in other cities."

            "review": "Our family of 5 loved it. I am always looking for something unique and interesting to do that all 3 kids will enjoy including the adults. This isn't easy because if the kids love it, many times we don't or vice versa. While this sounded like so much fun, I thought it might be too challenging for kids in the age range of 10-12. I have boy/girl twins, age 10 and a 12 year old boy. Boy was I wrong!The owners were very friendly and our family felt quite welcomed. I won't reiterate what others have said other than to say the setting is in the communist era and you have to solve various puzzles in order to escape, having just one hour to do it. Similar to who wants to be a millionaire, you get a phone a friend (the owner) when you need it who watches you via camera and I'm sure has a few good laughs.I'm ashamed to admit that my expectations were low for my family to get out but seriously the only hindrance, if there was one, was me (mom) and I'm 54 years old. It was slow going at first as we all raced around having no clue what we were really suppose to do despite the clear instructions given to us beforehand. My younger son got very excited and I had to quiet him down a couple of times.After about 10 minutes with no luck and wondering if we were going to get anywhere, I figured out the first clue. Made me feel a bit superior and I started thinking that the only way we would escape would be if *I* could figure out all the clues in time until it became apparent that finding the first clue would pretty much be my only contribution for the rest of the hour. Well, it's not as if that should have surprised me. I told the owners I wasn't overly bright.After the first clue was found, we were able to go at a little quicker pace. I actually forgot about the time until the last 20 minutes or so. The owner called us once to give us a hint probably because she saw us keep bypassing a clue and then we called twice (I think) for hints but otherwise got out in the nick of time. Okay, my ten year old said we didn't get out in time but the owner said we had a minute to spare and I'm believing the owner. We were in another room away from the clock. Without giving anything away, one of the puzzles caused a delay where we couldn't do anything so that took some time.I was astounded at how much the kids figured out. Between them and my husband who is an engineer, we were able to escape. I truly believe if the kids hadn't been with us, we wouldn't have made it out in time. We needed a couple of hints but I would find it quite amazing if anyone was able to do the entire thing without one hint whatsoever. I think our family taking into consideration the age of our kids, did very well and no thanks to me either.If you are looking for a unique experience that is family friendly, I highly suggest this. Even if you have kids a little younger that cognitively probably wouldn't be able to truly help, the experience of being with their parents and acting as secret agents to try and help their mom and dad escape would be a thrill for them so don't let the fact that you have younger kids deter you. Just know that it will probably be you and your significant other that will have to solve the clues but you never know. You might be really surprised like I was. There were definitely puzzles that my kids could solve and/or help with. It requires cooperation and working together. Because I was off trying to figure out a clue, I didn't pay attention once to what the rest of my family was doing but if I did, I would have been much more of a help so going off in your own little world isn't a good thing.This was quite the family adventure and one of those things that my kids will remember for a long time. They may not remember 5 minutes after you ask them to brush their teeth but they can tell me activities they did with us when they were 4 or 5 years old in vivid detail that even I have forgotten. It is truly amazing sometimes.Afterwards, we chatted with the owners and they let us try and figure out a puzzle box that they are working on that isn't quite completed. Great fun! If this is up your alley, you won't be disappointed."

Our guide was really helpful when we needed a tip and she was very friendly. One word of advice: don't overanalyze everything or spend too long trying to figure one thing out. At some points we should have just moved onto something else. Either way, give this a shot. It's an interesting activity, it's not too expensive, and it's worth the hour it takes.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was a bit hard to find (near old town square but off a side street) and the area seems a little bit shady at night, but it really isn't that far from the main touristy area."

My wife was pretty worried about this, being locked in a room, and when we found the entrance (that's the first tricky bit!) and looked in the \"rustic\" courtyard, she was even more worried (imagining some horror of an eastern European kidnapping - must cut down on watching the \"Hostel\"-like films!). I think the location and courtyard really adds to the experience, it gives it that extra air of a hidden secret agent's flat. Once we got inside and started talking to the host, he calmly put all her fears at ease. Very clear English speaking Czech, and a very relaxed handling of our time - there's no rush to leave exactly after the 1 hour as they leave themselves plenty of time to reset the clues and have a chat with you and take a picture.The room you get \"locked into\" is a retro lounge, and as soon as you start frantically trying to work things out, you get lost in the moment. Our 1 hour passed in a fun-filled flash, so glad we did this - as were our whole party. Not stopped talking about it since!You might think this isn't a very Czech thing to experience while on your short break, but it does have a Czech feel about it, you won't feel like a second of your Prague time here is wasted, believe me!"

I don't want to go into detail as this will spoil the surprise when you play but it was definitely a very entertaining and novel experience. If you enjoy playing games, geocaching or solving puzzles this will definitely appeal - and if you get totally stuck you can call for a cheeky clue.

The design of the puzzles was almost intricate.Would highly recommend going in a team sized larger than 2 - unless you've had prior experience with the TRAP franchise, or are just plain brilliant logician-types."

It was a really atmospheric experience in an authentically sparse cellar. We all loved it and found it appropriately challenging. We were relieved to solve it before our time was up but not so soon that it would have felt too easy. Robert was great in that he debriefed us afterwards telling us about clues we had missed, pointing out red herrings and telling us of places where other people had come unstuck!

It is the perfect way to bond with people you don't know that well!We were about 10 and therefore split in two teams (at that time only one room was open) and the group that went first had time to prepare the next activity while we were doing the same room afterwards - so perfect for time management as well.The communication with the Getaway team, was incredibly supportive and so was their warm welcome with a glass of champagne ready for everyone.The game itself is incredibly witty and for us blondes sometimes even a little bit too challenging :D, but that's what you have the rest of the group for. For most of us it was the very first escape game and therefore we didn't really know what to do, but the guys were super helpful and didn't make us feel stupid at all :).Seriously guys, who says this escape game is not good, did either not get it, wasn't there or kinda was a little too blonde to make it to the end ;).Peace, love and GetAway.Monika, the maid of honor and the rest of the gang <3"

I was impressed with the twists and turns the game manages to get in relatively short period of time. Some serious out of the box thinking is required and our daughter seemed to excel in that. It combines all the elements well (mystery, detective work, fun and logic). Whilst creepy it is never too scary for even the smaller kids to enjoy. Cannot recommend it highly enough for a pleasant family bonding afternoon."

The staff are super nice and were helpful when we got stuck on one of the clues without giving away any answers; so we still felt like we solved the problems ourselves and it was very satisfying! Unlike an escape room I had been to in Australia, the challenges were not un realistic to solve in the 60 minute timeframe that you are given.The only downside was the difficulty of finding a carpark during the week, but if you get public transport it's only a short walk from the tram station. Also there is no sign out the front, only a small sticker above the doorbell saying GETAWAY. So give yourself some time before you go to find it so you don't run late.A bit thumbs up for this escape room!"

The experience starts with first steps down the basement (former civil defense air raid shelter) and goes on till the end. You need to solve different types of puzzles just to unlock others ;) But don\u00b4t worry, should you get stuck (which we did several times) just let Robert (gamemaster) know and he\u00b4ll give you clue but not the answer (so you still solve it yourself). Robert is great, intelligent, free and talkative guy.110% recommended!"

The game is in the basement, a bit unusual but when we got in the game we understood the concept in a second. Our host was Robert, told us the rules and took us to the Prison game. I can't really say much about it without spoiling the game, but we enjoyed every single minute of it! We made it just a minute before the time limit, and it was a real blast! After the game we had a long chat about our performance, it definitely made us busy not only for an hour!"

We, the parents, were somewhat reserved about the activity, but went along. It was a blast! I recommend doing this with 3-5 people. Anymore and it could be more difficult. It takes a lot of teamwork, thinking out of the box, no fear of new things and good communication skills. If you think you have that, take the leap. You won't regret it, unless of course you don't make it out. Don't worry, it's only failure, nothing more.I won't give you any tips, although you should know that you have the option of having a walkie talkie to ask for help if you get stuck. As Robert will tell you, don't be afraid to ask for help. You might not need it, but you don't have unlimited time, so keep that in mind.You should also go into this with the understanding that this is not a commercial storefront, as you might expect. Its in a non-descript building, which actually adds to the mystery. I don't think I'm giving anything away here, but it is in an old bomb-shelter. Talk about secure and secluded. Don't be intimidated, its all good fun and Robert is very good at what he does.If you have the chance, do this, especially if you have a family of older teens or older. The family dynamic makes for an interesting time. It would be just as fun with a group of friends.Oh yea, we made it out with 11 seconds to spare."

I went on a usual weekday just to try something different with a bunch of friends who have played some other puzzle games in the past not sure what to expect but with some adrenalin anticipation if we would succeed and be able to beat some good times. The game proved well thought out and your mind would race to undiscovered clues and combinations. Sometimes we would stumble on clues that would not be part of the plot or so we would think but the game master did a good job at indicating the right path and putting us on track if we went off in search of paths that were not in accordance with the plot. The time flew very fast and although we did not have a specifically good time, we have all enjoyed to put our brains at work and being able to solve the plot albeit with some help from the game master. Would recommend to anyone looking for a new experience or outing whilst traveling to Prague and being tired of the usual sightseeing / clubbing / drinking activities. For certain you will have an entirely new experience and will get to have a great first person feel for a plot set in the history of the Czech republic. You ll experience the rush to solve the mystery and be glad that you took a crack at it."

I really enjoyed the story of the escape room and really liked the connection to the real history of Prague during WWII. The setting of the escape room was so realistic and the surprising twists and puzzles made it even more real. I loved watching my children get so involved in the game and working together to solve the clues. We made it out in 56:50!! Our host for the night was amazing too. I would definitely recommend Locked in Prague to anyone looking for a unique adventure in Prague."

            "review": "Almost excellent escape game. Scale of rating on Tripadvisor should have more options, sometimes it is very hard to distinguish between attractions having only 5 options. This place is really really good, a fraction from Excellent, though lacking a tiny bit compared to other games I rated so.First the positives: I really really like the decorations, it feels like you move to the 1940s. The beginning of the play is excellent and innovative, sound and light effects throughout the game are great (the ones towards end of the game make you feel like in a movie). You won't find any advanced technology in the room but hey, the acion takes place over 70 years ago! Puzzles are challenging, we got really got stuck at one by the end of the game and needed help. But we have finally managed to compete a mission. So why not 5 points and Excellent rating? Sometimes we were not sure where to use which clue and ended up in running from place to place trying to apply it. If you play in a group of two it makes you loose a lot of time and create a feeling of chaos. There are some ways to indicate the flow of actions so that players feel less lost, happy to share them with the owners. There is no countdown clock in the room so you'd better bring you own with you. Fix these two minor items and you'd deserve a full 5 from experienced escape gamers."

The booking process was quick and simple with no prepayment required. Our facilitator was very friendly and offered just enough help and guidance as and when we needed it. The No. 9 tram stop is just a hundred yards away making the location easily accessible from the Old Town."

We were welcomed in a very nice lounge area and were put right into the context of the 2nd World War. After that we literally traveled in time. We arrived at the overwhelming 1940s' interior. I love old decorations over the walls. Moreover I especially like the flow of the game which was underlined with a touching story. (I can not reveal it, though.) As far as the difficulty of the game is concerned, for us (4 players) it was manageable to solve puzzles in time, however we got stuck 2 times and asked the staff for help. I appreciate the \"mechanical\" puzzles which we all enjoyed most because we are not \"deep thinkers\".Concluding that I strongly recommend playing this escape game. It is worth it. Well done, guys!"

The rooms are beautiful and well planned, whith many lights/sounds that contributes to the mood.The puzzles are challenging but logical as well, so you can solve most of them without any help. But when help is required, you are given a clue by the operator.The room is suitable for non Czech speakers too! We both enjoyed very much and i sincerely recommend you to try it !"

These guys really invested in the production value of their rooms, as they are all superbly decorated and create the right atmosphere for the game. My mom and I did the bank heist room and thought it was very well done, but we were surprised by how short the game was, as we finished in about 35 minutes. It was our 4th escape room, and we have never finished a game with more than 5-6 minutes left before. It's not that the puzzles were easy - some of them were quite tricky and all of them were entertaining - it was just that there were fewer steps than average. I still very much recommend this place, especially for beginners. They showed us their two other rooms (the zombie room opens next month) and they both look great as well. Also, the staff was very friendly and helpful."

Both of the escape rooms are well thought out and have plenty of challenges, each in their own unique way. Both have obviously had a lot of thought and you can even get a preview of their next escape room. Without spoiling the contents of either room we would highly recommend doing them, even if there's just two of you. Thoroughly enjoyable and perfect for a final day activity if you have an evening or afternoon flight. The highlight was that neither room required any prior knowledge or particular expertise, and all the puzzles can be solved through pure logic."

Went while on holiday with 4 adults (my parents and 18yr old sister, I'm 22) and we were worried it would be too childish especially with the Harry Potter theme but it really wasn't. It was aimed perfectly at us, but I think younger teens would have managed, while it keeps adults entertained too. There were only a few voice overs but they were in English, though I'm assuming there were other language options. Overall a great hours activity, worth the twenty minute walk from the city centre to get there and great value for an afternoon of fun. Bit more detail, but no spoilers I promise: There are three rooms, but you cannot get into the second or third until you have completed challenged to open the door. The aim is to find three items and place them in the correct order in the first room. The first object is in the first room, the second in the second room and the third object in the final room etc. It is good to remember to go back and forth between the rooms in case you have missed anything. The advice given at the beginning was very clear and we felt well prepared. You have the option to ask for help if you want it, but you won't be given the answer, just a hint!Suitable for anyone, especially those who love Harry Potter, but the theme isn't everything, so long as you can imagine a magical scene, you will like it."

We chose Questerland as it sounded more technologically advanced that other games and we liked the Harry Potter theme.Questerland is rather a way out of the city and it took around 45 minutes for us to walk there from our hotel on the border of New Town Prague. However, it was easy to find. The lady who welcomed us and guided us through the game was very friendly.We got to select our wands and entered the first of the 3 rooms, which was very well done and just challenging enough, as was the second room. We struggled a bit with the third room as there were lots of red herrings and at one point it looked like we would run out of time, but as she could see we were very close she gave us another 1 min 6 secs and we made it out! Phew!This is a very well done games room and they are developing others at Questerland, which sound like a hoot. I would recommend going with a group, as it helps to have more than 2 or 3 of you to complete the task."

We did it with 20 minutes left, but we spent 15 minutes on the last part of the game because we were being stupid, so we did it pretty fast, but let me just say I hope you're good at math, so if you're planning to do this, get practicing, I'd have been stuck in there for my entire life time if it was me alone (yes, I suck at math :D) The woman that told us the info/rules etc was nice, very friendly, welcoming etc. There is also a new room being made there which will be awesome I'm sure.

            "review": "A new market leader? Probably. Prague is fast becoming saturated with Escape games and since Questerland opened in September of last year around 50 games have opened up in a short space of time. Questerland currently has two rooms open, a bank heist and the intriguing Howarts style Wizard room. I have play a fair few bank robbery games and no particularly looking forward to playing it; I had only really come for the Wizard game. I left loving both. The bank game was a masterpiece. High quality puzzles with a well crafted use of technology that doesn't overwhelm but compliments the game objectives perfectly. We escaped this room with about 15 minutes to spare. It was adrenaline filled and left you wanting more. The games master was really keen to take us back in side and talk about what our team liked. Before we played the Wizard game I was lucky enough to go back into the new game they are in the process of constructing based around a zombie virus. I know for some of you you might grown and. I likewise am not a big fan of zombie escape games but this one looked incredible. They are using film set specialist and it shows. Now the the finale. When we arrived a Czech family who had never played escape rooms before were being briefed. The wands they are given are not just for show. They actually 'do things' in the game. You are free to exclaim lumos if you wish but it is not necessary but yes the wands are an integral part of the game. This is one of the best examples I have seen of using technology to heighten the sense of magic. It really worked. Questerland is highly recommended, it has the right balance of puzzles, technology and amazing set design. My trip to Prague has led me to drastically reevaluate my top 10 list of games. Questerland is a definitely in there."

Overall we liked the experience but we needed some hints to get to the end. Once you start looking in the wrong direction, it is hard to see the right path. But needing hints did not impact our enjoyment. Our twin daughters of 12 which do not speak czech or english did also enjoy it very much.The room is a bit outside the center of prague but we also visited the park nearby and ate very cheaply in the neighborhood. So it shows a different side of prague as well."

            "review": "Family friendly -- our kids LOVED it <and we had a great time too!>. We decided to have our first escape room experience in Prague. After searching through the many possibilities we chose Questerland b/c of their wizarding themed escape room. Our kids are big Harry Potter fans and we thought that would seal the deal. There were only a couple of slots left for wizarding room, so we signed up and were promptly buzzed in about 10 minutes before our time slot. The staff were extremely courteous. They let us lock up our coats and gave us a sit down brief on how it worked. We have (2) boys, ages 10 and 12 and I was worried they might not enjoy the challenge of solving puzzles, riddles, etc. I couldn't have been more wrong! They had a blast. Although we haven't been to any escape rooms before, I was very impressed by the decorations and props that were part of the game. We had access to the hosts via a speaker in one of the rooms. They did a GREAT job of letting us work our way through the clues and only helping us if we seemed like we were stuck. Of course they also gave us the option to request no clues if that suited us better. :-) It was a wizarding theme and there are obviously copyright laws they must observe, so don't go in expecting to see Harry Potter's picture and Hogwarts castle,...but it was EXCELLENT if you like that theme. I think it's very appropriate for Potter fans. With a little help we managed to escape at the 54 minute point. Again, our first time w/escape rooms, but we had a great time, and more importantly...our kids had a great time. I highly recommend."

            "review": "Harry Notter . I so wanted to love this attraction as I'm such a huge Harry Potter fan but I just couldn't. Before I start, I've got to credit the guys there for doing such a good job on the theme. If you've not done many escape games and you're not worried about the quality of the clues, and you're more interested in the overall theme of the game then this is definitely one to go and play! However, the clues and the whole interactive side of the game fell flat. We were told during our briefing that we could only use our wands on certain shaped, interactive areas within the room but this turned out to not be the case. The interactive side of things also meant we had to keep stopping and starting, waiting to watch videos etc. which wasn't ideal as we were against the clock. The game also involved us calling the guys working there when we needed clues, and although they were helpful, their level of spoken English wasn't good enough to be answering in-depth questions in timed conditions. It slowed us down and caused us a lot of confusion at times. The final flaw for me was the third room, which was so daunting it made it almost impossible to solve. There were almost too many red-herrings and too much to try and absorb in the last ten minutes of the game. I think that this game is trying to be too many things - it wouldn't be overly difficult if the interactive element was limited and obvious, but there's no indication as to how much you should rely on it and as a result rely heavily on the team there to give you clues, which end up becoming answers as they were so expert in the technological side of things. It feels like more of an interactive experience where the traditional escape game element is an afterthought and for me, that's not what I was looking for."

We had an amazing time in the hackers nest room- the design of the game was excellent- I've been to games before where the decoration was lacking but this one really felt like you were in the hackers nest and to save the world was your mission! The puzzles were all logical/common sense so we didn't have to worry about knowing anything we didn't know. Really good escape game- would recommend to anyone looking for good fun and a challenge. Proud to say we saved the world with 7 seconds to spare!"

Had a great time figuring out the puzzles. We didn't finish quite in time, but there were only two of us - we're told that's not uncommon. No one was booked in the next time slot so we were allowed to continue working it out."

We successfully completed this room as a team of two and agree that it is a fantastically designed room with some truly original, imaginative puzzles and some of the coolest props I've seen in an escape room (the \"computer door\" you see in pictures is really amazing). It is also a very tough room - we used about 3 hints when we were completely stumped. The use of technology is really good as well, true to the hacker theme. Unfortunately some of the technology didn't perfectly work during our play through, but the game operator helped us through and it wasn't terribly distracting. There is also a pretty heavy reliance on padlocks with number codes - something I'd ideally like to see less of. Overall I would definitely recommend this room to people who have done a couple escape rooms before (it would NOT be a good room to do your first time) and are up for a challenge. The staff said this room has about a 20% success rate and is \"one of the hardest in Prague.\" I've done about 7 rooms now and the originality in puzzles and production value make this one of the best and hardest."

It is situated in the old jewish part of Prague only 15 minutes to walk from the Charles Bridge. It was my second escape game so I thought it could be boring for me but far from it - I would recommend this game also to people who had done dozens of escape games before. WHY?1. a true story?!after making the reservation only which was quite easy we've reached The Chamber at a sunny afternoon. Standing in front of the house you don't count with an escape room behind these walls because the house looks like a normal dwelling house. Inside the two friendly girls have told us the history about these rooms and how it comes to open an escape game there. It has been a normal appartment before and some decades ago a grim man had lived there. Nobody talked to him and some of the neighbours were scared of him because they didn't know what he was doing inside his walls. To find it out was our challenge, so let's start.2. The Mysterious OfficeWe entered the office. The race against the time has started. The level of difficulty is 80% what means that The Chamber also have some other rooms which are a bit harder. But as we were 5 persons who didn't have experience in Escape Games exept me, we've chosen this one. It is awesome if you find the solution of one task and take the next, step by step we neard us our destination. But then ... (experience yourself :)3. RecapAll in one we didn't managed it in 60 minutes. But we get the chance to end the game which was very nice. So after 70 minutes I think we've finally had the solution and the answer of the question what the old man who was a doctor had done inside his appartment. 10 Euros for 1 hour of great tension, happiness if it goes further and team spirit. I would say: it is worth it. So do not hesitate to book it. Have fun!"

The Room, is perhaps one best escape rooms in the world or at least on 2 continents. It was perhaps fitting that I should celebrate by playing a couple of rooms at The Chamber. The Chamber is within walking distance of the old town in the Jewish quarter. It's opposite a cool South American bar that does excellent cocktails. There is a flag flying above the door. We were greeted by a very enthusiastic host who took us a waiting area. She explained the rules of escape rooms very and clearly talked us through the back story. We played the mysterious office first, a classic escape room that didn't fail to deliver on all the key measures. Coherent, well thought out puzzles that tested logic and brain power, the room itself placed a high premium on attention to detail, and the a number of a wow factor that left you satisfied in the victory of escape. This is an above average game and certainly would be a good introduction to any novice. You may have noticed that escape rooms are popping up all over the place, lots of prison breaks, bank heists, virus outbreaks and secret agent mysteries. This half term I tried to book unusual rooms and that is certainly what you get with Hackers Nest. It is not just something different, it is something very special. The Hackers Nest is able to perfectly blend, high tech room design, logical puzzles and a high volume of wow factors that leave you desperate to play again. The level of detail will astound you and make many other rooms just look weak. I'm not giving anything away by saying take a moment to study the door. It is the escape room equivalent of the Iron Throne. If you play one room in Prague, then play this one. If you are in Prague in the next few weeks you will get the chance to visit the new games the Chamber is opening. I will return next year hopefully to play them too."

However this was a good thing, and we felt it added to the fun.We decided to do the Hacker's Escape game on our first night in Prague. It made a great alternative to a night out and was easy to locate, close by the old town square. The man who welcomed us to the game was friendly and obviously very passionate about his job. To say anything about the game itself would risk spoiling the enjoyment. However, there were some very clever twists which incorporated the street the building was on and involved computers and hi-tech gadgetry.Highly recommended."

The booking process is very easy on their homepage and we had a hearty welcome when we arrived. The staff is very friendly, gives a great introduction (5-10 minutes) into the background story and the \"rules\" of the game and all of the member we met speak English perfectly, which makes the game suitable for tourists as well. We visited the \"Mysterious Office\"-room first and we were so blown away that we booked the second room\"Hacker's Nest\" immediately after we arrived at home. Both of them are so detailed and atmospherically well designed that you are immersed in the story from the first second on. The puzzles and riddles are clever designed and unique, but can be solved without hints in the timeframe of 60 minutes. All in all, a great Escape Game that I can totally recommend. So check them out and have an exciting and entertaining time like we did! 5 Stars and more!"

The story has been basedin on rumours about a pre-war inhibitant of that very flat. The decorations, featuring old postcards and prints, were more than appropriate for that purpose. Our guide, Monika Grzelak, has been helpful when it was needed, and - what's even more important - patient enough to wait before giving additional piece of information.

We opted for the 'Hacker' room as we are fairly experienced players and wanted something a little more modern in comparison to the other rooms we usually do. The room itself was fantastic, slightly different from other rooms in the sense you don't actually have to escape but is by far the most thoughtfully constructed and every minute detail considered - we were both really impressed.We needed an extra couple of minutes to escape and the lovely girl on reception gave us a couple of extra minutes and she said we were so close to completing the game! I would suggest you do this room if you're in a group of 3/4/5 or an experienced couple otherwise, it might take you a while to get going and get your head around the clues!

To be fair, the guys did warn us that the room is very tricky and rather long - there are about 20 difficult puzzles to solve. We had four left at the end, which were shown to us after our time ran out. It is possible to buy an extra 15 minutes, but unfortunately we had no Czech currency left, leaving Prague directly afterwards.I like that this room and the story behind it was pretty modern. A nice change from Soviet bunkers and World War 2 prisons etc. This means that there were puzzles which are more modern too. I can't say more without saying too much. I probably wouldn't recommend this particular room to other groups of two, unless you just want a huge challenge. We did, so didn't mind not finishing it.The Chamber offer other rooms that are not so complicated, for a higher chance of success.If you are in Prague and like this sort of thing, definitely check it out!"

For the beginner I definatelly recommend The Misterious Room, if you dare and you are experienced enough, go for the Hacker. We have spoken with the operators and the company plans to open the new games (hopefully soon) so me and my escape game gang we cannot wait to see and try them soon! The Chamber keeps the best quality and standard in this sector in Prague so this attraction is highly recommended!"

We devided into two groups, one of which tried \"The Mystery Office\", and the other \"Hacker's Nest\". I was a part of the group in the latter room. The hosts were very friendly, spoke english well, and made sure we understood all the rules and premises for the game. Since it was our first time in an \"Escape room\", and our group had a more advanced room, we agreed to get help if they though we were stuck and needed it. We got help several times, but still solved most of it alone, and had a blast. I would highly recommend this for small business trips, such as teambuilding! I will return again next time im in Prague, and try one of the new rooms they are opening."

            "review": "What a Great Time...Highly Recommend for all Ages. We spent 3 days in Prague. I had read about these \"escape games\" here on tripadvisor. We are both in our late 50's, but our daughter and nephews and nieces play these types of games on the computer. They are hidden object, puzzle games. My husband and I have played them a little. So, the premise here is that you do a game in real life. The Chamber has 2 rooms...we did the easier one called the Mysterious Office. That being said this wasn't easy..it was fun and challenging. The Chamber was only a short walk from our hotel near the Old Town Square. If you are traveling with teenagers or young adults, and you've gone to a bunch of museums and churches....take a break and do this. Total time will be about an hour and a half....very doable and still see all the Prague sites. We stopped by one morning (they open at 10). We did not have a reservation, but they had an opening. Annie was very helpful and explained the whole process. We go in...we have an hour...she watches us the whole time and offers hints if we get stuck (via walkee talkee). I won't give anything away, but there are lots of surprises and we took 1 hour 20 minutes...but we are not skilled at these, so we were happy. The room decor was cool and all set in the late 1800's. It was 1000 crown or about $40 for the game. That is total, not per person. Afterwards, we did the 5 minute walk to the square rewarded ourselves with beer and wine. Go, you will love it!"

The puzzles had a really good flow to them creating a really nice story.We were advised that if something doesn't move easily it shouldn't, this is basically true, but you do need to search well, as some elements might require a deeper look. The only negative was a couple of locks were a bit sticky, so it could appear that the right number was incorrect. Overall though, a great way to pass an hour.

The guy at the front desk was really nice, he answered all our questions ( since this is our first time ) and it worked for us. We have 4 kids in our group, they loved it, and since we are going to Budapest next, we got a recommendation from the receptionist. It's not easy, and it's not hard, it's just challenging. We were ecstatic when we made it out with four minutes to spare. It's only like 50 euros, really cheap, and totally worth that price. I'd do it again in a heartbeat!"

This game is very well built. We got so many \"a haa!\"- experiences and all of the clues finally made perfect sense. It was very entertaining and fun for us. It was also bit scary and surprising. This game was in English at least for us. You can manage this game with very simple English. When you understand instructions given and can count to ten you will be perfectly safe :) :)  Ok, I can't help but brag that our group solved all the puzzles and get out in 40 minutes with only one clue <3 hahaa :D Man who worked there was also adorable and funny :)"

I've never done an escape room before and I will certainly do another now that I know how fun they are!! The chamber sets the bar high"

I cannot emphasize enough how fun it was, by far THE highlight of our weekend @ Prague, and that says a whole lot. We were that blown away that we changed our plans and made room for another escape room, on the day of our flight home!Thomas, who gave us instructions via Walky Talky, was the nicest and coolest guy. He gave us much needed clues in such a manner that we still were banging our heads against the wall and figuring stuff out on our own. He had a way of kindly helping us, while savoring the experience of a challenge. He was remarkable. The Chamber is challenging, meticulously created, provides a crazy adrenalin rush, and a very memorable experience. I kid you not- you must do it. Not should. MUST."

This was the first time I had ever visited a puzzle room so was a bit dubious about it when my partner booked it, but what an inspired choice he made (his brownie points went up big time). Right from the very start of the time in the room it was engaging and surprising. It is very well thought out and put together and I have to say that the time raced by without even being noticed. It is brilliant, fabulous, engaging and fun and just when you think you have cracked it and you have the key in your little paws, there's an unexpected twist, but no giving the game away. It is a wonderful experience that should not be missed. Love every second of it."
