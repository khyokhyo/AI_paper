The window displays and communal areas were a delight in themselves. Oh and there's air conditioning here mmph we liked that.Amazing range of designer shops as others have said you could buy anything from soy sauce to a designer dress and a car all in one shop We enjoyed visiting shops unique to Thailand and retail chains not available in the UK .On two separate occasions big promotions were happening inside and outside the centre They were having a Benefit makeup exhibition on one of the floors the artists demonstrating were beautifull and thier expertise was incredible seeing the transformation of some of the young girls was quite breathtaking to watch.The food hall on the ground floor was vast and you were very spoilt for choice French macaroons looked good then Thai banana rotis looked better oh boy the choice was immense.if food shopping is your penchant come to Siam paragon they have an amazing selection of everything you could want and if you are self catering for yourself this is palace to buy ingredients.Come to Bangkok with an empty suitcase and big wallet and if you like structured shopping without the heat haggling and hassle of markets and street vendors come to Siam .Make sure the men in your party do something else whilst you experince this wonderfull shopping mall there is an aquarium downstairs for younger children and bored men to enjoy."

There are so many great stores and restaurants in this gigantic mall that even a whole day isn't enough. Superbly air-conditioned and with wide, spacious areas to move through the various levels of world-class stores, the Siam Paragon is a must visit highlight in Bangkok. Been there dozens of time now and will still find new and exciting shopping opportunities when next I visit. Truly a world class attraction for top quality service and merchandise, and then there's the many top class restaurants from cheap to indulgent. Not to be missed!"

Siam Paragon is a bit excessive in some ways, and you might wonder how the Gucci-type establishments can survive with no apparent business. But go downstairs to the food court, mosey into the upper-scale market and you can make your own salad, pick whatever kind of steak your stomach may desire (Wagyu from Japan, the best Black Angus from Thailand, and the best available from Australia and USA; or any of a broad range of sea foods; or a wonderful selection of ham, salami, etc. from Spain and Italy. Plus a wide range of wine to suit any taste or budget. And it can be cooked right on the spot, however you want it prepared, with various sauces on offer (you don't want to use any sauce with Wagyu, which is wonderful just the way it comes off the grill). Cooking costs THB 100. OK, the atmosphere is far from great, just sitting in a nice supermarket. But the food is fantastic and you would be paying at least twice as much (maybe 3 or 4 times as much) if you ordered a comparable meal in an actual restaurant. So atmosphere is poor, food is fantastic and the price is the best you can find for the quality of food you can consume."

It is very easy to get to on the Skytrain as there is a station directly in front and served by both Skytrain lines.You will see mostly high-end shops on the ground floor, but the upper floors are far more reasonable. If you have never been to a Uniqlo before, I suggest a visit (it's on floor 2). It is a large clothing store with a very good selection for men, women and kids. Their prices are quite reasonable and the quality is very good.Kinokuniya (on floor 3) is, I believe, the largest bookstore in Thailand. They have a great selection of Thai as well as English books, maps and magazines.Be sure to visit BeTrend on the floor 3 for some interesting gadgets.On the lower level you will find a very large selection of restaurants as well as a top-notch supermarket with a fabulous selection of meats, deli, rice, dried fruits, etc. The restaurants range from the usual fast food outlets to some rather high-end establishments. For good, inexpensive lunches I recommend Au Bon Pain or Piri Piri."

There's a wide selection of nice restaurants and the shops inside are of the range Bulgari, Prada and so on. The Paragorn Department Store has a nice toys department for kids. They could be busy there for a while. Aquarium Sea Life is also to be found here, it's in the basement. We didn't go there this year as we went there a few years ago.It's nice to do a shopping run from Gaysorn Plaza (not much changed since the last renovation, except for the escalators) to Central World Plaza. Then follow the skywalk towards Siam Paragorn, Siam Center and Siam Discovery (very beautiful at this moment!!). Ultimately, if you're not tired yet, you could visit MBK as well. Shopping will come out of your ears by then ;-) Although Siam Paragorn is nice to walk through, it's expensive shopping there. For dining there are some very nice options to be found!"

It is so easy to get to with it being adjacent to the Siam BTS. There is no reason not to visit this place while in Bangkok and with it being adjacent to Siam Square, there is even more things to do. I will continue coming here as long as I stay in Bangkok."

Having lived in Singapore, I was very familiar with the \"Paragon\" name and as soon as I walked in the mall it felt a lot like walking into Paragon in Singapore. The main difference is that this mall is larger and that there was almost no one in the mall and this was on a Saturday afternoon. There are lots of very nice department stores and boutiques and all of the luxury Brand\u2019s."

The food hall is impressive, carrying a lot of local and international chain of restaurants. One's shopping experience can range from luxe (think Hermes...) to street (Uniqlo). There's a quiet part of the mall - towards the other end of busy H&M, Kinokuniya and the cinemas. I have lingered there long enough to see several establishments come and go over the years.

I have been to the farm where it was founded and the business where it is made and distributed in Vermont, Massachusetts! That is worth a field trip if you visit Vermont! It is the best hard serve ice cream ever! There it was in Siam Paragon Food Court! I thought I was in a dream! Today I got 2 scoops of \"Caramel Chewie Chewie with chocolate chunks with caramel in them! Whoosh! The line was moving. I got 2 scoops because I noticed in Thailand that a large is often like a small where I am from. But today was the first time I ordered 2 scoops and really got 2 scoops. Today in celebration of the Queens birthday and Mother's Day any son that went in the line with their mother got a free cone! That may be going for the month? I shopped and got groceries at Gourmet Market - amazing! Had lunch at the Royal India. It was great delicious! But Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream was the Gold Medal in the Siam Paragon today! They even sell the same funky T-shirts there!"

Beware the crowd could be overwelming at lunch time and waiting time to get a table/seat groes accordingly. Go mid-afternoon. The upper floors are deserted. Direct access to Siam station.

It is a great enjoyable, nice, and cool place to even walking inside for shopping and seeing all the fashion of people around the world who were there. It is very easy and convenient to access by BTS train, cheap and fast! Not recommend visitors to go by taxi, the traffic on this road is really terrible! Next to Siam Paragon, there will be Siam Discovery Center, Siam Square, or walk in distance to Central World etc. One spot to start from here then move to enjoy shopping in various mall within walk in distance. A must go for visitors! Have great time shopping and spending money. "

The prices in the designer stores are more expensive than the uk but cheaper than places like China , for Louis Vuitton etc it's about on par with USA for items . The cinema here is insane , they have beds or you can see a film in 4D with moving chairs and smells etc . There is also a harrods cafe where you can both eat in luxury for around \u00a335 pounds , so it's much cheaper than if you were to actually go in London .I wouldn't recommend here for children unless you are going for the cinema but if you want a break from the hustle and bustle or simple want to shop for High end goods all in one place with air conditioning , this is the place for you . You also get free wifi and there is an uber pick upPoint ( cheaper than taxis )"

If you've been to the world's biggest mall (Edmonton was the biggest then in the 1980s and is sure to have lost that crown by now) I was slightly underwhelmed by this place. These sorts of establishments are not my most favourite places but it's air conditioned and there are plenty of coffee shops to revive your spirits when needed.

In fact, on our recent 4-day trip to Bangkok, we enjoyed no less than 4 meals at the Siam Paragon - including MK Steamboat (Thai style steamboat/ hot pot, Taling Pling (Thai food) and Beef Noodles at the food court.For us, the best part of the mall is the fact that it is seamlessly connected to the Siam BTS station (interchange) and is within a 5-10 minute walking distance to the other shopping precincts in the area like CentralWorld, MBK and the Siam Center/ Siam Discovery malls."

With several floors of designer jewelry, apparel, and services, it is the ultimate luxury experience for those who want Vuitton, Long Champs, Hermes, Rolex, Cartier, Zegna, and a host of other designer shops. You can even order your next Rolls or BMW. Although luxury shopping wasn't on my things-to-do list, I went to experience the delicious international restaurants on the lower level where they also have a gourmet food store. There were Japanese, Italian, Chinese, American (McDonalds), French, and Thai restaurants in abundance. Interestingly enough, with a proliferation of malls and shopping centers, this mall was jammed packed with visitors from opening till closing. There was a parade of school children walking through the mall, not to mention there are always a parade of tourists from all over the world. I especially liked the authentic Japanese Restaurants which served fresh sushi and delicious tempura and salmon. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food. I paid about 350 Bhat ($9.95 U.S.) for a Japanese teriyaki salmon lunch with rice, salad, tsukemono, coffee or tea, water, and a small desert. The McDonalds was very crowded by the way. I would highly recommend Siam Paragon as it is conveniently located just a few steps from the Siam BTS station and offers a glimpse into the Thai's love for shopping. Also, it's a nice respite from the heat and humidity."

The clothing departments upstairs are worth looking though though if you want clothing then you should also visit the MKM mall which can be reached by walking on the sky train walkway towards to the stadium station about 100metres, it's much cheaper and the vast range of stalls and outlets selling everything from phones to shorts is worth a look see.

With so many new malls coming up over the past few years and relatively quiet, it makes me wonder why Siam Paragon is still so bustling always.Location wise it is the interchange of both BTS lines. So it is really easy to get there without getting stuck in the traffic jam.There is a wide selection of dining choices from east to west, from economical to high end. I have been to the After You outlet there for 3 times in the past one year. There is always queue but manageable wait.For my son, he has been to Kidzania and Sea Life Ocean World previously. Costly entertainment but good alternative when it's too hot or raining out there. Do check out if your hotel concierge has any discount coupon for these two places. Large selection of luxury goods and well known chains such as H&M there. I like the Naraya at Siam Paragon compared to the Central World one as it is less crowded. Other than that, they also carry the higher end Nara and men's collection. Currently if payment is made using overseas Visa card for 3500 baht and above, can collect a free gift from cashier. Do remind them as it doesn't come automatic to them.It's definitely one of the shopping malls I don't mind going whenever I am in Bangkok."

There's Siam Discovery, Siam something or other, and Siam Paragon. The first was more like a modern fashion/interactive museum. Lots of people, no one carrying bags or buying! The second one I just walked through to get to the third. Everything in this one! From Hermes and Chanel boutiques to H&M, not to skip over the luxury car dealerships! Gigantic and confusing. The food court it really a whole floor of beautiful--and packed-- restaurants. Exotique Thai on the fourth floor was perfect for quality souvenirs, not much more expensive than on the street markets and with air conditioning, no haggling, and guaranteed quality. Lots of people and attraction watching, like two girls in evening gowns doing underwater synchronized swimming in a gigantic fish tank and taking selfies... To sell the new waterproof Galaxy phones.

With Emquartier shining far brighter as well as other mid range options that are friendlier on the pocket, seems like the only people who swipe cards at Paragon these days are the Chinese nationals.Yup the PRCs are the new Japanese in Thailand. Once decorated with jap wordings, most shops are now with Chinese characters. Who can blame them? China folk from the vast and many farms in the Chinese province have become richer and able to travel. And many find Thailand providing them more joy and bang for buck... or reminbi in this case.Skip Paragon if you are looking for authenticity. Head to an outdoor market or heck go to Central Ladprao.Siam Paragon is now a little Chinatown."

However, 50 mins is way to long for waiting.... Ridiculously slow service and not helpful staff. The cooking was not bad at all, but you can taste similar but better food else where for sure."

The first thing you notice is how clean and modern the building is. It opens at 10:00 and is spacious enough to house a drone of people who flock in every day. We went to Sea Life Bangkok (Ocean World) which is located at the lower level in the mall. After being thoroughly impressed by the indoor park, we tackled the food court. Yes, they have typical recognizable stores such as Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Channel, and other high end shops that could be found in any premium US malls, but what makes it stand out are the restaurants. We had lunch at Crystal Jade which had an impressive array of dim sum and yummy seafood dishes. We also had Ladur\u00e8e macarons. Honestly, there are a bunch of stands that offered macarons for a lot cheaper that are just as good. We had foie gras and white truffle macarons outside the gourmet supermarket in the lower level that cost less and much more memorable than Ladur\u00e8e's. Don't forget to try the eclair stand. I tried the Siam coconut cream eclair and it was heaven!It's extremely easy to take by Sky Train since its a major stop. Definitely worth visiting."

There are charming restaurants and a fabulous hawker food court. Yes, it can be spendy depending on where you spend your Baht. The Gourmet grocery store has a huge selection. They even has some natural or close to natural/eco products. There is a lovely selection of cold pressed fresh juices and green drinks. This is the first place on my travels in SE Asia that I've been able to find cold-pressed fresh orange juice not to mention passion fruit juice. Huge downside of the Gourmet Grocer was the amount of plastic used on the cheeses and especially in produce. I will bring my plastic back and try to reuse, but it is not possible to buy fruit free of single-use plastic. After picking up bag after bag of plastic on Phuket Beach, I'm shocked by the zeal with which grocers use plastic. There is literally no way to avoid packaging in this store.This best part about this mall for us are the offerings for kids and the food options. It isn't uncomfortably busy during the week, but gets pretty packed on the weekends, especially the restaurants, where you most likely will need to wait for a table."

Though I didn't buy anything, I did try the really amazing food court, which is filled with a huge selection of pan-Asian food at affordable prices.If you're a little bit scared of getting stomach trouble from the street food in Bangkok, Paragon's food court offers the same kind of delicious Thai and Asian food (primarily noodles and rice dishes) in a super-clean environment \u2013 though obviously not quite as exciting as grabbing it from a street food vendor.There's also McDonalds, Costa and various other chain brands should you be craving a coffee or milkshake.Really easy to find, right by Siam BTS Skytrain stop."

We were prepare to only window shop as we already knew that the prices there were not affordable. Really clean and their food court is amazing. It's like street food but in a clean environment and it has a gourmet market. I definitely wouldn't plan on shopping there. This is more a place just to window shop, see the cars, eat at the gourmet market or any of the restaurant and take an air condition break from walking. It's easily accessible and easy to get to. You can get here on the TBS or just by walking. It's close to the hotel and embassies area as well as three or four other shopping malls. We never really shop when we go on vacation. But I think this place is definitely worth seeing. "

Restaurants are NOT open for all day dining & closes at 2:30pm. Last order at 2pm.Unlike Central World, the walkway are small, so on a weekend, you're literally at elbows with people. Shops are disorganized. So you have to search for it.Not my usual favorite."

Want to watch movies and feel as if every single show you catch is the Premier? Want to uncover penguins and a gigantic aquarium hidden in a shopping mall's basement? GO TO SIAM PARAGON!!! Exciting things begin here. I came here for two to three consecutive days in a row. Spent a day at KidZania, another at the Underwater Aquarium. These are excellent places to take your children and family. Love the array of snacks and food choices here. Siam Paragon is also home to the much raved about <After You> dessert establishment. Prices for the food court is exorbitant by Thai standards, but still an affordable option, if you're on a budget after purchasing a Prada bag and Gucci wallet that is. Also, I managed to run a couple of errands here to! There's a large AIS store where I was able to address some issues with my SIM card. I also bought an SD card for my camera and a portable charger for my mobile phone. Generally, the staff were all able to speak English proficiently. Service was good. Overall, Siam Paragon is great for all ages. I hope I've given you enough reasons on why you should check out the mall. And also, if you've a bad craving for Krispy Kreme after backpacking Southeast Asia for weeks, COME HERE all the more!!!"

There's a supermarket on the ground level that is considered a little pricey by Thai standards but it has a good selection of international products. There are a lot of shops and restaurants you can choose from which is expensive from Thai standards but really you're paying prices that are similar to American dollars. The quality great!

Don't forget to eat Italian pizza in the food court and go to the toilet in the M floor.

Located prominently in front of Siam BTS Skytrain station - the interchange of the two BTS lines - it is considered by many to be the centre of Bangkok .The location is always a busy spot for travellers and locals as it's has good transportation connectivity on road and BTS train.The mall is compact in its size and layout and it provides mainly luxury items and cosmetic and high end branded products selling shops and retail outlets for well-heeled Thais and international visitors with cash to splurge. If you are looking for something extra-special then Siam Paragon is definitely the place to find it. I jus went inside the mall and walked around the shops and outlets and made my way out after having some refreshments in the mall..It's definitely not a place for budget travellers...."

I'm not really much for malls, but I'm very impressed by the layout and presentation of the place. America has a lot to learn about building interesting shopping malls. High-end shops at one side of the ground floor (Cartier, Louis Vuitton, etc.), a multi-story department store (if you like watches, check out their ground floor watch department - massive!), high-end automobiles upstairs, a big electronics section in the department store, a section for high-quality Thai-made handicrafts, quite a few restaurants in the basement and upstairs - it just goes on and on. I've visited several times and I know I haven't seen it all. I skipped the top floor entirely, which I believe has movie theaters and other entertainment options.2 thumbs up!"

If you are, however, expecting, to buy nice clothes at low prices, this is not a good place to go. There are definitely premium labels, but I i got the impression that prices are even higher than in many European cities."

There is something for everyone and anything at all price ranges. High end shopping from luxury brands, food courts, movie theaters, auto brands represented, beauty shops and an aquarium for kids and tourists.I was looking for Thai and Asian designers and the men's department had a nice selection at reasonable prices. One of the plusses is they have an amazing food court in the basement to get lunch or refreshments. At one point in the day I even got a Men's facial in one area of the mall where they have health spas and other range of health and beauty departments. Was happy I went there and also to Siam Center across the street!!"

Many food restaurants and vendors plus a huge grocery store. The world is your oyster. The department store is confusing but amazing. Men's floor for example. It's many different shops all Laid out like a regular department store. I needed golf pants. Walked through that area until I found the designer and pair I liked. Then you but from a central cashier. Added vines was the sales lady actually hemmed them by hand in 30 min while I did other shopping!!! This mall is connected to Siam Center and Siam Discovery. If you want local designers and unique finds choose these malls. All are connected to the sky train as its main hub."

The main attractions of this place was firstly \u201cSea Ocean Water Aquarium\u201d which is the largest aquarium in South Asia, I have not seen such a large & beautiful aquarium in my life. It was so eye charming & mesmerizing that I was feeling that I am also one of the part of that aquarium. The second attraction was \u201cThai Art Gallery\u201d which contains the best paintings from different parts of Thailand. And yes The Fuji Thailand Restaurant serves the best Thai I have ever eaten& it has made Thai cuisine as my favorite cuisine."

Firstly all visitors using BTS as their mode of transportation to see Bangkok can not avoid the junction of BTS at Siam Square and Siam Paragon is next to it. Therefore visiting the place few times while they are in town is not unusual. The landmark frontage and the outdoor court became the most frequent photographed sight. The crowded Food Court became a place to try, at least once. The Siam Paragon Complex constantly held events to attract locals as well as tourists. All-in-all the place is always exciting and worth a visit and spend at least an hour in there."

If you like designer brands, pretty much all the big names are represented here, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Jimmy Choo etc. Siam Paragon also has an excellent food court with plenty of options. We visited Happy Beef which has delicious soup based noodles, the pad Thai here is also worth trying! There is also a place for melon ice cream (it's orange) for dessert which is delicious. Recommended! There is also a very nice supermarket next to the food court with lots of Japanese grocery items, we stocked up on our favourite Japanese items here to take back home, prices are reasonable. This place pretty much kept us busy for whole the evening! Definitely worth a visit even for a wander."

I often find myself eating at Greyhound which goes under a modified name now and cannot recall what it is. I generally eat at their Central at Chidlom outlet. On my last visit to Siam Paragon my friend discovered \"Garrett Popcorn\". No wonder there was a long queue, it was super tasty with every mouthful expanding my waistline. Lethal but ever so good.

The cinema lobby is very good and there was a good choice of English movies. The seats were very comfy and with lots of leg space. Interesting we had to rise and stand for the national anthem before the show started. It screened the king when he was young and his contribution to agricultural development in Thailand. I could appreciate the respect to the King."

We took the BTS to Siam see how the Thai people spend their weekend and were not disappointed as the flow of weekend mall traffic was a delightful mix of families strolling girlfriends and couples, foreigners and Thai women that looked like they loathed to share a space with the common people but secretly enjoyed people seeing them in their fur. Fur in the 100 degree Thai heat? What a wonderful way to show you step from AC to AC locales only. I digress. Siam Paragon was the most instagrammed place worldwide in 2013 we are told.Also, Siam as a stop is a must see weekend Bts stop for people watching if you are new to public transit as the volume moving slowly but efficiently is no New York or London or Toronto or any other transit. No one is pushy no one cuts anyone off, it is very Minnesotan.At Siam Paragon we tried to take the elevator straight to the 5th floor where the theater is but it was full multiple times it arrived so we had to escalator our way up. The movie was enjoyable just to see the opulence, chandeliers and all and sit on a couch to see a movie in VIP seating. It was good to snack on popcorn rather than dried squid, Bangkok banana and dried peas as we have been. It is not a cheaper activity. 700-900 baht per person. FYI when the anthem plays at the beginning, stand up and stand still. You'll see this done around you.We also had a sit down meal in the food court which had great lunch specials for reasonable prices (something Pepper near the Dairy Queen). Who would think malls would have good food but we heard something like 50% of Thais prefer to eat out. Perhaps a questionable stat but we saw people eating out everywhere all of the time.There are luxury brands, high end cars on display but more importantly cold AC and a place to get off sore feet for a few hours.Also a Sea Life aquarium on the ground floor, just like the Mall of America.Check out the adorable Cloud Forest the restaurant of the same name had built."

There are other popular stores like Zara and the Emporium dept store if your budget is not so generous. The Kinokuniya book store is a fabulous store where you can lose yourself for a few hours.Hop off at Siam BTS station and Siam Paragon is right there. Easy Peasy.

I have travelled to BKK many times and often gave this mall a miss, in favour of Central World where I usually stay nearer to (that also looked more wallet friendly somewhat). This time round I took some time to really walk around the mall and I am impressed. It is huge with many big brands and had an aquarium within the mall. If shopping for big brands is not really your idea of shopping in bkk (like myself), you should really check out their cinema level which is amazing. Other than that, give their ground floor food level a try. There were range for any type of eaters. Some cafes and bakeries are so fancy you really don't know which one to go for as everything look so yummy. And the thing is, if you have been paranoid of eating street food at bkk's true blue street vendors, there are stalls here selling Thailand's street food at a much better hygiene level -- and not at any more expensive price too. I had this fried banana fritters snacks at 30 Bahts for 8 pieces and a Thai milk tea at about 35 or 40 Bahts. I would say this is heaven if you love food, and especially if you are traveling in a group and can share the food varieties."

It is catered towards high-end fashion, all Chanel, Hermes, LV streaming in your face. So we had a quick snack here before our movies (another post). The way it works here is that they devote an ENTIRE floor or sometimes even two, to just food!! IT'S HEAVEN! Prior to ordering any meal from the counter, you must acquire a reloadable card to use in substitution of money. That's their only acceptable method of payment. The stalls are divided by cuisine and beyond. It's slightly overwhelming at first."

We saw Star Wars at the 5th floor Cineplex. Though a little pricy at about $30USD per ticket, it was in a large screen theater that had huge reclining lounge chairs. It is worth coming early to hang out in the first class lounge where you get a complimentary Starbucks drink and a dessert of some kind.

Amazing light displays outside at its entrance! It has a very classy ambiance and was so beautiful inside! The top floors are mostly high-class fashion brands which is quite typical of 'Paragon' shopping malls all over the globe. It's beautiful, grand and majestic, but you probably wouldn't do your shopping here. It is at the basement level that Siam Paragon truly shines. It has a MASSIVE basement food court, along with a hypermart that allows you to buy your food and have it cooked by chefs inside on the spot! The hypermart sells an array of foods, ranging from seafood to premium beef. There were stations with chefs where the chefs cook up your purchases immediately! It was amazing! Not only so, there was alot of restaurants in the basement level! One of those was the Happy Beef restaurant, where we thoroughly enjoyed their beef noodles! I would be giving a more comprehensive food list/guide in my blogspot where I would be including many photos that I took! Do visit the site by clicking on my bio, where I have provided a link! Overall, this was my best experience in Bangkok! I would suggest taking the BTS or Tuk-tuk to the location as it may not be of walking distance to most nearby hotels (the walking path is rather complicated...)"

The location is super central with tons to do around the mall. I took the BTS Metro to Siam station and there is an entrance to the mall without exiting the station. It's a good place to shop for Western brands or just to have a quick look at where the wealthy people in Bangkok shop and what they buy! I particularly liked the food court at the mall in the lower level. It had several options and was quite unlike anything I have experienced before. You can get all types of food and desserts. I really liked the restaurant named 'Peppery' (warning: food is very spicy but delicious). I would recommend this place for a quick stop to cool down and get a snack."

I remember it was insanely hot and the Siam Paragon, newly built, was the only place I could find that provided shade and was air conditioned throughout. I found the mall in those days a very stale place, many of the units were either empty or waiting to be occupied and there was hardly any customers. It's changed a bit since those days. We visited Siam Paragon on the last day of our trip to Thailand before going to the airport. We found the food, shopping and general ambiance in this mall to be second to none and would stand up to any other high end shopping mall I've been to in Europe or the United States. The cinema on the 5th floor is huge and spectacular, replete with 4D and IMAX screens. Although the supermarket on the ground floor sells only the highest standard of ingredients and food, I found it to be very expensive (even by European standards) and would only appeal to the richer residents of Bangkok.  On the whole, we loved our visit to Siam Paragon and would highly recommend a visit."

A high end mall with top designer brands as you find in most modern capital cities. Not more or less expensive than others I have been to although I must say that I was not really there for shopping. My tip is to use the currency exchange located in a Thai owned jewellery store on the second floor (can't remember the name) rates best I saw in Bangkok and much better than airport, kiosks, banks, etc. They give even better rates for big denomination foreign currency notes. \u20ac100 or \u20ac500 plus $.

As an American who grew up with George Lucas films, I was like a kid in a candy store entering the exhibit which had interactive games and displays of Star Wars characters.We have been here many times over last 10 years and always visit when we are in Bangkok. Be sure to see a movie at the Cineplex, and if your budget allows, buy the VIP seating or a 4-D experience. Just remember that only 1 or 2 movies are in 4D.If you are a foodie, a visit to the Gourmet Market is a must, on the ground floor level. I could easily spend 2-3 hours shopping here.

The Siam Paragon is of course an exclusive assortment of shops, stores and accessories, but for me it was where I had and fell in love with my first sampling on Tom Yum soup. This mix of meat, seafood, veggies, a dumpling and loads of spicy seasoning was such an explosive taste in my mouth, I knew I had to have this special treat again on this visit and future visits. Purchase your food card at the counter that can be used at any of the stations at the food court for that day. My first night in town I headed here and they were sold out of the Tom Yum soup, so I was disappointed and made it a point to head over the next day, earlier of course, and finally had the soup I fell in love with all over again.There is a great selection of other food shops on this floor and I will check out some of these other stores before leaving the country. It\u2019s a can\u2019t miss spot when touring around the city. All of the trendy youth also hang out here with their friends. The Christmas decorations are very nice and during Dec/Jan there is a special exhibit outside near the fountains of various decorated model elephants.FYI: The rabbit transit card also works here and you receive a 10% discount off each transaction."

Great staff and smiley manager. The Japanese chef comes out to greet guests too.) Shops you should never visit: 1) Nippon Kai (basement level) - bad food, expensive prices and unhappy non-English speaking staff who are not interested in the customers. Worst restaurant of my Bangkok trip. We left hungry, dissatisfied, angry and frustrated at being ignored. Staff made us feel like we were a burden and it was a chore to serve us.

Malls are NEVER in my itinerary. It was a Sunday and I was walking around a relatively quiet Bangkok when I remembered I left my DSLR Macro Lens at home (I'm a photographer). I figured the next best thing was to find an attachable lens for my iPhone. I googled Apple stores in Thailand hoping to find something such as an Olloclip but to no available. However, under Apple's website listed authorized retail stores in Thailand under names such as iStore at the Siam Paragaon Mall (Asians are obsessed with knockoff apple names i.e. iCafe). Great... here we go.I waved down a Tuk Tuk from TKS road to Siam Paragon for 200THB (might be able to bargain less). As I arrived, I found out that all the locals hang out at the mall. Why? AIR CONDITIONING. Ok maybe it was also because it this beautiful mall carried amazing brands.I ended walking to 3-4 amazing electronic stores (iStore didn't have it), found my lens in a department store, and proceeded to window shop. Some of these stores carried accessories and brands I was only able to order online in the States (i.e. Element iPhone cases). Next thing you know I've ordered a latte at Au Bon Pain and started doing some writing at Starbucks for the next few hours.I must say I was pretty impressed. A good stop if you're in the mood for shopping or need to pick up some electronics."

There is a lot of different choices for food, and it is relatively well priced depending on where you choose to eat at. There are also a lot of stores, some of which get a ways expensive. It's one of the better malls for window shopping and just chilling around with friends and family."

This new shopping mall is easy to reach by BTS skytrain (drop off at Siam Station). At Siam Paragon, you can enjoy shopping at brand name shop such as Dolce and Gabbana, Prada or Gucci. The price is average if compare to popular shopping mall such as in Hong Kong or Empirium (I am prefer Emporium but Paragon is better for food court). Anyway, the best use of Paragon is meeting point at the fountain. And also the event at space between Paragon and Siam Center."

There is even a series of high-end new car showrooms on one of the floors with brands such as Ferrari, Rolls Royce and Porsche, among others.The food court on the ground floor is amazing! The food is great and our family thought the prices were good. The prices are not as good as you can get on the street or some other places - however, compared to Aussie prices they are great. There's also an awesome supermarket and all sorts of yummy food and dessert choices here. Include this place in your list of places to visit."

The Gourmet food market has top quality fish and meat - and again great variety.English is widely spoken.The food court is expensive by local standards with a mains at 60 to 200 baht - but excellent quality, good value and packed with eaters. Recommend the 5 spice duck in soup with angle hiar noodles! 80 baht.It is also the only malll i know where the ladies can go and check out all the clothes, handbags and cosmetics, while the guys browse the Ferrari, Lambo, Maserati, Lotus, Porche, Rolls Royce and Aston Martins in the in store outlets....

Siam Paragon, however, and in most instances suits my temperament, because I can find mostly everything I want in this mall.There is an excellent supermarket which caters to gourmet as well as normal European or American requirements. There are lots of restaurants. Most international cuisines are represented. The mall caters mostly to ladies, and apparently does so quite well, since the lady shoppers seem to be mostly in high spirits, probably because every top brand, of clothes, jewelry, cosmetics etc appear to be represented here. If there is any change left over from shopping, they can pick up a Ferrari, Lamborgini or Porche as they are parked on display in the aisles. The mall has movie theaters on the top floors, they feature all the latest western moving in English with Thai subtitles. My only gripe is that I occasionally get lost whilst trying to find something. Most of the shop staff don't speak English and those that do, appear to have no idea where anything is in the mall, other than their own shop. This can become quite frustrating, as I sometimes wander around lost, just like a mouse in a maze looking for a specific item.The mall exits to the BTS skytrain which is very convenient, that is, if you can get anyone to direct you to the Skytrain exits. It would be very helpful if the mall were signposted a bit better."

Due to its location that accessible from BTS \"Siam Station\" and a lot of goos shops and restaurants, this mall is all-the-time crowded. However it is worth to go, especially the gourmet market on G floor. Apart from shopping for groceries, the market has a section called \"you hunt we cook\" where you can buy meat (beef, fish, pork, and ect.) from the market and get your meat cooked and you can eat inside the market. You can also buy drinks and other items. I just tried dry aged beef of a Thai producer called \"Company B\". I chose a 300 grams of sirloin (THB 380). Cooking fee is THB 100. You can pick sauce and side dish with THB 60 per selection."

There are indeed luxury boutiques, (easily recognisable even if you are not into brands as the items displayed in their windows will not have any price tags) but you will also find branches of Gap, Boots, H&M and Uniqlo, to name a few, all of which have the advantage of being much quieter than their Central World counterparts, the reason being, I suspect, that most tourists do not know they are there. Orientation can be tricky in Siam Paragon and it is easy to get lost in the different wings, particularly since their signs are not always up to date, adding to the confusion. It can therefore be a hassle to find the shop you are looking for. But once you have a mental map of the mall it is actually a very pleasant place to shop for clothing, food and anything else, under the same roof. It will not the cheapest option (but this is central Bangkok) but it is a good option for mid-range shopping within immediate reach of the BTS. If you are after something to eat, restaurants, snacks & cafes are on all levels and worth discovering as often very quiet in the morning too but the main food area in on the basement. it includes numerous restaurants, stalls selling savoury and sweet food, a food hall and a large Gourmet Market branch with a very good pet department, affordable and well supplied (you would have to go all the way to Chatuchak to find the brands they stock). If you want to take away your meal, the grilled meat skewers outside Gourmet Market are cheap and delicious, a bit further up, still along the supermarket you will find authentic Chinese cakes and a bit further up again yummy custard. The delicious Japanese Hokkaido soft serve ice-cream can also be found there. All in all, a mall worth discovering, even if it takes some time to do so!"

We had just gotten into thailand and did not want to do anything too strenuous right away, so we thought we would check out the mall, since we had heard so much about the malls in Bangkok. We were interested in going to the movies, because one of our travel books recommended it. It said that the movie theaters can be quite luxurious, and that, before the movie starts, there is an homage that is paid to the king, which can be a bit of a cultural experience. We did not end up having enough time to watch the movie we wanted to see, and so ended up walking around the mall instead. It wasn't for us. I would suggest figuring out how long it will take to get there in advance if you are on a tight time table; we learned that Bangkok rush hour can be from 7am-10am, and 4pm-9/10pm, which would explain why it took so long to get there from our hotel."

The area is very big and the meeting hall can accommodate at least 1200 seating (theatre style) for business conference. However, holding the event earlier than the official shopping mall opening at 10 am is an issue. The delegates and sponsors representatives had to figure out the right back entrance ( along the car park and further from staff entrance ) to go direct to the conference and exhibition area. The best advantage: it is a good location as it is nearest to siam station by BTS. "

Most of the stores are name brands with outrageous price tags. There are a few normal shops left, look in the back of the center. The department store in the center of the complex offers a wide range of products. Recently they went though a change where many of the better restaurants were asked to leave. Now the selection of food has gone down, while the prices have gone up. There are lots of dessert places though."

The Mall is great, it has all the major brands in the world, the shops create great window displays, and of course that offer the usual VAT certificate for visitors. In the past l have visited mid week and learnt to visit early as when schools finish the Mall is mobbed by schoolchildren, it is worth a visit but do not expect to find items cheaper here, in fact some of the items are more expensive that mainland Europe, so 'do your homework before buying\""

Siam Paragon is connected to Siam Center and Discovery Center (n a [temporarily closed] skybridge connects to MBK, MahBoonKrong mall, the grand-daddy of Bangkok malls). On the other side of the Siam BTS station is teen-trendy Siam Square n another new mall.One could spend a whole week in this area. But Paragon alone is so huge, most visitors don't get to appreciate all food & shopping options. Beyond the endless boutiques, go up to the 3rd floor to oggle at the Rolls-Royce showroom, or spend half a day at the fantastic aquarium in the basement. Don't miss the feeding times at the main tank. Very therapeutic, watching the fishes. Food, glorious food. Paragon supermarket is amazing, with a wide selection of imported foods, cooked food, n fresh fruits.For dining options, Fuji serves fresh, good Japanese food at super prices. MK Gold serves very good Chinese food and dim sum. Ka-Nom counter near the supermarket has the best Macau egg tarts, outside of Macau (pricey at baht 45, but well worth it). A-Not-Her Hound cafe (part of Greyhound group) on the first floor serves excellent Thai-Western \"fusion\" cafe fare (try the wings). See and be seen.The best Japanese buffet IN THE WORLD is at Paragon's Oishi Grand (reservations a must), pricey (almost baht 2,000) but worth every penny. Freshest quality, widest selection of Japanese food. Where else can U find (super expensive) \"snow fish\" at a buffet, cooked to your preference?Leave some space for the matcha (green tea) ice cream."

You should also try Lacerise\u2019s macarons, they tasted really good and it\u2019s not very expensive.

If you use the BTS you don\u2019t need to find a place to park, because the BTS is in front of the Paragon. In Siam Paragon there are many interesting shops, for example they have almost every bag brand, perfume, fashion venue, Lifestyle and Leisure, I.T. World\u2019 and more restaurants. At the Siam Paragon also have a VIP Cinema Experience and IMAX Theater too.The design of Siam Paragon is very beautiful, inside the Paragon there is a place that was very beautiful that we can take a picture.

It took us close to a day to get around, but was worth it if you have time to kill and wish to escape the heat. The shopping is also pretty good, the H&M was really worth it.

We also tried the red juice ( too sweet) and the new discovery Pandan juice ( preferred taste). We went to the nearby grocery filled to the brim with fresh cherries, apples, pears, mangoes, oranges, etc. and bought apples, soda, milk, strawberry jam and bread for a quick fix in the middle of the night.

Nothing special in the food court, but the special events nearby have specialty foods from all over. Normally there will be something worthy to try. It changes every 12 days. Then above that is shopping and more shopping. At the extreme end there is a jewelry shop with an foreign currency exchange facility, it has always offered the best rates in Thailand. I think it is on the 3rd floor.Then on top are the cinemas with imax.Generally worth a visit."

What separates them are the customers and food courts as well as the size of the stores. Paragon has fancy high so clients from Thailand and abroad but also tons of tourists and on some days its just a hassle to try and shop there. For pretty much the same Thai customers and much less foreigners, go to Emporium which is a few stops down the Sukhumvit BTS. A great place to be looking for a sugar mama or daddy. The food court however is amazing and also the supermarket is awesome.Ah by the way, they also have an amazing cinema, 4D cinema upstairs (but also very expensive, you get the same size and quality cinema in lower priced malls) and also a huge seaworld downstairs."

This is a highish end mall although unlike Gaysorn or Central Embassy which are stunning malls with very high end retailers; Siam Paragon actually has shoppers!Siam Paragon flows into Siam Centre and it flows into the now closed for renovation Siam Discovery which is opposite the famous MBK Centre wehich is more like an internal market than a shopping Centre in the Siam mould.Siam Paragon has the best food court I have seen and it is a sprawling and tasty array of different and varied retailers buzzing all the time in this popular basement with brilliant access from the street, shopping centre and importantly from the BTS skytrain.The newly opened Emquartier will challenge this on a higher end level yet the accessibility to all people that Siam has will endure."

But for most the ultimate \"window shopping experience\"-whether looking at the most luxurious bags or Swiss watches or perfumes or even the fanciest cars. Brilliant setting, excellent to hang out and for those who love to photograph themselves. Connected with Siam Square, Central World. Fantastic supermarket on the ground floor, and well priced food court serving a variety of cuisines. Sealife Bangkok is on the bottom floor. So the day you visit this, you can keep hanging out in Siam Paragon on your agenda."

You definitely need more than 3 hours here :)- Big and spacious. Love the clean and classy look as well. Makes shopping comfortable, although branded goods in Bangkok is more expensive vs Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.- I love the restaurants and food choices here. So many to choose from. I recommend Kalpapruek Restaurant for delicious Thai food. Love the roti with chicken/pork curry, roti with fried chicken, fried rice with yellow curry pork and tom kha kai. Also visit Laem Cha-Roen Seafood! High recommended. Delicious food and reasonably price. - Dessert place is ample \u2013 so many selection from Western to local. Try Coffee Bean by Dao for delicious cakes!- Kinokuniya book shop \u2013 one of the biggest book shop that I have ever been to. Books are slightly cheaper here and they offer free wrapping service :)- Entertainment \u2013 big cinema and bowling alley if you are interested. They even have an aquarium and wax museum :)Be prepared to spend a day here.

Great if you need anything from a new screaming red Ferrari or jet black Rolls Royce to endless high end designer cloths and cosmetics. Appears that all items here are authentic and you will pay dearly for them but still a great way to kill many hours in a very nice environment. Activities include watching the super rich tourists buy cars and watches while grabbing a bite to eat in one of the many restaurants including western style fast food to 4 star dinning establishments and catching one of the many free events that are sponsored here. Of course the surrounding area is also jamb packed with many sights to see along with other similar shopping opportunities so plan on spending the day!"

There is a great Aquarium in the basement of the shopping centre, but is quite pricey. The food court is absolutely huge. Shoe stores are in abundance, clothes stores even more so. If you're looking for any luxury brand, this would be the place to get it.Tip: I'd avoid going after 4pm as it can get flooded with kids from school. Best to go in the mornings."

The food halls and fast food outlets were bursting at their seams with locals and tourists alike. Found my \"oasis\" at the Laduree Boutique/Cafe which marked my virgin luxury cafe experience. Pros: Compared with its huge neighbour Central World, Siam Paragon is way easier to go around. Even a person with a poor sense of direction like me finished exploring the entire mall on my own. I was awed by the sights of car showrooms and also a beautiful jellyfish backdrop while going down one of the escalators :) Not to forget how convenient it is to take the BTS and also going over Siam Center and Siam Square. Don't forget to drop by the Paragon Department Store as they offer 10% discount for tourists.Area of improvement: Tried to take a touristy selfie with the Siam Paragon as the backdrop at night. Unfortunately the logo does not have its lighting."

As an American, it was fascinating to see the interest that Thais have with some aspects of Western culture, such as a Harrod's tea shopWhere you can have scones, tea, cucumber sandwiches etc... There are giant bears outside of the shop, like the ones in Hartod's London. For me, this was a mall to observe, since the store like Gucci, Chanel, Versace etc... Are too rich for my blood. After visiting more reasonable malls in Bangkok, I don't think I would return tobSiam Paragon again. I can see those kind of malls everywhere in the world. They don't seem to special."

Clean and nice place to shop. everything has their sections, i.e. food, perfume dispensers / air fresheners, etc. some good high end stores but not exclusive high end like Central Embassy mall has which is 10 minutes away via \"skytrain.\"there is a very large grocery store on the first floor. massive food place. lots of coffee, bakery and ice-cream places. starbucks also on the first floor. getting a taxi from here at late evening may be difficult. if i may suggest, take a walk to \"Siam Kempinski\" hotel that is linked via a small bridge from the mall and go to the front of the hotel and get a taxi. make sure that you either have the taxi start the meter right away before you take off from the Siam Kempinski or have a set price before you jump in. Taxi drivers are super weird and lot of them are super scary. take a picture of the taxi license plate or write it down and make sure that the taxi driver's information is on the passenger side dashboard. the driver should have his first and last name, picture and driver's assigned number. if you don't have that, it's not a real taxi driver. if you want real high end shopping only, go to central embassy. Central embassy also has currency exchange bank on the third floor (above Prada)."

This mall is one of the more expensive malls to shop in, which has approx. 8 floors of designer boutiques such as Guest, Coach, etc. etc. Also has a floor of electronics which is interesting to browse. There is also a floor for sale of VERY expensive motor vehicles such as Rolls Royce, BMW and more designer vehicles, some of which I have never heard of, but excellent looking for a few million Thai Baht. This mall is clean and easy to get around. Where ever I looked, the prices are expensive everywhere but there are sales usually throughout the months where if you look you can find a good bargain on an expensive watch, handbags, wallets, clothing and the like. This is not MBK style, more Hollywood Rodeo Drive type of shopping. So your credit card is going to take a hit!"

We've decided not to spend on macaron since we are afraid that 1 is not enough to sooth our craving.Let's get back to the main agenda.... Yes our main agenda was to visit Naraya flagship store. We came twice on the 2nd night and the next day morning before went back home. We bought so many NaRaYa product and I really love the NaRa by NaRaYa range. NaRa by NaRaYa is the premium product that catched our eyes immediately when we walked into the shop.I guess every visit to Thailand will not complete without getting ourselves some NaRaYa product. On our 2nd visit to Siam Paragon in the morning the day that came back to Malaysia, we had our lunch at the food court. HM tried their local cuisine and due to limitation, I only ate calamari ring with fries (seafood based). Lots of tawakal for me since no other option available unless I wanted to starve myself. I also bought my favourite cinamon rolls and I found the price is expensive compared to the one in Kuala Lumpur. Siam Paragon has a huge H&M and branded outlets like Burberry (coming soon), MNG, Superdry etc. We didn't manage to visit other shops than NaRaYa though they have Pasaya there.Maybe our next trip to Bangkok we should concentrate to the malls which is fun but we need to bring lots of cash to enyertain our shopping desire."

            "review": "Be Aware of Scammers!!. First incident happened few years ago. I was shopping at the Paragon Department Store and had decided to buy 3 items at one of its stores. The sale attendant asked me how I would like to pay for the items. I told him by cash. He then showed me the total amount I needed to pay, minus discount, for the total of 3 items using a calculator. I checked the amount which was correct. I gave him the cash. He then went to the cashier counter for the change and the final invoice. When he was back, he handed me the invoice and the correct amount of change. But when I checked the invoice, something was wrong. It only showed 2 items being charged...1 item was missing. Since I could get my VAT refunded, I told him to correct the invoice. He seemed a bit upset when I told him to do so. For this incident, I can't say for sure if the sales attendant made a mistake or he tried to pocket the money for the missing item. But, as for me, a Big Red Flag was raised!!Second incident happened just a month ago. This time it happened to my husband at the same place. He would like to buy a pair of shoes at the shoes department. He checked out the price of the shoes on display and found out there was a 10% off sticker next to the price on the bottom of the shoes. He handed that particular shoe to a sales attendant and asked him to get the right size for him. The sales attendant walked away a few steps, turned around, with his back side facing my husband and used his finger to remove the sticker. Luckily, my husband saw everything. At that moment, my husband didn't say a word. He went back to the display counter and checked out if all the same brand name shoes had the same 10% off sticker. He found out every one of them had it. When the sales attendant came back, my husband tried out the shoes and asked him if there was any discount for it. The sales attendant told him he could get a 5% tourist discount. Right away, my husband confronted him, told him he saw his dishonest action and showed him the 10% off stickers on all the other shoes. The sales attendant still stood his ground and insisted that 5% was right. My husband left immediately. At the end, he still got the same pair of shoes at the Central Department Store Chidlom with 20% off discount. However, if my husband couldn't have seen his action and bought the shoes with cash at Paragon, the dishonest salesman could have pocketed the extra 5%.By chance, both cases happened at the Paragon Department Store. But they could have happened at any place in Bangkok. Tourists and foreigners are huge targets for scammers. Be very careful when you shop."

Siam Paragon is just one of a mass of shopping centers in the Siam area of Bangkok but Paragon is probably the biggest and the most luxurious,If this is your first visit (and you have children) you will want to visit the Sea world center style aquarium in the basement. and on the ground floor is a food center with more restaurants than I have ever seen in one place, there are all the usual McDonald, Starbucks, KFC, Ice cream parlors etc etc but if you walk further you will find there are many other establishments including Italian, Japanese, patisseries and tea houses.On the next floor there is an array of designer shops and top name high street brands and these are interspersed with coffee shops banks etc going higher you will find exclusive car showrooms and all types of technology furniture etc etc.Access to Paragon is very simple there is a walkway direct from the sky train and all taxi drivers know this though if the traffic is bad it is not a good choice, you can also walk via an elevated walkway at least some of the way form many other centers including MBK and Central."

All these three are good enough reasons for you to make your way to Siam Paragon, whether to relax, buy snacks and souvenirs, or have a taste of local Thai food.

Also visit the sporting goods store which is hidden away near the top. Prices are much the same as the West, although I was laden with clothes by the time we left. Staff range from very helpful in the Paragon Department Store to contemptuous at worst or oblivious at best in the designer stores, despite going to these shops to purchase goods the attitude annoyed the girlfriend so much she decided to buy elsewhere. There is a very large food area with a huge selection of food types, we ate in Fuji, not much for me (vegetarian) so I settled for a beer (shame).

Continue shopping or just people-watching, the Bangkok residents never look the same, always wearing their trends with attitude and self esteem. Not like here in Sweden where it feels like everyone is more or less dressed in Acne or HM. Have lunch in the mall and ask yourselves what country you would like to travel to for lunch? In the evening we buy tickets to a movie and of course we choose the VIP-package with drinks and snacks, lounging before the film with our friends and then when the film starts we share the room only with 8 other people while laying down in big comfy seats with pillows and a blanket.

Basically in this area you are within walking distance of a whole sub-city of malls that has few equals in the world for sheer abundance. Of course not everyone likes malls.

We got on to the taxi and the diver immediately told us that there was accident on the way to our hotel and no meter would be used. He insisted to charge us for 450 baht. As we have got 2 young kids with us, we dared not argue with him. We end up paying him 350 baht. I could spot that it was almost the same route as before. So, no matter where you take the taxi, make sure the meter is on before you get on. Go to other hotel to get a taxi if dont want to be charged more.

There were many baby cockroaches running all over one of their drink stalls on top of their coffee machine but when my husband pointed this out to the ladies in attendant, they were pretty nonchalant about it.One thing we notice is that baby cockroaches seem to be ubiquitous in most places in bangkok."

But the restaurant selection might be better in Terminal 21. Eating places at the ground floor is quite congested, one feels like we are eating in an open market. The Thai souvenir section also has the best collection in town. Extremely convenient access from BTS.

So just for the heck of it it's worth the visit. My wife & daughter were able to buy a few stuff. Guess they found some sale items as it has a department store with items/products ranging from clothes, shoes and bags and jewelry. Some other malls or shopping places near Paragon are Platinum Mall (wholesale), MBK (mostly gadgets) & Siam Square. To maximize your shopping experience in these malls you need at least a day since the malls are really big with an endless array of goods and products."

It is a very huge, fantastically illuminated mall, ion what appeared to me as a 7-storey structure. This mall is located right outside the Siam Station, which is the main station for metro travel, a junction of sorts for 2 seperate lines of Metro. If you have been to Mumbai, this station is just like Dadar, how it connects the Central & Western lines. Now because the Metro Stations are internally connected to the Shopping Malls, be it Siam Paragon or MBK or Emporium, it has become extremely easy for shoppers to tour the place, rather than going through the ordeal of getting out of the station, crossing busy roads and then going inside the malls etc... Something that can be implemented in India !On reaching inside, I was actually taken aback for it's huge size, first thing. Thereafter I noticed the hundreds of brands that probably I haven't seen in India. Okay sorry, may be I wasn't particularly into this brand & stuff like that in India, and now since I came to a different town, I was trying to be more attentive :)Secondly, I realized that just like in India, there are designated spaces allocated for seperate brands (or Companies, say Vermoda), just like the shops. But other than that, there are 1-2 floors marked wherein there are no shop-like separate structures. Different companies just display their products in the open (on hooks or hangers) for viewers to see, try and take. So, my curiosity led me to talk to the Supervisor there and very casually, he confided in me that this is a great way to save space, accommodate more brands & earn rental revenue. It also helps in pack & unpack, without closing the doors of the shops and keeping 10 security guards. Products are on the costlier side but good to go atleast once. The food court is on the ground floor itself and is pretty big with a lot of Thai food items to eat. Else, there is McDonalds as well. Cheers !"

Remember to put last order in food outlets before 9PM for dinner.\"Boots\" is a quality outlet for quality medicines and cosmetics. On the same floor of gourmet shop, you will find \"Boots\" outlet but I will suggest not to visit \"Boots\" outlet of this Siam Paragon. Reasons are:1. I should say this outlet of \"Boots\" is not a tourist friendly. I visited twice this outlet at the end of December 2014, staffs are not so willing to work. Not friendly. 2. Most of the \"Boots\" around Bangkok (approximately at all shopping malls has \"Boots\" outlet) offer \"vat refund for tourist\" for purchase of equal or more than 2000 baht but they don't.I found helpful staff of \"Boots\" at the Big-C opposite of central world/Isetan or Gateway shopping mall at BTS Ekkamai."

Yes there are the complete repertoire of high end designer shops along with Rolls Royce, Bentley, Maserati and Ducati showrooms which are interesting to peruse. The fun of Paragon is the extensive lower level food court and Gourmet Market where you can eat, sample and buy an enormous range of gustatory delights then vista the sea life exhibit if you are with children or still enjoy such experiences yourself. I find it an excellent resource to see what the current state of the \"Best of the Best' is in retail products, electronics, toiletries and handicrafts. Ifs easily accessed via the Siam BTS station. Its huge, especially when taken with everything that it interconnects with such as SIam, Central, etc. Worth checking out if only for the food court."

            "review": "This mall has grown on me!. I didn't like this mall when it first opened. 80% of items sold could be found at other malls with better discount. Typically Siam Paragon would offer 10% whereas Central and others would be 15%. However, it has grown on me. Rack prices are still high but if you know what you are looking for and are prepared to shop around and/or have the time to wait then bargains can be had.High end fashion from well known brand names e.g Burberry,Gucci , LV etc will very rarely be competitive with the US or UK/Europe so not a lot of bargains to be had on these lines. I suspect these brands sell to wealthy Thais who can't wait for their next trip to Europe and must have the latest model now, this instant.The same can be said for luxury watches but the dealers are often willing to give you a significant discount. I just got a 35% discount on an exclusive Swiss brand watch. Admittedly, this discount brought the price down to the same as you could buy online in the USA but I got to see the watch and the shop and the warranty/box etc so there was much less risk. The discounts are there. Do not be put off by the price tag, especially for watches. If you are prepared to negotiate in Paragon there are some good deals to be had.I also agree with a previous poster. Anyone spending time in Bkk who fancies a trip to the movies should buy a 1st Class Cinema Ticket at either Paragon or Central World. This kind of experience is not readily available in the UK/Europe and if it is it would be 2-3 times the price that you pay in Bangkok. I recommended this to some young Kazakh friends of mine. They were unsure whether to spend the extra (it was 700bt a ticket at the time compared to 150bt for a normal seat) but they took the plunge and they were glad they did. It was just a nice way to experience a movie - an experience that may not even be available in your home country."

We ate instead at a much quieter, and more expensive, Chinese restaurant on the 4th floor where I had one of the best sweet and sour fish dishes I have tasted. The dessert menu dd not appeal so we went back down to the ground floor too one of the icecream parlours and ordered a wicked banana split with stawberries and other fruit, ice cream and cream. It was served with two small jugs one with strawberry topping and one with chocolate topping. After that I am ashamed to say that we went on to another coffee bar for a satisfying cappochino to finish the repast."

Best rice crispy I've eaten. Fresh.  5. Food court - where the mango for mango rice is only cut when you buy. Not earlier. The skin of Vietnam spring roll is made fresh and on the spot. So is the Tom yum soup - which means that the queue for these stalls take longer. Get a fully refundable food card at the main entrance to purchase food. 6. Food mart is amazingly huge with rows of Perrier, Evian, San Pellegrino. Chacuterie. High end living. I was told there's a BMW showroom on the top floors. No idea."

Don't forget to step into the supermarket because you don't know what you see, that much and even more food. Don't forget to watch a movie in the Siam Paragon movie theatre. It's like sitting at home with a lot of space for your feet and the sound is the best in the world. All the great designers in clothes are there. My favourite brand M.A.C. make-up. There are stores for massages, put on eye-lashes, even a new shape eyebrow like in Oprah Winfrey. Down in the cellar there is a huge place to see everything that swims in the see. Really beautiful. A must see. From shark to clownfish. You also can swim with the sharks. If I stay 12 days in Bangkok you can see mee about 10 days for a few hours in the Siam Paragon :) It makes you happy even if you don't have enough money to buy everyting!!

However, its still fun to just window shop in well-appointed and relaxing environs. More importantly to me, Siam Paragon has an absolutely great mish-mash of food outlets, concentrated mainly on what they call the ground floor. Something for everyone, something for every appetite. The main western joints are well represented (Macs, Crispy Cr\u00e8me, etc). But they also have many small stalls scattered around selling local or local inspired food. There is a food court too with good variety. For Muslim travellers, one stall is halal certified (think its called Eusoff) and it serves excellent chicken based dishes. The murtabak and satay is different from what I'm used too back home but delicious nonetheless. Just in front of the supermarket on the same floor, there are many desert counters selling lovely sweets. Speaking of the supermarket, the one here is a big one with lots of items sold that may not be stocked in other supermarts in nearby malls. For example, we were looking for a small bottle version of a powder we like; could only find it here. The mall is also very well connected. By that I mean two things. Firstly, its easy to get to as its directly connected to BTS Siam Station. Secondly, its a great hop off point to a large number of malls. For example, if you walk to the connected Siam Discovery Mall and continue walking in the same direction, a series of overhead bridge connections will take you through a few malls all the way to MBK Centre; without you ever stepping onto the street. In the other direction, leave the mall via the back entrance facing Siam Kempinski, hang a right, walk past the carpark and the small roadside food stalls and in less than five minutes you at Central World. And Central Worlds is of course only five minutes walk along the road to the popular Platinum Fashion Mall in the Pratunam district. So start and end your day at Siam Paragon and explore the rest of Bangkok's wonderful world of mall shopping in between. Lovely."

So they missed out on a sale due to the fact I was going to buy some ear buds for my phone and I wanted to buy some bluetooth speakers. But no one served me! So I walked out! Non of the staff came to me asking if I needed some help. Amazing! Don't they want any sales???"

I decided to write a review of all the Siam Malls in Bangkok since they are all connected to one another and the shopping and dining experience of all were fantastic. The complex is easily accessible by BTS but we walked a short 15 minutes from our hotel, The Renaissance, through the overhead BTS bridge. The shopping is diverse from all the Westernized (Marc Jacobs, Victoria's Secret, Sephora, Au Bon Pain, etc.) and European designer establishments (LV, Furla, Bvlgari, H & M, Topshop, La Duree, Harrod's Tea Room, etc.) to the local boutique and handicraft stores. There is a huge cinema complex at Siam Paragon and the Gourmet Market (supermarket) is one of a kind. Much better than any of the premier markets that I have been to in Europe, Asia or the US. The food court is massive, all cuisine imaginable being served to anyone's particular palate. The malls offer tourist discounts at certain stores so bring your passport (actually I just showed them a copy on my phone which sufficed). They have their own department store, Paragon, equivalent to any middle-high priced department store in other countries and they were having a huge sale when we visited. Since we love shopping, this was a shopper's heaven."

It is in the middle of everything and is huge enough for pretty much anything that you need.Ignoring the big branded stores (you'll find the usual big international brands), you can even find car showrooms to entertain the men.For a more local flavor, The basement supermarket is great to roam. Lots of local taste and produce, get stocked up with your favorite thai seasonings and spices. Prices may not be as cheap as on the streets but the variety and quality is definitely better.Within the paragon department store, if you go up to the top floor, they have a whole section on thai scents and local artisans. This is great if you love aromatic oils, diffusers, etc. some of the brands are very high end where you find them in luxury spas and hotels around the world.Plus: paragon gives a tour yet discount of 5%, and they also have easy tax refund counters on almost every floor.

Furthermore, if you carry heavy items and many shopping bags, the Security Guards will assist to open the taxi door as well as carry your items into the taxi. Not to mentioned the Security Guard will thank you for coming with the Thai greetings. Where else can you get this amazing service. I guess that is why they called Amazing Thailand.

So what made our trip really memorable is the Ocean World housed in the mall where we had a fantastic time. The Madam Tussaud was another attraction and we closed off the tour with a miniature Porsche model from the car show room in the mall. That made my son's day !"

My main reason for going here whenever I am in Bangkok is to visit Kinokuniya as I am a bibliophile and this outlet is the best in Thailand (they have a smaller store in Emporium). I can happily browse the shelves, but I always carry a list of wants and the staff are superb. I give them my list, they check the computer and then happily go off and collect up my books for me... all with a happy smile. Also, if we are with our grandchildren we are dragged into Underwater World for yet the umpteenth time (I sure I should have a season ticket) and then up to the cinema again. There is a great food court with a wide variety of foods available and the food hall is one of the best there is. If you are an automobile fan there are showrooms for a vast range of makes including some of the more exotic ones. Practically every name in fashion and design is present here as well. Lose yourself for a day here and dream."

I asked about shopping at the airport and they pointed me in the area of Siam where the Paragon, Siam Centre is and MBK is nearby. I got off the BTS at Siam after the interchange at Phaya Thai from the airport and proceeded to walk around the Siam Paragon. When walking around my jaw was dragging along the floor for most of time as I saw a TV show being filmed there, found there were 3 floors to this thing which I didn't manage to explore. There was an aquarium, cinema and to my amazement in the middle of it all was an area of car showrooms on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Most of the shops in there were high end shops like Adidas, and several other branded shops. It is a great place to stay cool and you have to experience the food court on the lower floors. All in all it is a great place, but slightly expensive for my budget travelling as a backpacker. Killed some time though."

It has the branded stuff there, like LV, Cartier, Armani, and etc. But you will not feel that this is the place for the rich and famous only, as they have other brands in them that do not burn a hole in your pocket. Mainly lifestyle items, from ladies boutiques, men boutiques, cafes and many others. They even have an entire floor (Level 4 if didnt remember wrongly) catered to the electronic items, gadgets and its peripherals. They also have a huge commercial gym there too.They also have on the basement 1 level, an entire level specially dedicated to F&B. So you have tons of options to choose from should you feel hungry for a meal or just seat down for a drink.At Basement 2 level, it is an entire level dedicated to a marine/ocean themed exhibition, like some sort of ocean aquarium. My family and I didn't go in, so can't share much about that. The place is huge, if it is the first time there, you may feel a little lost. You just need to get your bearings right, then you are pretty safe. It is also right next to the BTS Station. And beside it there is another 2-3 shopping malls that are connected with sheltered walkways. In fact, it is also near to the famous MBK Centre. Though it seems to be about 1 BTS Station away, you can actually walked from one to the other, 95% sheltered.So in fact you can just spend 2 full days or so just to shop among all the shopping centres.Definitely a shopping haven in this area."

While it is known for high end authentic brand name shops, it offers plenty for people of all budgets, nationalities and age groups. Families with children can find plenty to do here. On the ground level there is Siam Ocean World which is a very famous aquarium with plenty to look at and some additional activities available too. There is also a 5D theatre right next to it. On the fifth floor is Kidzania. This is for age groups 4-15 years old. It allows kids to roll play in various dream jobs such as working as a dentist, staffing a Boeing-777, saving a building from fire with real water and so much more. There are 80 different jobs and is something for all ages 4 and up to be seen here. The mall also has a Game Zone arcade too.Food is another main attraction of Siam Paragon. On the bottom level the food court called Food Hall which uses a coupon system is excellent. Here you load up a prepaid card that can be used for purchases. When finished you take the card back to redeem the remainder for cash. Vegans and vegetarians take note that Food Hall has excellent Vegan food with 10-15 different dishes to choose from. It however is mostly mock-meat dishes and looks so authentic, you probably will be forced to ask the staff to confirm it is all vegetarian, and yes it not only is it vegetarian but it is all vegan friendly too. Just look for the sign that says vegetarian. That is one particular stand of Food Hall. Meat eaters will find tons of options here too.There is of course much more than just the food hall. All your international fast food chains can be found here such as Starbucks, McDonald's, KFC, H\u00e4agen-Dazs, Swensen's Ice Cream, Fuji Japanese etc. There are other delicious shops for Italian, Thai food, is a Fish Caf\u00e9 branch which is one of the most popular Fish and Chips chains in the area and so much more. If you like higher end dining this can be found here too for most all tastes. Thai, Italian, Japanese, Indian food, you name it and you\u2019ll find it here.As for the shopping, featured is authentic shops of the major high-end brand names Gucci, Versace, Louis Vuitton, Giorgio Armani, Coach, Bvlgari, Fendi, Jimmy Choo and literally dozens more.You can even purchase a luxury car right at Siam Paragon. There are showrooms that include Lamborghini, Bentley, Porsche, Jaguar, BMW and other high end vehicles.Despite all the luxury, there is still plenty of shopping for those with mortal incomes, with local stores selling a mix of generic and brand name clothing and other merchandise.All in all, when traveling to Bangkok basing yourself as close to Siam Paragon as possible is very ideal. This is right across from Siam Discovery Zone which has other attractions including Madame Tussauds wax museum. It is also in walking distance to Central World which has additional shopping and food opportunities and other things for children such as coin operated rides, an arcade and a play section with slides. In the other direction it is a fairly easy walk to Platinum Fashion Mall too. Outside shopping can be found right in the area here called Siam Square too. There is a BTS right here, so it is easy to get around other areas of Bangkok and this is also one of the easier places to grab a taxi too.The hotels I\u2019ve stayed at that are in walking distance to Siam Paragon include Novotel on Siam Square, Centara Grand at Central World on my more recent stay in June (great 26th floor pool here), and for a bit longer walk more of a great value budget option Evergreen Place. For that one, while walkable, you might be tempted to just take a BTS ride at the Ratchathewi Station which Evergreen is right next to. There are a few others in the area in walking distance too, and again this area is a great place to be based in Bangkok, with Siam Paragon being the highlight of it."

Some are so popular they have queues in the evening. The atmosphere is a little soulless, and the prices halfway to western, but I have enjoyed some good food and drink - at Mosburger, Royal Tandoori, the bread shops, the toast shop, the NZ icecream parlour, Krispy kreme donuts, etc. The typical fast food joints are here too but go for more interesting fare.There's a gourmet supermarket at the end too.

Food is big. Very big. In fact, almost a whole floor is dedicated to F&B and there are many other eateries scattered throughout the mall. You would be so spoiled for choice you wouldn't know where to begin. Seriously! Then there is the cinema, which is state of the art and most probably the best in town. In terms of accessibility, it too is perfect considering the Skytrain Siam stop is literally at its doorstep. As it is located along the \"shopping belt\", there are plenty of malls on either direction of Siam Paragon, all within minutes walking distance so this would be a good spot to start your day.Chris Lee"

I especially loved the 3rd floor, which was reserved for luxury car stores. Rolls Royce, Lamborghini, Porsche, etc."

I was told all food venues pay paragon monthly rent which covers pest control. Their restaurant is not the only one with rat problems. Planning a visit? Fine. Enjoy. Remember to look at the ceiling, or lack of it, it is a rat run. I have complained to Paragon Centre. I will not be doing business there again. Some may say that rats are part of the culture of Thailand. I agree, they are seemingly accepted in some areas. Surely they are not acceptable in this setting."

Heaps of people but big enough that it doesnt feel crowded. Pay a visit to the Paragon department store - it may look pricey but i grabbed a few bargains on label items (Nine West, Adidas, Speedo). If I had time to try mote stuff on (we arrived an hour before closing) I wouldve bought more as some of the Thai labels for ladies dresses (same floor as shoes, bags) were on sale at 50-80% off and saw some gorgeous looking dresses at only 990baht!!"

Personally, we found it simply expensive, providing nothing I could not buy at home for around the same price. We much preferred the Chatuchak weekend market or night markets, though I must say they had a really nice bookstore upstairs. However, the real reason you should go to Paragon is to go downstairs and visit their Ocean World for a magnificent aquarium."

The shops sell prestige brands so the quality of the products is well assured. If you're looking for cheaper products, then go to MBK mall which is nearby but do practise your bargaining skills before you enter. For Siam Paragon, there is a great food court and I would recommend trying authentic Thai food. Cafe Chili and Manna serve spicy Thai Food, however, if you're on budget, try Kalpapruek which is more affordable."

You will definitely need more than 3 hours here. - Big and spacious. Love the clean and classy look as well. Makes shopping comfortable, although branded goods in Bangkok is more expensive vs Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.- I love the restaurants and food choices here. So many to choose from. I recommend G Management for delicious Thai food. Love the roti with chicken/pork curry, roti with fried chicken, fried rice with yellow curry pork and tom kha kai. Dessert place is ample \u2013 so many selection from Western to local.- Kinokuniya book shop \u2013 one of the biggest book shop that I have ever been to. Bought 2 books :)- Entertainment \u2013 big cinemas and bowling alley if you are interested. They even have an aquarium here."

I also disliked how they overcharge foreigners to the aquarium at 900 Baht for a very small variety of sealife. The cinema is great and the 3d IMAX is always fun (I saw the Hobbit 2 with my fiancee). The shopping is okay but nothing different than any other shopping center except in the amount of available stores. Most of the stores being for people looking to spend very high amounts of money rather than causual spending. I am a big fan of reading so I do enjoy the massive bookstore that is in the Paragon called kinokuniya.

Yes, it is luxurious, and yes, you can buy anything here from a Rolls Royce to a bowl of noodles, but it is soulless.One of the things that you can do for free is people watch, especially at the shameless brand junkies that are drooling over very high priced items, and the mindless drones that are watching the crowd carefully in case they see someone famous, or fail to spot a trend developing... I think the current trend is to wear a scarf, even in the tropics.By all means go to have a look at the name brands, but then walk the 400 metres to MBK, and have a fun shopping experience."

It has everything from Hermes and Chanel, to Cartier and Bulgari, to H & M and Zara, to electronics and book stores, to kitchen appliances and cars, including Rolls Royces and Maseratis. There is also a store devoted to Thai souvenir items. I particularly enjoy the very large Gourmet Market \u2013 and often purchase gifts there. The food court is quite large and has McDonalds and KFC, as well as Thai, Japanese, Italian, Mexican and American cafes and restaurants, as well as several places just devoted to deserts. I don\u2019t go to Siam Paragon with the intent to make large purchases, but with the intent to enjoy the experience \u2013 it is a vibrant and fun way to spend a couple of hours, if you have the time."

I will try to make some order in this complex and make your experience easier. First, Siam Paragon, located in Rama I street, opposite to the Thai police HQ, is also the CENtral station of the Sky Train. The Sukhumvit line and Silom lines meet here and you can interchange between them.Siam Paragon is quite new. Opened in 2006. The core of this shopping mall is Paragon department store holding 4 floors with all the high-end stuff: Jewelry, cosmetics, watches, high style fashion, home appliance, electronics etc.In the open space around the department store, you will find almost everything. From shoe lace to a Maseraty car.The basement floor holds the Ocean world. A magnificent attraction for all ages. The ground floor is the food court and a giant deli. On the right side there is a Thai traditional food court where you buy a local debit card to deduct at any food station. The sitting is close to big fish aquariums. On the left side you find numerous restaurants of all styles with priority to Japanese.The M floor is the main entry from the Sky train station. It is the Luxury floor. In this floor there are many fashion shops and coffee shops.2nd floor occupies Life style shops and leisure. 3rd floor- Living & Technology. Floor 4-Paragon Passage & IT World. 5th floor-Entertainment. Cinema halls, iMax, Bowling and exhibitions.You should dedicate at least 5 hours for this mall. Not including movies and dinng."

One of the largest and most central is Siam Paragon. It's very convenient as you walk straight off the Siam Skytrain station into the premises without being exposed to the weather. It's got everything - all kinds of restaurants, an enormous supermarket, shops of every description and brand name (including two excellent book stores), about a dozen cinemas, banks, a huge aquarium, etc., etc. Besides the supermarket the one thing which draws me back almost daily is the extensive food court. There are a couple of vegetarian outlets which actually provide brown rice - a rarity in Bangkok restaurants! A plate of rice and several varieties of vegetables will cost about Baht 100. It's a good deal and you know the produce is fresh as the place is always packed. In the same area on the ground floor the supermarket also has an excellent salad bar and, close by, a soup bar with an extensive range of soups. Plastic cutlery is provided by the cashier's assistant when paying for your purchases.Siam Paragon is also conveniently linked by overhead walkways to several other malls such as Siam Center, Discovery Center, the Arts Center, MBK, Central World and Gaysorn Plaza."

The prices for imported labels are consider high as compared to Singapore. What I like about this mall is the amazing spread of its food and beverages. Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Fastfood and Thai food, the spread is endless. From foodcourt to restaurant depending on your budget for the day. There is a place that will fit your wallet as well as your apettite. The amount of spa products on sale here is also awesome. All the different local brands ofspa products can be found here in Siam Paragon. There is also a section of the mall which houses branded cars such as Rolls Royce. The supermarket is really fun to walk around in. It house lots of local produce as well as imported products like wagyu beef. Enjoy a nice afternoon tea at one of the many cafes after your shopping. I recommend Mandarin Oriental Shop, Vanilla Brasserie or TWG for their lovely cakes and drinks."

My favorite places are the stationary dept. on the third floor of Central where you can check out the latest toy and stationary trends from Japan and Korea. It's also surprisingly cheap to buy basic stationary there. There's also a good book store called Kynokinoia or something on the 2nd or third floor which is good for buying English books. Another useful store is the ASIA Books where you can buy a waterproof bus map for 99B - that could save you a lot on taxi fares!The food court is on the ground floor and is predicably more expensive than the food courts anywhere else. If you have money you can get any designer you can name here - if you don't you can walk around dreaming that you really afford all the shiny things in the windows!"

It was our kids' first Kidzania experience and compared to Kidzania Japan, in Bangkok there's kids ticket option to play all they want. In parent speak, this means at least 6 hours of educational playing (kids will need more hours to participate in all careers). Shopping wise, almost every imaginable brand is there including the fanciest car brands, such as Bentley. Feast your eyes on food choices.

An amazing way to spend a few idle hours."

Access to the mall is really easy, just use the BTS and stop at Siam Station, follow the signs, and there you are, inside a mall that a blend of luxury and classiness on top of being huge (2nd biggest mall of Thailand after CentralWorld).It is really nice to walk inside, everything is well located, and make access easy to all the stores and parts of the mall.There is a cinema complex (Paragon Cineplex) inside the mall at the 5th floor, and the Siam Pavalai (one of the theather) is really impressive (1200+ seats).They have a great good court, where you can choose from a wide variety of food. They use a card to that you top-up with an amount of your choice, do not forget to give it back the same day if you wish to get the money remaining on it back.As for stores, a lot of designers store such as Chanel, LV, Gucci, jewelry, electronic, shoes, sports stores, they also have a store where you can find Thai handicraft, ideal for souvenirs. Let's not forget Siam Ocean World, the biggest Aquarium of South-East Asia, well, they are definitely not lying, worth a look."

The prices of movies depends when you go and the seat you pick.( bring a long sleeve shirt because it does get very chilly in the theater). I've been to the bowling alley on a number occasions and found it clean and trouble free. The mall itself carries all the name brands that you could ask for and none are low end!! Prices are expensive, so don't think you can find any bargains!! Even the Paragon department store is expensive. The food court on B1 has lots of choices and not that expensive if you pick thai food.

I went here with a friend on my first in Thailand, largely because my friend wanted some luxury shirts and I figured that given my jet lag I'd last longer in an air conditioned environment. I thought I'd defer any insights into Thai culture until I was rested enough to brave the Grand Palace and Wat Arun.What I found instead was a panorama of contemporary Thai consumerism,itself based on that mothership of consumption, the USA. The Siam Paragon however, is a mall like no one in America ever conceived, with Lamborghini and Rolls Royce showrooms, a audio salon where a sound system could cost as much as one of the aforementioned cars and enough luxury goods retailers to put any mall in the US to shame. Throw in SouthEast Asia's largest aquarium and you've got something for the whole family. Pair this mall with the MBK Center and you've got the high a middle of ground of consumerism. Go to the Patpong Night Market and you'll have plenty of low-end consumer culture, too.What I really found captivating, and ultimately very educational, was the food court area in the basement of the mall. My firned and i must have spent a hour or more just walking through the food vendors before settling on something to eat. Check out the unusual (for American tastes anyway) baked goods, such as the green curry naan, and the chicken curry buns, survey the unusual desserts, the list goes on. Not to be missed: MosBurger -- Japanese hamburgers like you've never had them before."

For the stalls, you buy a prepaid value card at the desk. If you don't use all the money, you can get it refunded same day. Local Thai dishes for the equivalent of $2.50. Yum."

Lots of electronic stuff, good selection of clothes, and the sixth floor had a very good selection of home goods, including packable ones. Head for Exotique Thai for a nice and good selection of local home ware, some interesting contemporary takes on thai clothing, and arts and crafts and jewelry. Some great food options on the sixth floor and in the basement. If you want to take things home or back to your hotel, I'd highly recommend the upscale grocery in the basement. Wonderful selection!"

You can wander from one to another. However, if you are looking for the largest bookstore in Bangkok (with English titles as well as others), head to Kinokuniya on the 4th floor. If you are tired of haggling at the street stands and want something special to take home as a reminder of your trip to Bangkok, head to the area known as Passages. Here you will find beautiful metalwork, wood, wood inlay, and silk. The quality is high so do not expect rock bottom prices. There are also some very good Japanese restaurants on this floor as well."

I did not really shop in Siam Paragon (other than at Uniqlo, which is an excellent clothing chain), but the main attraction for me about Siam Paragon was the AMAZING food court downstairs. They call it the \"Food Hall\", and for good reason! The selection of food stands took my breath away! There are so many different kinds of choices: 1. desserts, both western and asian, including Japanese style ice cream, french patisseries etc 2. traditional thai dishes 3. bakeries 4. chinese restaurants 5. indian food 6. korean food 7. japanese food 8. fast food chains, like burger king 9. coffee e.g. starbucks..... My eyes were overwhlemed by all the amazing colourful dishes, and my nose was in heaven from the lovely aromas!! Some food outlets I really liked: 1. toast box: this is a Singaporean chain I believe that sells thick toast with kaya (coconut) jam 2. bread talk : this is a bakery chain with yummy asian style western buns (yes, sounds funny, but you will understand when you see it.) I am a big bread fan so these two places made me happy! The supermarket is also amazing and has great souvenirs. (e.g. spices, teas, coconut oil, beauty products using Thai ingredients.) This is definitely my favourite mall food court in Bangkok!! You must try this!! It can be very crowded though so just take care of your belongings.The washroom in this mall is very high class and are very well maintained. The other stores in the mall are nice too (high end) but the main attraction for me was the food!!!"

At the lower ground floor, there's a grocery but I was surprised to find some items more expensive than the ubiquitous 7-Eleven (there were 3 7-Eleven stores right next to our hotel). The ladies at the information desk were very helpful and the toilets were very clean. You should know that after a tour, you can choose to be dropped at your hotel or at Siam Paragon. Choose the latter and extend your tour of Bangkok with some retail therapy."

I got a dress, skirt and accessories to match and once all the discounts added up I got the lot for the original price of the dress.

It's like \"Oh, this one is just looking, so no need to bother\". I mean, we get a lot of that same attitude at the stores in Malaysia, so it was always refreshing to shop in Thailand where service was much more warm and friendly. Now it seems like things are going the same way in Bangkok - I found the same poor attitude among the sales attendants at Central stores as well. What a pity!"

It is by far the biggest mall I've ever been to, there isn't anything that you need that isn't somewhere in that mall. The food court is actually just a whole floor of different restaurants, with everything from Dairy Queen to authentic Thai restaurants. No matter your taste, you can find something you like there. I would avoid the basement aquarium, I thought it was horrible. As someone that has gone to many different aquariums, I thought it was by far the worst I've seen on my travels. The rest of the mall has name brand stuff you can find anywhere else. This mall isn't cheap, if you think you're going to come from another country and find great deals...you aren't. I did a lot of comparing prices there versus in the United States and they were about equal, and some things such as Apple products were actually more expensive. One of the most interesting things about the mall is that even though they are blaring american music, you will not find a person that works there that speaks english. Trust me I tried finding a face shaver and stupid me forgot to at least take a photo of one and bring it when I came. So if you're looking for something in particular, you would be wise to either have a photo of it or be able to mime what you need. It sounds ridiculous, but when you're in a mall that big it can save you a lot of time (and I'm speaking from experience)."

If you want some greater variety for food, visit the nearby Central World.The Uniqlo and H&M stores here are good for clothes shopper. Also, if you have some time, watch a movie at Paragon Cineplex as the cinema here is probably the best in the country (and among anywhere I have been to).If you come in the evening, this place is super-crowded. Parking is really hard to find, so prepare sometime to drive around hopelessly before being able to actually get out of the car."

We always spend some time at Paragon each time we are in BKK - the food court has a huge range of different kinds of food, which is great if you are in a group and some want Thai, somone wants a burger, and someone wants sushi. There is an H&M which sells (some) Western-sized clothes. The Paragon department store also has some really good shops - and the maternity section at Mothercare is really good for Western-sized maternity underwear! The clear favourite thing in Paragon is the large bookstore on the 3rd floor - a great resource for the book-starved expat, and it's not just stocked with airport-lit either - a huge classics section, as well as contemporary fiction, a good non-fiction section, with political/economic/geographical/anthropological titles. Also a great kids section. The movie theatres on the top floor are really lux - expensive - but so much fun to splurge if there is a good movie - VIP comfy sofas, a blanket and a big tub of popcorn - bliss."

You can find all Thai made products. We bought lots of aromatherapy stuffs and managed to claim VAT refund. You'r spoilt for choices as there are many restaurants and cafes on Level 5. But be prepared to pay a little more.For cheaper options, head onto the basement level where there are many eateries plus a food court. We bought lots of Thai street snacks from the eateries which is much cleaner. There's also a supermarket called Gourmet Market. We bought some Honey Thai mangoes at the fair to bring home.For those with younger kids, Kidzania (from KL) just opened on Level 6. It's an indoor play area for Kids as old as 12yrs."

The great thing is that the food court is very clean and has a lot of variety of foods. There is also the Ocean World which is definitely worth a visit. This shopping is quite easily accessible by the train."

Underground have ocean world and big food court,restaurants also around, there always crowd but still can find a place to take a rest during shopping. My husband and I can stay inside for 8hrs for shopping, tough but still comfortable and easy to find stuffs. Best option for shopping in Bangkok."

You can shop in comfort here, because the air conditioning is good enough to withstand the heat of Bangkok, and the variety of goods is amazing. In addition, they have a large food court that sells practically everything under the sun. You can have your pick of cuisines and they all look delicious! The pad thai at the Asian station is the best I've eaten in Bangkok! There are also stalls selling fruit juices and local delicacies, so it is a nice place to go to if you want to sample the local food but want to be sure that it is clean and sanitary."

It's next to the BTS (sky train) and you can easily access a taxi or tuk tuk. This place is huge! There is a large sound stage out front where performances are held. There are many floors and it's a lot of high end shopping but I went to the food court and got some great Thai noodles and soup still at a reasonable price. You can really spend a lot of time people watching. The bathrooms are easy to find and clean and there are many elevators and escalators. It's worth a look if you've got some time to spare, even more so if you have fat wallet. Bring your camera, there is so much going on you're bound to snap some fun photos."

Remember to take ID so that you can fill in all your paperwork to claim back you VAT. Another great point is if you spend over 2000thb in the Siam Paragon Department Store, you can claim the VAT for all purchases. So it's worthwhile making a few purchases ;)The luxury brands will do your VAT paperwork for you, while purchasing through the department store you'll need to go to a VAT claims counter. There were two on the food court level, but staff will happily direct you there.The food court is great. There was a Chinese restaurant we ate at (I think it was red dragon).

After that, me and my gf will usually settle down at a place called Jelly Jan at one of the upper level for their tasty cupcake and hot drink. You don't really have to buy the goods here to feel great, the mere experience of just going around window shopping is sufficient for us.

The shops here are no cheaper than the uk and in some instance more expensive, however the canteen part of the food court is very good value for money (\u00a36 for dinner for 2). There are chains here also which are more expensive and so called high end restaurants but the canteen seemed to be doing more authentic food.You pay money on to a card then go eat, the card is swiped every time you make a purchase then at the end if you have money left they redeem it.No service no fuss and very cheap, I can see it working well if your there all day as it would cover a couple of meals. As for the food it's ok soup noodles, rice dishes, noodle dishes.For me it's on a BTS and close to Bangkok business district so was good for the convenience."

This mall offered you variety choice of items from clothing, bag, shoe, food and many more. It is definitely a place you should visit for your Bangkok modern shopping experience, and over here you are not only being pampered with load of brand and choices of items but also on food. Go visit their food court and you will get to eat a lot of local made food, do aware that this food court use a prepaid card system to buy anything but you can claim back unused credit so no worry on this. And do visit other restaurant that is here beside the food court, you will be furthered pampered as well. I tried Ging Kalpapruek located on Ground floor, food prepared is quite good but pricing wise is a bit high. After your meal, do visit the Ocean world as well, over there you can see wide range of wild life and insects.

Short of money there are quite a few banks within the complex and lots of ATM machines.Security is very good but spare a watchful eye on your purse or wallet as such a place draws the occasional pick pocket due to locals shopping wearing their best bling,bling.Do not expect to bargain but to pay the full retail price for the privilege............................"

I had Indian food there and it was excellent (House of India), very flavorful, not too spicy but just the right amount, naan made to order, very fresh and it's mall food, in the mall and it's cheap! They have 5 star restaurants in there too, btw don't eat at Taling Paling it's like the McDonald's of Thai food, it's bland and disgusting. We found an Italian place up on the 6th or 7th level, excellent, This guy fr. Washington D.C. opened it up and runs it, very good service. You can spend an entire day in here, literally. They have a floor dedicated to electronics, some dedicated to designer wears, some dedicated to up and coming Thai designers, luxury cars, this place is really amazing. They had a place called Thanni I think, like a British tea place 5* with sandwiches, etc., very cool, worth it, do not go to MBK mall you will be very disappointed, go straight to Siam Paragon and other malls around the area, it's pretty interesting."

We gravitated more towards the huge bookshop on the third floor which is allegedly the best one in Bangkok.

I\u2019ve been going to Paragon often for the past 5 years as it feels like any other shopping malls back at home (but for Thai living standard this place is considered up-market). Noticed that the service has been declining over the years i.e. The sales-personnel just stand around & look uninterested in serving the customers. Anyway I experienced it myself first hand, encountered the most unpleasant event at the ground floor perfumes section (Hugo Boss & D&G counters). I was with a Thai friend and we are just browsing through the perfumes i.e. doing the usual girls stuffs testing the perfumes out. First scenario: the Hugo Boss counter female staff was rather reluctant & unwillingly to serve us. So we ignore it & popped over to the next counter just beside Boss which is the D&G.Second scenario (the \u201chighlight\u201d): As we didn\u2019t buy anything, the D&G male staff blatantly said in Thai \u201c..why see if don\u2019t buy\u2026 & added the \u2018F\u2019 word\u201d!!!!IMMEDIATELY my Thai friend pulled me away from the counter & told me what the staff just said. OMG!! I can\u2019t believe Paragon hires such bad attitude staffs!!!Overall, the staffs are totally lacking in customer service relationships i.e. politeness, willingness to serve customers, etc.. It seems the sales-personnel are just chasing the potential customers away with their bad attitude!!I have never encountered such similar bad service in my own country."

Right next to a skytrain station in the centre of town means that this is one of the most accessible shopping malls in Bangkok. It has an upmarket feel about it but it wasn't quite what we were looking for. Clean and comfortable.The food court on the basement floor is amazing!!! Everything you could possibly want - local and international cuisines are catered for. All at a reasonable price. An oddity (at least from a Brit) is the fact that the food court operates on a cash card system. You purchase a card loaded with credit which is then used to buy food. Obviously any excess is refundable. Convenient if you plan on eating here on more than one occasion (a distinct possibility)."

If u are new to Bangkok or Thailand some of the goodies are worth to bring home where they specify local produce. Things like durian chips, their mango slice, pork tidbits and etc...but of course if u have more time these items can also be brought elsewhere. This place is really accessible by bts (sky train) . U would want to avoid paying more on cab if u are traveling after hours of shopping. Plan ur time well to reduce transportation stress especially if u have elderly with u.

The food court floor is incredible, the movie theatres are a lovely haven for tired feet, and the Paragon department store had some great reasonably priced clothes (womens size 12 to 14 Australian). There were plenty of sale items, and the Thai souvenir section on the top floor had exquisite high-end souvenir items and clothing at good prices. I would normally shy away from places like this due to the prices, but maybe it's the great Aussie dollar at the moment, because every time I looked at a price tag my first thought was \"Seriously? Is that all? I also got some really nice clothes from Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and MNG. My main disappointment in BKK was the tacky glittery costume jewellery, I got much better and more tasteful items at Platinum Fashion Mall at super-cheap prices."

You get convenience and choice, do not expect great bargains: interesting enough: the collections of the big brands are the same than everywhere else: this means that on winter sales, you'll find a still good choice of warm garments (useless in Thailand, therefore unsold). Lots of staff, not necessarily useful. Paying can be a pain, redeeming coupons is definitely a pain. Crowded on weekends. The supermarket in the basement is great: you'll find all the Thai products: lot of Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese... all what you need to cook in all the best world cousine. again, not cheap, but vast choice.

It has storage service where you can have your purchases or bags kept there until 9 pm. Grocery Store: Advice: Eat as much FRUITS as you can!!! You can get some of them from those street booth, but if you are concerned with the hygienic issues, get the fruits from the grocery store. The grocery store inside Siam Paragon has variety of fruits. I would suggest you to try a fruit named LONGKONG! I never have seen or tasted it before, and it was good! Of course the mangoes, and if you would like to experience that smelly fruit, Durian, go ahead! I think they are great!! My Experience: We bought a bag of mangoes and was peeled and cut, placed in a bag, costing us only 40 Bach, which is not even US$1!!!!!! Mochi:There is a booth located inside the grocery store selling all different kinds of mochi! Try that!There are many different types of food just outside the food court, try them all if you have the time!"

Its the flagship mall of Bangkok city, I understand that, but if you are after brand items then why not go to London or NY, why will you go to Bkk!!?The shopping mall is very fancy looking and nice place to take pictures, especially the water fountain at the entrance is nice, but otherwise nothing much in there. We didnt have time to go to the bottom of the mall where I guess the sea world was, however may be we will do it the next time round!!"

But after a week of showing freinds about central BKK we were ready to get out of the heat and crush of the streets. We headed for Pantip Plaza. I had visited the excellent book shop before so we went there first to equip our friends with Nancy Chandlers map of Chiang Mai; our next destination. The selection is amazing with some of the best art and architecture books I have seen for a long time - a whole wall of them. Priced at half what I would pay in Australia. I bought a couple of heavy weights and posted them later - BKK post is very cost effective and they have a wrapping service at the offices I have been to. My friends had a coffee in the small but nice cafe at the rear of the shop and took advantage of the view from window seats. Meanwhile I caught the elevator from inside the shop up to the top floors where the IMAX and other theaters are situated. There is also a large ten pin bowling rink. I booked us in for a film later that evening which worked out at about $5 each. By the way, cinema is a major deal to Thai people. These cinemas were very comfortable and they have a serious VIP lounge and a private option as well.Meanwhile the ladies had booked in for some vital nail refurbishment, which I was assured was a snip at $70 for a full set of French nail \"retreads\". I understood their experience was an outstanding success.We boys headed for the Supercar showrooms on the 5th? floor. It seems odd to see gleaming Porche, Ferrari and others at such an elevation. There was a small porche shop that had some really nicely designed gear - we didn't buy anything.We met up in the basement for a late afternoon lunch in the excellent foodhall - you buy vouchers and exchange them for food. There is also a brilliant produce hall whith superbly presented quality fruits, pastries and all the other comfort foods you can think of. This hall was our favourite. I would rate it with Fortum and Mason and David Jones in its own way.We felt like a breath of air and we had \"a smoker\", so we wandered outside onto the plaza. This area has a large fountain water feature which is fun and attracts a lot of locals - a great people watching area. We soon got into conversation with several locals. There were a lot of \"beautiful people\" about and they all seemed fine with having their pictures taken.The kids soon took off to check out the massive aquarium that is in the sub-basement. I am told you can go out in a boat and even arrange to swim with the sharks.Meanwhile, we found a huge music outlet and selected some authentic Thai music tracks. After which we met up for the evening cinema treat. By the way, you have to check in all cameras at the entrance I was a bit concerned at this but it was fine and is obviously a routine thing.I pointed out to the kids (in their 20s) that opposite the main entrance and on the other side of the road is an area set back that has a lot of evening music and bars where the younger Thais congregate.Siam Paragon is near MBK and can easily be accessed from the overhead rail system. This links via a walkway to MBK so you can stay off street level. If you need to catch a cab East to say Khao San area then you are best to go to MBK and at the back of which is a cab rank and they will tell the driver to put the meter on."

Taxis are the same, they urge you to stop at a tourist spot (jewelry etc) although a nice educational stop, if you are tired and in a hurry to go rest at your hotel, best walk and take the train."

This is one huge mall that offers international brands as well as very well known local brands of Thailand. The mall is connected to different mall complex, all of which is just a walk away thru the over pass / walk way that was built in the heart of the shopping district of Siam.Think of it this way, if you want to buy Chanel, Dior or other world famous luxury brands you head to Siam Paragon. Nothing fake there, just pure luxury for those people who have a taste for expensive things. Now if you like local brands that are high end you can visit the neighboring Siam Discovery, it is also part of the mall complex. In this mall houses expensive local brands that are uniquely Thai.If you want to see more international shops that are not in Siam Paragon you might want to check out The Emporium.Now if you want to get a (sort of bargain) for Thailand local designs go visit Siam Center, it is very trendy and all the young hip locale go their to find unique designs that they can take home.Note that all of these 4 shopping centers are connected by a walk bridge so you will not have a hard time going from one place to another.Be SURE to ask for the Tourist Card, its a gold card printed in paper that you get if you are a Tourist. Just present your passport to the outlet of which you are purchasing your item and they will give you the card or better yet ask for it at the information desk of each mall.it will give you 5% discount to the department store and up to 70% discount in the shopping complex plus 7% VAT Refund at the airport.Have a fun time shopping!"

The best thing about this mall is the gourmet supermarket where you can buy a lot of imported goods as well some of the little places around there where you can buy street food which is cleaner and not tarnished with street pollution. The bigger restaurants around there are just tourist traps, higher priced with kind of boring food. The exception is probably Mandarin Oriental which has good cakes.The Kinokuniya bookshop is probably one of if not the best bookshop in Bankok. It is there version of Borders books. The cinema is also good and shows a fair few western movies.It's also handy that Siam Paragon has direct access to the Skytrain on the 2nd floor. Overall though I'd say that if you were in Bangkok longer than a week you'd probably give up going here unless for shopping at the supermarket."

The staff were absolutely brilliant - they knew their stock, and nothing at all was too much effort. There's a good food court on the ground floor, very much like those you get in western shopping centres, but with Asian food. It made a nice change for lunch: obviously a bit dearer than eating on the street but it was clean and air conditioned."

You'll pay the same as back home (if you're an American) and you'll see predictable cuisine in the food court, same as you would back home.HOWEVER --There are three great reasons to go here:1) The movie theater, with its VIP seating, is amazing. Imagine: the world's most comfortable, cushy recliner, blanket, all in front of a huge, state-of-the-art movie screen.2) When you need something Western, from sneakers to gym gear to designer handbags, you know it will be there.3) There is an ex-pat grocer near the food court that has many of the culinary delights you will inevitably miss from your Western home. A bit pricey, but worth every penny."

It is your standard mall but it is very clean and very big. My favorite part of the mall was the large food court on the lower level. They have so many delicious options. And the gourmet market is amazing, it's like a Thai whole foods. I went back like three times during my stay at Thailand for their delicious coconut rice. It is out of this world. They make it on site so it's fresh. This mall also houses the Thai aquarium which is a great place to visit if you are in the mall. You get to ride in a glass bottom boat among sharks. Overall I would recommend checking out the Siam Paragon. Also it's very accessible from the BTS."

This is not a place for the average shopper, not even the upper class, this is for the super wealthy! Who shops here? Not the average tourist and definitely not the average thai shopper. I have been 3 times, the mall is always full but if you actually look into all these shops all you will see is idle sales people. How often is there someone buying a 4000$ Chanel bag or a 1000$ hermes dress? There were only 2 stores I saw that I felt comfortable going into, Mango and Zara, but I always shop there in Montreal so I didn't bother. This was a real disappointment, I was at least hoping for a few more mid range options. Terminal 21 is a bit better as far as the stores go.The food court is great though, I ate there 3 times and picked up some stuff at the gourmet market.

The purple food court is using a top up card as a mean to pay food n beverage. Deposit some money at counter desk an they will give you card to pay with. The balance of the card can only be refunded if u ask the counter desk in the same day u get the card. Many currency exchanges so easy to get Baht when u need it. However be advised that branded imported clothes in Siam not always cheaper than in its origin countries due to import tax. (if u want cheaper local brand fashion head to platinum mall in front of pratunam market. If u want cheap Thai souvenirs I recommend chatuchak market on weekend only.

The place is very clean, and full of Thailand's upper middle class society who simply go there for lunch/dinner and don't even bother with the shopping.You will also find the best supermarket in Bangkok.

There are VIP seats, premium seats and all sort of other extras. The lobby of the movie theater is a spectacle in and of itself.The food court is mind blowing. I nearly got lost walking around in the food court. There are so many choices and surprisingly there are so many American franchises I nearly fell over when I saw them; Krispy Kreme Donuts, Subway, Starbucks, Burger King, Tony Roma's just to name a few.The location is perfectly situated next to the Siam stop on the BTS.

If you are looking for something ALOT cheaper with your fakes and the ability to barter, head to MBK mall which is a short walk across the road. We did most of our shopping there. I also heard there is another mall which rivals this one called Gaysorn but we didn't get time to visit this one.The mall itself would take hours to explore every store - but the department store is great if you are looking for something in particular (the designer stores are on the outsides of the department store) and they seem to incorporate many different brands.The eatery downstairs is overwhelming. They do however have the cheat option of getting McDonalds or KFC if you just cannot figure out what to get (which was my case) and they all speak English well enough to help out. I found out later on they have a cinema, 'Ocean World' and hotel connected as well, and there are always events happening in the surrounding squares."

Because it is the only ATM network that does not charge the additional five dollars to use a local ATM. You can't miss the ATM it is purple located right next to a watch repair kiosk."

If you just looked at the entrance point where water fountain square BTS and huge food court sit you'd think this mall was a bustling hyper shopping experience. None could be farther from the truth. The layout of the mall is not user friendly and the shops are high end and for the most part, irrelevant. I think most people come here for the AC and to get out of the sun. The life of the mall begins from the lower level food court up through the car showrooms, California Wow and ends at the awesome cineplex on the top level. The IMAX and quality of the movie theaters is very high end. The shopping part of Siam Paragon can definitely be skipped."

The mall itself is huge but well set up (generally similar stores are grouped together). It is convenient to get to as it is directly by the Siam Skytrain station. It addition, you are also close to Central World, Siam Discovery, Gaysorn and a host of other shopping complexes all within 5-10 minutes (walking) of each other.In addition to shopping, it also contains a cinema, an aquarium and a host of restaurants.There is nothing uniquely Thai about the mall. It is just a huge flashy shopping center filled with luxury brands. When you are inside it, you could just as easily be in Hong Kong or Las Vegas. Great place if you are looking to do some high end shopping (or window shopping!). If you are looking for something a little different, you can visit Siam Square across the road. It's an open air cluster of small shops and will give you much more of a feel for the Thai street shopping experience in all its crowded glory.In addition, the Siam Discovery Center (connected by walkway) is specifically branded as a teenager hangout (think Shibuya in Tokyo). So if you want to check out more cutting edge designers or just see what Thai teenagers with disposable cash do in their time off, it is worth checking out."

I assume most people holidaying in Bangkok don't need to buy a Lamborghini; just in case you do, there's a showroom on the 3rd floor. There's also an aquarium (overpriced), a pretty good food court and an exceptional movie theatre on the top floor. Perhaps when in Bangkok you should be outside getting sunburnt, not inside relaxing, but this also gives you the unique Thai experience of everyone standing up immediately before the film starts, while the national anthem plays. And who'd want to miss out on that?"

Unless you come from the Paris Hilton school of shopping and money is of no object whatsoever, please indulge and load up on Hermes, Gucci, etc, etc. Although prices here are much higher than in the US. Don't expect bargain shopping here as this is clearly not Walmart, Target nor Macy's. Think Barney's...Instead, head straight to the food hall at the upper basement for a selection of places to eat. Price range from very cheap (B60 for rice plate) to moderately priced (B200 rice meal). The gourmet shop though offers items great for bringing back home.

They have \"Paragon Shopping\" store where they sell a lot of things...shoes, sports wear, stationery, etc. Slightly upmarket, but the choice is varies.They have a huge food court with various choices.BUT, for me, the best was - AQUARIUM on the bottom floor!!! the Aquarium is AMAZING!!!!!

It seemed like the mall always had something going on--- Wednesday night they had a wrestling match, Thursday a concert... etc... And the mall was ALWAYS crowded. I went on a Friday night just to eat at the magnificent food court, and almost got stampeeded. The mall is very high end--with stores like Marc Jacobs, Hermes and Lacoste. There are some mid-tier stores like Zara and Mango, but if you are looking for a deal, this mall may not be your best bet."

Unique stores including specific high end Thai design and crafts. We visited on a week day, manageable numbers of people yet still plenty of opportunities to sit back and people watch. On the days we visited didn't see too many western tourists which makes a nice change. Visited Loft where a very friendly, hip young Thai couple (also shopping there) offered the use of their discount card when we were purchasing goods, and gave us useful tips on other places to visit!"

Despite its flashy and modern looking exterior, the actual theatre I was in (#6) had a very strong mold smell (causing an allergic reaction for me) . It also had sticky, worn seats with tears and soiled spots. I had to pull a tissue out of my pocket and put it on my arm rest to stop my arm from sticking to it during the film! Seats are asssigned so you can't just move. The Siam Paragon Grand Theatres bills itself of one of the best in Bangkok but I hope for the locals that this is not the truth!"

So, last December me wife and myself were in Bangkok for a couple of days, and we decided to try it out. Wow, in keeping with the upscale shopping upstairs, the food court is really a collection of really good restaurants, bakeries, and beverage places. There are no stalls like in a food court, but rather a open plan collection of eating places, each with its own staff, seating and proper kitchens. The eating places are too varied and numerous to list in the review. In summary, you can eat Japanese, Thai, American, Italian, French, Mexican, etc. etc. all located in one pretty large floor space. You can have proper meals with wine accompaniments, you can eat Japanese sushi, burgers, whatever. There are some great places for desserts too. And a supermarket selling gourmet specialties.Worth a visit - more than once."

The economics of the place are mysterious but it's really at the heart of Bangkok. It is amazing how many ordinary Thais have never been here and wouldn't consider going."

Sure you have Paragon Department store with just about everything you could want... In addition to this you have many other shops for a wide variety of goods... For me the biggest attraction in this place has to be the Gourmet Supermarket and all of the restaurants on the same floor... This is the best 1-Stop spot for just about anything you could want to eat from Krispy-Kreme Doughnuts, MOS Burger, Auntie Anne's Pretzels, Au Bon Pain and many other alike... For a person that spends a lot of time in S.E. Asia, these things mean a lot..!If you are with others that are shopping and you are not up to that kind of thing... Then head to Siam Ocean World which is located just below all this excellent food...!"

On the ground floor (G floor) are a large number of restaurants ranging from very exclusive to very simple... and there is even a crispy cream for donut lovers. There is a fantastic movie complex with the latest movies and if you don't mind spending a bit more for a ticket (800 baht/ticket) you can get the luxury seats in a special theater (you even get a blanket made of Thai silk) which includes complimentary coffee or soft drinks (juices) and small cakes/cookies.

Nothing special about the architecture, but on the third and fourth floors you will find boutiques owned and operated by Thai designers. The fashions are just as lust-worthy as what the luxury shops are selling down the street, but they are also totally unique and much, much less expensive.If you're into fashion, if you like shopping, spend a day in Siam Center.

Writing a review about a shopping mall is always going to be a tricky exercise and highly subjective, and there's always a better-than-average chance of offending someone who chances upon my thoughts on these things. So be it ... On a general level, the shopping mall is the transmogrification of Olde Worlde hometown markets that had personality, character, and life, into something that is culturally crude, aesthetically anonymous, existentially sterile, and strangely Stepfordized (see: the film 'The Stepford Wives' to understand where I'm coming from here) so that if you were to be transplanted inside one without actually knowing where you were, you'd be hard put to recognize this temple of Mammon from another. They all look exactly the same. But, could we live without them? a moot point .. Hailed as some form of shopping paradise, the SIAM Paragon is nothing of the sort; sure it has lots and lots of consumer-oriented outlets, and is a cool and antiseptic retreat from Bangkok's oppressive daytime heat: there's places to eat, places to gawp at imprisoned 'wildlife', places to look at goods a-plenty, places to salivate over sexy foreign automobiles that are way outside the price range of the majority of the car voyeurs, and (breathless) somewhere that actually sells a decent range of books! (Kinokuniya) Gosh! (I also like it because I typed my name into the electronic author index and my name naturally appeared - there's nothing quite like a bit of self-indulgence, shameless as it may well be :-) ) I can't bring myself to really recommend the Paragon (a misnomer if ever there was one) because there isn't really anything that sets it apart from other, similar establishments; it's too linear, too architecturally global, and is bereft of style. Okay, I quite understand that many people feel comfortable in places that are more or less there to help one part company with one's money, but at least one may applaud a place that can do it with panache. Paragon emphatically cannot. I also understand that many folks will disagree with my comments. fair enough, that's your prerogative. I suppose it's worth a visit though just to make up your own mind.Anything really positve to report? Yep - the toilets are pretty good."

We live in Bangkok and come here regularly with our two small children. Good for killing time and for escaping the heat. There is a huge Aquarium in the basement, complete with sharks etc. Well worth a visit, even if you've been to lots of these kinds of places before - expensive for tourists (Adults pay 900Baht) but for residents rate it is nearer to 400Baht which is good value.

The top floor featured showrooms for porche, lotus, mini, bmw and ferrari, it also housed True Internet cafe, which featured an apple store, an internet garden, a wall of accessories and more computers than the largest internet cafe. While we were there, there was a big spectacle involving some big name stars which sent hordes of teenagers and adults to scream while scrambling to take pictures. At the same time there was indeed a fashion show going on surrounded by glass displays of beautiful jewelery. All in all it was quite an experience.

Has iMax movies, a 4D theater and many regular theaters with seating ranging from isolated pairs of powered reclining chairs to standard theater seats. If you are looking for lower prices, go to MBK which is a few minutes walk but for quality name brand goods, it is all in Paragon."

Not the newest but still one of the best.The departmental store is Paragon but there are other shops, branded and unbranded, outside the departmental store within the building. All the luxury brands are there including luxury sports cars. Jim Thompson is also situated there, at the back of the building. The ground floor food area is fascinating to visit - all the various little eating outlets serving many types of cuisine and the variety of cakes is amazing. Food is mediocre - you go for the variety and ambience which is pretty 'classy'. One of my favourite restaurants is 'Another Hound', part of the Greyhound chain, which is on a different floor.Gourmet Food Market (supermarket) is also rather posh and stocks many imported items.There is a very large Kinokuniya bookshop on the 3rd floor and cinema/bowling alley on the 5th floor.A huge aquarium called Siam Ocean World is at the basement. It's well kept and lovely to visit but pricey for foreigners. Locals or residents pay local rate showing work permit or Thai driving licence.All in all - a great place to spend the day with lots to do.Take BTS (Sky train) to Siam station.http://www.siamparagon.co.th/v9/index.php"

Adjacent to SIAM BTS Skytrain station. Novotel hotel on Siam Square across street, also a Kimpenski 5 star Hotel on the opposite side. You can stroll around here in air conditioned comfort all day and all night, and not be bored. Best shopping is the Exotic Thailand high quality souvenirs on the 4th or 5th floor of the department store. So many restaurants in all price levels. Have fun!"

There's lots of different animals in here and even the touch pool for the kids to hold some of them. Not cheap, especially as you're in BKK, but as I say, if you've been dragging the kids round the shops (MBK for example), this is a good treat for them (and you) at the end of the day."

The Siam Paragon is very easy to get to using either of the BTS lines and getting off at Siam, the junction station for both lines. Another option is to use the sky walk that links Chit Lom BTS with Siam BTS.Siam Paragon has a great range of international brand names (although prices are not really different to the same items in the main European centres).The entertainment options are significant, certainly something for all the family, including a Madame Tussauds Wax Museum that was very good. The ground floor fountains are also quite entertaining.There are security checks at all entrance points and a helpful directory of all the shops available near the escalators. There is a good range of book stores on the 3rd floor.The newly re-opened Central World Plaza (about 100 metres away via the skywalk) is offering some stiff competition."

As a resident of Thailand, it's fair to say Siam Paragon will have the best representation of international grade top end goods and food (both supermarket and dining) to be found in Thailand under one roof. It's for this reason you may want to overlook the fact there won't be many deals to be had. Bangkok can be a tough place to get around and you could easily burn up days to find what will essentially all be here. If you're looking for deals you'd be better off heading to Seacon Square (recently remodeled) on Sri Nakarin Road, about 150 baht taxi ride from downtown but plan on anywhere from 45 min to 2 hours to get there depending on traffic. Seacon Square is a great place to find wide selection deals under one roof but doesn't really have any high end shops. It's a place where local middle class Thai's will shop.If you're downtown, short on time, in need of shopping and don't want to mess around with copies etc. this is your one stop shop.

Great selection for the traveller. Take time to see the Motor Car dealers - 5th floor! Have been to the cinemas and recommend their premium class. For A$20 you get a drink and snack before the movie - try the massage chair- a recliner chair in a 2 person booth and a movie. And just to help you relax they provide a silk comforter and cushion, Don;t miss this when you go to Bangkok"

It also has perhaps the best super markets in Thailand. "

However the shopping mall is pretty cool where you can go only to this place to enjoy Seaworld, Madame Tussaud, various Thai food in the food court, and other events if you're lucky (there was Japan fest when I went there).The shopping mall is conveniently connected with the sky train. Of course there's a lot of taxi and tuk tuk too, but the area is very very crowded. It is the centre of traffic jam in Bangkok, you'll spent at least 50 bath only to get out/in to the shopping mall drop-off area.I suggest to visit this mall only if you are staying around the area or you really want to go to the Madame Tussaud."

The only downside is if you buy something from a food court stand that does not have seating you are out of luck for seating, there is none for you, because the seating that is there is only for the restaurants that sell the food for that area. Krispy Kreme just opened and the people were lined up and buying 6 or 7 BOXES of donuts!The cineplex on the top floor has 14 theatres plus an IMAX. we got VIP seating, a comfy leather loveseat with a blanket for 600 baht! it was great!great mall!"

The movies are in original language, subtitled in Thai or English. Usually priced at 120 Baht. Can be cheaper or more expensive, depending on time, screen and theater.The 7th floor toilets on the exhibition end are very good. Almost no one there, many clean spacious western toilets. Always soap, towels, paper and no-touch water-taps and big mirrors. Very clean.The 3rd floor Kinokuniya is perhaps the best book store in Bangkok. Highly recommended. The military history, martial arts, philosophy and religion departments are very well presented here. To find similar, one would have to go to Singapore or Kuala Lumpur. The average cost of books is usually 200-500 Baht. Here you can find very specialiced books in English and Thai. Other languages presented too. One floor down is AsiaBooks, which is small but has good gift books.The G (ground) floor has a food-court, many restaurants, internet-cafe, McDonalds etc, but also the great Paragon Gourmet Market, which is basically a big supermarket, with huge and specialized selections. It has it's own liquor and tobacco place also. The prices are not expensive, unless you opt for something rare and imported. I highly recommend.One floor down on the basement is the Siam Paragon Ocean World, which claims to be the largest aquarium in Asia. Very good place to visit also. It is similar to the great aquariums in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.Siam Paragon is situated at the central BTS SkyTrain station, (CEN) Siam. SkyTrain is connected to the MRT subway system. A ticket for either will cost 15-40 Baht. There is a walkway to Central World, and to the other way you can walk to Siam Center, Siam Discovery and all the way to MBK.On the Siam Paragon square outside there are often some happenings like concerts etc.This place is definitely worth a visit if you are on the area and find yourself interested in anything described above. While here you can visit the Madame Toussaud's Wax Cabinet on the nearby Siam Discovery Center's top floor."

There are also free standing restaurants\u2014Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.\u2014along the edges of the bottom floor. Adjacent to the mall on its west side, there are a couple of other smaller malls (Siam Center and Siam Discovery Center) with less expensive clothing stores and fast food restaurants. Due east is the Central World Plaza / Zen Mall, but the majority of it is closed and under reconstruction.

The IMAX on the top floor shows the latest Hollywood production (currently Avatar in 3-D). And in the basement is a pretty decent aquarium, particularly when you think it is located in a shopping mall. Of course, there are also the stores - but they seem to be the lesser attraction here, given that many are the Prada / Gucci / Armani type that I myself don't frequent.

Their garments are beautifully done and look a million dollars! The staff in all shops are outstanding. They actually took care of the kids while we shopped! They smiled and helped and advised us about the vat refunds and how to get them. The major plus in Siam Paragon is the food hall in the basement. A mecca of food, with fantastic stalls with all kind of asian dishes one can wish for. If you feel hungry this is the place to have a value meal. The bakery right there in the middle of the floor does the most delicious cheescake bread ever tasted. I tried to re-create the recipee but that was impossible. Could go to Bangkok just for that!

The station on the sky train network is \"Siam\". This will allow you to enter Siam Center and Siam Paragon. It has so much to see and taste and do. It is not like any shopping malls in the UK, it is great. Had a good wonder about and in the Siam Paragon centre the last floor a hidden tresure of a food court. Oh my god how much food was there, everything you can imagine, well presented and it was so busy. We had a good lunch and shopped on. Round the corner is another shopping mall called MBK Centre, this is for everything electronic, phones, watches, TV, Videos, Games...... you name it. you need to barter to get a good price and use cash not to get charged % fee. That's where I got my chrager in the end. Enjoy spending money...I know I did!!!"

The Ocean world in this shopping mall is a life time experience, as you can watch a 4D theatre movie, travel and see fish in a glass bottom boat and an aquarium tunnel where you can see sharks and much more. Its an up market international standard shopping mall with good prices.Food court is alos great and you can find a wide range to choose from."

            "review": "Siam Paragon is an easily-accessible shopping centre in a good location. First I would just like to point out that the Siam Paragon shopping centre is a completely different shopping centre to MBK. The MBK shopping centre is not as up market as the Siam Paragon and is also very popular with Thai teenagers and most of the clothes, bags and belts etc\u2026 are copies/fakes! Siam Paragon is of international standards and while there are many expensive designer shops, there are also some more reasonable prices to been found. My wife bought some underwear, for example, that she said were high quality and good value too!The BTS goes right to the door so getting there is easy. If you are visiting the nearby Siam Centre, Siam Discovery Centre or the MBK Centre you can walk pretty much all the way through them to get to Siam Paragon Centre. Across the road is an area of shops, restaurants and bars/clubs called Siam Square, which is popular with young Thais.The Siam Paragon Shopping Centre has lots of good features but my favourite one has to be the Siam Ocean World on the bottom floor. This was a very interesting look under-the-sea with lots to look at. On the way out I held a big Lizard on my arm for a photo too!"

            "review": "Good mall, bad prices. This is a huge mall, selling almost everything. However, so many tourists visit it that prices are inflated by up to 10 times. Also, it is impossible to get a taxi around SIAM Paragon and MBK without getting totally ripped off. I highly recommend taking the BTS (the sky-train) on your way back.I'm not saying you cannot get a deal. Mobile phones are well-priced, so is mostly anything in the very small stores. Jeans are good quality and around 1000 Baht (compared to Pratunam where denim jeans can be bought for 150 Baht).Also, I personally had a bad experience at SIAM/MBK. I was treated with a smile and as soon as I asked for a discount (I said, \"Oh come on, give me a good price\"), suddenly her face changed and she was angry. She turned her back on me and started touting people walking outside her store. This is at a jeans store on the main floor of MBK. To me, it seems SIAM Paragon/MBK is a good mall if you want to walk around and see the wares (and pay near-American/European prices), but not good if you're looking for a good deal. The sellers here are a bit spoiled due to the influx of tourists. I recommend checking out Pratunam or Chatuchak."

            "review": "Maybe the best mall in the WORLD.... To escape the mid-day Bangkok heat, head for Siam Paragon. This mall makes any U.S. or European mall look like NOTHING, really nothing at all. The movie theaters are probably the most luxurious in the world, with incredibly deluxe and spacious seating, with food and champagne service, lounges, etc. There is even an OPERA house on the top floor. I like the food court on the lower level the best... hundreds of choices, amazing variety, and reasonable prices too. Also a wide choice of full service restaurants. Virtually every major designer has a big store here, and car dealers too. Large boookstores (the Kinoyama ? is the best). There is a BTS elevated high speed train station adjacent (Siam Square stop), with two lines there, right in the center of the City. If you want to spend the night, there is a Novotel very close by, maybe 3 minutes walking. There are other large shopping malls nearby: the Central Plaza, even bigger, but not as nice as Siam Paragon; M.B.K. is close by, and best for bargain hunters. Adjacent to Siam Paragon is Siam Center and Siam Discovery Center. Around a very large block, or a 10 minute taxi ride, is Pantip Plaza shopping area, for electronics, computers, cheap movies, etc. The supermarket in the basement is amazing... what a selection, and reasonably prices... you can buy for example, a can of Campbell's soup, made in the U.S.A. for LESS MONEY than you pay for the same thing... IN THE U.S.A... it's true. The Ocean Aquarium in the basement is supposed to be Asia's finest. Siam Paragon makes even Singapore's malls look rather dreary and small. There is always some kind of event or entertainment going on there or just outside too, day and night. For those on a budget, Soi Kasesam nearby, across from MBK Center, has many cheap hotels and guesthouses."

More dedicated watch company boutique stores than any place i have seen. even IWC has its own store. Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, all have dealerships inside this mall. In fact, one could call this the Ferrari of shopping malls. The food halls in basement are worth the trip alone. There is also a pretty decent aquarium in the basement."

There's a full scale oceanarium in the basement, a never-ending food hall, an indoor lake, omni-max theatre, cineplex, exhibition/conference halls, dual-floor gym, Ferrari showroom, not to mention acres and acres of shops and more shops. All this and more packed in one 7-storey building. I've never seen anything quite like it in Asia. This could probably be the best. You can easily spend a whole day here and still not complete everything. Make sure you wear comfy walking shoes. And don't forget that GPS, just in case you get lost!"
