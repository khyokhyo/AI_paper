            "review": "Dutch Courage during WWII. We had been to resistance museums in other European countries that suffered Nazi occupation, and this museum rated among the best. Very good audio guides are available in multiple languages, at no extra charge. The exhibits and the commentary give a picture of what the Dutch people endured at the hands of the Nazis. It was interesting to learn that some Dutch people thought that since Hitler had done a good job of turning the German economy around, that he could possibly do the same for them. Also, I had not considered that Dutch colonies in Indonesia suffered at the hands of the Japanese during the war. Overall, a great experience. We went midday and there were no lines. Very polite and helpful staff."

It's an amazing collection, that gives an idea and a feeling of the challenges and difficulties of war without being depressing but often uplifting. Great for adults and children"

We felt that we would get a better overview and understanding of what it was like to live in Holland and Amsterdam during WWII. It was an excellent experience. The Junior section was incredible, walking you through the virtual experienceserver of real victims from the war. It was very thought provoking and soul searching. ALLOW ENOUGH TIME.

            "review": "Interesting, well presented and focussed exhibition. This museum looks at the average Dutch person's experience when adjusting to Nazi occupation during WWII, and seems like a natural accompaniment to the Anne Frank Museum. It is laid out well and remains very focussed and interesting throughout, constantly coming back to the dilemma it lays out right at the start: To adapt, collaborate, or resist. It does a good job of giving context to the overarching events, while taking the time to tell some very personal stories which offer differing points of view.The ticket price (\u20ac10 adult) includes a free audio guide, which is a nice touch, and I found this to be a useful accompaniment to the exhibit, though my wife quickly grew tired of it and didn't use it. It repeated a lot of what was written on the displays, but also gave specific guidance around the collection of exhibits.Overall a very well presented exhibit told competently, and perhaps illuminating a side of a well-known story that you may not have thought too much about before. There is apparently 90 mins worth of recorded audio on the audio guide, which is probably a good amount of time to get around the museum. Also there was a section at the back that was sign posted as being for juniors, though I didn't go in here."

I have been to several WWII museums and while they are all interesting, I appreciated that this museum took a different look at the war and talked about both Jewish people and Non Jews alike. Having Jewish friends and neighbors and knowing what was happening you had two choices, help them or mind your own business and protect yourself. This is not only an exhibit on WWII but also human nature. Very interesting!"

This totally opened my eyes to the plight of occupied Europe during WWII espesially the plight of the people of Netherlands, I was expecting stories of sabotage and brave undercover missions similer to how Hollywood and other media have shown the French Resistences role during WWII, but this was very very different it asks the question from the veiw of the ordinary family how would you act ? what would you do ? You've been invaded ! you're now occupied by a forigen army ! Do you sit back and accept the nazis rule or do you resist any way you can that will hinder the German war effort ?

This is an incredible museum, and for me and my children (aged 8 and 10) put the extraordinary experience of visiting Anne Frank's house the day before into it's wider context. At the resistance museum you learn about the experience of he occupation for Dutch people more broadly, as well as the huge number of Jewish citizens who suffered and died (60,000 from Amsterdam alone). The junior section of the museum is the best children's museum I have ever been to - my 8 and 10 year old were so completely engaged and absorbed we couldn't leave until they had watched and opened and listened to everything. I found the whole thing incredibly moving and they certainly learned a huge amount."

You'll learn how real people responded, and what the consequence of their choice was, and you'll think about what you'd do in similar situations. Amazing experience."

I do not pretend to tell you that you must go here about the Anne Frank House, Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh museum or Red Light District. But if you have seen the mainstays, this is a worthwhile 2 hours to spend.The museum takes you thought the history of how the Dutch dealt with German occupation during the war. There is a lot of great detail and storytelling at the museum. There are also not a lot of places to sit. This museum is tiring with its detail from the audio tour to the exhibit descriptions. I left with a much greater appreciation for the history of the Netherlands in WWII, but also tired and needing a long sit in the cafe next door (worth going to for tea!).Bottom line, for longer trips to Amsterdam, go here... for quick trips, this may not rise to the right level.On a side note, the museum is directly across from the Zoo and around the corner from the Dutch Holocaust Museum."

Its impact is not to be denied and they have done a materful and unforgettable job of telling the story of the Dutch Resistance during WWI. The Audioguides are an integral part of the story as they provide additional detail and background to the movement during this 1 \u00bd hour history lesson. This museum needs to be included in your list of museums in The Netherlands not to miss."

The Verzets isn't much different; it features a detailed, remarkably objective walk through the history of the German occupation of the Netherlands during WW2, highlighting the social and political causes, consequences, and dilemmas of the Dutch people, as relevant today as they were then. Aware of the semantic charge, I can say I very much \"enjoyed\" this museum; not only for the wealth of its collection and its important message, but especially for the comprehensive way in which it is presented."

That was nonsense as a lady on the desk eventually got us in by ringing her office who confirmed they had had an email confirming our booking.

I went with four friends and we all found it interesting, but a bit overwhelming. The exhibit rooms wind from one to the other. We wondered if that design was intended to give one a claustrophobic feeling, somewhat like the closed-in feeling that the Dutch must have had during the war. As a result, we all decided to forego seeing the entire museum because it was overwhelming. The exhibits are well designed although they present a lot of information and require considerable reading. An added feature is the pleasant restaurant with outdoor seating. I would go back again because this topic is important, but it is a bit intense."

The 'verzetsmuseum' is a small collection of items that evoke the occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany from 1940-45, and in particular the resistance against the occupation. An important part of this were attempts to rescue Jews from being deported and killed (the museum is located in what used to be a heavily Jewish neighborhood, which also hosts two synagogues and a memorial to those murdered, the 'Hollandse Schouwburg' right around the corner), but also politically motivated resistance by young and brash people, communists and socialists. Among other things the resistance carried out what was called 'terrorist attacks' on Nazi officials and Dutch collaborators, admittedly with mixed results but interesting for the analogy with what happens in other places under stress."

Whilst it's a city full of vibrancy and colour, a free and exuberant city that welcomes all peoples, it also had a dark period which should be understood to fully appreciate what is here now. The museum covers the occupation years in a lot of depth with many photos, letters and memorabilia from that time. It's an unfortunate period in Amsterdam's history, but one that should be seen. A worthwhile visit."

Very interesting the written words (appreciated the dual translation (to English) and the memorabilia. Sad to see the photos, the humanistic toughness touches you. So sad the stories of escape, survival, death, betrayal ... Similar in emotional response as a Holocaust museum, the evolution from late 1930s to mid 1940s is something we (may) know but reading and seeing real 'period' things is something different; quite an experience!A serious matter previously but in today's current time we should remember this as there could be some similarities."

It made me wonder if my ancestors had similar experiences with Yankees during the Civil War. 2) Another woman who named her baby after the Queen in exile was imprisoned after placing a thank you in the paper for all the gifts people had sent her after they had seen the birth announcement.

I felt like you could really get a sense of what it must have been like, and how the citizens were grappling with what to do as the occupation turned more and more restrictive, dangerous, and adversarial. I spent about three to four hours here but you could probably do it in less time if you wanted. The audio guide is useful and well done; nice to have one that actually functions properly at all stages of the museum. The entrance fee of 10 euros per adult was well worth it, I thought.

There was a mix of video, audio, picture, written word and exhibits. All on one level (there is a video to view on the first floor but it's also screened on the ground floor prior to entering the main exhibition area). Entrance is only 10 euros for adults. There were no queues so you don't feel rushed to move around the exhibition area. Very educational and thought provoking, worth a visit."

As before I think it's one of the best in Amsterdam, loads of content and it really does give good context as to what it was like to the resistance during the war.The audio guide (which is included in the price \u20ac10 for an adult) is very simple to use. Simply point at the small green squares located throughout the museum.There was an interesting exhibition on also with some very nice large canvas print photographs regarding how we in the present day treat the war. Really an added bonus.Would encourage anyone to come."

It was fascinating to learn the history of that and to read the personal stories of how that affected not only individuals but the country as a whole. It was scary and chilling the way the Nazis first started their persecution of the Jews. It was one of those slippery slope things that just kept getting worse and worse. The vast majority of the displays are in Dutch and English. There is also a free audio guide you can use for your specific language. I spent 2.5 hours there and never got to the junior resistance and former colony of the Dutch East Indies during WW ll sections. Having been to both the Anne Frank house and this museum, my advice is if you only have time to see one of them this is definitely the one to go to. During our visit on July 31, 2016, we attended the story teller of Amsterdam, Karel Baracs', presentation/story \" Why tram 8 no longer runs.\" It was excellent and brought tears to my eyes. He is scheduled through the end of August for this so check out the museums website for dates and times."

If you teach ANYTHING related to history, literature, world events, social idealism, political activism, etc from students aged eight-up, then this museum is a MUST visit. It will tear at your soul, rip at your heart, and open your eyes in one fell swoop. Located across the street from the huge Artis Zoo, it is easily accessed via tram 14, tram 9, or bus 22. I highly recommend this museum! NOTE: If you require reading glasses, please make sure you bring them. The bulk of this museum is in Dutch. The easy-to-use audio guide is in English, but there are many signs on the wall or in the window-box displays that have the information written in large print in Dutch and in smaller print for English.

The museum does an outstanding job at presenting the Dutch experience and it is chilling to see actual Nazi posters and orders of deportation as well as learn about the cruelty and starvation the Dutch and particularly the Dutch Jewish people endured in WW2. The happy and sad stories of life before, during and after WW2 are told in a way that you will not forget.On your way there or back don't forget to take note that it is located across the street from where the civil registry building was destroyed by Dutch resistance to keep the information on where Jewish persons lived in the city from the Nazis. You will also be around the corner from an old Jewish neighbourhood including the theatre that was used as a central depot for those rounded up by Nazis before they were taken out of the city."

Most information is available in Dutch and English, and there are audio guides available in many languages. The introductory film is worth watching and sets up the theme of the museum."

During that visit I spent 4 hours there and did not finish seeing the museum. It was one of the highlights of my trip- although the subject is not pleasant, it provided a good understanding of the humanity of the citizens of the Netherlands during a very difficult time in history. This trip, my husband's first, I was anticipating sharing the museum with him and finishing the visit. Much to my disappointment, approximately half the museums space had been dedicated to a section for youth. In order to accomplish this approximately half of the adult section had been removed. The museum now provided a very superficial overview of this very important movement. I was finished seeing it in less than 90 minutes."

While the museum is well done (and the self-guided tour comprehensive) I think I was expecting to learn more about resistance efforts, of which there were few. There were some examples, primarily efforts of single individuals, and some interesting stories, such as a baby that got sent to a concentration camp because her parents named her after Dutch royalty and this created a buzz. I'd recommend a visit, just think of it as a WWII history museum."

It has very detailed and interesting stories from many aspects of the occupation--things I'd never heard of or seen before. It's an interactive place, it has a great (free!) audio guide, but I ended up giving up on it after a bit, mostly because I just prefer reading at my own pace rather than listening along. But many others used the audioguide straight through, I noticed. The nice thing about this museum being vastly underrated is that it's not very crowded. We went around 1030 or 11am on a weekday and while there were a few others there it wasn't crowded at all. That's always nice when you're reading lots of exhibits. We could easily have spent 3 hours there! However we were crunched for time, so after spending about an hour and 45min in the main exhibit, we had to go. We did duck into the \"juniors\" section for a moment to look at one of the 4 stories of children who lived through the occupation. It reminded me a lot of Daniel's Story at the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC (in a good way). Recommend this stop!"

We did the self guided tour, without the English audio, all of the exhibits were written in Dutch and English, so that meant reading quite a bit.

Follow the paths of 4 children - one Jew, one nazi sympathizer, one who is son of resister/clergy and one mesmerized by the excitement of war. You learn their stories through a remarkable and creative exhibit. Then to meet these people through interviews at the end and their fate. 4 children, 4 different positions of war and all damaged by their own situations. No one wins even when it seems some on the winning team. The creativity in putting this exhibit together is just amazing. Also was a photography special exhibit that was quite poignant.

The museum is designed to make you think about how you would react in the same situation. The permanent exhibition is laid out in a chronological fashion, with period items, videos, audio recordings, and first person accounts. The exhibition is engrossing and is difficult to ignore a single item.The temporary exhibit at the time of my visit was a photography exhibition about the Second World War today. It features images of veterans meeting together at battle sites, volunteers searching for the remains of soldiers, re-enactors spending their weekends in uniform, and people visiting concentration and extermination camps.I spent far longer in the museum than I originally intended, but it was certainly worth it."

We visited this museum a couple of days after doing a walking tour of the city that focused on the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam. This museum gives a fascinating, sobering, and complete picture of what is was like for the people of Amsterdam, both Jewish and non-Jewish, when the city was occupied by the Nazis during the war. You cannot leave without feeling overwhelmed and moved by their experiences. It also makes you appreciate what freedom means and that it is something no one should take for granted."

It gives a plethora of information about world war 2, the Danish resistance, and does so in an entertaining and empathetic way. We spent at least two hours listening to the audio tour and we probably could've spent another two if we go had come back after lunch. We ate at the cafe next door and it was great. I have a gluten allergy and they made me a sandwich in gluten free bread. Even adults should really check out the junior museum as it is really well done. Compared to the Anne Frank house, this museum was much more comprehensive and gave much more of the bigger picture of the Dutch and their role and reactions to the war. I am conflicted about recommending the junior museum for young kids. The stories of four children are compelling, and yet could be very scary for kids. It all depends when you want them to learn about the horrors of the holocaust. In the main museum there is a big picture of a pile of bones from a concentration camp so I think the main museum is for sure too overwhelming for a child or young adult. I would consider bringing my ten year kid who knows about the Holocaust to the junior side but not my 8 year old. I did see very young children on the junior side. Maybe European children learn about it earlier than Americans. But for adults the whole place is a can't miss. It's slightly off the beaten track, but public trams are very easy to take (the bus stop was Artis). Get their when it opens at 10 and you will have a head start before the school groups get there and make it a bit more crowded."

Not being Dutch, the resistance movement was not important to me, and seeing how most of Amsterdam was not destroyed during the war, I was bored to be honest. There are audio guides available at the front desk, and you return them once you finish walking through on a stand near the restroom. Not a bad place, just not super exciting.The museum is directly across from the zoo, which I would have preferred to go to."

I recommend visiting this museum before you visit the Anne Frank House, because you will have a better understanding of the sacrifices which were made by the people who sheltered the Frank family and the others who were in hiding with them. We found the staff here quite helpful. We intended to purchase our Museumkaart tickets here, but they had only one ticket (There were two of us.), and the person responsible for the tickets was in a meeting. We were allowed to enter with one ticket and then returned to the reception desk later to purchase the other ticket. I believe that they went out of their way to accommodate us, since the museum was closing in 1 1/2 hours when we arrived. We are normally NOT directionally challenged, but we had a difficult time finding this museum. The best advice is that it is across the street from the entrance to the zoo."

You do get an audio player included though. IMPRESSIONSThe map before you enter the museum suggests it is small and you do one big loop, in actual fact there are many \"side rooms\" which you can easily get lost from and dates can get mixed up easily too. A better guidance system is needed. Considering how long it actually was, there were no seats and only 4 grab-and-take seats outside to be taken in. In this instance it didn't feel fair to take these seats away from those who needed more but after a long day walking anyway, I needed somewhere to plant myself half way round and round nowhere. There was an amazing photographic gallery which explores the WW2 for the younger generations. It considers that museums and memorials etc Aushwitz are no longer deemed as symbols to remember and think of those involved, but just a day out and tourist attraction. It also looks at reinactments of the war and deems it disrespectful that people are using the war as a reason to play and have fun. This was a thought provoking exhibition which has planted something significant in my mind. AMENITIES There are toilets I believe, but I never found them. A cafe near the entrance which is also accessible from the front street. Lockers for your bigger bags and a book for your opinions."

The museum then does an excellent job of presenting the consequences of each of these choices. The choice to resist was certainly a dangerous one and the bravery and ingenuity of the citizens who followed this path is to be respected and admired. All citizens of the world must be mindful of stereotypes and the demonization of entire groups of people.

The children's exhibit was especially hood we thought for adults and children alike. It was hands on and followed the experiences of 4 (real) children and their families. It also provided mock ups of houses where people were hidden (many people needed to be hidden, not only People of the Jewish faith) and encouraged interaction with the dilemmas faced by citizens. The entry fee includes an audio set which provided excellent coverage of the exhibits. This was a really good museum that brought the problems faced by Dutch citizens to a level of realism."

When visiting Amsterdam it is easy to get tunnel vision and she the Anne Frank museum as the only insight into those troubling times. The Resistance Museum offers a wider look into one of the darkest times in modern history. There is a degree of overlap, and how could there not be, but one of the strengths of this museum is in showing the little ways in which the general public rebeled, resisted and otherwise assisted Jews, the Allies and made things difficult for the occupying forces. A very worthy place to visit.The Musuem was also hosting a temporary Children's exhibit. Warning! This exhibit can break you. Detailing the fate of trains full of children shipped from Amsterdam to Sobibor, it is almost too successful in personalising this atrocity; which almost lends itself to abstraction through the massive figures.

It explains the Nazi occupation and the reactions of the Dutch in 3 differnt ways. Some chose to be collaborators, others to passively accept, and many to resist the Nazis. While many picture captions are in Dutch we found there was enough English to explain what was happening in each. The bravery and strength of many of the citizens was remarkable! Those that joined the Nazi's didn't fare so well. This will take you about 1 1/2 hours to enjoy. If you get an opportunity, go to Arnhem and see the museum there too!"

I visited this museum as a maths teacher on a school trip with a bunch of disaffected 13 year old girls who were not happy at the thought of another museum. We had a tour starting with a film and the whole experience was amazing. The guide (they all spoke perfect English) had our girls enthralled, desperate to answer his questions, to ask questions of their own, and to know everything he had to tell them. I myself am rather disinterested in history but found his explanations deeply affecting and have thought about the museum a lot since then. I plan to visit Amsterdam to take my own daughter there when I can.As an aside... While we were visiting I decided that a girl on the trip needed hospital care for an injury she had sustained earlier. The museum called us a taxi, and one of the guides, Marjon, came to the hospital with us to translate. She stayed with us, teaching us Dutch, for the several hours we were at the hospital, and then helped us to find the rendezvous with our tour coach. Whether that says more about the Dutch people or the museum staff I'll leave it to you to decide, but I was bowled over..."

The displays are detailed, though occasionally I found reading the font a little difficult, but the audio guide helped with this. Occasionally the route round was a little confusing.

The separate exhibit for children was top-rate as well: not pandering, but real engagement with how children might think and feel about the events of that time. I was very impressed by the museum's choice to follow the fates of four real people who were children during the war. The parents of these four children made very different political choices (or had choices forced on them) and the children felt the impact of those choices and fates. We see details of the children's lives and hear their stories, and in a final exhibit, we meet them again as elderly people, talking about how the war changed their lives. Fantastic."

You're not just hearing the story, you feel like you're living it. I can't tell you how many times I got goosebumps while walking through.

Museums similar to this often fail on two grounds, they have a tendency to ignore the fact that much of the population either collaborates or at least takes the course of least resistance and they fail to make visitors think about what they would have done if faced with the same question. Chile's famed museum of the resistance to the dictatorship is a classic example, after two hours you're still none the wiser about why 45% of the population voted to keep the dictatorship.This museum takes a very wise course, building the exhibition around the central premise; would you resist, collaborate or muddle through? It\u2019s also honest enough to admit that many public officials really felt that the best thing they could do was to stay in office rather than resign and be replaced by Nazi's. It tracks very accurately how as the occupation wore on and the measures being taken against the Jews (and others) became more and more harsh this middle way eventually became impossible. It also doesn't shy away from the fact that the Dutch Nazi party had over 100,000 members at its peak and that much of civil society co-operated with laws such as registering Jewish owned businesses which could only have been designed with one purpose in mind.I would strongly recommend it, even to those with a familiarity with the topic. When I visited it was reassuringly busy with visitors of all ages which is all one can ask."

The museum\u2019s aim is to analyse how everyday people coped with the Nazi occupation in Holland by looking at examples of those who resisted, adjusted and collaborated with the regime. The museum does this through the use of videos, interactive exhibits, diaries, newspaper clippings, artefacts and more- making for a comprehensive and multi-sensory exhibition. At the end of the museum there is also exhibition that focuses on government bias in the media by looking mainly at the Dutch Colonial Wars in Indonesia, but parallels are also drawn to media reporting of conflicts today. I found the museum really interesting and liked the way it provokes important moral questions and issues for you to consider as well as educating you on an extremely important part of history. The museum itself costs 10 euros for adults and comes with a free audio tour. The staff are extremely friendly, welcoming and helpful- they seemed to genuinely want to help you get the most out of the museum. I'd definitely recommend."

This story of wartime resistance is a beacon of hope during dark times both then and now, as it can't fail to make you reflect on human and inhuman nature, fear, manipulation and ego. It's easy to think this is from the past but it continues to play out somewhere in the world right now and in it's powerful provision of food for thought, you'd need to be pretty hard-nosed not to to be affected by the theme of this collection of stories, told from all sides.Run by volunteers, the welcome and helpful advice shared to ensure you receive the most from your visit is second to none. Do take the free audio guide; the access it gives to more information, brought to meaningful life, will leave you impressed by the thought given to the selection of information and materials displayed in a way that intrigues and teaches so well. The best curated collection of information I've seen on this trip and I'd suggest this as a perfect partner visit to the Anne Frank House, which has been conserved as best as is practically possible. Here you get so much of relevance to the wider story.Allow plenty of time to view. The amount of information is enormous but never daunting as it draws you to want to know more, rather than overwhelming you - and you have control over how much information you want to access or give greater emphasis to. There is a whole special exhibition for the younger ones and an additional display too.In terms of content, interest, affectation, enjoyment and value this tops my list of visits. I've paid far more plus extra for an audio guide to look at a collection of beautiful 'stuff' that seemed so fickle and self indulgent, beyond demonstrating true merit of the artist. This, by complete contrast, seems significant in a truly human context and I would suggest the museum increases it's admission fee or have a clear collection point for donations. Well done to all concerned. I shall be returning but not alone."

I knew very little about the Dutch Resistance during WW2 so decided to pop into this 'little' museum, intending to spend an hour in there to warm up and in terms of Amsterdam museums it was cheap.We went at 2pm and got around half way through the museum (there are four areas) and before we knew it we were being told the museum was closing so we would have to leave - we had been there three hours without even feeling anywhere close to that. So we paid and went back again the next morning intending to spend no more than an hour there just to finish our visit and we spent another three hours there. Definitely take the audioguide - it is very very good and gives you the option to listen in more detail to personal stories if that's what you enjoy, which I do.Don't be put off by the 'junior museum' if you an adult - it is not only for children and we spent a good amount of time in there. It tells the story of four Dutch children through the war, including reconstructions of their houses which you can walk through such as where a Jewish girl hid - they're actually very realistic. And we had no children with us. This was very much a highlight of our trip.The exhibition about the Colonial Wars is also very very good, Very honest and direct, which adds to it. It is really harrowing, but also very informative because I honestly knew nothing about the wars until the visit. The whole museum is very thought provoking and when looking for things to do in Amsterdam I don't feel like it's given enough credit. It does give you a lot to think about, posing questions to you such as what would you do during the German occupation? Staff are also very very helpful when you have any questions. I would recommend to everyone, and despite my two visits in as many days, I wouldn't hesitate to return."

A very well laid out museum which flows in a chronological method, assessing Dutch lifestyles throughout the thirties, leading into the threat of war and the subsequent invasion. Very, very informative with terrific attention to detail of the key points. Incredibly thought provoking with the right degree of emphasis placed on the menace and brutality of living under the Nazi regime. There is also a section of the museum dedicated to the Dutch Colonial War of the late 40's which proves a fascinating insight into a conflict which is not widely acknowledged or discussed.The museum also has a section dedicated for children which looks at the occupation from the perspective of four different children.Very engaging museum and a must for anybody wishing to learn about this period of time from a Dutch perspective."

First bit quite straightforward is around how the Dutch coped with German occupation in WW2. Very good audio here and I really enjoyed actual recordings from real people involved, from all walks of life. 2nd part is about the end of the Dutch Colony of East Indies. This I had not realised at all (we all tend to focus on WW2 a bit). Basically only a few days after Japan surrendered and got out of Indonesia the Dutch then had another fight on their hands. And it took till 1949 before they gave it up and the new Republic was formed. So well done, again this had great tales from real people involved."

The only complaint I have, and it is a big one, it that the museum needs to spend the money to redo ALL the didactics (labels) since they are poorly done, in small print and often badly located to read w/o stooping. Since the museum is all about information, that information should be well presented. Absolutely use the audio tour."

There is, mercifully, no gift shop, just a few books in Dutch and English and the compulsory Ann Frank volume too of course.The museum itself will take you longer than you might have thought to go through. The explanations are all in English and Dutch and an audio guide is available. It's a very thoughtful and interesting exhibition which delves quite deeply into the political philosophies of the time. If you\u2019re interested in Dutch and European history and how the EU has developed from the socialist policies of 1940s Germany, because that\u2019s what the z in nazi stood for, then you\u2019ll find this museum very thought provoking. There\u2019s a poster in the museum that commemorates the anniversaries 1673-1943 and shows a Dutch man of war and a German U Boat heading towards England. The Dutch smashed the English at the Battles of Schooneveld off the Dutch coast on two June days in 1673, thus saving Holland from a British/French invasion. This poster is a 1943 call to the Dutch to rise up and invade England.The museum is full of interesting little historical anecdotes and memories such as that. There is much here beneath the surface! Those who wear reading glasses should bring them."

If you really want a comprehensive account of how the Netherlands were dealt with by the Nazis and how the Dutch coped, this museum is a must. Get the best out of it with a free audio device to amplify the exhibitions/photos you will see. I was very moved by the Dutch bravery and defiance."

Having visited most of the other larger museums in past travels and not really familiar with this neighborhood we went to check it out. The staff were great and helpful. The exhibits themselves were interesting although a bit dull after a while. Using the listening devices at the stations was helpful in learning about how the war and Amsterdam played together. Glad to have checked it out, and probably if I ever return to that area of the city will be to go to the Zoo across the street."

The kids ruled out art and having spent time viewing a number of museums about World War II in Germany we decided this would be a great 'underground' view of the non-fighting side of the war. There is a great mini movie introducing the museum and idea of \"collaborate, resist or adapt\" for civilians during the war. The museum also had a junior interactive area covering 4 children's lives during the war suited for children aged 8-12. Our 10 year old happily spent her time here, leaving us free to view the adult area. Audio guides were included in admission and there were good English explanations alongside the majority of displays which included Priests' sermons, underground newspapers, letters.Out it on the list. There is a restaurant for a coffee stop at the end."

It is not bad but not outstanding neither.My little girl feels bored so we took her to the children section. OMG, it is amazing. The children section is set as a little village, with 4 houses living with 4 children. Each child has a different background - one Dutch boy, one Jewish girl, one girl whose family supported the German, and one Dutch boy whose father helps the Jewish and other Dutch in needed.Each house is then filled up with interactive subjects, i.e. drawers of kitchen can be opened, it then showed an object to tell anecdotes etc. There is even a little remake of schools, a priests altar, an fighter plane etc. The whole place are \"touchable\" and so much fun for adults too.The stories are told from the eyes of the child when they were little. At the end there are videos showing what they are now, and their thinking about the past. No judgement, no prejudice, but to let the viewers think.I didn't go to Anne Frank museum for fear of the queue. But this museum gives us a chance to see what are the people at that time, from different backgrounds, their thoughts and acts had made up the history.Call first to make sure the children section is open to public. Staff warn us that at some days the children section is only open to school visits and close to public.Buy the book of the children section. My kids love reading the stories of the four kids again and again."

As the Dutch period of resistance lasted all of five days before the Germans took over we expected this would be a short visit! In fact, we spent an enjoyable two hours, and that was without the time we could have spent in the modern extension on the post-World War II colonial conflicts. There is a free audio guide, lots of contemporary war exhibits, and it covered the dilemma of do you collaborate, acquiesce, or resist when war comes to town, very well indeed. Not recommended for young children who like 'hands-on' activities as insufficient exhibits to entertain them but good for older ppl and adults who are interested in the Dutch war perspective.

Tickets are fairly priced and they have a (new?) extension to the museum for kids. They provide a free audio tour guide for the whole museum which will come in really handy as most of the information will be from the recordings. The audioguide can easily top 2 hours of content. Although there is alot of information on the Dutch in WWII, the information is delivered sloppily. Panels are thrown all over the place and they expect visitors to know their way through the labyrinthine museum. A nice restaurant/cafe can be found right next to the museum, offering quick sandwiches and drinks. Cloakroom and wifi are available, but do bring along a 2e coin for the cloakroom (you will get it back after using it)."

The staff were very friendly in letting us know that it was closing, but they still didn't make us feel rushed. He just suggested to not do the audio tour because it would take too long. It is laid out in chronological order which makes it very easy to understand. The information was well written and in depth (and in both English and Dutch). The museum itself is very interesting to walk around and look it. Lots of interactive parts. Overall we left with a very good understanding of the Resistance. We were able to understand the reasons why people joined, and why some people didn't. It's a museum with a different perspective. Lots of anecdotes from survivors of the war. Overall 10/10, fantastic experience. Just go before 4!"

This coupled with free audio pods (which weren't necessary as everything was translated into English) meant that it was easy to listen and examine the exhibits at the same time and created a story in the mind as we travelled around the museum. We got so caught up we lost track of time and after 2 and a bit hours found ourselves rushing to hear the stories of children who had parents with different beliefs at this time and the impact it had on their lives and outlook, (all of who are still alive today). I would recommend this museum for adults and children (from about 9 up) or split the family up with younger children going to the zoo ( just over the road) and the older ones joining them later after they have experienced the museum. The very helpful staff recommend 3 + hours and from our experience this seems about right. "

The museum explores the many ways in which people resisted the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in a frank and open way. When I was visiting, the museum was also hosting an exhibition exploring individuals' stories about the Holocaust as researched by students. This was well constructed and moving. The final section I visited was about the Dutch East Indies, whilst interesting to learn more about the non-European parts of the second world war I did find it hard to relate to this section.

The exhibits are mostly documentary in nature and whilst there are descriptive notes/info from the audio tour with them you cannot fully appreciate them if you don't speak Dutch. The flow of the museum is chronological with side rooms on specific issues, e.g. the jews and the railway workers. Whilst I found the museum interesting I feel the experience could have been enhanced if you were given a brief overview document of the story when you entered the museum and a small map showing what section was which. Personally I would have liked there to be more on the general resistance to the Nazis, what there was felt a bit niche. It would have help if the lighting level was increased thereby making it easier to read some the descriptors."

The museum is well laid out and has a lot of information ranging from from late 1930s before the war through to the liberation in 1945. Including many interesting stories from people that were involved. At 10eur, the entrance price is one of the cheaper ones in Amsterdam (the museums are all very expensive) and the very comprehensive audio guide was included in the entrance price. Free storage lockers too (2eur deposit you get back). Worth a visit if you want to understand more about the history."

The story of The Netherlands under Nazi Occupation is not a widely known WWII history, so this museums offers a fresh perspective and a slightly different angle to histories from, for example, France or Poland. The museum is a little linear, but does an excellent job in introducing visitors to the subject. Dutch Resistance was certainly more benign than in some other European countries but no less admirable and the museum describes the situation throughout the war very well. Lots of primary sources and artifacts, and a broad understanding of what constitutes 'resistance' which is fascinating. Certainly worth a visit if you're a History Buff"

After seeing numerous World War II museums they can start to feel the same but this was is very different. This museum focuses on the experience of the Dutch specifically. With the Dutch, they were fixed to surrender early and suddenly. After that, the Germans occupied the country but wanted the Dutch to join with the Germans in the fight. So rather than sending the people to terrible work camps, they were nice to the Dutch, giving some freedoms. This is where the whole theme of the museum shines. The museum breaks down into three options, assimilate with the Germans, adjust your everyday life around the new restrictions, or rebel against the Germans. From here, all stories are told in one of those 3 contexts. It's a very fascinating way to tell the stories and the museum is very interactive. My wife and I stayed 3 hours and that's only because we only prepaid for 3 hours of parking!"

Amsterdam with its marvelous museums, comfortable restaurants, ease of getting around, by walking or taking the trams, and ever friendly residents to offer directions and recommendations, is a most amiable city. That makes the German occupation in World War Two that more frightening: how a once neighboring country became an occupier, than an oprpessor, then a ogre. But Germany did, and all needs to be reminded of the horror, This museum documents the awful days, Not as dramatic as the Anne Frank House , which tells the story through agifted, sensitive child who was so needlessly killed only weeks before liberation, but the Resistance gives that tour a needed context. It lends Amsterdam a needed history to appreciate it more, and not incidentally make the city's nefarious Red Light district such a contradiction. Contradictions abound."

Everything was very well laid-out, with all text in Dutch and English (We took audio guides but didn't really need them in the end). Mostly focuses on occupied Holland, but there is a smaller section devoted to Dutch Indonesia under the Japanese near the end which was also very good. Some fascinating artefacts like the bicycle with a scooter's front wheel demonstrating the rubber shortages. As a British visitor it was surreal seeing air raid displays - which we are very used to of course thanks to the Luftwaffe!! - and remembering that it was Allied bombings they were afraid of following the rapid German conquest."

It is an easy and lovely walk from the main tourist zone (red light etc.), past the botanic gardens and through a leafy green residential neighborhood featuring a quiet canal side park. The museum building is of modern design. The admission fee is modest and they offer free audio tour headsets, which I recommend since they offer additional information beyond what you will find on the display placards, such as individual personal stories.This museum follows the chronological and social history of the Dutch resistance to Nazi occupation in WWII. It is a fascinating look at the agonizing decisions each Dutch citizen faced as they dealt with the mounting restrictions imposed by the Nazi regime. This museum is an excellent companion visit to the Anne Frank house, to give a more complete picture of the Dutch experience in WWII. The displays are more about information rather than artifacts, although there are some fascinating personal items to look at, along with newspaper clippings, propaganda films, and secret devices like homemade crystal radios hidden in matchboxes etc. There is a junior section geared for children. I think younger children might find the main area boring since it is text-intensive.The surrounding neighborhood is a quiet respite from the maddening tourist crowds of the Dam Square and the Red Light District. There are several restaurants nearby. Try the Cafe Koosje, one block away, for a cozy casual lunch or beverage break on your way to or from the museum."

It is incredibly well put together and quite interactive. You can choose how in depth your tour goes, which is nice when you are pressed for time in a city with so many places to go and see and things to do and eat. I urge you to put this museum on your check list. It was by far the best museum experience I had on my visit to the city!"

It certainly offers interesting anecdotes and details personal experiences from that time, displayed very well and worth seeing from a historic perspective, so if you are a history buff you will love it.

The audio headset should have been given with more explicit instructions. While I am far from a techie, I have been to many museums and I have never been as bewildered by a listening device. Fortunately, a kind Dutch customer helped to show me how to swipe the headset to produce the narrative. The chronological order of events seemed to weave in and around with no clear pattern to me. I will grant that this may be due to the design of the building.Ok--the positives: the initial film is wonderful, breaking down a terrible era to very human terms. The historical information was not \"dumbed-down\"--it was assumed that the audience had a basic understanding of the period, as a result, I learned many interesting things, such as, that 25,000 Dutch volunteers served with Germany on the Russian front. I admire the honesty of the woman who admitted she lacked courage and who could criticize when one considers the danger. I considered this museum a wonderful testament of honesty to a time that many people would like to forget."

(Buy one, as you get many benefits, including free public transport.)It is located opposite the zoo and a tram will take you very close.This is a really impressive facility. Its displays explain how Holland was invaded and occupied by the Nazis. It is remarkably honest about the response of the citizens of the Netherlands and the displays address the very complex issues related to how those citizens responded. It describes, for example, how one young Dutch boy was 'encouraged' to associate himself with Nazi groups because his father determined that it would be better to go along with the occupying forces.This is just one of very many personal real-life scenarios that are recounted with very frank honesty. It gives one an appreciation of the terribly complex and difficult decisions that Dutch people had to make. It also graphically recounts how any resistance was met with violence and barbarity. I learned a great deal. I hadn't, for instance, realized that an equivalent of a Dutch Nazi Party emerged and there is a very striking photograph of its leader visiting a German concentration camp in the company of Himmler. The information, appropriately, is very Dutch-centred, so that statistics relating to prisoners sent to concentration and extermination camps may seem odd, since they strike you as relatively small, but they reflect the Dutch citizens and not the much larger Jewish individuals from throughout Europe. That said, several displays detail the atrocities experienced by Jews of Dutch nationality.An area also recounts the terrible experience of those in Dutch-Indonesia who suffered under the Japanese occupation.One comes away with the impression that the 'Dutch Resistance' was not perhaps as well-organized or active as the French equivalent but that may not be fair. That said, it is clear that substantial and determined resistance did take place and it was met with brutality on the part of the occupying forces.The information is presented via photographs, videos, copies of letters and newspapers, historical artefacts, etc, with lots of explanatory signage. Multi-lingual audio 'guides' are available, which are activated as one comes to different displays. It was the best such system I have ever experienced.The displays are very detailed and there are lots of them. It will take you at least 2 hours, if not more, to work through everything. There are very few seating areas, so prepare to be on your feet for most of the time.The frank manner in which the occupation is tackled is commendable; I doubt whether many countries would be willing to openly tackle the range of relevant sensitive issues in such a manner. It gave me an appreciation of issues that one simply cannot comprehend, unless you have gone through the experience. It was a real eye-opener and highly thought-provoking.Even though this may not be one of the better-known museums in the city, it can get very busy and quite crowded. That can, sometimes, make viewing individual displays awkward. But it is worth tolerating any slight frustration. I think this deserves to be on a not-to-be-missed list of tourist venues in Amsterdam.There is a limited 'souvenir shop' area but no caf\u00e9. However, there is an excellent bar/caf\u00e9/restaurant on the street next door.This is one of the most moving, impressive and fascinating museums I have ever visited. I thoroughly recommend it."

It begins with a video of the period set during the war, and what will be expected within the museum. The museum is filled with very touching stories about courageous individuals whom a lot, who have studied the Nazi era but not in Holland itself, may have never heard about, This is very fascinating for anybody. The audio system is also a very good feature where you can listen to the description of every section on a personal device. I would recommend this museum to anyone looking for something different, and to step back from the business of Amsterdam center itself."

But, as an American tourist, I did not see any credit given to the US and Canada in breaking the starvation blockade \"Hongerwinter\" that ended with a \"Berlin air-lift\" type of food drop. This was a significant climax to the German blockage of Holland. Why no mention! 22,000 dutch citizens starved to death because of this blockade."

It gives a nuanced background into Dutch culture before the war which is integral to understanding the Dutch experience during occupation in WWII. Rather than dodge blame or obfuscate the issue, the designers lay out the entire issue from 4 pillars of society and how they \"adapted, collaborated or resisted\" Nazi policy. It was easy to navigate, beautifully and solemnly displayed, thoroughly capturing collective and individual experiences. The partitioning of displays also allow for privacy which is a testament to the designers. This allows personal reflection and emotion with out public display. The museum did not moralize but instead instructed and illuminated which allows for contemplation of how you may of reacted to occupation."

Not a great deal from a artifacts standpoint and not very interactive as it is a low technology, old school museum, but nonetheless good information and a must stop for any WWII historian visiting Amsterdam.If you're not into WWII history, probably a lower priority in this town where there is so much to do and see."

Trying to make those that either collaborated with the Nazis or did nothing feel less guilty the museum forgets to properly celebrate those heroes who resisted. The best part is the book store where I got the book \"Henk's War\" which is worth reading to understand about the resistance. I've read a ton of books about WWII in Holland. There were many active non Jewish and Jewish resistance fighters and there are many excellent stories that need to be told about them. The section about the Jews during the war is teeny tiny and there is a larger exhibit of the war in the East Indies. Shocking really."

Dutch collaboration (a huge and interesting subject) is dealt with by a couple of recruiting posters for the SS tucked away on one pillar. Information is at least given in English as well as Dutch. The organisation by the staff is poor, the museum is small and gets very crowded, and the entrance price is very steep for what is on offer (\u20ac10) They recommend you spend 3 hours to visit. As someone extremely interested in this period of history, I'd say more like 15 minutes is justified."

Copenhagen boasts a very similar museum to the Amsterdam Versetzmuseum so having been fascinated a few years ago by the minutiae of German occupation of a people that were considered near equals rather than sub-humans by the occupiers, we had high hopes for our visit. We weren't disappointed.The 2.5 hours we spent flew by and did not include the temporary exhibition on Dachau. The quantity and quality of the exhibits themselves were outstanding and, in many cases, highly moving such as the improvised prison xmas tree or the poem written in blood. Others were highly entertaining like the satirical cartoons at the expense of the Germans or the soldiers helmet enameled to serve as a chamber pot. Not everything was labeled in English which was both a pity and a relief as it would have taken a full day to absorb everything on display. The audio guide added nothing to the excellent English captioning but did offer an alternative way of navigating the exhibition. I was pleased that the persecution of the jews didn't dominate the story and was portrayed as just one, albeit sickening and pivotal, feature of the occupation. If I have any misgivings about the Verzetzmuseum then it would be to say that the rhetorical question \"Adapt, collaborate or resist?\" which takes centre stage on the website and introductory film was rarely addressed in the exhibition itself. As a result, despite the oppression of the occupation being brought to life and provoking personal thoughts of how one might respond, because so few unflattering stories were told about Dutch people, it could be argued that the impression was of Amsterdammers being reinvented as a city of heroes in the soviet revisionist style of history. Nonetheless, as someone whose ancestor was shipped off to Auchwitz from Amsterdam, having first left some of his genes in England, this was a truly thought-provoking and unmissable experience."

This museum is the antithesis of hype and self congratulation for their resistance , but rather follows through on the three themes of \"accommodation\",\"cooperation\" and \" collusion\". At every step the complexities of having been an occupied country, with Rotterdam having been leveled, is palpable. Individual stories are woven into the larger social and political realities and I was left with an understanding of what kinds of decisions needed to be made, in the context of war."

Although the museum imparts some information about those who helped Jews in The Neverlands the museum falls short in that the presentation of materials is dated and not that interesting to listen to. I was hoping for more in depth info about those who helped and I would have liked to hear more about their specific stories. The museum could use some updating of presentation of materials. I kind of felt like I was stuck in a museum from the decade of the 70's."

If you're interested in the rise of the Nazi regime in Holland from 1940 to 1945 - this is for you. The museum looks at all forms of resistance particularly during this period but also looks at other forms of political resistance going on today. If you think this sounds a little bit dry, well it's not an all singing all dancing Museum, but I think most people would find it an interesting experience for a few hours. The museum tells an interesting, thought-provoking and horrifying story of what the people of Holland had to go through in this time. If you went to the Anne Frank house and enjoyed it I would definitely recommend this museum. The staff are great, after about an hour in the museum I went out for lunch and then when I showed my ticket came back again and spent a couple more hours in the afternoon. Also If you're there towards the end of the day, there is a fantastic chicken restaurant on the same side of the road opposite the zoo serving rotisserie chicken from about 4 PM!! If you get off the tram (line 9) by the zoo the museum is really close by (30 seconds walk away on other side of road)"

The 'power in numbers' was evident as it seemed that much of the Dutch resistance came in the form of strikes. While individuals helped others across the country (and some chose not to help), there were many strikes aimed at weakening the ability of the occupiers to continue their efforts. For such a small population, it also seemed that there were many many parties/factions among the Dutch, with their own meetings, newspapers, and the like. Quite interesting."

My boyfriend and I are WWII history buffs and on a rainy day in Amsterdam it seemed like a no brainer choice for a museum since the Van Gough needs to be booked in advance. While this museum has some interesting points, I believe the Anne Frank house is a much more \"real\" and vivid experience of what it was like to live in Holland during WWII. First off, the museum isn't in the most centrally located. I'm all for exploring and getting off the beaten path as we did a day trip the afternoon before, but after a twenty minute walk there it is pretty clear the museum is on its own in a residential neighborhood for attractions besides the zoo. The museum has a few interesting artifacts such as a radio made out of a match box, a resistance newspaper printing press, but that is it for the most part in terms of artifacts. The idea of the museum answers the question of whether the Dutch people consolidate, adjust of resist to the Nazi occupation. While there were a few stories of resistance and examples of fighters turned into concentration camps, the fact is the country hadn't updated their army since 1900 and were easily won over without fight. While there are examples such as Anne Frank (not in the museum) and a few other citizens who had interesting stories - the Netherlands did not have a influential role in the war which made the museum lack in interest."

Because of that we were asked to leave exhibits on multiple occasions which was frustrating for the kids and hard to enjoy this part of the museum.

Lots of interactive bits, things to open, things to sit in or climb through, stories fed through audio guides in a number of languages etc. Based on 4 real life stories, all survived the war. It's educational and fun without trivialising the horror that so many went through. My 9 year old said it was the best thing she'd ever been to and she learned more about families in hiding there than she did following the trudge of hundreds through Anne Frank's House.

It covers the work of the resistance and there is a big focus on the children, how they were transported out of Amsterdam and fostered by other families in Holland. The museum is so very interesting, information is given in English and Dutch, after two hours we had reached saturation point, and we had not visited all that is to offer.

It is very organized and well laid out with a very thorough audio guide. The museum is a bit misnamed (at least in English) as it follows the choices that every person had to make during the war, not just to resist but also whether or not to collaborate or even remain neutral (adapt) during that time. I thought it explored each option compassionately and with honest explanations of the consequences without villainizing any one person's choices. There are many artifacts, newsreels, videos, and recordings of people explaining their situations and choices from the time. The museum more or less follows the occupation period chronologically and ends with liberation. I would suggest it for children over the age of 12 due to some of the content. There are no stairs or impediments for those with mobility issues (one of the few in Amsterdam), and coin return lockers are available just inside the entrance. Included in the Museumkaart. We spent two hours and explored at a slower/leisurely pace."

It is worth watching the little video they have on the upper floor before going through the exhibits, although it is based on the assumption you know nothing about the Nazi invasion. (The video area isn't that well marked.) The video talks about one of the themes of the museum. When you are occupied do you collaborate, accept it, or resist? The museum follows what happened in Holland from the 1930's, to the invasion by Germany, and the years that followed. You can either read the information (almost all of it is available in English) or there is also an audio guide. There are pictures, some videos, artifacts, etc. It is quite well done. At some points it got a little confusing as to where you were expected to go next to follow the story chronologically. That would be about the only problem I had with it. We were there about an hour and a half. You could certainly spend longer, but by that time we had been on our feet all day and there was really no where to sit and rest for a moment or two.

The museum presents general themes, but also tells the story of individual people and how they coped with Nazi rule. It is entertaining and instructive. There is an adjoining cafe. A two hour visit would be good. We started listening to the free audio guide, but found that it duplicated the wall signage a lot. Admittedly, we did not listen to the added extras on the audio guide. Because I do not read Dutch, I was unable to decipher some of the historic posters and historic artifacts.

We found the museum to be very informative and insightful into the occupation of Amsterdam during the Second World War, full of accounts from every aspect with good visual effects to aid our education. We enjoyed that with the audio guides you could gain more information on certain subjects by holding it against various posts on the walls (needless to say we used pretty much every one). It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and my highlight of our visit to Amsterdam.

Designed to get you to ask 'what would you do?' - it takes the story of a town, and individuals within it, to show what life was like living under the Nazi occupation. It leads you through how the occupation began and developed, and gives insights in to why some people resisted and others didn't. But without judgement.....always asking what would you do? The stories of individuals lead us to recognise that sometimes the smallest acts of defiance were also resistance, and mattered too! The museum also offers a welcome to children, with a special exhibition and stories of their peers, making it relevant. Excellent and well worth the visit."

I think this was my favorite of all those I visited. Learned about young Dutch men hiding to avoid transport to German labor camps toward the end of the war. Jews were not the only people being hidden by the Dutch. Brave people helped many to survive. 17,000 of those who hid survived the war!"

Our granddaughter (age 14) felt the stories of the children in the juvenile section helped her the most in understanding the dilemma of \"what decision is the right one\". We also found this interesting especially when tied to the interviews at the end of the exhibit. Hearing their reactions to what transpired and the results of their decisions (or their parent's decisions) was very interesting and highlighted even more the difference in perception of what is \"right\" and what is \"wrong\".There are a lot of pictures and a lot of information to digest. It gives you a better understanding of the questions each person has to answer when they are occupied. Do you resist and if so, how? Do you work within the system to try and effect as much good as possible and if you do, is there a line you can't cross? The stories of bravery were powerful. It is always amazing to me to see the difference that one person - one brave person - can make. As our granddaughter said, \"You'd like to think that if something like that happened, you would do the right thing - but when it happens, you don't know if you will actually have the courage."

However, more effort should have been awarded to those who helped allied air crews escape back to England, sharing what little food starving people had and showing how careful the resistance had to be with a starving populace."

And there is the ever-present question, asked at the exhibit's entrance: What would you do? Adapt? Accommodate? Resist? Hope things will improve? Look at the context, so ably presented here (in Engish and Dutch), and answer honestly."

There are photos (with Dutch & English text), films and extremely personal accounts of individuals. Entry includes headphones with audio in your language of choice, and the staff are very helpful answering questions. What impressed me was that it wasn't only a story of those who actively resisted, but it put the period (political, economic, religious) into context, making the point that not everything is black and white."

When I first walked in, the attendants were very gracious to not make fun of the very little Dutch I knew and spoke to me in English, which helped a lot. I first took a right and watched the informational video on Holland during World War II, which you have a few options of languages to watch it in. After the video, I walked through the exhibit. It was extremely informational and well put together. Most of the exhibits are interactive and are in Dutch and English. My only regret was I arrived late in the day and only had a limited time to go through. The one exhibit I really wanted to see but couldn't because I ran out of time was the resistance in the Dutch East Indies against the Japanese and follow on revolution, which resulted in modern day Indonesia. I highly recommend this museum to anybody that is in Amsterdam."

This Museum was the last on my museum stops and really should have just seamlessly moved with the Jewish Quarter museums to round out the total story. (after all the Jewish Quarter I was exhausted but should have continued on.--So I highly recommend it) Once again, the interactive nature of the exhibition helped you to be part of the Resistance Movement..even as the other interactive museums have brought you into these parts of the Dutch Historys. This museum helps to outline how the Dutch people were taken by surprise with the German invasion, and then how the resistance developed. These heroes nearly always sacrificed their own lives and desperately tried to save the children. It was incredible. And then, the children themselves formed their own resistance patterns (the Junior Resistance temporary exhibition) and then the children who were sent to the country (because they were starving) I have had a hard time understanding this history, but these museums and this one in particular help to describe the Dutch belief that flooding the land through the dykes would save them from entry, yet they were not ready for air travel and paratrooping in the German troops. Humbling. Well presented. Thank you Amsterdam."

Besides the main exhibit which examines and depicts the various responses to The Netherlands' capitulation to the Nazi invasion, there is a young person's interactive exhibit (limited to 8 people at a time and full when I went, so I continued on), a limited edition exhibit that featured interviews from 8-10 Dutch recalling their experiences during the \"hunger time\" when all foods were confiscated for export to Nazi Germany and the difficult decisions their parents made to send their children to the countryside in hopes they would find kindly foster families to feed them. Finally, another compelling exhibit of the impact WW2 had on Dutch colonies - particularly modern-day Indonesia. Wonderfully done exhibits with preserved artifacts, films, videoed personal histories.

Depending on how interactive you want to be, give the museum a good 1-2 hours. Great little lunch place next door, the Brasserie, which had lovely homemade soups and sandwiches!"

We got in for free with our IAmsterdam card.The museum was a little confusing to work your way around with no signage to guide you in the right order. The personal statements from people involved in the war were very interesting and often moving, however some of the exhibits and tableaux were a little thin on actual material and information.I was disappointed there wasn't more about the actual resistance movement itself. There was a lot of description of the build up to the war, which did provide useful context but also overshadowed the rest of the content.I found myself getting a little lost in the layout of the museum and confused as to where I was supposed to go next. There were also rooms off to the side that held more exhibits but it wasn't immediately clear if you could enter or not.I admit that the presence of a large and noisy school group, whilst we were there did not help matters however I was still a little disappointed overall not to hear more of the brave people and actions they took during the war in Holland."

This museum takes the visitor on an end to end journey of the dutch experience and for me it was very emotional, educational, and has given me a great deal of insight into what it must have been like at the beginning through the ever increasing German brutality and the resulting resistance movement, the hunger winter, and the eventual arrival of the allies and the process of regaining freedom. Then add to this narrative the story of the Dutch East Indies and the battle against the Japanese and the difficult transition to Independence and you cannot help but to be overwhelmed with the impact of these events. Go see it, you will be glad you did."

I recommend doing this one first for background. It is not as crowded as Anne Frank Huis, thus you have more time to contemplate and absorb the exhibits. A fairly small museum, it felt like just the right size as it is a very emotional journey. I spent between 2.5 and 3 hours here.I walked to the museum from the Centraal Station and although I had a map, I managed to overshoot the entrance.

The museum is complemented by audio and visual exhibits and makes you think about the difficulty the dutch people faced during the war. The question 'Adapt, collaborate or resist?' is asked throughout. There is a 'junior' part of the museum - this shows the war from the point of view of different children where their families are in different circumstances - e.g. a jewish family, a resisting family, a dutch nazi family etc. Whilst primarily aimed at children (and was being used by school groups when we arrived), the museum staff told us it was very popular with adults and well worth looking at. (We do not have children ourselves). They were right. It is at the back of the main museum, and well worth the detour from the main route for 45 mins. If you have kids, take them to this part first!"

It is a fascinating account of people who created resistence in many different forms. It gave explanations for people who didn't resist and people who collaborated. I believe it was this museum where you were able to follow the lives of several people who survived the war. The disappointing thing at the end for me as a Canadian was that the museum gives credit to countries who helped liberate Holland. I know Canada made a significant contribution but we were not really recognized amongst the other countries. The Museum decided to use the Canadian flag at the time of WWII which was the Red Ensign but it can only be identified as Canadian by the shield on the flag since many British Commonwealth countries used and continue to use the Ensign. I explained this to the people at the museum who said many Canadians had commented about this but that their curator had researched this thoroughly - clearly she hadn't and they need to put an identifiable Canadian flag along with the other countries - unless of course they don't feel our efforts were worth it."

This has really great, personal-level information and some neat, little-known tid-bits from this period of history. It was very interesting to see how the Dutch dealt very differently than other nations when they were overrun by the Nazi's. The layout is a little confusing, but stick with it and you'll figure it out. There is Soooo much to read (and most all of it is translated into English) that it will take you quite a few hours to get through it all. I would set aside a whole morning or afternoon for this one or if you just want to skim-read you can probably get through in an hour. BTW - it is right across from the zoo, so if there are little ones that wouldn't really want to read about the resistance in Holland, you can split up and conquer (although there is a children's section to this museum, but I didn't partake so I cannot review it).Overall, a good thing to do."

We decided to head across to this museum as our first port of call as neither of us knew much about the resistance movement in the Netherlands and as we had luggage with us we didn't want to spend a lot of time traipsing across the city. This is genuinely one of the best museums I have ever visited (and I do love museums) with the staff being some of the friendliest I have ever encountered. Upon our arrival they allowed my friend and I to store our luggage and seemed really thrilled that the museum had been our first port of call. Upon leaving they also assisted us with finding the right tram to get us to our apartment which we were renting. The museum tells it's story using real life narratives of individuals who experienced the war from all sides and does not hold back. It explains the war truthfully, using propaganda items, photos, videos and sound recordings, enabling you to understand the complexity of the situation and the difficult decisions normal citizens were forced to make. Areas around the museum are thematically and chronologically organised and the way everything was written (English and Dutch) myself and my friend (who are in our mid twenties) felt compelled to read everything.Amsterdam is a great choice for a city break however with so many sights this museum could easily not make the list but I would highly recommend it doing so. If you are interested in World War II and are thinking of visiting Anne Frank's house then visiting the museum before hand really sets the scene."

We visited this museum with our eleven-year-old son, who didn't have a moment of boredom in either the adult or children's sections of the museum.The adult's section is presented in Dutch and English. Displays of papers and artifacts are next to multimedia displays explaining and detailing the events in the Netherlands during World War II. Particularly moving to me was the display showing copies of the last letters flung from the Jewish deportation trains in desperation. This display is a 3D display, and when one can almost see the letters fluttering to the ground as the train pulls away. Throughout the displays are pictures of members of the Dutch Resistance and the activities they participated in during the occupation. This really made the history seem personal.The children's section of the museum was mainly in Dutch, but fully interactive. Language barrier aside, my son (and my husband, if I'm being honest. I'm actually not sure which one of them was more fascinated by the presentation) spent a very long time going through each of the houses of different real Dutch children - the child of a Dutch resistance member, a Nazi sympathizer, a Jewish child, and a child of a family trying to survive without becoming too engaged in either side - and studying their stories. This museum was a fantastic site to visit, with so much to learn about the WWII era. It was well worth the three hours we spent visiting."

It uses audio-visual guides and short film clips to accompany the many texts and transcripts of period time accounts. The display looks a bit small and underwhelming when you enter but you soon realise the extent of the layout. Many artifacts are displayed throughout to add interest as you work your way around. Although I knew a certain amount about this period prior to my visit I felt this museum gave me a much better understanding of it and I would definitely recommend it.

As a historian, I would quibble with a few of the accounts, but that doesn't mar the overall experience. The only regret is that all the books in the too small shop were in Dutch.

There are at least five museums in Amsterdam that purport to focus heavily on the resistance, but this one has the clearest focus. It's low tech and relies heavily on 1980s technology, but its documentation of the unfolding of the resistance is thorough. Audio guides allow the viewer to experience actual audio footage from the period in Dutch (German in some cases, but with English translations). The experience was very powerful. A separate area for children takes them through the lives of four tweens from the period of the resistance and shows how their families responded to the changes differently, and then how this affected their lives after the war. It brings the realities of making political decisions into a stark perspective."

Attention to the mundane details, whether in Amsterdam or in internment camps, kept the focus on the human experience, not just the political/military. Inclusion of events in Indonesia very interesting. The only unpleasant part was the amount of noise made by several large school groups. Most of it was relevant to seeing the museum (teachers talking loud enough for all to hear, students getting excited about an exhibit, etc.) but because the exhibits are so compactly arranged the noise was amplified and became quite overwhelmng at times."

It was incredibly interesting to see the war from a different country's perspective and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this attraction. Lots of interactive displays and audio, plus a special area of the museum is dedicated to children. Would recommend."

Set within the old Jewish quarter a more detailed history of the local resistance in Amsterdam to the Nazis in WW2.Civil disobedience and strikes in reaction to the worsening treatment and restrictions on the Jewish population and later the defeated Dutch army. Excellent displays and make use of the free audio guides. Temporary display (November 2014) including video diaries of people who were children in WW2. Very enthusiastic local staff who were taking teenage school groups around. Puts the Anne Frank story into a far better local context."

            "review": "Surprisingly informative and enjoyable.. This museum is extremely effective at providing detailed insight regarding the German occupation of The Netherlands during WWII, from the perspective of the Dutch people. The many conflicts regarding whether to resist and how to do so are portrayed through various images, documents, videos and re-creation of the environment. For instance, unique Items such as a small Christmas tree fabricated out of bandages and medication wrappings by a resistance prisoner while in solitary confinement after he'd been shot give a valuable perspective to the prison cell exhibit. The overall transition from uneasy co-existence to outright acrimony is depicted in the same gradual but highly crescendoed manner as it probably developed. This is quite an interactive exhibit, so it would be of interest to children, though some of the topics may be excessively macabre. The (free) audio tour in this museum is particularly well-designed, as you simply hold your device to one of many (30+?) labeled 'docking' locations as you enter any given exhibit or area, and the corresponding description begins automatically. You can then choose additional details on the topic by selecting various buttons on the device. As with most of the WWII resistance museums I have seen in various cities, you can sense the pride of the people in their desire to emphasize the sacrifices made by their citizens and their significant role in helping defeat the occupiers despite a fairly quick initial surrender, which is really the most valuable aspect of this experience. The location, about a twenty-minute walk or so from Dam Square, is well-worth it. Easy to combine with a visit to the Rembrandt House, which is a mere 10 minute walk."

The choices are presented in what I felt was a non-judgemental way leaving the visitor to make their own mind up.As with many museums there is an enforced locker for large bags which is ideal in so many ways, I can put mine away and enjoy the visit and no bumping of others, the deposit being returned when you are finished with the locker.

The museum posts the dilemmas faced by the Dutch when their country was invaded by the Germans: acceptance and go on with life, collaborate with the new regime or resistance. It educates on what society was like before the Germans, how people reacted differently during the 5 year occupancy, and how brutal the Germans were not only to the Jews but also to the Dutch who were appalled at what was happening to their friends and neighbors."

Most of our knowledge of Dutch resistance was pretty limited (people who helped the Frank family, etc.) This place was filled with terrific exhibits that put the entire Dutch Resistance movement into context and also strives to examine the alternatives of capitulating to the invaders as well as being complicit with them as a means of survival. There is also a great facet of the museum that deals with Dutch resistance in the Pacific Theater, to which I had never given much thought.We wound up spending far more time than we had originally thought/planned. It was one of the highlights of our recent trip to Amsterdam."

I spent more than 4 hrs here, taking a break for lunch at the cafe next door. There is a free audio guide that comes with the ticket, and is one of the museums you can use your museumkart with. The displays are so interactive and visually appealing. This is so much more than the focus on the resistance. You will read and learn about the different mindsets of the various religious, political parties, civic groups, and social classes during the period of 40-45. It explains what the general mindset was of each group: resist, collaborate, comply. There is also a wonderfully done exhibit that focuses on the Dutch that were interred in the prisoner camps in the East Indies during the Japanese occupation of this area once they joined the war. The last area focuses on liberation. Lots of interactive displays, personal accounts, and items from the period 40-45. Original broadcasts of announcement of invasion, sermons from the pulpit of both a Catholic and Protestant church. I could go on and on but if you love history, this is not a museum to miss! It is in the same area of the Portugese Synagogue, Jewish Historical Museum, and just around the corner from the Jewish Theater(Hollande Schwouberg). The building itself is across the street from the Artis Zoo, and the front of the building is yellow. Trams 9 and 14 serve this area."

The dreadful plight of the Jewish people living in the city at the time of the invasion was nothing short of heart rending and very upsetting but well worth remembrance.In short if you expect to leave your visit uplifted by tales of heroics of the resistance you may like me be rather disappointed, we left feeling quite upset.

I found especially interesting the exhibit on the experience of the Dutch in the Pacific theater especially the old Dutch East Indies, today's Indonesia. This is a topic often ignored in many western histories of the War in the Pacific.

Given that, my expectations of museums that must convey historically accurate information, displays and artifacts in a cohesive, consistent and - most critical - an intuitive flow are very high. Considering all that - let me touch on the positives of this museum: 1. It is a very full museum. The artifacts, information and historically detailed material found in this musuem is mind-blowing. Truly, this is a treasure of one of the most important resistance movements in all of WWII. They should be most proud. 2. They offer interactive exhibits to attract the young. I can't express how wonderful and welcome this is; especially those traveling with kids that may/may not find themselves interested in the topics. Thus, the interactivity was fun for both our teen and ourselves. 3. The staff is amazing. Truly. They are very helpful. 4. The cost, while a bit steep, is worth it; solely for the bounty that is present within. The reason for the \"average\" rating could partially be our fault. We had only two hours for the visit; so we likely didn't give it justice; however - for a one-level museum, one hour should be plenty. The challenge that I had was the flow and the signage. While the signs were in English, there was no logical flow of time, truly, to the exhibits. They wind around and, they chronologically jump around as well. While I am sure not intended, that is the outcome. It is a blessing and a curse when you have so much access to so much history and so many artifacts. The blessing is that you have a wealth of detail to tell the story of the Dutch resistance. The curse is that you have SO MUCH and quantity may detract from the quality. I feel that is what happened here. By all means, do visit this museum. DO take the time to watch the quick 7-minute film at the entrance as that provides the foundation. And, if you can, spend several hours here. It is worth it as there is so much to see. If you are a true historian, you will respect the museum for that. If you are looking for a quick hit museum to get a little bit of knowledge; this may be overwhelming. If that is your goal - I highly recommend just touring the kids exhibit. It touches on the key facts and brings the interactive element to it to keep it paced and interesting. Overall, I give this an \"Average Plus\" or a \"Very Good Minus\"."

It started by asking the visitor to think about the experience of occupation and the ways one might react to this then led us through how both individuals and the nation did face the war. The small junior section was wonderful and focused on real people bringing their stories to life by recreating their war time rooms. The Vertzetsmuseum museum is well worth a visit."

A very interesting display with lots of detail about the German occupation and the problems of conscience it imposed on Dutch citizens Of course, it is always the politician's view which goes along the lines of \"if I don't collaborate, then someone even worse will, and so I am taking a realistic and patriotic approach\". . It is always worthwhile to remember that it was long after the D-Day landings that the Netherlands became \"liberated\".  I was particularly intrigued by the short section on the Dutch East Indies, which I had almost forgotten that it had been conquered by the Japanese, although I am very familiar with what happened in Singapore.I was also amazed to hear the theme tune of the famous \"BBC Sports Report\" radio show for many years being played as the theme for some sort of German sports propaganda film."

It is one of the best I have been to anywhere in the world.The museum looks small once you get to the main section, but there is so much information packed into the exhibits that it takes some time just to see the WWII part (there's also a section on the Dutch East Indies I didn't have time for). The presentation of information is just as impressive as the volume. The progression is easy to follow and thoughtfully arranged, and the descriptions are to the point and centered around a recurring theme that asks the poignant question of \"Collaborate, adapt, or resist?\" The subject matter is covered thoroughly, so no matter what aspects of WWII you're interested in, there's a section here for you. The audio guide is free and is one of the more useful ones I've come across, so I recommend taking it.I was particularly moved by the paintings done while in hiding by Heinz Geiringer, a young man murdered in a concentration camp who would have become Anne Frank's step-brother after her father re-married to his mother post-war. Some of his paintings were full of hope and longing for freedom, while others were full of despair. If a picture is worth 1,000 words, it's heartbreaking that these are not famous as Anne's diary. The paintings are not displayed all together with one in the children's museum, where you can learn more about Heinz. It's just as interesting for adults.On top of all this, the reception staff were most friendly and there's no giant lineup!Anne Frank's house may be the most famous WWII related place to go in Amsterdam, but if you want to really learn about the Dutch involvement in the war, history lovers will find themselves much more satisfied here."

Whilst it was very good and both interesting and at times quite shocking, I was a little disappointed not to learn more about actual members of the resistance and the operations which they carried out. It would also have been interesting to learn more about how the Nazi's infiltrated the resistance and the damage that this caused. The visiting exhibit on children of the holocaust is very saddening and along with some of the exhibits in the permanent exhibition give you an education into the human tragedy that the occupation brought to the people of Holland and the other occupied countries. The newly opened education centre is also well worth a visit for anyone with children with it's interactive experiences and personal recollections from people who were children during the occupation being enlightening for young minds."

The museum is well laid out, although we were encouraged to follow the 'footsteps' to the Kinder Museum section and thus accidentally did the museum backwards. Many of the displays and items of interest are 'hidden' in furniture or viewed through 'spy' holes to further enhance the feelings of secrecy. There was a temporary exhibition of the horrendous removal and subsequent murder of the cities children and I defy anyone to visit and not be moved. The museum is based on personal accounts of life leading up to and during the occupation rather than a totally collective representation and the children's section also reflects this with the personal experiences of children from different sections of the population-Jewish, resistance, collaborators. It was an especially difficult period in the history of the city and we came away hoping that we would never have to ask ourselves the same questions or be confronted with the same difficulties in our lives. The accompanying book is in Dutch and English (as was the whole exhibition with free audio guides) and is a fascinating read."

The audio tour is free, and does a great job of telling the story of Dutch life during WWII, from the early days of the Nazi occupation to liberation. It's done roughly chronologically, with side areas that explore specific topics in a bit more depth, so you can really understand how and why the resistance came to be. The theme of the museum is to ask you what would do in the same circumstances: adapt, collaborate, or resist. The area for kids is the probably the single best kid-specific exhibition I have ever seen anywhere in the world. I'd actually recommend that even adults without kids do it, as I found it fascinating. The exhibit tells the story of four different (real life) kids who all experienced the war from vary different perspectives: a Jew who went into hiding and was ultimately caught and sent to the camps, a girl whose father was a Nazi collaborator, a boy whose father was in the Resistance, (and I've forgotten now what the 4th was!). Each one has a separate area and you discover the story of what happened to them during the war as you go through a little display. Then at the end, there's a room with video screens where they are playing clips of interviews with the four real life people, now fairly elderly, and they explain why they wanted to tell their stories, what they remember about the war, etc. It's really amazing and very moving.Also, this is easily combined with a visit to the zoo (Artis) which is directly across the street. And there's a good burger place on the same street, and an ice cream place. So it's easy to convince the kids to go to a museum that they might think they won't be interested (though they will be once they get there) with the promise of a burger, ice cream, and a trip to the zoo."

We saw the Rijksmuseum, the Stedelijk, Van Gogh, Hermitage, and Anne Frank museums, but none of them really delivered an experience as cohesive as the one the Verzetsmuseum provided. I think this is partially due to the specific nature of the museum itself - naturally, it relied on many written artifacts and personal accounts of stressful and dangerous times - so it gave a very personal perspective that really allowed you to step into the shoes of the Dutch resistance. Though it wasn't as high tech, I still liked it the best.There was one moment where I watched film taken by a Jewish father of his two daughters growing up, and I just couldn't help but see myself and my sister reflected in their antics (eating cherries, chasing each other, play-fighting). Paired with the sad narrative of their deportation as their neighbors watched helplessly, that one artifact brought the experience into a realistic frame for me. It's something I'll remember for a very long time.Although it may be on the side, Rick Steves gives it a 2-triangle rating of importance, and it doesn't seem to be very crowded most of the time. Plus audioguides are free. Definitely give this a look if you're in the area or have free time."

It gave you a good idea of changing view points on the occupation and every day life during the war. Ran out of time (closes at 5pm) to hear the different stories about four children's struggles. Will have to go back! Definitely get the free hand held recording device. The plaques are in Dutch and English but the hand-held recordings give you more insight.

While the one drawback is a lack of English subtitles for the visual exhibits, the audio in ENglish helps a lot. The most fascinating aspect of this museum is at the end where you go through the Junior resistance exhibit. WOW. You find yourself able to travel through those difficult times with 5 young Dutch kids. You can pick who you travel with. I happened to choose the little Jewish girl. Again, like I said in the title, if you cannot get into the Anne Frank house then you need to go here. The little girl was a neighbor of Anne Frank's family and her story is truly remarkable. In addition, to the exhibits there is a room at the top of the museum where there is a small library and tables where one can sit and do some research. I was truly amazed with this place."

It took us forever to find because the tram system we used to get there was very confusing! (If you go, get off at whatever stop is nearest to the zoo and walk, it's on the same street). We were expecting a comprehensive exhibit about the organized Dutch resistance during Nazi occupation. We did not find it. The introductory video shows 4 different people and how they responded to the occupation, and promises that the museum will show you the various choices that people made regarding resisting the regime. It doesn't. It's a disorganized, not-very-well-laid out exhibit that gives the impression that there really WASN'T any kind of organized resistance. Worth seeing if you have some time to kill but overall disappointing. Don't go out of your way to see this unless WWII history is your thing."

Don't go to the cafe next door, the waitress there was very blunt when we asked for food. Despte menus being on the table she told us they did not serve food until 11. Walk to end of the street and there is a large cafe with outside seating. Very friendly and great food.Anyway, back to the museum. The staff were very friendly and polite as they checked us in.

Well presented, well curated and well laid out, this is definitely worth a visit.

We really enjoyed our visit here and would go again.

But by three quarters of way through, both my husband and I just couldn't read any more through mental tiredness, and so we missed how it all ended up (but guess liberation was the end of the story!) We felt very tired when we left, after around 2-3 hours. However, it is all quite interesting and we learned a lot. Just far too much to read and take in, and some of layout quite confusing.It starts by telling you how occupation started and how demonstrations began and how the resistance came into being. However I felt disappointed in the sometimes trivial information presented as \"resistance\" i.e. just thoughts written down by someone who didn't want the Germans in their country, but couldn't do anything about it.There was no real substance as to what the resistance really was as an organised body and how they operated. For instance, I would like to have known about spies and their work and what the resistance really accomplished underground, but it was more an exhibition of people trying to demonstrate but being clamped down on, and the church openly trying to encourage people from the pulpit to take in Jews, and individual people that did so. If you can call that \"resistance\", well, I guess its all about what resistance really means.There was a large room about the Jewish children and 3 massive walls of photos and missing photos of the children from Amsterdam who died, although the list is not complete (Anne Frank is not on the list for some reason but didn't have time to find out why). I found this section unnecessary and should maybe have been in a Jewish museum, because it really had nothing to do with the resistance but more to do with Nazi evils. I would like to have seen a room about spies and what they did. I found the room about the children very sad, but nothing to do with the resistance, so why is it there?There was a section about how radio transmitters were banned and how individuals hid them under floorboards or made their own in defiance. Not sure if this really comes under \"resistance\" or personal \"disobedience\", but it was all interesting how they were put together.There was a large section on how the poplace co-operated with the Nazis out of necessity by going and working in Germany as there was little other choice, and that they were basically slave labour. All the reasons were given by individuals as to why they compromised. Although interesting, it was really nothing to do with the resistance at all.So, overall an informative museum but with a lot of unnecessary fillers which were time consuming and because of this, it was an anti-climax at the end, when we didnt read about how it all ended up. All in all there is nothing much about what the resistance accomplished to thwart the Nazi machine during the occupation. It was more to do with defiance of the spirit through lack of co-operation."

Also lots of contemporary film clips, including 'soft' Nazi propaganda.

Knuckled down, rebelled, or actively resisted the Nazis' rule? There is a short film upstairs that gives a brief chronology and starts the questioning- see it first.

The focus on the subtle and more revolutionary ways that the Dutch resisted the Nazi occupation is absolutely fascinating. As a non-Dutch speaker it would have been helpful if the printed items (such as wartime posters or newspapers) could have been translated as I was sometimes left really curious about certain parts of the exhibit, but not speaking Dutch is certainly my own fault! Highly recommended museum."

This modern, well laid out museum looks at Holland in the lead up to WWII, the rise of the NSB, following onto the period of occupation (1940 to 1945).The main points are covered like the general strike of 1941 and other strikes that followed; what it was like to be under occupation, the Royal family in exile, the implementation of the deportation of Jews, the resistance and how these organisations evolved. Many people\u2019s views and stories are displayed along with individual photographs, archival photos, ID cards and papers and items that showed what it was like to be an occupied country or part of the resistance movement. The display culminates with liberation, and the outcome for Holland. There is also a small section on the Dutch colonial Empire and WWII in Java. Here thousand of Dutch men fought against Japan.I found this museum very interesting. The stories that are told on the boards are very honest and very human. Some stories made me smile at a person\u2019s defiance or tenacity; others brought tears to my eyes. Always reminding me how fortunate I am never to have lived through a war, while applauding the courage of those who stood up for their beliefs, and in some cases risked their lives for unknown \u201csomeone\u201d. For the betterment of our world stories like these need to be told. To add another layer, visit to the Hollandsche Schouwburg Memorial, down the street and around the corner on Plantage Middenlaan. This was the Jewish deportation depot to the death camps. Across the road is a small plaque that identifies the Jewish children\u2019s nursery.Entry Cost E8.00, free with Museumkaart.Photography allowed; no flash.Visit time: allow about 2 hours or more to see all exhibits. If you just want to have a condensed overview without all the side rooms, probably allow about an hour or so."

            "review": "Good for children but sadly lacking some key parts of history. First, let me start by saying what I thought was good about this museum. It did a really good job detailing life under the occupation during WWII. Having grandparents who lived through this and having read a significant amount about Holland and WWII, much of this was very accurate. I found this part very interesting. The best part of the museum was the children's section. My son spent a significant amount of time in that section, and even as an adult, I found it quite interesting. This section didn't romanticize the Dutch that everyone resisted, but showed the children how different people made different choices. The fault I have with the museum comes at the end, when they have an exhibition on the liberation of Holland. Canada is rarely made mention of, although they were the army who freed most of the Netherlands. The D-day landings were described as only the Americans and British. The Canadians, despite taking one of the five beaches, were not mentioned. The current Canadian flag is not displayed, although the old flag is (most people don't even know this is the Canadian flag though). When I spoke to one of the staff about this, she said that since Canada fought as part of the Commonwealth, it was lumped together with the British. When I mentioned to her that Canada in fact fought during WW2 with its own army and that the First and Second Canadian Army liberated most of the Netherlands, she said that since Canada was a part of the Commonwealth, they were not mentioned as an independent country. I found this quite offensive to the sacrifices of the more than 7600 Canadian soldiers who died liberating the Netherlands, and to the many more soldiers who lived with horrific memories of that time. Most Dutch people are very grateful for the Canadians who sacrificed to free their country, but the person at the museum was quite unyielding. While Canada is a part of the Commonwealth, they declared war as an independent country, not because they were compelled to by Britain."

The exhibit takes you through the history of the war as told from the Dutch perspective with general facts of the war and resistance in the Netherlands and snippets of personal accounts from Dutch and Jewish people living in Holland as well. I love history and have been to many museums that explore WWII history, but this museum was unique in that it offered a different, more specific perspective.

When you enter there is a cinema on the left but there are no signs to point it out and the staff at the desk fail to tell you about it. When you enter the museum there are a few red arrows on the ground that point you in the right direction to begin with but then just stop so you are left aimlessly wandering around jumping from the start of the war to the liberation. It wasn't just me that thought this - a few couples that I talked to thought the same. Why not just carry on with the arrows on the floor throughout the whole exhibit?This COULD be a great museum but it is so poorly laid out that it ruins it."

My sister is the family historian and I never paid much attention to family history -- until a recent driving vacation through Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Lots of highlights and a few low ones. Among the best of the highlights was the Dutch Resistance Museum in Amsterdam. I will admit that much of my family background is Dutch and Belgian, but in a few hour trip to this museum really impressed on me the courage of many ordinary Dutch citizens during WWII. The \"junior\" or youth part of the museum was perhaps the most interesting because it is highly interactive and informative, highlighting the lives of four real Dutch youth from four very different family backgrounds and ideological backgrounds. The museum is at some level overwhelming because there is so much written (both Dutch and English) and audio (Dutch and English) information that can be processed. So many displays that nicely flow. We spent probably three hours at the museum and could have spent much longer. It is an easy walk from the central train station, is adjacent to the Jewish quarter, across the street from a zoo and botanical garden ... very easy to spend a day in a contained area. Also, we found Amsterdam fairly high-priced by US standards - about average by Danish standards -- but this museum was reasonably priced. If you want to eat before or afterwards, be prepared for a bit of a walk -- that was probably the drawback."

            "review": "A highlight of our trip - recommend.. This really is an excellent museum. Considering the relatively small area it occupies, they have managed to squeeze so much into this place but there isn't a sense of things being crammed in. The exhibits are well presented in Dutch and English and touch on some quite powerful subjects around the occupation of the Netherlands and the Dutch colonies during WW2. There are lots of physical artefacts to support the written exhibits; for example, a crystal radio design that was developed by a young resistance member and a baby pram with a handgun hidden in the cot. These add depth to the accounts of the other exhibits and make for a well rounded, well informed, and at times quite saddening experience. You can pay extra for an audio guide, but if you're travelling on a budget it is still a great experience without one - we didn't bother and still took a lot away from it.This museum really made us think about an area of the Second World War which is rarely taught in history in British schools, and gave us a huge respect for the people of the Netherlands and a real appreciation of the freedoms of modern life that we enjoy daily. Thought provoking, powerful, and well presented. You can get in here for free with an i-amsterdam card but if you don't have one it's still worth paying the admission fee (which at \u20ac8 for an adult is pretty good value given the prices of other places) to get into one of the best museums I've ever visited. A must see for a trip to Amsterdam."

I admire the Dutch people for the stance they took. Unfortunately they were 'duped' by propaganda and victims of their own naivety. All very pertinent to this exhibition. It was encouraging to see how good can overcome evil. My gripe with the museum was the background noise. I could barely hear the audio with the sound effects from other parts - I pointed this out to one of the staff @ reception. She advised it's part of the exhibition - but for me it was far too loud! It took away from what could otherwise have been a totally absorbing experience. TIP: Avoid when school tours are in progress. (For obvious reasons - 30 / 40 kids scurrying about). Have a coffee or two & let them go ahead. But don't let it put you off. Amsterdam has so many places to visit / this one will have a lasting impression."

It was almost as if they took every piece they had collected and decided that it had to ALL be displayed at the same time. Some of the displays were also difficult to read and see as they were deep shadow boxes, and flush to the wall making it difficult to read the pieces they placed on the sides of the boxes. All that said, had I been prepared for the presentation and load of info, I think I would have enjoyed it more."

It features impressively presented multimedia exhibits about Dutch life before, during and after the Second World War. Descriptions and annotations of the displays have English translations and if that isn't enough, your 8 Euro entrance (for adults) comes with a free podcatcher for audio descriptions. The museum covers the plight of Jews, Dutch collaborators, resistance fighters and even a special exhibit on the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and its fight against Japan. But what really stands out are the deeply-moving temporary exhibition of the Children's Camp, where pictures of children shipped from the Netherlands who died in the camp are posted on the walls; and the truly excellent Junior section of the museum which follows the tales of four children (and others) during and after the war. The displays are interactive and adults will surely learn a lot from this section, since the subject and presentation is far from \"kiddie\" or sanitized.You can easily connect a visit from Anne Frank to the Verzetsmuseum (or vice versa) by riding Tram 14, getting off at Artis and a short walk to the Resistance Museum itself. There are a lot of cafes around the area in case you need a meal afterwards."

Very poignant vignettes of a variety of people - young and old - and how they responded to the occupation. Panels are in English and Dutch.

At its most obvious level, the museum is about various ways, including collaboration, that Dutch citizens dealt with the Nazi occupation; joining the Resistance was only one way. The museum includes a significant and disturbing segment on responses in the Dutch East Indies to Japanese occupation. (All information is in English as well as Dutch, and it\u2019s touching, troubling and impressive. There is a single set of stairs to an area I found of minimal interest; I think some kind of elevator/lift is present, which I think was for wheelchairs. I didn't notice whether stroller parking exists.)I only accidentally wandered into the East Indies part of the exhibition\u2014when you enter the overall museum, you can turn left into this section (without yet clearly knowing what\u2019s there) or right into what seems the larger, main flow of the museum. When, after turning right and navigating the larger and powerful account of Holland\u2019s years under the Nazis, I finally turned into the Asian section and realized what it was about, I was struck by the darker side of Dutch wartime and postwar history\u2014the terrible irony that once free of the Nazis, and once the Japanese were driven from the East Indies, the Dutch government spent four years trying to hold onto its Asian colony in ways that were not always different from what the Nazis and Japanese had done. One of the effects of the Japanese occupation was to breed an anti-colonialist resistance movement, headed by the not-so-enlightened Sukarno, to ANY occupation, Japanese OR Dutch.Beyond their historically and geographically local themes, the Nazi and Japanese occupations say something much more universal about the variety of ways in which human beings deal with their lives being turned upside-down. (There may even be a parallel to the Kubler-Ross 5-stages-of-mourning.) There\u2019s certainly denial. For some there\u2019s acceptance, for others a desire to benefit from the occupation, for others resistance. Most people, presumably want to protect themselves and their loved ones without fully knuckling under to the occupier. We most admire the active resisters, but I suspect we\u2019re all tempted to less dramatic and less admirable responses when we confront the daily, seemingly endless challenges to our previous assumptions about life. The larger world is full of parallel examples. In the short run, there are places like Egypt, the Ukraine, the Crimea\u2014places vivid in our recent memories as potential locations of reversal in the midst of new norms. In the longer run, we might think of North Korea and its decades-long fate with no apparent end in sight, or interactions between Israelis and Palestinians, or nations like India or Ireland with internal religious conflict, or nations in today\u2019s world where millions of slaves continue to exist.And we might reflect on how these lessons, to the extent we can understand them, tell us about our own behavior on either end (are there only two?) of issues like how a national or local government should treat immigrants (especially during hard economic times) or marginalization of groups with behavior we consider fundamentally different from our own \u201cnorm\u201d (for example, people with different sexual proclivities). I encourage readers to come up with their own examples, and, as you move through this museum, to project yourselves into what it would be like to be part of a group different from your own self-identification."

There's also a flea market nearby which is worth a gander.The museum has quite long opening hours and I was pleased to see it wasn't excessively busy. There is a huge amount of information and a whole variety of displays to absorb here, we could have spent twice as long as we did. The museum chronicles the history of Dutch colonialism through to the Nazi occupation of 1940-45.I very much valued my time here, the display about the Jewish families and children sent to concentration camps was particularly thought provoking and extremely moving."

The Museum is just opposite the Zoo entrance and next to the Caf\u00e9 Plancius. Eight Euros seems very reasonable for such a well laid out history of resistance and triumph in WWII. Most of the exhibits have a recorded commentary and two presses on the button will generally change it from Dutch to English. There is an explanation in English on all exhibits but the typeface is small and some are dimly lit making them hard to read. Don't miss the cinema set in the middle where a German film and contemporary newsreels are shown. Having passed the end of the war turn into the War in the Far East where all Dutch citizens living in the overseas territories had a very rough time. Go early as this is not a suitable museum for crowds as all exhibits are in small windows and need individual attention."

It was about much more than the resistance, it was about how the Netherlands coped with Nazi occupation. Admirably, it did not shy away from detailing the less heroic aspects either,explaining about collaborators and even the dutch peoples less than admirable actions as Colonial occupiers in the East Indies.If you have time to do more than the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum this is definiately worth putting on your list.Just get a tram or bus to the zoo and it is on the opposite side of the road to the main entrance."

Some of the labels are too low to see. The restaurant is not one we felt comfortable in just to have a coffee or snack - it looked like people were dressed for dinner and we walked into the centre for a coffee after our visit. Having said those few negative things it IS worth a visit and the staff are very helpful. I am not sure we learnt much about the Dutch people and wonder if a few 'real' stories from people who lived through it would have been good also, actual interviews and speaking their own words. Museums like this should be encouraged and it's marvellous for the children to learn about the war, their section is excellent."

I would recommend seeing this museum before the Anne Frank house so that you have more background on the resistance before going to an even more focused subject-matter. If I have any comment on something to improve for this museum, it would be to improve the English titles on the displays. I can speak Dutch, so I was able to read more of the original signage, documentation, and personal letters. But the English titles on some of the displays did nothing to get to the detail of what was displayed, so I feel that I got a lot more out of it than your average tourist would. That's what I think some of the other reviews mean by the \"simplicity\" of the museum. Overall, I would highly recommend this museum to anyone visiting Amsterdam. I live in the Netherlands, and this museum is going on my \"must see\" list for visitors!"

The Verzetsmuseum is an interactive museum that captures the life of Dutch citizens during World War 2 in an impressive manner. The museum takes you from 1930 till the end of the war and shows the different choices people made during this period of time. I definitely recommend this museum if you're interested in World War 2 or want to learn more about the daily life of people between 1930 and 1950. If you take your time, visiting the museum will take between 3 and 4 hours. "

I felt I owed it to the people who led the resistance to visit it and I was not dissappointed. I took the audio tour which was about 90 minutes long and felt I got much more out of the exhibits than just reading the plaques. The downside of the museum was the layout was not so straight forward, but nothing major, I just had to back track a bit.the upside, was a lot of work had gone into it, they had different types of displays, and very informative. I was really glad I went. However you if you do the audio tour and press all the options (as I did) it will take you 90 minutes plus. So make sure you are not in a hurry."

A little out from the centre of the city via tram, it is quite near the zoo & also if you need a coffee/snack I\u2019d recommend the caf\u00e9 which is immediately to the left of entrance in the same building [can\u2019t recall name]. It details the plight of Amsterdam locals during the Nazi occupation of WW2 & how various groups decided to adapt [go about life as usual], resist [blatantly or with underground newspapers etc] or those that would essentially collaborate with Nazis but actually plot ways to rebel or not have their culture changed overly. There was a good timeline set out of the haves and have nots & divisions in Dutch society even prior to the Nazi invasion. The experience portrayed of the Jewish citizens & their gradual outcast descending into violence was very vivid & films & interactive displays also show this well, with many anecdotes from citizens at the time. I\u2019m not a natural museum lover but I found this really interesting & interesting to see the how Dutch were loyal to each other, supportive or often indifferent to Jewish suffering, & indeed, harsh & violent post WW2 to fellow citizens they perceived as traitors & Nazi aligned. I do not regret attending. Great perspective on the suffering resilience & cleverness of people during wartime & if you think you\u2019re having a bad day, think again I suppose"

It covers the armed resistance, capitulation, and those who just tried to get by. There is a lot of memorabilia from the time, posters, newspapers, personal papers. Some earlier posts complain about the lack of English, but I would disagree. All museum information signs are in both Dutch and English. There is also an English audio tour that is very informative. The original documents/posters are in Dutch of course, but I don't see that as a negative.There are sections dedicated to various political parties, religious institution response to the occupation, counterfeiting of documents and more. There is also an interesting room dedicated to WWII and the reaction of the Dutch West Indies, which is something I never thought of.You can take Tram 9 from Amsterdam Central Station, to the Plantage Kerklaan stop, about a ten minute ride. It is fairly easy to find, directly across from the entrance of Artis, the Amsterdam Zoo. The cost for an adult is 8 euro, and that includes the audio tour. It does accept the museum card.If you are interested in WWII, especially topics not often covered in main stream books, this is worth your time. Allow about two hours."

Audio guides were available but we found them uneccessary as loads of information was displayed in both Dutch and English.The story which is told is that of how a neutral country was suppressed in a few days by a the might of a militarily-superior neighbour.This is a warts-and-all story which explains how some people embraced the new regime, how most simply acquiesced, but also how others tried to make things difficult for the Germans. I learned about a food-shrtage which caused mass starvation, and how ordinary Dutch people were transported on trains in their thousands to work as forced-labourers in Germany.I found myself imagining what life in England would have been like if Hitlers Operation Sea Lion had been successful !The visit was well worth the effort of finding it You are not allowed to take bags into the museum but they provide free lockersAdmission is free if you have an \"I Amsterdam card\""

The Resistance Museum does a very good job putting a human face to the Nazi occupation of The Netherlands and always asks the question: should they have collaborated? adapted? resisted? What would you do faced with the same circumstances?You see the faces and stories of real Dutch citizens who were faced with that choice. It is easy to throw stones from a historical distance at the collaborators or those who simply adapted, but the museum does a very good job of presenting their stories and rationale as well. Physically, the museum is a winding path with windows (metaphorically and literally) into individuals' lives and choices, as well as short alleys that follow a particular story. Stories are told through artifacts, photos, writings, flip-boards, and video.At the end of the day, you are left with a sense of the scope and horror of the occupation, perhaps a desire to go hug the ones you love and make sure they are safe, and a deep appreciation of life in a time and place where you are not in danger of being killed because of your convictions or the circumstance of your birth.This is not really a light-hearted museum, but it is worth the time if you feel you should understand history.We would suggest allocating at least 3 hours."

So glad I did as it was well worth it. Shows the history of the Dutch Resistance and the plight of the Jews during WW2. I recommend visiting this museum prior to visiting the Ann Frank House. You cannot buy tickets anywhere other than at the museum as it is not advertised through the hotels or the main touring companies in Amsterdam, which is a shame really as many tourists will miss out on this gem if they don't know about Trip Adviser. I went on a Saturday afternoon and there was no que and not many people inside. A well kept delightful secret but more people should know about it. Go and enjoy, it cost 8 euros. Request a free talking recording and allow at least 90 mins to cover it all."

It gives a very good picture of life in wartime, occupied Holland, with all its wartime photographs. A lot of hard work must have gone into collecting everything and putting it all together.Unfortunately for English speakers, most of the exhibits (posters, leaflets, newspaper clippings) and their accompanying description-board are written in Dutch, with only summaries of the main ones translated into English. I would have derived a lot more from its wonderful display, if only I had been able to understand more of it. Sometimes, the significance of some exhibits \"Went over my head\" a bit. Still, it was interesting and very well laid out.It not quite as easy to reach and find as some of the big city-centre places, which are right on tram-routes. If you have a walking difficulty, this might mean walking a little bit further than you find comfortable; but it's nice when you get there.

Also the fact that Amsterdam had just gone through a major recession so conditions were ripe for joining the German movement.

There were photographs, videos and objects. It was put together in a way where a number of stories and issues were raised.At the end there was also information on the effect WWII had on overseas territories such as Indonesia.I would highly recommend this if you have the Amsterdam card. It is across the street from the botanical garden and zoo, and a couple of tram stops from the Rembrandt Museum and Jewish Museum- so you can put a nice tour together and hit many museums.We also visited the Anne Frank Museum and I would recommend the Resistance Museum over the Anne Frank museum given cost, lines and the general information/experience."

It is, in fact, a very balanced account of the three choices available to the people of this neutral country when they were overrun in 1939: collaborate, accept or resist. What would you do? It contains some stark mementos of that dark time. Particularly poignant are the hand-written notes dropped from the trains of transportation and the final words smuggled from the cells of those condemned to death. Take the free audio guide, particularly if you are English-speaking. Some of trigger points and the material described were a little difficult to locate.

Worth more than Anne Frank House in understanding what happened in many areas and circumstances. Well documented and presented. The Audio Guide is essential.But must read all the descriptions and listen to the stoties."

It looks at the different aspects of the Dutch Resistance during WWII and the issues the people faced. There is a recommended pattern to go through the museum (chronologically), however there are many different presentations (movies, poster boards, information boxes). It begins with a history before the war of the Netherlands and explains the different types of people ie. Socialists, Liberals etc. Then it goes into the war arriving in the Netherlands and the different resistance movements that began. They had different little shadow boxes with real peoples stories in how they personally resisted the Nazis. I found those quite informative. Overall the Museum has lots to see and if you want to fully experience it, expect to spend several hours here (we spent probably 3-4hrs and didn't ever realize it was that long until we left). It's too bad this Museum is not in the museum centre of town as people are unlikely to stumble across it. We made it the end of our Jewish Quarter Walk (Rembrandt House, Jewish Historical Museum, Synagogue) and felt it an appropriate end to the day. So make sure you plan it into your trip."

I first visited the Verztsmuseum in 1990, when it was housed in the middle of a residential area, and, I seem to remember, all in Dutch and Spanish (neither of which I speak) but nevertheless, it was fabulous! I was a little concerned it might have changed, and not for the better, but I needn't have worried' if anything, it was even better!Because we were on a bit of a schedule, we only spent two hours in the museum, but could have easily spent a lot longer. The ground floor focuses on the occupation of Holland during the Second World War, and the persecution of the Dutch Jews. The first floor (which we did not visit) focuses on the Dutch East Indies (I think).The exhibitions are well laid out, the testimonies moving and informative, and the whole museum is spotlessly clean. Audio guides are available, but we didn't use them. I'm just so glad the move and refurbishment haven't affected the museum, as I had such positive memories. I'm sure it won't be be another 23 years before I go back!"

The content is spectacular and the documentation, audio, and visual impact are extremely well-done. Following the whole chronology of the Netherlands during WW II, the material went way beyond what I'd expected to be the narrower focus on Dutch resistance. There was a tremendous amount of social and cultural context, as well as documentation (written and audio) of historical events. Given the relatively small space, this is also one of the best laid out and presented museums I think I've ever visited. A bonus was a special exhibition on the experiences of the Dutch and local people during Japanese occupation in the Dutch East Indies during the war, with a brief followup of post-war events as the Netherlands tried to hold onto its colonial status there as Indonesia fought for its independence. (I think may Americans forget, or do not know, that the Netherlands was once a major colonial power in the world, a perhaps not so sterling chapter in the country's history.) As other posters have said, I think the museum offers something for people of all ages, and is a \"must see\" for anyone with an interest in history."

You really get into the sobering aspects of what slowly was happening in Europe that exploded into Dutch society. The heartbreaking decisions that ordinary people had to make-- to live \"normally\" under the Nazi regime, or to clandestinely fight the Third Reich in the hopes that the Nazis would be driven out. The firsthand accounts of the Dutch, both Christians and Jews, and their plight and how they had to deal with their circumstances on a daily basis until the final Allied victory.Be sure you are rested and you give yourself plenty of time to see this museum.

In amongst the heart-wrenching, disgusting, frightening story of the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, and the Holocaust, was the story of how many, many, many people from all walks of life found ways to resist, fight back, escape, help and hide others and generally be their best human selves. It gave me a spark of hope in these dire times- when things get really bad, the good in people does rise. One lesson I took from it was the need to always teach critical thinking and to question authority from a young age (or learn it as an older person, whatever) - the extent to which the rather conformist, trusting-in-goodness Dutch (including some Jews) went along with the Nazis (who were clever in their manipulativeness) at the start of the occupation was interesting. This exhibit is well-organised, there are English interpretations and audio guides available, and the staff are friendly and helpful. Overall it does the job it sets out to do- tells the story of the Dutch resistance, and invites you to think about how you would respond."

The resistance is a big part of the Dutch experience, and it turns out to have been a very complex phenomenon. An appealing quality of the Dutch is their honesty about their history, and that infuses this museum too, with tales of informants and collaborators mixed in with the stories of heroism. If you don't want to make the 30-40 minute walk from the Center, take the 9 Tram. This is an excellent value-added experience on your Museumkaart."

My favorite parts were the installments depicting the espionage tactics the resistance used. There is real microfilm and trap doors preserved for viewing.The museum tried hard to make the exhibit interactive, but the sensitive nature of the artifacts and the limited resources make this difficult to achieve. It's not for the whole family as of right now, but they will be opening a children's wing soon.

This museum offers a powerful and detailed historical account of the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands and the efforts that brave Dutch citizens took to forestall or counteract the Nazi atrocities. The story is portrayed in chronological order so that you can better understand the course of events. At first, life went on more or less as usual, even though the queen had taken refuge in England, but gradually and horrifically, the Nazis imposed more and more restrictions on the people in general, but especially on the Jews. There are numerous personal stories of the efforts, large and small, to cope with or fight the oppressors. Display cases contain personal memorabilia and accounts of individual actions that had been taken. The fate of the individuals was provided. Many of the people in the resistance movement were killed. This museum was a fascinating education on this time in history and an excellent adjunct to a visit to the Anne Frank House."

There is a free audio tour available, but as others have said you might not be told about this. This was not mentioned to us when we bought our tickets & instead inquired with the other staff member handing them out (thanks to a tip from here warning of the tour). The audio tour gives far more information & access to background & information or stories. Depending how much information you read & take in I'd probably say you want 1-2 hours to visit."

If you have any interest in the second world war and especially intrigued by how a country survives under occupation this is a good place to spend some time. There are stories here of heroism; of reluctant 'heroes'; of compromise and then straightforward collaboration. It is a series of exhibits which try to capture the varied daily experiences of Dutch people and Amsterdammers in particular. The agonising decisions of those who reluctantly co-operated to attempt to ameliorate the worst excesses of Nazi occupation and the way in which the occupiers gradually became punitive. There were heart rending stories and overall it was a couple of hours well spent. Yes, there are some difficulties with translation if you have no Dutch (or for that matter, German) - but there are sufficient English language translations to make it clear what is going on, in fact most of the exhibits have adequate translations. The staff were helpful and there is to be a children's museum opening later in the year. Perhaps not a 'must' but well worth the time ..."

If we hadn't asked some one inside the museum, we never would have known. It would have been a 10 minute visit if we didn't have the gizmo, but with all the explanations we really enjoyed it. The exhibit was from the perspective of the average person....do they join the Nazi movement just to get along, do they try to stay under the radar, or do they actively resist? There were many examples of what different people did. I kept trying to think about what I would have done given what was at stake. I really enjoyed it, but customer service is nonexistent....although, this was the only place in Amsterdam that people were not friendly or helpful.

It's just by the zoo so you could combine a visit, but be aware that they don't accept all types of cards (i.e. visa is a nono which surprised us a bit).For the price (8 euros) it was a long visit of about two hours, spent reading and watching various things, tracking Jewish history until the modern day.

Then there are other exhibits in the center; again, each display showing authentic documents, newspaper articles, notes, objects, maps--all telling various stories of what went on in Holland at the time. The most interesting story was about how the Dutch themselves were torn into two factions: those who sided with the Nazis, and those who formed a resistance union and stood up to the atrocities. Of the 140,000 Jews who lived in Holland at the time, only 18,000 remained at the end of the war. Very moving, the audio stories are enlightening.

I loved the way this museum is arranged - the displays are creative, and draw you in. At the display of an actual house door and stoop, you stand and ring the bell. Then you hear recorded voices (in your chosen language) telling you why they have to turn you away. It is easy to imagine that you're terrified of being discovered and have nowhere to go. For many of the exhibits, you are peeking inside windows to see them, which gives you an added sense of the fear that must have gripped this nation. There are desk drawers and cabinets you can open to see documents or artifacts - which this little museum has a treasure trove of. There are actual notes thrown from transport trains, ration cards, a baby carriage with false bottom to accommodate the hidden transport of grenades and guns. Tiny notes written in code, wristwatches with hidden compartments, real and false passports for you to inspect and decide which are real. This is a very interactive museum. Most household items are shown in a natural setting. Many, many interesting things to look at - German helmets made into bedpans, printing presses used to produce illegal resistance newspapers, etc. No worries if you only speak English - everything is translated. I've been to many holocaust museums and for me, this little gem was the best of all. It really gave you a sense of what Holland was like under the Nazis. Good for children - there are so many things you can touch."

We are so glad we did. It is laid out very well and easy to navigate. It chronicles the time leading up to, during and after the Nazi's captured, brutalized and tried to break the Dutch people. It uses documents and original artifacts to tell the sometimes confusing story of a people that choose not to fight and die for their freedom and lost it. It lays out how the Jewish people were targeted by Hitler's regime for ridicule, torture and death. It offers a compelling case for sticking together and fighting for our freedoms. In the end the Dutch resistance stayed in the fight and welcomed the Allied troops as they fought and died for freedom for all. A true, eye opening and sober story worth learning about."

I only budgeted 1&1/2 hours and unfortunately felt hurried through the museum. I think one of the biggest short-comings of the museum is that I do not speak or read Dutch! I wish I did! The exhibits are very interesting. Some are originals and others reproductions. I just wish i had been able to read and understand them. Posters. Newspapers. Personal letters. Radio broadcasts. So, although small, I do not think this is one to rush through.From the Central Station, take tram #9 to the Plantage Kerklaan stop. From the Dam, tram #14. The museum ticket costs ~8 euros. That includes admission and a free audio guide as well as a free SECOND cup of coffee at the adjacent coffee shop."

Collaborate with the germans or be sent to the labour camps, if they tried to hide, the germans would hurt their families and they would still be sent to the labour camps. After being in the labour camps when it was all over they were shunned by their old neighbours because they had collaborated. What a choice! The museum is a chronological story over a number years and has personal stories of what happened to people during this time.It demonstrates another dimension to the second world war that we don't know about because we are not taught about it.There are stories about the resistance and spies (real ones) and what they did during the warThere are some humourous tales but you have to find them.

It wasn't a fair fight for little Holland and the museum will tell you all about that. But the central theme and question is, \"What would YOU do if the bad guys conquered your country?\" The Dutch answer to that question is this unflinching and critical review of the Dutch by the Dutch in the form of this fascinating museum.The Germans dissolved the legitimate government, crushed the labor unions, sent Dutch youth into forced labor in Germany, rounded up the Jews and the homosexuals and sent them off to concentration camps, looted the food supplies and even melted down their church bells to make war materials. The Gestapo arrested, tortured and killed Dutch citizens for even small acts of resistance.Some Dutch resisted in every way possible. And gave their lives for it. Some enthusiastically collaborated with the Nazis. And paid a price for it later. Some kept their heads down and tried to wait it out. Others passively resisted, or hid fugitives in their homes and businesses. This museum tells all of those stories and is a Dutch national exploration, sometimes heroic, sometimes not, of the ways in which people reacted to their occupation and brutal subjugation. My wife and I spent 3 very absorbing hours in this museum. We learned a lot. The Dutch are determined not to forget this episode in their history and the rest of us shouldn't either."

Definitely get a \"podcatch\" audio device, which has multiple stations throughout the museum where you can listen to recordings which sums up the some of the information in the displays. The museum is very well-organised with a fairly set route through the displays (chronological) which I really liked as I always feel like I'm missing something when I'm at museums if I don't check every nook and cranny! It took about 2 hours to get through all the displays thoroughly, though that could be cut down to 60-90 minutes if you skipped over some of the details. Highly recommended on a visit to Amsterdam!"

There is an accessible loo, and all the museum was easy to access in my wheelchair, and my carer got a reduced rate for pushing me.All in all, a good few hours and very enlightening into the lives of normal Dutch people at an horrific point in time."

What I expected was that their would be a lot of stories, exhibits and little known facts about the individuals who resisted the Nazi domination in Amsterdam during WWII. I did get some of that, but there weren't quite as many individual stories of heroism and daring that I'd expected. Moreso...and this isn't a bad thing at all, I came away from the museum with a better understanding of how the Dutch people came to capitulate to the Nazis. The process of domination was really well documented in this museum, and I could understand how people at first didn't realize what was happening, and how soon they were really trapped in a situation that they could either submit to or resist. The museum covered the policies that were established by the Germans to document, and track the people in the city...and how those that resisted early on were punished as examples. There were a few stories of individual acts of heroism and risk, but also a fair amount of space & time is devoted to the establishment of underground newspapers and really HOW the Germans established their domination. One issue I took with the museum is that it was all about how the Jews were persecuted...there was no mention whatsoever about the gays, the gypsies, the intelligensia and others that were also discriminated against and sent to camps. In a way, I felt that the museum presentation was less about Dutch resistance, but more about how the invasion and domination was implemented, and then oh, by the way, here are some stories of people who resisted and how. Perhaps this is even better than what I had expected, from an educational and understanding perspective, but it was a little different than I had expected. I'd also like to add that though the information was awesome, I found the layout a little confusing and distracting. Its a little like a maze & you're supposed to flow through it, but there were times I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go down this aisle or that next. I will also add that the woman at the front desk was a little surly, and not very welcoming. I entered with a large party (9), and this seemed to overwhelm her a little bit & she was really concerned about making sure everyone paid. We had every intention of paying, but she was kind of tense about it. I don't know if I'd go again, but I sure do want to learn more about the brave Dutch who risked their lives to oppose the Nazis."

But very well laid out, lots of exhibits, artifacts, documents, movies, and history. It is laid out in a chronological sequence and it flows nicely. I have heard lots of American and British perspectives on the war, but it was refreshing to get the view from the \"inside\" of what it is like being occupied and how much is possible to do for resistance. I enjoyed that they posed many ethics questions to think about, do you resist, adapt, or hide? And how they presented real life stories from people that had to grapple with extremely difficult decisions in that regard. We had this as a lower priority on our trip, but I would put it at the top because of how well done it was."

Just meander through, take everything in, and then have a conversation about what you think you would do, and why you think people did what they did at that time. The museum is in a nice, quiet location, yet it's easily walkable to center city. Or there's a tram that stops right by it too. There are a couple of nice cafes right outside too."

The museum follows the chronology of the war allowing you to understand the decisions that were being faced, and the descriptions were in both Dutch and English throughout. But two criticisms, firstly a lot of the writing was very small and angled making it quite hard to read. Secondly, although very descriptive of life in Amsterdam at the time, the actual stories of the resistance and their impact was not, but rather subsumed into the mass of detail. You could come away thinking that all the resistance did was print some leaflets, strike and provide hiding and escape routes whilst waiting for the liberation, very little about any direct actions."

The everyday life of the citizens becomes real and the personal stories (a must read) make it all too real. The very short stories are not all noble ones but stories of the average person.

Full of authentic period artifacts and ephemera from the period, it's an engaging exhibit that, while making the visitor wish she understood Dutch, provides more than adequate information in English for a speaker of that language to appreciate and interact with the materials on display.My cousin and I visited the Dutch Resistance Museum after we went to the Anne Frank House, and in some ways I think it would have beeb better to flip that order.

I was also amazed to see/hear the issues that were experienced prior/during/after World War 2 by the Netherlands but also in their Asian colonies. As the exhibits were in Dutch and English we had no problems and I did notice a couple with audio units so the museum may offer them for other languages. Overall an informative 2 hours."

The museum is much quieter than the tourist-clogged Van Gogh and others--there were very few people there. The museum is fascinating, and the story of the Dutch Resistance during World War II was full of impressive information I never knew. There were many short films and lots of exhibits and memorabilia. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone visiting Amsterdam."

The history was very well presented, with just the right amount of text (informative, but not a wall of text you get tired of reading). It really explored what the resistance went through during the war, which you would probably never hear of otherwise. Everyone at the museum was nice, and the facilities are all new and quite clean. It's a bit out of the normal sight-seeing area, but still a short tram ride and not hard to find at all. Highly recommended."

That many showed bravery is beyond doubt, but the nagging feeling that it must have been so easy to turn a blind eye is always present. The overwhelming question is:- should leaders retain power in order to try to mitigate excesses or simply resign and hand over to Nazi sympathisers?It takes a very brave person to decide to retain some local power whilst being denounced as a puppet of the occupying regime.

Many artifacts, historical documents, photographs, and sound recordings are on display and I loved how these were organized into montages for the difference time periods and themes. I loved how the exhibit provided both objective, general information about the events of the war as well as individual stories and memoirs that were used to convey the realities of the time.

This museum, located in the Plancius Building, (near the zoo, which was forbidden to Jews during the German occupation), has 2 permanent and 5 temporary exhibits on various historical themes per year. It has recreated streets and large photos that try to recreate the war years in Holland. There are letters, photos and film fragments that give small stories to the horrible backdrop of German occupation. I had the honor to meet a man in his 70s who was hidden as a 4 year old, who was grateful, but more honest about the percentages and numbers of real resistance, especially during the first 3 years of the war. His father and siblings were in hiding at another location, but were betrayed by Dutch neighbors and were sent to the death camps...only his mother survived the war. He, and many historians, feel that The Netherlands, France, et al...highly exaggerate the numbers and percentages of real resistance to the Germans and genuine help for their Jewish neighbors. Holland had one of the highest rates of Jewish selection, interment and murder of most European countries...even though it had a long history of tolerance for centuries. Many, many Dutch were nazi sympathizers or simply ignored what was happening to their Jewish neighbors...shame. There were true Dutch heros who resisted, hid Jews and did deeds above and beyond the call of normal citizens...but, not the high numbers eluded to..."

We originally put aside 1 hour for this museum yet when we left 3 1/2 hours later we felt as if we just lived through all the history that we viewed and read. I am always thrilled to learn things about which I had no idea and this museum supplied more than its share. Simply incredible and a bit draining from an emotional standpoint as well. Do not rush through the exhibits (which is sometimes hard to follow as they twist and turn and are hidden in every nook and cranny of the museum's space) and make sure to watch the videos. Since it is not full of tourists you are free to let it all seep in and when you leave you can maintain that feeling by walking through some very quiet residential areas."

The Anne Frank House gets the press and the crowds, but this museum gets to the real core of the events of the 1930s and 40s. It has so much more information and a wealth of the historic events, as well as poignant and impressive stories. It would be very easy to spend 2 hours or more here if you read everything. It's a great exhibit of the ability of humans to be incredibly cruel, and the astounding strength and determination of people who are confronted with that evil. An absolute must for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of WW II and the Holocaust! The entry fee is free with the Museumkaart."

It turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. It was easy to take a tram from the Rijksmuseum and then walk a bit (and we found a delicious cafe, Kosje, on a nearby corner). What looks like a small museum from the street is actually quite large, and includes an enormous number of artifacts from the war years. The displays date to 1998-9, I believe, and are not particularly modern looking. But they are well arranged, setting the scene in the Netherlands in the 30s, then moving on through developments during the war years. Throughout, the viewer is nudged to think what you would do in response to each German action: adjust, resist, or collaborate. It is sometimes painful, often provocative, and definitely worth a visit. A big help: the labels are all in English as well as Dutch."

I have been to many different sites dealing with WWII history in different countries (Germany, France, England, Latvia etc.) and each has their own story to tell and each has it's own story to be remembered. This museum is exactly for that. It is put together quite well and really gives a feel to the struggle the Dutch people went through and really shows how much they tried (and in some ways succeeded) to hold onto their own culture and heritage. The stories of people risking their own lives and those of their families to try and help others (Jewish and non-Jewish) make you realize that even in the face of terrible circumstances people can still do the right thing. The only thing that left me with a weird feeling was the last portion of the museum when it was dealing with the liberation there was no mention of the Canadian soldiers who were the main forces who liberated the country when the majority of the Allied forces were making their way to Germany / Berlin. As a Canadian I am extremely proud of the veterans who fought in this war. There were UK (which is probably where we were lumped into), French, even Russian flags but not a Canadian flag. Of course this is not what the museum is about but when many Dutch people consider the Canadians as the ones who finally freed them German occupation you would think a flag in that museum would not be too much of a gesture. There is a monument to the Canadian soldiers elsewhere in Amsterdam so the Canadians sacrifice is recognized but I think it should also be mentioned at this museum too."

The context setting of Dutch society before the war helps to explain the actions that took place during the war years. The museum does a great job of explaining the impact of the war on individuals and what it was like to be occupied by a foreign power. It felt like a very honest account of how difficult it was for individuals to pick sides and decide how much to resist. The museum is probably more suited to adults and older teenagers. There's not a lot of interaction for younger children who would not read the descriptors. Very vivid and informative but perhaps not for the whole family."

The museum documents life in Holland from the time the Germans first invaded and the birth and subsequent activities of the Dutch Resistance Movement. Visitors will get a sense of the German brutality and the hard choices made by the Dutch in their efforts to resist. This museum brings home the realities of war, occupation, and oppression by ruthless invaders. You will come away with a sense of appreciation and respect for the bravery, commitment, and sacrifice of those who made the choice to resist and you will ask yourself, \"What would I have done?\""

It shows every day life that got more and more difficult through those years. It shows the gradual de-humanisation and eventually deportation of the Jewish population. It shows those who were cowards and did not stand up against the evil of the nazi's. And it shows the courage of those to whom this museum is dedicated: the men and woman of the dutch resistance. (verzet). There are many original artefacts that are sometimes moving like the letters sent home from concentration camps. The signs at the exhibits are both in dutch and english. The museum is only \u20ac 7,50 and is opposite the entrance of Artis, the Amsterdam Zoo. All-in-all well worth the visit. And don't miss the picture at the end of the exhibition.

A lot of the displays are seen through peep holes or slivers of glass, so sometimes it can make it harder to see, if it was busy i should imagine it makes it very difficult indeed.

It was fascinating how one banker started a system of fraudulent bank notes and was able to funnel millions into the resistance effort. He was ultimately discovered, but his use of fraudulent bank notes and the system all the financiers used to fund the resistance would make any greedy banker happy today. Fortunately the money they gleaned off the system all went to to arming and providing for resistance fighters, so it was used for the common good. We spent at least 2 hours in there.

I found it a really interesting and informative place, It details the various ways the people of Holland supported the Jewish community by organizing various workers strikes, hiding people and arranging scams so they could get money. There was also a very touching display of a tiny Christmas tree that was made in one of the concentration camps using bits of the floor boards as branches and snow that was actually part of a bandage from a gunshot wound.

As such, am very familiar with how incredibly the country suffered. And I must say was a tad disappointed. Much of my nit-picking is due to semantics. In other words, the museum talks about \"agents\" and the \"resistance\" when most people don't know the difference. Many think it is one and the same, therein lies a huge problem. My uncle was an SOE trained agent who was dropped (parachuted) twice into occupied Holland. His second mission was to organise the many Resistance groups under one umbrella/unit to have coordination/cohesion once the Allies liberated. It was mass confusion in reality and admittedly hard to depict in photographs. There was no mention of SOE (Special Operations Executive...SOE, the USA branch was the OSS precursor to CIA.) Some of the facts are incorrect and/or unclear but that is the way it was depicted. There were more than 10 Resistance groups and all had different functions and ideas. Therein is another confusion. Admittedly, I do not speak or read Dutch very well, my father insisted on teaching me more frequently spoken languages (French, Spanish etc.,) so somethings may be lost in translation. Overall would give the exhibit a \"B-\". Some of the films and photos were hard to decipher. Someone at the museum needs to do some research on recently declassified documents (National Archives Kew) and update some of their facts. This does not take away from the actual exhibits especially for those who know nothing. The Dutch suffered more than any other country overrun by the Nazis: lost more people per capita than any other Western European country, out of the Jewish population of appx 250,000 only about 6,000 came back or survived. I highly recommend this exhibit overall but some updating is needed or we should start a fund to help because none of us should every forget."

Dovetailing nicely with a visit to the Anne Frank House, the Resistance Museum also proveds an excellent overview of one of the signature moments in the country\u2019s history. The walking tour between the two attractions is in my mind an integral part of the Resistance Museum experience. I started the walk to the Resistance Museum at the Anne Frank House, and after an excellent visit there purchased a guided walk pamphlet in the gift shop for 0.5 Euros. Taking about 1 \u00bd hours, the walk takes one on a journey through the heart of Amsterdam past historically significant sites such as the soup kitchen used during the hunger winter and the site of the Groot shooting. The small pamphlet gives fairly thorough explanations of these events and, quite surprisingly, the buildings are still very much in existence and easily found. I found the guide very easy to follow and kind of felt like I was on a private walking tour. The tour continues through the Waterlooplein and the Plantage, with an emotional visit soon after at the deportation site before stopping at the Resistance museum proper.The museum itself stands alone as worthy of a visit whether one chooses to do the walk or not. Admission is 7.5 Euros and I was offered a complimentary audio/visual guide that the museum is trialing as they continue to upgrade the overall experience. After a brief introductory exhibit on the financing of the Resistance, the permanent exhibit starts through a pair of doors. Starting from an overview of Dutch Society in the 1930s and continuing chronologically in a counter-clockwise fashion, the main exhibit touches pretty much every main event, personality, and concept in the Dutch Resistance from May of 1940 until the end of the War. The audio/visual guide was valuable but not essential, adding emphasis to certain topics. There were artifacts, interactive exhibits, and even old radio broadcasts that you could listen to at the press of a button. The exhibits end with a brief description of the Dutch Colonial Empire focusing on the Dutch East Indies. Interspersed through the main hall are mini-exhibits (Help? Strike? Boycott?) that really put you in the shoes of the people at the time. In an era when people consider not getting a sunroof on their new car a \"sacrifice,\" the museum gently suggests that you ask difficult questions about the events in question and provide your own answers. In my five-and-counting years of travel I can count on one hand the number of museum that I have literally lost track of time while touring and this is one of them. An excellent experience and one that demands many repeat visits."

Reasonably priced for an Amsterdam museum, and included in the Amsterdam city card. Not too crowded, you have the time and space to take in the museum at your own pace. All exhibitions are labelled in Dutch and English, and the history of occupied Amsterdam is told movingly and realistically. There is also an area looking at the Dutch Indies during the war. The museum also features temporary exhibitions, at the time of visit including the work of a Dutch wartime artist and an exhibition on football (very engaging as well). Family friendly (themes permitting) with interactive features scattered throughout the galleries. Overall, think it was fantastic experience and would look forward to going again."

For those of us that grew up in the United States, and were born in the period after World War II, we really have no idea of what it was really like to live through a war taking place right where we lived. Movies are always going to be glorified in some way, but this is the very first museum I have ever gone to that really put into a terrible perspective just how terrible it was for the people that had to go one with their daily lives during the war. (notwithstanding the Anne Frank House, which focuses on the atrocities that happened to one family) The Dutch had a very active resistance movement, and it is quite rare to meet any Dutch people of a certain age that did not know someone or have a family member that was part of the Resistance. We always think that we, of course, would do the \"right thing. That we would be able to resist torture if it meant turning in our neighbors. That we would be able to easily do espionage when the risk meant not only you getting shot, but your children one by one if you got caught. If you were caught, that meant watching your neighbors being killed in front of you as punishment. We can't imagine this, it has never happened to us. But it did happen to the Dutch people. They had to make some terrible choices. What other reviewers have mentioned that I also found to be the most compelling about this museum was that it really did make you question exactly what your choices would be, and make you realize that there were no easy choices, and all bore terrible consequences. If you are interested in the World War II era, this is definitely a place that is not to be missed. Younger children would find a lot of this information incomprehensible, this is really a \"thinkers\" museum."

It's put together in a unique format with a timeline describing how the Dutch people reacted to each stage of the invasion and occupation, giving you a very good feeling for the actual events of the time. The museum is then broken out into different sections so you could get a feel for how the invasion and occupation affected different groups of society: Jews, Protestants, Liberals and so on. Fascinating and well put together.It was also a great prelude to visiting the Anne Frank Museum, as it really lays the groundwork for better understanding the Frank's situation while in hiding in Amsterdam."

This is one of the best museums on this topic I have ever been in. Not too large, but packed with period detail, the museum sets up the premise: what would you have done in the Nazi occupation: adjust, collaborate or resist? With hindsight, we often assume that we would have resisted, but would we really? The museum starts by showing you what life was like in the Netherlands in the Thirties, then takes you chronologically through the events of the occupation, going into greater detail on particular themes as you go round. What made it so special, and in some cases heartbreaking, for me were all the personal accounts: snippets of detail about individual people's experiences and actual artefacts from the period. There was also a great temporary exhibition about love in wartime. This museum really made me think and is a fantastic and non-judgmental testament to the people who lived through the occupation."

It is in a new facility and has pictures, posters, videos of life back in 1940-45, and areas of what everyday life was like back then. We spent over an hour going through every area, and it is worth the time. I just can't explain how effective it is. The time and effort spent on putting all this together is mind boggling! We did take a tram number 14, from where we were but walked back to city central. Make sure you take time to visit the Hollandsche Schouwbutg , which was once a theater but today a war memorial, with an exhibition inside. It commemorates the many thousand Jews who during WW11 were deported from this place and sent to be killed. Just ask at the front desk of the Museum where to find it. We saw it on the way to the Museum but didn't know what it was. It will make a nice addition to the Ann Frank House/Museum if you have time to see that.The front desk gals, at the Museum were very helpful in telling us where to eat lunch and other details."

Large scale events, like strikes and student demonstrations, were well covered, but I was hoping for a look at individuals and everyday actions that aren't in every history book. I was a bit disappointed to see things highlighted on the website (i.e. baby buggies with false bottoms and watches with a secret space for messages) and not have any accompanying stories about those who used them. Great for history buffs, but not quite as unique a perspective as I had hoped to see."

I am a resident of Amsterdam (though British) and like most people who live and work in places that are heavily visited by tourists, they never really go to the museums very much. I write quite a lot on the forum so I decided it was time to rectify this and on a very windy and wet afternoon I trekked off to the Verzetsmusuem for a look around. Entrance is 6.50 euros at the time of writing (free entrance with the IAmsterdam card) and the museum can be easily reached via tram line 9. Get off at the stop for the Artis Zoo, Plantage Kerklaan.Currently at the entrance to the museum they have an exhibition of photographs of native prisoners forced by the Japanese to work on the Burmese railway as they are today. Once inside the main part of the museum there are exhibits with both Dutch and English descriptions. One thing to note is that the museum is not that big but if you stop to read everything it can take some time to get round. I spent two hours and could not look at absolutely everything as it was nearly closing time.The exhibits starts with life in Amsterdam in the late 1930\u2019s before the German occupation of May 1940 of the then neutral Netherlands and then concentrates on how firstly the Germans tried to win the hearts and minds of the Dutch but then showed their true colours with the treatment of the Jews and other people not sympathetic to their views. Continuing on through the forced deportation to the camps and focuses quite a lot on the national strike by workers in 1941 in protest at these actions. There are examples of false papers printed for Jews who were taken in by the Dutch and I presume a real printing press. The trail finishes with the end of the occupation by the Allied forces.That\u2019s the factual info now here\u2019s my opinion of the museum. Well worth a visit if you want to learn more about life under the NAZI occupation. It is quite dark inside and does somewhat transport you back to those days, especially the interactive exhibits. I do think that they would be better using those headsets that you see at many museums these days so they you can get specific commentary at each point without disturbing anyone else. Presently everything is played through speakers which can be a bit loud in an enclosed space if you have not reached that part yet.Seems that the museum is not very busy although I think that there are quite a few school parties, one was leaving as I got there."
