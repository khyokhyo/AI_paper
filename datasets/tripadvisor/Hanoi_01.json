            "review": "Great way to know Vietnam. I booked private tour - me and a guide alone for 3 days' trip. I was a little worry because I didn't drive motorcycle for many years but I decided to go for it.It is my 3rd time in Vietnam but it was the first time I really get to know the real Vietnam.The guide (Mr. Thon) picked me from my hotel exactly on time and took me to the office in Hanoi there I met Mr. Chung which was the man how deal with me by e-mails before. After short meeting I got some explanation about the tour and I choose helmet and gloves I got 250cc Honda almost new (9000km) and we were on the way to our first day. By the next 3 days we drove some hundreds of km (about 600km) on many kinds of roads and off-road. Crossed valleys / mountains/ rivers and villages passing through tea/ rice/ corn/ sugar cane and some other kind of fields we visited many markets and met a lot of local village people. All time Thon the guide checked that I'm o.k. and offered me some option of roads to choose according to my will. Mr. thon was so patient and never rushed me to go on even I made many many stops for photos (I did really many stops) During the 3 days all expenses (beside 1 hotel I choose to upgrade) ware paid by the guide. I never needed to take my wallet out even not once including buying cold drinks / coffeeOn the last day when we got back to the office I got SD card free of charged with all the video files Mr. Thon filmed during the trip with his Gopro on his helmet (some of the roads and some of me riding) For sure I'll do it again with Vietnam Motorbike Tour Expert but next time it will be longer"

            "review": "Unforgettable. Did a 10 day trip with 3 other mid 50 yo plus mates to the North and North East of Hanoi. From start to finish, Chung was prompt with emails and the entire admin process was smooth. We rode 250's, although none of the riding was too much for the 150 that our guide rode. In fact if you're on the short side (say 175 cm or less) or less experienced you would be better on the smaller bike. Accommodation was mostly hotels with 2 homestays. All apart from 1 were clean (I believe that will be sorted) and comfortable. Hot showers everywhere. The food was plentiful and no one suffered more than could be expected given the radical diet change. The longest days were around the 230km mark, averaging about 180km. Our group found it reasonably tiring due to the high levels of concentration required to ride safely given the Vietnamese penchant for overtaking on blind corners and hills together with the poor standard of roads and the many 'obstacles' wandering around. All part of the adventure though. Our guide Thon was very good and was always making sure we were happy and well fed and watered. We had a back up vehicle for our gear which is essential unless you are happy in the same clothes for 10 days. We were able to do washing at 1 stop. Road conditions range from good sealed freeways to goat tracks along the side of mountains (you can opt out of the more extreme riding. You dictate the route to some degree). Traffic is frenetic at times and there is no doubt it has a degree of danger about it. We met fellow travelers with no previous riding experience but I would think their itinerary would be less rushed and therefore safer.We had 1 and a half rain days but it was never cold. Wear light armour and take a rain jacket with you on the bike. Summer gloves were best for our ride. The people are very friendly and constantly waving as you ride by. Plenty of low fives from the children. The whole experience is a sensory overload. Take a go pro or similar on the helmet if you want although the guide/s take vision which you get at the end. Wi-fi is available absolutely everywhere. We didn't bother to get a local sim card and managed fine. Hardly saw a mosquito anywhere but take a DEET spray anyway. Take half as many undies as days as you can easily wash in the shower. (same with socks) and they dry overnight with the air con and fan on. 2 x shorts, 2 x dark shirts, riding gear and maybe a pair of jeans, thongs and trainers. Unless you're doing a full off road trip, a full face helmet is best. Even the sealed roads are dusty. If I did another trip, I would have had a rest day, with no riding, in the middle of the trip. I reckon anything over about 7 days is getting to the stage of needing a break in the middle (maybe not for the young of course).I haven't wanted to sugar coat the trip - it is challenging, but it will be one of the best and most memorable experiences of your life. I don't believe there could be a better mob to do it with than Chung and his team if you are considering it. And ask for the tee shirt - I'm expecting a commission!"

My friend Demi and I chose a three day tour with Chung, we were worried because of our lack of experience with riding bikes, however, Chung tailored the tour to our needs, making sure that we were safe on the roads yet still had an exciting time on the motorcycles. Our guide Lee always watched out for us and lead us through the most stunning, sublime countryside, far from the crazy streets of Hanoi, into the mountains where green peaks rose majestically over lush fields and lakes and friendly people and children waved and shouted 'hello'. The motorcycle tour was the best part of my trip around SE Asia by far! Thoroughly enjoyed it and can highly recommend it to anyone who loves adventure! Will now be get some more biking experience so we can come back and do a longer tour off road with Vietnam Motorbike Tour Expert.Thank you Chung and Lee and Demi! Anna x"

In fact, I was already planning my next trip with VMTE before the end of our first day.Chung and his team really know exactly what they're doing, to plan a fantastic (and safe!) trip that is catered to your wants and needs. From the moment we contacted them about the tour to after we had said our goodbyes, their friendly and thoughtful service was impeccable.The trip itself exceeded expectations... After leaving the smogginess of Hanoi, we had a slow but interesting build-up to some truly spectacular scenery. I will never forget some of that countryside or the smiles of the local people. And this was all whilst experiencing the exhilarating excitement of being on a motorbike!In regards to our tour guide, Lee, you really knew you were in safe hands. And personally, it was really inspiring to be in the company of someone who was living their dream.Overall, I believe that there is only one way to experience Vietnam, and that is on a motorcycle. You really can't go wrong with Vietnam Motorbike Tour Expert - they will look after you and by the end, you will end up thinking that you should pack your job in, buy a bike and go see the world..."

These guys really know their stuff and planned everything to a T for us.Unfortunately we had to cut our planned trip extremely short and fly back home but Chung and Johnny fixed us up for a night in a hotel and arranged a day trip near Hanoi for us at very short notice.What little time we did have with Johnny we really enjoyed. The riding was great fun and experience won't be forgotten. When we return, we shall contact Chung again and organise our trip around the North."

Riding for 5 days in the north-west was the highlight of the my 2 weeks vacation in Vietnam. Words cannot describe how amazing the whole trip has been, from eating with the locals and the stunning landscapes, (drinking more vietnamese coffee than I should have), having fun off-road, ...and a great crew to share the adventure with. I honestly couldn't have asked for something better, once in a lifetime experience!Planning to go back and explore the north-east!You guys rock!"

I was fortunate to tag on last minute to a group of guys doing a 5 day tour up to the north of vietnam..it was the most incredible experience. 5 days full of technical riding, unique and beautiful landscapes, and some awsome people to share it all with. I was the least experienced but was well taken care of with expert guidance from our talented tour guide Vuong (the Tiger). He ensured we were safe and at all times enjoying the whole experience. We were provided with quality bikes and equipment which handled the terrain and me effortlessly.I can say whole heartedly we got to see and experience the real vietnam from the sights and food to the people along the way.A massive recommendation from me for the guy's at vietnam motorbike tour experts, Mr Chung for all the organising and Mr vuong for his unforgettable tour. You guys are legends I'll definitely be back!"

            "review": "We will talk about this amazing trip for a long time. My wife and I, in the 55+ range, decided after a conversation with our daughter and her partner who had recently been to Vietnam, that a motorbike tour was the thing to do. After some internet research, and based on great reviews we decided to contact Chung and book a 4 day trip. Chung was excellent with his emails and organisation. We decided on a Honda CRF 250, as I am quite tall and my wife was riding pillion. Due to our daughter's photos and stories, we rocked up in our running shoes and shorts! Chung didn't bat an eyelid but probably thought \"what a couple of wallies\"! Our guide was Tung and he was absolutely brilliant. He looked after us every step of the way. The tour was fantastic with a good range of highway and back roads. We feel we saw a great deal of the \"real\" Vietnam. The people were so friendly, the food was wonderfully delicious (in fact what we have been eating after that, just doesn't have the flavour or range). Tung made sure we had plenty of water, rest stops and food. He was a very good people person, always happy and easy to be around. Two of the nights were at home stays which again really added to the whole experience. Would recommend this company to anyone who wants an adventure. Would definitely do this again with a couple of mates and leave the ladies at the Hotel Spa and shops. Can't recommend our experience enough. Thank you Chung and Tung."

Where do i start?Hanoi going north to the Chinese boarder on near new Honda 250 dirt bikes and then looping back to Hanoi.6 days of absolute fun and pleasure with a great bunch of mates and the best tour guide you could have wanted - Johny :-)We saw parts of the North that only locals knew about. Stayed at Farm Stays and hotels with everything included in the cost except beer. I did put on 5kg and know it was the Hanoi draft beers :-)The Owner Chung, is such a nice man and just wanted us to see and experience Vietnam and love our time there. He succeeded there and i was overcome by the warmth, friendliness and generosity of the Vietnamese people. So happy and welcoming.We were escorted on the tour by Johny (his english name and had something to do with..... you better ask him:-) and were very lucky to have him as our guide. Local knowledge and an eye always on us to make sure no one was left behind. We saw a little of Vietnam and i so want to go back and see more. And it will be with these guys and their perfectly maintained near new bikes.Thanks again Johny and Chung. You made our trip a life long memory."

I rode an XR 150 while my girlfriend sat pillion with our guide, Chung. I was a little apprehensive of the Hanoi traffic at first but it was only short ride on the busy roads and having a decent bike definitely makes a difference. After leaving Hanoi we rode through rice paddies, visited beautiful Pagodas, stopped for lunch (loads of local food we hadn't tried in the city) and visited a number of different villages. Chung was a true expert with an extensive knowledge of the local history to share. We finished the day feeling that we had really learned a lot and experienced the real Vietnam. I was glad we booked with VMTE rather than one of the hostels or shops that rent scooters - quality bikes and a quality guide made the day a highlight of our trip. Thanks Chung!"

Myself and 4 other friends came to Hanoi looking for something unique to do, and stumbled upon this tour. From start to finish, the service was some of the best we have ever experienced, and our organizer and guides Chung, Tan and Quang did everything within their ability to ensure a smooth and safe trip. I would also say that to fully appreciate the beauty of Hanoi, one should definitely travel into the country around the rivers, hills and lakes and this tour is an exciting and fun way to do so. We stopped every so often to take in the beauty of the scenery and to take photos. The food at every meal was also exceptional; on our particular route we stayed at a Tai minority village in Mai Chau for a one night homestay and the food was simply incredible and just so fresh, as it was sourced from their very own farms. If I were to come back to Vietnam in the future I would definitely do this again. Don't miss this experience!"

            "review": "12hrs in Hanoi. My wife and I had a 12hr stopover in Hanoi Airport, so we decided to make the most of our short sojourn in Vietnam and organise a motorbike tour to see as much of the countryside and city as possible. Chung was flexible with our request and arranged for a airport pick up following our early morning flight into the city. We were both non-bikers so we rode on two bikes with Chung and Katie driving.We did the Countryside Tour which was a great was to see the rice paddy fields and enjoy the scenery of Vietnam. Our guides did a good job of explaining everything and checking in with us to make sure we were ok.Despite us being tired from a 10hr flight they did well to show us the country side life and scenery. We never felt unsafe on the road, nor did we feel that our guides didn't know the area. We planned to meet Chung's relatives but unfortunately we ran late and they were all asleep for the afternoon siesta!All in all, if you have one day to experience Vietnam this isn't a bad shout. Chung provided great local advice and insight, even helping out with food recommendations as well as dropping us off at the water puppet theatre. He also arranged for a taxi to pick us up from central Hanoi and take us back to the airport.Pros:- Flexible- Good local knowledge- Safe and reliable, bikes well maintained- Friendly on the ground and great communication prior to arrival via email- Chung made a GoPro video of our trip and sent it over to us afterwards as a nice memento of our time, very thoughtful!Cons:- Personally it became a bit of rice-paddy-overload after a while, consider mixing with a city tour, or having more variety by going around other places if you have more time.- Food was a bit limited during the tour, we asked for veggie but didn't get many options."

Prior to our trip, we were liaising with Chung via email and he was very informative and responsive. He made sure we were comfortable with his recommendation before we made the deposit. When we arrived in Hanoi and met up with him, he let my boyfriend try a couple of bikes to see which he prefers and is more comfortable in riding. On the tour itself, our guide Hoan was generous, accommodating and of course friendly. He offered to pay for many of our drinks during pit stops, even though it wasn't included in the package. Hoan also brought us to try a variety of Vietnamese cuisine and always asked what we felt like eating. At our last homestay, we were privileged to stay and meet Hoan's family who very warmly welcomed us with delicious homecooked food and rice wine. Overall, we had an exceptional experience and meeting Chung and Hoan made it a memorable one. :) Hope to see you guys soon!"

From the moment we were collected from our hotel in Hanoi by Lead Guide, Jonny, you felt comfortable and could see that he knew what he was doing. We were taken to the head office by bus and then the bikes were all lined up outside the workshop. .........12 fresh CRF250L's ...and it started. The lead guide, Jonny and Hoan, his second in charge were incredilble, as was Chi the tours mechanic........there was nothing he could not sort out. He was lubing the chains of all the bikes at regular intervals, changing tyres without hesitation. The trip took us through all types of sceney and terrain, much of which i would have missed if I'd done it by myself. There was nothing that Jonny or the guys wouldn't do for you. The accommodation was all organised as was the meals. The support truck was never far behind, this allowed us to not have gear on the bikes (highly recommend this ). The 14 of us from our tour have only had positive things to say about how well organised Jonny, Hoan, Chi and the team were. None of us wanted it to stop and are already talking of another trip. If you are wanting to to do a motorcycle tour of the real Vietnam on quality bikes, you need to check this company out. Chung, the owner of Motorcycle Tour Expert, runs a high quality adventure business, with excellent staff.I will definitely do another tour with this company. Jono.T. Wollongong. NSW. Australia. "

Starting with the easy reservation by email and only small reservation fee me got already excited at this time. Arriving at the shop we saw the almost new Honda 250ccm bike. Also for free we got helmet, knee & elbow safer and gloves. After about 30 minutes we started and after another half hour we left busy Hanoi behind us. Great streets abroad HW's with almost no traffic. On the old streets u really can enjoy the sceneries and views. We stopped every hour for drink or eating. Perfect timing and also great for my wife. After the 1st day she started to love our trip. Wife happy - husband even more happy. All the stopps for drinking, eating and sleeping was great. Best of all was our homestay at last day. Eating, drinking with the family and also enjoyed the homemade rice wine. Be careful of the tiger (husband homestay) :-) he will try to make ur drunk. Little headache in the morning and abit tired but it was our last day and we drove back after 4 awesome days on the bike. Thanks to our guide. We could see alot and also interesting storys about Vietnam. We been safe in all ways... never afraid about the route and never had danger time. The bike was in great shape and easy to drive. If u wanna do it also... don't think only about it... do it with this guys. Now we are waiting for our vid the did on the trip."

The guide Ton and mechanic Do and support driver were all fantastic. Looking after inexperienced riders, adjusting the exact roads covered based on our interest and experience. Good system and experienced on Vietnam's busy roads - ensuring we all made safe overtakes and got the distance covered each day. They were excellent in making sure we were all sorted in hotels each day and fed and watered. Even helped with getting our last night accommodation (after the tour) booked and getting our laundry booked in with the hotel. Much lower cost than some other options. Accommodation standard very good, except for 1 location. Food standard excellent. Exceptional value and a well run operation - thanks guys."

We were really sick on the last day and Johnnie offered to have a truck come pickup the bikes so we could just rest. He was very kind and compassionate towards us.

Before we even arrived I could tell that the owner, Chung, was acutely focused on customer service. He provided a variety of recommendations specifically tailored to the time we had available and the sights we were interested in seeing. I changed the dates, number of riders, and sizes of bikes numerous times, and not once did he complain or show any frustration. On the contrary, he happily adjusted to every request! All of the prices were clearly discussed in advance and there were no hidden fees or needless attempts to up sell. It made the entire administrative process relaxing and enjoyable. They would get 5 stars based on their customer service alone.Our guide, Vuong, picked us up at our hotel, showed us to their office and fitted us with all of the necessary gear and a few extras that some of us hadn't prepared for (rain gear that was essential later in the trip!). The bikes are almost new and in great condition. That being said, Vuong brought a tool kit and performed preventative maintenance on the bikes every day in order to ensure we had a safe ride. You won't have to worry about a thing.The ride itself was magnificent! We worked our way through the Hanoi traffic, along side streets, through banana groves, and quickly found ourselves on dirt roads and paths through isolated parts of the country. We were surrounded by loads of animals, waving children, friendly faces, and breathtaking scenery. The only recommendation I would make for you as a customer is to make sure you're comfortable on a motorcycle/dirt bike. Our group didn't have much experience off road, but Vuong did an excellent job of providing us with just the right amount of challenge during the ride. I learned some new skills and had a great time doing it! He also took a ton of pictures for us and with us from a lot of different angles and he had a blast doing it. He really fit in well with our group and had a great sense of humor!He took us to numerous places to eat and never failed to impress. The food was superb and he taught us a few tricks to spice things up a little! For one of the nights, we stayed at the home of a family where they made us an enormous spread of delicious food, and stayed around afterwards to converse and share their rice wine with us. We felt very welcome and I would say that was certainly one of the highlights of the trip for me.In the end, we all returned safe, happy, and spent! I am so glad that I chose this company for this tour. With most trips like this, I would say that it was a once in a lifetime experience... but I am already considering my next trip back to Vietnam to take a longer tour! Don't miss out on this adventure!"

I saw a few other tour companies while on tour and the quality of the bikes the were renting was very sub par compared to the practically brand new CRF250 I was riding. My only regret is not booking a longer tour...so now I just have to go back. Thanks for everything CHUNG & LEE!"

Met some good fellow bikers and truly friendly locals, visited many places, great twisty roads with some fun off-roading and river crossings, spectacular views all of which would not have been possible without the local knowledge of our very experience guide and mechanic Tan. Would recommend the tour to anyone who enjoys biking and a bit of an adventure."

Chung was always available to answer our questions before the tour, which helped with the preparation.We did the 3 day north vietnam tour (mai chau, phu yen, back to hanoi). The scenery was just lovely with a combination of smooth cruising on-roads and challenging off-road tracks depending on our preference. Lodging and meals was well chosen as well.The guide knew his way around the country and we also had a mechanic with us. The tour was definitely more fun with Vuong and Tu with their positive attitude and local know-how.We were all left touched by Vietnam's beauty and a ton of memories from the motorbike tour."

We did the 4 day hanoi tour but the 11 day hanoi to sapa is meant to be the king of the tours.I just got my bike license right before this tour so hadn't ridden much. Our tour guide modified the routes slightly to reduce the amount of offroad riding for us.Overnight stays in local villages is so much fun and be prepared to drink a bit of rice wine ;)Can't recommend this tour more :)"

Up close and personal and out of your comfort zone. This is not just an adventure but a cultural journey into the heart of Vietnam. In the hands of our experienced guide Vuong we were taken down many backroads only possible with local knowledge. Vuong was able to assess the groups riding abilities and customise the route accordingly. We never felt pushed to the to max. Our group consisted of beginners and experienced riders. Get used to riding at a slower pace. It all makes sense when you have to share the road with 20million other riders. Chung the owner is friendly in person, and made the booking process painless via the internet. We were fetched from our hotel and dropped off at the end. The bikes used are, either 125cc off-road or if you want a bit more power a 250cc off-road bike and they are all in good condition. We stayed in a combination of hotels and home stays. I preferred the homestays because they were run by local Vietnamese with which we could interact. I have had such a rich experience that I will be back for a longer trip. Just a note. If you are used to riding a large dualsport machine don't let the small bikes put you off this adventure, you will be missing out for sure. If there has been a little rain you will be grateful for the smaller bikes(lots of mud). If you can, plan for about 6-8 days. Do this trip you won't regret it! Thank you guys five\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f"

He was a ton of fun and really helped us improve our riding skills while making sure we had a terrific experience in this beautiful place. The bikes (125s and 250s) were in great shape and performed well no matter what the road conditions. We stayed at nice places throughout and the food was incredible. Our friends that we travelled with did most of the preliminary arrangements so they worked more with Chung than we did but when we did he was just as good as all the reviews say. We would work with these folks again in a heartbeat and highly recommend them to others interested in this type of adventure."

Vuong is a really skilled rider but his people skills are what made the trip so fun. He listened and went out of his way to make sure we had fun whether riding or hanging out in the evenings. He would go over the map in the mornings and would mention different routes and make recommendations based on our skills. Every day was great because it was just what we needed based on how energetic and competent we were feeling.One of the reasons we booked with this tour company was bc of the quick responses from Chung. All of our questions were answered quickly and thoroughly so we felt confident that we would have a well planned and safe ride. We were not disappointed."

After getting fitted with our own automatic scooters and gear, we set off through the busy city traffic towards the countryside. It was pretty scary initially as all of us were first time riders and only just learnt to ride the scooter that morning, however it was easy to pick up and even my dad who is in his late fifties had no trouble getting used to riding one.The day out in the countryside was refreshing and we rode through fields, visited a temple and small villages before stopping for lunch at an ancient village. Lunch was a spread and very delicious. On the way back, my sister unfortunately injured her leg. Our guide was prepared with a first aid kit and helped to wash the wound and bandaged it before we got back to the motorbike shop. Chung came with us to the local hospital and my sister got stitched up. We were very thankful for his company as language was a barrier and appreciate that Chung went the extra mile to assist us in getting medicine and paying at the cashier.Know that you will be in good hands when you choose to go on a tour with them! Thank you Chung and team!"

Three of us did an 11 day tour of North West Wietnam and down to Da Nang via the Ho Chi Min trail. We had 250cc Honda off road/on road motor bikes which were brand new when we started. For us ( being large kiwis) these were definitely much better than the usual 125cc bikes. Magnificent scenery, tracks, willages and people throughout the trip. Our guide, Quynh Nguyen Van, was the best. Incredibly cheerful, funny and always willing to accommodate our desire for as much off road adventures as we could get. If you use this company and get Quynh, he will happily look after whatever type of riding suits you from on road to as scary as you want it. We couldn't recommend this company more highly and are going back to tour North West Wietnam as soon as we can."

Everything was perfectly arranged from beautiful home stay in Mai chau, wonderful local dishes and amazing scenery, lots of photo opportunities and spontaneous moments that we will remember forever.

We experienced living with local families in traditional stilt houses and saw places we would never have been able to access on our own. In September 2015 we returned to Vietnam and took the North Eastern sector for 6 days thinking we had already seen the best this country had to offer but we were wrong.This place has so much to offer and boasts scenery that makes you believe you arrived on a set from \"Avatar\"Chung the director of Vietnam expert Motorbike Tour Expert company has developed a very professional tour company and planned the tours so there is a good balance of hotel and home stay experiences along the route. safety is a high priority and Chung personally met us at our hotel the morning of our departure to ensure all our safety equipment was suitable. Heavy duty plastic bags were supplied to ensure our gear was not immersed in dust and dirt along the trip. Lucky cause there's plenty of it!Qhiny, our tour guide was awesome-his experience and knowledge of the areas we travelled was extensive and our \"history lessons\" on Vietnam over a quiet drink after a long day were more than interesting.If you love riding motor bikes and up for an adventure with some get up and go then I highly to recommend this company.

Vuong not only knows fun back roads and interesting sights he is also an accomplished chef! The guide made sure the bikes ran smoothly on the road and that we were having fun. Perhaps he has done it so often but he was also very accurate in telling time for distances and arrivals. The roads were amazing and if you like a challenging backroad just ask for it. I have been riding for over 10 years and I have certainly never come across roads that were so interesting. The hotel stays were nice and clean and the homestays were also quite interesting, clean and friendly. The only bit of advice is to be honest with yourself and your level of riding skill, the traffic and roads will put it to the test. I recommend this trip for intermediate to advanced riders (other trips may be easier). It is a great experience and I highly recommend. Thanks Chung!"

It was both my partner and my first time ever riding motorbikes, and Chung was incredibly patient as he taught us how to ride despite our rocky start on our first day! We were given lots of protective gear, which was needed. I ended up riding an automatic, and my partner rode a manual XR125--I tried the manual, but it was incredibly top heavy for my size and experience. We spent 6-8 hrs riding each day (mostly because of my slow speed), and saw the most stunning scenery. We rode through as many back roads as possible, through gorgeous, FRIENDLY villages, where our guides arranged for generally excellent food for us. Both trips we stayed in home stays (houses on stilts). The second trip felt particularly special, as we stayed with our guide Hoan (who we loved!), with his 6-month old daughter, his wife, his mother, and his grandmother in their traditional Dao stilt home. We ate an absolutely incredible meal with a his entire family and a few other guests that night (though the local drinking tradition is intense!) for one of the highlights of our entire trip in Vietnam. The next morning, Hoan took my partner and I out on his family's boat into Thac Ba Lake, which was gorgeous and peaceful. The scenery to Mai Chau was more consistently impressive, but the terrain to Thac Ba was a little more challenging (with some off roading!), so was more fun for our second ride. Both trips included phenomenal coverage of small countryside villages and roads. We could not recommend Chung, his company, his staff or the bike trips more highly! If and when we are back in Vietnam, we will carve out time for a longer trip."

Did the 2 day trip and all food and drinks included, saw unbeleivale things, awsome tracks, and the tour guide made it very safe. Stayed and a homestay at Mau chau and was awsome to see the real Vietnam and people working on real rice fields, dinner and breakfast also included. I will recommends to all my friends and to anyone, Chung was very professional and the tour guide to the time to tell us about everything. I will definately be back to do the longer trip with all my friends. If you dont anything in vietnam, do this and you will be satisified. When I go back to Vietnam, I'll be going back for this ride. 100 percent do it."

We had one day left in Hanoi and were desperate to do a Motorcycle Tour (neither of us had motorcyle experience), looked at some reviews and are so glad we followed these recommendations! Ideally we were looking for something outside of the normal tourist routes and this was PERFECT! Contacted Chung via email and he responded almost immediately!Chung arranged the tour: taxi to shop, breakfast, coffee, practice time, motorcyles, helmets, gloves lunch, drinks, local \"snacks\" and an in depth knowledge of the history of each Pagoda/ Temple/ Town we visited along the way. Amazing experience to drive through rice fields and smaller towns and will definitely be recommending this trip to our friends. Chung ensured we were confident with our driving ability before taking us on to any major roads, reminding us that should we need to we could pull over at any time and he would wait until we were ready to carry on.Great knowledge of the history of the areas we were visiting and made the trip really unique. Local lunch and drinks gave us an even better experience of local life and culture. We'll definitely be heading back for a longer trip next time!THANKS CHUNG!"

They're located near Hanoi University, they speak and write excellent English, they have top-notch bikes imported from Thailand, they are VERY good with email queries, and they're willing to customize everything. Excellent people.I live in San Jose, USA, and initiated contact with 5 or so motorbike providers in the Hanoi area about a month and a half in advance of my trip. In general, 90% of what you are going to run into are resellers, 90% of whom are mostly illiterate in English. None of them can tell you much about your trip or your equipment except for vague platitudes.The \"Tour Experts\", though, are 100% responsive to email, usually within 12 hours. They know what they're talking about, and can tell you exact details about anything. Just email them; they are really good at responding promptly.When I was riding between rice paddies on an elevated dirt path 30 km outside Hanoi on a beautiful 250 Yamaha dirt bike, I was giggling like a little kid again. When we zipped past a herd of water buffalo outside a smoky brick factory I laughed out loud to myself.I traveled about 500km total with these guys and I trust them with my life. I have been to Vietnam multiple times and my time with them on my most recent trip was by far the most hilarious and fun. Good people, good equipment, and good service. 100% recommend."

Chung was so friendly and accommodating from start to finish. His prices are fair and reasonable for all this included in the price. All I had to pay extra for was drinks, which in Vietnam are cheap. The guide that Chung matched me with ( Hoan) was also exceptional. Hoan was patient, funny, flexible, and took care of the details. All I had to do was relax and enjoy the rides each day. One area as an example of Chung and Hoan being accommodating was with my diet. I am a vegetarian and this was no problem for Hoan to handle. All meals were delicious and provided me with more food than I needed. The combination of one night staying in a hotel and the next with a local family was brilliant. The host families were friendly and welcoming. This system gave a perfect balance for privacy one night and engaging local culture the next. The motorcycle that I was provided was nearly new with just 12,000 kms. We had absolutely no mechanical problems encountered on the way. Please do not hesitate to book your next motorcycle adventure with Mr. Chung. You cannot have but a terrific journey!!Lennard Jorgensen, Danmark"

He was very fast and efficient with email communications lead up to the holidays and also arrange a instant transfer through to the airport at an additional cost but not much. They stored our luggage whilst we where away.Our tour guide, Quinn was well spoken and had very good english skills. My experience on a motorbike was only 3 months (only obtaining my Provisional just recently in Syd, Australia).We were offered a choice of bikes and chose two Honda XR125 as we are tall and my Husband believed the extra suspension hight and higher seat position would be more suited to the journey. This proved a good decision as the terrain can shift quickly and the country roads are like swiss cheese. This is a fabulous way to see this amazing country and our trip included two home stays which we much preferred over the one hotel stay.fantastic all round but you need some riding experience as the traffic in Hanoi and the country requires a lot of concentration. I would also suggest for you to bring your own helmet for that piece of mind.the only suggestion I would recommend is that there is debrief to happen at the end of the day or at the start on where you would travel and for the home stay to reduce the amount of food served. We felt like we wasted a lot of food because we just could not eat the amount of delicious food they served up."

He made sure to keep an eye on us and rode to our skill level. When one of our group fell ill and couldn't continue on his own Voung sat him on the back of his motorcycle and continued the trip, even with the little bit of off-roading he was in complete control and our party member was completely safe. He was very easily able to suggest a shorter easier route that still took us through beautiful scenery when the full trip seemed too daunting for our ill friend.  While our trip was cut short it was still fun. It was well planned out and each stop came at the perfect time. Meals, hotels, and gas was paid for but you should still bring along money for when you stop at little shops and want refreshments. If possible I would definitely take a longer 7-8 day tour to take more in."

I highly recommend this motorbike tour company for anyone wanting to experience/see Vietnam and to do so in an unforgettable way!I went on a spontaneous trip to Vietnam and had less than 24 hours to plan out this motorbike tour. I emailed nearly 5-6 different companies but Motorbike Tour Expert was the company which replied the quickest and was extremely patient with all my queries. He answered all my questions promptly and was more than happy to entertain my requests down to the kinda things I wanted to see (countryside, paddy fields, temples, pagodas, villages) and also try some local food en route these sites and throwing in some off road fun as well! Like i said i traveled alone so price was a huge factor, i wanted my money's worth and it only cost USD 140 (ALL INCLUSIVE - meaning unlimited food/drinks throughout the entire 1 day journey) Other companies for a solo, private tour easily cost nearly USD 190...I advise you go in a group if possible to further push down prices.A special shout out to my new friend/tour guide, Mr Chung for such hospitality. He had good English and able to give some background knowledge of the sights he brought me to see so i was able to learn loads about the culture and the history of Vietnam! He was also nice enough to welcome me into his grandma's village house where we had nice Hanoi beer to take a break. Getting to step foot into a traditional Vietnamese house and having fermented pork and a cold drink was great! He also made sure that throughout the entire journey I was adequately hydrated, always ready to offer me water bottles, stopping by roadside shops to get coffee/sugar cane drinks! And, most importantly I felt incredibly safe...he always had me in his rear view mirror making sure i was keeping up. And especially as we weaved thru Hanoi traffic making our way out and back into the city...he always gave clear signals and checked on me!What was it like? Well, first he fetched me to his shop where i got fitted for helmet and gloves. A lot of choices for sizes and styles...and really can tell that they don't cut back when it came to safety wear. Also, there are several types of motorbikes to choose from - i went for the Honda XR125 which was incredibly comfortable for off road and kept in great condition! It's clear this is a company that was not just experienced in terms of the trails/sights but also one that took seriously the motorbikes' maintenance which was something I appreciated!The ONLY regret I had was that I didn't have a chance to go on a LONGER motorbike tour. I'm seriously considering coming back in the future to do a longer tour because of how much fun i had! Not to be missed!(RODE THROUGH HANOI COUNTRYSIDE ON 8th MAY 2015)"

My husband and I did the 2 day/1 night tour to Mai Chau. I am not an experienced rider so I went pillion behind Huon (pron: won) for the first hour (in busy city traffic) then went behind my husband for the rest of the trip and leisurely watched the countryside go by as I clicked away on my camera from the back of the bike. Day 1 was 6 hours riding, stopping every 90 mins to see a sight or a snack break. Day 2 was 8 hours, a longer way back to Hanoi through the hills. The homestay #6 in the Viet/Thai village was excellent in hospitality and the food we were served. FYI- Main meals are included in the tour price, towels are supplied at the homestay. We took a backpack each with a jacket, (sanitiser) aeroguard, camera, spare t Shirt, that's all you will need. Try the house made Rice Wine with dinner, it is potent- like Japanese Sake. When our hostess made us banana pancakes for breakfast and then gave me a Thai back massage before waving us off on the bikes- I knew we would have to return here on our next trip. On the bike rides we visited a chop stick factory- just because I was interested Huon arranged this for us. We stopped for crushed sugar cane juice, again because I was interested in the crushing machines you see in every town. My husbandliked the hammocks hung at one of our rest stops...so he and Huon tested them out for a snooze, with the locals! I cannot recommend this company enough, great value, personalised everything, Huon answered every one of my many questions about everything for the whole 2 days. I felt we had extra incite into the local customs and people because there were just 3 of us. The tour cost us $100USD per day and $30USD for the Homestay. message me if you have any questions.Querky note: the Homestay is a house on stilts ie: no downstairs walls, but free WIFi! WiFi is everywhere in Vietnam, bring your iPad."

He showed me so much local culture. I think we had a stretch of two days before I saw another tourist, and he took me to every \"local\" spot he could. Besides the amazing scenery in North Vietnam, one of the best parts of the trips were the \"home stays\", where you stay with local families (and if you're like me, drink a ton of rice wine with them). The last night of my trip, I stayed with Hoan's family, who are truly special people. I will never forget my visit with them. And good lord - if you like food, Hoan is the guy you want to travel with. He knows the best local food in the country. Someone should give him his own show on the Travel Channel. So, definitely book your trip with these guys. They really took care of me. And if you are given the option between a home stay and a hotel, pick the home stay every time.

During a recent 7 day work trip to Hanoi, I had one day spare without work commitments so I begun searching for someone who could take me out of the city on a motorbike tour. Let me start my saying I absolutly recommend this trip for someone with a short time, and ill explain how I can to end up having an unexpected swim in a rice paddy! I came across Chung from Vietnam Motorbike Tour Expert online via their website, and after reading some good review on trip advisor I got in contact to check availability and what sort of equipment was on offer. Chung responded within about 12 hours, saying he could take me on a 1 day tour, explained the suggested tour and gave me two options of bike to ride. As im a bit taller then most, I chose the Honda CRF 250 (other choice was a smaller XR125 bike). A note on the bikes - if you are not taller, and are doing just the day trip, you will be fine on the XR125. You will rarely get to a speed that requires the 250, its really for comfort if you are a taller rider. Chung arranged for one of his colleagues to meet me at my hotel. he arrived on a Bike as most people do in Hanoi, and waved down a taxi and instructed the taxi on how to get to their office and garage, about a 20-30 min cab ride (not far, but traffic is slow in Hanoi) Once I arrived, Chung paid for the Taxi (as agreed as part of the tour price) and showed me to the bike I was riding for the day. Some info on the Bike - The bike was an immaculate and perfectly washed clean. Chiung takes great care of the bikes, and has to import them from Thailand at great expense as he cant buy them in Vietnam. He does this purely because taller tourists request bigger bikes, and Chung really appreciates the quality gear. I will come to learn through out the day how rare these 250 dirt bikes are - as we travelled through villages out of town, kids pointed and ran out to the road to see the bike, while riding back in to the city in the afternoon, people on scooters would ride up next to me and take photos on their phones. I didnt see a single other bike of this size and type the whole trip. Anyhow, after arriving at the office / garage, Chung gave me a helmet, and riding gloves. I had a choice between full face or open face. Going back to jump on the bike, I asked CHung to let me have a 5 min test ride to get comfortable on the bike (never ridden a dirt bike before, only road bikes). Chung of coarse had no issue with this. We set off for about a 45min ride out of Hanoi, to a local Pagoda where Chung took me around and provided a great tour and knew a lot of detail about the Pagoda, and what each element represented. We stopped for tea and a snack, before heading off further out of town. Chung stated taking my through small dirt roads which begun to wind through rice paddies, each side of the track. Things started to get a little muddy on the tracks, and I had a blast on the big 250 bike having never done this sort of riding before. Getting confident, I found myself coming up behind Chung too quickly and snapped on the brakes on some slippery mud, and the front wheel went out under me. I found myself being launched off the bike, but fortunately, landing into a waist deep rice paddy canal. Chung was ahead of me, but had obviously heard my stack, and quickly stopped and ran over to help me prevent the bike from falling down after me. We both pulled the bike back uplright, and I climbed out of the Canal, by this time Chung was completely beside himself with laughter, and begun taking photos of me pouring water out of my shoes and scraping mud off my soaking jeans. Knowing how well Chung takes care of his bikes, I was very worried about his reaction of my stacking the bike, but he was totally fine and just wanted to be sure I was ok. As I was soaking wet, Chung offered to go past his father in laws house which was only a short ride away to clean up. I took him up on the offer, and as we arrived I was completly humbled by his families hospitality. Chungs 83 year old father in law welcomed me into his home, offered Tea, oranges and chocolate after I had cleaned up. I met the whole family, and by the end we had to leave they were inviting me to stay for the family wedding in a few weeks - wish I could have done! After getting photos together, I couldnt thank Chung and his family enough, before we headed off on the bikes again, before we stopped for the best meal I had while in Hanoi for lunch. We continued through rice paddys, small villages and towns on the way to 2 more temples which Chung again took me through and explained the significance of many elements. Heading back towards Hanoi, we stopped for coffee at a local cafe, before the slog back into the traffic of Hanoi. Chung was a fantastic tour guide, took me to some fantastic places with no other western tourists, took me into his family home, and had an absolute blast on the bike getting through some muddy dirt roads. Absolutely would recommend this trip, if you only have a short time in Hanoi and want to get out of town to see some of the real Hanoi life out of the city centre. Its a unique tour, you wont see many other tourists, if at all, at most of the locations. Great gear, great tour, great guide. Highly recommended, hope to return back sometime and do a longer tour with Chung. At the end of the day, I offered to pay for some of the damage I did to the bike (bent plastic fender) but Chung refused to take anything, and I felt very bad because of the great way Chung takes care of his bikes."

Johnnie was an excellent guide, fun and personable with good interpersonal skills and a command of English that will forever be better than my Vietnames, importantly he could assess riiding ability and design a tour to suit everyone.You have to bear in mind that the remoter areas simply cannot offer, currently, some of the luxuries that the tourist destinations offer but hey what are you there for...if not to experience them before they do have KFC's and burger kings.?When I go back I will ask for Johnnie to be the guide and I hope be within a larger group with the same riding aspirations.

This is one of those stop wondering and just do it tours that you won't have cause to regret and will carry memories of great moments and experiences away from.

From the minute I made the enquiry, the service has been excellent, Chung replies to emails with lots of information. Tan was our guide and his knowledge of the country is excellent, as is his English. Everything is organised for you and the whole trip was incredible. I would thoroughly recommend the home stay option too, it was just spectacular. The bike was brilliant according to my husband ( I was pillion) and Tan was very sensitive to the fact we are experienced bikers and wanted to see and do as much as possible."

Hello everyone,I was doing my Exchange Semester in Thailand (I am from Germany) and I was very interested in doing a motorbike tour in the North of Vietnam to see the beautiful scenere. The Problem was, that I have never driven a motorbike before. After I called Chung and we had a short conversation I decided to book a one day private tour to learn driving. To start learning driving in Hanoi might sound crazy for some People but I thought that might be a interesting experience :-)First Chung brought me to a place near his bike shop and explained how everything works. Than I could drive around and get some experience... expecially with using gears and so on. After I felt confortable with the bike (well, as confortable as you can after driving a motorbike for the first time) we started the tour. We drove around the see some villages. temples and ricefields. I was suprised how good he new the area. We have taken small nice roades and I could stop whenever I wanted. During the tour we had great Food and after the tour he invited me to have a beer togehter.As me budged was limited I couldnt do another tour for some more days. But if I had had the Money... I would have done it for sure!! Doing a tour with Chung is probably the best thing you can do in Vietnam :-)"

Great scenery, magnificent places to visit, marvellous food and two guides who miraculously seem to know every trail and road in Vietnam! Chung's service during the planning phase was outstanding and the service and commentary provided by our tour guides - Vung and Tommy was exceptional. No problem was too small for them and we loved meeting up and dining with Vung's extended family. The bikes were great and the provision of safety gear (elbow and knee pads) was welcome as was the focus on the safety of all members of our tour. We organised a truck to carry our belongings and I think this is a great idea. Thanks also to our driver Hung for his great support.We're already talking about another tour in northern Vietnam in a few years!Sincere thanks again Vung, Tommy, Chung and Hung for an experience we won't forget!"

Not only was it a blast to see the countryside on a motorbike (though riding through the downtown area was terrifying albeit a fascinating experience), but the guys took us to some incredible spots we never would have experienced without them. We drove on dirt roads, past women knee-deep in small streams hunting for snails and men walking their buffalo. We learned about the graves spotted through the farmlands. We had tea with Chung's grandfather in a typical Viet home. We ate a huge lunch in ancient Duong Lam village. We drank incredibly coffee on the side of the road. And when we moaned a little about having seen way too many pagodas and temples on our trip, Chung said, \"trust me on this one\" and took us to the most beautiful (quiet! tourist free!) pagoda we'd ever seen. Basically, it was everything you would want from a tour - off the beaten path, led by locals and filled with stunning scenery and good food.Don't just trust me. Read the rest of the reviews here.

What a brilliant tour! 1000kms over 6 days with a group of 7 from Australia, led by Luke and supported by Sy and Hero. The bikes were great, the riding and scenery were fantastic. We had three home stays during the tour and two hotel stays. We encountered a variety of weather across our trip, and the scenery really was breathtaking. The roads were good, particularly the hills winding up to and out of Sapa.But by far the best part was sitting around at dinner reviewing the day, learning about Vietnam and its beautiful people and chequered history, and sharing meals and rice wine with our home stay hosts. We had some very big nights (\"one more, one more\") as well as some quiet time when we needed it.Luke, Sy and Hero were brilliant hosts. They coped with all our different requests and adjusted the tour as we went along to accommodate extras, such as a trip to the China-Vietnam border. They joined in everything we did, as well as taking care of the bikes and all the safety elements for such a trip.Chung was our main contact during the organisation of the tour. We changed the length of the trip several time as well as the itinerary; we emailed back and forth often as we asked questions and refined the arrangements. Chung responded so quickly every time and was incredibly patient and helpful.Do your homework regarding what you need to bring with you for such a tour. The guys will help but you need to give your comfort some thought. 6 days in the seat can bring out the aches and pains and you need to allow for any sort of weather.We feel we have made lifelong friends with these guys. We are already planning a return trip.Carolyn and Trevor PillansHobart Australia"

Setting up the tour was a breeze, as Chung promptly answered all twenty something emails I sent him. Minutes before we set off, we decided to change up the tour, taking one day off, and the boys at Vietnam Motorbike Tour Expert were very accommodating. Our guide Cuong jokingly (or so we thought...) told us that he is known as the King of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. This is no lie, as every time he recommended a particular road (as opposed to a road we had planned) we were led through jaw dropping scenery, and amazingly fun, twisty mountain roads! Listen to his suggestions!If you love being on two wheels, this may well be the ride of your life. If you're not experienced at all, the boys will slow the pace and take you through quieter roads, and even give you some quick lessons. Don't let a lack of experience push you away, but of course do be careful out there. I absolutely recommend this trip if you want to see the real, stunningly beautiful Vietnam, or if you're up for a great adventure, or if you're looking for some of the best motorbiking roads in the world, and don't want to worry about a single thing!"

It was my first motorbike trek, and I have found a new favorite way to travel! Amazing scenery, fun roads, and friendly homestays made this trip an experience that I will remember fondly for years to come.As for Motorbike Tour Experts, they were consistently great. We booked everything before we arrived in Vietnam, and Chung was incredibly helpful with the planning. Before the trip, each of us had a bit of experience riding scooters but none riding manual gearshift motorbikes. Chung included motorbike lessons in the package and was willing to let us all try our hand on new Honda motorbikes. When it became clear that two of the three of us weren't confident enough on the bikes to handle Hanoi traffic, Chung was able to provide two automatic scooters for us, and we felt much more comfortable driving these. The tour also included airport pick up and drop off, which was a pleasant perk.As for the tour itself, our guide Tan has 6 years of experience as a guide, and his experience definitely showed. He kept us entertained and feeling safe throughout the tour, matching the pace of our travel to our confidence on the bikes. Regular stops for photos and cool drinks to stymie the hot weather definitely made the ride more enjoyable. Overall, I would highly recommend touring with Motorbike Tour Expert. We saw beautiful parts of Vietnam that we would never have been able to find on our own. Definitely a trip to be remembered."

I recommend them whole heartedley and I can be contacted at garethclear@gmail.com as an external validation. A couple of thought points for anyone considering the 8/9 day tour: I would insist on staying in sa pa for more than just an afternoon. It's beatiful and one of the highlights. This gives more time to get out on foot and hike/explore. Some of the 'hotels' you stay in after 200km ride are a bit generic and dull. Where possible adjust the intinary to avoid these and stay in homesteads The conclusion of the ride at lake be po (sp!!!) is great. but again there is is no time to explore and enjoy the peace and tranquility, or take a boat ride. I would build in time for this but most importantly just enjoy the riding and the views. Just an exceptional experience"

I love motorcycling and I love getting up close and personal to new and exotic places - this will definitely go down as one of my most memorable adventures and proved a great bonding experience for me and my son.We did a 3-day Northern Vietnam tour out of Hanoi from Feb 12 - Feb 14. The tour group was really professional, our guide was easy going and great to work with, the countryside was awesome, and the people we met along the way were so friendly and welcoming. The only downer was the weather, but given it was mid-Winter and we were travelling through the mountains, I can hardly hold that against anyone. In fact, the challenge of beating the weather deepened the richness of the experience, and it wasn't something that a couple of extra layers of clothes and a 1m length of plastic wrapped around each leg couldn't fix.If I could visit Vietnam again in the warmer months, I'd definitely want to go for one of the longer rides; and I'd be bringing a few more mates along too. This is an experience that has to be shared.If you're an outdoors sort of person and like going beyond the typical tourist hotspots, this is definitely for you."

Our guide Tan spoke excellent english and led us out of Ha Noi into the countryside and over some excellent byroads through magnificent countryside in the hills and plains and along the lake. We overnighted at a home-stay village which was an excellent experience, and a hotel. As vegetarians we had excellent local food throughout the trip. Our goal for the trip was to experience and see the life of the Vietnamese culture away from the bustle of the city. Tan was very easygoing and a veritable wealth of information on culture, history and language. The riding was not challenging, anyone comfortable on a bike would be fine. Of bike gear we brought along our own jackets and gloves. Being January it was cool and misty in the mornings with warm days and we had no rain. Our route being mostly back-roads was away from heavy traffic which made it easy to relax and enjoy ourselves. I would love to do one of the company\u00b4s longer tours into the border regions with Laos and China, however we had short time, and this tour was a highlight of our time in Vietnam."

The tour was well organized, in time and overall very exiting. They are taking care on security (equipment was provided), the new Honda XR125 are perfect for such a trip. What I really like is to be flexible in all cases. So he was following my wishes, had stops for fotos, using dirt tracks, did a boat trip and get the full vietnamese experience. I was impressed about local introduction, he was aware about the important details for the region. I was several times in Vietnam, but doing a well guided tour on a motorbike is the best way to discover the country and get in touch with the locals. I'm sure you will find tour agents with lower prices, but the money you spend with Motorbike Tour Experts is well invested. You dont have to take care on additional expenses, nearly everything is included. For this year I intend to do an additional tour with a few friends to Sapa, and of course again with Motorbike Tour Experts. Rico"

Best thing was that our tour guide improvised the tour depending on what he felt we were enjoying most, and Chung Can was extremely efficient and organised with the planning.This is so much more than a tourist packed routine tour, helped with this region being practically untouched. I really hope that the area we visited stays this way as there are few beautiful areas left so natural."

First of all, Minh is great for two very simple reasons : he made us discover Vietnam in its most spontaneous awesome aspect and secondly he thought me to ride a bike without causing death along the way. My friend and I (two girls) we were looking for non touristic things to do, we went to different guides but it was always very \"set up\", then we met Freebird Adventures, we took bikes and rode with Minh through those beautiful landscapes, rice fields, waterfalls, hills, villages, houses, basically in all those places you would normally miss in those way-too-organized-tours. The whole trip was spontaneous, personalized, we got to decide what we wanted to do and at what pace to make the most of it. Once the tour was over, we even decided to buy a bike from Minh, he gave us all those tips and advices we'asked for so we can keep traveling on a bike by ourselves, because to be honest there is no better way to visit Vietnam than riding a bike through the country, starting with Minh."

The museums and old quarter are great, but I didn't feel like I got to catch a glimpse into local life until I went on the moto tour. Minh was a great guide, helping me with my moto, explaining different aspects of the culture, answering my questions and showing me a side to the Hanoi countryside that I would've never seen on my own. There were many special moments that I will remember for the rest of my life. If you can do only one thing in Hanoi, I recommend you do this!"

We arrived at Hanoi airport to be greeted by Minh who immediately made us all feel very welcome and at ease. After a short amount of acclimatising in the old quarter we jumped on the overnight train to Lao Cai where our bikes awaited us. Over the next 5 days I experienced the most memorable and at times exhilarating moments of my life culminating in an adrenaline rush, navigating the traffic of Hanoi back to Minhs place. The most beautiful scenery, isolated villages and countryside were a true reflection of Vietnam. We had comfortable homestay accommodation and a wide range of food experieces; at times not for the faint hearted. The whole trip was a true sensory smorgasbord perfect for the adventurous soul. Minh is a confident relaxed guide who is dedicated to maximising his guests experiences. His relaxed and confident manner, experience and flexibility when required makes you feel safe. I had an awesome time. I would thoroughly recommend Minh to anyone wanting to do such a trip."

Minh met us at the airport took us to dinner and made sure we were ok and also took us to lunch before the trip. We rode some 2800 kilometres over the 2 journeys and it was a great experience seeing the countryside and the people. Minh is a great guide and a real character always urging us on, whether it was riding the bikes or eating as he loves his food. You can't put into words what we experienced you just have to go and do it. One of the best motorcycle trips I have done so far. The bikes were well maintained and all you needed for the terrain, food was excellent and a great guide who always went out of his way to ensure you were having a good time and gave you an insight into the people & places we visited. This was my 3rd trip to Vietnam and it is an amazing country with friendly people that I wanted to see more of on a motorcycle which is the best way to see it up close.

So arranged a meeting with Minh to discuss required trip. As soon as we met you could see the passion he has for his business. Nothing was too much trouble and we soon had it all sorted. As my nephew was with me and had not riden much Minh arranged for some lesson time for him in a secluded spot to get used to the bike (always thinking of your safety and comfort) once he was confident we arranged time to leave for our journey from Hanoi up to Sapa. Well the next 7 days were amazing the country gets better and better the further you go and all the time Minh is making sure all is well and you are happy. This man knows every inch of Vietnam it seems. Everything is planned for you so you just need to take it all in and enjoy.

Never at any time did we feel we were not being looked after 110% at the top of this amazing journey we had a day and night in Sapa then caught the night train back to Hanoi. What an awesome trip.

As it always happens, I had to choose from a few motorbike travel companies but I picked Freebird Adventures because I felt like this tour company was not too big, and therefore there was a higher chance of me getting more attention as a customer. And I was right. During my short term contract in Hanoi, I really wanted to get away from the city and enjoy the fresh air, and see non-touristy places. I just wanted to explore\u2026so I called Minh. We met up and discussed the possible options. He gave me some ideas for the itinerary so I went on my first 3D2N tour with one of his Yamaha Taurus bikes (semi-automatic). And those three days left me speechless. The waterfalls, the people, the roads, the rice fields, the food, the stories\u2026it was so authentic I had no idea it all existed. It was a good ratio between distance and time to actually discover outside of Hanoi. Not too long after my first trip, I called Minh again to see if we could do another tour, this time longer and with a bigger bike. I was ready for a crazy adventure. Together with two other English guys we have conquered close to 1000km on our Hondas XR150 around Northern Vietnam. 6D6N Fantasy North Tour was\u2026a real fantasy. I saw roads that I never thought were real, I tried delicious food that I will probably won\u2019t be able to prepare myself and I have met sweet minority women in colorful ethnic clothing as if they just came off the pages of National Geographic. Vietnam was all in front of my eyes, I could experience the raw beauty of the North from the seat of my motorbike. Seeing the simple life of Vietnamese people was truly life changing experience. These experiences would not be the same without a friendly tour guide, who knows every single corner of every single mountain. Minh truly is a Tarzan. His job is literally to make you happy. During his custom tours, he will make sure that you are happy and relaxed, and at the same time challenged and empowered! Hw will tell you stories and jokes, so don't be surprised if you end up being good friends in the end of the tour:) If you chose to go with Minh, you better keep going and never give up! It is worth it, because it is excellent."

Minh and his brother's personalities were great and they made the trip a memorable experience that we highly recommend to anyone with a background in motorbikes/mopeds."

Riding with Minh I've experienced:- The harrowing flow of the Hanoi's traffic- A race through the countryside.- A temple in the hills only accessible by a leaky boat.I wouldnt want to spoil the rest of the trip that Minh has throughly throught out but considering I only did a one day tour it was only a tidbit that leaves myself wanting to stay in Vietnam that much longer to see what Minh has it stores on his longer adventure. I would definitely book with Freebirds again if I'm ever in need of an adventure."

He cares deeply about Vietnam and the culture and will take you to real homestays deep in the countryside. He was fun, friendly, safe, accommodating. Again, we could recommend him more. If you haven't ridden for a while or don't currently ride, do consider how full on driving in and out of Hanoi is. But it's so worth braving the city streets to benefit from the countryside beyond.

As soon as i met Minh i felt comfortable, under no pressure to buy a particular tour, his friendly & positive nature is refreshing. He listened to my ideas, what i was passionate about, what i wanted to see, what i wanted to do & custom built an epic experience for just me.Free as a bird that\u2019s exactly how i felt, passing through the incredibly vast and variously rich landscape infused with locals & their daily way of life. We went to a beautiful village where the residents built all their houses on stilts from the trees they had cut down, stopping to meet families & play with children, riding over Indiana Jones style bridges, challenging mud slopes, & fast dust tracks, over clean, blue & green rivers swarmed in greenery, rich with the sounds of wildlife. Passing stunning vast plantations of sugar cane overlooked by jagged rock formations, 360 degree views standing on top of the dynasty gate, (awesome!), barefoot climbing up the middle of a naturally widely stepped waterfall, swimming in rivers, praying in temples, trekking up hills & around nature parks, visiting markets, meeting welcoming families & bunkering down in home stays, on & on i could go. Wow! I honestly cant believe i did this much, it's just thrilling what you can experience in 4 days. Minh's mechanical know how, respect for others & knowledge of the rugged wilderness means you can go pretty much anywhere & do pretty much anything. Highly recommended, book with confidence, miss the crowds & get the personal touch. Thanks for giving me one of my most memorable journeys through Narm. See you again smt soon my friend, northern loop or Hcm trail next time!!Ride out & Rock on!!"

His judgement about suitable terrain for his riders is spot on. He has mad skills on his bike ! Trust his judgement, he knows what he's doing.I should have left my GoPro running the entire time as every leg of the journey was memorable and beautiful. The waterfalls, rice paddies, rivers, emerald green hills, water buffalo, birds, the people ...were amazing. Don't be lame and forget your charger like I did.The home stays were really good.

He came to our hotel that morning to sit and speak with us , asking about what we'd like to see and offering suggestions.A couple of days later on the day we arranged, we set off and were guided by Minh through the chaotic Hanoi rush hour traffic but he had us onto the back roads in only a short time. We had an amazing ride through villages, past rice paddies and fields of lotus blossoms, lakes, a pagoda, up to a mountain view of Hanoi and much more. Along the way we stopped regularly for refreshments and photo opportunities.My only cautions about the day are:-Put sunscreen on regularly, as the hot sun and wind can burn you quickly, and/or wear a long sleeve shirt-If you plan ahead bring your own mx gloves, and even your own helmet if possible-If you aren't used to riding a lot you may find it a tiring day. Stop regularly and drink plenty of water-Get Minh to organize a good cushion or padding for your pillion, especially if they aren't used to riding either.Regardless of the above, we had a great day and saw sights most tourists would not get to see, when we come back to Vietnam again we'll definitely be organising another trip with Minh. He is very friendly, professional, and accommodating and made sure we had a great day!"

I just explained to him briefly about what I wanted to go see and he know best where and how to get there. It was a very warm and long day riding on a motorbike, but it was a worthwhile to see not only local livelihoods, e.g. rice paddies, livestock, fishing, weaving and stunning sceneries but understand how Hanoi sub-urban areas have been changing in the last decade--this is my personal interest and there is no way I can get this from books or movies. I was very impressed by his English, biking and multi-cultural skills got from long years of running various kinds of tour. Most important, local people were nice and allow me to take photos of them just because they know Minh or feel comfortable with his friendliness. Above all, rather than just a one-day guide, he is a good reliable friend. Thank you, Minh :)"

There are a lot of motorbike tour companies operating out of Hanoi, and before our trip I did a lot of research to try and work out who would give us the best experience. I have to say I am so pleased we found Freebird Adventures. Everything about the experience, from the initial emails with Minh was extremely friendly and professional. I took an instant liking to Minh because of his obvious desire to show people on his tours the 'real Vietnam'. So many operators claim this - but Minh really means it. We were a group of four people including my wife who was to ride pillion on my bike. Initially Minh was concerned about my wife because his nature is to try and make sure all his guests are happy, however I assured him she would be fine. Being the thoughtful guy he is, Minh actually had a seat welded up with cushions that attached to the back of my bike to make sure my wife was comfortable! Amazing service and dedication to customer's needs. The bikes Minh arranged were brand new CRF250L dirt bikes, perfect for what we were after. The trip itself was unforgettable - stunning scenery and the opportunity with Minh to really get off the tourist trail, meet the locals, try the regional food and have an amazing adventure. The best parts for me were the challenging off road sections and going through the local villages where you can really see everyday life in North Vietnam, staying in the homestay at Bebe lake and getting the bikes across Bebe lake on the boats! We literally saw only a handful of tourists the whole time we were on the road, so we certainly felt off the beaten track. Another thing that was also really good about Minh's tour is the fact we rode up towards Sapa over the six days but then got the overnight sleeper train back meaning we had more time riding towards the North and didn't have to do the ride back to Hanoi. If you go on this trip, ask Minh if you can stay at the homestay outside of Sapa, beautiful place run by a really nice Aussie guy and wife. Million dollar view as Minh would say. Finally, a word about Minh. Minh is an incredibly kind hearted and honest man who will not stop until everyone on his trip is happy. We had a couple of dramas on our trip: my brother and I got sick (because we ate something Minh advised us not to - our fault) and he handled the situation as you would expect from a top notch professional tour operator. He helped us get medicine and find a place to rest (my brother was incapacitated for about six hours) and he adjusted our itinerary at the drop of the hat. We also had a problem with one of the bikes and Minh simply pulled into the next town and had it sorted in no-time. Minh is also a very funny guy and kept us highly entertained with his views on many different topics and stories about Vietnam. To sum up: Dont think too much, be a man, do the right thing and go on a trip with Minh - you will not regret it!"

We got to sample many local dishes at road side cafes that it would be hard to access if we were travelling solo.  I would highly recommend the trip from Hanoi up to Sapa.

It was rainy and cold most of the time (close to freezing temperature on the summits), but without question the best trip I have ever made. While Minh took us on winding backroads, we met intresting people, ate great food and learned alot about Vietnamese culture. Oh, and the driving was AWESOME! Do not miss out on an experience like this!/Oscar from Sweden"

It rained nearly the whole time, and we both had a small crash each, but Minh has a great personality and is a pleasure to spend time with that the rain didn't even matter and just added to the adventure. We ate all sorts of local foods, went to hidden waterfalls and villages that you would never have known about by yourself, and had the best trip.Crazy Minh is the man, I can't recommend him enough. Definitely go with this guy. Love ya MinhMardy & Katie"

My son,friends and i have been lucky enough to have made three great motorcycle trips with Minh,. everyone of them has been an adventure of their own. The sights ,sounds and smells of Viet Nam cannot be experienced from the inside of a bus or the dreaded mini van but by best of all on the open road, on a motorcycle with the smells of rural Viet Nam wafting around you. The many roadside stalls that we have stopped at are an adventure on their own as the people want to know more about us than we can ask of them Minh is very handy with the many dielects of the Vietnam language great for when you are in the hills or indeed over most of Viet Nam.The scenery everywhere you go is spectacular but as always the good places are the hardest to get to but well worth it, the dirt roads ,floating bridges and the suspension bridges Minh knows where they are.I have found MInh to be a very honest person who takes great pride in looking after his clients and their wellbeing that they become great mates which says it all. I would not hesitate to recommend Minh and Freebird Adventures to anyone its the best way to travel as we say, go hard, enjoy the ride and never give up you wont regret it cheers Minh i will be back again"

Minh guided my father and sister and I through some of the most beautiful country I have ever seen. The riding was long and challenging, but totally worth it. Gorgeous mountains, valleys, waterfalls, villages, markets, delicious food, it was a trip of a lifetime. Minh knew every road like the back hand and was able to reroute us and change our accommodations at a moment's notice when we had to alter our planned trip midway through. He made sure to get us good deals on hotels and food. To anyone who wants to get out of the tourist traps and off the beaten track I highly recommend giving Freebird Adventure a call. I'd recommend having at least intermediate riding skills, but even though my sister was a beginner, Minh coached her through the whole way and by the end of the trip she was riding like a pro. Make sure to eat some water buffalo. And try to go through Meo Vac on a Sunday so that you can go to the big market. Go on this trip ASAP, you won't regret it. Motorbike is really the best way to see this part of the country."

Over the course of about 2.5 months, I traveled through a few countries in SE Asia, and my experience on my Freebird trip is easily at the top of the list. I will forever remember this experience for the rest of my life. MInh will take care of everything from start to finish. He met us at the airport upon arrival, and helped us settle in the first day in Hanoi. Then my friend Jackie and I set off one what was to be an amazing adventure. We did a 7 day trip from Hanoi up into the then mountains and valleys of Northern Vietnam on the 100cc bikes. Each hour, of each day, became more beautiful and jaw dropping. I would think to myself, \"How can this get more beautiful?\" then within the next hour we would drive into another magical landscape. The people and families we met and stayed with were just as amazing. I loved staying with friends of MInh in their homes, having family meals, and fully embracing a culture that was new to me. Food! I love Vietnamese food, and Minh will show you some fun stuff I am certain you have not tried before. As far as the technical aspect of riding the moto bikes - its AWESOME. Get ready to push your limits and be on your toes, or in the mud! Minh will not take you out of ability level, but I assure you will he will quickly help you become a more skilled riding each day. I plan to return to Vietnam with some of my boys, and do it again on dirt bikes. in the words of minh \"Don't think about it, just go\"Again, thank you MInh."

It would be hard to describe all of my adventures with Minh, but in a few words: lakes, mountains, rice wine, national parks, drinking rice wine in national parks until one blacks out, waterfalls, jumping off waterfalls, sleeping beside waterfalls while too hungover from rice wine to climb said waterfalls, and he even took us to the village where he grew up so we could visit his mom.

She is full of knowledge of the city and the food and restaurants she took us to.Highly recommended. Ask for Vivienne."

She is incredibly funny and shared with us some very interesting history and attempted to teach us some common phrases. Donut managed to navigate our small group through the crazy traffic in the Old Quarter and shared some of the amazing food that is on offer. It was interesting, entertaining and certainly a hihtlight of our time in Hanoi. Thank you Donut for showing us this side of Hanoi"

Had 9 different foods. All very delicious! My favourites were the egg coffee, donuts, sticky rice ice cream, bhan mi. My husband loved the dried beef salad and Bun Cha. Donut was very funny & sociable. Great English & engaged us all in conversation. She also gave us great history lessons. At the end of our tour, Donut wrote down all the foods we had tried. Did the 11am tour and finished just after 2pm. Walking was not too strenuous - now experts at crossing the road.Def recommend. Thanks, Donut!!"

Each stop featured a delicious dish, accompanied by a helpful explanation of ingredients and/or significance to Vietnamese culture. Some of the stops were fairly mainstream - like a more prominent bun cha restaurant. Others were hidden gems, found at the end of narrow hallways or above seemingly residential entrances. In other words, we went to places we would not have easily found on our own. One highlight was trying our hand at making thin rice crepes under the stoic instruction of the shop owner. She finally cracked a smile when one of the guys succeeded in lifting a crepe whole after watching his first attempt disintegrate. The final product - rice crepe, egg, and minced pork - was delicious. If you can, ask for Donut as your guide - she was enthusiastic, knowledgable, and a ton of fun. The final stop for a banh mi sandwich may have been one too many, but by the end of the tour, our group was happy and very full."

At the first stop, the Koreans put a lot of these really hot red peppers in their soup. The Swiss guys put less and they were really HOT!!! The Koreans did not eat the red peppers. They just used them to flavor the broth. The Swiss guys didn't know that and ate the peppers. I only put one little piece in to flavor my broth at another place and it was almost too hot to eat."

The food was so delicious and for the rest of our trip we had 10-15 different places we could comfortable dine in - breakfast lunch or dinner. There was a huge variety that catered to any dietary needs. It was well worth the few dollars we paid and we were SO full by the last few stops (make sure to wear your stretchy clothes). This tour has now made me search food tours in every place we visit. I'd do this tour a hundred times over. The groups were a comfortable size and we all got along great. This also gave us an awesome tour of the city as you walk from place to place. The walk was short and easy (it help the full tummy - trust me, you will welcome movement half way through).

I booked a street food tour on my first day in Viet Nam, before the rest of my group arrived as I thought it would be a great way of eating great food without having to dine out alone but also a fun way to meet new people and discover the area. I am so glad I saw the recommendation to book a tour with Kim Tours as it was just near my hotel and they had a tour departing within an hour or so. I did the evening street food tour. It was a bit disorganised to begin with as there were too many people so we needed 2 guides and one group departed a bit later. As I was in that group, I missed out on going to the water puppet theatre, but luckily this did not matter as I was able to go another day. We went to several places, mainly throughout the Old Quarter. It was the Saturday of a public holuday so the place was buzzing, the night market was on and the streets were largely closed to cars which was helpful. We also went to a few places around the top of the Hoan Kiem lake. We tried a great range of food, mainly traditional Ha Noi specialities but the guide adapted it for our group - for example, one man asked if we could have Beer Hoi so she arranged it. Some places were small and we would never have visited them or even found them on our own. We had a go at making rice pancakes, we sat on teeny tiny stools and we learned about the traditions and history of Viet Nam and Ha Noi as well as eating great food! I can highly recommend this must-do tour - to the extent that I probably bored the rest of my holiday group when they arrived by mentioning it frequently!"

We had over 10 dishes in almost as many places in a tour that lasted around 3 hours (but felt shorter). It was also a good introduction to the old part of Hanoi. Miss Moon explained the philosophy behind why certain ingredients were used in the food, which certainly added to the experience.

We were recommended to get a guide called Miss Moon, but Lotus was brilliant!For about $60AUD we visited 7 local street traders and restaurants, starting at Lotus's favorite Bun Cha ta (grilled pork noodle soup). From there we walked and ate our way through many different dishes and with help from Lotus I felt like a (stuffed) Hanoian by the end! Some of my favorites were the Banh Cuon (rolled rice flour pan cake with pork, mushroom, onion and fried shallot), as well as some of the sweeter dishes such as the Bo Bia (rice flour crepe roll with shredded coconut and fried sugar shards) and the Vietnamese doughnut. Lotus helped to describe each dish and how to enjoy them with the sides and seasonings. Tips - definitely go in the morning so that you have fasted over night (don't eat breakfast) and so that you can use the rest of the day to digest all the food! I went on a solo tour but you can do group tours with up to 10 people too. Book through Kim Tours and ask for Lotus. 74 Hang Bac Street, Hanoi. 0996 960 188 / +84 966 960 188 (Int'l)."

We were also able to complete the tour in just over 2hrs rather than the advertised 3hrs which was ideal in the heat.We did this on the recommendation of many of our friends and we'll be recommending it as the No. 1 activity too!

A friend and I had already done a food tour in Ho Chi Minh City, and we were told that the flavours vary between the North and South, so we had to do another food tour on the back of a scooter. Scooters are such a big part in Vietnam, it felt a shame to miss out on the chaos.Our tour guide was Nga and 3 other well trained scooter riders. They immediately put us to ease. They were all very chatty and friendly, and knew a lot about the local history. As you would expect, they also knew a great deal about the local cuisine and where to find it.We hit up 14 or so stops each with different types of food or drink. The food was delicious, and the flavours differed from the South. We ate a lot, I wish i hadn't eaten on the day before the tour. They'll happily recommend more restaurants at the end of the tour, and if you're still hungry, let them know and they'll take you around to other restaurants -- I very much doubt you'll still have enough room for food after the half way point :)This is a must, and definitely do this on your first day so that you've got time to eat again or try the recommendations later on in your trip."

A few people in the group had some reservations about the safety of taking a tour on scooters but the lovely Vietnamese ladies who took the small group of 7 of us around were experienced, safe and stable drivers and within minutes everyone felt calm and safe. It was a fantastic experience to do the tour on mopeds as it not only gave an authentic experience of hanoi but it meant we could reach some farther out places that you would not have got to with a walking tour. We tried around 7 food dishes, hanoi beer, egg coffee and rice wine. I would recommend Nga as a guide if possible as she was an incredibly funny and intelligent young lady who not only ensured we had so much fun throughout but also gave an insight into history and politics in Vietnam which was very interesting.I'd recommend this tour to everyone - young, old, couples, friends and solo travelers. It was our highlight in hanoi - thank you to the wonderful team!"

The organization and splitting of groups was not impressive. Overall, food was quite poor. We have been all over Vietnam and tried other food tours, so maybe that's why we knew it wasn't great.. Everyone in our group was so confused when, after dessert, we went to have banh mi (viet sandwiches). The order was totally off. Nor would locals eat like that.Our guide was really kind though and all smiles, but honestly she sounded really scripted...Did not feel genuinely engaged, but i felt bad for her.Overall the disappointment was the quality of food and organization of groups. If it is your first stop in Vietnam though go for it, maybe you will enjoy it."

We sampled a wide variety of local specialties and Teddy explained everything in detail, while also giving the group a chance to chat and relax. Very good value for less than $55 AUD for both of us we had 8 things to eat (6 main dishes), two desserts and drinks (beer and coffee) all inclusive. Teddy was kind enough to write down the restaurants we visited so we could go back. Bun Cha, crab soup and sweet coconut rice paper roll were the highlights. Would highly recommend the tour for any traveller and guide, Teddy."

I'm very adventurous and my wife is somewhat adventurous and we were bought a bit concerned if we would have stomach problems. We didn't. However, honestly, almost all of the 7 restaurants we visited were really dirty and the apparent food handling practices were of concern. We've traveled to many countries and recently completed a food tour in Ho Chi Minh City, so it wasn't as if we've never been in a similar situation. We expected a better selection of restaurants, given the thousands of choices. Beyond the appearances, candidly, the taste of the food was good, but not great. In it's favor, the tour was very inexpensive and overall it was a good experience in terms of learning."

We were happy to chat and meet new people, however, I would say that if you are not interested in meeting or talking to other travelers then it could be slightly awkward at meals as some of the tables are very small and intimate. I wouldn't say I have the most adventurous palette and I still thoroughly enjoyed nearly every dish. We even returned to one of the restaurants after the tour as we loved the food so much!

Often its very touristic and not a \"real\" experience because they take you to places were they can make more money. Or the tour guide asks everyone the same questions and you think \"hey he/she just has to ask that and has no real interest in you.\" This agency is the no.1 on TripAdvisor so we were a bit suspicious if it will be another \"mass processing\" experience.The tour:Our tour started at 5pm and there were 10 people waiting in front of the office. They split us in a 6 and in a 4 people group. Me and my partner were in the group of 4 and our guide was Alisia. She was great. From the first moment it didn't feel like a typical tour. It was more like a friend is showing you around in Hanoi. We tried the egg coffee, some soups, salads, spring rolls, beer and so many other things. Everything was very good and yes we ate real street food. It was not extra cooked for the tour and at the most places there were no tourists. There was enough to eat. The other couple couldn't eat up everything. Conclusion:We are really happy that we booked this tour. Great food, fantastic guide, good value. Why couldn't be every tour like this?"

The 'Half-day Hanoi Old Quarter Food Tasting Tour' was the least expensive tour that I have ever taken. To be honest, this gave me a little concern but this turned out to be the very best tour for Value. Our guide, Xui, was a very knowledgeable and likable young man who gave us great insight and information into everything from the food to the neighborhood. We had skipped lunch and I did not expect that 'food tasting' would amount to dinner but, was I wrong about that! We stopped at six places. The first was a restaurant where we had grilled fish and Bun Cha. It was plenty to eat for the six of us. At each of the following street food stops I expected to eat less, as I was getting full but, the entrees were so good and so different that I kept eating! Our fifth stop was for coconut ice cream and sticky rice - doesn't sound very appealing, right? It was absolutely extraordinary! The sticky rice is steamed in banana leaves and it is bright green. The coconut ice cream with shavings and whipped cream made this dessert a big hit! Our last stop was for egg coffee. Unbelievable yet again...very heavy and thick but, it was like egg nog coffee, two things that I love! The food was worth far more than what we paid for the tour. The tour lasted about three hours which was just perfect. Definitely do the evening tour!!"

We went for the 5pm tour, I might have taken the more later ones as this amount of food was a lot and all I wanted in the end was to sleep.We stopped at 9 places, all very tasty and authentic. Our guide Alisia was brilliant, with excellent English. she shared a lot of her personal experience with us.All in all great value."

            "review": "Great food at venues we would have otherwise passed on. . 4 stars as it wasn't absolutely spectacular but was good fun all the same. Our guide Lizzie was really nice but as she was fairly new to the job. It can be forgiven that she wasn't probably quite as outspoken as another guide may have been. She did know exactly where she was going though and her English level is good. You do get to go to pretty authentic venues with the tour and the food is really good but I think if your worried about hygiene then you may want to reconsider. It was strange as at some of the street food places, they were empty bar the tour groups from Hanoi Street Food Tours but having said that, the food is still good. You do short walks around the old quarter to each venue. It's a tight squeeze at pretty much all the places you visit! We got to try bun cha (noodles and pork), nom thit bo kho (beef salad with papaya), banh cuon bo (steamed rice rolls with beef), various deep fried items (can't remember the name but it had fried fermented sausage, fried spring rolls, fried pillow rolls and a fried doughtnut with mung beans), rieu cua (crab meat soup noodles), sticky rice with ice cream, glutinous rice with shaved ice/coconut milk and a creme caramel, bahn mi and egg coffee. We are definitely more used to nicer restaurants so it was a great insight to the street food world and you're taken into food venues you would have never thought of going into."

We were picked up at our hotel by our guide Phoenix and then travelled to 6 different locations to try the different street food around Hanoi. The amount of food, and the knowledge of the guide was well worth the money paid. Only a light dinner was needed after the tour. We can not recommend this tour enough if you are ever visiting Hanoi."

It goes for 3 hours, we wished it was quicker and that we did a private tours so we could have been in and out of the places quicker. I would highly recommend the street near the cathedral. There is a deaf man across the road making these amazing sugar cane and coconut rolls! His little mobile set up was called BO BIA white with red writing-Ah soo good! And just up from him on the cathedral side there is a place doing amazing fried foods- seriously try them all (52 ly Quoc su)Our tour guide Michelle was great!!"

For three hours, we ate our way through lots of dishes and discovered the most popular dishes in Vietnam. Our guide was professional and bubbly, and our kids especially enjoyed chatting to her about the culture and the food. We liked that we went off the beaten path to eat at the many street restaurants and felt like a local. Well worth the USD$25 per person, which food and drinks are included.

You can do the public group tour for $20USD per person if you prefer - great option if it's just a couple and you would like to do it with more people. Our tour guide Cherry (Hein) was the perfect mix of professional and personal. She was sweet, funny, very knowledgable and had a great sense of humour - she made the evening such a delight. We tried all the traditional foods in places we never would've dared go on our own. Cherry made sure every thing was made fresh for us and we were also able to participate in one of the cooking options. Cherry was fantastic with dietary requirements as one of our group could not eat mushroom and shellfish she ensured that she was catered to at every stop. Definitely wear some comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking - at the first stop you will take off your shoes, but no more after that. It took about 3 hours total and we were so satisfied at the end of it - perfect portions! I couldn't recommend this company enough and make sure you ask for Cherry!"

There are several places we wouldn't have thought to go in to and it is well worth having a local guide. I want to spend more time talking about our guide Kiwi. She was great right from the start. Introduced herself to us ( she is studying food engineering so you know you're in the right hands) and had us all introduce ourselves to each other so we felt like a little family sharing our meals together. She is knowledgeable, funny, interactive and most of all personable ans left a great impression on us all. At the end of the trip we got a list of all the places we had visited along with her personal suggestions for places and foods we hadn't tried. Was an evening well spent in great company.

Although this tour it VERY VERY based on who you get as a guide I highly suggest Vivian, she is the cutest guide and walks at a good pace. She also makes a note of stopping at \"notable landmarks\" in between food stops which is a really nice treat and gives your stomach some time to settle. A couple of nice points of the tour were the fact that when you take a tour like this it pushes you out of your comfort zone, you will eat food from places you probably would not have had you juat walked by them. So you really experience the best Hanoi has to offer. Also by being with a tour you get priority service and the guide is fluent so communicates easily with the restaurant owners. Yes you may go to some \"dirty\"(but delicious restaurants. This is Vietnam as a whole though so deal with it."

We called the day of to put our names in for the tour and it was no problem at all. The groups are small, 10 people max, so it's an intimate group and wonderful to meet fellow travellers. The price is spot on, you could probably get all this food for half the cost but you'd have no idea where to go or what to order, so for the low fee of the tour, it's excellent value for money. Mia was organized and spoke excellent english, she was great at keeping us all together (like sticky rice!). She shared so much about all the foods we tried and the Vietnamese culture and conversational with all of us, also curious to know about our various backgrounds and customs. I heard all the guides are great but Mia was fantastic and I highly recommend her. The tour lasted 3 hours and we went to 6-7 places, water and beer or beverage of your choice is provided, and at the end, Mia wrote down everything we ate and locations so we could return if we wanted to (the next day, we went back to the banh mi spot, it was delish!!). Each stop was unique and different. Not only should you go into the tour with an empty stomach, but go in with an open mind. This isn't a rich country and you won't be eating on silver platters - the best part of the cuisine in North Vietnam is how they prepare, serve and consume it. Become a local for a few hours, put all your worries aside, and you'll love each and every bite you try! I loved how we had a chance to try making the silk pancakes at one of the spots too, that was really fun!"

Our tour guide was Kiwi, and she's seriously the cutest! She took us to 7 places. Along the way, she'd share with us fun little stories whether it be about history or her life. Anyway, I discovered a lot of new Vietnamese food on this tour and am glad I went! My boyfriend and I came pretty hungry and couldn't finish all the food we were presented with. Although I'm not sure if anyone else in our group had that problem. At the end, she even gave us some recommendations for other great foods in the area. If you have the time, I definitely recommend a street food tour!"

She did an excellent job of showing us a lot of the same same types of Vietnamese food that you can find in so many places in the Old Quarter. Her attitude and thoroughness of explaining each dish was different than many other guides we have had on similar tours in other cities. She always took great care to ensure that we were \"sticky rice\" and stayed safe as we roamed through the busy streets. Overall, we definitely recommend."

Walking around Hanoi at night time can be quite scary with all the traffic but Kiwi helped us feel comfortable and safe.The food was excellent. 10 types of food at 7 locations. They were all excellent. The best thing about it was that you eat at places you would never think about going to. The tour really takes you to all the best spots that only locals know about.Highly recommended to anyone thinking about joining."

The tour has a great balance between information about the food and ingredients used in the dishes we tried and life and culture in Ha Noi. Miss Moon was also very helpful in explaining some of the nuances of the Vietnamese language so that we didn't make as many fopaux when we were trying to say little phrases of Vietnamese, such as please and thank you! We were a group of 4 and did the 11am tour with four other travellers (total 8). I recommend that you skip breakfast so that you can enjoy all of the stops! We emailed the night before and arrived at 10.45am to arrange payment. All very relaxed and easy. Thank you Miss Moon! "

However, the drivers felt like they knew what they were doing (it still felt dangerous at some points) and it felt safer than I imagined. The bikes travel in packs, but they did get lost a few times or not know where we were going. I loved that the whole tour is run by women and that all the drivers are women.The food was great and the guide's English was impeccable and she was friendly. However, the tour could have been 3 hours instead of 4- it felt a little long and we were all incredibly full.After being in Hanoi and traveling throughout Vietnam, we realized the major con of this tour is the cost ($60). The food in Vietnam, including these restaurants is excessively cheap. This tour company must pocket a ton of the money, as we were also expected to tip the guides and the drivers (hoping they get paid in more than just tips)."

This is definitely not a food tour, there's very little if anything about food. If you are a foodie or have a slight interest about food you will waste your money and most of all your precious time in Hanoi. If you know nothing about food all you gonna get is a few dishes that have nothing to do with delicious vietnamese cuisine. The places are random, really random and level of organisation is non existing. The guide is saying irrelevant things about eg. how you can get scammed by taxi drivers rather than anything food related. It's not like I didn't know what I'm getting on a plate as being in Vietnam for a couple of days and doing a bit of reading I knew very well, but hey... saying 'this is bun cha it's very famous in hanoi, oh really how come you know it already?' just doesn't do the job. The guide was friendly but certainly with no interest or knowledge about food. Leave alone the fact that being a vegetarian you'll hardly get to eat anything. I got some sort of noodles with leftovers of crab in it and wasn't even told what was it supposed to be?It pays to do your research and pay double or even triple and leave with a full belly and knowledge.I seriously think I would have given a better tour in Hanoi only after doing a little bit of research online. I gave it a shot as I was thinking 70$ for a food tour is way too much but now I so regret I haven't put down the money for a real experience.It's not fun, it's not organised, it's not infomative.. oh I could go on about it for ages.

They are also tuning the tour to your individual requirement, my wife does not eat beef so was given a variation of the salad minus the beef and as I do not drink coffee, I was given iced tea.

The pick up at the hotel worked perfect and we had a great evening riding through the city and trying different foods.We did a number of scooter tours during our trip through south East Asia (in Saigon, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Hanoi). All of them were great as the let you experience a city much better then from a tour bus but this one was definitely one of the best we had.Our guides were very professional and drove us around town safely but at the same time treated us like friends. It was also very nice to talk to them and learn a little bit about life in Hanoi as a local. One of them was working at a bank during the day, and also doing cooking classes.No need to be afraid siting on the back of a motorbike in the crazy traffic all the food even from the smallest food stalls is safe and clean. We had no problems so no need to be afraid here either."

After reading the reviews, we booked this tour upon arrival in Hanoi and spent our first evening wandering through the city with our delightful and charming guide, Kiwi. As others have noted, it was an excellent way to learn about Vietnamese cuisine and to sample a variety of tasty dishes. The food was plentiful, so much so that we could not eat the last 1 or 2 dishes because we were too full. I recommend that you pace yourselves and if you have a small appetite like me, do NOT eat everything at each stop. For the tour operator, it would be helpful if people could opt for smaller sizes, as we did not want to waste anything. The highlight of this tour was Kiwi, who shared personal stories, historical anecdotes, and information about each dish with excellent knowledge and genuine charm and sincerity. This is $20 well-spent!"

We walked around the Old Quarter and ate at 6 or 7 places. This is a great experience for newcomers to Hanoi - we had no idea that most of these restaurants existed, as you have to walk through a small entrance or door which opens up to seating inside. The food was great, we were taken to some of the best places for each dish. There was a crab soup (bun rieu cua) place that we ended up eating at 3x during our stay, it was so good. Phoenix was very knowledgeable about the foods and how they are prepared, which was very informative. She also gave us a lot of general information about Hanoi and the culture, answered any questions we had, and was hilarious. Loved our tour."

So i thought this would be a great crash course on Ha Noi's special and beloved dishes. You are to meet them at their office which is where the street food tour will begin. Ms. Vi, our guide allowed us to taste 6-8 different dishes around Ha Noi such as Bun Cha, che, bahn mi and egg coffee to name a few. She would give us information on the foods, the culture, history etc. crossing the streets with Ms.Vi was something else. She gave us this code: sticky rice, which meant we needed to stick close together when crossing the roads- she was funny in a weird way. All the foods tasted were yummy! a great way to spend a day in Ha Noi!"

She had superb eglish and she was well able for our sense of humour. I think the tour took around 4 and a half/5 hours in total and we visited 8 places. She brought us to some amazing restaurants and we forgot to mention when booking that one of the group was vegetarian and she quickly changed the route to accommodate this. One of our group was also quite sick due to room much fun the night before in some local pubs and Lily was so kind and even brought her to a pharmacy and ordered special food for her to help her stomach. If you book this tour you have to ask for Lily, she will just make it."

We were met at our hotel by our guide Nathan, and joined by two other couples. Within a few minutes walking we had no idea where we were, as the streets were so narrow, and there were so many turnings. However, Nathan obviously knew where he was, and led us to a succession of small \u201clocal restaurants\u201d serving typical local dishes. The places were all quite small, and in some cases we finished up sitting on small plastic chairs.I cannot remember the names of all of the different dishes we ate, but by the time Nathan took us back to our hotel, we were both very tired, and very full!

This tour was a great way for us to see Hanoi - such a busy and chaotic city.We arrived in Hanoi without a scheduled tour and planned on seeing the city ourselves. We realized quickly that it's hard to know where to go. We found Hanoi Street Food Tour on TripAdvisor and chose it based on its overwhelmingly good reviews. We were not disappointed.For people who love food and want to try authentic, non-touristy Hanoi street food safely, this is a great choice. Hanoi Street Food offers scheduled group tours and private tours. Because of our schedule we chose to do a private tour. We met our guide Kiwi at 9 am outside their office in the Old Quarter and started our visit to eight or nine food stops. We had a different dish at each restaurant and were able to learn from Kiwi about the dish, the restaurant and some interesting information about daily Vietnamese life.As we walked around the city, Kiwi explained different things that people were cooking and doing on the street. She also helped us learn how to cross Hanoi's motorbike packed streets.We loved the street food tour and especially our wonderful guide, Kiwi. We would recommend choosing Hanoi Street Food Tour (and we've already been doing so to other tourists we meet)."

We thought we knew Vietnamese food but our wonderful guide Cherry introduced us to things we had never tried before and places we wouldn't dare try on our own - and it was all wonderful. Cherry was enthusiastic and knowledgeable (not just about the food but also about Hanoi). Even the pouring rain didn't detract from the experience - Cherry gave us plastic capes and it just added to the atmosphere. Highly recommend."

When there's western food on offer trying to get teenagers to try the local cuisine is tricky especially as we had no idea what to order. On advise of fellow tourist couple we booked a food street tour at late notice and it was excellent. Our guide named Vi made the whole thing informative but more importantly great fun! She engaged with the teenagers in excellent English and kept them entertained for three hours as they happily tried all sorts of dishes. There's no pressure to eat everything it's just a fun way to learn more more about the food and culture ! Definitely recommend."

            "review": "Old Quarter Street Food Tour was the highlight of my trip!. I highly recommend making this one of the first things you do upon arriving in Hanoi or anywhere in Vietnam, for that matter! Vietnam has some of the most delicious, fresh and exquisite food to be explored and savored and this is the perfect way to dive in and find out so much more than you could if you just chose a restaurant with good reviews.Being a solo traveler, I was lucky because I was able to simply and easily join a group of others without a reservation or much planning at all. I'd read up a bit on TripAdvisor and Kim's Tours was conveniently near to my place. So about an hour after arriving into Hanoi and setting my bags down in my room, I phoned and they said to just come on over. I came, a few minutes past the time I was suppose to and was added to a lovely, well-balanced group of people. I am not personally overly-fond of group tours such as this, but I think we all lucked out with this particular group. There was a lovely family of 5 from Denmark, a fellow female solo traveler from Holland, and a brother and sister from the US who had reunited for a trip together in Vietnam after several years of absence, due to his deployment over seas for the US military. And, of course, worth honorable mention was our wonderful tour guide, Ms Moon, who adorably referred to herself in 3rd person throughout our 3 hour tour and absolutely charmed us with her endearing genuineness, sense of humor and a wealth of relevant information on both the food and Old Quarter! She was such a delight and we all loved her!We started our tour in what I consider the very best place: Bun Cha Ta. The place smelled intoxicatingly of lemongrass and the food was ridiculously divine! Bun cha is now my favorite Vietnamese dish: It's barbecued pork in a hot broth. They bring a plate of noodles out on the side which Ms.Moon instructed us to add into the soup. Then there was a large bowl of the freshest yummiest herbs which you add at your leisure and taste to the bowl as you eat it. You can also add rice vinegar and hot hot chilies. It had all the complexity and goodness people rave about when talking about Vietnamese food! From there, we visited about 11 more places all over the Old Quarter. Some of the places were outside on those lil plastic chairs that you always hear about, some were inside old divey places with little to no ambience but delicious food, none-the-less and some were in lil restaurants like Bun Cha Ta. We got to taste so many good things, I was absolutely on cloud 9! If you're in Hanoi, do yourself a favor and make this one of your first priorities!"

I decided to add a street food walking tour to my itinerary because, in my experience, street food can be hard to experience properly on your own - you simply have no idea what to get or what to do with it. You get picked up from your hotel by cyclo, which is pretty awkward, but maybe you will find being conspicuously pedaled around fun:). During the course of the evening we tried about 6 or 7 different places, and our guide Sunny (who had an excellent command of English) took us a fruit vendor to try various tropical fruits - which I appreciated because I mentioned I have never tried a mangosteen. The food was delicious, accompanied by helpful commentary from Sunny. At the very end, we tried the famous egg coffee and rice wine that came from a coconut and tasted super yummy (unlike straight up rice wine which tastes like pure alcohol). I paid a fraction of what I paid for a food tour in Saigon, but it was just as good. Highly recommended, even if you think you know a lot about Vietnamese food."

It'll give you an overall learning experience of Vietnamese cuisine, and it worked out great for my brother and I who only had two days to experience Hanoi. Our guide was Miss Moon, she was stupendous and I recommend her without reservation. During every stop she would explain the different foods, it's uses, how to eat it, any backdrop story it has, how it relates to Vietnamese culture, etc, she was on point with everything. It was a great experience to try all the savory and sweet foods, from fried spring rolls, Pho, fruit compote with coconut milk, beef noodles, and so forth. I feel it gave us a worthwhile experience of all the flavors we could possibly experience in Vietnamese cuisine. It'll be a worthwhile experience, learn about the amazing dishes of this culture while meeting great people from all over the world. The tour ends with a tasty Vietnamese sandwich, a beer and a delicious Egg Yolk Coffee. We couldn't wait to review the Food Tour and Miss Moon so highly!Forewarned, there is a lot of walking (and eating, of course), so be prepared for a great mini adventure around Hanoi city, this activity certainly isn't for the sedentary lifestyle folks. Also, this food tour has all sorts of meat, dairy, and peanuts....So, for those who are vegetarian or vegan, I recommend discussing this with the Food Tour representatives beforehand to see if something can be worked out as well. Overall, I loved the experience my brother and I had with the Food Tour! I would do it again and ask for Miss Moon, what a delightful experience!"

We would never had ventured into them as they looked very questionable but the food was tasty.Sadly the variety was not great in terms of what alternatives were available. My girlfriend does not eat red meat so there was a lot she could not try and most dishes were just given without meat (no substitutes like pork available).Nonetheless, I would recommend it if you have not tried Vietnamese food but don't expect weird food, for example tarantulas like we had in Cambodia."

My guide Cherry (Hien) was excellent. She took me to little out-of-the-way places that i would never have found on my own, but that served the most delicious, fresh food. I also ate all sorts of food that i wouldn't have dared to try and order on my own! Cherry explained how each dish is made and had lots of stories to tell about Hanoi, its food, people and history. She spoke perfect English and even managed to teach me some Vietnamese. I had a brilliant time - highly recommend this tour!"

She talked not only about the food but also about Vietnam, Hanoi and many other things (such as where to go for good bargains, activities around the area, etc.)We ate at places we would not have dared to had it not been for the tour. The selection of dishes were varied and each one selected to highlight the best food in Hanoi. The Vietnamese egg coffee was a pleasant surprise... it was sooo good! It was truly a great way to spend 3 hours and a bargain for $20. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Hanoi."

Our family of five thoroughly enjoyed the food tour despite a torrential downpour half way through that lasted the best part of an hour, which threatened to cut short our tasting. However, our drivers (all women) were fantastic: they quickly found shelter then went off and bought us raincoats to help keep us dry. The rain somewhat spoiled the trip from our point of view, largely because the visibility in the rain was poor and there was a lot of water on the road, so this made for a more nervous ride from our point of view. However, the drivers coped admirably. As well as being expert riders, they were very friendly. Our guide was brilliant - very knowledgeable, great at explaining each dish and really personable. The food was delicious if a little 'safe': we didn't really feel that we tasted much that was different to what we had previously eaten in local restaurants. We would have liked at least one of the dishes to have been a bit more unusual. Overall, though, we would highly recommend the food tour."

Found it surprising that only one dish was actually eaten on the street though. All others were in dingy, HOT rooms upstairs or out the back. But maybe this is the norjm?We had about seven dishes but i thought it weird we had dessert then Banh Mi, when we were all stuffed full.It did seem also that most of them were toned down for the western tourists palette which made some undrwhelming. I was looking forward to lots of chilli, herbs and flavours.Also - no pho! I thought Hanoi was the birthplace of Pho.All in all though we enjoyed the tour and would recommend it. I'm sure it is more enjoyable when its not as hot / humid too."

I was picked up from my hotel by Sam and given my first invigorating experience on the back of a scooter through the streets of Hanoi and the old quarter, to the main office for payment. From there it was straight into the tour. Money was a great host and tour guide. She takes an interest in all her guests. Thoughtful, considerate and organised. There was myself and a family of 3 for this tour. We all had a great time. All the food was explained at each venue, it's cultural significance within Vietnamese society and how it may differ from the food in southern Vietnam. I won't go into detail of each venue; it's nice to get a surprise, there is a variety of super fresh food, super tasty and the option for seconds was there as well, but I can guarantee that it most likely won't be necessary. Also the young man from the family had a nut allergy, that was also very carefully taken into consideration. Money, Sam and the rest of the girls will definitely look after you and keep you safe. As well asThis tour was a great way to see a part of Hanoi at night, and on the back of a scooter it's quite a bit cooler.

You'd better start this tour very hungry, or you won't be able to sample the long parade of amazing food which you find whilst wandering the streets of Hanoi old town. There were eight or nine stops on our tour, which included bun cha, tropical fruit salads, banh my, pork and shrimp rice pancakes, green bean ice lollies, egg coffee... the list goes on! All the time, Lili talked us through what we were eating, how the restaurant business has evolved in Hanoi, and a very interesting trick for spotting the oldest and best established restaurants... If you want to find out what it is, you'll have to go on the tour! Thanks to Lili for lifting the lid on Hanoi for us! "

The places we visited for food were a great entry into the Vietnamese street food cuisine and will make ordering food in Vietnam much easier now! Our guide Duong spoke great English and happily answered all our questions. On the tour she stopped to show us points of interest around Hanoi and the history.If you have just arrived in Hanoi this is a great tour as not only do you get to eat delicious traditional food but you get to familiarize yourself with the area."

A nice mixture between restaurants/ plastic table corner stalls and street stalls that even let you try doing pancakes on your own. Overall an excellent experience if you are looking for good quality yet safe and authentic food! Around 6-7 different dishes with nice walks in between (to digest!), better not to overeat in the beginning so you'll make it through to dessert ;)Our guide was Cherry, a lovely and super energetic mid 20's graduate who shared lots of personal stories and anekdotes about Hanoian culture and habits!

The food was actually all lovely (although if anything, too much food for me!) and we visited places that we would never had found for ourselves. THeir knowledge about the dishes, the regions they came from and how they were prepared were excellent and they also answered all my questions about life in Vietnam.

Banh mi - a street sandwich. I would suggest the barbecue pork one. It's fantastic!!! 3. Chicken skewers - if they have a chili sauce have them give it to you! 4. Coconut candies - they're like a creamy coding caramel. Don't be afraid to try the street food! My mantra was... I'll try anything once. Be careful not to eat things that are raw or undercooked, though. And watch out for fruits and veggies that are washed with water. The water is not drinkable and will make you sick! Use common sense. Always drink bottled water. Always."

If we had been food tour virgins we probably would have thought it was quite good but because we had something to compare it to I'm afraid it fell short. Our guide was friendly and nice enough but she left us for periods of time whilst we were eating and we felt that she could have been more informative and talkative. Maybe she was just having an off day. The food was tasty enough but again nothing mind blowing. I've read in other reviews that people got beer but this was never offered to us. Do it if you're new to the country and the food but otherwise I would perhaps look for another tour."

We went to a variety of different street food venues. They were all very authentic, but very clean and delicious!

There were 6 of us in the group and we walked about Hanoi tasting all the local cuisine and it is some of the best food I have ever eaten in my life! The food is so fresh and sometimes killed straight in front of you so you know it's fresh! Some of the places we went to eat didn't look the cleanest but they ended up having the tastiest food! Sunny never stopped taking us to places until we eventually told her we were full and then she said her job was complete lol! A must try is egg coffee when you are in Vietnam it is a local delicacy and you won't taste coffee as delicious anywhere else! Please go on this trip!!"

That said, I would definitely recommend NOT eating the day of the tour, until the tour.:)The historical anecdotes provided by Phoenix were also superb.

She even prepared a list of all of our stops at the end, and wrote the addresses down for us, so we could return later in our trip if we wanted to! We tried a number of the foods we sampled on the tour at later points in our stay, at very nice restaurants, and we must say, that while it was all good, none of it quite matched the food we tried on the food tour with Cherry! This is a must do early on in your trip to Hanoi! Highly recommended."

Some of the places we went did not even have a restaurant exterior. Not only did we learn about Vietnamese food customs and Hanoi specialties, Lily also answered all of our off topic questions about Vietnamese culture. We ended up talking about Vietnamese weddings (often 200 - 1000 guests!!). The tour had a relaxed vibe. We definitely did not feel rushed going from place to place.After the tour Lily showed us where the Beer drinking street of Hanoi was and our entire group stayed out for a few drinks together.Lily is clearly passionate about food and her city and she has a natural gift with people.

It was worth it. Dzuong was very knowledgeable and gave other recommendations on what to do while in Hanoi."

Sunny Hi! we miss you and your beautiful smile!Okay, we are from Texas! wanted something to do and like you we went to trip advisor and the #1 thing to do was the street food tour and we were not disappointed. It exceeded our expectations. Don't eat breakfast, book a 3 hour private tour with Sunny and tell her all about youself. She loves to talk about life...so contageous. We had no idea what to do in Hanoi but we heard we would like it. We booked our trip through Kims tours here 74 H\u00e0ng B\u1ea1c, Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm, H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i 08404, Vietnam. It was 40,000 kip ($2.00) for a tuktuk anywhere in the old city to get here. We went through back alleys, side streets, hidden stairways and back doors to experience Hanoi eating in only a way a local could. It was a wonderful insight to life here. Sunny spoke perfect English and took us to seven different restaurants and even wrote down the location addresses, and what we ate there. Thank you again Sunny. We will never forget you and our experience there!"

I had been in Vietnam for almost a month and had eaten a lot of delicious food all around the country, but still I found this tour to be very worthwhile! Not only was it fun and led by the wonderful Kim, \"sticky rice!!\", but we had some DELICIOUS meals! As a vegetarian I found it intimidating to order street food because I wasn't sure how to ask for it without meat, so I figured this would be my chance to eat at really local places. I wasn't disappointed, we went to so many great shops and really got to see how the food is made and learned so much about the culture. It was a fun way to meet people too and we all went out for bia hoi afterwards. Great day!"

She was funny, spoke perfect English and was so nice; a huge part of what made the tour so fun were her stories and jokes. I am a vegetarian and told her ahead of time not to worry too much about accommodating me as I don't have a huge appetite anyway, and was more doing the tour for my husband. At every stop, she ensured there was a vegetarian option for me. At one place she even insisted on me not tasting the soup until she went downstairs and made sure with the staff that there was no fish sauce in it. Not only that, at a stop near the end of the tour when she went in to get beers for everyone, I was craving a diet coke and snuck out to quickly get one. Mango literally chased after me and bought it for me, insisting that it was included in the cost of the tour. She totally went above and beyond to make the experience comfortable and fun. There was soooo much food, all delicious and interesting. We are very full and very happy with our decision to do this tour. Highly recommended!"

We had 7 courses over lunch and this was more than enough as there is just so much variety to choose from. All the dishes were great and suitable for adults and kids alike. You'll find yourself navigating winding alleyways and crossing crazy intersections as you eat meals on the curb side, up tight and twisting staircases and in air conditioned sweet dessert shops.

I only had two days in Viet Nam, and I am so glad that I spent them on these tours. Even though it cost more, I would strongly suggest the motorbike tours. They were an amazing way to cover a lot of ground and experience the sights, sounds, and smells of the city...not to mention a great way to beat traffic and stay cool. Both motorbike drivers (Annie and Cherry) were safe and effective in getting me around.My first tour was the 8 hour city tour with Cherry. I had a list of many places that I wanted to see, and we covered almost all of them. Cherry did a great job of explaining the highlights of each attraction (in good English) as well as explaining the local culture. She did a particularly good job as allotting the right amount of time for each attraction. At some, we just looked at it from the motorbike, which was perfectly acceptable as I would not have wanted to do anything other than look at it any way. At others, we went inside and I was treated to an in depth \"lesson\" about what I was seeing. Lunch and snacks were delicious and informative. The tour was so good that I decided to dedicate part of my second day to another tour. The second tour I took was the evening street food tour by motorbike. My guide was Annie. Her English is perfect, and she did a safe and amazing job driving us around. In fact, she picked me up in the rain and dropped me off in a torrential down pour. This was perhaps one of the most exciting parts of the tour. Fortunately, it only rained at the beginning and end of the tour. The hours in-between were spend eating the most amazing assortment of foods and learning about Vietnamese food and culture from Annie. I had such a good time discussing table manners, how people eat and cook at home, and how the small businesses are managed. Truly an multifaceted and well designed tour. The food was delicious and plentiful...not just samples. Lot's of food ending with an amazing dessert. All in all, I cannot recommend these tours, and the tour guides, enough. I so glad that I chose to spend the bulk of my time in Vietnam on them."

Due to an mixup on their end, she didn't realize we had a tour but came right away to the office and without missing a beat gave a great tour. We were there people and are all vegetarian. She showed us some great places ending with fresh beer, delicious banh mi, and egg roll coffee. She was a really delight to be with. We had a great time."

We booked a private group tour since there were so many of us and had the best time tasting all the local food. Cherry entertained us with lots of stories and shared her local knowledge. She was super friendly and interested in helping us explore the local food culture. Especially delicious was the Bun Cha from Bun Cha Ta - most of us went back several times during our stay. Thanks for such an awesome day!! It was a highlight of the trip."

We had an amazing young guide, \"Mango\" who spoke excellent English and introduced us to a number of Vietnamese delicacies and special treats on our private walking tour. She was very knowledgable and added to the experience with local and cultural insights. We experienced cuisine and dined at places we wouldn't otherwise have gone to. A little adventurous, but perfectly OK. Great value and overall an enjoyable evening in Hanoi's old quarter. Mango was genuinely interested in our experience and welfare. \"Sticky rice\" will happily be remembered. Would recommend."

They picked us up from our hotel and took us to their office before we set off! Both ladies were fantastic drivers and we loved every minute of it! The food was great as you got to try many portions from different shops. It's good to have you a guide to assure you that the food you are eating is safe. Come with an appetite as you'll be extremely full by the end! The motorbike was great fun as you got to whizz around with the locals. We also got to go over a bridge that was only for bikes that had a great view. Money would stop at many sights to give you a break from eating and to give you some info! Her English was great and she would answer any and all of our questions! Thanks for such a fantastic night ladies! We highly recommend this to all. I am 21 and my mum came on the tour too!

So this tour directs you through the maze of Hanoi to some places with great food that you might easily overlook. Kiwi was a great tour guide -- she showed us key local gems, walked us through some hoppin' Hanoi streets on a busy Saturday night, and established a warm and friendly group-dynamic right from the start. She made sure that we enjoyed the food we had, even asking for our feedback at the end, and didn't rush us from place to place (a 3 hour tour ended up being 3.5 hours because of how chatty our group was). Her English was clear and lucid."

With our passionate Vietnamese food enthusiast tour guide - Donut, we were introduced 7 different type of food! including:grilled pork noodle (Obama's fav), dried beef salad, steamed cake stuffed with mushroom and pork, assorted deep fried savory donuts, sticky rice ice-cream, Vietnamese sandwich, egg coffee/chocolate.Of course each of the portion is reduced so we can try everything. But after that we were all very full, so prepare an empty stomach!The tour's meeting point is easy to find. The guide is very friendly introducing us food while teaching us basic Vietnamese. She also helped and led us when crossing the road. The Vietnamese name of the food was given at the end of the tour, so we could go and find our favourite after the tour. As we joined the grouped tour, we were able to meet new friends as well!In general, it is well worth the money and highly recommended to everyone especially for those who want to try the best Vietnamese food in 3 hours!"

It was excellent but did not cover food which is such an integral part of life in Vietnam. So, using trip advisor we decided to book a street food tour on the back of a scooter. I'm sure a walking tour would have been good but I have to say we covered so much more ground on the back of the scooters and in this heat it made a welcome change from walking. Our guide 'Money' and her friend we not only wonderful guides but also great scooter drivers, it was great to be out there whizzing along side all the others. We went to about 5 different places where we had one course at each place. You do need to do this trip on a very empty stomach, there is just soo much food. In addition to covering many of the streets in the old quarter they also took us out across the old bridge which only the trains and scooters are able to use (no cars) this was a real bonus for us. All in all a fabulous trip and highly recommended. We did the 11.30 one."

She also took pains to show us the sights and explained the significance of various landmarks. Both were great drivers and took us down some very narrow lanes.

I am a major food enthusiast, and the food did not disappoint. During our stay in Hanoi, we got other recommendations from people for their favorite Bun Cha, Bahn Mi, etc, and none compared to Miss Moon's selections. She doesn't choose the most popular spot, but she does choose the best. Even though I didn't think we would, we ended up going back to a lot of the places Miss Moon took us on the tour. We even ran into her at one of the places a few days later, and she remembered us and sat down with us and chatted for a bit and gave us some pineapple she had. So sweet! I highly recommend this food tour! I miss that Bun Cha!"

I did a walking street tour in the late afternoon with tour guide Mango and she was very enthusiastic and helpful in describing local food and Vietnamese culture to us. She was funny and told jokes along the way, and made the 3 hours fly by with many yummy foods. Definitely come hungry.Also very easy to walk into the tour agency office 10-15 min before the tour times, and sign up directly. The tour agency office is in a very central part of the old quarter near the lake. I also did a Cyclo tour which takes you around the streets of the Old Quarter and see everything at a leisurely pace and allow you to take photos without worrying about street traffic."

We had about 10 different foods and a local beer and I wasn't disappointed. The flavours of Hanoi are unique and you will be craving them from that day on.My ultimate favourite was the bo bia from the street cart with the fresh shredded coconut. Miss Moon wrote down all the foods we had and the addresses so we could go back if we wanted. The next evening I did exactly that and revisited some of these places.If you want an introduction to Vietnamese food and a flavour party in your mouth that you will forever dream of, I highly recommend this tour.And to Miss Moon, your beautiful smile and effervescent personality will be one I will always remember."

All drivers know the \"rules\" and it definitely works.

My favourites included Bun Cha (BBQ pork noodle soup), papaya salad, spring rolls (fresh and fried), rice pancakes stuffed with pork and mushrooms, and the fresh fruit and coconut milk. The evening of gastronomy was topped off by a delicious Glass of Bia Hoi (fresh beer) and a cup of the famous Hanoi 'egg coffee' - absolutely divine. We were VERY full by the end of the evening.

Ha was great company, easy to chat with and enthusiastic. She was very knowledgeable and happy to answer any of our questions about the food and Vietnamese way of life. We tried a whole range of dishes at different stops, including egg coffee which is unique to Hanoi. It tasted great - definitely worth a try! Ha even stopped at a street vendor so we could try out some of the unusual fruits that we hadn't come across before such as mangolese and dragonfruit. Thank you, Ha.

That means that we paid $40-$12 worth of food =$28 value of...??? Also, our guide did not eat the food with us. Which made us feel like the food is not to her standards, why are we eating it then? Food itself was okay, we only liked 2 stops. Following day we both felt a bit ill. The cleanliness of the street food places we feel may be attributed to this."

The one of the amazing things that can relish in Hanoi is the Street Food stalls along most of the streets if Old Quarters.Every turn you take it will take you back to about 30-40 years Asian way of life. If you are a must savour local food person, then this is the right place to go. You can find on the streets most local dishes, while the tiny restaurants do offer western and other Asian food.Street food are very reasonably priced, while those at the restaurants are quite pricey.However, a word of caution, street food may not be 100% clean, but if you have the stomach for it, there is no harm trying.Have the experience of sitting around with the locals in street drink shops and munch away with melon seeds. It is an experience which you will never find in a developed country.Try the local fruit cocktails with various condiments at these sidewalk shops. They are pretty good."

Her English was very good too and she was very fast to find dishes catering to the vegetarian in our group. Lua took us to 8 different places and we tried at least 8-10 different dishes and drinks. We were so full by the end of the tour, no room for another bite! It was really a great introduction to Hanoi and lovely to walk around the Old Quarter in the evening. We highly recommend taking a private tour, we were 2 people paying 30 USD each and it made it really easy to ask questions and engage with the guide. Thank you Lua for a great evening!"

The smells and site had been wonderful to see during the day if wondering around the town, but one is always wary of buying something that is literally served on the side of a dirty street. Taking a tour means that the guide has (or should have!) been there before and made sure that clients do not get sick. The Asian stomach and the western one are not the same and you mush make sure that they allow for western sensitivities while still giving you the full experience. If you can, get the guide to finish off the tour in beer corner. Never iN my life have I seen such a hectic place not had a couple of beers literally sitting in the street drinking beer. An experience I will never forget. Highly recommended."

Moreover, there is also the typical and popular \"pho\" (a soup with rice-noodles to which chicken, pork, vegetables may be added).

Definitely arrive hungry as you'll roll home! The trip intersperses info about Hanoi (although with big group and busy bustling Hanoi can be difficult to hear what the guide is saying) and obviously info about the food evolution and culture which was great. It is a perfect introduction to Vietnamese street food and being taken into some places and back streets you would never find if you were not a seasoned visitor. It's nice to be taken to places you feel can be trusted if you're slightly apprehensive about street food (which annoyingly I am!). The courses alternate between savoury and sweet. My favourite was the first place we went for Bun Cha and my husbands was the grilled pork. I also loved the ice cream we were introduced to and ate lots more before we left. Pixie was lovely and informative and really amazing at answering questions and dealing with allergies and dislikes (you are asked at the beginning of the tour). Some people wanted to learn more about the actual cooking process so a little token guidebook/recipe book to cover some of the things we try, or a list of where we go and what we eat (the names etc) would be really useful. Pixie wrote it down on paper after it was requested which was above and beyond, and so really great. But I suspect many more would like this so it's something that they could offer...even email it to everyone if printing is too expensive. In summary, we were absolutely thrilled we went on this tour and would highly recommend it. 3 hours of eating delicious food (I was personally really pleased it was mainly pork dishes and prawn and nothing such as dog) exploring Hanoi, learning the culture and navigating the crazy roads is a wonderful intro into a very busy and culturally rich city."

The tour is 3 hours with lots of food stops, so come hungry!We took the 5pm tour and hit up Bia Corner afterward -- was a great night!"

It's a must do if you are in Hanoi - the city has amazing food, but typically the menu's are in vietnamese, and frankly it's hard to know what and where to try. Our tour guide was great and we loved being able to join a few other travelers. Just make sure to come hungry and save room for the end! Also the walking is pretty minimal for anyone worried about that."

We were a group of seven people --- mixture of family and friends of different ages (27 to 62) and dietary restrictions (vegetarian, spice sensitive and spice lover). Our vegetarian member had just as much fun and as many food options as the rest of us. The Bun cha was the first and best dish of the day! The egg coffees and cocoas were different and quite tasty. Phoenix navigated the traffic and roadways quite well with our large group. We did the tour on our first day and her guidance and suggestions were all very helpful even beyond the food tour. She followed up the tour with emAiled suggestions about wedding dress tailors and even offered to help us with communicating more complex conversations. I highly recommend Phoenix and this tour for those that are interested in a friendly and knowledgeable introduction to Hanoi's food and culture. "

The tour was enjoyable and the food was all good, although I would have preferred a slightly more adventurous selection of dishes (skip the bahn mi for some grilled eel?). We had a nice group of 8 so it was a fun social evening, the downside was it was a little hard for everyone to follow the explanations of the dishes at times. Overall well worth your time and money!"

We went on the 11am tour and were glad that we did as most of the food places did not have a queue.Make sure not to eat breakfast as you would be so full at the end. I think this tour is best done as one of the first things on your trip as it gives you a good understanding of how to avoid tourist traps, and the significance of certain streets.Food wise, nothing really blew my mind but that may be just my tastebuds. However, our guide Miss Moon wrote down more food places to try after the tour and that was a nice touch."

It ended up being a group of 8 of us (plus a small child), it wasn't too many - it was a really friendly group and the guide, Phoenix, was great at making sure we were all crossing the road together and able to hear the information she was sharing throughout the walk. I had been a bit worried about it being a bit expensive at 20 dollars but after 6 dishes at some of the most famous places among local we would never have known to go otherwise and drinks (beer and fresh beer) included along the way, it really was great value for money. Phoenix was also one of the best guides we've had in Vietnam with great English. This tour is a great thing to do just as you arrive in Hanoi as then you can go back to some of the fantastic places!"

My partner is gluten intolerant but our wonderful guide (Pixie) was able to advise on what could and could not be eaten. We ate amazing food in places that we would never have thought of going to ( or could have found ) . Pixie not only described the food but gave us a potted history of Hanoi.

Our guide, Sunny, was a cheerful, friendly navigator of a whole variety of spots we'd never have noticed or found too intimidating to try, especially in the middle of the craziness of Saturday night in the city and the melee of scooters and people it involves. We opted to pay the extra $10 per head for a private tour, and for us it made sense - trying to navigate the back streets in a big group would have been daunting. We found the tour perfectly paced - over three hours we sampled pho, bun cha, spring rolls, dumplings, banh mi and several other dishes, with a short walk between each. As a sit-down dinner it would probably have been too much, but the ability to burn a few calories between courses made the difference.As a way to jump into the middle of Hanoi at night without the stress of navigating and paying at each stall/restaurant (never mind finding them in the first place) I think this tour is ideal. Thanks again to Sunny for introducing us to some wonderful food and nightlife!(\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3067\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u66f8\u304d\u8fbc\u307e\u306a\u3044\u9650\u308a\u6587\u5b57\u6570\u304c\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305a\u6295\u7a3f\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3067\u3082\u77ed\u3081\u306e\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6dfb\u3048\u307e\u3059\u3002)\u30cf\u30ce\u30a4\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30fc\u30c9\u5165\u9580\u30fb\u8857\u305d\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u3002\u884c\u304d\u4ea4\u3046\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u4eba\u3054\u307f\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u7d76\u5bfe\u306b\u6c17\u4ed8\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3001\u3042\u308b\u3044\u306f\u6c17\u4ed8\u3044\u305f\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u5165\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u304a\u5e97\u3092\u6570\u591a\u304f\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3048\u308b\u3002\u5024\u6bb5\u306f\u524d\u6255\u3044\u306730\u30c9\u30eb\u3068\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30ca\u30d6\u30eb(\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d9\u30fc\u30c8\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u306e\u5834\u5408)\u3002\u3053\u306e\u5024\u6bb5\u306b\u5168\u3066\u306e\u6599\u7406\u3068\u98f2\u307f\u7269\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u308b\u306e\u3067\u983b\u7e41\u306b\u8ca1\u5e03\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u652f\u6255\u3044\u3092\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u3082\u306a\u3044\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3082\u98df\u3079\u7269\u306e\u30af\u30a9\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306f\u629c\u7fa4\u306b\u826f\u304f\u3001\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u306a\u30d9\u30c8\u30ca\u30e0\u6599\u7406\u306f\u3060\u3044\u305f\u3044\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b(\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u306e\u9eba\u985e\u3001\u6625\u5dfb\u3001\u30a8\u30c3\u30b0\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3001\u30d0\u30a4\u30f3\u30df\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u306a\u3069)\u3002\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u30b5\u30cb\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u7d4c\u6e08\u5b66\u90e8\u5352\u696d\u3057\u305f\u3066\u306e\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3082\u660e\u308b\u304f\u4eba\u61d0\u3063\u3053\u3044\u6027\u683c\u3060\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u81ea\u5206\u305f\u3061\u3082\u5168\u304f\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u306a\u304f\u30cf\u30ce\u30a4\u306e\u591c\u3092\u6e80\u55ab\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u7d76\u5bfe\u306b\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u306e\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u3067\u3059\u3002"

Our guide Lua was great, spoke English well and made sure to keep us safe in the very busy traffic and also very informed about what we were eating and how to eat it. We also loved the little bits of Vietnam history and culture she added which made it very informative as well.The tour is a great introduction to Vietnamese street food and I would definitely recommend doing it early in your visit to learn what and where to eat. We went to about 9 or 10 places in the old quarter and the price was very affordable at $20 USD and definitely worth it. "

The bicycle tour was fun, however please note that the pollution in Hanoi is very high. But you will see lots of the Old Town.Afterwards we did the Food tour with lovely Mrs Moon. She is a great tour guide and speaks very good English. We visited about 7 or 8 different restaurants and sampled beautiful food. I almost gave up after the third one as it is plenty of food, but its clever organised as you will get fruit salad in between and feel refreshed, so you can start with more hearty food again! Mrs Moon even helped us organise a taxi after the tour as we were to tired to walk afterwards (especially our son). Would book this tour again!!"

Told to arrive at 6-15, but got there at 6-20 to be told no spaces left now on 6-30 tour as we are late. Had to join the 7-00pm tour? Also, the 7-00pm tour is more expensive than 6-30... This was soon forgotten as we started our tour with Cherry, very enthusiastic girl who made the evening a fantastic experience.The tour took us to places that we would never have tried if we weren't on this tour but that only made it much more of a special treat for us. We only had 6 on our tour which was a lovely amount to get to know the others throughout the evening.We started with Bun Cha, then moved on to try beef and papaya salad. On again and pork skewers from a street cart, then some savoury pancakes which we all had a go at making ourselves, great fun.The after stopping at the cathedral on for a beer and 'beer food' and then to dessert (probably the best I've ever tasted) coconut ice cream and black coffee flavoured sticky rice with yoghurt. Finally on to get an egg coffee to finish the evening off. A strange concept to us but really delicious. Along the way we learned some history of Hanoi and a couple of Vietnamese words, as well as how to conquer crossing the roads..Everything we ate and drank was included in the price, we thought excellent value.I would highly recommend this tour....be brave and go for it.!"

Annie was our guide together with her band of riders who took our small group of 4 as pillions. While the places we visited could technically be within reach of walking, but weaving through the \"organised chaos\" of the Hanoi traffic (safely, of course) is not to be missed.The street food experience felt just right in the evening, with throngs of locals all around as well on the Friday evening. And the food choices? Diverse yet each so very palatable.Tummies were filled by the end of 2 hours, but the additional hour brought further delights from the street vendors of Hanoi. Annie was patient, knowledgeable and sincere with an excellent command of English. She also very kindly wrote down all the names, description and addresses of the food that we tried, with additional recommendations that we could not cover. We covered the rest on our later days in the trip and also went back for more for those that we particularly loved. Could not be happier!Zero qualms in recommending this tour. If you're short on time or are a small eater, try the 2 hour version. If you're terrified of riding on a motorcycle, take the walking tour. At the end of the day, you will get to know the streets and the food like you would very unlikely to be able to on your own, and certainly not in that short span of time."

Ended up having Cherry as our guide (Cheery Cherry as she called herself--shoes with smiley faces on them exemplified this), and overall we couldn't have been happier with the experience. Was great fun going through the market early in the day, and the experience of eating delicious dishes at local places that we may have otherwise passed by was an invaluable part of our time in Vietnam. Afterwards, we still had plenty of time to explore the other major sites in the city, shop, and have a nice dinner, so don't hesitate to do the tour even if you have limited time in Hanoi.

She took us to eight different eateries (actually one was a brewery!), places we would probably never have experienced ourselves. Most restaurants don't look like much, in fact some look a bit dingy, but the food is ALWAYS super fresh and very tasty. Miss Moon, who always refers to herself in third person, told us stories about each dish, explained some local eating habits and was a wonderful guide. This tour was basically a three-hour lunch with a LOT of food.

Phoenix took this seriously and took great care of us ; the food was amazing and we were more than full at the end! The street food tour was a great way to see the old quarter and learn about the food at the same time, not to mention learning how to use chopsticks, cross the crazy roads, sample the local beer at \"beer corner\" and see a few sights along the way! Phoenix wrote a list of everything we had eaten at the end of the tour so that we could always find a nut free safe meal during the rest of our holiday. 100% recommended. Egg coffee v good too!

If you are going to do a street food tour only do it at the very beginning of your trip, otherwise you are going to discover most of this food yourself during your travels. Almost everything we had we had commonly seem in restaurants all over the country already, nothing unique on the tour. We booked with Hanoi Street Food Tour because their website stated they can accommodate vegetarians. We also emailed them to double check and clarify the definition of vegetarian. Turns out their idea of accommodating means some places I couldn't eat at all and when I could nothing was supplemented, I just got whatever bits were left after all the animal was removed. Didn't always leave much or very tasty versions. I had much better adapted veggie versions of most of the food elsewhere during our trip. Also veggies beware- the 'veggie' soups they serve are made from meat stock and fish sauce. I paid the same rate as everyone else to still be hungry at the end of the tour. Totally not worth it."

The coffee at the end packs a punch (in a good way if you want to party for the rest of the night!) and the lemon and mint ice lolly by the lake was a refreshing way to cleanse the palate. Be prepared to walk on busy roads rather than the pavement, not have access to toilets and expect the cafes where they don't always appear obvious. Our guide Annie was really lovely, so friendly and so knowledgeable we couldn't have asked for anyone better!"

This was a great way to experience some of the wonderful street foods offered in this great street food city that you might not otherwise stumble upon.  Our guide, Mango, was informative, not just about the food but about Vietnamese life in general,and very entertaining and funny. The group was ten people and all were convivial and easy to get along with. Mango ushered us safely through the crowded streets of Hanoi.  Well worth doing this tour early in your Hanoi visit as there will likely be places you want to go back to for another taste. Highly recommended way to spend a little over three hours. Make sure you skimp on lunch as there will be more than enough to eat and drink!"

Her energy, food knowledge and great organisation really made the tour.The tour took us to multiple locations (all on foot) to sample all the different foods that I read about (bun cha, Viet egg coffee, banh mi among others). The best part was having a local tour guide in Phoenix took all the guess work out of where and what to eat. Without local knowledge it can be easy to miss places or foods because you're apprehensive or don't have the local knowledge. This tour gives you a taste of everything and I went back to a couple of the places later in my trip!The tour itself is non-stop walking and eating. It's well organised and I couldn't recommend it highly enough. A must do if you are staying in Hanoi!"

Go on the food tour and you'll discover a number of delicious Vietnamese dishes, overcome your fear of street food, and get a great tour of the old historic district of Hanoi. Four of us were led by an engaging 23-year-old Vietnamese man who spoke excellent English. I've sort of lost track of all the dishes but they included papaya salad, a noodle dish, a rice dish, a mix of grilled pork with outstanding spring rolls. We learned not only about the food but about the life of a young Vietnamese man. He has a degree in hospitality management but is continuing to train to improve his professional opportunities. He told us he has to do three things: get married, get a job and buy a motorized vehicle (most likely he'll live in a rental). Be prepared, you have to be able to sit down on the low, child-sized plastic stools at each food stall and climb some serious stairs to get to the final stop on the tour which is down a narrow hidden hallway. You will end up on a rooftop over-looking the lake and drinking the delicious egg coffee. We all loved it. Delicious. Fun. Informative. Go."

We tried 7 dishes, a dessert, and our tour included a beer and a shot of rice liquor. All of the food was incredible and the restaurants were usually ones I wouldn't have even thought to step foot into, but after you get through the entrance, they turned into cute Vietnamese local eateries. The egg coffee weirded me out at first, but it was actually quite nice! For the price, this tour can't be beat. The only thing that I thought was strange was that pho wasn't included in the tour, but I figure that the reasoning is because people just know to try pho when they come to Vietnam, but don't know about all of the other amazing soups and dishes."

We did their bike tour and compared to previous experiences in other locations it was OK, but not great.We had done a bike tour a few days earlier in Saigon (Back of the Bike Tours) and really enjoyed it. They set a really high standard for us that the Hanoi Street Food Tour didn't meet. There's nothing wrong with their tour, but it's not as well done as we had experienced in Saigon.Comparing the two, I'd have to say these are my 3 biggest items of feedback for Hanoi Street Food Tour:1. Little driver interaction. On the other tour we got to know our drivers, learned about them and their background. The drivers on the Hanoi Street Food Tour sat at another table and chatted amongst themselves while we ate. My driver seemed quite shy at best and never ate with us.2. No menu. A the end of the night, I had no idea what I'd eaten or where I could go to get more of it. The other tour gave us a menu at the start of the night and an information booklet at the end telling us some stuff we could do next.3. One beer. For the entire night I received one beer to drink at one location. Whilst I don't expect a beer at every stop, one beer at one stop wasn't enough. It's not because I didn't ask either, I requested it at several locations, but my wish was only granted at once.The food was pretty good. There was plenty of it and some good diversity. But the non-food part of the tour was lacking."

Stopping by a street cart for a snack of bo bia (a sweet wrap filled with crunchy sugar cane, shredded coconut and sesame seeds) also made for a welcome surprise.I strongly recommend that all Hanoi newbies experience this street food tour - we even revisited some of the stops before heading back home to Hong Kong.

We started with a Wednesday evening walking food tour of the Old Quarter. Our guide Hien (who also goes by Cherry) was an absolute delight! From the smiley faces on her shoes to her stellar attitude to her extensive knowledge of the city and its cuisine, we couldn't have asked for a better introduction to Hanoi. We started off with the best Bun Cha (pork and meatbal noodle soup) I've ever had, and wound our way through Vietnamese cuisine from the tame (a yogurt, black rice and fruit dessert) to the more adventurous (I don't remember what it was called, but there was definitely an eel involved). Hien was careful to check with everyone in the group for food intolerances and preferences to make sure she chose restaurants we could all enjoy. She tirelessly guided us through rainy, crowded streets from place to place, making sure we were getting everything we needed (and more!). She even stopped to get us all ponchos so that we could continue to enjoy our evening despite the weather. We had such a great time on Wednesday night that we emailed the company to see if she was available for a tour of the city on Friday. Much to our delight, she was! They were so accommodating and even arranged a van so our group could comfortably see as many sights as possible. We saw temples, museums, beautiful gardens, and (of course) more food! Hien had us figured out as foodies and made a point of finding us delicious snacks, and an incredible \"modern pho\" lunch. I absolutely wouldn't have traded our experience for anything else. Hien was a delight, and I would recommend her with no reservations whatsoever. I hope to return again next year to attend the same conference again, and plan to email ahead of time for more tours with her. I highly recommend you do the same. And when she yells \"STICKY RICE!\" as a cue to stick together and cross the street quickly, you'd better listen. Hien will make sure you're full, and that you don't get plastered by a moped!"

They easily understood and when meats were the specialty, provided him with an alternate, equally delicious, dish.We went to 7 unique locations, each offering a specialty dish.

I can't speak highly enough of this tour; we ate amazing food that we would never have dreamed of stopping for. All up I think we had about 12 'courses' each one as good as the last. I was surprised to enjoy some of them, the egg coffee for example is something I would never have tried on my own but it was delicious. I'd highly recommend a private tour as you are not waiting for 12 other people, have the full attention of your guide and don't have to worry about different food allergies etc. Miss Moon, we will remember to stick together like 'sticky rice' to keep ourselves safe when crossing the road!! Thank you again for an amazing time."

A local guy took us from \"restaurant\" to \"restaurant\" (it's basically a kitchen on the corner with small plastic chairs) and we got to taste all kinds of local food. Amazing experience, the guide was super cool, and all food and drinks are included in the price! Also, none of us got sick from the food, so don't worry, it's safe."

Great to do on arrival, as we did.Pixie picked us up at our hotel and took us by car to the Old Quarter. There we started our walk through the Quarter - so we also had a lesson in how to navigate the streets and crazy traffic. Pixie had selected a variety of different foods for us to try and I must admit there were many places we would never had entered on our own, where we experienced the most interesting and delicious new tastes.Definitely led to us trying many new dishes on the rest of our journey.Recommend a private tour or very small group as easier to keep together on busy streets, and to hear guides stories.Thanks Pixie, loved your tour, you were great!"

Kiwi did a great job of explaining each of the dishes we tried and their ingredients. We were definitely stuffed by the end of the tour and each of the dishes were delicious. It's a great introduction to Hanoi as well as Vietnamese food and even though we'd been traveling the country for about a month already and didn't need an intro per se, we still had a great night and would do it again in a heartbeat!One thing to note is that if you're looking to eat 'weird' foods, you won't really find them on this tour, which seemed to be absolutely fine for the majority of our group!"

We had a wonderful time being led around by Annie to taste some amazing food and drinks throughout the old quarter. Annie was very well spoken and had an extensive knowledge of the area and food. It was nice meeting people in our group as we had all very diverse backgrounds. I highly suggest that you take the time to do this tour as early in the trip as possible. Thank you Annie for making this night so much fun."

Our guide Donut (she loves that food that's why you can call her like that) was sooo friendly and caring. She took us to wonderful places where I would probably have never went without her and we tried very delicious food ! I now know that I love papaya salad. <3 she was also very helpful and answered all our questions about Vietnam/Hanoi/ food/religion- everything ! If you asked her about a special food she tried to arrange it. I asked her if there is a special wine in Vietnam and we had rice wine during the tour. The only mistake we did was doing the tour at the end of our Hanoi stay. I would love to go back to some places and have the food again. So go there on your first evening- it's the best way to explore the old quarter and start with Vietnamese food."

We were prepared to pay USD20 for the chance to try street food costing a fraction of the price of the tour just so we could get to eat in places tourists would normally not go to. In this respect the tour partially delivered. Our first stop was a midpriced restaurant for one particular dish, and we also had another stop at a modern ice-cream outlet at the lake, but we did have chances to sit down at the roadside for dessert and enter hole-in the wall restaurants we would never have visited on our own. Our guide Pixie spoke good English and was cheerful and accommodating. She halted traffic for us when crossing the ridiculously busy streets. It would have been nice to have more narrative of the areas we were walking through, as well as more information on the ingredients and and history of what we were eating. We did get a commentary on the lake and the recently demised revered turtle that lived there.Felt I could have eaten a bit more afterwords.

If you find yourself in Hanoi at any time of year, and you don't end up doing this tour, you are seriously missing out on the actual best thing this city can offer for anybody touring through it. You get a real taste of all things Vietnamese here and everything you eat is absolutely delicious! We returned the day before from Halong Bay in a rather disappointed state with what we experienced there, so doing this surely made up for any downfalls on the trip that we had.The guides all speak English fairly well and the cost of the whole thing is pittance compared to the value you receive for it. The most exciting part of all of this is the food of course, but the fact that you get to see the old quarter of Hanoi in all its glory. The smells of pork cooking over charcoal that waft through the busy streets takes you on a sensory journey like no other. It's a smell that I will never forget and makes me long to go back there and do it all again. You visit markets, dodge busy traffic while being told that \"sticky rice\" is the call you make when you huddle together to cross the roads or walk through an intersection. Don't worry about getting hit by a moving vehicle, they actually dodge you! It's pretty awesome to do that. Just remember, whatever you do, don't stop walking when you cross the road, or you may just wind up getting struck by a motorbike or worse still, a car.The end of the tour finishes with some desserts and a stop at a pub for a nice cold beer. I found that over the three hours of this, I felt so full that I didn't really need to eat for the rest of the day. I arrived hungry, left extremely full. Just how it should be. If you really want to experience the true culture of a city and the nature of its people, try the local food. It gives you a story that you just can't get with words.I place this tour here as hands down, the BEST thing one can do whilst in Vietnam."

The tour provided a perfect introduction to the Old Quarter of Hanoi as well as some great and varied local food. Our guide Nga, was fantastic. She was hugely knowledgeable about the cuisine, local environment and history and heritage of Hanoi. She was great fun, entertaining and really enthusiastic. We visited vendors and tried food that we would easily have by-passed had we not been on this tour. A real experience and excellent value. This tour totally lived up to its billing and fully deserves to be so highly rated."

At the beginning of the tour she asked us if we had anything we really wanted to eat and if there was anything we didn't like or were allergic to.We started with Bun Cha (grilled pork balls with noodles), pork balls had a wonderful smoky flavour imparted by being grilled over charcoal. 2) Kem Chanh (Rice ice cream) at Hoan Kiem Lake3) Banh cuon thit ( steamed rice rolls) delicious and we had the opportunity to take the rice wrappers off the steamer which was a fun addition.4) Banh goi (pillow cake), Nem cua be (spring rolls), Nem Chau ran (sour pork rolls), Banh ran ngot (sticky rice fried bun). A wonderful selection of tastes and textures.5) Sua chua hoa qua nep cam (che dessert) a wonderful combination of fruit, black rice porridge, sweetened condensed milk and yoghurt6) Egg coffee and Bahn Mi(pork in a baguette). A wonderful way to round out the tour.Duong was extremely informative, not just about the street food, but also the history of the Old Quarter, origins of food and culture of Vietnam. Her English was excellent and she assisted us with our Vietnamese pronunciation. Duong is a friendly cheerful woman.At the end of the tour Duong wrote out a list of what we had eastern and where we had eaten it, along with a list of recommendations for us for the rest of our stay in Hanoi.You will visit places that unless you are local you Will Not Find. Beware that there are imitators of Hanoi Street Food Tour, make sure you go to the right address (look for Kim tours)"

I have done food tours and cooking classes which have been very good - this street food tour raised the bar, it exceeded my expectations and that was after reading the TA reviews! Miss Moon is a true foodie, has excellent communication skills, a wonderful sense of humour, is knowledgeable (she has travelled extensively thru Vietnam) and cares about your enjoyment of the food. Miss Moon will give advice on scams, crossing roads and show you the food certificates to look for.Cost for 2.5 to 3 hour street food tour is $20 USD but you can pay in Dong if you wish. We turned up 10:40 and jumped on 11am tour no problems. There were only 3 of us and no food restrictions which opened up all the food choices. I highly recommend prepping your food baby (which means stomach) by not having breakfast. The food you are about to experience will be plentiful and so tasty from long term locals who specialise in their dish.In all we tried 11 items as we had no dietary restrictions. Our food babies were so satisfied! It is hard to pick but if pushed my top 3 would be BBQ Pork with Noodles, Pancake with Pork and the Egg Coffee. Special note for the egg coffee which is just superb, velvety, rich and tiramisu like in flavour and texture. It is not just a whole egg yolk in hot instant coffee as I thought beforehand. It is a chicken egg yolk with honey and sugar blended until frothy poured into extremely hot coffee. If you don't drink coffee they can make a Egg Hot Chocolate for you which tastes like rich creamy chocolate custard. I highly recommend it for anyone in Hanoi. It will make your food baby very happy."

I did the lunch tour, I would recommend going on a tour as soon as you arrive as you are told about the hustles and scams along with being shown secret seating areas and accompanying condiments that you would not know to ask for and are not offered. This was a great tour and well worth the $20 for the hour plus, stomach filling, walking tour of the old quarter. My only wish was that they did a \"Adventurous\" street food tour... something more Andrew Zimmern style."

I am always a little reluctant to jump straight on to an organised tour (I did this in Morocco so am now wary of guides taking you to places to get kickbacks instead of good places), but after my sister convinced us that this tour was rated number 1 on tripadvisor, we all agreed to go. This tour does not disappoint! It was 465,000 dong (about USD$20-25), and we ate and drank soooo much! The food was incredible! Our guide Miss Moon was funny enthusiastic, and genuine. She warned us that locals don't eat from street cart vendors (like the banana ladies) because they don't know where the food has come from, and promised to take us to trusted, tasty and great local places. She didn't disappoint! The most incredible thing I had that night was the corn paper filled with fresh coconut, fried sugar cane and black sesame; I'm still having day dreams about it! This was one was by fluke though; Miss Moon took us to the usual places, but happened to see this little man with the delicious corn papers peddling his little bike cart down the street (it has bobia written on the side), so ran him down for us. So glad we did this tour on the first night in Hanoi, not only did we learn so much about the food and drink, but we also learnt how to cross the road (sticky rice!) and got tips of tourist scams to be wary of. Thank you so much Miss Moon for such a wonderful experience! Great foodie thing to do in Hanoi."

Our guide was Cherry and she was young and cheerful but she managed to make the tour very engaging, fun and interesting, explaining many cultural aspects of the life in Hanoi. I thought that food portions would be small, but believe me, by the end of the tour you cannot possibly eat more, and I have a big appetite. We tried 7 to 9 different dishes and drinks, including soup, spring rolls, donuts, beer, beer food, dessert, salads, rice cakes, etc. All the places we visited were 100% local and authentic.

At first I thought $20 was quite expensive but it was definitely worth the money. We got some history of different things around the town and mango answered any questions we had. The portions are not huge but you eat a lot so it's more than enough. By the end I was so full I could hardly move. This tour is definitely worth doing if you are in Hanoi!"

No need to pre book as you can just show up about 15 minutes before one of the times that the tours go. We were put together with others to make a group of 8 and introduced to our guide Sunny. She was very informative and safely navigated our way as we walked through the crazy streets of old quarter. I lost count but we went to at least 6 different street food vendors, often tucked away up narrow staircases or in the back of a shop. We had a variety of different Vietnamese foods including salad, buns, soup, dessert, egg coffee, beer (or alternate for those who don't drink alcohol). The food was very filling and this was a fun way to spend a few hours with others trying out different foods."

My main purpose in Vietnam has been to EAT, so I have done far too much research in order to eat every possible thing on my list. This tour covered nine or ten of those options in one evening and also helped me feel more confident braving the street food scene by myself. This tour and Cherry set me up for an incredible trip to Vietnam, so do yourself a favor and book it!!!"

All the dishes were great (total of 7) and our guide, Kiwi, was lovely and really informative and definitely knew where the best places were. You should definitely go on an empty stomach as you will be stuffed after the tour as the portion sizes they give you is really generous. It was also nice being guided through the chaotic streets with someone who knows their way around and was always concerned for our safety whilst crossing the roads. A really great introduction to the amazing food here and to some great restaurants that we will be visiting again during our stay in Hanoi."

Right from the bun cha, Vietnamese spring noodles , raw papaya salad to the egg coffee every street food outlet was picked with care and quality of food was really authentic and good. Please be informed that it is a typical street food tour and in some of the places you are seated almost on the street on small stools. That's the whole fun of it. Also many of them are not super clean if you are finicky about cleanliness. Our guide was Ms.Cherry who was very enthusiastic and made the tour really enjoyable.

More spontaneous than anything else I ended up joining a recently made friend for the 3,5 hours street food tour in the old part of Hanoi. Every minute of the tour and every bite of the different traditional local snacks we tried in more than a handful little street restaurants/stalls were sooo worthwhile! Our passionate and lovely guide \"Money\" provided us with excellent and valuable explanations about the local food culture and the snacks we had and chose thoroughly from the many places to give us the most authentic and varied experience possible.

Before I write anything else I have to mention our guide Mango who was amazing. She was so bubbly and bright and really loved showing off Hanoi to us. She on her own would be a 5* rating.The 'food' provided on the the tour was a bit of a joke portion wise. My wife doesn't eat much generally and even she came away dissatisfied. Out of the 10 foods you try one is an ice lolly, one is a beer, and one is a lemon tea. When you do get food they are simply just small snacks and we found it tough to work out where our 40$ had been spent. Some places we want to it felt like we were more killing time than on a tour. Such as visiting a closed temple, a photoshoot outside the cathedral and eating sunflower seeds in the lemon tea shop, which most people were eating to get some food in themselves!In general it's a good tour if you want to get your bearings, meet new people and have a very small taste of Northern Vietnamese food. To be honest though I would just do a walking tour less the food, and then save the extra to jump in to places yourself, after all it's rare that you can go wrong with street food in Vietnam. Just get a list of the local delicacies and go seek them out.It wasn't what we expected and we felt the price was a little too strong for what it was, 10 - 15$ would have been more like it."

Our group of three couples who met her and each other for the first time felt we entirely lucked out to have Ms. Moon as our guide. One note: If you do the arithmetic, at $20 per head for three hours which has to cover food and the margin to the company, the guides can't be earning a lot in exchange for giving us a delightful introduction to Hanoi's food culture.

For a first timer, the streets are confusing, of course, but when we got there, they are more than willing to be of service to us. We choose the street food tour. To our luck, we got the very energetic, lovely, knowledgeable and lively Miss Pixie together with Ms. Jao (a trainee), also as lovely as Pixie, as our tour guide. Aren't we lucky, we got two! :) They took us to different restaurants and gave us the information of what we are eating, how to eat, when is it eaten, ingredients, and sometime on how it is cooked. We ate like the locals, sitting in small chair, holding that chopsticks and enjoying their cuisine. We walked and ate and walk and ate. Not only to food, both of them gave us a peak on their history and their culture. Pixie was very attentive. She's the one serving us the food while explaining, and answered all of our questions. At the end of the tour, all of us are very happy with a big smiling tummy! :) And Pixie wrote on a piece of paper, which I still have, the food that we ate and the address of each place and it came really handy and useful since we came back in the Old Quarter to shop and eat! Then they walked with us to our taxi and gave instructions to them on where to go. Hugs of goodbyes!It was our first Food tour ever and I was really impressed. It is such a great tour since this will be a window to the Vietnam culture. It would be really great if you take this tour. I love the Vietnam dish! and will prolly come back for more! Thank you so much for the two girls who assisted us! :) We love you already!"

The tour itself also shows you a bit of the city - and there are some places that you visit that you would've simply walked past had you not known how good the food was! The Bun Cha and the Papya salad were highlights for me - but everything was good - and you have the option of trying some of the more unusual foods if you want.

At the beginning, the servings seemed so tiny but it's actually to save space.One tip I have for you is to take a picture of the dish with the name written on a napkin beside it. That way you can always go and have more another time! If you can, also mark down the locations of each place on a map. The egg coffee place was particularly obscure so if you want to go back, make sure to take notes!Our tour was a group of six plus our guide. Our guide, I can't remember her name, but she was really sweet and made the whole experience so much fun. I think her name begins with an \"m\", she had glasses and bangs.This is only the beginning of food tours! I could not recommend this tour more. Such a wonderful experience and well worth the money!"

She has a genuine passion for her city and the incredible array of food it offers. Every stop was organised, on point, with almost no waiting time at each stop - just straight to the eating.If the Birj Kalifa in Dubai is the world's only six star hotel, then Hanoi Street Food Tour is Hanoi's six star tour experience.Thank you Money for your kindness and memories on Christmas Eve 2015."

Ms. Moon is a gem - she brings a passion for food and the culture of Hanoi, plus a great sense of humor and fun to the tour. We were lucky to have a small group four our Street Food tour (8), leaving at 11:00 am. She happily accommodated my partner's vegetarianism and my own preferences (no red meat). Stopping at 10 different locations, we were so full, we never even considered eating dinner that night. Everything we tried was great, and we would not have experienced any of them without the tour. Even if we had found the locations on our own, we would not have known what/how to order. She had interesting tidbits to share about everything we ate, from where the dish originated to nutritional properties.After two weeks in Vietnam and Cambodia, this tour definitely stands out as a highlight and I absolutely recommend, especially if you can get Ms. Moon.

The tour stopped at about 8 places, and we sampled noodle dishes, desserts, fresh beer (bia hoy), rice dishes of every kind, and finished with a delicious, locally famous coffee. We had a truly great evening, and learned so much about the food in Hanoi. In the days afterwards, we returned to many of the places we discovered that night."

The food was delicious and again, we wouldn't have tried it if not for Mango and the tour. Bun Cha is just delicious! Good value as the cost includes all your food and some water. Don't hesitate to join one of these tours."

She started with a street place that made sticky rice cakes & told us to stay together like sticky rice when following her down small streets & alleys. Each place we stopped for a new plate, she explained the ingredients & how long the vendor had been there. We were totally stuffed with delicious food, beer & egg coffee by the time we finished 3.5hrs later. We sampled 10 dishes (yum) & all were sumptuous.Thank you Miss Moon you were a breath of fresh air with a delightful sense of humour."

We followed their advice and requested Ms. Moon but when we arrived were matched with Mango. We loved Mango and she did a great job leading our tour. Mango took us around to 8 establishments to try 11 foods, snacks and drinks. I was worried we would be way too stuffed to try all the food, but each stop doesn't involve an entire meal. 9 out of the 11 things we tried were brand new to us and most likely we wouldn't have ever tried them without the tour. Every single one was good, and some were great! Our favorite was the dingy hole-in-the-wall where we got to make our own rice pancakes that were wrapped around fried pork and mushrooms and dipped in a light sauce (called Banh cuon). In addition to trying great food, we got a different look of the city as we walked through back alleys and around hidden corners in Old Quarter Hanoi. Mango did a great job stopping throughout the tour and explaining the historical and cultural significance of different aspects of the city. At the end of the tour, Mango wrote down the names and addresses of all the places we went and gave us tips for the rest of our time in Hanoi. When I look back on our trip to Hanoi, this stands out as my favorite part (partially for the food, partially for the view of the city, and partially for our great tour guide). It was pricier than we were anticipating ($30 USD per person for the private tour), but it was worth it. The private tour seemed like the way to go because many places we went were tiny spaces, and in a large group you could be crowded out or pushed to the back. If you go, request Mango!"

We were not disappointed, as the locations we travelled were actually some distance away!We went with a group of 5 friends and as soon as we were introduced to Nga, we knew we were in for a good night.We then hopped onto a scooter driven by a friendly local, most of them students or doing this on top of studying/working other jobs and were taken to several locations to experience street food all around Hanoi. We also stopped off at several locations and learnt about the history and culture of each part.Getting to each destination was half the fun and not even the rain could quell our excitement, in fact it just added to the whole experience. In addition, they do offer pickup and drop off to your hotel, so travel isn't an issue. All in all, one of the best experiences we've had during our time in Vietnam!"

We were fortunate that it was not busy when we went. We were able to walk up and secure a place in line. We paid $20 US. This is a three hour tour. You will have a place or two or three to go to the bathroom if you need to. It might be wise to take some toilet paper if you think you might even remotely needed it. If you are a little finicky you might bring along your own chopsticks or a sanitizing cloth to wipe the ones provided by the restaurants. However we used the provided chopsticks at every restaurant and had no side effects. You will have to cross the street multiple times. You will be provided beer at several locations. The price is all inclusive. Pheonix did such a great job we wanted to tip her. We had 8 stops. They will adjust the restaurant locations if you have food allergies or concerns. It was the highlight of day and not only provided the where of good food but the cultural experience of the old quarter. We would have paid $20 just to learn about everyday life in the old quarter. We recommend the 1830 tour because you get to watch the after work environment evolve. Parents taking kids home, people stopping for dinner,then all the young natives and expats heading out for the nightlife. We managed to pass the beer corner twice and the crowd was amazing. Do this!"

Very reasonably priced ~$20 USD lasting about 3+hours in a max group of 10 people which is perfect. You walk a bit which helps deal with the amount of food offered.

Yes, Mango is her name and she led a private tour for my boyfriend and me as Hanoi Street Food didn\u2019t have any spots left in their regular tour. For an extra $5 ($30 per person), this was money well spent. As we traversed the congested streets of the Old Quarter, Mango would yell \u201csticky rice\u201d to remind us to stick closer together, and we continued to use this throughout our time in Hanoi!We tasted 13 foods from 8 places on this 2.5 hour walking tour with Mango, and between all the history, information and trivia she shared, we had a blast. Here are some of the tasty treats we had:--Bun Cha: rice noodles with BBQ pork in fish sauce with sugar--Kem Chanh: refreshing lemon mint ice cream popsicles--Bang Cuon: we tried our hand rolling these rice pancakes on what looked like a crepe maker, using a wooden mallet to slide under the pancake. We then sampled the rice pancakes, which were stuffed with pork and mushrooms, and sprinkled on top with fried onions, then dipped in the fish sauce with herbs.--Bo Bia: a light, sweet crepe snack filled with dried coconut, black sesame and honeycomb (a student's snack as she called it, because you can take it with you on the go very easily)--Nem and Banh (dumplings and spring rolls): we had four types here, the fermented pork roll, pillow cake (which had pork, mushrooms and glass noodles), the crab spring roll (deep fried imperial roll) and the sweet donut (which had green bean inside it)--Bia Ho: fresh Vietnamese beer--Ruou Gao: banana rice wine (30% alcohol content)--Banh My: Vietnamese sandwich--Ca Phe Teung (egg coffee): the egg on top was like dessert, but it all finished off like a proper coffee once it was all mixed up. Don\u2019t hesitate to book this tour early on in your stay in Hanoi, as you\u2019ll want to visit and re-visit some of these hole-in-the-wall joints again!

It was a private (2 couples) tour of local street food, for not much more money than the group tour. We visited 8 locations (all within walking distance) over 3+ hours, and had about 13 different kinds of food. Cherry was our amazing guide - she was bubbly, informative, and solicitous."

She was so charming and made the tour so much fun, providing also great insights into the Vietnamese culture and showing us around the city in the process. My only comment would be on the food as we seemed to have experienced better eats for similar dishes in other spots during our stay in Hanoi. But I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to learn about the street food and culture of this great town."

For the next 3+ hours she showed us around the area and introduced us to many delectable treats,including Bun cha, Banh cuon thit and Egg chocolate. She was a delightful guide and we enjoyed not only the food but some wonderful conversation and explanation of the area and other things about Hanoi and Vietnam.

My wife and I booked the tour in October 2015 and I would rate the experience we had as 5 stars out of 5. The cost was only $20 per person (\u00a314), and this was great value for money. As not only did we eat a lot of lovely food on the tour (8 different courses, if you include the drinks too) but our guide on the evening, \u201cKiwi\u201d, was fantastic too. She was so friendly, smiled all of the time, took time out to help everyone on the tour, and was very informative too (\u201cKiwi\u201d was very knowledgeable). If you had any questions \u201cKiwi\u201d the guide was more than happy to help. Thank you \u201cKiwi\u201d for being such a great guide. Another good thing was that \u201cKiwi\u201d never \u201cclock watched\u201d and the tour did not last the expected 3 hours, but actually over-ran to nearly 3 \u00be hours. Meaning the guide \u201cKiwi\u201d did not rush, and was very customer focused.I would say that it would be better to do this tour at the beginning of your stay in Hanoi, as it will allow you to get to know your way around the Old Quarter early on, in the first few days of your stay. As you do cover off a lot of ground on foot, meaning it will help you find your way around the OId Quarter for the rest of your stay.What can I say about the food. Wow fantastic. It all tasted lovely, and at the end of the tour I was stuffed. There was such a diverse range of different food types also.We ate \u201cBun Cha\u201d (Noodle with grilled Pork), \u201cNam Bo\u201d (Green Papaya salad), \u201cBanh Cuon Thit\u201d (Fresh Rice noodle rolls), \u201cNem\u201d (We tried 3 different versions of Fried Spring roll), \u201cBun Rieu\u201d (Noodles with Crab), \u201cHoa Qua Dam\u201d (mixed fruit salad), \u201cBia Hoi\u201d (locally produced beer), \u201cBanh My (Vietnamese sandwich), lastly \u201cCaf\u00e9 Tray\u201d (Egg Coffee).All the food was fantastic.So overall I would suggest booking this tour, as it was one of the highlights of our holiday. Thumbs up to the great guide \u201cKiwi\u201d also."

I joined the tour with very little expectations, esp when I've just arrived a day ago and all I can think of are all the glorious food Hanoi has to offer. I read so many reviews and Hanoi street food tour was the most recommended and I can see why. Our guide, Moon, was bubbly and animated. She's very smiley and adorable! Her guide was informative and relaxed. We tried about 10 dishes and my favorite was this street dessert (made out of corn pancake, fried sugar cane, shredded coconut and black sesame) made by a deaf phantom seller. Why phantom? According to Moon, it's hard to spot him on the streets, we were lucky that day to bump into him! I'd recommend the tour to anybody! It will be the best 20 USD you'll ever spend at Hanoi. It might seem pricey at first but when you know what you're getting in return, you know you got a really great deal. It was a lovely late morning with Moon and a bunch of other travelers. Through this experience I made new friends, ate my fill and brought home a little knowledge about Hanoi."

I tried a few food tours throughout Vietnam and Thailand and would have to say that this was the best bang for my buck at $20 USD per head (the other street food tours were good too - just 40-50% more expensive). We stopped by 7 establishments and tried out 11 different dishes if I'm not mistaken. Pixie was an enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide that also provided some historical context at a couple of places in-between the food tour stops. At the end of the tour (and to our delight), she provided a hand-written list of the places we went to and also wrote down a few more recommendations for places that we didn't try on the tour. All-in-all, I thought $20 USD was well spent to try places that I wouldn't have known to go to myself. An added bonus is that the walking tour is also a decent way to meet other solo travelers, depending on the composition of your group. I grabbed beers with two other people (now friends) from the group after the tour concluded as we were close to the sprawling beer corner.My favorites from the tour were Bun Cha (grilled pork meatballs with noodles), Ban Cuon Thit (steamed rice rolls), and the egg coffee at the end. Some additional tips:- You do cross a few busy streets in the Old Quarter so be prepared if this is your first stop in Hanoi!- This probably goes without saying, but try not to eat beforehand. - Be careful of other operators posing as this street food tour, but just follow the instructions on the website and you'll be fine."

We booked a private tour so we could go over lunchtime. Was $30 to go on our own, we requested Nga (Ms. Money) and she was as good as advertised. Just fantastic -- smart, knows her stuff, speaks great English and gives a great tour. A home run and a great idea, particularly for folks new to Hanoi. A great exploration of a ton of types of Hanoi street food. Loved it."

Pixie was great and showed us everything and really showed us what it was like to eat like a true Vietnamise person. She was able to tend to our dietary restrictions and was great with our 5 kids. I would definitely reccomed this tour if you go to Hanoi, and if its possible try and ask for Pixie. She also brought us into places that we would not have ever entered if we did not decide to sign up for the tour.... And it tasted REALLY good!"

Daniel runs a restaurant business in Hanoi, and starts the tour taking you to the local markets where he would buy food - and you definitely get to see a Vietnam that the ordinary tourist would never see - fascinating. A leisurely drive and walk around parts of Hanoi that are a must-see if you want to really experience the place, the walk ended at a deightful locals bar for a drink, with street food brought in from the vendor next door! Only in Vietnam! Eating the food, and a talk through the herbs and spices included, was fascinating. A truly worthwhile experience to get to feel the real Hanoi."

Vietnam has an eclectic cuisine and this tour is a great way to try it. Our tour guide , Phuong ( Phoenix) was bubbly, enthusiastic and made this tour more than worthwhile. This tour manages to strike an excellent balance of variety and quantity while including all courses of a meal. I would nevertheless recommend that one prepares themselves for a big meal if you want to try all dishes. We counted 8 different restaurants/ eateries that we visited and one of them also allowed us to try making one their rice - crepe dumplings.The price of the tour is a bit on the higher side if you just add up the cost of the dishes we tried, but I don't believe I would have tried all these dishes without the guide. No one fell sick despite the general appearance of the establishments we visited. The tour definitely has chosen establishments with clean cooking practices. Vegetarians and special diets are also accommodated in this tour. This was not only a great way to taste different Vietnamese food but also a good way to spend an evening walking around the old quarter. STICKY RICE!!!"

They did push the tour back half an hour or so after we arrived and also tried to tell us that it was more than the advertised price ($25usd instead of $20usd) but without much trouble we stuck with the less expensive price.The food was delicious and all freshly made which meant at times there was a little waiting around but cheap local beer helped with that issue!Also touring with like minded people is always interesting and we had a friendly bunch with us. My favourite dish was the paw paw and pork salad - yum! You will eat a lot of food on this tour so I would suggest not eating lunch that day or you won't fit it in, luckily we had done just that.We took our 9 and 13 year olds with us and while it was a late night and they were tired by the end they handled it well and were entertained listening to all the different accents and conversations in our group.My only tip is that if you are a clean freak or germ-a-phobe this may not be the tour for you. It is very much street food but having said that most of the places we visited could have done with a good clean, dirty tissues and scraps strewn everywhere and tables not wiped down. If you are going to go, try to not look and just enjoy the food. Also if you have bad knees or back, sitting on the tiny chairs may be a problem."

We walked up to the office without a reservation, requested a private walking tour for 4 people and they said they could accommodate us in 30 minutes, which was perfect. Annie, our guide, was spectacular, sweet, friendly, and her English was superb. We liked her so much, we wanted to bring her with us to Ho Chi Minh city later in the week so she could guide us there, too! Thank you for a great tour, Annie! The food was delicious and the locations were places we never would have thought to visit ourselves without a guide. Not a single location disappointed. We each had our favorites, but in general this tour has been the highlight of our visit that we keep telling other people about. We would recommend this tour and our guide to anyone in a heartbeat. Annie was also very conscious about asking if we had any food allergies or aversions or restrictions before we started the tour. Very considerate and at 25 US dollars per person (with a group of 4) it was a great value. (Walking the beautiful and intriguing Old quarter was also a great way to get to know that part of the city.)Highly recommended to anyone as a great intro to the city and its cuisine!(At the end of the tour, Annie also wrote out a list of everything we had eaten, as well as a few other recommendations as to where to go for food items we did not yet have in this particular tour. We went to the Pho place she recommended that night and loved that, too! Thanks again, Annie!)"

Miss Moon gave us some background on the foods we ate, explained the seasonings, and showed us how to use them. (She also gave us some insights into the Vietnamese culture.) Miss Moon gave us an invaluable lesson in how to get across the crazy-busy streets, many with no traffic light. We used this for the rest of our stay.

The food was decent in terms of taste and the variety was good, but the egg coffee wasn't good in my opinion. If you've already had a few meals in Hanoi, you should let the guide know in advance so they won't bring you to try food that you've already eaten.Overall, excellent location and good variety of food, but the taste of the food was not fantastic.Lastly, one point to note is to NOT take other tours from the office as they are outsourced. If you do, it'd be best to find out exactly what the tour is about. My friends and I signed up for the tour to ha long bay and we didn't get what we expected."

But we were wrong! There was so much food! I even didn't get to eat my Banh Mi as I was too full at that point! Definitely liked (hope I get these correct) Bum Bo Nam Bo, Bo Bia, Bun Cha, Egg Coffee and my personal favorite, the different kind of spring rolls!Nguyen Thu Hien (or Cherry) was excellent. She took care of the group well and she gave us usable information (how to cross the streets, the food we were eating, some sights in the Old Quarter). Sticky rice! :)Also, we were in a good group. Everyone was willing to try the different kinds of food and game to walk around the area. We definitely had a blast with our group.As a suggestion for improvement - maybe provide water at the 1st stop and the halfway point. Some of us were asking for water from the 1st stop, but we were told to wait for the water on the next stop. Also by the halfway point, we didn't have water anymore.Overall, great experience. I will definitely recommend this to friends! Best to try this on the 1st day!"

She was adorable, knowledgable and very pleasant to spend the 5 hours of the tour with. She knew all the great restaurants and street food stalls so we had a variety of tastes to sample. We got some interesting facts and history lessons about the people and culture of Vietnam and an amazing array of local fare from about 9 different stops on the tour. Our favorite was the Bun bo nam bo. We liked it so much, we went back the next day. We would have never gone there had it not been for the tour.

You will have more food than you can possibly eat, so you should definitely skip lunch in anticipation of this walking food tour. Drinks were included, and a few of the stops had restrooms. Our only glitch (which did not end up mattering) was that we had booked a private tour but ended up on a group tour. However, the others in our group were a pleasure to be around, so it worked out fine. I would highly recommend this tour as a way to get an introduction to delicious food and drinks in Hanoi.

The only item we were a bit disappointed by was the banh mi - but it was accompanied by egg coffee that was incredible, so I think they just picked the place for the coffee. Not to mention by that point we were so full that everything was going to taste a bit different. Everything else? Amazing. Very local, you'll eat in places you might have never walked into on your own, and as I said - everything will be top notch quality. Also - if you are trying to choose between the scooter and walking - go with the scooter! It was SO much fun. It's definitely the way to see Hanoi and make it feel like a truly local experience. Lily and Mia were great drivers (I was glad that I wasn't driving!) and it was a really, really nice change of pace from challenge of navigating the streets on foot.

We weren't able to be picked up at our original location but it was no problem as Money got us on her motorbike and took us to the original starting location. It was such an authentic experience as we went into restaurants that you would never know was a eatery from the outside. You knew you were truly eating where and what the locals do. Just when we thought the food could not be more delicious, every stop got better and better.Money was great because she not only answered questions about the food but also was happy to explain culture, nuances of the city, history, ect. There was no language barrier, and she was super personal and genuinely happy to be giving a tour!She even wrote down everything we had, what addresses we had them at, and where she would suggest we should go if we wanted to continue our culinary explorations. We could not be more happy with our decision to go!!"

However at no point on the tour I was looking at the time. There was a group of 8, our tour guide was Kiwi, she was fantastic, great English, very attentive to everyone's needs, there was a pregnant woman who was avoiding shellfish Kiwi was quick to inform the local places we visits to get an alternative dish.When crossing the busy streets in Hanoi Kiwi would shout STICKY RICE, for everyone to group together an cross safely, not only I found this hilarious but also brilliant she was continuously looking after everyone.Surprisingly not a lot of the dishes we had were fishy, although most of them contained fish sauce only 1 or 2 things actually contained seafood. I don't eat much seafood at home and was full of fish from the week before so it was a welcomed break from seafood.Highly recommend this tour and ask for Kiwi to take you, she was great."

She knew all about the food of her nation and where to get the best. There are no five star restaurants on this tour, prepare to get down and dirty with the locals. But it is worth every penny (which at $25 per head really amounts to nothing). We were so full by the end, there wasn't room to stop at Beer Junction for a refreshing cold one. A brilliant way to spend 3 hours in Hanoi. Can't recommend it enough. Thank you Hien Cherry for making the tour so fun and memorable!!!"

Due to the very limited time we stayed at Hanoi, we wanted to make the most out of it and chose to do the Hanoi Street Food Tour, which was rated #1 on Tripadvisor, to get a good impression of the Hanoi street food scene. We chose the 3 hrs night tour and my personal opinion is: it totally deserves its status as the best street food tour in Hanoi!Our guide, Phoenix, was a very warm and friendly person, who was really enthusiastic about the places and food she showed us and did not only take well care of our group (\"sticky rice\") the whole time, but also made this a quite inside experience, as she showed as how to eat and enjoy the dishes and explained about their ingredients and preparation.She brought us to a lot of places, we would have probably not tried or even not found as they are very small and hidden but nonetheless very tasty and authentic! In one place we could even try to make the thin rice paper layers by ourselves. We also were with a very nice and funny group with a good group size of 6 persons, so we had interesting discussions the entire evening. The evening ended with some Bia Hoi and Egg Coffee and our guide even stayed with us a little longer until 10.30pm so we had the feeling she really enjoyed the tour as well and was not pushy at all about the time we would need to get back.We definitely recommend the tour to everyone who is really into experiencing local and delicious Vietnamese food and wants to a add a great experience with a local guide who can tell you a lot of interesting and funny stories as well. Perfect evening!! Thank you Phoenix!"

Yes, it really is as awesome as we all make it out to be. Why it's amazing: 1) Customer service. It's everything. Our guides Mia, Lily, and Moon were on-time, fluent in English, friendly, and very attentive to our needs. In fact, when one of us accidentally left our bag (with TWO of our passports) at the last stop after we had gotten dropped off for the day, we called in a panic back to the company and within minutes, our tour guides had brought our bag back to us, and with a big smile as usual. This was just beyond what we expected and asked for in a company and put the cherry on top of an already great day.2) Fun! Riding on the scooter is definitely the best way to explore Hanoi. You could not pay me enough money to drive it myself, but I trusted those guides 100%. They were ridiculously good scooter drivers all while checking in every few minutes to make sure that we felt safe. During the trip, we went down narrow back alleys, past historical landmarks like the oldest bridge in Hanoi, and through other neighborhoods that showed us a slice of Vietnamese life.3) Delicious. We had 8-10 different types of food during the tour, most of which we had not heard of before. So delicious. I'm still thinking of the food right now salivating. In fact the food was so good that we continued to order it for every meal for the rest of the trip rather than getting Western food.Overall, this company was wonderful and the experience made me want to stay in Vietnam longer. The things I learned, not only about food, but about history and culture, made me appreciate Vietnam on a deeper level. Thank you Mia, Lily, and Moon for the spectacular day, we are still talking about it! Hint: Do not eat before your tour if it's an afternoon tour. You will be so full from all the food!"

Our favourite was the Bo Bia which I can best describe as a coconut and sugarcane pancake which hit the spot and we visited the vendor a couple more times during our trip to get our sugar hit.

We had an awesome tour with our guide Nga also known as \"Money\". She knew her facts and yummy food. It was very enjoyable and delicious 3 hours. A definite must when in Hanoi."

Our guide Sunny was awesome - she escorted our group of 14 with ease through the congested streets of Old Hanoi and took us to some amazing places along the way! We stopped at about 7-8 places and tried a variety of different foods (and beer); the bun cha and banh cuon in particular were highlights. She also provided a lot of interesting information about Hanoi itself, Vietnamese food and culture, and the specific restaurants that we visited. She also provided a list of places and foods that we had along the way, as well as other places in Hanoi to check out on our own. If there's any negative about the tour, it's that there's so much food that it's impossible to finish it all - I would avoid a heavy lunch, and maybe breakfast for that matter."

I felt so much more confident and informed about trying different types of local food after doing this tour. It was fun, educational and social with a 10/10 tour guide. One suggestion would be if they had another tour with more exotic/adventurous food types to try. On;y negative is they don't use the real mid exchange rate when converting 20usd to dong. Instead they use the banks rate which incorporated ~ 3% bank commission. Just silly and spivvy to do that as most people won't pick up on it, but i did, and they waived it for me as i kicked up a stink."

We booked a private tour instead of with a group because we both have rather complicated dietary requirements - I don't eat meat and my wife can't eat dairy or gluten. We wanted to be sure we'd be able to enjoy the food rather than watching the rest of the group eat! When we met our guide, Sunny, she was initially a bit taken aback by the challenge, but then she did us proud. We went on a truly delicious round of different street food locations and were able to eat everything she put in front of us. Not only that, but she was lively and engaging and we genuinely got on. The tour was meant to last 3 hours but we didn't finish until 10:30 pm - which was an extra hour - after drinking Larue beer at \"beer corner\" with a rice wine chaser, followed by (at another location) an egg coffee which I wasn't sure about but which turned out to be truly yum! Like a coffee-flavoured zabaglione. It was a memorable evening which made us feel part of Hanoi. Highly recommended."

This tour is a must if you come to Hanoi. I would definitely recommend it, more so at the beginning of your trip. For anyone experiencing Hanoi, you know (or will soon learn) the streets are chaotic and its a little bit daunting walking around. By doing this tour, you get to learn your bearing, learn how to cross the road (I'm not joking!) and become familiar with the restaurants and see how the real street food is cooked. The food is beautiful. Why bother coming somewhere like Vietnam and not sampling the amazing street food. You stop at approximately 7-8 places and try all kinds of different dishes. I would suggest only having a very small breakfast or no breakfast at all as you are eating for approximately 3 hours. Cherry, our guide was amazing. She was very funny and you could just see she loves her job. Her English is great and her local knowledge is even better. Big thumbs up to her. Great way to spend a half day walking around the city and pretending to be a local :)"

Some of these were table and low seat on the sidewalk. the evening ended up at one of the roads that that are closed off for the evening for the locals (and tourists) to enjoy beer hoi. at about 30c a glass.

And the vendors were in such obscure and hidden places sometimes, that there is no way we would have found them ourselves. Some tips;Go hungry! We made the mistake of having a late lunch and, even with my \"healthy\" appetite, couldn't finish all the food. Ask questions! Every food we tried had a story, and it was just as interesting as the food itself. On a side note, Pixie took the time to give a few dollars to a homeless woman during our walking.

We were in a group of 10 and we set off with our guide Cherry leading us to places i would have walked past, and introducing us to dishes I would have not even tried !!! I can honestly say that there was anything that I didn't like. From the first dish of Papaya and beef salad, to the last dish of coconut ice cream and sticky rice, the food was outstanding. Cherry was very attentive and you could see that she was eager that we enjoyed ourselves. The poor woman had to deal with some vegetarians as well as people who 'can't eat this or that' ... But she organised variants of each dish to suit all the particular requirements.The price includes all the food, its great value for money and surely is a 'must do' for visitors to Hanoi. Thoroughly recommended !!"

We sampled a wide variety of street foods in the old quarter and she was great at explaining how it was prepared, the ingredients and the origins of the dish. Of the eight or so places we went all of the food was great, especially green papaya salad and the egg coffee. As I was getting full and we were winding down the tour, I asked her suggestions for BBQ and Grilled pork Banh Mi, she named a few places which I tried the next day, they too, were excellent.Highly suggest the tour, especially with Hien (Cherry)."

Our guide was the lovely Mango (not her real name BTW). The tour was really great and offered a lot of food (I'm a big guy and I was stuffed). During the entire tour (3 hours) Mango explained what we were eating, how we had to eat it and everything else about the Vietnamese culture. We really enjoyed it and we recommend this tour to everyone."

It was my last night at Hanoi and my German friend Tim, for whom I met at Halong bay suggested that I should do this food tour. And I should thank him because that turned out to be a great advice.The tour start in the middle of old quarter at Kim tours', you can either go with a group or pay slight extra to do a private tour. Tip:If you want to go on the group tour, it starts at 6:30, so you can turn up slightly beforehand and join on the spot. I didn't mind the group tour but it turned out that there were too many people so we had to split the groups and our \"group\" only had 4 people, therefore it was like a private tour anyway.Our tour guide mango was great, she took us through the old quarter and we tried around 10 different places which we would never know to try ourselves. Some of those places had very small entrances or looks very run down from the outside and you'd just walk right past and miss it. Mango also assured us that they've checked the hygiene of all the places so they are all safe to eat from. Some of the food we had include chicken noodles, green papaya with beef jerky, rice paper roll(which we were involved in making ourselves), fried fermented pork, shrimp cake, fruit yogurt, local beer, ice cream, egg coffee and other dishes which I find hard to describe. All the food was delicious, make sure you don't eat lunch because you'll be too stuffed to eat everything. In between all the eating, our guide Mango also gave us mini tours of some local attractions, such as the lake, temples and the local area in general. We had lots of random questions and she was very good in answering them. She apparently studies French, so if you need a French guide, you know who to ask for.Unfortunately I didn't take any photos, because I was too busy eating and having fun. I think there are plenty of photos in the guide to get one's mouth watering."

Annie was our guide and she went out of her way to help us appreciate the wonderful tastes and textures of Vietnamese food. After three hours together on a private tour, Annie seemed more like a friend and not just a guide. She was careful to custom design our tour to fit our unique tastes and requirements and she was very successful. We enjoyed every dish - none of which we had ever tried in Vietnamese restaurants at home. The extra cost for the private tour was definitely worth it. We discovered we liked Bun Cha more than Pho that we had standardized on at home. The surprise to us was how much we loved the \"egg coffee\"- truly a heavenly \"dessert\" for coffee lovers. We now feel confident about our exposure to a variety of Vietnamese treats as we begin our three weeks in Vietnam and are eager to taste a lot more of what this country has to offer in the Central and Southern areas as well as the North. Great job, Annie!"

Most of the time it was on those little stools. Truly this was the highlight of our time in Hanoi. You get a big variety and tasting from making steamed rice pancakes to having egg coffee. This tour is not to be missed especially with Cherry whose enthusiasm for her city and its cuisine overflowed throughout the day. At some point early on I mentioned it was my wife's birthday so at the last stop she surprised her with cake with her name written on it! Something we both will remember for the rest of our lives. Thank you Cherry. By the way you get more than enough to eat."

            "review": "Hanoi Street Food - Amy Amy Amy!. Last nights Hanoi Street Food tour capped off an eleven day Asian tour for my party of four. Worn down and overfed for the entire trip, we needed a spark or inspiration for the tour. We got that and more in our 22 year old tour guide Amy. We booked a private tour ($25US per person for a group of four) just a few hours before the typical start time and were someone blessed with the assignment of Amy.Having taken fantastic food tours/cooking classes over the past week, we have a pretty good idea of what constitutes a good experience and tour. This, my fellow travelers, exceeds on all measures.The tour itself was very well coordinated and creative. We were picked up at our hotel and shuttled to the tour office in the Old Quarter. We paid (I believe they accept either cash or cc), were introduced to Amy and were off immediately on our walking tour. As an aside, there are group tours but for just a few dollars more we chose the private tour which we preferred. Rather than walk through each stop, let me just say that each guide has flexibility on where he/she stops to accommodate their personal favorite. As a result, it seemed as if Amy were more personally connected to each. We stopped and were seated in five different places (two for drinks only) and one street vendor where we took the food and walked. With the exception of the take away street vendor (fried bananas) each stop was an actual restaurant, some with seating outside. The tour lasted three hours and included a significant amount of history, culture and sightseeing in addition to the food. Because of the density and size of the Old Quarter, it was very helpful having a guide walk us through, even though we'd visited earlier on the day on our own.Regarding the quality of the food, each restaurant was unique and interesting and specialized in one primary dish - the sure sign of a great place. Our one slight complaint was in the third restaurant which specialized in fried foods. Besides the place being a bit dirty (food and napkins all over the floor) and being later in the tour, we were all too stuffed to really eat such a heavy assortment. We did our best to sample what was served but may have done better with a lighter dish (at a cleaner restaurant) at that point in the tour. But let me add that this in no way diminishes my very strong endorsement of the tour or of our guide. I know that Hanoi Street Food Tours is very interested in feedback of its guests - so there you go.I'm sure all the guides are wonderful, knowledgeable and speak good English. But its hard to imagine there are any who could provide a better experience, more information or more laughs than Amy. Having been a college tour guide myself, I know that it is difficult to be sincere and fully engaged tour after tour after tour. Amy, a self-described \"foodie\", apparently isn't effected by having done the job for two years. It was as if we had a very close friend provide us every bit of knowledge and love of Hanoi and Hanoi food she possibly could. We encouraged her to join us in a nibble of the mounds of food served to which she declined saying \"I have to stay tiny to trap a man\" with a glint in her eye and a warm smile. Funny, charming, self-effacing, bubbly, energetic and candid, Amy is a very rare find in a world of professionals \"going-through-the-motions\". This young woman is a superstar!I could not endorse the Hanoi Street Food tour any more strongly. And if there is anyway to book Amy as your guide, I'd suggest re-arranging your time in Hanoi to do so. Bravo HSF and Amy! You were the highlight of our trip!!"

Our first stop was not too far down the road to try some crab noodle soup \u2013 yummy. I must admit I would never have tried this hole in the wall, which made it all the more special. Next we had steamed whole crab, cracking and peeling the shell to find the meat before dipping into the delicious ginger and chilli dipping sauce! Then it was off for a walk to the next venue, where we tried some rice flour pancakes with shrimp filling, also yummy. We even had a chance to bake our own pancakes, they are super thin and quite tricky to lift from the pan.Another walk and shrimpcakes next, basically whole shrimp deep fried in a crispy batter, with more dipping sauce of course. It was then time for something sweet, a pancake with a coconut and dried sugar cane filling. Next we had Jellyfish and green papaya salad. It was not to my taste but interesting to try if you had not had it before. Also had a stop to try rice milk, its creamy peanut flavour made it my favourite drink of the tour.It was then time for another sweet stop to try some fresh fruit and ice cream. At this point I was trying desperately to keep up as my tummy was full. After it was time for the main event: Seafood Hotpot! Tasty broth with noodles, veg, and a plate of raw seafood to cook to your taste \u2013 shrimp, fish, snails, tofu, and mushrooms! Halfway through and I could not eat another snail, thank goodness we made it to the end!One last walk to try a traditional northern Vietnamese coffee topped with egg yolk and condensed milk! Beautifully presented and yummy, the perfect ending to an awesome evening! A special thank you to Hien for being a fantastic guide!"

Our guide Hien (Cherry) was great, she was really informative and from a personal point of view brilliantly looked after my vegetarian needs in a predominantly meat orientated environment. We all ate very well but were beaten by the volume of tasty food and drink available. Good value and a great way to see interesting parts of this fab city. Would highly recommend."

The places Annie took us, you can't find anywhere else! Not even in NYC where I grew up. If you can't stand the sight of a little bit dirtiness or just eating on a plastic chair in the middle of the street. Then you shouldn't even bother going to Vietnam. But if you're here for the food. This is the thing to do!MUST: Do the night version of this tour, preferably on the weekend. They close a certain part of the city up and turn it in to walking streets. We elected not to do the Scooter tour, though i heard you get much better food."

We Had only arrived in the country about 2 hours previously before we went on this tour, so it was a great introduction into the food & culture in Vietnam, although the food does vary according to which region you are in. There were 10 people on the walking tour and we all got along just great. We were given a list of foods we were eating for the evening. you did not have to eat all of them if you did not want too or if you could not fit them all in, which is usually the story by the end of the evening. The tour went for about 4 hours. Do not eat lunch before you go. It was good value for money and a great laugh. Loved the Po, Egg coffee & of course the fresh beer. About 50 cents a glass. Beware the stools that you sit on. They are hard to get out of at the best of times, less alone after having a few beers. No further explanation required. You need to find out for yourselves. LOL. As a suggestion do this tour as soon as you arrive in Hanoi. You get to know the food, the location of various shops and eateries that you can go back to at a later time, which we did."

I would confidently say that the highlight of my trip in Hanoi was definitely spending the afternoon hanging out with Nga and chowing down on some really spectacular food! Be sure to come hungry, because they really don't skimp on anything.Being the adventurous types, we told Nga that we were willing to try everything, from tasty comfort food to the crazy unfamiliar items. I thought it was really great that she asked us right away what foods we had already tried so that she could customize tour to create the most unique experience possible for us. So basically everything we had on the tour was a new and exciting experience, which was exactly what we were hoping for having already tried many of the popular local spots. As an added bonus, on our way to our different destinations, Nga would point out special landmarks, locals doing interesting things, etc. and explain a bit of the culture and history behind it. She was also incredibly knowledgeable about all of the topics we asked about, from cooking to culture to local customs, and I really enjoyed having the opportunity to chat with and learn so much from Nga. Talk about an amazing experience, one that engaged both my stomach with food and my mind with knowledge.My review really doesn't do our experience with Nga justice - she is such a sweet, knowledgeable, and overall fun person to hang out with. If you're looking for an awesome time with great food and good company, I definitely recommend booking a private food tour with Hanoi Street Food Tours, especially if you request Nga (Money) as your guide!"

We had a fantastic time on this private food tour and would recommend it highly to anyone who loves food and cares about getting the authentic Vietnamese eating experience!Our tour guide, Nga (aka \"Money\"), took us to try a wide array of authentic foods, chatting with us the entire time about life in Hanoi and answering our endless questions about food, culture, and random things we noticed around the area. At each stop, she explained what was in the dish and how to eat it the proper Vietnamese way. She was clearly very knowledgable about the local food and culture, and she knew Hanoi's streets like the back of her hand. Not to mention that her English was impeccable; we didn't have any communication problems at all during the tour.What we really liked was that Nga tailored the foods on the trip to our interests. For example, we had already tried bun cha on our own the day before, so she took us to get a different kind of dish so that we could try something new. We also told her that we wanted to try anything that the local people like to eat (even more adventurous things), so she took us to try fertilized duck egg, which was definitely one of the craziest things we'd ever eaten and totally not something we would have found otherwise!While this tour is structurally all about the food, we also learned about Vietnamese life by chatting with Nga. She took the time to answer every one of our many questions with a thoughtful and detailed response. From the second we met, she was extremely friendly and very sweet, and her warm personality made her easy to talk to. Nga was also kind enough to point out a few landmarks and tell us some traditional stories along the way. At the end of the tour, Nga wrote down (in impeccable handwriting) all the places we had gone and the foods we had tried so that we could find them again if we wanted to return. She also wrote us some recommendations for what else to eat (and where to get it) so that we could visit on our own after the tour, which was really helpful since we were very full at the time but would surely want more food later during our trip!Getting to spend a few hours with Nga was easily the highlight of our trip to Hanoi. It's not every day that you get to hang out with (and learn from) a local. We really enjoyed spending time with her and it was sad to say goodbye at the end of the tour. We're so glad that we booked this tour because it gave us the opportunity to try the local foods in a fun way and make a new friend in Vietnam!"

Our guides, Mia and Lily, were both entertaining and informative, and most importantly they knew where to find the most delicious food. At the end of the tour they handed us a list of all of the places we ate at as well as the food we had at each stop.

From the very beginning she asked if anyone of us had dietary limitations or allergies. She made sure that the person with the allergy was not served seafood or shellfish. She also asked our food preferences. Jun was friendly and knowledgeable. She did her best to answer our questions and also did her best to keep the small group safe while walking everywhere. There are around 6-7 stops for the food, so make sure you didn't eat a full lunch. We skipped lunch and I think that was a really good idea. Come hungry! The food introduced to us had a good variety. We even returned for bun cha a few days after in the place we had it with the tour. We really enjoyed the food. It's a great way to make new friends as well.

Our guide,Pixie, was friendly and knowledgeable. We had foods ranging from Pillow cake to delicious Bun Cha.

Straight off the plane basically couple hours rest and we were collected at our hotel - the 6 of us for a private street food tour with Amy (thumbs up!). She was great a wealth of information and tips on eating our way around Vietnam.We loved this tour - we made sure we were hungry at the start and we were so full by the end we told her to miss one stop! Loved the Bo Biah man on the bike near the lake - the elusive man as we could not find him any night after that!We revisited several of the places she took us to during our next couple of days in Hanoi. It was fabulous to know where we could eat and what we could eat safely - and literally eat on the street on the tiny plastic stools just like the locals - do this tour you will not regret it!"

I was very nervous right about riding on a motorbike but Amy made me feel safe and it was an amazing experience. Every place we visited had delicious food. We started in the Old Quarter with fried snacks, crab spring rolls, pork skins and sweet sesame balls. Very delicious. Then we went for the best lunch in Hanoi! It was a local spot not many tourist go to. Noodles with pork meatballs and pork belly in an amazing broth. After that we toured around Hanoi. In addition to the street food Amy showed me many important sites in Hanoi and we did site seeing. We also had a traditional dessert, egg coffee and finally the best papaya beef salad I have ever had. This was my 2nd day in Hanoi. My first day I was a bit overwhelmed and not sure I even liked it here. But after this day I have changed my mind about Hanoi. Amy was a great guide. She spoke good English and was very knowledgeable about her city's history and made sure to share with me interesting facts about the culture and traditions of Vietnam. I can't say enough nice things about her. The private tour is more expensive obviously, but I think it's worth it. At the end of the tour into her she changed my view of Hanoi and that she is a great ambassador for her city. She said it made her day to hear this. I'm glad because she made my trip extra special so like the golden turtle, I was glad to return the favor."

She was a great host and encouraged us to try things in places we would never have stopped at on our own. Watching her walk calmly into the middle of the terrifying Hanoi traffic gave us the confidence to cross the street too! We stopped off at eight different places for nine different snacks/dishes over the course of about three hours, ranging from breakfast noodles to ice cream, student snacks to egg coffee . Even the private tour cost only US$30 per head which seems good value to me and included all the food plus the guide. She made the trip for us and was interesting, friendly and informative, with excellent English. I understand she also does other tours, including a scooter tour which frankly sounds quite terrifying but I think I might try if I ever go back to Hanoi."

We did the tour from 11am to 2pm and were still full enough that we didn't have dinner. Miss Moon was attentive and accommodating with respect to our 9 year old daughter, and ordered her an \"egg chocolate\" at the last stop, instead of the \"egg coffee\" that the adults had (and both were delicious!)."

She was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and very tolerant of her mature group of revellers - there was only one of us younger than 60!. She had patience in abundance even though we tried our hardest we could not get the pronunciation of ngon correct, however she was fine with us all standing and shouting \"delicious\", so she kept us happy. As a mark of respect we continued throughout our week in Hanoi to use her phrase \"Sticky Rice\" whenever we crossed the road. If the advice and information on food supplied in other reviews is still not enough to persuade you then take a gamble and ask for Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng (Phoenix) she will not let you down. And if you look anything like Benedict Cumberbatch she will be especially glad to take you on a merry tour of the town."

Our guide Amy was a delight - full of funny little stories and eager to explain to us the right way to eat each dish, what toppings to put where. She never stopped smiling and also taught us how to deal with crossing Hanoi's crazy streets. We made 4 x local restaurant stops to eat their specialities (two we enjoyed so much we went back during our stay), we tried Bo Bia from a man that made it all on a platform on the back of his bike - a yummy sweet mix of milky crunchy, coconutty flavours. We have been trying to track the Bo Bia man down again but have not managed to find him yet! Much to Amy's disappointment we had to turn down two eating stops on the tour as we were all so full of delicious food and instead opted to finish up with an egg-coffee .... mmmm that one I am not going to revisit but that's what street food is all about - discovering things you love and others not so much ..."

What's helpful is that she shows you the best places, and how to eat things in the right way (which isn't always obvious, but always more delicious.)There were a couple dishes we were interested in that we didn't get to try on the tour, so we asked her for her recommendations.

Our guide Mango was awesome and gave us a lot of information about the food and history of the area. Do not eat lunch if you are doing a afternoon tour. We were so full. There is a fair amount of walking but it was good to walk between eating."

We booked a private tour which is not much more expensive than the group tour, but you get the benefit of tailoring the menu to your own preferences. We had about 4 specific dishes not listed in the itinerary that we had wanted to try, and our lovely guide Phuong (Phoenix) made sure that we got to sample all that we requested. I highly recommend Phuong as a guide; she's super friendly, patient, and explains each dish in detail before you eat. Also, at the end of the tour, she wrote down everything we ate and even gave us a mini lesson on the Vietnamese language. If you have a free night in Hanoi, be sure to take this tour!"

KiWi our guide was a great deal of fun, we weren't sure what to expect but the first meal out of the gate, Bun Cha and we were sold! A great tour, worth going hungry and liking fish sauce. Thoroughly cemented a deep seated love affair with Vietnamese food, which we are already missing! Can definitely recommend KiWi as a fantastic, fun and enthusiastic guide. And as the person who first helped us cross the insanely busy streets with the 'sticky rice' technique she will hold a special place in our hearts :)"

At the beginning we felt that she was a bit in a rush, and we just spent a few minutes in each place, but on the last places it become better and we sat comfortably. I felt like the tour wasn't that informative as I would want it to be. And the guide's English wasn't that good (only understand half of what she said). We did it on our first day in Vietnam so for me it was a very good introduction to the Vietnamese cuisine, which helped me a lot during the trip (I already knew what I like and should order at restaurants).Although I really enjoyed it, don't think it was a good money value, because it was quite pricey."

I had Cherry as a tour guide and she was very good. Cherry took us to places that I would never of gone to. It was like I had a private tour because there was only 2 people on the tour. My only complaint is that if I had not phoned to confirm I would of missed the tour. The tour date was changed and I was not notified. Be prepared that some of these places are dirty. You will be sitting on very small stools. A tip - wear comfortable shoes."

We loved our guide, Nga, a recent college graduate. She was knowledgeable, helpful and so friendly and enthusiastic! We walked for over 3 hrs. and sampled food at 9 restaurants. This included delicious rice ice cream and egg coffee. We liked it all, but we were stuffed! We did this on a Sat. night, so the streets were filled with locals, mostly young people sitting on little stools eating and drinking and visiting with each other and just enjoying the weekend. One street was for pedestrians only and was set up like a mini-playground for children with various types of play equipment arranged down the middle of the street. It was so rewarding to be there among the locals and witness their Hanoi on a Sat. night. This was my favorite experience of our entire 19 day trip. I would definitely recommend Kim's Hanoi Street Food Tour and Nga as a guide."

Our tour started at 6.30pm and as it was a Friday night, we got to see the Old Quarter in all it's manic glory as the night market was on and there was a lot of street entertainment also. If you are wanting a little more calm, then I suggest doing the 11.30am tour, or picking an evening other than Friday, Saturday or Sunday when the night markets are on. Our guide told us some interesting things about local life in Hanoi and Vietnam, which was great. Being able to spend time with this lovely young lady was probably the highlight.

Friendly, chirpy and excellent English speakers, not to mention safe and confident scooter riders. The tour itself was everything we hoped for. We did a similar tour in Saigon which was a much slower pace and only took in three different eateries over a similar time. This tour was action packed and included seven stops. We'd already said we didn't need to be back to our hotel after three hours and would be happy if it over-ran, and we ended up being out and about for nearly four hours because we were having so much fun. I've not doubt we could have kept to time if we'd needed to. The girls asked what food we'd eaten during our time in Vietnam and adjusted the tour to ensure everything we tried was new. Highlights included the new style pho rolls, fried sour pork rolls, crab soup and Vietnamese coffee with egg. We ate so much food, and won't be needing lunch today. We also popped over the Red River using the old rail bridge to go one way and the newer road bridge to come back which gave us some good photo opportunities. The girls kept a handwritten note of all the foods we ate and included some restaurant and bar recommendations for the rest of our time in Hanoi which was a really nice touch. All in all an excellent use of a morning in Hanoi. Vietnam has given us some brilliant moments and this was one of them. Highly recommended."

Working out where to eat in Hanoi was a challenging and somewhat daunting experience with so many street food vendors, cafes and restaurants lining the streets, so my husband and I decided to give this awesome tour a shot. What an experience it was! We were taken by motorbikes around the foodie hot spots of the old quarter and were then driven further a field across the bridge to the hang outs where only the locals venture. Whilst the food was pretty awesome (I especially loved the coconut ice cream and egg coffee!) the highlight of our tour was the beautiful company and insights provided by our two wonderful guides, Pixie and Viv. Not only did they share their extensive food knowledge but they also provided us with incredible local insights about their city and heritage. I'd highly recommend this tour but would recommend the guides even more highly. Thank you Pixie and Viv for a truly memorable evening! :)"

We had a private street food tour and it was well worth it. We tried food we never would have thought to and also restaurants we would never have entertained going to. It was great and we even went back to a few of the restaurants the next night ourselves to try more food on their menu.What made the tour so enjoyable was also our tour guide, Sunny (Diep). She was great and explained each restaurant in depth from they way they cook the food, their sepcialties, how to eat each dish, etc. She also wrote down a recommended menu for us to use for the rest of our trip in Hanoi and gave us some helpful information and tips on other tours and things we should do in Hanoi, not to mention some good stories about the old town and some of the sights we walked past during our street food tour. She made the tour very enjoyable and we would recommend others using Sunny in the future."

She also gave us plenty of extra information about the areas we were walking through, with some local history and a bit of cultural background info.Due to the time of year it starting raining heavily during the tour and Diep insisted on buying us plastic ponchos which was very sweet of her (not sure this would be a guaranteed part of every tour!).This was an excellent introduction to food in Hanoi, and our guide left us with a great list of each dish and where we ate it, along with further recommendations if we were staying on in Hanoi.

She asked the proper questions and made the group comfortable in sharing each other's food preferences (we were with 2 lovely couples from Argentina and Germany). I appreciate it that these eating places are where the locals eat and grab meals everyday, the range of food choices was just right---from soups, fried food, wraps, pickled fruits, iced desserts, ending with their local beer, Banh Mi and egg coffee.

The Hanoi Street Food Tour with the gorgeous Amy as our guide was really wonderful from start to finish and we can't recommend it or her enough. There were two of us and we chose to do a private tour. Personally I feel this is the way to go as many of the restaurants are really small and crowded so I'm not sure large groups would be able to go to all of the same places as we did. Also, the streets in the Old Quarter are really narrow and crowded so with only the three of us we were able to walk together and talk.Amy was enthusiastic, interesting and knowledgable, her English was excellent and she went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed ourselves and learnt as much as possible about Hanoi and the food we were served, (she even arranged to have my earring fixed free of charge as we were eating our dessert!) We have had quite a bit of experience with Vietnamese cuisine but even still there were some foods we'd never tried before. Without exception all of the food we had was absolutely fresh and delicious. Most of the places we visited, had we not been with a guide, we either wouldn't have had a clue what or how to order or we wouldn't have known the restaurants were even there as some were accessed down dark laneways or up stairs without English signage. Having Amy there though enabled us to try places and foods we as tourists wouldn't have otherwise. Thank you so much Amy, we will certainly recommend you and the tour to friends."

It costs more than double to the walking tour, but the difference is we get to try to ride at the back of the motorcycle in rush hour traffic. There is no way to reach old quarter that fast during rush hour using a taxi. 2nd, we get like a private tour since we got 3 motorcycles as we were 3 people. What i heard is that the walking tour is a group of people sharing 1 or 2 guides and according to my guide/driver, these walking tours can exceed what the website's stated maximum number per group, which concurs with what some reviews here complained about.We were brought to so many food outlets that by around the halfway point, our tummies were already very full. I seem to have misread the description of the tour because it stated \"our foodie tour focuses on street food that most people outside vietnam have never had a chance to experience, so NO banh cuon, banh mi, bun cha, ba hoi, egg coffee. Well, we got to eat these. I was thrown off by the word \"NO\". I was hoping for some grilled food just like the foodie tour I have done in ho chi minh, but we were not brought to one. We did ask for some seafood and was brought to another food that was still noodle soup based. If we wanted more seafood selection, we were told that is using another tour called seafood tour, also in the website. No grilled food option was given. But I saw in one of the cheaper foodie tour that grilled food was part of it. We were full, but we were given too much noodle soup based food.Because we were on motorbike, we were able to see places like the ho chi minh mausoleum although only at the outside as it was already closed, the catholic church, and even did a stopover at the lake.What i was surprised unhappily was that at the end of the tour, they flagged us a taxi to return to our hotel. I was expecting that the package included hotel pick up AND return. Overall, I think the walking foodie tour will suffice than the scooter option."

Highly recommended for all freshies who are coming to hanoi to join this food tour and special mention to have \"Money\" as your guide! The only bad thing was, it requires LOTS of walking but.. it's worth it!Warning: BE HUNGRY because you're gonna end the night with exploding tummies. ;)"

It was a walking tour and our guide Moon is a very nice lady. We tried 8 different food which are local to old quarter. All very tasty. Suggest to go for day tour as some well known stalls only open during daytime. Most dishes are with meat so may be difficult if you are vegetarian. We love the bun cha which is rice noodles served with pork patty in honey and kam quat soup and egg coffee. Highly recommended tour."

A little nervous about a scooter tour after seeing the traffic, but our nerves were quickly settled.Mia, Lily and Kelly picked us up from our hotel and we were off on an awesome adventure. The ladies were fantastic, accomodating and very informative, would highly recommend this company.The scooter riding was exhilarating and we flew like birds.The food was amazing, but make sure you have a very light lunch, there is heaps, the flavours were amazing and they are able to accomodate dietary requirements and tastes... But we gave everything a go and surprised ourselves... Food we would not have tried on our own.Thank you again to our fantastic guided, you all were amazing!"

I was backpacking around the world and it was a bit expensive to the average activity in Vietnam but I decided to take his advice and do it (45 USD).I am really glad that I did it because it was (by far) the best thing that I have done in the city. The experience is AMAZING, my guide Cherry was super nice and I was able to taste amazing food (and weird dishes that I always like to try as I am not a very picky eater).I would recommend everyone to do this, it is a good way to visit the city and try the Vietnamese cuisine, which is incredible.Make the effort. It is worth every penny."

She explained everything that she ordered for us, and showed us the correct way to eat that particular food. Mixing the chilli and vinegar with fish sauce first for dipping etc. really cool to be told how to do all this properly. She brought us to little places that we definitely would not have tried ourselves as they were places with all local people eating. Some places didn't physically look the best but the food was AMAZING. I would recommend the walking tour as it gives you a chance to weave around old town without the hassle of trying to figure things out for yourself. We did the tour towards the end of travelling in Vietnam for two and a half weeks. If you start your trip in Hanoi do it straight away as it will leave you ready to try and enjoy street food thoughout your trip as you'll have an idea of what things are."

He was very mindful of our safety especially as I have a tendancy to wander and not a good thing on Hanoi streets with traffic coming at you in all directions!

We kept comparing everything else we ate to it. We had Moon and Butterfly as guides. They were very engaging and flexible. If you had any food in particular you couldn't eat they would substitute it for something else. But as we were warned by another person be careful not to fill up at the first place. I recommend not eating breakfast as you stop at many places and you get a lot of food. One of the best meals was the grilled pork patty seasoned with honey. No where else was it as good. Hope this helps."

In the morning we contacted the agency through email and everything was set up by our pickup time of 6pm. We chose the scooter food tour because we were feeling a little adventurous. Lily and Mia, our tour guides, picked us up and gave us a thorough safety overview of how to ride on the scooters. It was definitely scary at first, but the guides definitely made us feel comfortable and safe. We proceeded to the agency where everything was paid and sorted. We then proceeded to about 6-7 locations sampling the different foods from different neighborhoods and vendors. We also got a quick tour of Hanoi. If you are up for a little challenge, definitely choose the scooter tour. Walking or scooter, definitely choose Mia and Lily as they were great guides and gave us a great insight as to the daily life of Hanoi."

The food was great and all clean and interesting. I was expecting to see more local traditional delicacies like snake, scorpions etc but it was more street food maybe like a proper meal that you would eat at home in Vietnam. We had about 8 different types of dishes from 8 different places including some beers and also rice wine. They also took us off the tourist trail which was even more interesting away from tourist which made the tour feel all the more authentic. I think what would be better would be to take you more off the beaten path as most of the street food places were in the tourist areas so it still didn't feel like it had the fully authenticity of the the real street food. But overall it was excellent and if you don't have much time in Hanoi then this would be the best choice. I would highly recommend this tour."

The guides spoke good English and were also really good when it came to allergies - some in the group having nut and fish allergies and there were no problems catering to those people. Food ranged from pork noodles, to fried pastries, to dried beef and squid and ice cream too! Great value and a great way to get inside places you may otherwise walk past."

We were picked up on Motor bikes at our hotel and began the tour at their office with a 1 hour cyclo tour of the Old Quarter . It was really great seeing an overview of the area. When we finished the cyclo tour we were introduced to our guide Mango. She was amazing. The first thing she taught us was how to cross the crazy streets of Hanoi. At first it was a bit scary but as the night went on we got a hang of it. We had such a great time with Mango, getting to know her and learning about all the different kinds of street foods. Things that we may not have tried and didn't know about them. In fact Mango was so awesome she wrote down a list of everything we ate and the address for us to go back during our stay in Hanoi. All of the food we tried was delicious and very safe. I would highly recommend this tour and if you can get Mango as your guide you're very lucky. She's a lovely person and a great tour guide. As we left we gave Mango a Thank you gift from our home town Raleigh NC. She really loved it."

We had some reservations about riding pillion on motorbikes as suggested by the manager who took our call, as opposed to the walking tour. The traffic in Hanoi is not for the faint-hearted!!When Lily & Mia picked us up from our hotel the next morning, we were more nervous. They're both so young & petite....how would they be able to handle the motorbikes?? But we found that our fears were totally unfounded - from the minute they helped us with our helmets, & showed us how to climb onto the bikes, and the way they confidently rode the bikes safely through the traffic, we had the confidence that we were in for a great time!! Both Lily & Mia are very knowledgeable, constantly providing background information on the places we passed by, and then bringing us to the many little food stalls or cafes for really yummy food - deepfried rolls, ban xeo, bun cha, egg coffee and many others, and explaining the types of food to us. I forget the number of places we were brought to for great food!!And then at the end, they brought us to a local healthcare centre for a 2-hour herbal bath & massage too!!We enjoyed ourselves so much with Lily & Mia that before the end of our 4-hour tour, we had booked them for another half-day tour the next day, where we were brought to the military museum and a drive past the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum which we skipped as there was a really long queue waiting. We were also brought to a huge local market, and got to ride across the old bridge. Lunch was a delicious bowl of beef pho at Pho 10, followed by delicious coconut coffee at Cong Caf\u00e9.We had a lovely time with Lily & Mia - both are very warm, friendly & also reliable. They were also curious to find out about our culture, without being rude, and we were happy to share with them. We will be back with family next year, and will definitely ask for Lily & Mia, our 2 Hanoi angels again!"

So, Cherry found the duck eggs, had them prepared and showed my husband and the other person how to eat them. As I typed, she is amazing.We tried so much food for green papaya salad to beers and beer snacks to coffee to desserts to banh mi.

We went on a private tour from 830am-230pm on our first full day in Hanoi. We made our way to the coffee shop that we were told to meet at and from there we went on a tour of the city. We started with some fish soup and ended with a coffee that had egg white in it. It was all DELICIOUS! We ate and ate and ate. Our guide was very informative and became like a tour guide of the city and the food scene. Since we had never been to Hanoi and didn't know a ton about it, he was great at educating on us about the local culture, food, etc. We each paid $135 and then our guide paid for all the food, drinks, taxis, etc. There is no way we would have had a food experience like that while we were in Hanoi without him. It is 200% worth it! We were even considering doing a 2nd tour for dinner but ended up going to Pots and Pans. Pots and Pans had high ratings and it was good but we wished we would have gone back to just do another tour with our guide. I haven't had a chance to go through all my pictures but I got some amazing shots! This should be #1 on your list to do in Hanoi."

We went to about 10 different spots and everywhere you get pretty much a full meal, she fully explains all the ingredients, how local ppl eat, names, translations and while walking around town also a bit of history about certain spots and whatever you ask about Vietnam she can tell you a lot. All the spots were very local street food places and everything was sooo tasty and big! It alo includes water, local beer at one of the last spots and a special local coffee and rice wine tasting. All for $20, tour lasts about 3 hours which gives yous plenty of time in each place. Absolutely recommend, you will not taste amazing food but learn soo much about this fantastic culture!"

She took us to places we would never have found without her, and places we would never have been confident enough to eat at. Down little alleyways, to street carts, up stairs in tiny little restaurants full of locals, we ate the most beautiful food we've had anywhere in Vietnam. We highly recommend this tour, it is great value for money and allows you to explore the true soul of Hanoi - the street food!"

We arranged this because we arrived the very same evening and thought we need to know the local food from Day 1. We were not disappointed as Nga was an excellent guide with very good English. I lost count of how many dishes she let us try but they are all very good, especially Bun Cha (which we revisited twice!). And we are extremely lucky to have Nga as our guide and she is very sweet and thoughtful. She wrote down all the restaurants' addresses for us and also recommend some other places for different dishes. She also answers all the questions. If you are a foodie or interested in knowing more about Vietnamese cuisine, this is a very good start."

At $25/person for four people it seemed worth it. Our guide was Cherry and she was wonderful. She showed us great places to eat, answered our questions, and generally provided us with a great experience. We spent about four hours on our tour and tried more dishes than we could count from Bun Cha, to green papaya salad, savory pancakes, kumquat green tea, a selection of fried foods, Bia Hoi, Vietnamese Coffee (with the choice of egg coffee), a fruit and condense milk dessert, Banh Mi...and I am sure others I am forgetting. This allowed us to both find great places to get old favorites and learn about some foods which we were previously unfamiliar with. In addition, Cherry was extremely helpful in facilitating vegetarian options for me while allowing everyone else to eat the meat options. If you like food and want to explore the Old Quarter go on this tour--but make sure to show up hungry!"

Ms Moon ensured i got a real flavour (no pun intended) of what Hanoi really has to offer in the culinary department.First piece of advice, go on an empty stomach, you will be fed exceptionally well and will not be left wanting! I tried a wide variety of 12 separate dishes and bites, clearly covering a good spectrum of Hanoi street food. I won't go into detail about the various dishes but I genuinely enjoyed all of them. (Disclaimer: I'm not a remotely fussy eater) The tour was also a great way to wonder around the Old Quarter and see various nooks and crannies you'd never venture into otherwise.

But if you have an English speaking guide you would expect they would act as an interpreter and advocate for you with vendors. And most dishes were modified for my diet. However once I was told, \"It contains Vietnamese sausage, just don't eat that.\"Hmmm. My partner was able to taste all dishes and he commented it was modest at best. So many opportunities were missed on this tour: no market, no funky Cafe Pho Co, very little local information and history. Customers on the tour were promised a menu of all the food we ate. We got it too: it was hand written on one sheet of paper and we were told to take a photo. Maybe a full menu and a map of our tour would have been better. Lovely, lovely guide but this mob could learn so much from the people who run \"The Great Taste of Hoi An.\" That was a five star experience where the food was the star. This was a walk around the streets of Hanoi with food thrown in. Not impressed at all."

That's why this is so great. For 20 bucks you get stuffed on the best food I've had in SE Asia. Your guide brings you to small hole in the wall spots you would never walk in as a tourist. We had a lovely guide named Lotus who is a 21 year old Hanoi native. Not only did she explain the food and how to eat it, but she dived deep into the Vietnamese culture and what it's like to grow up and live in Hanoi."

There address is on the website, simply turn up and book your tickets. They have tours at 11am, 5pm and 6:30pm. Money (the English nickname for our guide) was amazing. She spoke great English. Explained all the dishes extremely well. When it started raining she went and bought us all waterproof tops to throw over so we stayed dry between stops. Answered any questions that were asked. There was 8 of us in total. A great group size. At the end of the tour she gave us all the names and descriptions of the dishes so we can easily order them again. She even gave us a bunch of other recommendations for resteraunts and dishes so those staying in Hanoi for awhile can go check them out.There was so much food. We went on the 5pm tour and finished at 8pm. I would suggest not eating anything much at all before, we had a brunch at 11am and still struggled there is just so much good food. Well worth the money (20usd per person) paid in Dong.Do it, you won't regret it!!!"

We went to the office and it was a bit chaotic with lots of people trying to sign up for various tours. Didn't feel very welcomed at all. We were a group of 12 people from all over the world and we set off to visit 7 different places for food. We started with Bun Cha at a small local restaurant that also served other dishes. We only had Bun Cha there and although it seems that the restaurant was famous for other dishes, no other dishes were explained or mentioned. We then left and went to a street stall with green papaya salad followed with rice crepes, lemon tea, fried spring rolls, jackfruit and yoghurt and finally egg coffee. The food at each place was nice but lacked detailed explanation. There were also lots of other street food along the way that would have been great if it had been explained to us...drinks with all sorts, fried dough balls, potato spirals...it felt as it the tour as getting us from one place to another, feed us and that was it. There was not interest in explaining in detail. All in all, found it lacking and saw some other tours where the guides were more forthcoming with information. In fact one other tour had the opportunity to try their hand at making the rice flour crepes when we were just ushered into the restaurant without even the opportunity to observe the crepes being made. We had to walk through the night market and the tour guide didn't even make sure that the group was complete as part of the group fell behind and was left wondering. All in all, didn't think it was worth the money...maybe it was the guide but thought that it could have been much better. Does it deserve the top spot...I didn't think so."

We walked all around the old quarter, eating on the street, in back room areas and upstairs in a hidden little cafe for coffee.

Decided to go on this food tour as it was the highest rated in that category and me and my friend hadn't really had a taste of the Vietnamese street food as we've always been a bit weary with where we eat. We arrived about 15 minutes before the tour started at 5pm thinking they may have been all booked out but luckily there was still room for us and they gladly let us join the tour. Our tour guides name was Lan Anh (nick named Kiwi). She speaks English well and is legitimately the nicest person I've met in Vietnam so far! The rest of the group consisted of 3 Korean women who couldn't speak a word of English or Vietnamese but still Kiwi would try to talk to them and include them in the conversation. The 3 women weren't eating much and ended up leaving the tour due to some light rain... Kiwi continued the tour with me and my friend. She's a very likeable person and very easy to talk to. She lead us through the streets of Hanoi taking us to several restaurants which I never would have seen. Go with an empty stomach as there are quiet a few places you visit. Kiwi walked us back to the tour guide station and let me use the work laptop so I could check my emails. We were heading to the Water puppet theatre after the tour so she gave us directions and after still being confused about where to go she then kindly offered to walk us there and spoke to the cashier for us. I tried to tip her but she kindly refused and just asked that we reviewed the tour on TripAdvisor. Highly recommend if you would like to taste some Vietnamese cuisines you've probably never tasted or heard of or even if you just want a pleasant tour around the streets of Hanoi."

Hien aka Cherry gave me a quick run down on scooter safety and offered to buy me a raincoat, I pulled out a parka and we were off. Our first stop was for Pho, but the place was packed so took off for another spot. Long story short I saw and ate more in the three plus hours than I ever could have done on my own.Cherry was an outstanding driver, guide.

She offered to drop me off anywhere after our beer, but I was perfectly happy with walking around the Old Quarter soaking up the sun.Overall I highly recommend this tour group and Cherry as a very knowledgable, friendly guide for making my stay in Hanoi a very memorable one."

If you are not familiar with the Vietnamese language this tour can be very helpful with figuring out what certain words mean. Then you can start to understand what places are serving when walking around the city. The tour guide was super nice and informative. It was a nice experience to walk around the old quarter with other travelers and share new experiences with new people in a new city. Fun. Highly recommend it."

I'd recommend other travelers add this to the beginning of their itineraries as well. You will gain confidence in sitting, ordering and eating at local food stalls for your following meals. Also our tour started at 5PM and ended at BIA HOI a local spot for people watching and drinking inexpensive fresh local beer. A perfect way to end the night getting to know our guide Cherry who was very sweet and passionate about her job. Also, a great opportunity to connect with other travelers on our tour."

First off, riding on the back of a motorbike was so much fun! I know I personally was a little scared at first but all of the drivers were very safe and I became very comfortable on it by the end. Doing this tour also allowed us to see so much of Hanoi that we wouldn't have otherwise seen (we went over past West Lake and saw that neighborhood including \"the most beautiful street in Hanoi\" which definitely held up its name). Secondly, the food was all amazing! We went to so many tiny hole in wall places that look like nothing from the outside but serve the most incredible meals. Last (but definitely not least) Amy was our tour guide and she was amazing! Our group absolutely loved her - I was lucky enough to be on the back of her bike and she told me so much about the areas we were driving past and just really made the experience so fun! Plus her English is phenomenal - we never had a difficult time understanding her. This 3 hour tour was definitely a highlight of our entire two and a half week trip in Southeast Asia and I would HIGHLY recommend it. If the price is deterring you (the motor bike tour was around $40/person) I can assure you that it is worth every penny!"

She ensured we were entirely safe the entire time as we negotiated traffic on only our second day. She took us to places we wouldn't have dared going ordinarily, many within meters of our accommodation! She even got us in and places packed with locals which seemed impossible. Learned heaps. Ate even more! Awesome young lady. Great experience. Do this before you do anything else in Hanoi to ensure you get your compass calibrated before you eat street."

This made the experience so much better and Kiwi made sure to not only tell me about the food but also about the history of Vietnam and talk with me about the cultural aspects of different places in Vietnam. As a consequence I think she is the reason the experience was so amazing. The food I tasted was really good and I expected nothing less from the Vietnamese cuisine.

We shared travel stories while being shown different venues to eat in and different REAL Vietnamese food to eat by our tour guide, Ling. Ling was a brilliant tour guide and really couldn't have been friendlier, kinder and really made us feel like we were out with friends, nevermind a tour group consisting of random people! Ling took us to some great places which the average tourist would never think, or have the confidence, to visit. Highlights included getting involved with some of the food preparation and visiting a Vietnamese coffee house and drinking egg coffee surrounded by sunflower seeds! On our walk to different venues Ling was full of stories about history and culture whenever we passed something of note. It was like two tours in one! It really was a highlight of my Vietnam trip and I would recommend this tour to all! At $20 USD this tour is an absolute steal - get involved!"

Our scooter tour guides, Trang and Le Thi, were fantastic -- they took us to the most interesting and authentic Vietnamese corners to try some of the best dishes we've ever tried throughout our travels around the world.We also visited some of the major historical sites in Hanoi, which were all outstanding. Our guides were very knowledgable about the social, political, and economic history of the region. They also let me drive the scooter for a good part of the tour, which was a lot of fun. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone traveling to Hanoi, either for a few days or a few weeks.

The tour operator was very accommodating and granted our request that our guide from last year, Amy, lead our group tour this time. The selection of food vendors was different and, not that I would have thought it possible, but the food was even better than last time. There is a difference between the two tour options. On the walking tour you are better able to ask questions about the historical/cultural things you see when travelling from site to site. The guides that work for this tour operator are very enthusiastic and knowledgable about the history, customs, etc of their home town and that really adds to the value of the walking tour. I felt that this aspect was slightly diminished on the scooter tour. However, for anyone who has stood on the roadside and marvelled at the chaotic Vietnamese traffic, I can only say that it is even better experienced from the back of a scooter. Overall, it was a fantastic tour. All of our 5 scooter guides were friendly, helpful, courteous, and enthusiastic. Amy was brilliant as usual. The food was excellent. And the scooters made it a very special experience."

Going to Vietnam hearing all the amazing food that the country offers really intrigued me and therefore a street food tour is a must! Ngo was our tour guide of the day. She was so energetic and really passionate about the food. She has a wide knowledge of the local food and even bought us to one of the egg coffee place where she designed her own egg coffee recipe! One of the best I have had in Hanoi! Big thumb up to Ngo and thank you for such a great experience!"

We knew it was going to be fun. 10 people is the max for any group, and there were several groups who left at the same time, but all seemed to end up at different places at different times. Our guide was Lotus, who was very sweet and very petite and whose English was a little difficult to understand. But she managed to communicate the critical issues: first of all - how to cross the street. Hanoi traffic is like nothing I've ever seen (including Beijing, Bangkok, and my home town of Los Angeles). It flows like a river. No one stops. No one honks. No one screeches. But from a pedestrian standpoint, it appears impossible to breach. Not so. Lotus taught us the concept of \"sticky rice\", moving as a unit, and simply striding across the street. Very powerful. This is truly a walking tour, so be prepared for blocks and blocks of exploring. We went to eight different places. Please come hungry, or you will miss the delight of tasting all the dishes. Portions did not seem that small, and we tasted every possible combination of traditional and untraditional foods, including foods prepared on the street, as well as indoors. Be prepared to sit on very low blue plastic stools (I think the blue plastic stool business is the business to be in...). Crowded together. Maybe a little warm. Water provided. They accommodated my husband, who does not eat red meat, without any problem. We ended up with \"egg coffee\" at our second to last stop and finished with a bowl of distinctly different fresh fruit in large pieces, topped with a yogurt/cream. (We had covered many different neighborhoods by then.) This place was packed.The fruits were fresh and even included avocado, along with rambutan, pineapple, banana, and lots of other goodies. Lotus showed us how to take the spoon and mash it all together. That was the tradition. My husband, who is a great admirer of the beauty of freshly cut fruit, couldn't bring himself to \"smoosh\" all those beautiful chunks. So Lotus simply took his bowl away and gave him a lesson in \"remedial mashing\". Became a running joke throughout the rest of our trip. Very much enjoyed the food and the expedition. Wear comfortable shoes, loose clothing (because you will eat and squat a lot), and a sense of humor. Expect to spend at least 3 hours on the tour."

By the end our whole team was stuffed full of food but Phoenix organised takeaway Banh Mi for our group as she insisted on us all trying some regardless.I could not have asked for a more knowledgeable and considerate guide and it was fantastic rubbing shoulders with locals as you went to street side stalls, sat on tiny stools and tucked into a bowl/plate of deliciousness which you would otherwise not have the opportunity to do if you were travelling independently.

We paid in cash (USD also accepted) at their office, and after asking us if we had any personal preferences or dietary restrictions (e.g. \"would you try spider? snake? dog?\"), Lotus took us on an expedition to try 8 different restaurants throughout the Old Quarter. Her English conversation skills are impressive, despite only having studied it independently for about a year. She was also very friendly, patient, and hospitable when it came to explaining the dishes, making conversation about life in Vietnam, or answering any of our questions.I won't spoil the tour destinations for you (the food is included), but be assured you will try a medley of authentic dishes that you may not have experienced before. Far from your typical pho, you will likely encounter other combinations of Vietnamese ingredients, sauces, and recipes that are sure to challenge and delight your taste buds. We also heartily enjoyed a Vietnamese dessert, beer, rice wine, and egg coffee along the way.Walking among traffic was not an issue due to Lotus calling out \"sticky rice!\", the effective rallying cry to band together behind her, every time we faced an intersection we needed to cross. We ended up running a bit over time, which was fine since we had nothing planned for the rest of the night, but that was more due to our enthusiasm than lack of punctuality from Lotus. Overall, definitely a memorable experience. Hope you read this Lotus--we had a lot of fun, and hope you can raise a Samoyed one day :)"

Our guide was lovely, spoke good English and we certainly got to try way too many dishes. But the whole thing felt a little generic - most places we ate were full of other groups on similar street food tours and it didn't feel like we were taken anywhere we couldn't have found ourselves.

            "review": "Food tour in old quarters . We did the tour of the street food. We showed up at noon and asked to go on tour right away. We had to wait 30min for a guide to be here. Not a problem at all. We just stayed there at the agency and asked questions to the girl behind the desk about different things we wanted to know.The COST of the tour was $30/person for the private tour. It was 3 of us. It would have been $20 with a group, and in that case the tours started later for an evening tour. I'm sure the evening tours are fun but seriously the old quarters is already a mess during the day and at night it becomes a jungle, so I preferred to do this at lunch.The tour was fun, we tasted food from 8 different places. Small enough portion each time that we could keep going for a while but it's a lot of food. All the places we went were the small little street food that you hesitate to go to because of all the warnings your get from the book guides or from your medical institutions especially in the USA... Which seriously the problem comes from the \"hygiene beyond extreme\" American mentality, not from Vietnam style of making food. If you don't live in the USA and you're not one of those clean freak then indulge.Our guide was Lotus. She was super nice like Vietnamese people seem to be in general. Beyond the food experience it was also a cultural one. It was nice to have her attention for 3 hours and listen to her way of life as a student.After this tour is like to do another tour related to food but maybe less traditional and more about what's young people today's favorite places in Hanoi to go eat. Also I would have liked to understand how she would select a place if she didn't know about it before. We failed to ask these questions.At this point, after 3 days in Hanoi though I'm a little sick of the old quarters and want to explore more of the city where the tourists don't venture much."

She showed us the places that are most popular among the locals, and we got to try 8 different dishes, all of which were new to us. We had a no seafood preference, and that was easily taken care of. We are a bit uneasy of going to street food restaurants that we do not know, so it was very nice to have a guide show us the best of these places. We enjoyed every dish very much. Since more 8 people had signed up for our tour, they divided us into two smaller groups. This was very nice, as it allowed us to get to know all the other travellers in our group. Lotus was very good at telling us about all the dishes, but also very good at letting the conversation flow whenever it started. She always used the breaks in the conversation to take us to the next stop or tell anecdotes about the food we were eating."

My wife is mostly vegetarian (but eats seafood) and we were able to work around her dietary restrictions at every stop. We had absolutely delicious food at many hole in the wall type places that I would have overlooked had I been on my own. I lost count of how many stops we made, but we finished up around 10pm and everyone was completely stuffed and fully satisfied. For the squeamish - all of the food that we ate was perfectly \"normal\" by American standards - no organ meats, blood, exotic animals, bugs, or balut or anything like that. I wish the tour company would offer an \"extreme\" food tour with all sorts of weird stuff, but still this tour was super fun, and super tasty, and my stomach felt perfectly fine the next day.

Miss Moon was a superb tour guide and gave us a great introduction to the Old Quarter and street food. She was funny, friendly, enthusiastic and informative. What to expect: Wear your walking shoes and expect to eat a lot and sit low. Most of the portions at each restaurant are just the right size and nothing we ate would be considered too unusual for a picky palate. Tell your guide if you have dietary restrictions (they worked around mine). Some of the plates are communal. Budget between 3 to 4 hours for this tour. We were able to get our tickets at the office in the same hour. Our group was eleven people total, just big enough to still feel intimate. I think any more people would have detracted from the experience.Our guide wrote up a list of all the restaurants and dishes that we ate at, so bring your camera to take a photo of it. The ONLY thing I did not like about this trip was the unique banh mi. There was too much sauce and I've honestly had better banh mi in my own country. Everything else was great, definitely do it on your first day. It's a great way to orient yourself in the Old Quarter.If you need a bathroom, there's a bathroom stop at the office. Beware that it's a steep stairway up. (You could also try at one of the restaurants.) At the end, I was full but not overstuffed."

On our 1st night in Hanoi a dinner sitting at the table next to us suggested we should have done the tour that night, our 1st night in town. He explained that it opened his eyes to places and food he otherwise would not likely have tasted. Unfortunately we took the tour on our last night, 3rd night in Hanoi, and wished we had done it on the 1st. The food we had he 1st 2 nights wasn't bad but it paled in comparison to the dishes Smile introduced us to. As their were 3 tours going out at 5pm the night we did our tour and we never ran into the other 2 tours I would presume that each tour goes to different locations. With this logic I would have gone on the food tour each night if we had gone our 1st night in Hanoi ...that's how much we enjoyed it and how good it was."

They were very nice and were able to organize the tour around what Vietnamese foods we had already tried and any specific diet requests that we had. We did the streetfood on motorbikes tour which I highly recommend as they explained about different sights and parts of the city we passed on the way, and we were able to see parts of the city that we had not seen before.Lily and Mia were great. Anytime we wanted to try something they got it for us and they actually bought us several additional items along the way, so we tried more like 11 or 12 dishes than eight. Also, along the way they changed one of our stops as we told them we had already tried bun cha hanoi style.Overall we had 8 different stops, each one having food and two of them having drinks also.The first stop we had pho bo (beef pho). Having already had pho several times, this was not incredibly interesting to me, but the pho was pretty good.The next stop we had nem bo (green papaya salad with beef). I thought this might be similar to som tam (Thai green papaya salad), but it was actually much different and tasted great. They also brought me some beef liver and fat to put on mine, although I didn't really like the fat. This was my favorite dish of the night overall.The next stop we had banh cuon (thin rice pancake with black mushrooms and pork), a traditional food for Vietnamese breakfast. They also brought us an additional dish which was egg with mugwort (I forget the name in Vietnamese), that was also very interesting.The next stop was the fried stop. We had a \"pillow\" dumpling with pork, a spring roll with crab, a fried sour nem with beef, and a donut with green bean curd. They also bought us lemon tea to drink. These were all pretty good, especially the sour nem which was delicious.Next we cruised over to the West Lake and had a small snack of bo bia. This was basically a very thin rice wrapper wrapped around shredded coconut and sugarcane. It was a light, slightly sweet snack/dessert. The next stop we tried modern takes on pho. The first was a beef and herb roll wrapped in giant pho rice noodles. These were dipped in fish sauce and were delicious. We also had a fried pho noodles with beef and morning glory, served dry (without broth), although I was not a huge fan.The next stop we had a banh mi and egg coffee with cacao. I had already eaten plenty of banh mis and this one was fairly unremarkable, although not bad. We also had a shot of rice wine which was strong, one was definitely enough. The egg coffee was alright also, but nowhere near as good as the egg coffee we had at Cafe Giang (where I would recommend going to try it).The next stop we had bun reuc (spelling?) or bun noodles with crab, fish, and pork in a beef broth. This was pretty good, although not overly remarkable.Finally dessert! We had two options - yogurt with sticky rice and caramel or fresh fruit, so we picked the yogurt option. After getting our bowls, we mixed everything together and tried it. I was surprised by how much I liked this dessert, it basically tasted like sweet yogurt with sticky rice, and a slight caramel taste. It was a fantastic ending to the night! By this time I was also super full but I still managed to finish the whole thing.I highly recommend this tour, we tried so many interesting food items and were very full by the end of the night. We also learned a lot about the city of Hanoi, got to see the city from the back of a motorbike, and got to meet two interesting locals. Definitely do this if you have any interest in learning more about Vietnamese cuisine!"

Especially when we found out our 'British' waterproof jackets must only be waterproof in England!How wrong we were - Hiem (Cherry) was our private guide for the morning and we had the best morning ever! We tried local dishes from the local families in places that you would normally walk passed and places that would almost certainly not exist in the western food hygiene obsessed world.The food was fresh, tasty and unusual. We experienced tasty dishes from 'Nom Bo Kho' (Papaya, peanuts and dried beef salad) and 'Bun Cha' (pork meat balls and rice noodles in a fish sauce, vinegar and mint broth) to a local delicacy 'Balut' (Boiled duck egg embryo). Don't panic - we only tried things we were willing to and weren't forced into anything at all. Another must try is Bo Bia (Fresh grated coconut, fresh sugar cane and sesame sweets in a rice pancake) with a lemon tea - AMAZING. Hiem was fantastic - very good English and incredibly knowledgable about Hanoi and not just the food. I couldn't recommend this tour enough and was a great start to our Vietnamese adventure as we now can recognise some great dishes on the menus!"

Let's just say I was glad to have some tonic water on hand afterwards, because you basically end up eating about 6 separate meals. If you tell your tour guide ahead of time of any dietary restrictions, they will acommodate the tour and the menu for your request. Vegetarian requests are easy- they just make the dishes without meat in them! (Wish I had known that before eating my snack).The tour lasts anywhere from 2-4 hours (depending on how chatty your group and tour guide are). You will wander the streets of the Old Quater, going from restaurants to hole-in-the-wall eateries. Your tour guide is in charge of ordering for you, and if you have one as great as ours, they will tell you the ingredients, origins, and history of the dish you are eating. They will even give you background on the people who run the eateries.If you are particularly tall or long-legged, do some yoga beforehand. Most of the places you visit have child-sized benches. It is entertaining but come prepared to fit into small, tight places.The food is fantastic, the company is usually very interesting (open minded foodies usually are), and the $25 we paid are well worth it.You end up eating 11 different dishes (some are desserts) so come prepared!"

She gave us tons of information about all the food we are and even the city. She even showed us the \"right\" way to eat everything! Miss Moon made sure to ask all food preferences right from the beginning (vegetarian, no pork, no seafood, only seafood, etc.) and remembered everyone's choice at every stop. We ended up getting much more food than initially expected and everything was SO good! Definitely make sure you go hungry!! Our group can usually eat a lot of food and we were all very full by the end!

He didn't only take us around to eat good street food but he explained to us what we were eating and what it was made out of. When we got to certain food stands, he would have us participate in the cooking process which was great. He made sure that he interacted and learned how things were cooked. Sea also brought us around to the old quarter and showed us how a typical apartment in Hanoi looks like. It was definitely more than a street food tour which is why this tour was extremely great. At the end of the tour, Sea invited all of us to his village the next day and I took his offer. Sea brought me to his village and I was able to hang out with him and his friends for the next few days. I wasn't sure what to expect when I arrived in Hanoi. Luckily, I stumbled across the street food tour and managed to not only eat tons of great street food but also make some new friends.

We ate alongside locals on the sidewalk but always felt safe that we were eating food that would not make us sick. I highly recommend this as an introduction to Vietnamese culture and food (not to mention as a way to have the most interesting dinner you'll have in Hanoi!)."

We already ate everything that moved for 2 weeks so we didn't get a lot of new things, but the quality of the food was good. Food wise the egg coffee is a must have in Hanoi. Also we liked the bicycle guy with his coconut wrap. Linh is an excellent guide. I especially liked that she took us into one of the alleys and showed us how the less fortunate families have to live the Hanoi hustle."

They take the guess work out of which places are authentic, clean and legit. They've done the research so you don't have to or get lost searching for a place. Our local guide, Sea was passionate about showing us the best fare in Hanoi, and taught us about local life and answered any questions we had. He was very funny and accommodating, making sure all the guests were happy. He was a super star, tour guide. After the tour, a few of us on the tour grabbed drinks in one of those busy alleys, squatting on those tiny stools with $25 cent beers. This tour was an experience we enjoyed on many levels!"

You stroll around the Old Quarter from eatery to eatery with a maximum of 10/12 people, and you taste several very good dishes. The guide we had, Cherry, was simply wonderful, you can tell she loves her job and she is very good in sharing her knowledge with her guests. I don't eat meat and she could arrange very good alternatives for me. She was also very good in creating a good and relaxed atmosphere. The price was really reasonable and it was worth every dollar."

We decided to do the Hanoi Street Food Tour partly because it had been recommended to me and also due to the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. As there were four of us, the company recommended and arranged a private tour for us. Our guide was personable and friendly, however, we do not feel she really went out her way to cater to our tastes considering it was a private tour. My mother is not fond of pork or egg and although, we appreciate these are very common ingredients in Vietnamese cooking rather than trying to limit the number of dishes with these ingredients most things we ate had pork and/or egg in it. This wouldn't have been a big issue except our guide took the time at the beginning of the tour to find out if we had any food preferences or allergies but never really catered to them despite taking the time to find out what they are. Also we felt the tour was a little overpriced for what we got. There were a lot of dishes that were very similar and for $25 per person for a private tour you expect a little bit more diversity and for your preferences or interests to be catered to. This tour did have its redeeming features though, our guide was very informative and we learnt a lot about Hanoi and Vietnamese cuisine. We enjoyed the tour but I think it just needs a little more attention to detail to make it a great tour."

Then the man disappeared, telling us he'd meet us at our destination! What a very odd way to start what was going to be three fantastic hours!But after a five minutes drive through a bustling city we had never set foot in, we did reach our destination and our man was there to open the taxi door for us (did he use teleportation or one of the millions of scooter in town, we will never know!).Hien/Cherry was our guide for the evening. Wonderful young woman who seemed to really love her city and the food she made us try on the evening. We had eight different stops all around the Old Quarter. From Bun cha via Banh mi,spring rolls, crab soup, coconut and sesame sweet, we tasted some truly wonderful food.We ended up our walk drinking an egg chocolate drink ( we are not coffee drinkers) and a delicious ginger tea.

On the other hand our guide, Kiwi, is superb. She socially intelligent at her age (just graduated university). She knows when to talk and when to let us talk.

Sure, $20 sounds \"expensive\" for dinner in Hanoi, but what you're really paying for is the luxury of not needing to know where you're going and of not having to worry and of knowing that the food you'll be eating will be DELICIOUS!!! The other thing you pay $20 for is learning how to cross the street. Our lovely guide Hien instructed us that she would say \"sticky rice!!!\" and then we would all cross as a pack. After doing that a few times, crossing the street seemed much less scary. One interesting experience from our tour was when we came to one of the stops and found that there wasn't enough space for us in the normal area - so we went up some stairs and ended up having that food (spring rolls, salty donuts, and something else fried) in the family kitchen. You truly feel like they are taking care of you. Also the egg coffee was yummy! Highly recommended!A tip: I took pictures of the food from each stop and something indicating what it was called (menu, sign, etc.) on my phone with the geo tag so that we could find our way back later."

Perhaps our favorite thing about this tour is that each guide is allowed to pick their favorite vendors (each is checked for cleanliness according to their site). This meant we got to try Lotus' favorite spots and hear why she enjoys them. We tried nine different spots. Each was great for different reasons, but the best part was the stories Lotus told us. We tried Bun Cha, Green Papaya Salad, Bahn Mi, Fried Spring Rolls, Beef Pho, Lemon Tea, Egg Coffee, Fried Bananas, and several more. Lotus even got us to try dried eel (she told us this is the one food she does not like, so I felt I had to accept the challenge...it wasn't bad). My favorite dish was the beef pho (well done and half cooked) from the stand Lotus goes to with her mom and dad each Sunday. The pho was so good we went back the next night. My wife's favorite was the egg coffee at the end. We also made a return trip to that shop. I agree with some others who posted that it would be great to learn a bit more about the history of the dishes, but in the end that really isn't that important on this type of tour, especially when you are getting the personal history from the guide."

Her dedication to offering us something we haven't yet had and to showing us where/how the locals eat really made the night memorable. Sitting on tiny stools, my husband's 6'2 physique looked particularly amusing - always a bonus! Other than Lotus, it was, of course, the food that really made an impression. From the legendary Pho place we visited, to trying my hand at rolling a Ban Cuon (total fail on my part), to sipping some tea and crunching some sunflower seeds with the youth of Hanoi, to stopping into a desert place and having Lotus' special mix made for us (delicious!), I cannot recommend the entire experience enough. It's not a small amount of food, so eat light that day.

She was really a lot of fun and also gave us a lot of interesting details about Vietnam and Hanoi. This tour is a must-do in Hanoi!"

Our guide, Sea, took us to places with some incredibly tasty food which we would've never otherwise discovered (either easily missed on the street or rather difficult to convince yourself to eat there as a Western visitor). Everything was perfect, great value - 5/5, I still have dreams about that food and egg coffee! :)"

(1) Prefer the day tour because you shouldn't take heavy dinner. (2) Either skip the previous meal or have it well in advance or you would not be able to appreciate everything to the extent it deserves. (3) Your guide would take you to 6-7 different stalls so keep that in mind and eat little amounts of everything. (4) Ask your guide for longer walks between the meals, you would be able to explore more of old quarter and easily digest whatever you eat. (5) And lastly, don't think about the bike tours, walking tours are cheap and best."

My buddy and I decided on a lunch time session and we were lucky to get the ever so cheerful Miss Moon!! Miss Moon was a joy to follow around as she radiated an enthusiasm that would make you think you were the first and only group she had ever led around. We made sure to skip breakfast that morning as I wanted to enjoy every dish on offer and I am so glad I did. There was quite a bit of food to sample. Miss Moon also made sure those with any special dietary requirements were fully catered for. In fact, I was jealous of my vegetarian friends alternative dishes on many occasions! As a result of this great experience, we managed to re-visit quite a few eateries to enjoy our favourite dishes a few more times. I mean, who would know about where to get such great egg coffee and fresh draught beer for NZD$0.30!!"

I wish we would have done this towards the beginning of our stay versus the end, because we stopped at so many places and tried so many things that I would have loved to have again. We enjoyed the Bum Bo Nam Bo so much, we went back to get it again late that night for dinner.Our guide was Lotus and she was so helpful and informative along the way. Be prepared, you will not go home hungry on this tour. Honestly, there is probably too much food but without so many dishes, we wouldn't have tried so many things. I would suggest sharing some of the dishes with someone else if you can so you have room by the end. Can you tell I'm trying to emphasize how much food you eat?!A food tour like this would cost double the price in the states. It's really a great bargain and introduces you to dishes you probably wouldn't have tried without know what they were first. And now I'll feel more comfortable ordering Vietnamese dishes when I go to restaurants here in the US."

We had banh my, bun cha, banh cuon, bo bia, assorted fried dumplings/spring rolls, egg coffee, papaya salad and a fruity dessert. One thing is for certain - we were stuffed! What was really lacking on this tour was more in-depth information on the origins of each dish, how they vary from region, and general historical context of the neighborhood / Old Quarter / Hanoi. Hien knew answers to pointed questions, but did not really give information unless prompted. If you want someone to lead you by the hand and order food for you, then this tour is for you. If you'd like a side a history/background with your pho, then perhaps a different tour would be better."

The tour is well run, perfectly organized and great effort has been expended to find the top vendors. Our tour guide Moon was efficient, knowledgeable, genuinely interested in our safety and satisfaction. She taught us all the ingredients, showed us how to eat the various dishes and answered every single question our group had. To fully engage with this countries cuisine having a guide take you on the culinary journey through the old town makes it worth every penny of the affordable 20 dollar tour. You will not walk away hungry and you will have tried some of the best offerings and a variety of sweet and savory dishes. Hands down one of the best tours I've taken! Thanks Moon!

We were drinking at bier corner and drinking egg coffee at 10:00pm and didn't want to leave. This tour is a 'must do' for anyone in Hanoi."

Got into town around 6PM and immediately headed over to sign up for the food tour. Glad I did. It's a great way to orient yourself with the city, try the local dishes, and meet people. Pi was our guide and she did a great job taking us to the spots in the Old quarter totally taking care of the group. She described the ingredients in the dishes, how they're prepared, and how to eat them (sauces). I often eat Vietnamese food when I'm back home, but the tour managed to introduce me to new dishes that I didn't know about. Even if I found these places on my own, I probably wouldn't know to order some of the dishes because there aren't any pictures on any of the menus. A nice introduction to Hanoi. Highly recommended."

Besides the planned food tour stops we were able to try our hand at making rice paper wraps, we bought food from street vendors and we got to experience the bustling street life in Hanoi's Old Quarter.From noodle dishes to desserts, fruit and spring rolls - we tried so much. No problem accommodating a vegetarian either, the substitutions were fabulous. I can't stop thinking about the Bo Bia - if I could travel back to Hanoi just to eat more from the street vendors I would.Thanks for the great Hanoi experience!"

She also demonstrated how to mix various sauces and herbs into the meal to enhance the flavour. The tour was about 3 hrs long. The food was delicious and plentiful. In addition learning about food we walked through the jumble of streets in the Old Quarter and the French Quarter and became more comfortable with crossing the streets. Food and drink are all included in the price. The tour ended with beers at 'beer corner'. After Miss Moon said goodbye, the group remained seated on the tiny stools in front of the bar soaking in the sights and swapping travel stories over more beers. We definitely got a very authentic and fun experience."

Had a fantastic night with Cheryl and Li Li who are best friends. Thus, with such buddies to bring you around means more fun. We tried many food and drinks but my friend was not feeling well. Cheryl and Li Li, in my opinion, got a shocked when my friend vomited. They thought she was not used to the food they had introduced so far during the trip. But rest assure, my friend was not well due to indigestion from the previous meals. I guessed they were really young and perhaps, first time encountering such situation that we had to reassure them that it was not their 'fault'. So they decided to bring us around to Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, west lake, red river by their scooter. It was always fun to be on a bike in Vietnam. Like they say, while in Rome, do as Romans do. so while in Vietnam, ride as Vietnamese ride. It was totally different being a pedestrian and a passenger on the bike. Though it was 'scary' at first, you will slowly be enjoying the breeze and view as Cheryl and Li Li are great riders. Along the way, they will introduce the country and provided information of the architectures. It was really informative. Will we try this again, yes, of course. But well, I guess, perhaps it will be better if the price for private tour can be lower!"

It's not an easy area to navigate and it's even harder to find the 'best of' foods when many places seem to serve the same types of dishes. For these reasons, the street food tour is a must-do if you're a foodie and want to explore the area without consulting a map every five minutes. Our guide, Sea, a bubbly 21 year old, was eager to show off his beautiful country and it's wonderful cuisine. He took us to seven or eight places, serving such things as Bun Cha (roasted pork with noodles), banh mi sandwiches, egg coffee, and my personal favorite, bo bia, a shaved coconut and sugar cane concoction. At each stop, Sea explained the significance of each dish, how it is prepared, and the best method of eating it. You will definitely have a better appreciation for the street food culture and the unique dishes the area has to offer when you have someone with you who speaks the language and knows what they're doing. My wife and I had a wonderful night and we'd highly recommend taking the tour."

We brought along our three kids (ages 14, 12 and 8), the two younger ones are very picky eaters and really didn't try much but the remaining three of us could have done this tour several times a week and not tire of the experience. Advice:1) Ask for Miss Moon as your guide, she was simply incredible with her stories and guiding2) Eat little if anything in the hours before this tour, you will make up for it with all the tasting along the way3) Bring good walking shoes, you will cover sever kilometers easy on the walking tour4) Bring a good camera and if you have a good zoom lens then keep it nearby, there are so many great chances to photograph all the zaniness that makes Hanoi so endearing5) Remember that you are taking a street food tour, you will be sitting in some places that you would probably never venture into on your own, that's the whole point of taking a guided tour that pushes you beyond your comfort zone!Bathroom facilities are available along the way, but they are tucked into nondescript and random points. This is not a good tour if you have difficulty navigating sidewalks and uneven terrain, it is the old town after all. If you have a baby in tow, wear a baby-backpak; old town Hanoi is just not a good place to navigate with a stroller."

I was only disappointed that the level of English was a below expectation however the owner of the company has since been in touch and we have even met since the tour and he has more than adequately compensated for this. Very professional approach. Lovely individuals and the good will is second to none. A great introduction to Hanoi and Vietnamese food! Do it as early on as you can - just email them as soon as you know your arrival dates so you can book via email.Thanks Mr Nguyen for your quick and timely responses to my emails to book and your very professional folllow-up to my comments/feedback.... most appreciated!"

Went on the tour on Christmas day as a fun treat instead of the dinner at home.The tour said on its website and in emails that the tour would be 6-10 people max but 15 showed up and all were taken on it.This meant that our tour guide (the excellent cherry) found it difficult to describe the dishes to everyone and the food stalls couldn't get everyone served at the same time. Many would have finished before some were served. Also, it was difficult to get talking to everyone over the night.There wasn't that much food included but the fantastic cherry brought us to an extra restaurant after and we chatted for over an hour.The tour should not have gone with so many people and should have split the group up - it seems money took over. The tour itself follows the recommended eating spots in the lonely planet guide.I rate the tour 1 star but cherry 5 stars."

The food stops were wonderful and I loved the contrast in the different foods, one minute we were eating warming soups, then cool crunchy & fresh foods and then sweet and sticky...so fabulous. A couple of times we made random stops and Miss Moon bought extra foods we were interested in, or from a mobile vendor that she happened to see. I never would have known how to find or order these foods by myself. This is the food I came here to experience, it really was an outstanding tour and so moderately priced compared to other food tours I have done."

Some came with traditional backgrounds & history, some were just simple dishes but tasted extra-ordinarily . We hereby wish to thank Ms Moon for that wonderful 3 hours spent together..introducing the Hanoi specialities , the best place for the best food & Vietnam culture that we were initially unfamiliar with, we would like to recommend Ms Moon to all potential Hanoi visitors .. & we are confident your trip would be a fruitful one.. being in the good hands of Ms Moon.

There was just so much - it was a good idea to only have a small breakfast that day! The walks are not too long between stops, and the quality of the food is so high and it differs between each shop. The highlight for us was the egg coffee at the end - worth hanging around for! 'Sunshine' was a sweet and well spoken tour guide. She was able to give us information about not only the food and the city of Hanoi, but also about other Vietnamese traditions which was very interesting! I cannot recommend this trip more strongly.

There are numerous articles about how wonderful street food is in Viet-Nam, but there are just as many articles about unsanitary conditions leading to traveler's diarrhea. Then a friend mentioned this outfit which not only guarantees good hygiene but is also well rated on Trip Advisor. 9 out of 12 of us took the plunge and, to the dismay of the 3 scaredy cats who stayed in, it turned out to be the top eating experience from our entire 3-week trip in Viet-Nam. Hien, who also goes by Cherry, quickly won us over with her spunk, passion and attentiveness. And the food, at every single stop, is fabulous. We were introduced to a large spectrum of Hanoi delicacies. We ate from sidewalk stoops. We ate from tiny mom-and-pop shops. We ate standing in the street from a box in the back of a bicycle. We drank \"egg coffee\" from a lounge tucked away at the end of a dark alley. And, as Hien had promised, we did not go home hungry. We were so stuffed, we skipped the last stop. Next time, I'll make sure not to eat so much at lunch.Hien, thank you for an unforgettable evening. The food was absolutely delicious, and your passion made it exceptional. In your honor, we still yell out \"sticky rice!\" whenever we cross the streets.Note: If you want to book this, make sure you talk to them directly, and insist on it. When I mentioned it to our tour company, they tried to sign us up on their own tour. When I asked our hotel to make the arrangements, they tried to get us on their partner's tour."

In particular, I told Miss Moon when I booked the tour that I was a vegetarian, and she ensured that I was given vegetarian substitutes at every single stop. We were given seven unbelievable courses of Hanoi's best street food, including wrapping up the tour with a visit to Hanoi's best coffee house for some egg coffee.Overall, I would highly recommend this tour. Doing the lunchtime tour allows you to really experience some of the impressive French colonial architecture the old quarter has to offer.

My only criticism is that we walked a very long way sometimes it felt like taking the long way around just for the sake of it. It meant the tour took 3.5 hours in total with 6 stops for food. The food itself taking less than an hour. It started with a tiny baguette with p\u00e2t\u00e9, then some fruit from the night market, rice pancakes, BBQ street food (the very best place on Hang Bong!), fruit with condensed milk and then Vietnamese egg coffee.

There is more food on the tour that one can eat :) Although you are eating on the streets, have no fear, we were both absolutely fine after eating everything.The walk around the old quarter is also great to get your bearings on what would otherwise be an absolute maze!The tour is really a must do in Hanoi!"

Though we weren't shy of trying the local food beforehand, this is a great way of eating 'local' if you don't know where to go to, or afraid to try at the small streetfood shops. Our guide Lan Anh (Kiwi) was very chearfull, and besides being very knowledgable about the food she also shared alot about the vietnamese culture. Beware there is lots of food - so be hungry! :)"

Sea took us to several different places we would have just walked past had we been on our own and he explained a lot about what we were eating and also about the culture here in Hanoi. We had a great evening and would recommend this tour to everyone"

We were joined by 6 other fellow travellers, and we got on really well, super fast. Our tour guide was Amy. You must ask for her if you can. She was enthusiastic, bubbly, knowledgeable friendly and funny!! She lead us across the crazy streets of Hanoi telling us to stick together like \"sticky rice!\" We tried bun cha, pho, rice crepes, fried cakes (spring rolls and the like), sugar cane drink, bbq skewers, sweet dessert & the piece de resistance-egg coffee. You must definitely not miss out on this amazing coffee. All the food was from Amy's favourite places & they were all delicious! Great to eat at places with the locals. Best to go on this tour with a good appetite or else you will really miss out. It was a fun & educational street food tour. Sad to say farewell to our new friends! C'am o'n Amy!!!"

It was the best decision of our trip to Vietnam. For first-time visitors from the west, Hanoi's chaotic Old Quarter seems unapproachable. Even crossing the street in the face of a tidal wave of oncoming motorbikes is a challenge, let alone deciding where to--and not to--eat! My daughter and I booked a 3-hour private tour with Hanoi Street Food Tour on our first morning in the city. Over the next three hours, our lovely guide, Hien (whose English is excellent), showed us so much more than the world's best street food. Yes, we ate 7 different and uniformly exceptional dishes at food stalls--what pass as restaurants in the Old Quarter--that we wouldn't have dared enter on our own. Yes, we strolled the narrow, hectic alleyways that are the Old Quarter's grocery, with all manner of fresh vegetables, fruits, meats (dead and alive), and yes, insects, for sale. But beyond this, Hien gave us an invaluable cultural tour of old Hanoi, explaining the \"logic\" of its street layout, its history, and how today's crumbling relic of Hanoi's colonial past meshes with Vietnam's emerging modern economy. We couldn't have had a better introduction to this dizzy, fascinating city. If you go, take lots of photos of where you eat. You'll want to find your way back for more, and you won't be able to do it without a trail of bread crumbs."

To begin I'd like to start by saying the only regret was that I did the food tour on the last night of my stay in Hanoi when I should have done it the night I arrived. But in saying that, I wouldn't have met the great people and shared with them the best night of the whole trip. I stayed in the old quarter and this tour really finds your bearings of the city and its bustling streets.Our guides name was Sea (as his parents named him after conceiving him on their honeymoon) and he was such a great host. Very funny, very interested in you as a person and as a whole group. There were 10 of us on the tour, all strangers and Sea straight away got us to introduce ourselves to the group and we all bonded very quickly.The tour takes you to many local eateries on corner streets, down dark alleys, places you wouldn't usually dare to enter. Usually each guide has his/her favourite spots that they frequent with their own friends. The dishes I tried were all great. I especially loved the pho chicken noodle soup, and the egg coffee! Beer corner was a fantastic way to mingle with the group and locals, and after the tour was over we all walked straight back and kept the night going. For 5000 dong per beer ( about 0.26 cents au) a shout for the group with a few rounds cost $6. A quick tip the beer runs out as a keg only lasts 24 hours. We closed 2 restaurants that night so you just keep moving on.To finish up, the street food tour is something you must experience. Do it on your first night and you'll learn a lot about the city from your guide. I'll do it every time I visit!"

Starting with the most obvious reason for taking a street food tour, the food is terrific. Moving on to the next most obvious benefit of doing something like this, our guide (Cherry) was great - informative and friendly and spoke good English. However, I think the most important reason to take this tour is actually that it's a perfect way to see Hanoi's old quarter, and a perfect way to adjust to the hectic nature of the place. You find yourself eating in little local caf\u00e9s and restaurants which, without the benefit of a guide, you might never have ventured into, still less known what to order. Plus, we found that following a guide around the streets took the stress out of walking round Hanoi - all of a sudden you're no longer concerned about getting lost and you're significantly less worried about being mown down by one of the 10,000 motor bikes on every street! After the tour we felt more comfortable and relaxed for the remainder of our time in Hanoi. I would recommend that anyone going to Hanoi for a number of days do this tour on their first or second night - it's the perfect way to see what a great city Hanoi is!"

He gave an insight into Vietnamese culture, encouraged trying but didn't enforce and I was so full at the end, but wanted to do it all again.

Got a close-up look at the Old Quarter and sampled a lot of street food at places that, on our first night, we may have been a little hesitant about. Had a small group with just three other people-all interesting. Our guide, Lan Anh, aka Kiwi, is delightful. In addition to explaining the food and a bit about the culture, she was terrific in telling us about the life of a younger person in Vietnam today. All of the places we ate at were full of Vietnamese and not tourists. We ended the evening at a coffee place that we would have never have found on our own. The entrance was just a long hallway. But when you walked in a ways and then went upstairs, it was a busy, fun place full of locals. I highly recommend this tour and I especially recommend trying to get Kiwi. She will ensure a very pleasant experience."

We continued throughout the Old Quarter to several more stalls and enjoyed many delicious meals. A personal favourite was the Banh Cuon, rice flour pancakes filled with pork and mushroom, served with fresh herbs and a tasty dipping sauce. Our last stop was for an egg coffee which could be compared to an iced coffee, but far more delicious. We had a private tour and our guide Anh (aka Sunshine) was a delight to spend a few hours with. She was bright and bubbly and gave us a great insight not only to the local street food, but also local culture. As it is so busy, noisy and crowded in the Old Quarter it is worth paying the extra money to have a private tour, it would not have been the same with a larger group."

And we were given savoury food then ice cream then savoury again so our pellets were very confused. This was not value for money at $60US our guide was very polite however and did her best .

Great way to eat the best Vietnamese hawker food, like the Vietnamese !By ourselves, we would not have known which stalls to visit, nor would we have chosen to sit in these small stools by the roadside. We did not have to worry too much about food poisoning, safety or being hassled to buy anything.Tour operator was late picking us up from the hotel. However, they sent 2 scooters to pick 3 of us up. Thus, we had an unexpected chance to ride a scooter on Hanoi streets - too bad it was such a short trip.The walking tour was great, though I felt we should have visited 1 or 2 more food stalls in the tour. The majority of the tour was spent on drink stalls to fill us up. For those of us who do not drink alcohol, we finished the tour not quite full. Overall it was a good introduction to Vietnamese food & drinks.We took the tour on our first night. We visited a number of streets on Old Quarter - their shopping belt and also where most of their good food is located. That was a good decision as we learnt some important things.We learned how to cross Hanoi streets, a must-learn if you want to go anywhere on your own : stick out your hand to let vehicles know you want to cross and keep walking slowly. Don't stop to wait for the vehicles to give way to you - it will not happen.SEA, our English-speaking guide was most obliging. He went out of his way to help his tourists buy emergency items on the way, acting as interpreter. As a result, our tour ended late. His office was closed. However, since they promised to send us, 3 ladies, safely back to our hotel, SEA took it upon himself to walk us back. He missed his bus home and had to take a taxi and pay out of his own pocket. His dedication is highly commendable.We were charged USD20 each for the food tour. Though some felt this is expensive given the fact that the items we consumed were very cheap, I felt it was acceptable as we would otherwise not have had a chance to sample so many good dishes on our own given our limited time in Hanoi/Vietnam. I recommend this tour to anyone who have a few hours to spare, want to see where Vietnamese people go to eat and want to try great Vietnamese food, but don't know where to go !"

This was a great insight into how the local people go out and everyone was very hospitable.The food is fantastic and you can get places that you like marked on your map so that you can visit again.

It was also a really nice way to meet other random tourists and enjoy an evening in little hole in the wall restaurants or sitting on little plastic stools in the middle of sidewalks.

Before we left for Hanoi for a 9-day holiday trip, I told my friend Raymond, about a boiled egg called balut that I had taken in Cambodia a few years ago. It is an egg that has a young developing chick or duck embryo that is boiled alive and taken in or out the shell . We were scouring all over the streets until the last tow days before we leave that we found a woman carrying two baskets on the shoulder selling the eggs. Raymond was hesitating and squirming trying to eat it when a a friendly passerby took a piece of aromatic vegetable, some spices from the seller woman's basket and add into the balut for him to eat. He gave up half way and I finished the rest for him !!. It is really tasty with the spices. It is a delicacy, beside Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos And Philippines You know what : when we were waiting for the airport taxi at about 6 am just outside Hotel Rendezvous Hang Dieu Street, we saw a group of elderly women having balut for breakfast!! One egg costs only 50 cents USD"

We decided the street food tour might be a great way to meet the local people and sample the authentic food, but not only did we do that, our guide was also knowledgeable, spoke really good English and most of all was a really good companion for the night. Sea was interesting and funny, and he explained every dish we sampled in detail, and showed us what to add to it and how to eat it. Our favourite part was sitting on the street drinking fresh beer with our Australian & Canadian companions, watching the world go by and toasting each other (in Vietnamese). Sea also explained a lot about the culture in Vietnam, the customs and most importantly, got me the best coffee of my life to finish with -a hot egg coffee. If you don't try that, you don't know what you're missing! A great night out, great introduction to a beautiful country. Thanks so much Sea...would recommend you to anybody."

All the food/drink was delicious and I was very full afterwards. Walking around Hanoi the following day I easily located the places we stopped at on the tour. We booked the 8pm water puppet show as part of the tour; however, the tour ended just after 8pm and we needed to make our own way to the theatre which was 5-10 minute walk. This made us late to the show. I highly recommend this tour, but I suggest booking the water puppet show separately."

Many places were small street stalls that we may have walked past and not noticed or been brave enough to try but with Miss Moon we tried all kinds of great things. She explained how to add your toppings and described all the ingredients. She was also very helpful when our group stopped at a fruit stand and wanted to know about the different fruits even though this was not a planned stop.

We had our 14 year old daughter with us and she loved it too and tried everything!!Miss Moon had the eight of us crossing the busy streets of old town Hanoi like \"sticky rice\" - all close together and safe. We tried all sorts of local specialities - like pho with crab meat, pillow cakes and sea crab nem (or sausages), banh khuc (sticky rice filled with mung bean paste, pork, and spices), the most delicious pork spring rolls ever, and fresh fruit in coconut milk. Our favourite was probably the bun can - a fabulous broth with noodles and pork pieces as well as pork patties, greens and (by choice) a good helping of chilli\u2026 \"Nong lam\" (delicious!!!)The great thing was we sat down on stools with the locals and ate their food with them at different eateries over town. The cost of this type of street food is minimal. Miss Moon also took us for a \"fresh beer\" - rice beer made that day. It's about 3% alcohol, and incredibly refreshing, even if you don't like beer. While we had our second beer (everything was included in the cost) Miss Moon nipped home and came back with a special treat for us - local rice wine (a bit like sake). It certainly made an impact!The tour showed us around Hanoi, and taught us about street names and prefixes. By the end we felt confident not only eating local food on stools on the street, but had some favourites we could ask for, or knew where to get! We finished the tour with a local speciality at a fabulous bar - egg coffee (C\u00e0 Ph\u00ea Tr\u1ee9ng)! Vietnamese coffee mixed with egg yolk at Cafe Giang, 39 Nguyen Huu Huan street, in the Old Quarter! I won't be trying it at home folks, but it was a great experience and perfect for the tour. We had a lot of fun, learned heaps and met some really nice people. You really couldn't ask for more. Do the tour on your first day in Hanoi so you know where to go and what to eat with total confidence."

The streets of Hanoi are a little crazy - motor scooters everywhere and traffic signals that don't actually control traffic. So walking through the old quarter in a group feels marginally safer than trying to go it alone. We visited perhaps 8-10 different street vendors and all of the dishes were superb (although you have to be a fan of Vietnamese food). Later during our stay in Hanoi we went back to the old quarter and selected places to eat at random - not one of them was as good as the spots on this tour. Miss Moon, our guide, was very upbeat, and the other 4 tour participants were all really interesting people. I definitely recommend this activity. Pro tip: Come hungry and don't finish every dish early on to save room for more."

Great to spend 3 hours with such a charming Hanoi local and have so many of our questions answered - in addition of course to the primary purpose of the tour which was to guide us through the myriad street food venues. My recommendation would be to take this tour early in your Hanoi stay as it gives you the confidence to eat in so many places you would otherwise just past by.In short, an absolutely excellent tour and great thanks to Money for being so helpful and making the tour so very entertaining and worthwhile!"

We ate at places we would not have been willing to risk on our own, met the owners and 'chefs' and ate the most delicious food. Miss Moon is a sterling advertisement for her company - smiling, friendly, very knowledgeable, helped us with purchase of souvenirs and clothing, and shared a lot of history and culture. We also learned how to cross the road in Hanoi! 'Sticky Rice' (stay close) and Miss Moon's protective hand waggle which somehow slowed traffic! I especially enjoyed the fact there were only four of us on the tour. A five star tour which should not be missed! Thank you so much Miss Moon, and Brian and Jan from Melbourne who joined us.

We'd booked this tour for our very first evening and couldn't have asked for a better start to our vacation!The tour operators picked us up from our hotel and took us to their office to complete payments etc.. On mopeds! Our immediate immersion into surviving 2 wheelers in Hanoi! :) We then met our guide for the evening, 'Sea' and our gastronomic adventure took off..Firstly, the food was incredible. I could use a whole lot of adjectives here, but I know all other reviews have covered that, hence :) We went to about 7 eateries, all lil street joints. After each place we swore we couldn't eat another bite, but we still finished off plates at the next. :) I've noticed a few reviews mentioning the lack of a dessert stop.. So we realised early enuf Vietnamese don't really eat too many sweets per se, but we were taken to this place that served cut tropical fruits with some condensed milk and ice.. Seems plain enuf, but it was yum! I finished off 2 bowls by myself (and I think this was stop #6) :D We finished with the much written off egg coffee and it did not disappoint! A few friends of mine were a lil sceptical of this, but sure enuf converted after the first sip.The food covered, our guide, Sea, was amazing. He was friendly, knowledgeable about the food and eager to converse. Not only did he take us to try awesome food, he helped us orient ourselves to Hanoi itself! Helped us get a good deal on SIM cards, showed us some stops of interest and best of all, helped us get some good deals on shopping stops we made! :) The shopping bit wasn't really planned, just us walking into stores that looked interesting. He was soo patient, no matter the fact that it ended up extending our tour by almost an hour and a half. :) Also, I ended up leaving behind a packet of something I bought at one of the eateries and Sea immediately coordinated with colleagues of his and had it picked up and delivered to us where we were! That was awesome! Thanks again Sea! :)Do book yourselves on this tour. We paid $20 pp, and that seems expensive, given how cheap food in Hanoi is.. But the experience made it more than worthwhile!"

I was disappointed that there was no desert food stop because I know it's a thing in Hanoi. I was not a fan of the sugar cane juice and neither was anyone else in the group. That should be cut from the tour. Other than that the guide was super friendly and the overall experience was cool. "

I would recommend this tour to anyone, as the food is delicious and you probably would have a hard time ordering and eating in the places that are not meant for tourist if you're not fluent in vietnamese."

What better way to discover a city and culture, then through it's food. Our guide Amy was very well informed, and explained to us about each and every dish that we tried. Everything was honestly superbly delicious, and it was great to see it from a local's eyes! Our favourite's would have to be the rice noodle dumpling with shrimp inside, and the egg coffee!! OMG one of the best coffee's ever! It was hidden in a hole in the wall place and if it weren't for Amy, we would never know it existed. Amy was also very sweet and caring, as my mum has a knee disability which makes walking difficult for her, and Amy graciously held her hand and kept her supported when we walked to every stop. She was also very much part of the wonderful experience we had. I'd highly recommend this food journey to anyone that visits Hanoi! An absolute must. However, eat a light lunch and be prepared to feel like a stuffed turkey but it's well worth the food coma after."

We didn't realise you could eat so well and so cheaply (being a bit afraid of trying a random place before this tour). Our guide, Lotus, was friendly and knowledgable about the food and Hanoi in general. Our favourite things were the egg coffee (try it cold- amazing!), the selection of little fried savoury pastries, and the bo bia- a sugar cane sweet that Lotus ran after a guy on a moped to buy for us. I would definitely suggest doing the tour- it's a very fun 3 hours. 20 dollars well spent."

We went to small corner eateries, we ate from a street vendor, we went to an amazing coffee shop that you'd never find on your own and had great coffee whilst enjoying the best view of Hanoi at night, we walked through markets, and even tried silkworms, and yes they were yummy.

We were a small group of 5 which meant that our enthusiastic guide Amy could easily speak to us all at once as we crowded around a low table on even lower plastic stools! She kept us well fed and watered throughout the evening and was a fount of knowledge about both the food and the city. We were able to ask her any questions we had about the people and the culture and she encouraged us to try foods we would not have sampled alone. Her cries of 'Sticky rice' helped us cross the roads with a little more confidence than usual.

We visited 8 different places and tried foods such as bun cha, sticky rice ice cream (kem com), bahn cohn (rice pancakes), sugar cane juice, salty donuts, egg coffee and more!

The last stop was for egg coffee, which was thick, creamy, sweet, like a coffee mousse and surprisingly moreish, the egg beer...? Well, I will let you decide. Kiwi was fantastic, we learned a lot from her. We did this on the day we arrived, the best decision we made. We went back to the roll pancake stall alone and ate some more the next day.

We'd have been much more confident about trying street food if we'd done this when we first arrived, but even so, it was very enjoyable and worthwhile.Our guide (Miss Moon) was delightful - her English was great, she had lots of interesting things to say, and she took very good care of us (carefully chaperoning my hulking sons and me across the busy roads, even though she was half our size).I was surprised how much ground we covered; in the end we visited 9 different places spread all over the old quarter, sampling a great variety of food and drink."

I enjoyed the authenticity of the food and the tour guide was good. Some of the food I did not enjoy however this is probably more a reflection on my taste rather than the quality of the food, I generally have not enjoyed a lot of the food in Vietnam. The egg coffee however was awesome and easily my favourite part of the tour. It was a good way to see the old quarter. 4 stars from me. My partner was disappointed that there was no stand out dish that was very enjoyable for dinner. Like me she enjoyed the experience and the tour guide was very good, she also enjoyed seeing the town however disliked most of the food apart from the coffee, going as far as to say she was put off and reluctant to eat any Vietnamese food for the rest of our time here. 3 stars from her."

The restaurants/cafes all offered something different to try, and gave us the opportunty to eat at places where we probably would have missed. Hien was very informative about the history of Hanoi and the food along with telling us a lot about Vietnamese customs & traditions. We ended the evening with coffee from a hidden coffee house, that we failed to find again on our own!!It was a great evening and I'd definitely recommend this tour."

Most of the venues were in the old quarter. Our guides were informative and lots of fun and spoke excellent English.

She was the source of amusement for everyone in the group. Love the reference to 'sticky rice' which meant everyone should stick together in the group like sticky rice. The difference between a good tour and great tour is the quality of the tour guide and how adaptable and gracious they are to the guests. Miss Moon is all that. Our group would definitely sign up to go on this again. Nobody got sick eating the food."

Our tour guide, Ms. Moon, was sweet, knowledgeable and enthusiastic, taking us to one place after another to experience lots of tasty food. She would often give a history of the food and break down all of the various ingredients, as well as giving general observations about both Hanoi and Vietnam. I don't consider ourselves \"foodies\" and my wife is actually not a big fan of Asian cuisine in general, but both of us had a great time and liked all of the food. My recommendation: come hungry!

Reasons why this is a great thing to do:1) It will get you out of bed in the morning; Hanoi is not a place to be lying in bed wasting the day2) You'll see parts of the city you may not otherwise venture to3) You'll learn about Hanoi, the people, the districts etc. a much better experience than trying to learn from guide books4) You'll try foods you wouldn't (don't kid yourself) otherwise in cafes, restaurants you wouldn't go in5) Coffee made with egg - yep!6) You'll meet some interesting people; amazing who turns up in Vietnam on a food tour - not necessarily people you would otherwise meet7) You'll be charmed by your tour guide - who will also spend a good amount of time entertaining your young children8) Some of this 'unlikely' food is really good9) It's a cheap way to learn and experience so much10) You'll learn the price of things - if you're then brave enough to go back to the places you're shown or buy from street vendors you know what you're doing11) you'll get courage to go back to the local restaurants and buy from street vendors12) A good bit of exercise - you'll walk your indulgences offP.S. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and was dreading the actual 'food' part, but did pretty well - it's not all snake and pork! Lot's of vegetables, fruits, ice-cream, drinks etc. for the non-meat eaters."

I loved that we get to try out food that otherwise we wouldn't try because we either don't know about it, or because we don't know where to go for it. I loved the red noodles, I loved the beef salad and I especially loved the pork and mushroom in rice flour pancake (no I don't remember the names in Vietnamese either). Oh and of course, egg coffee. Didn't think I would like the egg coffee but I was wrong. It was good. We ended our night at the beer street and had us some locally brewed beer, which was good too. So yes, I had a great time. Especially because I did it on my 1st day, I then knew a little bit more on where to go and what to expect, and of course getting to know a little bit more about hanoi and their lifestyle.

We rocked up at their office and booked our names for the 5pm tour. It was an easy and fast process. $20USD per person or if you didnt have USD could also pay in Dong. The price includes all the food you will consume on the tour.We were introduced to Thuy and another friendly tour guide who came along. Our group was a nice and small group and only has another older couple from New Zealand. Thuy and her colleague walked and guided us through the crazy Hanoi Traffic. It was funny having two small vietnamese girls protect us tall Aussies and New Zealanders). \"Sticky rice\" was the magic words to indicate we are crossing the road and to stick close to them.The variety of food shown to us was excellent. There was a total of about 8-9 different vietnamese street foods we tried. The portion sizes were just enough for each type of food and by the end of the tour we were super full and satisfied. Thuy provided not only great explanations about what we were eating and also the history of the restaurant/food/Hanoi lifestyle but also provided great chat and banter throughout the whole trip. The entire tour for us was about 3.5 hours.Overall this was a great experience and if you want friendly informative guide to Hanoi lifestyle and street food we would strongly recommend it! There is more to vietnamese food than just Pho and spring rolls! :)"

There's so much more of course, and this street food tour is a great way to dive into the city's food culture.We had a lovely experience trying out eight to nine different stalls/shops around the Old Quarter over more than three hours. We like eating where the locals eat and it was pretty evident to us that we were doing just that on the tour, often eating in hole-in-the-wall places or right on the sidewalk.The food was delicious and certainly nothing was shocking or off-putting. Our guide, Thuy, was excellent, particularly with our young son, engaging him and watching out for him - and the rest of us - as we crossed the roads with the famous Vietnamese traffic. Thuy explained to us what we were eating and why, and also pointed out helpful nuggets of information related to the areas we walked in. She was professional, friendly and clearly enjoyed meeting people and introducing them to her city's food. As tempted as we were to eat more, we paced ourselves, ordering only two portions to be shared among the three of us at most places we visited, so we could eat all the way to the last stop. We highly recommend this food tour near the start of your visit. Walking around with a guide is a great way to get your bearings, and having eight to nine dishes introduced in one night gives you a good idea of what to avoid and what to get more of for the rest of your stay."

Our tour guide was outgoing and fun, which made the experience even more enjoyable. The medley of tastes was quite interesting, and the flavors were delicious. We finished off the tour with a couple of beers on 'beer street'. And my only complaint of the night was with the people serving us our beers. Thier sign said the coldeset beers in the city. They served luke warm beer. I mean it was almost room temperture. And to add to the injury this resturant charged 'only the tourists' 2000 dong to use their toilet facilities."

Cody was great as he also threw in lots of information about the history of Hanoi. Definitely worth doing."

We had arrived the night before and sampled some street food and were offered herbs and a fruit with the dish but declined them as we didn't know what they were for. On the tour Hang explained how to use and eat those ingredients. As a previous reviewer has suggested go on the tour as soon as you get there so you can experience the food on your own afterwards with confidence. Hang is so jolly and enthusiastic she explains more than just food culture. We started the tour at 11am, breakfast is not required nor was an evening meal. We lost count of how many dishes we had and they are full size. Hang also bought us breadfruit from a seller when we were curious about it. She really made the tour unforgettable. Thank you so much."

We had a great time with Hien and got to try plenty of different foods - some from little places that we wouldn't have even known served food!Highlights were the steamed rice pancake, bia corner and banh da ca. The egg coffee was a treat too. Doing this tour on our first day gives us the confidence to try street food all over Vietnam for the rest of our trip. 2 of us did a private tour which worked out well as the streets where very crowded and noisy at 5pm. I'd imagine a group tour of 6 people would've made it very difficult to hear the guide. "

Miss Moon did advise that you won't need breakfast or dinner if you do you the lunchtime tour - and she wasn't exaggerating! Lots of great food, and finishing with the famous egg coffee (I don't drink coffee and I really liked it).We wandered past the next day and asked for a the best place to have a Pho Bo and Miss Moon gladly pointed us in the right direction - with a great recommendation.

We walked all over, to places we normally wouldn't eat while also getting information on the town, the monuments and it's history. We tried 8 different foods and 2 drinks. I enjoyed every piece of food we tried, even the ones I wouldn't normally pick to try myself and also enjoyed the drinks, even though I am not a beer or coffee drinker. I would highly recommend this tour. We met some lovely people and tried the best food.

From the rice noodles to the pork spring rolls to the creamy coffee, everything we ate was simply delicious. When we got adventurous to eat the unusual, our guide had a good sense of what we could safely try, and what we should avoid due to \"foreigner's stomach\". Everyone had fantastic fun experience. We highly recommend this as a way to start your visit to Hanoi."

This is Hanoi cuisine at its best. I was referred to this tour by a friend who had done it previously. She knew I would really like it. I am someone who likes to be with the real local people and this was the perfect way. Just seeing the life of the people made me feel like my visit was worth it. Being up close is the way that I like it. When I am on a tour, I\u2019m always mindful about the time. But our guides did not rush us. When you take this tour you are experiencing the best of Hanoi. Right away seeing the street vendors, I really appreciated the work that goes into preparing the food. The food tells the story. My son and I tasted a little bit of everything. My son stays thirsty so we always had a Sugar Cane Juice in hand. Next we bought the grilled meat by stick ( 6k-10k VND) with some vegetables. We also tried the duck egg (6k-8k VND) and bought quail eggs (about 10k VND for 5 eggs at the street market). My son really like the chopped black mushroom and meat cake called Gio cake (7k-10k VND). We were really surprised that the prices on everything was inexpensive since this was mostly for tourists. After that we tasted the fruits, had a couple different kinds of cakes and some yogurt. There are foods for children and yogurts for those ladies who are watching their weight. The experience includes the way the food is prepared as well as the taste. As we enjoyed ourselves as we went through the tour, I remembered that food is an art. Well this certainly is Hanoi art. Just keep an open mind about the different foods and enjoy.Our guides were very nice. It was well worth our while. Ready for a wonderful culinary experience? This is it. Don\u2019t be shy to try something different, something wonderful. It is a event that you won\u2019t forget. This was one of the main highlights of the country for us. We will come again one day. I give it a top rating."

The \"tapas\" menu included bun cha (grilled pork), egg pancakes, traditional beet, Vietnamese coffee etc. It is a highly recommended experience as it will make you more confident in developing your food knowledge at \"street level\"! Miss Moon was very attentive to everyone's needs and paced the tour very well so there was time to sit, chat and relax as well as trying the different dishes.I was very happy with what I learned and I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Ha Noi wanting to experience real Vietnamese food.

It was a great introduction to authentic Vietnamese cuisine when we arrived in Hanoi. My friend and I are foodies and this was a perfect tour for us. Phuoc and Linh were our guides and they had great knowledge of not only the foods but of the culture and history of Hanoi. The tour takes place in the old quarter, which is the hub of all the street food. We visited 10 places, 8 food and 2 drink places and at first when our group heard about the number we were a bit intimidated at how much food we were about to consume but all the servings were just the right size. There were about 9-10 of us in the group and because the old quarter is condensed with motorbikes and people, Phouc had a great way of keeping us together as we crossed the streets by referring to us as, 'sticky rice,' and to keep together like sticky rice as moved through the streets. :) The tour is $20/person and if you're adventurous in trying out new foods, definitely take this tour. You won't be disappointed."

Also had Banh Cuon (thin translucent white noodle pancake that wraps up a meat vegetable combo), simple dish with lots of flavor. Had a fried fish dish, however I didn't like this one, at least I tasted it though, haha.The 3 hour foot tour around the old quarter was also interesting. Being Friday night it was quite busy with the majority of people being locals which was great to see. Of course all the foreigners stood out.As a quick intro to VN and food, this tour was great for the first evening upon arriving in the country.Highly recommend :)"

If you are visiting Hanoi for the first time and want to try the street food but do not know which places are good to go to as a tourist and at the same time you want to sample some of the traditional Hanoi style food in the local laid back atmosphere but do not know what they are - then you should really try the Hanoi Street Food Tour. We absolutely enjoyed the three hour tour along with our tour guide 'Lucky' who took us to some of the places I would have never dared to stop and eat but aside that I would not even haven known what they offer nor that some of it is traditinal Hanoi food. Each and everyone of the places we went to was wonderful and the food delicious. I actually was somewhat disappointed that we could not go to more places after the three hours were over. Not sure if the guides always go to the exact same places but I would venture to say that all of them are good if you are willing to experience a bit and try to taste the tradtional street food in Hanoi. So I can definitely recommend this tour. It was one of the highlights of our trip to Hanoi. PS: I still think the price we paid is reasonable but you could also argue if one would know all the places they show you if you could have done it cheaper. Probably so. But I still think it is worth the money...and also fun and very tasty!! So a great evening out for some traditioanl Hanoi street food!!"

Fortunately, she did have our names. However, the price was different than was agreed in the email. She changed it without fuss.While still at their office, we, together with another family of 4, were offered a rice wine (37%!) and candy.Our tour with Mr Phuoc was excellent. He spoke good English, had a great personality, tried to answer all our questions, including questions about himself :) and kept us safe while crossing the 'Streets of Hanoi Old Quarter'.Not only did he take us to places we would not have gone to eat by ourselves, but he also explained other cultural tidbits to us.

Our guide took us on a walk all through Hanoi stopping occasionally for food, drink or an ice cream. We tried some things we never would have otherwise and had a great 3 hours. A must do if you're like us, curious about street food and unsure where to start."

Having landed in Hanoi from London very early in the morning, we decided to have some sleep and go on the evening food Tour to ease ourselves into our first time to Vietnam. We are both 30yrs and well travelled but were slightly Apprehensive, to be eating in 'locals' street food places, we decided to try the tour out anyway given the TA reviews. It was absolutely fantastic!!! And a great decision!! Chinh our guide was so personable, knowledgable and proud of her country, she made us feel really relaxed in our tour of 4 people. Being from London, we aren't used to sitting on tiny stalls with food being prepared everywhere - but the food we sampled throughout the 10 different places was DELICIOUS, we would never have tried these places had Chinh not been with us - a few places were down little ally's - which you would not know about as a tourist...we had a great tour....highly recommend!!!! The old quarter is so fascinating and having a beer watching the world go by was definitely exciting. Anyone not sure, give this tour a go it was great fun and the food so nice! We also booked the airport transfer, the driver was waiting straight away as we landed - Awsome Tours has been a great choice.Enjoy Hanoi!"

Brian's tour is a lot more than just a food tour--it was also a comprehensive walking tour of the Old Quarter and a history lesson on Hanoi. By the time we were sipping egg coffees at the end of our tour on a beautiful rooftop cafe--5 hours and 30 tastes of amazing food after we first met Brian--we felt like we were totally comfortable in this city we had just recently arrived in and ready to continue eating our way through it.

I must congratulate Brian for designing it so well, despite the inevitable kinks that needed sorting out.The execution was very good. It was peak traffic and the ride to the first stop seemed never to end, but Brian entertained us with interesting stories. Lan, his Assistant, was a very friendly local and nice company.This tour suits beer lovers and others like me who are easily satisfied with one can of Tiger Beer, nothing more. But I loved the taste of the 12 beers offered at the four stops. It was educational. We toured two breweries and learnt how beers are graded. In hindsight, I shouldn't have downed all the beers. They were so good! I even took a liking for the smoked lager at Barrett's Beer, with a very high amount of hop. But, after the 10th beer, it was hard to return objective taste scores to inform Brian. But the stop at Thomas' brewery, the third stop, was memorable. Thomas from Denmark knows and loves his beers, and I was infected by his enthusiasm.The food at the adjacent restaurants and pubs were excellent. I specially enjoyed the local salami and ham.This is not a budget tour. It lasts about five hours. It's packed with value, and so it's worth the money spent.I'll definitely recommend it to friends visiting town."

            "review": "Great guides, limited selection of foods. Tl; dr: Great tour for first timers in Vietnam/SE Asia and/or those with more limited palates. Experienced and adventurous eaters should look into other options.Let me start out by saying that the level of service and quality of the guides for A Taste of Hanoi are exemplary and have no bearing on the above star rating. For me, this was a 3.5 star/5 star experience, and I'm a harsh grader.The owner Brian picked up his phone in the middle of a tour in order to answer my questions, and confirmed my reservation within the hour.My guide Lan rose to the occasion of having only one person to show around (yours truly), displayed saint-level patience while trying to meet up with your directionally-challenged tour goer, and kept me in stitches the entirety of the 3+ hours we spent together. She's an incredibly bright, dedicated, and knowledgable young woman who I feel privileged to have met. She's accommodating, too: When we passed a vendor selling barbecued chicken's feet, she didn't bat an eyelash when I pleaded with her to stop so we could taste one, and remained in good spirits as I meticulously dissected each toe down to a tiny pile of bones.HOWEVER: I found the stops and items we ate over the course of the tour *a little bit disappointing.* For context, I have lived in Asia for over six years, am a food writer by trade, and self-identify as a very adventurous eater. Having read a little bit about Hanoi street food, I was looking forward to an evening filled with snails, eels, crab paste, and, well, a little more pungency. I was very thankful to be introduced to some dishes I hadn't yet experienced (bun bo nam bo was amazing!!), but part of me was looking forward to the bun oc, duck's blood, even an errant pork knuckle.Moreover, I suppose the crux of my dissatisfaction is that we went to places that *were* tourist destinations, *had* English menus, *could be* found without the help of a guide or food tour. Again, for context, my friends run a very successful street food tour business where I live long-term. One of their top priorities is ONLY including places without English-language menus or could be found in a guidebook. That's the expectation I have when I sign up for a food tour, especially a street food tour. But I found the highlights of A Taste of Hanoi to be the extemporaneous moments, the quick detours to man-on-a-bike-selling-snacks, the walk along the train tracks. Not the Old Quarter stop offs at restaurants with doors and tables, cheek to jowl with other tourists. I understand the limitations of logistics (boy, do I ever) but anything billed as \"street food\" or \"hidden\" should hew fast to those principals as much as possible. That all being said, I don't regret booking this tour, I do not regret meeting Lan. My favorite moments during the tour were ones of refreshing honesty, as we (I hope) transcended the roles of service person and customer. Make sure she tracks down the dried fish and green mango salad vendor, who sets up on a street corner after their landlord, jealous of their success, kicked them out and started selling his own, inferior salad. The original is best appreciated between gales of laughter while perched on tiny stools.Thanks for reading this far. Again, I think that for certain kinds of people, this is a most excellent introduction to the wonderful world of Hanoi street food. But, it could be just a little more adventurous for those of us already in the wild East."

Nikita and Lan led it and took a clear delight in showing us the inside byways of the city's intricate food markets and hidden-gem restaurants we never would have discovered on our own or even with our Lonely Planet guidebook. They patiently explained the stories behind dozens of vegetables and fruits and dishes we had never seen before -- how they're prepared, what role they play in Vietnamese culture, from the times of day they tend to be eaten to the different festivals and other celebrations where they appear. Nikita in particular displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of Hanoi's food origins and gave us a glimpse through her own personal story of how this fascinating country has changed so quickly in just three decades. But the best part -- if it's possible to pick one from such a pleasant experience -- was the way Lan showed up at different stops along the tour to bring us deliveries of different prepared foods for us to try. Each was a mouth-watering gift. We came to look forward to each stop when we would next see Lan, bringing yet another fantastic bite to eat, this one delicate balance of tangy and sweet, that one savory and spicy, each memorable on its own. This is a brilliant idea -- a rhythmic series of surprise-treasure snacks -- and it was executed strikingly well, with Nikita's timing leading the tour coinciding seamlessly with Lan's deliveries. It made the tour like nothing we expected and surpassed all of my expectations.One can't do anything about the weather -- it poured during our tour -- and yet Nikita eagerly pressed on, kindly furnishing ponchos for us that kept us dry the whole time.We were left happily full, both our bellies and our minds. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone seeking a glimpse of Hanoi and Vietnamese culture from the inside -- or simply an excuse to taste a stunning variety of the best foods Hanoi has to offer."

This is the first food tour I've been on so I can't compare to any others, but when I travel in future, I will be looking out for them, because eating only foreign food when you're in a foreign country means you're missing out.

She guided us around the old quarter and provided information with such enthusiasm that we were immediately sure we had made the right choice.She had a great in depth knowledge of the country's history and answered all of my questions with ease and always offered interesting insight. I like data and having visited the museums and other historical sites she was able to explain things and fill in gaps in my knowledge. She was also very open and communicable and we had lovely conversations.The food was incredible and varied and our lack of love for seafood was effortlessly cared for without feeling like we were missing out or that we were being a nuisance. The food coordinators were at each stop with our dishes prepared and amazing information was provided regarding the dishes; what they were, how they are made, information of the restaurant and its history. We felt we were seeing Hanoi on its terms rather than ours and this was a huge box ticked for us.Our last stop was a beautiful secluded rooftop restaurant where we shared coffee with our guide and the food coordinators. With our bellies full we hugged goodbye and walked around the large lake to aid the digestion and felt that we had not only had an incredibly enjoyable morning, but had made some good friends too. We really recommend you do this tour, even if you know your way around the old quarter!C\u00e1m \u01a1n, Lan, Brian and the rest of the team. --B"

Throughout the tour he kept up a running commentary about the area's history & highlighted different styles of architecture & interesting buildings from the grandiose to shacks along the railway track. Every few minutes there were new foods and/or beverages to sample, either in places where the locals eat (i.e. no English menu!) or brought to us by his assistant Lan, who was always ready & waiting for us. Brian explained how the various dishes were made & the importance of using the right ingredients (apparently, the Vietnamese are not prepared to 'make do').

Brian has a great knowledge of the food culture here and at each stop he told us about the history of the bar or restaurant we were at, the origin of the dish and the different ingredients...this made the experience so compete and much more interesting! it's surprising to see how many things are needed to create these dishes! One more thing that is certainly an advantage for us western tourists...Brian speaks really good English (maybe it helps that he is from the US?!?) and despite not being Vietnamese he's been living there for years and pretty much knows the city like his pockets and works with a team of local people from Hanoi.

I did the food tour on Saturday evening with Brian but do not have lunch as the amount of snacks,main meals,and drinks are a lot but excellent! Brians knowledge of history of Vietnam is great and I enjoyed his company we had a laugh! The next tour was the motorcycle tour of Hanoi which again was brilliant! I felt safe and really loved being whisked around like a local while eating and drinking,the coffee was delicious. Just book both of these tours they are both great value for money and an excellent way to see Hanoi. Just book it!"

The one night and two day tour cruise, was very good value.( we met others on different cruises who had paid double for a similar package) The cruise had good food (catered for all dietary needs), clean cabins and an excellent guide. So along with the beautiful scenery made this trip very relaxing and very memorable. He also organized all our other tour transfers (not booked by him) including airport transfers. Throughout our stay he kept in touch making sure there were no problems with the arrangements etc. ........... 10 out of 10 service ................

I really would recommend it to anyone who wants to see Hanoi and enjoy the amazing street food! Our guide Nikita was really passionate, knowledgeable, and gave us loads of information about the history of Hanoi as we walked around, we visited a few different restaurants specialising in different dishes and her lovely colleague Cham (Chan?) kept zooming up to us on her scooter to offer us even more dishes, we tasted about 30 things in total making this a really good value experience. The dishes were tasty and we enjoyed all of them, it's a great introduction to Vietnamese food and now we know what to order as we walk around! We had our 1 year old strapped to us during the tour and Nikita made sure we had enough rest stops and shade and really made sure we were happy and comfortable. It was a great way to see the city and I would recommend it to everyone. Thank you guys!"

We met out front of the market (an easy spot to locate) & started with a tasty morsel and tea whilst Brian told us about the history of the market. From there we explored market stalls and wove our way through the old quarter, stopping for a mix of historical & cultural background explanations along with food tastings (of course!). Brian was very well organised using an assistant to ensure we got to try over 30 different dishes during the morning session. Needless to say don't have breakfast before the tour and you definitely won't need lunch afterwards!The dishes samples included a few good breakfast options, snacks, drinks, sweets and coffee. At the end of the tour we were given a sheet listing the names & descriptions of all the dishes we tried, which was very useful for the rest of our stay.The tour ended by Hoan Kiem lake which is a central spot & easy to navigate from.Starting our trip to Vietnam with Brian's tour was the best way we could have started, it gave us the information and confidence to explore Vietnamese food on our own for the rest of our stay in the country."

We booked the food tour at the end of our Vietnam-trip because we heard a lot about Hanoi\u00b4s food-culture and wanted to dive deeper into Vietnamese cuisine. The tour took around 4 hours and Brian lead us through many corners of the old Quarter. We experienced lot of food, we hadn\u00b4t eaten before (or at least not in a similar quality). The 40$ seem to be pricy at first, but you get a lot for it: you learn much about vietnamese market life, the history and many little stories of the old quarter and most of all you get to taste 25+ dishes and drinks in a very high quality. Brian was nice and funny all the time and tried his best together with his good fairy (who organized everything while Brian lead us around ) to make us a great time. They fully achieved it :)Thank you very much!Isabella and Daniel"

Then this tour is most definitely for you!We had a great time with Brian on our tour this week. The food was amazing, it was really well organized, and you get a a dash of Vietnam history as well. It was so interesting to learn about the influences of other cultures on the vietnamese cuisine yet it still has it's own distinctive flavors and flare. The food here just isn't what I imagined when I thought of street food. Everything is super fresh and flavored with vibrant herbs to please the senses: sight, taste, and smell. Touring through the markets you get to see where all these delicious ingredients are purchased and how the local people handle their grocery shopping, which is quite different from western culture. It was so interesting!I believe you learn so much more about a culture when you eat the food where the locals go but it's even better when you can get an explanation from someone living here. Brian has been visiting and living in Vietnam for years and brings a unique perspective to the food scene here; it was great visit his favorite spots. Some of his favorite dishes weren't available in the area we were in. It was an awesome surprise for a young lady to pop up and meet us on her scooter with some special dishes that were must haves. This food coordinator was like a fabulous smiling food fairy bringing great surprises packed specially for us. It was a particularly nice touch.At the end of the tour I was full, full, full, and felt like I had a great sampling of the dishes around town. Don't dare eat breakfast and you might even think about skipping dinner the night before to pack away all the great stuff you're going to sample on this tour.Clearly I highly recommend this. It is worth your time and your money! Go, eat, and be merry!"

Mr. Brian greets you like a friend coming around for dinner - just the right balance of friendliness and knowledge and this guy is knowledgeable. A chef from New York and now Hanoi resident, he knows a LOT about both the food and the history of the city. You get to visit amazing markets and cafes where you get a different dish in each - just a taster, so you are not too stuffed to complete the tour. He also has a backpack of tricks, including a flask of local tea, sweet treats and a shot glass of rice liqueur - it's clear this chap puts thought and effort into what he does. I particularly liked visiting (literally) the other side of the tracks behind the railway, where those workers on lower incomes have their community and you could get your dinner for about 25p. This was an ace tour and I found Brian a great host - I hope his tour continues to be a success, he deserves it. Highly recommend A Taste Of Hanoi as it really is something out of the ordinary."

Brian was awesome - he talked a bit about the history of Hanoi which helped to understand why the cuisine in Hanoi is different to the cuisine in other parts of Vietnam. Brian was animated, enthusiastic and showed a genuine authenticity - he didn't just pay lip service, he seemed interested to know about us and our opinions. There was 2-way discussion, not just information being told to us. Great operator, a real people person. The food is wonderful, we went to a good variety of places and tried about 33 different things. Brian also went out of his way for our daughter (4 years) ensuring that he picked a few things up for her that were more suited to her palate. That was above and beyond as far as I'm concerned as Brian had waived the fee for her in the first place based on her probably not eating a lot. He has a team of 'food coordinators' that zip around grabbing bits and pieces that are too far to walk to and they deliver those to where ever we were. They went ahead and ordered food so we never had to wait for the food. My fave but was walking along the railway line - that was interesting. Thank you Brian and your team!

Brian knows a lot about history of the whole Asia and Vietnam in particular and tells it in a very interesting way, we were never bored with him. He showed us so many nice places and each further place was like a surprise. Various food we tried was delicious! Seriously, everything we tried was just amazing. And it was very well organised through the tour, alternating with the sights. For us, it was the best way to see and to taste Hanoi - bright, tasty and awesome. Brian is also very charismatic and open-minded, he helped us to organise a tour to Halong Bay for the next day, which was great, too.Just book this tour with Brian - you will never regret!Recommendations: do the tour right after arrival in Hanoi and do it on an empty stomach."

It was a great way to get a bit of history on Hanoi, get to see different areas of the city, and learn where all the good street food spots are. As a vegetarian I though I just wouldn't be able to eat at some spots, but the guide and food coordinator went above and beyond to make sure I had wonderful food at every stop (they did the same for another guest who was gluten free). Highly recommended!"

Very interesting! Every now and then his 'food coordinator' (a really sweet Vietnamese girl called Lam) showed up, just at the right time, with loads of good Vietnamese bites. A really nice tour!"

Brian's tour is a finely executed experience which combines not only an amazing array of 'insider' food experiences but a wonderful cultural tour as well. Brian includes a potted history of Hanoi, and why the food culture is the way that it is - and what's unique about it. As a solo traveler it was an unexpected bonus to see hidden parts of the city and enjoy a beer with the locals. I would highly recommend this tour if you're interested in food & would like an ex-pat's perspective on this sophisticated city. I did a more standard tour with a local operator the previous night - and although 'good' Brian's tour was far superior."

I will not write here about the places we visited because this is for me to know and for you to find out. The smells, tastes and colours of Hanoi are all reflected in a variety of food items you will try during this tour. And there is over 30 different dishes to try, so when Brian tells you that you don't have to finish everything each time we stop he knows what he is on about..., but the food is soooo yummy!!! Some of my favourites were kem and bo bia. The tour is extremely well organised and all runs smoothly. You can learn a lot of history and you are visiting places that regular tourists wouldn't even dream of seeing. The tour includes also some exercises ;) This is mainly due to size of chairs that locals seat in. On the hindsight, if you fell out of the chair you wont hurt yourself as it is never too far to the ground :) I would recommend the food tour and bike tour to everyone who wants to discover real Hanoi. Thank you Brian for making my stay unforgettable."

I'm was a complete novice to Vietnamese food and wanted to experience what Vietnam had to offer so I contacted Brian's A taste of Hanoi ,I booked a motorbike tour and a night food tour, Brian also organized our airport transfers in Hoi an and Hanoi which I was very impressed with as the Hanoi flight was delayed by 2hrs and the driver waited for us and from past experience with other airport transfers after 1hr the drivers leave ,so top marks already for A taste of Hanoi.The motorbike tour started with a pick up from our hotel and we headed out on the crazy streets of Hanoi where our first stop was to show and explain the mosaic that stretched for 4km , our other stops on the trip included the red river, west lake and few others , at each of the stops Brian would tell us a bit of history and to try some amazing food .Brian and his colleague Lubo were amazing tour guides and safe drivers.Our next tour with a taste of Hanoi was the night food tour starting at the dong Xuan market and ended at a perfect viewing point over ho hoan kiem lake/pond.During the tour you'll try 30 different types of food and lots stories and history as you walk a long the street of Hanoi I recommend you don't eat before the tour because my stomach was full.The night tour was great to experience Hanoi by foot and Brian takes you to places that you wouldn't dream of walking down so with out Brian's tour I think I would have missed out on what Hanoi had to offer.Top marks to a taste of Hanoi and I would definitely recommend this to my friends.All that I would recommend that you bring on this tour is a good pair of comfy shoes and camera.Thank you Brian and you staff for my experience one I'll never forget"

This is a food tour as food tours should be. We took the morning walking food tour. It is really two tours in one. A historical tour of the old quarter and an exploration of the mundane and exotic foods found in this quarter. The start of the food tour in the spice market really set the tone for the tour. It was one of the most visual and extensive spice markets I have seen in Asia. Another little twist that makes the tour fun, is that Brian is always asking you if you know what some is, or what the ingredients of a dish are before he explains it to you. This really perks your awareness of the food that you are enjoying. We tasted over 30 different things on the tour, which sounds like a lot. But as the tour lasts 5 hours and you are walking around a lot, at the end you do not feel full, at least I did not. I have only two recommendations: (1) select just two sweets at the end of the tour. I appreciate the effort to give a thorough intro to the wedding sweets. But two is enough. (2) The briefing at the beginning could have included a better overview of the tour. Oh, and hot tea on a cold morning would have be lovely, as you know! Kudos on a job very well done!"

My visiting friends loved the fact that he added some explanation - so although it's 80% a food tour, there's an extra 20% of history and facts that really adds some colour.The tour itself took a bit over 5 hours, and covered pretty much everything I'd expect food-wise, with a mix of restaurants, street food and markets.Best bit was right at the end, when I was about to ask if he could email us a list of everything we'd had - the list had already been printed for us.All in all, it's a great tour, and one I've recommended already to other friends who are visiting us."

By far the easiest and healthiest way to taste a wide spectrum of food from Hanoi (with a few transplant dishes from other areas of Vietnam). Brian is a great guide with a wealth of experience and knowledge. The food on offer provides a genuine taste of Vietnamese cuisine without upsetting Western stomachs. Highly recommended! Just remember to pack a zip seal bag for all the goodies you can't fit in - there was over 35 dishes to try!"

A pleasure for the taste buds and quenching of our thirst for some local knowledge. In all I think we tasted over 30 different dishes ranging from the spicy savouries to the subtle sweets and beyond including a few special drinks. Brian even catered for my non red meat eating diet. It was such a comprehensive tour and Brian's enthusiasm shone through. It certainly gave us an insight into the cuisines, their origins and trends. I'd suggest to certainly do the tour as its a must but better still do it early on when you first arrive in Hanoi so you can go back to all the wonderful eateries."

I've been living in Vietnam for almost 2 years now but there was still a surprising amount of dishes and information that was new to me on the tour. The tour guide is a native English speaker and very knowledgeable about not only the food but also the history and culture in Vietnam. Additionally there are two English-speaking Vietnamese employees who were happy to offer their unique insights. It was really a great experience and I recommend it for anyone in Hanoi, whether you've just arrived or if you've been here for a while. Thanks for the great tour!"

The woman said that the tour would be led by a western guy. I was excited right away that I would get a local guide but an expat local that knows the streets and the food, but also that I knew I would be able to understand him. The tour went off without a hitch. We met up with our very enthusiastic foodie guide at the big central market. From that point Brian presented us with awesome foods from Vietnam from start to finish. He brought us on a very cool walk that has lots of fun stories all along the way. I really enjoyed the spots he took us to where I felt like there was no other tourists around, and that I was really getting a good local experience.  Brian\u2019s passion for food really comes through on this tour. His fun collection of stories all along the way of our walk make the time go by so fast and made me feel so much better for the rest of my trip into Vietnam now too. I can order some of my own locals foods now without anyone helping me.  I would totally recommend this tour to anyone on their first day in Hanoi or their last. Very cool Tour Brian thanks again."

We chose motorbike tour Hanoi for their high rating and reasonable price. Anh was our guide. First he was adorable, very informative, kind and friendly. Drove safely (comparing to other Vietnamese drivers). We saw the Old quarter, Opera house, the Old bridge over red river, west lake (the peaceful lake in Hanoi as Anh said), the tran quoc pagoda, learned a lot about buddihsm and mao relegion - this part was fascinating to us as we learnt a lot about something that was vague to us. After that we went to see the last American B52 plane that was dropped by the Vietnamese in their war with the Americans. Next we visited the government buildings area and ho chi minh mausoleum - again we learned a lot on Vietnamese history and communism. We would summarize this trip as the best way to explore Hanoi and know about Vietnamese history, culyure, relegions, and most importantly from the great guide Anh,and we highly recommend it for others!!!"

We are so glad we did it!Initially, we were concern about safety, especially our daughter only 11 year old. Elly the team leader and her team are very careful, experience and safe drivers. This worry was off our mind right at a start when we were sitting on the motorbikes.So many to see including from beginning till the end. 4.5 hours is a right duration! The included lunch in a restaurant was excellent too.I strongly recommend Motorbike Tours Hanoi - Day Tours if you are planning to visit Hanoi for this experience:- Very responsive- Elly is cheerful, friendly & sincere - my daughter enjoyed being with herPS: Not forget to wear a mask"

The weather was nice as well, and they were easy to operate.Now, onto Hanoi, it was sooooooooooooo pretty! The tour guide was funny/witty and answered all my questions with tact and intellect. Some of the places we stopped at was just for the view, and some were an experience! Stops where we got to eat were the most fun.Honestly, this was one of the things I'll remember most about my trip to Hanoi. I'd recommend it! And don't forget your cameras!"

We're no strangers to Asia but we've never been to Vietnam before. I like to book a tour of where I'm staying to get a feel of local life and culture. At first I wanted to take a bus tour but then I found this motorbike tour company. Riding a bike makes you feel and smell the atmosphere like no other means of transportation. I could ride, but my friend was scared of the traffic around here. He opted for piggybacking with the tour guide, I rode a supplied bike.The trip was awesome. We did a daytour of the sights, you can book morning and evening if you like. We started with a lunch, I would have planned the lunch a bit later but we had plenty of time to snack along the way, the Ngoc Lam fresh market is fantastic! You get to see places like the Pagoda, Mausoleum and Opera House.We felt very safe during the trip, the guides were very friendly and provided us with a lot of background about the places we visited. I'm really glad we booked a motorbike tour instead of a boring tourbus. And if you don't ride yourself don't worry, you can just hop on with a guide. They really put safety first. Thanks guys, hope to see you again, I'd love to go back to Hanoi, great food, nice people and a welcome atmosphere!"

Hanoi is a beautiful, bustling, historic city and riding on the back of one of Peter's motorbikes is a safe way to experience it all. Peter picked up my girlfriend and I at our hotel and first drove us to the old French opera house. Then we went to an incredible traditional Vietnamese outdoor restaurant by the river--we had a hot pot fresh seafood dish and other local appetizers (jumping chicken). Peter knows a lot about the history of the city and explains it in detail which was great for us. Next we tried the famous egg coffee and it was delicious! The tour then heads to a live music bar where a band plays cover songs and accepts requests too. Next we went to a Vietnamese live house where we witnessed an acoustic set from a well known Vietnamese artist. After, Peter took us back to his coffee shop and explained to us all the many tours and cruises that are available in Hanoi. Overall, it was a wonderful 4-5 hour tour of Hanoi at night where we got to experience the excitement of safely riding a motorbike amidst the chaos of Hanoi traffic, sample the local food, listen to the local music, and learn about the area's history from Peter, our awesome tour guide. Would recommend this tour! Friendly, safe, delicious, and fun!"

We had an amazing local lunch and ended with a few beers by his shop. Hands down the best thing I've done in my life, and best way to see Hanoi. You get to escape the city scene for the day and have a blast on the back of a motorcycle. Alan also videos the trip on his GoPro and shares it, along with pictures, from the trip! SO MUCH FUN!! Alan is the BEST!"

Huy and his fellow rider (can't remember his name - sorry Huy) picked up my wife and I at our hotel at 8am sharp. We donned our helmets, had a safety brief and off we went! We were with them for over 5 hours and took in such sights as:Opera House, Long Bien Bridge, Ceramic Rd, West Lake, Phu Tay Hi Temple, Van Nien Pagoda, new Hanoi, French Quarter, a local market and a drive by of Ho Chi Minh mausoleum. If this wasn't enough, we were then treated to a fantastic lunch in a local restaurant in the old quarter - one hell of a spread which was delicious! Huy was a font of knowledge who displayed such enthusiasm for the role. We learnt so much from him about the city and the country as a whole. Their driving was first class which is commendable in the crazy traffic that is Hanoi! I would strongly recommend this trip as you get to see things and experience the madness of the roads that you simply wouldn't get with other trips! Thanks to you and your Vespa partner Huy and good luck for the future! Neil & Alison"

We visited a number of the main tourist attractions (e.g. Hanoi Opera House, HCM Mausoleum, and Long Bien Bridge) as well as other, lesser known sights (e.g. Local Markets, West Lake, and various temples and pagodas). Peter provided an interesting narrative throughout the trip and shared personal insights into everyday life in Hanoi. This is a must do tour to orientate yourself with the city and to absorb the culture, cuisine, and atmosphere of Hanoi. Thank you Peter and Leo for such a great morning!"

The motorbike traffic of Hanoi is perhaps one of the most memorable things about this city, and after this tour I'm convinced the back of a motorbike is the best way to explore and experience Hanoi! Peter is kind, professional, and incredibly knowledgable about the city, and he took us to some really great sites. We saw so many places we probably wouldn't have made it to, including a lotus farm and a lacquer painting studio. I'll admit I had reservations about getting on a motorbike here (watching the traffic can be super intimidating), but once we got going, all hesitation vanished! Peters drivers are safe and cautious. It was incredibly fun and exhilarating, and lunch was absolutely fantastic! I would highly recommend!"

He explained what we would be doing and I was sold! What better way to experience Hanoi than with a local on the back of a scooter! Since we were too scared to attempt the roads ourselves this was the next best thing. Peter and Elly were extremely knowledgeable on the history of Vietnam and Hanoi, and were more than thrilled to answer any questions we had! The sites and landmarks you stop at are exactly what we needed to experience Hanoi at its fullest and is something we would have not been able to do or known to do on our own! I would 100% recommend this tour to anyone wanting to see Hanoi with fun, caring individuals who want nothing more for you to see their city and have fun with them! They genuinely enjoy what they do and that's what impressed me so much! I hope to stay in contact with both of them as we became great friends on our tour!! Thank you!!"

We picked this tour, as it took us out of the city and showed us sights that we would have otherwise missed. Our guides were very professional, and peter has excellent English. He really knows a lot about Hanoi and it's history. I loved the story about the west lake, and will continue to look for the buffalo!! It was amazing to drive over the long bien bridge with the locals and I especially liked the tour around the local market. The sights and smells were insane!! It was great to sit and have a local drink (Che thap cam) in the market and then go to a local restaurant for some of the most delicious food that was all included in the price. I would not hesitate to recommend any of these tours, and when we come back to Hanoi, we will definitely take another tour with this company."

We started talking together and the first thing we appreciated was the fact that he speaks good English since most Vietnamese people we had met before did not speak so well. We then asked him some advice about what to see in Hanoi and that's when he told us about his Motorbike Tour and we were immediately interested in discovering Hanoi in such an original way.So the day after Peter and his co-worker picked us up at the hotel at 8am, and we went to see most of the main places and landmarks in Hanoi : Cau Long Bien, Ceramic Mosaic Mural, Tranh Quoc Pagoda, West Lake, some temples, the Museum of Ethnology etc...Peter was lovely. He is a really good guide and he knows a lot about Hanoi history and legends. Moreover he is from one of Vietnam's ethnic minorities so we learnt many interesting things about Vietnam thanks to him.In a nutshell, everything was perfect : a cool team, a great city tour and a really good lunch!We definitely recommend Peter's motorbike tour!"

I went on the Morning Tour which was a 4-5 hour tour that picked us up at 8.00 in the morning and took us through to lunch time. We travelled as a small group of 6 motor bikes which was perfect because I got to meet people from around the world but still feel a personal experience. We rode to a range of popular tourist destinations and learnt about the interesting culture and history of Hanoi. We also made stops in areas little known to tourists and got to experience Vietnam as a local. I really enjoyed going to a hidden market where there was a variety of fresh produce - I even tried jackfruit for the first time and loved it. At the end of the tour we went to a restaurant that specialises in local cuisine. The food was delicious and the beer refreshing. It was great to sit and share a meal with the group and recount the experiences of the morning as well as learn a bit about one another.To start with I was hesitant to go on a bike tour because I felt unsafe amongst the traffic but I am so glad that I gave it a go. The guides at Motorbike Tours Hanoi were very reassuring and friendly, and knew how to navigate the streets safely on bike. I would recommend this tour to anyone. You get to experience the exciting sights and smells of Hanoi with the thrill of being amongst the rush. You couldn't do better if you tried."

We took the morning 'Amazing Race tour which was a great way to get us to interact with the locals and learn more about history and culture. Our guide spoke very good English, was very informative so we learnt a lot about Hanoi and Vietnamese street food - we did have great lunch at authentic local restaurant with great food! Once you spend some time in Vietnam, you'll notice that traveling by scooter is the way of life and for an adventurous urban tour it is both novel and exciting. More importantly, if you were to tour by a bus or car, it would take you so much more time as the roads are mainly occupied by motorbikes. We only had a weekend in Hanoi so this was the perfect way to see the city in a half day tour. There are many different types of tours available with this company and booking this tour online was very convenient. highly recommended!"

If not on this tour we would not have seen Hanoi like this.The food was excellent and (believe it or not) we felt completely riding with them and weaving through world famous Hanoi traffic at night. By the end of the evening we were pleasantly stuffed and had learned a lot, not just about Vietnamese food but also life in the city and the people that inhabit it.

The bikes are in excellent condition and well maintained. Even though I did not have much experience in riding bikes he was able to guide us safely through the busy and frantic city traffic to the very winding, narrow and mountainous countryside. The accommodation was a mixture between hotels and homestays. Each homestay presented a different culture and accommodation style and the owners were more than friendly and welcoming. Thai was very particular with the meals that were put before us. Quite often he would present at the kitchen to check that the food was fresh and suitable to our tastes.The itinerary is tailored to incorporate the interests of the clients.

His suggestions and advice on length of time to spend in each town, whether or not some attractions were a repeat of something elsewhere, showed his knowledge of his country and an understanding of our wants.Our trip started in Hanoi and basically followed the Ho Chi Minh trail. This took us to Ninh Binh, Phong Nah, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An, Ho Chi Minh City and The Mekong Delta.Meals and the accommodation that Thai organised for us were fabulous. We also found that we were kept busy although when we needed time to do some shopping our requests were catered for.If you are thinking of traveling in Vietnam don\u2019t hesitate to contact Thai, he will give you a trip of a life time."

We met Thai a day before our trip was to take place. He had do a couple rides around the block to get us used to the trip out of Hanoi. We started a little late the day we were going to take off due to our friend who that got extremely sick. We found him a doctor and told Thai he would not par-take in the trip and would meet us in Da Nang. Thai offered to refund his deposit and had his wife take our friend to the hospital, wait with him, took him for food, then brought him back to our hotel. We were very surprised by this and appreciative. That evening he talked to our friend and they figured out a way for him to meet us on the next leg of our journey. The trip was very nice and stopped at some cool places like, Mai Chau, Phong Nha, and Hue. We missed Khe Sanh but not sure if it was because of the two days we started late due to sickness or miscommunication between Thai and I. There are things that bothered us barely but I feel it was more due to a difference in cultural norms than anything else, and I can not knock down his rating because of that. All meals were included made it easy to try new Vietnamese meals I have never tried before. All in all we felt that the services provided were good and minus a few hiccups I would recommend Thai and Go Bamboo to others.

Mr. Thai was very helpful and gave me all the information I needed to know. So I called him later on in the evening to reserve my bike and he said it was no problem. I came to pay the deposit it was a quick and easy process. I came on Monday morning to collect the bike I had reserved and it was perfectly ready and waiting for me. I quickly filled in the necessary paperwork and signed the contract and provided my passport as normal. The bike came with extra tubes and brake and clutch cables should I have any problems during me trip, I did not have any issues at all. I went to Ba Vi and back, the bike was amazing and performed 100% as expected. When I returned the bike my passport was returned to me and I jumped on the back of my friends cafe racer to go back home. I can definitely recommend Go Bamboo Motorbike Treks and will be going back hopefully soon as I have fallen in love with my Honda XR 150LThank you Mr. Thai for making my trip so easy and more enjoyable. Hopefully I will see you soon again."

So there is no time to waste in fixing bikes or stressing as riding on the roads, wondering if a part is going to run off the bike while overtaking a truck on a bumpy path...Well GO BAMBOO saved us those troubles! The bikes we rent were just new and perfectly set for the same price than some other renting place that would let you take the road with Vietnamese random trafic with ageless bikes litteraly falling apart. Beside the warm welcoming, the manager speaks a perfect english and has wise advices to give.I recommend warmly!"

It was very special feeling to see how the local lived. I enjoyed the food that they served to us. The sceneries was amazing. I love Ba Be national park. The Lake was amazingly beautiful. I would love to do more trips in the future with Thai Tinh.

I spent 2 weeks in Hanoi and during that time I went on 3 different tours with Go Bamboo Trek - around the city for a couple of hours, a half day tour to Bat Trang and a 3 day trip into the mountain villages of North Vietnam. I am over 50, was travelling on my own and don't ride a bike so on all the tours I rode pillion. Go Bamboo provided a jacket, helmet and rain gear (just in case). I found the tour guides to be very experienced, safe riders, they spoke very good English and their knowledge of the area was excellent. Their happy outlook made it obvious that they enjoy work and showed great respect to their employer. Thai, the owner of the business was truly fantastic, and a great help with organising my tours and in fact anything I needed to know about Vietnam. He pointed out the best places to eat or go shopping. He even directed me to a pharmacy, and then came with me in case I couldn't explain what I needed (how do yo say band-aid in Vietnamese?).Thai runs a very professional business and I highly recommend Go Bamboo for all your motorbike tours in Vietnam. I understand he can also arrange large group tours for a week or more. Absolutely fantastic!!"

He took us way up into the hills to a Pagoda where they hardly see Westerners. It was magnificent to say the least. We then rode a different way back to Hanoi and went to a Pottery Market and Long Bien Bridge that was bombed during the war and is still standing! When we got back to the shop, the owner and guide took us over the road to get \"the best Vietnamese BBQ in Hanoi. We sat on the street and ate a beautiful Vietnamese soup which contained noodles, meat patties, chilli, garlic and a few other ingredients which I cannot remember. It was delicious and interesting conversation hearing about the shop owners life in Vietnam and their customs. He was lovely and when we had finished our meal, he refused to let us pay and instead brought us lunch. I would highly recommend Go Bamboo Tours to anyone interested in exploring Hanoi. There are options for scooters (which are easy for anyone to ride) or trail bikes (for the more experienced). The traffic is a little scary but as long as you don't hesitant and use your horn, you'll be fine. AAA+++"

But he had a previous booking and so i was given Ta. My trip started off arriving at midnight and there was Thai and his driver waiting for me. Felt like somebody special my name on a sign board. I have spent three weeks in each of China, India, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar and this was the first time i felt i needed a guide. The roads in the north of Vietnam are not well marked and down right adventurous. I could not have been happier. While i sent exploratory letters to three tour agencies Thai's responses were quick and the most helpful. I told him what i was looking for and he responded with a personalized letter outlining his suggestions for a 17 day experience. I spent day one in Hanoi getting used to his excellent bike. A reliable bike was a must for me. All of Go Bamboo bikes are in excellent shape. And i would end up putting mine thru its paces. Good to see many of the local sites. Day two i was introduced to my guide Ta and we were off. The next 15 days were awesome. Could have been warmer for my blood but that's on me. My trip basically think of Hanoi being at the 6 oclock position on a clock and we went counter clockwise up to Sapa then east a bit to the Chinese border then made our way down thru the spectacular mountains and back to Hanoi. Then a over night boat trip to Halong Bay and my trip was complete. I choose Go Bamboo because of the excellent reviews here on trip advisor and that is why i am taking the time to write this one. From my travels you can see i am no rookie. I am sure you could pay more but i do not think you could ever get any better service. I wanted to experience first hand the people of Vietnam. I wanted to talk with people about their lives and what was the lasting impact of our war against them. I wanted to see the lands beauty and taste its great food. All of which i did. There we so many things i would have missed if not for my great guide Ta (did i mention his name before :) ). Some of my posts on Facebook are public. Kurt Gamlin... look them up. The pictures and the experience was great. I am already planning a return trip, longer stay, starting in Hanoi going over to Cambodia and i will hope to use Ta, Thai and Go Bamboo again."

            "review": "Driving in the clouds. My motorcycle club takes annual trips around the world. This year we are in Vietnam. On a good friends recommendation, we booked 7 motorcycles through Go Bamboo. One of our members knew the northern mountains of Vietnam but had to cancel his trip last minute. We have never hired a guide on any of our trips but were left in a predicament. Go Bamboo arranged a guide name Hoan for us. We were initially opposed to even the idea of having a guide. We enjoy doing stuff ourselves. Little did we know, motorcycle guides in Vietnam are trained in university for their job and come from the local villages we visited. The level of professionalism with Hoan was exceptional. He listened to our needs and planned us just the right amount of off-roading and unmapped country roads. We spent almost no time on major roads. We only had five days and there's no amount of planning that we could have done that would have led to a similar trip. We stayed with his family for two nights and couldn't have had a more welcoming and authentic experience. He also knows all the best food spots and tailored our cravings. I've seriously never had such amazing food. I'm talking food I'll never forget. I must mention that the 150cc off road bikes we rented were top notch all around. The tires all had proper tread depth. Chains were lubed. We didn't have one problem. That's never happened on any of or annual bike trips. Scrapping for a negative to make this review more authentic? Hmmmm, I guess some of our members wished he would have driven faster however I trusted that he had our safety in mind. Only once did our pack get split up. And that's a good thing in my opinion. Wish we had longer Anyways, all in all, I would 1000% recommend Go Bamboo and please request Hoan as he wont let you down. Before I could publish this review I decided to go out with another friend for 5 more days. Rented the same 150 dirt bike. Was solid as a rock. Had a very, very close call at high speeds. Thankfully the brakes, tires, and my attention were all working 100% or I'd be at the hospital right now!Thai is the man! Go Go Bamboo!!!!!"

The front wheel of my bicycle had fallen off and a nice guy helped me fix it and told me his uncle had a motorbike tour company, he then introduced me to Thai, it was destiny!I did a 3 day tour with Thai the manager of Go Bamboo Trek and on of my friends. It was really incredible. We went to Mai Chau which is to the west of Hanoi. Thai had recommended this as a really beautiful place to visit and in fact it was so amazing I've been back two more times since. I ride a bike in the UK and I can assure you that the bikes you get from Go Bamboo are well maintained, safe and a pleasure to ride. The 150cc Yamanha's are really good fun! Thai and the other guides are a really great bunch, I live in Hanoi and Thai has helped me out a couple of times when I have needed directions or help. My friend hadn't ridden a motorbike before so Go Bamboo also provided a day of lessons to make sure he was confident and safe. You will be taken care of very well on a Go Bamboo tour, eat, drink and laugh all day. We stayed in a homestay where Thai had arranged for the locals to do a traditional dance. The few days I spent on this trip will stay in my memory for ever!I recommend Go Bamboo to any of my friends and family that come to visit Hanoi!"

Having written a review for my trip in 2014, I felt compelled to write another... and I don't often leave reviews, good or bad!The team at Go Bamboo hands down made my trips to Vietnam the most incredible experiences I could've imagined.I spent 7 days biking towards the south (where it is a lot warmer in January than the North), having flown from the beautiful Phu Quoc to Hanoi. We were in Hanoi for the coldest day for 30 years (apparently!), but were enjoying coffee with Thai and his friendly staff at Go Bamboo in no time. In a crazy city of a million bikes, busy pavements and at times a feeling of complete chaos, it's very comforting to have some people you can rely on for local advice, a sim card, suggestions for trips...etc... without getting ripped off (which unfortunately is a common story for holidaymakers).Put simply, biking in Vietnam is the best, and arguably only way to see the true nature of the country. I've added some photos that I took on my trip which hopefully demonstrates the epic scenery that you encounter every single day.As I mentioned, this is the third trip now with this company and wouldn't consider going with anyone else. The ability to customize an itinerary based on what I wanted to see / do, along with suggestions and recommendations is perfect for me... I hate the idea of going on exactly the same journey as a million other tourists. I barely saw any Westerners on my trip (admittedly did try to avoid the usual tourist hotspots) and it really felt like I was discovering the place before anyone else!In terms of the bikes available, they were decent models, with a lot of them new and visibly well maintained. The guides are excellent and their local knowledge very useful... especially when ordering food and chatting to people along the way. I felt safe at all times despite the obvious \"excitement\" of the Vietnamese roads!!Anyway, wasn't going to leave a long review but there you go. Can't recommend Go Bamboo enough (ask to speak to the owner Thai, he's awesome) - you won't be disappointed!"

My wife and I went on a 7 day guided motorcycle trip through the mountains of N W Vietnam (Sapa, Dien Bien Phu, etc) with Go Bamboo and it was marvellous, the highlight of our 3 month trip. Scenery was spectacular, food and accommodations excellent, the ethnic mountain people very friendly and fun to meet, and our guide, Vinh, did a great job of eliminating the stress of travel. Vinh kept us on course and translated so we were able to communicate with the people in the small villages we visited. Having a good guide makes the trip effortless and much more fun. And most importantly, Vinh removed cultural barriers and helped us understand what we were seeing.The pace of travel was good, with regular breaks at scenic spots to stretch and take pictures. The bikes were in excellent shape with perfect tires for the conditions (about 90% paved secondary roads and 10% dirt or gravel) fairly new Honda's with manual transmissions and low mileage. (Go Bamboo has a variety of bikes, including automatics and semiautomatics.) We travelled on twisty mountain roads and averaged about 55 - 60 kph or 35 mph.We enjoyed the trip and our time with Thai, the owner of Go Bamboo, so much we spent an extra week in Hanoi. Thai really takes care of his customers and helps in many ways, recommending other tours, making sure we weren't overcharged, arranging hotel accommodation, even having our laundry and boots cleaned after the trip.I plan to return to Vietnam next year for a two week trip with Go Bamboo."

Its interesting to see how other families live in the different parts of the mountain villages.Thai picked us up at the airport and handled EVERYTHING for us - nothing was too much trouble and he really made it a stress free holiday for the whole family. The trip cost delivered exactly what was promised and Thai made sure we were happy campers even in the wet weather - He introduced us to 'his street' of Hanoi and the locals treated is really well, the people are friendly and the prices were great!a once in a lifetime family experience that we will be doing again in the next couple years.thanks Thai!! we will book with you again soon!"

The bikes were in great condition which was the first thing I noticed as previous hire bikes across Asia commonly have 300,000 on the clock and have been to the moon and back! The Go Bamboo bikes were not like this, they were well maintained and well presented. Leaving Hanoi is a bit precarious but as we followed our guide called 'Thai' the tarmac changed to rice paddies and the views got ever more spectacular. Our guide helped us with bike riding tips, navigating cafes and restaurants as well as engaging with the local Vietnamese and minority groups all of which we would have struggled with had we simply just hired bikes and forgone the guide. If there was six stars I would rate this six! Thank you Go Bamboo!"

He buys them new and changes them after a year or so, so they are in good condition. We didn't have any problems at all. He rides at your pace and makes sure everything is fine. My husband is an experienced biker but it was my first time on a proper road trip (I haven't yet passed my Mod 1) but I always felt safe and happy. And the trip itself was fab!

The guide, Thai, and the other driver, Hun, we're both excellent. We were both inexperienced riders and we went as passengers on the back of the two guides' bikes. We were accompanied by another experienced couple who drove themselves. We all had an excellent day and were treated to the delights of Vietnam's stunning scenery. Although busy getting out of the city, we always felt safe and secure on the back of the bikes. Once in the countryside, we could really appreciate all that Vietnam has to offer. Thai spoke excellent English and accompanied us on the boat trip in Ninh Binh which was part of the tour. Returned to Hanoi feeling exhilarated and filled with great memories. One of our favourite days in Vietnam so far-I would definitely recommend Go Bamboo, Thai and Hun."

            "review": "Our Best Day in Hanoi - None of us can ride bikes. There are a lot of motorbike tour opperators in Hanoi and we only had one day spare so we did a bit of research the night before. Very happy we did!Thai was the manager and owner of Go Bamboo, he responded to our enquiry in minutes and from the start wanted to know everything he could about what would make a day trip perfect for us. We were impressed, headed to his office in old town and were greeted with complimentary tea, brochures and testimonials. I believe we were lucky to catch Thai in person as he also offers bike tours of Vietnam, Cambodia and Loas (if you have the time and money then I syeongly urge you to email him about it). However, the office was manned constantly by a friendly crew who also spoke English so you will always be in good hands.Our group was comprised of seven people who couldn't ride bikes. Not a problem, Thai got us all drivers with only a few hours notice. Some couldn't speak English so Thai organised games and funny group photos at our first cafe stop off so that we could all get to know each other. We loved it. One young driver loved Eminem, as did one of our group members, so we had to endure hilarious rap battles at every stop. You can choose to be picked up from hotel or start from their office. You can also choose your own timetable. We left at 8am to cram in as much as possible and returned before dark.The day tour is customizable but we wanted to see villages and mountains. Thai took us to a national park which has stunning views (and a short but hearty climb at the end). We stopped in a beautiful town on the way with an acient pergola for drinks. Thai gave us history and cultural lessons at most stops which was excellent and unexpected. Lunch was included in the price and was very good, more than we could eat.The only negative was that one of the bikes had issues trying to asscend the mountain. This was our own fault, had we booked earlier we would have avoided a few older bikes (which we had been warned of prior). However, Thai organised for two mechanics with tools to be drivers so we were back on the road in no time. Outstanding day trip and highly recommended."

We had it arranged to have the bikes placed on the train; we picked them up in a small town about 4 hrs. outside of Hanoi.We had no problems at all.

My two friends and I met Thai in the summer of 2011. Thai was very professional throughout the entire planning process, and he organized a 5 day tour starting in Hanoi, through Mai Chau, Son La, Dien Bien Phu, Tam Duong, Lai Chau, Sapa, and finally Lao Cai. I had ridden a scooter before, but never a full manual bike. The first day we met Thai, he arranged for us to get our bikes, and we learned to ride in Hanoi. Learning to ride in Hanoi rush hour traffic was one of the most stressful and exhilarating experiences of my life, but I nevertheless got the hang of it. It was at least enough to leave Hanoi the next day and make it to the rice field valleys in Mai Chau. I really couldn't describe to you in words the awesome scenery and the places we stayed. Just google these cities... Despite not knowing initially how to ride a bike, I felt quite safe with Thai guiding us. The food stops we made, the hotels/guesthouses we stayed at, while not 5-star at every destination, were nevertheless beautiful and inspiring. That being said, some hotels were very nice. I felt like I got a candid view of Vietnam, rather than the touristy crap one experiences in a large city. The roads aren't always paved, my friends and I slipped once or twice, but it was part of the grand experience for us. If you are at all considering visiting Vietnam and if you have the slightest inkling of an adventurous spirit, I urge you to contact Thai and speak with him. While he may have started as our personal tour guide of Vietnam (he knows the country like the back of his hand), we became great friends by the end of the trip and still talk. I reminisce about this experience the most of any of my travels. Do yourself a favor and explore Vietname on a motorcycle with Thai. It will change your life."

This is the 2nd time we have used Thai and Go Bamboo and once again Thai met all our expectations.This time Thai had an active part in our whole trip to Hanoi. He arranged our visa letters for us, picked us up at the airport, arranged for us to stay in the Gondola hotel which is in an excellent location to the old quarter and even gave us an impromptu walking tour of the old quarter on our arrival.Our previous tour of Northwest Vietnam was by motorcycle and arranged by Thai, this time our wish was to tour Northeast Vietnam by car - whilst Thai specialises in motorcycle hire and tours this was not a problem and he arrange for us to have a very adequate car, driver and himself as guide.His knowledge and love for his country is very evident from the start, he arranges excellent accommodation (just loved the homestays), helps to choose a variety of local dishes to eat whist being conscientious of dietary needs and likes at mealtimes. He is happy to stop at every request to take photos and usually knows where the best views are to be found.If you choose to tour the Northern regions of Vietnam be it East or West be prepared for an adventure - be open minded about being outside your comfort zone, don't expect 5* accommodation DO expect the most stunning scenery, the change to \"mingle\" with minority people and to be blown away by the way they liveWe had an amazing time and certainly will not hesitate to make it \"three in a row\" should we visit again - thank you again Thai it was fabulous"

In addition to miles of beautiful scenery this trip gives you the opportunity to interact with the locals throughout the countryside and learn about their culture and way of life. Also the food is fantastic throughout the trip. I did a five day ride to Sapa. I recommend spending a night a Dien Bien Phu as the city and war museum offer an in depth look to Vietnam's struggle for independence and how that influenced modern day life in this country. Thai is a wonderful tour guide, filled with knowledge and expertise about riding motor cycles, Vietnamese culture and tourism. Thus, Thai plays several roles for those interested in traveling to Vietnam, including tour guide, travel agent, and general adviser. He is worth contacting if you are traveling to northern Vietnam even if you are not interested in a motor cycle trek as he can point you in the right direction for places to stay, tour groups to use, and even make the bookings if you want. Prior motorcycle experience is not necessary, though as someone who never rode a motor cycle before doing this trek, I recommend practicing in your home country before you arrive in Vietnam. All in all this trip was a fantastic experience and was worth every penny."

If like us you are looking for a great adventure and are confident travellers but still appreciate the security that a good guide can give you I would throughly recommend Go Bamboo Trek and Thai our guide. We travelled for five nights and six days around Meo Vac , Don Van and Ha Giang with the highlight of driving and walking through the Ma Pi Leng pass in the frontier. Being in our fifties we chose to travel by car instead of bikes and for us it was the right thing although progress on some of the mountain roads was slow. The scenery was amazing and we could stop whenever we wanted and in extremely picturesque areas we often walked through rice paddies and farms met and interacted with the minority people and were able to observe their customs first hand. We were travelling in an area where permits and visa were needed and our Gide sorted all this for us as he did our home stay accommodation. This was fantastic for us eating together and often all sleeping together in the same room in little cubicles separated by beautiful curtains. Only do this trip if you are looking for and willing to take part in the Northern Vietnam experience. We are what the locals ate because there was nothing else. Again our guide helped us through a strange mix of different dishes. It's important to remember that we were quite an attraction to many of the people we saw with numerous photo stops for them to pose with us. With our input our trip was arranged and organised very efficiently by Thai to give us the experience we wanted in an area where in the six days we only saw a handful of western travellers. I am 100 % convinced that if we were travelling without our guide we would have missed most of the most memorable sights views and tastes of the trip. To conclude I would suggest planning your trip with Thai well in advance and let him know what type of experiences you want then like us you won't be disappointed."

Having done an incredible 2 day motorbike trek with Go Bamboo to Mao Chau about 4 weeks ago (which featured a very picturesque homestay in the countryside & traditional dancing for which the whole village attended!), I had no choice but to ask for a 10 day motorbike tour from Hanoi to Nha Chang.I happened across the shop after my friend's pedal bike's wheel fell off, which they were more than happy to help fix on the spot! I was also fixed up with a SIM card and a great coffee... perfect!Put simply, my tours have been amongst the best experiences of my life. I couldn't think of a better way to see Vietnam and wouldn't dream of booking with anyone other than the team at Go Bamboo.The locations we've visited have been breathtaking, and I've learnt a lot about the true history, culture and language of Vietnam from my guide and the locals we st along the way.Starting in Hanoi, we visited the Angel Fish stream in Cam Thui, then Tan Kay, after which we stopped at Phong Nha National Park to check out the beautiful caves. We then made our way to the War Memorial, a very peaceful area dedicated to the memory of women who lost their lives. Other highlights included exploring the tunnels of Vinh Moc, riding down the beaches of the east coast, the beautiful city of Hue, and finally ending in Nha Trang.They also arranged a tour to Halong Bay and Cat Ba Island which was brilliant & without complaint.I have had an incredible time in Vietnam, largely thanks to Go Bamboo, and would highly recommend them to anyone for tours, motorbike trips (no matter what your skill level) and coffee in Hanoi!"

Me and my friend were doing a motorbike trip in north vietnam for a whole month, and its hard to find the best words for it... cause awesome or \"decent\" dont really fit :DIt's just impressive if you see those mountains, waterfalls, those lakes and villages with your own eyes and meet these incredibly nice people of vietnams countryside !I think you can really notice the shop-owner \"Thai\" is coming from one of those villages. He and the others are really relaxed and helpful, they arent pushing you to buy buy and buy l(like a lot of people in the capital); -they are just there to help you out for any kind of questions. When I needed help on my trip (also in Hanoi) they've been there to help me. They took their time to get a plan for me and my friend where to go in vietnam and which spots to see (without even asking for any money :O! ) and after an hour or 2 at smoothies and beer, we had the best travel-guide possible, with numbers of cheap homestays and everything !also you get quality food for really good prizesI recommend to all my friends who travel to vietnam, to jump in at Go Bamboo, have and have a chat with honest Vietnameese people who speak great english. If you dont know for 110% what exactly you want to do in vietnam, go there, and you'll find out.(if you do have a plan already go there and get a better one haha)It'y definitely worth the visit, just spend some good time with good people."

It was one of the greatest travel experiences I have ever had.Taitinh is clearly experienced: he has taken this trip over a hundred times. While not cheap (by Viet Nam standards... very reasonable by Western standards) I had the luxury of having TT as my personal guide. He is very friendly, knowledgeable, and offers great insight into what you see: everything from history, to spiritual life, to geographical knowledge. The trip becomes a lens through which one can learn about the country as a whole.The trip was a \"complete package deal\" with TT organizing every aspect and providing all materials. As someone who has never ridden a motorbike, I had requested a lesson before we set off. TT promised one, but it never happened, which made the first trip in the rain, through Hanoi traffic, a little trial-by-fire. At the end of the first night, I was offered a chance to see a \"traditional indigenous show\" which, though good, cost me the full $75 as I was the only person in the tour group! In retrospect, I probably wouldn't have done this again.Those two things aside, the trip was amazing, and TT a great guide. I would definitely recommend him to others, and will travel with him again the next time I go to Viet Nam."

I had the greatest adventure in Hanoi thanks to Linh from Paloma Motorbike Tours.I booked a night tour and it was one of the best ways to see how Hanoi comes alive on a Friday night. I began my adventure in the French quarter where Linh expertly navigated through Hanoi\u2019s peak hour traffic to have a light refreshment. Drink of choice was between an egg coffee and something akin to a green tea smoothie. I choose the green tea smoothie and it was delicious. We had a great chat with Linh and I got to know more about the Vietnamese culture.We then travelled along Long Bien Bridge where we stopped to take in the sites and take a few photos. I got to see Hoan Kiem Lake and enjoyed one of the best dinners at a local restaurant in Hanoi\u2019s Old Quarter. The service was quick, atmosphere electric and the food bursting with the most amazing flavours. After a hearty dinner we were back on the scooter where I got to appreciate some of Hanoi\u2019s historical buildings. I was fortunate enough to witness the march at the Ho Chi Minh complex and it was amazing.Westlake was glittering with the city lights and despite the hustle and bustle of Hanoi we were able to enjoy a peaceful moment.We travelled via the night market to the Binh Minh Club where I had the pleasure of enjoying live Jazz music.The last stop of the evening was the Opera house.What made my adventure truly spectacular was Linh. Not only did she ensure my safety but it felt like a long time friend was giving me the tour. Linh\u2019s very knowledgeable about Hanoi and Vietnam\u2019s history and I loved her passion.I would highly recommend Linh and Paloma Motorbike tours to my family, friends and anyone wanting to experience the beauty that is Hanoi."

Just had to ask them what was what. That's how we found out about this fantastic tour company. Went back to our hotel that evening and booked them for the next morning. We chose the customized tour since we had already seen most of the 'must see' sights and wanted to have a more local experience. Linh and Coco (?) met us at the hotel at 9 the next morning and we came up with a plan for the day. They took us through some lovely neighborhoods, over the famous bridge, past the Ho Chi Minh park (which they knew was closed for maintenance and that the body was away in Moscow for 'maintenance') unlike our hotel staff. Linh then suggested the Museum of Ethnology (?) which was lovely and she was a great guide. Her love for the museum and her country's history was very apparent. Their English was fantastic and I even got to practice my Mandarin a bit with Coco as she had spent a year in China. We also requested some Pho and coffee and so they took us to some great local spots...both were absolutely delicious. My friend was extremely nervous of the traffic but Linh quickly put her at ease and we both enjoyed the trip enormously. Without a doubt my favourite part of our trip to Hanoi and would definitely recommend it to anyone. Great for seeing the usual spots but even better to get off the tourist trail and see some genuine Hanoi neighbourhoods. Thanks so much!"

The girls (riders) were very careful and had our safety in mind at all times. their attitudes were delightful at all times and took us to some normally unseen places in Hanoi like a cafe serving egg coffee , another serving snake for morning tea (don't miss it ) and we all joined together for great lunch at local restaurant. Top marks for great tour. Thank you girls , and we loved your ao dai dresses"

We stopped off for egg coffee first and my partner had egg hot chocolate as she's not a coffee fan. Both really good. Then a quick ride round to some of the best tourist spots in Hanoi before some amazing appetizers. Then another ride round, quick stop at the flower market where we saw the calm before the storm. Then onto the main meal which was delicious. Loads of food! Make sure you're hungry. Linh and Trang were amazing - Trang was free the following day so she showed us round the rest of Hanoi on foot. Really professional company too with smart uniforms and nice comfy bikes!"

I was picked up at the hotel by the driver/guide, and traveling solo, she turned out to be a great companion as well. A very good (and safe) driver, knowledgeable about both Vietnamese history and Hanoi as a city, and also very updated on current affairs elsewhere in the world. I had the best time combining the sights, being \"part of\" the crazy traffic, and having interesting conversations about this and that.

The tour was comprehensive, we caught sunset by the Long Bien Bridge, visited several local eateries serving authentic local fare, and stopped by attractions like the Opera House, Mausoleum etc. Our tour guide, Tuan, is a veteran and was extremely knowledgeable. Our drivers - Andy, Ly and Nga were friendly and we enjoyed our conversations (as well as our safe ride!) A terrific experience. "

We had pre booked a scooter tour in Ho Chi Minh and the whole family loved the scooter experience we made a last minute enquiry with Paloma for a booking in Hanoi. Their response was prompt and they were able to accommodate us with the chosen date. We had no idea what tour would be suitable because of the children so Paloma suggested a private tour option for us. We did a 5 hour tour which took us to some main scenic attractions and some off the track tourist spots. The food stops included were great and even the children enjoyed majority of the food.The all girl driver crew was fabulous. We had Elly Thao (main guide), Mary Dong, Andy Quynh, and Gabby Nga. We took the video option so Rose Duyen and camera man Cuong also followed us on the tour. The video option was great as we didn't need to worry about getting coverage from the tour. That night, photos were emailed and a week later, we received the video with music of our choice.All in all a fabulous tour. I highly recommend Paloma Tours to everyone who visits Hanoi. The traffic will seem daunting at first, but with such a competent team, you need not worry about your safety, and just enjoy yourself and soak up the atmosphere."

The first stop Pho chicken soup was out of the world. Vietnamese coffee was mind blowing. both spoke excellent English and take pride in showing their city.

Since we had some spare time after the cruise and before leaving for the airport, we decided to try Paloma's motorbike tour. Two female guides, Elly and Gabby took us on this tour. It was my first time riding a motorbike. At first I was afraid to get on and sat stiffly on the bike. Since both guides were very reassuring, I learned to relax after a few minutes and actually enjoyed the ride. They took us around the city. We had a wonderful time in spite of the rain. They even came prepared with rain coats for us. The food stops were great--we had 4 food stops for chicken noodles, egg coffee, dinner and bo bia (dessert). I enjoyed the food as much as the sights. The best part is overcoming my fear of riding a motorbike and feeling the wind on my face as we rode. It's definitely an experience I will never forget and will recommend to anyone visiting Hanoi.

We were shown traditional sights as well as locations completely off the radar and the stories behind each were incredible. The food at each stop was delicious and would have been the highlight of the tour if it wasn't trumped by our amazing Tour Guide. A young lady named Mickey.She won our hearts the moment she greeted us all in our native languages. Mickey takes the crown and really makes doing the tour all the more worth it.

We were nervous and excited in equal measure about what the next day had in store. Elly our guide met us with such a friendly welcome in our hotel reception and introduced us to our drivers Quynh and Rose - who gave us our all important helmets! Off we went on our mopeds - and I thought it might take us a while to settle in but our drivers, Quynh and Rose are so experienced - we felt really safe right away!...which was a surprise having seen the Hanoi moped madness the night before in town!We visited local food spots for eats and treats we could not have found ourselves, delicious bun bo nam bo noodles; egg coffee; zipping through spaghetti junctions and past beautiful lakes for some fresh spring rolls and delicious salad. We stopped off in the literature museum, a local food market and drove across Long Bi\u00ean bridge for a tasty lunch across the other side of the red river in a lovely local family restaurant. We picked up lots of information along the way from the lovely Elly and the whole thing just felt like we were hanging out in Hanoi with friends. We were on a high afterwards! And I can honestly say it was the best tour of a city we've ever done. Totally recommend it. And I just wish there was a Paloma motorbike tour every place we visited! Such a brilliant way to see a city. Thanks Elly! And thanks Rose and Quynh for keeping us safe x"

You get a helmet and a walkie talkie, so you can communicate during the ride. We started out at a small but popular coffee bar, the kind you don't easily enter as a foreigner. There we had our first Hanoi egg coffee (very good) and got our vriefing for the rest of the night.It was the start of a wonderful experience. We ate amazing dishes and got tips on how to eat them from our guide. The drivers are incredibly careful and skilled. I had the nicest driver ever, we had very nice and funny discussions while driving through Hanoi traffic.The guide told us interesting information and took us to places we wouldn't have found otherwise.So a big thank you to Paloma Tours for the amazing experience! If you want to experience Hanoi from a different point of view, book this trip. You won't be sorry!"

Fortunately for us, there was no reason to worry at all. Our main guide, Elly, and her team of Alice, Trang, Dung and Thu were absolutely excellent. They were confident motorbike riders and made our experience riding through the very busy streets of Hanoi truly one of the highlights of our time in Vietnam. And to top it off, all of the food and tour stops were perfect! Couldn't recommend this tour enough!"

Ellie met us at our hotel and welcomed us and then introduced us to our riders . We had a fun informative evening . First stop was to have egg coffee which is traditional to Hanoi. We loved. Each stop that we had , Ellie chatted about the food, the culture and the area we were in. This was a more personal tour riding across the bridges and touring around Hanoi that we had not seen on more conventional tours . The riders were lovely and we enjoyed talking to them as we went around . We had great laughs and was a highlight of our 5 night stay in Hanoi. Than was my rider and she was fabulous negotiating the roads . Thanks Ellie and all the girls for making our night special ! We loved our tour and meeting you all ! Totally recommend as a fun way of seeing and experiencing Hanoi"

Safely become one of the movers rather than one of the dodgers as you zoom between your various sidewalk food stops. Safely eat good food at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 surrounded mostly by local people. We were lucky enough to be taken to a local house for a taste of what real Vietnamese eat. Eat only what you want, no pressure to clear the table. We also got to see things that were out of old town. Hanoi has much else to offer. Plus our drivers gave us a lot of unique cultural information as we drove. I'd do this trip again next time I am in town. Yes you wear a helmet. Gord and Carol 70+"

We were picked up on time at our hotel, in the old quarter, and taken to the original egg coffee shop to meet the other members of our tour. There were six of us all as pillion passengers. After a safety briefing and outline of the evening by our fabulous guide we were off. We were picked up at 6.30 and dropped off just before 11pm. Our tiny female drivers were extremely competent drivers. Despite the frantic Hanoi traffic we felt very safe. We saw the night lights near Lake Kiem, West Lake, Old Quarter, the mausoleum and visited the flower market. About 8 pm our trip was punctuated with two dishes of food and at about 9.45pm we stopped again for a set menu dinner. There was plenty of food and drinks included in this tour, lots of laughter and chatter between drivers and clients. Thuy, was a fantastic driver and lots of fun. I would recommend this tour to people of all ages."

I was a little concerned since I have three kids (11, 15, 18) and after living in Asia for the last 15 years and watching locals drive motorbikes. My youngest two were definitely nervous. After thinking about it, I thought why not. We can always stop if it scares them. Fast forward to the day before our tour, OMG watching and walking in Hanoi can be dangerous. Motorbikes are everywhere and drive unlike I have ever seen. It made me second guess the plan and my middle one was not liking the idea AT ALL.The day of the trip came and it was a beautiful winter day, I had two very concerned family members. When the bikes showed up, immediately I saw my daughters shoulders relax. Our drivers, all ladies, had such a sweet and friendly smile and attitude. Our guide was relaxed and kind. The drivers proved a quick safety lesson and helmets. We stayed very close to our first stop so it gave the kids a few minutes to get comfortable. The kids LOVED it. It was the highlight of the trip. The food was fun, we saw so much of Hanoi - I doubt you could see as much any other way. I highly recommend this trip."

If you're not familiar with driving a motorbike in a city like Hanoi, this is the best way to go - don't even try renting your own scooter. Special shout out to our guide, Elly - she was fantastic at explaining the history of the sights and providing ideas on where to eat in the city. You can hear the great pride she and the driving team have for their people's culture and history. We started with a few photos at the Opera House, then spent a good amount of time at the Temple of Literature. It was crowded on a Sunday because lots of students were there to celebrate their graduation with friends and family - it may be less crowded on a week day. Then we walked past the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum - affectionately called Uncle Ho, he body was being refreshed in Russia that month so we didnt get to see him. We drove down \"the most beautiful boulevard\" which was lined with French-style homes that were taken over by the government after the French were kicked out. Then we went over a bridge built in 1901 to the suburbs where we had a local meal with a view of the old bridge. This was the best way to see Hanoi"

The girls from Paloma turned up promptly and having never even sat on a motorbike before felt completely at ease getting on the back of a scooter and weaving our way through the chaotic but organised Hanoi traffic.First of all you stop for a coffee and briefing and then you get on the back of the bike and see the real Hanoi side streets as you navigate your way through to the main attractions. All the time I felt very at ease on the bike and every time we got off to see an attraction the girls made sure we were ok. Their English was good and they told us a lot about the history of the city that we didn't know.The tour stops several times for food and by the time we stopped for lunch with a fab view of the Long Bien Bridge we were already full but got to try some authentic Vietnamese food - which having never been to Vietnam before was so good to eat.This tour really helped us learn about the city and give us the confidence to walk around on our own as we could ask the girls anything at all. If you are a single traveller, in a group with others or just experiencing Hanoi for the first time I would recommend this tour to you in order to give you the \"wow\" factor and let you see the real Hanoi. The girls restaurant recommendations were also superb and would like to thank them both for a superb introduction to Hanoi. If I went back to Hanoi again I would definitely go in one of their tours."

Arrived in Hanoi on Friday night and had a Paloma tour booked for 0800 Saturday morning. our drivers met us at the hotel on time and we got straight onto the scooters. There was two of us and we were the only ones on this tour. Had no idea what to expect and this turned out to be a brilliant, fun, crazy experience. Crazy because you are right in the middle of the Hanoi traffic, but there is no better way to experience Hanoi. Our drivers were amazing, handling the scooters with ease. They were friendly, fun and made sure we had a great time. The coffee and lunch stops were very good, and a great way to sample local food. I would highly recommend this trip - its the best way to get your bearings and understand how the traffic works in Hanoi."

We had just gotten into Hanoi and were not staying for long so this was the perfect tour in order to see the whole city! We were so scared to get on the motor bikes but once we were on them the guides were so nice and so safe that none of us were nervous at all! They did a great job navigating the side streets, highways and bridges. We saw so many great sites and the places they took us to eat were absolutely incredible! We started at a really cute coffee shop. Then we got these local snacks and beers (which could have been a meal in its self) and then we went to a bbq place where they had the best duck I have ever eaten along with at least 7 other dishes and more beer and water! Nam was on his own bike and talking to each of us through walkie talkie thoughout the whole tour so we knew everything we were seeing. He was so knowledgeable and really cared that we had a great experience... which we did!! We made the perfect number of stops that kept the tour exciting and educational the whole time. After this tour I had completely fallen in love with the city and am so happy we chose such a great adventure!!"

A few years back, I wrote of our XO Foodie Tour of Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City; Paloma seems to have copied that tour for Hanoi.The Hanoi tour is a day tour and includes visits to a number of the main sites in Hanoi in addition to a sampling of Vietnamese cuisine, Hanoi style. My wife and I were passengers on the back of motorcycles driven by our guides, two young ladies in traditional 'ao dai'.We toured the old city and various areas in the newer sections to see the sights of Hanoi. All along the way our guides explained anything and everything about what we were seeing as we drove along. We stopped at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and grounds, the West Lake, a number of temples, pagodas and markets. It was a nice way to spend the morning. We finished with a lunch that included an assortment of area specialties and received T-shirts and pashmina scarves as souvenirs. The tour cost about $59 each and was well worth experiencing when you are in Hanoi."

The lady who escorted me in the tour was great, teaching me a lots of Vietnamese culture, traditions. All the arrangements were well organized though the weather was not so good.

We only booked by telephone when we got there, and there was just 2 of us, so it was essentially a private tour. At USD68 per person, we got a crew of 4 in total, a tour of about 3-4 hours, dinner, snacks, drinks, a free t-shirt and a scarf for each of us - I would say very good value. Good explanation by the guide Nam, who took really pictures of us as well! He was very chatty and great to talk to. The guide and drivers were freelancers, so it was interesting to also talk to them about their day job - one works in media, one is an entrepreneur and another is a budding designer. Food quality was so-so, but loved the ride across the bridge. It's cold in Dec, especially on the bike, so dress warm! This was a highlight in our trip - highly recommended."

The idea of hopping on a motorbike in Hanoi was a little intimidating, but the drivers were all fantastic and the bikes seemed new and good condition. My boyfriend and I had the BEST time on the tour - my favourite experience in Hanoi hands down. The city looks beautiful at night but sometimes it's hard to appreciate because of how busy it is - from the back of a bike it's actually easier to relax and look around. We stopped at a few highlights like the opera house and the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum which were really pretty all lit up at night. Our guide, Nam, was th ebest, so funny and friendly with great English and loads of funny facts about Vietnamese culture. There was a structure to the tour and lots of relevant info but we also just chatted a lot and Nam would share whatever popped into his head - which was a great way to find out more about the culture!The food was absolutely fantastic - loved the coffee shop to start, the fresh spring rolls, and the final dinner - WOW! SO much food - delicious!The staff were wonderful, we loved the drivers. Had an absolutely amazing time from start to finish. Don't miss it!"

Was pleasantly surprised as they (all 5 lovely ladies & 2 tour leaders) turned up early at the hotel and arranged a customised Pho Bo breakfast (not part of the tour) for us. Certainly does go the extra mile to please customers. The tour guide was very enthusiastic (Thang if I recall correctly) and my motorbike driver, Mic was very entertaining. Had a very good tour around the city on the motorbike which is unique and covered more ground in 3 hours than we would have if we went on foot. Good introduction to Hanoi with the tour leader doing an amazing job over radio to the 5 of us on separate bikes. The food choices could perhaps be improved as I have tasted better food than what was given on the tour. The Vietnamese coffee stop was the highlight - in terms of meals. 1 Hang Manh & 49 Bat Dan should definitely be on the list. Lastly, I felt bad for the motorbike drivers as they had to wait for us in most of the food stops (except the last one) when they should be joining us at every stop. That way it would facilitate more interaction between the tour guides and the tourists."

We agree with other reviews that it would be good to do early in your stay as you can return to some of the sights later if you wish.

On our last day in Hanoi, we did a day time tour and it was a real highlight, and worth every cent. The historical and cultural narrative via headsets was very informative and quite fascinating. The tour around the old quarter was great and West Lake even better as we had not had a chance to see it before. The best would have to be going to local eateries though, and really feeling part of it all. The tour guide and riders were excellent, and I highly recommend, one of our highlights from our two week trip for sure, and definitely would do it again! I'd recommend doing it early in you stay if possible, as it gives you a really good overview of the place."

When researching which company to chose there are many in Vietnam but from the moment I spoke with Alan on Viber I felt at ease.We decided on the 6 day Hi Giang which suited the budget and time frame I had. Thon is an absolute champion and very knowledgable with the region, answering all 'touristy' questions we had! Nothing was a problem and he bent over backwards for us from start to finish.The accommodation was fantastic and varied which makes you appreciate the different regions. Each morning Thon gave the brand new bikes a quick once over and sprayed a bit of chain lube before we headed out. The XR150's were a bit of an adjustment from what we are used to in Australia but did the trick.Thon let us set our own pace each day (fast and slow!!) depending on how many rice wines we had the night before and he even found a challenging trail he hadn't done before so we were quiet privileged.Stop and take as many or few photos as you like and Thon knows all the great spots to pull up for beautiful scenery shots and wicked GoPro footage.All in all, a fantastic professional company with relaxed feel, quality equipment, organised staff and very adaptable.

From booking, throughout the tour, and even after.First, the owner Alan, was awesome to work with. I called last minute, the day before I arrived in Hanoi. Alan took time to meet me ahead of time and we even had some Pho and coffee when I arrived to plan the trip.During the trip, Tom was awesome. We covered a lot of ground together and Tom is a great rider. He captured some great footage and knew the terrain and towns very well. From mud, to gravel, to pavement, to dirt roads and single track trails, we had some great riding . We even had the chance to stop and watch a lightning storm. Thank you again Tom! The bikes were great, brand new Honda CRF250. Perfect bike for the tour, and easy to handle in Hanoi traffic on the way out and back.At the end of the trip, Tom and Alan and I hung out a little and they even recommended some cool things to do by my hotel. Alan, edited a custom video of my two days riding and sent it to me within a day after we were done. I would definitely go out again and do more than a two day tour. Can't wait until I am back in Vietnam!"

We were total beginners and were given high quality protective gear, plenty of time in the quite area by the office to get used to the bikes and a fantastic guide Tan. All of this made us feel as safe as possible. The tour itself was so much fun, perfect guide, friendly locals, incredibly scenery and great accommodation. Definitely the best way to see the Vietnamese landscape and get off the beaten track. Thanks so much Alan and Tan, can't wait to come back and try some bigger bikes and off road adventures!! :)"

We didn't want to only see the city in Vietnam but also its beautiful countryside and natural landscape. I talked to Alan, who was also our tour guide, on Skype and he recommended us this one day trip, which is a perfect fit for beginners and who only have limited budget and time. As it was a rainy day in Hanoi, we were a bit worried about the trip. But we soon got to enjoy our ride after we met Alan and got fully protected by his well-maintained equipment. Before the main trip, we had a chance to practice our driving skills with the scooters, which were all well maintained. We soon started off to the countryside, and the rain stopped. The road type on the trip was very diverse including high way, concrete countryside roads, muddy small roads in the rice fields, mountain and coastal road etc. On the trip we also visited an ancient temple and Alan was very knowledgable and able to answer all the questions about the local culture and history. The lunch was perfect with all the varieties of meat and vegetable and was offered in a family style village house. (It was a unesco village.) The view on the trip was fantastic with the mountains, old villages, rivers, rice fields, bridges etc.The tour guide is responsive, skillful, friendly and speaks perfect English. I highly recommend this trip if you want to have an understanding of the countryside in Vietnam and you only have limited time and experience in motorcycle. They also have longer trips too."

My wife had very little experience on two wheels, and was nervous in general driving around Vietnam. I explained this to Alan, and he designed a day trip for the two of us around showing her how fun the independence of a motorcycle is! She took a fully automatic scooter and I hopped on a CRF250. We spent the whole day traveling through the country side, both off and on road, and seeing, smelling, and feeling amazing things. We even got to experience some hectic Vietnam traffic on the way home, with Alan leading/blocking for us. Overall, highly recommended for a few things: flexibility of payment methods, taking the wife on a training run in the morning to make sure she was comfortable, taking tons of photos/videos all day and providing them within 24hrs, supplying clothes and shoes, bikes in great condition, quality of route, frequency of breaks, giving us beers after a long day on the bike, and most of all the great attitude."

He taught us how to ride 125cc Honda scooters and we took off for the country side. Alan tailors each ride to the riders' experience levels. He took us through back roads that were fun but challenging. It was a perfect ride for two beginners who wanted to develop their riding skills. While on the tour, we saw temples that you would expect to see on a bus tour of the countryside around Hanoi. We also saw small villages and countryside that are inaccessible by bus and too far to reach by pedal bike. I'd recommend this tour to anyone. Alan is a pleasure to work with."

Not to mention cameraman (he never misses a photo opportunity!)- visiting the paddy fields and working areas along with all the wild life that you could ONLY ever experience as a tourist by dirtbike (you'd never get to these places on any other means of transport other than foot)- Sharing a mini- keg of beer at the end of the day and laughing about the days goings on.Overall, the best day out you could imagine. From meeting Alan over a coffee in the morning to sharing a beer at the end of the day. And ... My wife Karen loved her first motorcycle pillion experience.

Our trip was a 6 day loop from Hanoi to Sapa. Traveling by motorbike, I don't think there is a better way to experience the scenery, people and culture that the Vietnam countryside has to offer. Small village stops for coffee in the morning, cool drinks throughout the day and simple but incredible lunches. Home stays with local families top off the cultural experience.Other than a really sore backside after 6 days..... There is nothing about this trip that did not exceed our expectations.Thanks Alan, hope to see you soon."

I was in Hanoi and having a hard time adjusting to the time difference so I was on Trip Advisor looking for what I was going to do when the sun came up. I stumbled on to this and knew I wanted to do it. Most companies in Hanoi will allow you to be passengers but here you can actually operate your own vehicle. I emailed Alan that morning and was pleasantly surprised with quick emails and a plan for the day ahead. Alan called my hotel and even spoke to the cab driver to ensure I got to where I needed to go to meet up with him at his shop. We spent the day riding around the country side and stopping at various locations to eat and drink (all included with the price!)We rounded out our day with a swim at a local beach on the Red River where it began to rain a little and a beautiful rainbow followed us for the rest of our ride home. The rain, the traffic, the country, the people were all things I wouldn't have been able to see without this amazing opportunity. Now that I am back home in the States, it is still one of my biggest highlights of the trip, next time I will make it longer, I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone, with any experience. I had grown up on dirt bikes but after years of not using a clutch I actually had a hard time getting back into it, so we both decided to be on the safe side and I rode an automatic scooter, and it was a blast knowing I was safe and in control. I don't feel like I missed out on much. A true highlight of my time in Vietnam. THANK YOU ALAN!"

You won't see tourists and it's very authentic in terms of the sites and stops for morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea. The route goes mostly off-road and therefore going by car can't compete with what you'll see by bike. It's a great compact way to see a whole lot of VN in one day. I personally found the route along the flood bank of the red river back to Hanoi just as interesting as the countryside and villages we visited. The bikes are top notch and new.

Alan was very quick to respond to emails and answer all of our questions. We would ride the following day with Alad and one other rider. We stayed in the old quarter and getting to Alan's shop required a 30 min taxi ride (plan for between $5 and $8 depending on traffic, Uber is a cheaper option). Make sure you have some way of contacting Alan on the way...his shop is a little tricky to find.Before setting off we chose our bikes and gear (he has autos for those not comfortable on manual bikes but this limits the terrain you can ride through). We had about 15 min to ride around a quiet block to get comfortable with the bikes before setting off. We had a fantastic time atop 125cc dirt bikes, riding through rice patties and local streets and alleyways (complete with cows, geese, buffalo, kids), and last but not least full on Hanoi traffic!There were many stops, for example a visit to a 1000 yr old temple, a delicious lunch in a UNESCO designated house, a roadside stop to watch people at work planting rice, not to mention a few refreshments along the way (coconut, Bia Hoi). Alan was friendly, knowledgable, and took great pictures and videos of our ride. The bikes were in fantastic condition, as was other gear (helmets, gloves, and optional shin and arm guards). We were a group of three, all with limited dirt bike experience (my friend and I had taken a two-day course several months ago, that was the extent of our dirt bike experience), and so Alan kept the route at a level we could all manage. A word of warning however: no matter your level, any ride in and out of Hanoi requires spending about an hour riding through city traffic...I found this quite challenging and a bit terrifying. In the end it was exciting, I did just fine, and I'm so happy I got to experience being part of the crowd of motorbikes on the road. But before you sign up make sure you're aware of this and comfortable with the risk. Thanks so much Alan for a memorable day, one of our best in Vietnam!"

I left my last day in Hanoi unplanned, and on my ride home from Halong Bay, second to last day, I was scrolling through 'Things to Do' in Hanoi. I love a little adventure, and wanted to get outside of Hanoi and see a bit more of the countryside. I shot Alan a message, and was surprised to get a response within minutes. Booking with Alan was easy - he's very organized and succinct, and a great virtual communicator. Alan walked me through my bike options, and sent me details and cost of a one day trip. He did not require any deposit, just a 'yes,' and we made a plan to meet the following morning. The heat is intense this time of year, so we decided to meet very early, and get on our way. Alan did a great job of coordinating with my uber driver to ensure I got dropped off in the right place. He was ready to go when I arrived.Alan himself is a great guy - he's got a youthful energetic spirit, and is very enthusiastic about motorbikes. He was pretty excited to get me out on his new 2017 250cc Honda. He's also a bit of a character - he's quite into dressing up and taking funny pictures. As a result, he ended up hauling funny kids rice hats and toy spears all the way into the country side so we could do a funny photo shoot - not really my thing, but it was quite endearing how serious he was about it. Sadly, the hats didn't survive the journey back into Hanoi, as they got pulverized in his tire.The trip itself was awesome - I'm not a huge biker, but have definitely ridden bikes before. That said, navigating Hanoi morning traffic was a thrilling experience in itself. Alan is extremely conscious of his riders, he literally turned back to check on me about every 30 seconds. As chaotic as it was in the city, I always felt well looked after and very safe.The ride through the countryside was great. We made serveral stops to get local tea and coffee, and had one of the best meals for lunch that I had while in Vietnam. The heat was brutal, but that's Vietnam in June! I really loved my experience with Alan and Vietnam Motorbike Tours, and am actually considering a longer trip with him. I'd definitely recommend this, even for the not-so-serious rider, it's such a great and exciting way to get out of Hanoi and see the country a bit."

It is incredible how many places you can visit in one single day by motorbike, since waterfalls to caves seeing local villages, riding around rice fields, bridges, off road paths... an authentic vision of the deep Vietnam completely recommendable.We had the opportunity to do a Homestay with a family in a traditional house at a local village in the middle of the valley. So nice to get in contact with locals and experience a bit they way of life. Also we had the change to go to a local spa where they use water at 40\u00baC with medicinal herbs to have the best relaxing experience after a workout day on the bike.Definitely for our next visit to Vietnam we would love to repeat for more days.PROS: Everything!!! Off-road paths, hidden villages, real local food (delicious), local Spa, contact with locals, homestay, Lee (tour guide), GOPRO videos provided (with high quality), actually every minute was an awesome experience.CONS: Too short, we had only 2 days. Next time I would spend at least 10!!!Don't be afraid if your riding skills are low, After 10 minutes on the bike you'll feel really comfortable. After 1 day you can't wait for more.Thanks to Alan and Lee for your effort."

Well organised schedule, mixing on and off road through countryside and mountain passes, and great local accommodation (and rice wine!). Fantastically well looked after throughout, particularly as we aren't the most experienced riders. They supply Go Pro with guide but take your own gear if you have it. Looking forward to the vid and the Facebook Group. Overall a great adventure, enjoyed hanging out with other riders in the evening and top quality outfit to ride with.

Alan and Lee, managed to send the Bikes to Sapa for us, and Organized in a very little time an awesome tour around Sapa. The tour was totally adjusted to us, when you ride an off-road bike you need to be aware of the risks and your riding skills. Lee made a super nice personalized tour accordingly to our riding skills. We saw Towns, Rivers, Caves, Main Roads, little Roads and off-Road paths.We slept in home stay with a local family and we had and awesome shower in the public baths near the house in a very little town, we did not see a single tourist around. I've been traveling many years in many countries, and I found that this tour was totally different from the others, so we did experience more real Vietnam. If I can repeat again I would definitely take a much longer tour, so it finished so fast."

Regardless, Alan gave us his full attention when booking and coordinating the trip.Our tour guide was Lee, who was absolutely fantastic and chose some fantastic roads and routes for us from Hanoi to Hoi An. We had a couple of days of hard riding up front, but that allowed us a great balance of riding and sightseeing. He was friendly, great to hang out with, and generally very open to everything. My favorite part of the experience was the degree of flexibility we were able to have. Midway through we changed the route to visit the seaside, and shorten our time in Hue to spend more time in Hoian (which I recommend). Lee was very open to all of this, and there was obviously quite a bit of support going on in the background, as we were seamlessly checked into hotels the whole way through.The bikes we rode were great (the crf 250s) and well maintained. They obviously have great pride about their bikes, and it's unusual to see 250cc dirt bikes this well maintained in Vietnam.Will definitely be coming back, next time for the gorgeous looking off-road in Northern Vietnam."

We had no idea what to expect about 1) Vietnam 2) motorbiking through a new country, which began in the intimidating hyper-cycle town of Hanoi and 3) \"homestays\". I must say the owner Alan and our personal guide Heon made us feel comfortable and relaxed every step of the way... minus the Hanoi rush-hour traffic, which they tried to avoid! Vietnam is a breathtakingly beautiful country with a contrastingly gorgeous countryside opposite the bustling city of Hanoi. There was something about gliding through the streets and side roads on a motorbike that magnified that experience. I felt like I was a more connected part of the city and the villages, not just a passer-by on a bus staring out a window on a foreign land. After a few hours of \"sea-legs\" on the motorbike, the shifting, the throttle, the brakes all became second nature and I began to enjoy the sites more acutely. And just when your buns begin to tire from the saddle, you park your bike at a HOMESTAY, shower and enjoy home cooked fresh Vietnamese cuisine. We would call it \"farm-to-table\" in the states, but in Vietnam, the family grows the rice/veggies/meat, harvests, prepares, cooks and serves it up to guests daily just like they do for themselves. It's an incredible way to experience family, culture, food, village-life, and an entirely authentic Vietnamese slice of life. (Including Heon's wonderful family where we had the best food, rice wine and enjoyable overall overnight experience) I've run on enough about this, but I've told everyone that will listen in the states about my trip, and I cannot wait until my next longer, more rural trip with Alan, Heon and the gang. Alan & Heon (and all your support staff), you've captured magic in a bottle, keep it up!! Sincerely,Jeremy"

Endless rice fields, ducks, dogs, super friendly people along the way - I loved the feel of it. Alan took me down a few easy but fun off road trails, and knew all the roads very well, so I felt like I was in good hands the whole time. And he was patient and helpful with navigating, making the route back as easy as possible (the last 30 min getting back to the city are a bit tense because of city traffic, but manageable - you'll feel accomplished by the end). The bike was pretty much new, in excellent condition and comfortable, which helped a lot - infinitely better than the standard motorbike rental fare.

This was the first time I had done anything like this in my life I have ridden bikes all of my life but nothing like this, I knew the planning that goes into organising a trip like this would have to be spot on so my first contact with Alan proved that this was a well organised trip run by very experience people and every detail had and would be looked after. The contact with Allen from day one was excellent and always made contact with me to make sure I was ok. So from day one of the trip I felt very comfortable and was pleased with what we were about to do and it was a trip of a life time!! From time Cuong picked me up at the hotel to the time he dropped me off I had the time of my life. Coung was the best guide and looked after every need we had his local knowledge is second to none and we went to places most people wont get to see, the accommodation was excellent and the local food was beautiful. If you haven't ridden a bike before in heavy traffic then you need to practice before you arrive because it can be a bit over whelming but the guides will get you through. If you ever want to test yourself and put yourself out of your comfort zone and still have an amazing trip then this is for you. The bikes are in excellent condition and we did 1500klms and only had two flat tyres so they are very reliable and you also have a very good mechanic with you as well. I will be heading back within the next year to do it all again. Thanks Alan for a great trip!!"

Cold for the first few days in the mountains but by the time we reached Sapa and nearer the Chinese border the riding conditions were ideal with sunshine, challenging back roads and fabulous mountain scenery.Heading east and tracking near to the China border the mountain scenery becomes even more dramatic with unique geogological rock formations and everywhere hardworking small colourful communities scratching a meagre living from the hostile terrain.Communication, route finding, local meals, accommodation etc are all sorted out in an efficient and friendly way by our excellent Vietnamese tour guides.Highlights were Sapa with its dramatic tea plantations plus cable car to the indochina highest peak, visit to the China border at Lao Cai, miles of off road tracks around Dong Vang, river crossings , time with the remote mountain communities and an early morning cruise on the amazing Ba Be lake.Alan Tours are a great company for a motorbike adventure trip! highly recommended, Jerry."

No hidden fees, very convenient to pay the deposit up front and allowed us to pay the rest on the day of. You can tell he cares a lot about his business and the customer service is top notch.We were very lucky in having Vuong as our tour guide. I use the term tour guide loosely as I felt more that he was an old local friend who was showing us around! Vuong picked us up from the hotel and even brought us to an amazing coffee shop by their office. We got to meet the team and try a local breakfast. They also educated us on the different coffee grades in Vietnam.Once we arrived, they got us equipped with riding gear and assessed our riding abilities. We had 3 guys who were fine and 2 girls who were complete newbies. Us gals determined that we did not feel 100% confident in riding in the rain during Tet Traffic so Vuong allowed for us to ride along as passengers. (VERY NICE as I know 6 hours with a passenger can be rough haha) We embarked on our 2 Day journey to Mai Chau for a homestay.Once we got out of city traffic, Vuong knew the back ways to get to Mai Chau. It was BEAUTIFUL and so scenic. Very enjoyable. I went in winter so it was actually pretty cold. They are very good about answering questions so feel free to ask what you should pack and expect.Vuong is funny as heck. It was really great having him as he is so well informed but also has a great sense of humor. We went dirt biking a bit as the rain provided us with some nice mud to play with. VERY FUN! We also loved the fact that he is very go with the flow and always asks what you prefer to do. The food and coffee stops along the way are also quite good! We got to eat with the locals eat and they do ask you of any preferences or cravings if you have any. Being Vietnamese, it was really comforting to see the home cooked meals at the home stay.When we arrived to Mai Chau, we were given the option of staying in the home stay or doing the hotel for $30 more. DO THE HOMESTAY! Pics below. We did both and I will tell you that the homestay area was far more comfortable than it looked. The blankets provided are super nice and toasty, wifi was stronger out there, the experience itself is just fun and the bathroom is NEW and clean! The only thing is on the 2 day trip, I don't feel like it was a true homestay as you aren't necessarily staying with a family but you do get wonderful service. The staff made sure you were happy and fed! You were still getting authentic food and they also gave us the sweet rice that is cooking in the bamboo- hard to find in the city! Breakfast was amazing too- they made delicious Vietnamese Banana Pancakes and we never had those in the city either!Vuong was not only a great and versed rider, but he doubles as your photographer also. He took GoPro footage for us and they make sure to get you the footage immediately after the trip. He also has an amazing eye for angles and took some breathtaking shots for us.Bike Quality- GREAT! Very safe and you can tell they take care of themTour Quality- Wish we were able to do it longer and go to Sapa! We are all going back for a longer trip and added it to the bucket list!Vuong Quality- 10. Like I said, the dude is amazing.Food Quality- Really good and nice that they were included in pricingI will note, this was a pretty long ride but to me it was worth it! They will often ask if you need breaks along the way or if you want to just stop and look at stuff. The guys enjoyed the trip thoroughly and had a ton of fun."

My personal favourite being day 5&6 - the off-road and mountain trails near the Chinese boarder heading to B\u00e1o Lac.If you're looking to do a trip like this I would suggest a minimum of 6 days. Ideal time, 8 days. Anything more is a bonus.There are so many spectacular and amazing things to see, I cannot recommend this trip enough. Trip of a lifetime."

I contacted Alan the night before my boyfriend and I wanted to go for the day trip and Alan responded straight away with all the information about the day trip. He even spoke to our receptionist at the hotel to ensure we had directions to the shop written in Vietnamese for the taxi driver. My boyfriend chose to ride the bigger 250 bike and they were in immaculate condition. I rode of the back of Alan's bike as I have never rode a bike before and was happy to sit and take pictures. Being on a motorbike is something very far out of my comfort zone, however Alan made me feel so safe, I was never worried about my safety, even riding through the busy Hanoi city. We had some amazing stops along the way including seeing areas of the country not possible without a guide. Alan spoke excellent English which was great to speak to locals. Alan was so thoughtful, always checking if we wanted a drink or a snack and there were plenty of opportunities to stop for a talk about the area. He also pointed out different crops and things that were happening along the way. The lunch was AMAZING, there was so much food and it was delicious, so were the stops for hot chocolate. I even had a turn riding on the back of my boyfriends bike which was a lot of fun. All in all, it is such an amazing experience and absolutely worth every dollar. We have been travelling through Asia for a month and this was by far the best thing we have done in our trip. You don't need to be a huge motorbike fan, like me I know very little about motorbikes and I had an absolute blast. As for our guide Alan, he was such a kind and genuine person. We decided he was the nicest person we had met on our trip. Even after the tour was over he took us for coffee and a snack and also waiting with us until we were in a taxi. He was so helpful and you could tell he really cared about us, the local people and he cares very much about making sure everyone has an awesome day. We both could not stop smiling all day, even after we were sitting in the taxi my boyfriend and I could not stop smiling. We are so glad we decided to do the tour, it was a once in a lifetime experience and I urge anyone who is thinking about doing it to give it a go and definitely use this company. The company exceeded all of our expectations. We are heading back to Australia so I can learn how to ride a motorbike, we will practice lots and then we will be back to do at least a week long tour. We just cannot get enough of it. Thank you Alan for being such a great person and we will see you again soon :)"

He made sure all my queries were answered and upto my satisfaction before booking the tour especially when I was riding motorbike with two pillions (my wife and my 5 yo daughter). Sounds crazy\u2026isni\u2019t it? :)Nevertheless, Alan gave us the confidence before booking this tour and Lee Pham, our guide and companion for 6 days, made sure that we were safe and getting the maximum out of these 6 days. Lee was friendly and patient with our hundreds of questions. Knowing that we were 3 riding on a bike he mostly kept us on-road yet made sure that we don\u2019t miss out breathtaking scenic views that the north most Vietnam had to offer. We did a little off road too on our 5th day which made our trip more memorable. The almost new Honda CRF250 could cruise royally whatever comes it\u2019s way, be it bumpy or muddy roads, riding steep uphills or on narrow bamboo bridges. All the lodging including Homestays was above our expectations and our special requirement of vegetarian food was also very well taken care. This was truly amazing and lifetime experience for all 3 of us. I will highly recommend Alan and team to anyone wanting to add an experience to cherish lifelong. Thank You guys. Hope I come back soon for a offroad biking experience again.-Kawal"

We were casually skimming what to do in Hanoi while sitting at a cafe and we came across this -- a day trip out of Hanoi and into the countryside on bikes! And the tour was great. We crawled and bounced through paddy fields, mud tracks, villages. Our lunch was at a UNESCO heritage village and it was most superb. Best beef dumplings I have ever eaten. But what was the best was Alan, our guide. Helpful and ever-smiling, Alan is a great guide. He knows all the roads like a map in his head and is the best to have around when your bike is stuck in mud. Because he will just laugh it off AND help you dig the bike out.Just one note -- probably better to take a motorbike than a scooter because we had trouble navigating scooters on the muddy roads. Have fun!"

They will go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and having a good time. The tour itself was amazing. We did a three day Northern Vietnam trip. Picture yourself on a bike on mountain roads, dodging the occasional chicken and water buffalo. Try not to smile when you pass groups of children all cheering as you pass by their village! The scenery was breathtaking and the people were some of the nicest we've met in Southeast Asia.The food was delicious. We ate home-cooked meals that were as fresh as you could get. We stayed at a beautiful homestay and an upscale hotel for the two nights on the tour. They were wonderful.The bikes were in superb condition - you can tell they take pride in their bikes.All in all, if you're coming to Vietnam, I highly, highly recommend doing a motorbike tour through this company. If you don't have a lot of time, they offer even smaller trips than our 3 day trip. Or if you're interested in longer trips, they do those too. We had a once in a lifetime experience and it was all thanks to Vietnam Motorbike Tours! The only regret was that we didn't book a longer trip!!!"

We stopped for plenty photos and Alan took lots on his camera and GoPro and sent me a video of the day. Coming back into Hanoi at rush hour is definitely an experience but you soon see there is method to the madness that is the Hanoi roads!As total beginners this was challenging enough to still be great fun and my gf who is scared of everything loved this day out and we would both recommend itAlan is a great guide, chatty and funny and speaks good EnglishChris"

From the minute we hopped on the bikes it was an adventure. Unfortunately, it was raining in the morning and we got soaked as we rode along but it did not dampen our spirits and eventually the rain and our clothes dried up. My husband rode by himself and I with Alan. As we rode along Alan pointed out different tidbits I would not have noticed if not riding with him. We rode through the city and into the countryside where we did not see another tourist for the rest of the day!! We rode through small trails, some that we even created ourselves, dirt roads, small bridges and paved roads where we met locals, farmers and children. We stopped and ate lunch at a wonderful homestay and had some of the most delicious food of our entire stay in Vietnam. On our way back into the city we rode through a flower village and into Hanoi at peak rush hour which was a thrill and adventure in itself. We ended the day by having a beer with Alan and rehashing our amazing day. This was our favorite thing we did during our entire month long tour throughout Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. We loved Alan's enthusiasm and love for what he does. He tries to make each tour different and took us on new trails/routes he had never driven before where we met some of neatest and excited people. Overall, an amazing day and experience. We'd love to do it again!!"

Neither my wife nor I had riding experience. That didn't matter. After some training, I felt comfortable navigating both the streets of Hanoi and the countryside. And my wife decided she felt more comfortable riding with Alan, which allowed her to take in more of the sights.Alain took us to towns that were not on most tourists' itineraries. We saw pagodas surrounded by water. We stopped for Vietnamese coffee, bananas and coconuts. And we rode on narrow country backroads, passing ducks, roosters, cows and water buffalo. At every stop, the locals knew (and cleared loved) Alan and couldn't have been friendlier to us.A few things in particular stood out:- Because it was a few days before Christmas, Alan dressed up as Santa Claus. Needless to say, children were delighted as he sped past them on his motorbike.- Alan understands that everyone wants photos to post to social media and share with friends. He made sure to document every moment of our trip--even capturing video and taking selfies while we were riding.- If you show some proficiency as a rider, Alain will take you on more challenging trails. On one narrow curve. I took a spill. I was worried he'd be upset or concerned about the bike, but he couldn't have been nicer. He joked that I wasn't quite ready for my Vietnamese license yet, helped me up, and we were on our way.Yes, it's a little more expensive than some other activities, but worth every penny. Motorbiking with Alan is the perfect mixture of adventure and sightseeing. Highly recommended."

Our accommodation was in home stays and hotels which were clean and had hot showers waiting for us at the end of each day. The days were not long or tiring with lots of breaks to take photos,have morning tea or sumptuous lunches, I never thought I would see the day when us boys would not finish all the food placed in front of us, there was so much! and good food it was to ( oh! Those crispy pork ribs). The dinners just as good with cold beers and no rush to find our beds, Quinny would leave us to wander the town and find somewhere for coffees ( or more beers),meet locals who were so friendly. The scenery on our ride was amazing and changed each day with some off road riding to take us to places off the beaten track, we crossed over rivers on bamboo bridges and over mountains where the clouds were below us. Our trip was safe and comfortable thanks Alan ( and Quinny) for a fantastic trip I shall not forget.Tips: wear sun glasses especially if you ride with the visor up (I do that).Film everything, every time I turned off my Go Pro I wish I didn't."

The hard mattresses in Vietnam were something I was not prepared for, but many places had doonas which could be doubled over and used for mattress padding. Our travel route was not a set itinerary, and Lee changed a few days to avoid the rough tracks off-road being too uncomfortable for 3 blokes in their late 60s...also it looked like rain around Sapa. A hint for old buggers like me...buy a small cushion for your bum on the wooden seats at coffee and lunch stops."

Within 20 minutes of taking off, we were out of the city centre and riding along rice fields and around cows. It was surreal. The whole day flew by so quickly and the countryside was beautiful. We really got a sense of what village life was like and everyone we met was so friendly. We went through villages where motorbikes weren\u2019t that common and the kids were so interested in how the bikes worked. Lunch was the highlight of the day at the Ancient Village. So much food was brought out and it was true home cooking. We had many stops throughout the day for breaks, snacks and photos. He introduced us to food and tea made in the area at each stop. Alan also knows exactly where and when to stop for the perfect photos.

All great.Roads were truly world class, snaking corners were the norm, with both smooth, bumpy, deadly and everything in between. Followed rivers, ridge lines and drove back roads and lanes. Wore protective clothing and good boots. After 8 days we pulled up back at Hanoi, all safe and spent, but with retired brains and infinitely the richer for the experience.The tour went real smooth with the guides Vuong and Lee both working hard on our behalf, with Fouk in the truck lifting loading and following some serious track.Bike days were long, but for so connected to your inner soul that we arrived more enlivened that when we left. I would advise you encourage the guides to stop more and talk to locals, its worth it. If you don't want serious hours of bike time, maybe take bikes on train to SaPa and start there.Bring a go pro or similar plus a 1 terabyte hard drive to download the cards. The views are everywhere. Don't overthink it. Just book, pay and go. You won't be disappointed."

However, the contact person instructed not so clear, by just asking us to tell the taxi driver to send us to the University. On our way, we use our mobile phone to call the shop and let him communicate with our taxi driver. We assume they gave a very clear direction to the driver. (That spent us few dollars for IDD call) But unfortunately, when we arrived in University, no one show up. We lost in University. Even worse, due to poor signal, we cannot dail to the shop. Finally, we were lucky that we found a student to help us make the call to the shop (Vietnamnese is helpful and friendly actually ). Alan then came to pick up us. Originally I plan to give 5 stars but given this poor start, I remove one stars by only rating Four finally. I would say, if they could provide pick up / drop off service that would be much better.

Alan gave us automatic 125cc, a 'boy's bike' as he put it! They were essentially mopeds and very easy to handle and drive. After a quick 20 minute drive around the office area, we were off, and on some pretty busy roads out of Hanoi!Our guide for the day was See (i'm sure I've spelt this incorrectly). He was very knowledgable and also fun. He was always happy to stop whenever we wanted and take our pic. There were plenty of stops along the way; temples, villages, beer breaks etc.Driving back into hanoi as the sun was setting was one of the most exhilarating hours of my life, a great trip and great memories. I hope I can come back again and do a longer tour. Thanks guys!"

If you are wanting to get out into the countryside and experience the 'real' Vietnam without hoards of tourists, then you'd be mad not to book a Motorbike tour with Alan and his team. I can't ride a motorbike so opted to ride pillion on the back of Alan's bike whilst my husband spent 20 minutes refreshing his biking skills before we headed out. Alan's knowledge of the roads and trails is amazing and we saw parts of the countryside you'd never see by car. There were plenty of opportunities to stop for refreshments (all included in the cost of the tour) as was any entrance fees to the temples we visited.Alan made the tour really interesting and ensured he tailored it perfectly to our needs. We found the Vietnamese people we met throughout the day incredibly friendly and hospitable - everyone has a smile for you.Our only regret is we didn't have time to do a 2 or 3 day tour but definitely plan to come back to to do a longer trip."

Since the get go Alan was most helpful and accommodating to my interests and how to customize his tours to my needs.Finally we first did the Ha Long Bay one day tour, with Duong Tien Sy, a friendly, fluent in English & knowledgeable tour guide. The trip back and forth to Ha Long was around 3 hours each way, which we did in a comfortable SUV they sent with its own driver. The whole Ha Long experience was magical, the weather was good, the yatch we sailed, the gorgeous views of the bay and the food served in the yatch.It couldn't have been any better. I strongly recommend both the tour guide and the company for arranging these trips.The next day I did the motorbike tour, which I wanted shortened due to my time limitation, yet Alan, who came along with us this time, made the best out of the day. Driving in Ha Noi and on the highways to the countryside it was yet another great experience, which for me, I had only ridden a Vespa in Rome a while back, yet he was able to guide me and teach what i needed to know yet making it interesting and adventurous to my friend Gonzalo, who is an avid bike rider.Enjoyed very much going through the neighboring farmers villages, rice plantations...and the a heavy downpour of rain came...even in muddy terrains, for this inexperienced motorcycle driver, it was fun and safe...I will do it again..but not as short...perhaps do a couple of days of touring...with Alan of course... I highly recommend this tour as well.Thanks for everything Alan!!! i will surely be back for more... Good luck!"

            "review": "11 day tour of North Vietnam!! Spectacular!. There are adventures, epic experiences, once in a lifetimes and then there is this. This may get kind of lengthy but I believe our (my brother and I) experience/skill level will appeal to many so please read if you are considering. We did the 11 day tour of northern Vietnam and we booked 2 days before we decided to go. I don't recommend that as most book months in advance. We did our trip on the fly and Alan was incredible throughout the entire booking process. First off, my brother and I have never rode a motorcycle prior to this trip, correction the day we booked this trip we went on a day tour of Vietnam with another company on semi-automatic scooters/\"motorcycles\", basically the majority of what you see around Vietnam. So that was the extent of our riding experience. We told Alan that we are truly beginners and he responded \"no problem, we will practice before you go\". Li (our tour guide for the trip) picked us up from our hotel and we met Alan at the shop. By the way, Li is absolute incredible from a tour guide perspective and more so as a person, more to come later. Luckily Alan had motorbike pants and some boots (life savers) that fit both of us. We practiced around a stadium for about an hour, stalling, shifting, downshifting, braking, all that you would guess. And then...we were off! Sounds crazy right? One hour of practice and then we were off on this 1,100 mile journey over 11 days. Well, I have to say it was the most incredible \"thing\" I've ever done and experienced in my entire life and will say it will be almost impossible to beat. Each day we probably rode 100 to 150 miles or 150 - 240 km, averaging around 100 miles most days. We were not experienced enough to go off-roading, which was completely fine. We drove through heat, rain, construction sites, rivers, over-flooded roads, rocks, dirt, mud, everything under the great blue sky. I'm going to guess 70% or so of the driving was up and down mountains. We stopped along the way to take in the incredible sights. We took breaks every 30 miles or so to stretch our legs and give the rear end a break. We stopped in small villages that otherwise tour buses,etc. would not. My brother and I are Americans but Indians (from India) by origin. Many of the people have never seen Indians before and were so curious and just amazingly welcoming. We stayed at 6 hotels and 4 homestays, one of which was with Li's family in Sapa. Li's family is just incredible as Li. We played with the little kids, ate great home cooked meals, took a herbal bath (absolute must in Sapa). Li also picked great spots for lunch and dinner. Ok, so the obvious questions that we had that I'm sure if you're reading you have. Is it dangerous? Relatively but also not. I can't explain it but after a few days you definitely feel more comfortable but trust me when I say this, you will be reminded of your inexperience very quickly. You will constantly over take semi's, cars, bikes, buffaloes, cows, etc. I had to dodge a massive jack fruit that came rolling down the mountain. Sometimes you'll ponder \"why did that rooster just run right across my bike!?!\" Well, to get the other side of course. Simply put, there are inherent dangers but Li does a great job understanding your skill level and what you are comfortable with. Be smart and be confident. I tipped over on a sharp uphill hairpin turn (day 5) because I did not downshift as I came to almost a complete stop making that turn. My bike stalled and I simply tipped over. My first \"fall\". It messes with your head a little bit but you have to get back on and shrug it off. Of course, medical help is far and few between. I'm not trying to scare anyone but that is the reality. So just be smart with your riding decisions. This trip is worth cancelling anything else you have planned and booking with Alan and co. What to bring? Since Alan had riding pants for us we wore those every day. We brought a few long sleeve dry fit type shirts. 5 pairs of underwear, 3 pairs of socks (bring more pairs of socks if you can). Pair of shorts to sleep in and couple t-shirts. Alan also gave us rain jackets, thank god! Oh! Bring a pair of comfortable light pants. When you are relaxing after a long day at the hotel/homestay it would be nice to have your legs covered. I left my pants back at Alan's office and just got bit up by mosquitoes. Bring repellent, goes without saying. Boots were key and once again we got from Alan. You can probably purchase some gum boots or something but for these long trips it is highly recommended that you have something better than sneakers. At least that's my suggestion because we drove through mud, rain, a river. Eventually it will all get wet but just feels more stable. A scarf! or something that wraps around your mouth/nose. We did not have a scarf and it would definitely have been helpful to over the nose and mouth. The helmets cover both but the dust and smoke from cars/bikes, etc. Overall, this was just something I can't explain until you do it. It is worth every penny and I mean it when I say to cancel whatever else you have and book this trip. I believe the 6 day is the most popular out of the longer day trips but if you can stretch it out to 11 days...this is it. The scenery after Sapa and the ride is just incredible. If you can get Li...get Li. Book in advance so you can secure his services. You ride about 6 hours a day. Leave around 8 or 9am and get to the next \"city\" around 3pm. A lot of time to talk and get to know Li (it was just the 3 of us on this tour). He's an incredible person and answered all of our questions about Vietnam, his life, struggles, etc. This is were the experience takes its true value. The people, the culture, the food, what you get to see because you did all this on a bike. You'll never regret it. Work two jobs when you get back home if you have to but if you are even remotely thinking about taking this trip...just do it! Hope this helps! Oh, and pack some toilet paper in your backpack and hand sanitizer."

We were apprehensive about it as we drove through Hanoi in our taxi to Alan's shop... There's millions of bikes on the roads and it looks scary! However, Alan gave us time to get comfortable on our bikes before heading off into traffic, and to be honest once you're in the traffic it's not so bad! So if you're worried like we were, don't be you will be fine. The countryside outside Hanoi is beautiful and really peaceful, the people out there are so happy to see foreigners (which gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside!) and in general they are just lovely people and for me they were the true highlight of the day. We would never had these interactions on a bus tour, we only came across 1 other small group of tourists at a unesco site and that was it. I cannot recommend it highly enough, do yourself a favour and just book it but do more than one day- you won't be sorry!Alan is great and he did so much for us today, we didn't have to worry about anything at all - He took loads of photos of us throughout the day and also a video too.

If you are also like me and hate tours in general, don't worry. The tour is not a touristy-tour, it's more like going on an day-long joyride with a good friend who is flexible to your needs.We had a seamless experience doing something we have 0 experience doing, thanks to Alan's expertise and professionalism.Tips: Don't forget to bring extra sunblock like I did (Alan was kind enough to take us to a shop mid-tour to buy sleeved clothing).

Alan is such a terrific guy and kept in contact on Facebook to make sure that I was all ready for the trip. The motorcycles we used were terrific. Dirt bikes are not common in Vietnam so everyone looks at you like a celebrity when driving though small towns. Booking the longer trip allowed me to stay in really cool locations. The home stays and hotels were so nice. This is the real way to see Vietnam. It felt weird to come back and see all the western tourists. In the countryside the scenery is incredible and the people are so friendly. One of the highlights was definitely the food. It is included in the trip price and every meal is a feast! I got to eat so many incredible things and ate so much! Vietnamese food is of course delicious. Our guide Cuong is such a terrific person. He is so friendly, intelligent, and responsible. He kept us safe and happy the whole time. Really see if you can have him as your guide if you book a trip. (You should!)All in all, this was some of the most fun I've ever had.

I did find the traffic at the end of the tour a bit intimidating but Alan was very helpful and patient with guiding us through it. Heavy traffic only lasted for around 10 minutes. I had a fantastic day and would love to do a longer trip in the future to see more of this beautiful country."

Hanoi is great, but the truth is that most of Vietnam is the countryside and the best way to see the beautiful countryside is by motorbike. Alan's tour took us through the countryside around Hanoi, visiting rice fields and other agriculture, as well as temples, pagodas and a local swimming hole for a relaxing afternoon cool down. All of these would have been almost impossible to reach without the bike. While we were beginners, the bikes were very easy to ride (we had automatic) and riding in the crazy Vietnamese traffic for a short period at the start and end was not too daunting. Alan took us at our own pace and was always ready to help. Best of all, Alan is very down-to-earth and personable with a great sense of humour! Highly recommended to anyone who wants to see REAL Vietnam away from the standard tourist haunts."

This tour was the last tour we booked on our 2 weeks trip through South East Asia. Unfortunately for us we were delayed on one of our other tours which shortened the motorcycle tour for from two days to one. Regardless Alan was excited and ready to take us on his tour. My friend was not well versed with motorcycles and Alan expressed to him not to worry, he would be giving him a lesson a couple hours before the tour. This already gave showed me that Alan was a cool guy and was looking just to have some fun. After sizing us up for our gear (Helmet, Gloves). My girlfriend needed to get used to her moped so Alan went through the controls with her and had her ride up and down the street a few times before we left. So that she was comfortable before we embarked on our amazing adventure. I jumped on my new Honda CFR250L amazing bike! (going to buy when I return home). So we traveled through a low traffic University campus then through a few low traffic lights. Alan leading and Duong following up the rear to making sure that no one was left behind. About 10min later we were on dirt and heading right down the rice paddies. AMAZING!!!! 6 more hour of remote off the beaten path riding through many small villages, rice terraces, bridges, ducks, cows, eating a snack at a local store, pagodas, temples, taking a break and eating lunch at a historical house, up close and personal with water buffalo, did I saw rice paddies?, playing soccer with locals on their field, having a drink on the side of the road, swimming in a secret spot in the Red River, sunsets to die for!! I can go on!!! Let me just tell you where I went wrong... Settle in the town for a day then go directly on this trip 2 day or a week if time permits. This ride was so amazing I kick myself for not giving myself the time to spend the full two days. We got so much out of the one Day, that my girlfriend and I are talking about our return trip and 1 week tour with Alan & Duong. I can say that this tour alone will show more around Vietnam that you can do in a vehicle or on foot in a week. You also get a chance to escape from the crowds and experience the people and culture one on one. Alan and Duong are very knowledgable about their lands and tons of facts and history to share. Duong always is there with the camera so you can put yours away and just ride, just taking a few shots when we stop whenever you feel like stopping. I can't wait for my next tour!Advice on items to bring:\u2022 Sunscreen \u2022 Mini backpack (waters + stuff + extra clothing & swimsuit)\u2022 Sunglasses\u2022 Long sleeve shirt (Breathable / Thin)\u2022 Camera\u2022 Scarf\u2022 Smile"

VN OFFROAD were very professional to deal with when booking our tour from Australia. They would always get back to you within one day and answer all your questions. Nothing is too hard for the crew at VN OFFROAD. Our guide (Michael Hue) is a man who is very passionate about Vietnam. He is a very experienced tour guide and made our trip better than we imagined. Michael Hue would organise everything from meals, to hire bikes, mechanic, drinks, trips to museum, help with shopping where there might normally be a language barrier - whatever request we had Michael Hue would deal with straight away. I cannot recommend VN OFFROAD highly enough for your trip to Vietnam. Whether it's a walking/shopping tour of Hanoi - or a hard core dirt bike adventure. VN OFFROAD are the crew you need to speak to.

My only experience riding a scooter was in Chiang Mai for about an hour, 6 years ago! That being said, I killed it! haha Even when we rode home in the twilight and my headlights were sporadically turning off, our other guide Sy led us carefully back to the shop on calmer streets, as we returned to bustling Hanoi. I always felt safe and looked after and am now eager to learn how to ride a manual dirt bike before my next visit - so I can get even MORE ACTION on a longer excursion.I had an absolute blast tearing up the backroads we were taken on, through rice paddies and duck farms and small towns with the most beautiful, uncrowded pagodas. We had lunch at a local family's 400yo home and it was delicious. I still think about that pumpkin! I haven't heard of any other tour that gets you this close to the real Vietnam. And Alan is such a pleasure to ride and talk with, very knowledgeable and encouraging, he's the perfect tour guide. I think we will be friends for a long time.Our tour ended with a dip in the river at sunset. SO BEAUTIFUL!!! I thought I must be dreaming. It truly was the best day and fully encompassed my newfound love affair with Vietnam, especially Hanoi and the north. I can't wait to return! Thanks again, Alan and Sy. You guys ROCK!"

The trip from start to finish was world-class. Cuong gave us lessons on how to operate the dirt bikes prior to leaving, and let us practice in a nearby neighborhood before heading out. I was nervous as I had never driven a bike before, but he was patient and helpful!Once we got out to the countryside, we were greeted with sprawling green views of the rice paddies and surrounding villages. We never went too fast and always focused on safety. Cuong spoke fantastic English and gave us the history of each location we stopped at. We saw a 1000 year old pagoda, rice fields being planted, ate at a 400 year old guest house, and saw the tomb of a king during our trip. We got home and there was a cold bottle of water and a beer waiting for us. If you are looking for something to do outside of the city, and you want to take a break from the hustle of downtown and get back to nature, this is the trip for you. It was worth every single penny and I would do it again if I had the chance!"

I don't have any riding experience but he was more than happy to show me the ropes and gave me the option to either ride my own bike (taking quiet roads and going slowly), or being a passenger on his amazing Honda CRF 250cc (going quicker and having fun) - I opted for the latter of course! We saw beautiful countryside and the real Hanoi outside of the city - a total mix of modern and traditional life that I've totally fallen in love with. It was HOT so we took lots of breaks for drinks and ate a delicious Vietnamese lunch at a lovely local restaurant. Then on to more spectacular views, more off roading around farm land and villages, more Vietnamese iced coffee, and a refreshing swim in the Red River with local kids.Alan took no risks during our trip and I felt 100% safe - which is a good sign considering my only experience on bikes has been on a few motorbike taxis around Asia.

As Alan says everything is inclusive and that is absolutely delivered he pays for all expenses and breaks which occur during the trip of which there are many.1 day Hanoi trip is unbeatable for first time bikers (as long as you go in small groups or alone as lots of newbies are hard to manage for one guide) - let him know you are new before hand and he will be very patient in teaching you how to ride safely in the quiet university grounds. Alan will make sure you are will looked after during the trip always keeping and eye on you and warning you well in advance of any hazards ahead. Roads are very quiet in the rural area with a few slow driving locals, however you will have to go on the busy highway to get there. As long as you are always keeping an eye on the road Alan will do everything else for you. Alan and all the locals are extremely polite welcoming and patient with you.The trip takes you into real Hanoi where the tourist buses seldom go so this is the best way to see Hanoi. I am extremely pleased to have been lucky enough to come across this exceptional bike company don't look anywhere else. Bikes are all top notch quality to (if you're new go for the 125cc)I end the trip enlighted by The pagodas and Alan's information about them, and a much more expierenced bike rider who's had an absolute blast.Alan films the whole things with go pros and takes great pictures throughout which he sends to you at the end.

Touring by motorbike gave us access to sights that I will remember for the rest of my life, most of which would not have been possible to see on any other type of tour. Having a guide as passionate about his work and as knowledgable as Alan made a good trip great. The only thing I would do differently is to book a longer trip! Fantastic experience, one which I cannot recommend highly enough."

At first I was a bit hesitant, because I've only tried semi-automatic before and wasn't used to the clutch. In the end, I've decided to give it a shot anyway. The trip was fantastic. We visited the beautiful countryside of Hanoi and explored the rice-fields. Off-road riding was challenging and definitely tested my skills. We made a few stops on the way - at the ancient village and at a pagoda which were remarkable as well. In the end of the day, already after dawn we we fighting the evening traffic at the entrance of Hanoi, this was the most difficult part of the journey, and probably the most exciting. Overall, regardless of you enjoy riding a motorbike or not, you won't regret about taking this tour."

My wife and I joined a one day trip with Doung but, we had such a fantastic time that we are planning to come back to for a 6 days tour.Doung took us around Hanoi countryside to visit temples, agricultural areas as well as local villages via local dirt tracks and rice paddy fields . We got to see and experienced so much more of the real Vietnam than we bargained for! Everyone we met asking the trip are so nice and friendly, they have pantry if time to stop and chat to us.Doung is a fantastic tour guide. He is adventurous, fun and knowledgeable. He goes above and beyond to make your trip as enjoyable as it can be. He is a real people's person.We are looking forward to coming back and joining a 6 day trip in order to see even more of the untouched countryside.It is worth noting that I'm not an experienced rider by any means. I have had limited (very little) experience on manual bike. However, I did not have any issues with the trip."

My only downside was that I book such a short trip and wished I booked a longer trip!Right from the start communication was established and my emails would be answered very quickly and extensively; everyone at Vietnam Motorbike Tours made sure we were comfortable with everything, booked everything smoothly, and made a good transition with the visas at the airport to our hotel. Amazing communication!Since there was only 2 of us plus a guide, the rate was very reasonably higher but we got a private tour & a great bonding experience guide and all!The bikes were newer models in great condition, super durable and very comfortable to ride on \u2013 I was so surprised! Will definitely miss those bikes :)We were recommended a package since I had a hard time choosing from the many options what to do on our limited timeline \u2013 but it did not disappoint! We got to see so many things throughout our 3 day trip and our stay overnight in the homestay was so welcoming with amazing food and hospitality.Our guide was professional and extremely knowledgeable of the roads and provinces we explored, but also was riding more as our friend than guide :) He also knew all the great food places to stop by for lunch, for a snack or even for drinks whenever we wanted to stop. I had some of the best food on that trip and not in the city! Our guide was also very patient with me since I have a bad back, so stopping was encouraged whenever I needed it and made sure to stop by great viewpoints for taking pictures. He was also very patient with us riding in Hanoi as we were very nervous but made sure that we got into the office before the crazier traffic hit; what an experience!I would definitely be back for more riding and longer trips in the future with Vietnam Motorbike Tour! If you have a gopro, make sure you bring it and your accessories - they have parts attached to the tops of some helmets already, you just need your mounts! I can\u2019t wait to come back to Hanoi and experience even more thrills, beautiful landscapes and soaking in the history & culture. I highly recommend booking with Vietnam Motorbike Tours, without a doubt!"

As we only had a week in Vietnam we only booked a one day tour, however if it would have been our first day we would have cancelled our other plans and completed a 6 day tour (which we now plan to come back to do next year).Alan and his team were a pleasure to deal with and Alan was very quick in communication s including passing information to our hotel to help us out.The equipment was second to none, I was relieved to see that the helmets were the same standard as you would receive in the UK and that the bikes were the best on the market and almost brand new, clearly this company takes pride in itself.As for the trip, once we had made our way out of the city we were guided through country lanes to see local life, taken to Pagodas where the culture was explained and across off road sections to push us safely to our limits. We would stop and chat occasionally while Alan compiled a series of Go pro videos and pictures for is to remember the trip too. We stopped at a nearby village and received the best meal that we have eaten during the week here too before continueing the trip stopping for the occasional coffee.All in all an amazing day which I would highly recommend to all. Alan and his team can cater for the expert rider down to learners or can take pillion passengers for those that want the experience but do not yet have the confidence.Cancel your other plans and fit this in!"

First off, scheduling was a breeze, as a traveler you are in and out of wifi but Alan was quick with the emails. He was on time in the AM and gave me a ride to the office. I got set up with gear and a sharp looking 125CC dirt bike. I knew how to ride so there was not a major tutorial but I would imagine he is very patient with new riders.Started off in the streets of Ha Noi, and within 30-40 mins we where on calm country roads. After that we road through small towns, farms and some off road trails. Alan would stop for local food and Pagodia's if desired or would ride through for the more avid bikers.After a fun day or riding, we got back to the office, and I was treated to a beer and some snacks. Alan offered to give me a ride back to Old Quarter on a crazy saturday night, which was great cause a taxi would have taken forever.I highly recommend for beginners and seasoned riders. Note, you can customize what you want to do. Just be upfront with Alan off the bat."

March 2nd 2015.For my birthday (58th) I went motorbike riding on a Honda 125 and my wife chose to ride as a pillion passenger with our guide Alan as she had never ridden a motorbike before. It was a day trip from Hanoi out into the countryside, riding the back roads through rice fields and remote villages, through spectacular countryside. Our guide Alan was competent, well informed, extremely safety conscious. Real Vietnam, real freedom.We started on the outskirts of the city, where I got to experiance riding in the manic Hanoi traffic, what fun!. Within 30 min of setting off we were riding on back roads and out into the country side. Alan took us into the paddy fields where we rode along narrow tracks separating the fields. Everyone we met was so courteous and welcoming, we got a great sense of how hard the people work and what rural life is like. We visited pagodas, eat in a traditional restaraunt and learned about the family traditions and life in Vietnam - it was amazing and defiantly worth doing.Alan's company offers"

We then stayed in a hotel in a city further down in to the delta. Rooms were clean, and slept very well. We ventured on to a small boat and visited a the floating market which was a great experience.Travelling along country roads, and highways we were never far from good ca fe, phu, and a relaxing hammock.

That's how we met Alan, who in a few hours had given us a proposal and different options. That's where we were convinced 3 days would definitely not be enough and we embarked on a 5 day roadtrip to the north of Hanoi and chinese border. It was an amazing and breathtaking experience. Offroad Indochina is very well organized and at the same time gives you the freedom to plan the trip as you wish. All accomodations are taken care off and chosen in a way that you feel emerged into an authentic vietnamese experience. Meeting local people, no other tourists in sight, eating the best food Vietnam has to offer, breathtaking landscapes and adventurous off-road options is just a glimpse into our amazing adventure. For sure 5 days is also not enough and we would definitely like to explore the coastline and the south by motorbike next... We truly recommend Offroad Indochina for their professionalism, organization and flexibility. At the same time safety was a must for me and thanks to our very cool guide Lee, we felt super secure and taken care off at all times. Definitely a must-do when in Vietnam...even as a couple!"

My wife and I didn't have time to try out the 5/8/11 day tours that Alan had to offer (though from our interaction with him, it seems he literally could organise absolutely anything you wanted - and more!) so we stuck to the day trip visiting an ancient town and taking in the gorgeous scenery and experience en route.Things which I felt made this one of our best trips ever:1. Tour guidesAlan and his team really know their way around, from the best food and coffee stops to off-road riding routes suitable for any experience level. Alan himself took us for this tour and provided nuggets of information that made topics clear, concise and engaging. If you're a culture nut, they've got you covered. If you're big on thrills, riding the great outdoors of vietnam and soaking in parts of the country very few tourists really get to see, they've got you covered too.2. The bikesWe rode on brand new motorcycles that looked fresh off the factory belt. Alan shared his philosophy with us and made us feel very assured that safety and reliability was of paramount importance to him and his company. At no point did we feel that the brakes/chain/suspension might give way, and the bikes took everything we threw at them when we had the chance to kick up some mud down the beaten track.3. The foodHe made sure we had exactly what it was we were craving for. We said awesome fried spring rolls, and sure enough that's what we got when lunch was served. He called the restaurant beforehand to make the request, and special attention to details like that (instead of just following a fixed menu like so many other tours) really made us feel like well-taken-of tourists. and oh the coffee...4. The rideWe took the tour in December when the weather was a little chilly, dropping to a low of 11 degrees. The combination of cool, fresh air, the sun on your back, miles and miles of plantation fields ahead of you, the honking, the staring, the crunch of sand, mud, rock and grass under your wheel, winding trails that took you past villages, cemeteries, temples, narrow bridges, back alleys and the eclectic mix of aromas coming from coffee shops, street food, cow dung and the odd slash-and-burner all made for what was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the both of us. My wife particularly loved the rest stop which was off road, across a sprawling plain with just our bikes, our coffee & chocolates, the mountains and some playful cows nearby.Alan has made the start of our trip so, so difficult to beat that I'm sure I'll be utterly bored when i'm lying in my cabin on a cruise in Halong Bay tomorrow. We will most definitely be back again for the mountain tour next time!"

Alan even arranged my accommodation and taxi transfers.As for the ride - what can I say - it was one of the greatest things I have even done, I was a little apprehensive but Hoan made be very comfortable and led the way through light Hanoi traffic. once we were out of the city, the scenery, the people, the children, the homestay host - it was all perfect.There was a pleasant surprise at every turn.I did the 2 day Mai Chai tour (now wish it was longer) but It was as if the route was specifically designed for me. It is the best way to see the real Vietnam.Returning to the traffic of Hanoi - I wasn't bothered at all - in fact enjoyed that as well.I was looked after from start to finish and made to feel very welcome.I would have no hesitation recommending Vietnam Motorbike tours and look forward to returning for a longer ride."

Would definitely come back, and recommend Mr Allans company. Great communication, we were happy with all aspects of the tour.Only thing I advise is that you bring the suitable clothing with you as we were told we could get FOX gear in Hanoi but we struggled to find anything suitable for on motorbikes. And bring your own first aid kit as the guide didn't have a very good one, and chemists aren't always available!"

We hosted a conference group in Hanoi early June 2014 and must recommend this company and their staff for Motorcycle Tour arrangements around Hanoi.Whilst I did not personally ride on the tour, feedback from the delegates was all positive for their half day tour of Hanoi. The tour was a tailor made half day tour, encompassing the madness of Hanoi traffic to the calm of the farm lands, before visiting the local Snake Village. From an Event Managements perspective, Alan was very attentive to fulfilling all requests prior to the tour date. Tour arrangements is such a small portion of what we do, it helps when the provider is on the ball and able to be available to answer and questions. Well done to yourself and your team."

Our request was to take in the scenery and avoid the main routes where possible all of this was delivered. Our guide answered all of our questions regarding local life and he was particularly watchful that we remained safe and together through out the trip. Vietnam Motor bike tours arranged a trip that was tailored to meet our requests accommodated all of our needs at a very reasonable price and went the extra mile with out any trouble to collect us for the hotel, drop us off and made further arrangements through out our stay in Vietnam on our behalf booking accommodation and arranging other tours. Alan also drove across Hanoi in the early morning prior to our departure to ensure that we had copies of photos and Go Pro camera coverage of our trip.Excellent service, excellent guide, excellent adventure highly recommended.

Given the chaotic traffic in Hanoi a proper helmet, fortunately never needed yet, is always a good idea.

Our motorcycle tour guide did a great job in taking care of us on the road. He was very knowledgeable and a lot of fun.

The whole tour, starting from the taxi pick up at Han Hoi airport to the taxi drop off at the end of the tour was organised impecably with great attention to detail, well done Alan very impressive! Our guide ( Coung) was very knowledgable, very friendly and spoke excellent English, he also did an excellent and very professional job and looked after us extremly well. The country was great with a surprise around every corner (almost). The variety of the roads and surfaces we rode on was such that you never had the opportunity to get bored. The accomodation ranged from acceptable to reasonably high standard but on the odd occasion where we didn't have aircon it was a struggle to sleep with the high temperature and humidity. We found all the the food we had on the tour was very good and the beer prices very acceptable, 15 pence for a glass of draft beer in one place we ate. We intend to come back to Vietnam in a couple of years time to do the North West but will try and arrange this earlier in the year when the temperature is better. The bikes we had were okay (XR125) but I would have like something with a little more power particularly on the twisty sections of the mountain roads, however they were light , manouverable and did the job. Riding in the towns and cities is not for the faint hearted but having said that I wouldn't hesitate recommending this tour for the experienced rider."

We started cycling from Hanoi then changed in Lao Cai - offroad Indonesia also known as off road Vietnam tours run by Mr Alan Chien is a professional well organised company that we cant rate highly enough. We asked for and were given an english speaking guide. For the cycle we also had a support van and driver - driver spoke no English but did understand us and we had a lot of laughs. Our guide Guan was excellent, our bikes were checked and refueled every night, Nothing was a problem, we did a variety of off road and sealed roads.Scenery and passes were just spectacular, You don't need a lot of clothes, It was warm but we did wear jackets for safety and light trousers. They supply full face helmets and gloves.The bikes 125 trail , mine had 6000 kms on and my partners had 21kms on so basically brand new. easy to ride and despite normally riding a 1000cc bike my partner found it excellent. The roads you are on these are just perfect. Our accommodation and food was all pre paid and arranged via Alan's company. I found the company on line when what was on offer at travel agents didn't meet our requirements. This company will arrange trekking, cycling and motorcycling and you can do a few days of each if you wanted.It was so easy to do. I did wonder if the company was real when I was emailing from NZ. Alan always emailed me back so quickly often within minutes.We paid a small deposit and the rest was paid on arrival. Alan arranged our visa's picked us up from airport and dropped us off. He took us for a meal on our return to Hanoi and was just an excellent host, organised and runs a good company. Guan the guide talked very well of Alan saying what a good employer he was. Vietnam has a lot of tour guides that work free lance for the tour company's. Alan employs them to fit the tours people want.I would not go past this company - we have friends who are looking at going early next year and they are going to go with Alan. Highly recommend if you want an exciting trouble free trip where you get to speak with the locals, live with them and photograph the amazing views.I am vegetarian and they catered for me at every stop. Nothing was a problem.We met some lovely people.Thankyou Alan for making our trip so good - If you think a tailor made tour is expensive it is not. We were surprised - our tour included all food, and accommodation which was mainly hotels but did have a couple of homestays which were lovely - really got to experience Vietnam. Also included 2 boat trips. All transfers etc.and you get to go where you want to go and when you want to go.Thanks again Jan and Stu"

Northern Vietnam by motorbike. 16 days of adventure, starting with 2 days exploring and sightseeing in Hanoi City, followed by 10 days riding with one rest day followed by 2 days at Halong Bay.To set the scene, I am just past 50, female and it had been many years ago that I rode motorbikes. However after a couple of trail rides and an hour on a road bike, I decided to ride some 1800 km around Northern Vietnam. Our group included 3 couples, 2 Urals and 2 Honda 125cc. We were joined by 2 blokes from Auckland on 125cc. The tour staff were all fantastic with good English. The tour leaders were Kiwis - Britton Adventures. We had a van for gear and emergencies and 3 support bikes.The tour started and ended in Hanoi City. Getting out of the city was white knuckle stuff with 3 lanes of traffic travelling on the wrong side of the road. Thoughts turn to wondering if you may have made the wrong decision to ride - least favorite part. Once the motorway was behind us, it was great fun. Some long days on a variety of roads and tracks with just as much variety in the weather. Hot, steamy days, rain, torrential rain and thunder storms. Expecting the unexpected is a good way to ride. Hazards included rocks, animals - cattle, dogs, chooks, pigs, ducks, a snake and more, children, people, bikes cars, buses, trucks. I hated the buses and their Yabba dabba doo horns the most. They owned the road!! Good thing is the speed is conservative, making this safe and do-able.Our accommodation was a mix of hotel and home stay, giving us an authentic Vietnamese experience.The food was mostly OK. Loved the baguettes for lunch, fresh salad, cheese, salami, ham and garlic paste. Rice wine was an acquired taste. The people in the country were happy to see us and friendly. They live a sustainable lifestyle and work very hard. Our travels - Hanoi - Ba Be Lake - Dong Van - Ha Giang - Bac Ha - Sapa - (Sapa Rest Day) - Mu Cang Chai - Phu Yen - Moc Chau - Pu Luong - Hanoi City.To complete the ride, a good dose of confidence is required with a bit of competency added in.Photography opportunities are amazing. I used a good point and shoot when riding and a pro camera for walkabout.The sensory experience is complete with sights, sounds, smells and tastes to boot.If you can tick the boxes for an adventure like this, it is well worth it.We were very well looked after and kept safe in a country that would be difficult to navigate alone."

It could be: the breathtaking scenery of mountain ranges or limestone hills or terraced rice fields; the local Hmong Tay or Nung children waving as you ride past; the brilliant twisty mountain roads; the subsistence farmers; the village markets that sell every conceivable food; the sudden appearance of buffalos, dogs or chooks; helping each other get the bikes through as a landslide has taken the road away. Yes, riding in Vietnam is amazing.Hai, the director of We Ride Vietnam, runs a very professional operation. Nothing is too much trouble as he sources excellent local food, supplies quality home stay and motel accommodation and has a thorough knowledge of and passion for his country. With a tourism degree and over a decade of experience leading tours Hai is bound to make your Vietnam trip a memory that you will treasure.Our route took us from Hanoi to Lang Son then West for 8 days to Sapa before the overnight train back to Hanoi. We were definitely off the tourist track as we saw very few westerners for 4 or 5 days. The riding suits adventure riders with lots of twisty bitumen and some rocky/muddy trails thrown in. We had some days of heavy summer rain that limited our off road adventures. My next trip will be Autumn/Spring. The Honda XR150s did a great job and are very suitable for the local conditions. In Australia we are used to bigger bikes but the 150s do well in the twisty/ rocky terrain and never missed a beat. Plus they have a comfortable seat - a big deal after 7 or 8 hours.We saw a couple of other tours during our trip and Hai\u2019s quality set up made them look decidedly dodgy. From excellent advice on what to pack, quality riding gear including jackets with armour and BMW pants, water-proof panier bags, to life saving tips on local traffic conditions, Hai from We Ride Vietnam provides an excellent guided bike adventure you will remember fondly for a very long time."

I only wish I had had the time to travel farther outside the city and surrounding area. But if your time is limited, Hai will show you a wonderful time. Visited major tourist attractions, including Ba VI National Park, featuring the tallest mountain in the region with an awesome view of Hanoi; traversed rice paddies, canals, backroads, and even visited a thousand-year old city and took in a glimpse of the past! Hai keeps things balanced (adapting to the riders' desired pace), with stretches of fun riding, but also plenty of stops for picture-taking opportunities, Vietnamese coffee breaks, and good local cuisine. I highly recommend We Ride Vietnam and will definitely be back for a longer ride, with more challenging terrain and rural/off-road trails. The most challenging part (from a riding perspective) of this ride was navigating the traffic as we left the city and returned to it at the end of the day - but the rest of the ride was easy-going and relaxing. For a day-trip/ride, it was well worth the price!!! Thanks Hai for a wonderful day, and for meeting me for coffee the night before the ride to chat a bit about the upcoming tour. Hope to ride with you again soon!"

He also loves a laugh and a joke. The scenery he showed us was a constant source of amazement.. be prepared for scenery overload. Theres a surprise around every corner, often the scenery, but sometimes the buffalo, chickens, dogs, goats, landslides, crazy bus or a scooter loaded to the eyeballs. The northeast ride was excellent, hardly saw another westerner for 4 days and the offroad sections were nice. We loved the local food, but did get 'the bug' for a few days _ maybe we brought it from home.. maybe not. If you come now (august) be prepared to get very hot or very wet. Or both like we did.. This ride suits adventure riders of average experience up or Hai can tailor to suit. Lots of sweeping corners that can turn into a rocky pothole, we could have done more offroad but the weather was not always kind. The little XR150'S handled the job admirably, i thought they would be too small but for the tight roads and rocky offroad were perfect. Any bigger and riders would just dig up the local tracks. Hai looks after the bikes well and they are well thought out with the 2 leather panniers more than enough room. Unless your like me and took too much- really only need a few pairs or socks undies tshirts and shorts. Once here we hardly spent anything except for beer and souvenirs, Hai covers all other food, soft drinks and water. We enjoyed the homestays and the food was really good. Some of the beds are a little hard.. i usually sneaked another nattress from somewhere... We would thoroughly recommend this tour to anyone looking to experience this amazing countries food, culture and awesome scenery."

He took the worry of organising anything out of us, which gave us all the time to simply enjoy the ride, the air, the people, the Country. He was also patient and gave us all the time we needed to stop and take photos whenever we felt like.I still dream to eat those super tasty spring rolls that a local woman made for us for dinner, when we stayed at an home-stay. Being able to spend an evening as guests of local people in a village in countryside Vietnam was a unique experience. Everything about that holiday was so unique.I would not hesitate one second to recommend Hai as a motorbike guide through anywhere in Vietnam.Davide"

Phung Van Hai, you are great at what you do and a fantastic ambassador for everything Vietnam has to offer.Hai puts together great itineraries, the bonus that the tour is all inclusive takes financial travel expense stress out of the equation & now that he is stocking his fleet with the Honda XR150 bikes, the stress of breakdowns is minimal with the added bonus that with bikes under 200cc, for a traveler from Australia, Travel Insurance will have you covered without additional premiums.!!!!Anyone who thinks that turning up to this country and buying a bike to travel independently is going to be easy is kidding themselves. Having the experience of a guide is the most essential part of getting the most out of this type of adventure.In the 12 days we were on tour we travelled to such remote places that without Hai's knowledge (and language) we never would have attempted, he made these experiences so stress free that we could just feel immersed in the local culture to experience it for what it was.As well as his professionalism and knowledge of the history of his country, Hai also carries a charming, witty personality with him that you can't help but enjoy.

I've always dreamed of riding the area around North Vietnam and I wasn't let down, mostly as Hai was a first class guide from start to finish & the route he chose from Ha Noi looping round across the mountains, through Pu Luong Nature Reserve & back up the Ho Chi Minh was both spectacular & challenging.The views we're absolutely breath-taking & the roads were generally clear of traffic as we took the lesser travelled path pretty much the whole way. When we did get stuck behind a bus or lorry something the bikes had more than enough to get round them quickly & we didn\u2019t run into a single technical problem the whole way (you can tell they really look after their bikes, was a joy to ride!) I know it's a clich\u00e9 but we really did go off the beaten path and through the dirt roads, farming villages & small towns off the main roads (I don't want to use the term the 'real' Vietnam as it's all real but this was definitely the non-tourist route!) We genuinely had people flock to see us when we'd stop off for food & I got so caught up in waving back to people on the way through anywhere inhabited I nearly came off a couple of times (there are WAY too many animals with no traffic sense out that way lol) The most difficult part of the ride was focusing on the road as the views were always so spectacular but Hai was always happy to stop anytime so I could just take it all in / rest / answer natures call.The homestays on route were both incredible, the hosts always fantastically hospitable, the food always delicious & plentiful and the beers plentiful and cold! Even got to try some grasshopper & I'm defiantly a fan! I really can't recommend these guys & specifically Hai as a guide enough, I'm already planning my next trip over for a much longer ride and I already know who I'm going to book with! :) Thanks guys!!"

Hai's knowledge of the land and culture was as good as it could get. We ate amazing food, rode down beautiful paths, and saw some mind-blowing scenery. We stayed in a mix of hotels and home stays, which were my favorite. The local families often treated us like their own and invited us to join them for evening meal. Hai knew people everywhere we went, and it felt good being treated with such kindness.The people of Vietnam are incredible. Humble and curious. I loved interacting with them.

It was my boyfriends second adventure with Hai and my first and it was absolutely amazing. After hearing about my boyfriends previous motorbike tour with Hai a couple of years earlier, l went out and got my motorbike licence and a bike just so l could experience travelling through Vietnam on a motorbike and l am so glad l did. We booked a 5 night/6 day tour from Hanoi to Sapa via Mai Chau with Hai and from the minute l took off on the bike heading out of Hanoi, l was in heaven. It was just the 3 of us, Hai, Jens and l and it was perfect. The scenery, the roads, the sights, the smells, the beautiful and friendly vietnamese people and the feeling of knowing we wouldn't have been privileged to see these parts of Vietnam if it wasn't for Hai's knowledge and expertise. We went on roads that no car or bus could go on and l don't know how many times a day l was taken back by the breathtaking views. We stayed in 2 homestay's, 1 at Mai Chau where we experienced beautiful home cooked vietnamese and l even tried fried grasshoppers for the very first time but l cant recall the name of the second homestay village. We worked our way up to Sa Pa over the next few days and rode through villages where we were constantly greeted by smiling and happy vietnamese people, it was these moments that l will never forget. These people have pretty much nothing, yet they are happy, their smiles light up their face and make you feel privileged to be visiting their part of the world. Travelling through Vietnam with Hai has been one of the most memorable adventures l have had, Jens, Hai and l have continued our friendship and we will be planning another trip with Hai at a later date. Hai is proud of his culture and loves showing you the hidden gems of Vietnam, we wouldn't have had the amazing experience we did if we didn't experience it on two wheels. If you are looking for the best way to explore Vietnam, give Hai a call at 'We ride Vietnam'. Hai can cater for all skill levels and his experience and knowledge makes you understand why he is the best person to ride you through Vietnam."

The region, punctuated by it's incredible relief, tribal cultures and vast Hmong historical centers, had only recently been opened up to tourist. I had been there a few years before on a government trip, but it was in the Winter, by car and I had a minder the entire time. This time it was just the two of us and our excellent guide Hai (Phung Van Hai). He took us everywhere! We asked for \"off-the-beaten-path\" & back-roads that is exactly what we got. We also requested to keep timing in mind b/c one of the things you do not want to mis out on when you are up there are the markets, they are based on the Lunar calendar, so it can be very difficult to line up locations. He was excellent at this. Finally, don't miss a stay at the French oasis in H\u00e0 Giang, Pan Hou Village, right in the heart of The Dao (pronounced Zao) people.

Vietnamese people are interesting, kind and thoughtful. Hai's enthusiasm and good humour are highly infectious and made the trip even more memorable!"

Seeing this country by motorbike took me to places every day where it feels like a tourist has never been, it challenged me so much mentally and physically (and inspired a lot of cool cred amongst the friends back home).Hai is such a funny tour guide and is so knowledgable, and Long (a.k.a the Vietnamese Mark Wahlberg) our mechanic saved the day so many times, they were a pleasure to ride with and the would always have your back. We were a group of 4 girls in our twenties - so don't let age, gender or experience stop you. We always felt safe (okay so the roads were a bit dodgy but everything else was sweet as) This really feels like one of those great, hidden adventures that not many people will get to experience. So much better than hours on a bus - we passed a few of those and they looked green with envy... or it could have been the hours on those roads. It was pretty challenging so I'd advise offroad and onroad experience before you go; that said none of the 4 of us had our licenses, and 1 of us we banned from driving as she's the WORST, so Long pillioned her the whole journey. If you're thinking about it and wavering, just do it. You'll never regret the experience."

Hai is very knowledgeable, knows the areas intimately, is adaptable to changing needs and wants and is a lot of laughs as well. Riding through one of the worlds most beautiful countries and interacting with its culture is a life changing experience that everyone should do at least once, twice, thr...This time around I went with my girlfriend who only learned to ride a motorbike to do this very trip. Hai is able to cater to all skills and preferences and you don't have to be the worlds best rider, or have years of experience to do Vietnam by motorbike. This is the best way to feel and understand this beautiful country as you're able to immerse yourself in it's culture and scenery. The sights, sounds, smells and beautiful smiles from people as you ride through the small villages is heartwarming and inviting. I love this place and the way that Hai, our guide, presents it. He knows many off the beaten track areas and can show you the 'real' Vietnam where you may well be the only Westerner in the entire town.We did the north-west tour, from Hanoi up to Sa Pa via Mai Chau for a home-stay and Nghia Lo and another stay with a name that escapes me right now. We saw waterfalls, crossed a beautiful lake with the motorbikes on a ferry, saw endless mountain ranges and experienced some of the best scenery Vietnam has to offer. We returned via train to Hanoi and rewarded our efforts with a lovely dinner with Hai and some of his family.If you ever wanted to do something special with your life, do a tour of Vietnam with Hai as your guide!Thank you Hai."

The countryside was spectacular and very much only accessible by bike and in the true hinterland of North West Vietnam. We were always confident in our wonderful and well infomred guide and secure with the technical back up when needed. The days were well planned and although we spent about 70% offroad we were always on time and never fetl we were missing any sights. The tour was a Hanoi rouind trip ending by an overnight train to Hanoi. We rated every minute of the tour very highly and would recommend any of the tours without any reservation.

Hai was really well organised and can fix anything to do with a bike on the side of the road. Every morning he took us for coffee and Pho, gave us wonderful baguettes, cheese and pates for lunch and amazing local restaurants for dinner where I thought I had never eaten food so good. At night we stayed in comfortable hotels but the best was the home stay where we got to spend time with some lovely locals and they enjoyed giving us their local firewater to drink. Everyday was an adventure, you never knew what was going to be round the corner and I spent a lot of time laughing and falling off in the mud ( much to the amusement of the locals).

Eight of us, all very seasoned motorcyclists, rode with Hai and his mechanic from Hanoi north and and then west to Lao Cai. The roads and trails were varied running through small villages and a couple of larger towns encompassing the expected lowland rice paddies but also limestone karsts and many high terraced mountains. Absolutely stunningly beautiful scenery. The sort of vistas where you stop and say to yourself \"I can't believe I'm here.\" There are a number of go pro videos we took that are posted on you tube under the title Border Crawl 2013.

Apart from the whole experience being so good, having someone like Hai and his crew deal with accident situations in a foreign country was just ABSOLUTELY GREAT!

The 3 staff were just incredible and contributed immensely to the fun we had whilst still keeping everyone safe and organised- no mean feat considering the characters in our group! We took a 10 day north east tour up to the Chinese border and saw some of the most spectacular scenery imaginable. We had the opportunity to interact with local villagers along the way who were curious but always friendly. We experienced parts of Vietnam only visited by western tourists in recent years and so felt that it was a taste of the true untouched Vietnam. Finishing off with an additional 2 nights cruising on Ha Long Bay which (also arranged for us) was a great idea as it allowed for a relaxing unwind before we returned home.The tour organiser/leader, Hai, was very organised, spoke English well and easily understood us and our Aussie sense of humour, joining in our hijinks and frivolity at every opportunity. His preparation, attention to detail and arranging everything to suit us all on the tour was exceptional. His support staff were also loads of fun to have along with us. Our support car driver (Jhoey?) was so much fun and extremely respectful of us whilst being attentive to our every need. He was very knowledgeable and informative about local people and customs which made the trip for the non-riders an amazing experience as well. The mechanic (Huwei?) whilst being quieter and more reserved still joined in the fun and was ever at the ready to assist with the bikes and responsibly helped guide the riders along the way. The accommodations were very satisfactory especially considering we visited some very \"out of the way\" places. The \"homestays\" were also a fun option to experience. The food throughout was traditional, excellent and plentiful. (Our gluten intolerant member of the group was well catered for also). If you are an adventurer who loves motorcycle riding and getting off the beaten track then this is for you. You will be in great hands with \"We Ride Vietnam!\""

Thu Do was our wonderful guide who introduced us to the hidden marvels of street food and made us feel more confident about 'grazing' around Hanoi in future. Particularly memorable were banh mi with egg and herbs, egg coffee, green mango salad with seafood and Vietnamese pancake. Thu sent us a follow up email with details of places visited, details of food with information about each item. A real treasure. Thanks Thu for a great evening."

We were on our first trip to Hanoi, Vietnam and decided to follow our habit and join a street food tour with Viet Mind Tours. They keep a group small, up to 6 people which is a good thing as we did not spend much time waiting for other members of our group to finish their meal and could always grab a table in places we went to. It's a walking tour so expect to walk 3-4km on foot but I did not feel the distance. The tour was 3 or 3.5hrs and we visited 8 places which is a lot food so you won't be left hungry. I quite liked the selection and itinerary as we started with snacks - steamed rice rolls and deep fried spring rolls, etc. Then we moved to mains - B\u00e1nh m\u00ec, dry chicken noodle, B\u00fan ch\u1ea3, and finished off with a coffee and a beer. The places are truly local, you won't see them from the street and you have to know that the place is there to at least walk in.

Trung ngai cuu (Tarragon and eeg fried) : Hang Dau street2. Pho tron ( Dry mixed noodle) : Hang Chi3.Thit nuong ( BBQ pork ) : Hang Dieu4.Banh xeo ( Vietnamese pancake,wrapped with rice paper) :Hang Dieu5. Bun bo Hue ( Hue noodle) : 60 Bat Su6. Nuoc mia ( sugar cane juice) :Hang DieuSome of the eateries were down alleyways and small hole in the walls that as a tourist, you'd never find on your own. She can customize the tour to dietary restrictions and allergies as well. One minor warning to people with knee problems, many of the local places require you to sit outside on a small stool. Again can be managed around, but good to be aware of.The tour also takes you all over the Old Quarter of the city with its unique architecture, crazy traffic, and vibrant street life and performers.Truly outstanding way to experience Hanoi through its food and nightlife!"

This tour was specially arranged as our hotel manager knew we had also booked the street food tour for the same evening. The motorbike tour was fantastic, it was great to see the local villages and explore narrow back streets by motorbike; wonderful way to experience everyday life in Hanoi. Our guides were great - the guys were very knowledgeable about the history of Hanoi, local customs and answered all our questions on what it was like to live in Hanoi. In the evening we did a street food tour with our guide, Mr Sing. We had a fantastic experience and loved all the vietnamese street food. Mr Sing took us to some amazing little and unknown street food vendors along the way."

Listen to everyone else and book it on day one!Bob was already at our lobby when we came downstairs - he was such a great guide. His English was perfect and he was so knowledgable. It especially excited us that he spoke slang. It made our conversations so relatable and natural. We met up with two more groups and were on our merry way. The tour ended being 4 hours long: we tried some of the best food we had during our 5 day trip there. He took us to all his favourite places and not a single one disappointed. He made sure that they were spaced apart so that we also got to know the city as well. It started to rain so we got us all ponchos. When we were finished, we asked for a hostel recommendation and he walked with us for another 15 minutes to ensure we went to the right one. The hostel was also a perfect fit for us. It was both our favourite experience - would def recommended! Well worth the $25 USD/person. Bob is the best!"

This was a great way to see Hanoi especially if it is your first day as you will get to experience the foods which you might not know about it. We particularly loved the Bun Cha place he took us to and also the Banh Cuon which was something we might not have tried. Duy was such a friendly and welcoming guide and was very knowledgeable about Hanoi and Vietnam food in general. We appreciated that genuine personal touch he gave towards us which is something that may be difficult to find in Hanoi!Would definitely recommend them and make sure you go with an empty stomach as you will eat so much food!"

I booked a lunchtime food tour with Viet Mind Tours and must say it turned out to be one of the best food and cultural experiences I have had in a long time.We explored 8 different traditional Vietnamese restaurants sampling the huge variety of wonderful treats on offer covering Hanoi's greatest hits.Each course was at a different restaurant, some on the street, some inside, but all hugely popular with locals and fun to be part of. In every case we could see our food being prepared and gained insights into the ingredients and techniques involved.As it was a walking tour, a bonus is that we got to explore the Old Quarter of Hanoi, a chaotic jumble of historic streets and locations. Bob, our excellent (and fluent in English) host was not only great about talking about food but was full of fascinating insights into Vietnam and Hanoi's insight and culture.In summary, if you want an introduction into the real food of Hanoi then this is the tour for you. It was impeccably organised, the variety excellent, paced perfectly and the food was stellar!!! I can't finish without once again mentioning Bob (his English pseudonym) as he was one of the best hosts I've ever had the pleasure of touring with. For example,he noticed I particularly enjoyed one of the dishes we ate and subsequently, without me asking e-mailed a comprehensive recipe. That is customer service at its best."

He gave us information on not just the food but the history of the city, current events, cultural information. He made the tour about more than just the food (which was incredible on it's own). We were here to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and did some great things, but this food tour was hands down the best thing about our trip. We would do it again each time we return to Hanoi."

I was expecting a 2.5 - 3.0 hour tour that would be somewhat formulaic. Not true. 4 hours later he was as energetic as ever wanting to show me all the best spots in Hanoi. Ha was an encyclopedia of knowledge about the city and its landmarks. Yes the food was great but it was so much more. He took me all around the city to places I would have never been able to go - from the huge Jack fruit tree in the compounds of a Buddhist temple to the temple complex on the banks of West lake to the John McCain memorial to all the food markets on the banks of the Homg River, Ha took me everywhere. I would highly recommend his tour. He will work to adapt it to the size of your group and your interests."

From curbside stools to air-conditioned eatery. Ha is a great guide, genuine, speaks excellent English and passionate about his job. I learnt abt him and this tour through Chef Hing when I took the cooking Class at Orchid Restaurant in the morning and I am glad I did this. Will definitely recommend my friends to Ha and this tour."

It was an amazing experience!They promptly picked us up at our hotel at 5pm. For the next 4hrs we whisked through the crowded streets of Hanoi like locals. Ha expertly guided us by some of the most interesting sights in the city. Along the way he enchanted us with his insight and expert information. We saw things and had experiences that probably few travelers do.As we sit here at our hotel bar, my wife is beaming with excitement, stating that this was the best night of our lives....and I whole heartedly agree!Ha's motor scooter tour is not to be missed!!Thanks Ha, Bob, and the whole Viet Mind team."

We were a challenge because I'm a vegetarian and my fiance can't stand seafood so Thanh customized a special itinerary for us to enjoy some interesting and tasty Vietnamese cuisine. He was also very accommodating and changed our plans accordingly (we skipped a step because we thought it was too much). He speaks English very well, he was able to answer all of our questions and even gave us information about Hanoi.

Our guide was friendly, knowledgeable about food and was able to navigate our small group (4 people) in and out of the traffic through small streets around old Hanoi. We ate in different types of restaurants from those with teak tables and chairs to plastic stools and ate an extensive menu with fish, pork, chicken, egg, vegetable dishes and fruit, coffee and beer at the end - not to mention a variety of noodles, rice paper wraps and crackers and different types of rice. The price did not break the bank and the experience was definitely worth it. I would thoroughly recommend this tour to those who like eating food and seeing a different side of Hanoi."

They took me on the back of their scooter and showed us the old bridge, had a beer along the river, went back into town to see the mausoleum, park, tasted the best spring roll we had in Hanoi and had an egg coffee.The best part of it all was different just getting a feel for the city from the bike. We smelled the fruit market (that only opens at midnight because trucks can't travel during the day), saw young couples doing their thing along the bridge, people exercising in the park at night. We got to talk about what Vietnamese life was like and what the local experience is.Definitely wish we spent a bit more time as Vietnam is meant to be done by bike."

But being our first day in Hanoi / Vietnam, it was very overwhelming - what do we try first?! So after walking around for a bit, we decided to book a private tour to help give us a good head start on what to order! And so glad we did - Our guide was Duy and he was so friendly. Before we started he talked to us about what we were after and tailored the tour around what our ideal menu options would (or in our case, would not) be. We are adventurous with eating, but a few things were off the menu for us. Once we established that, we set off. We ate some amazing things that we wouldn't have known to order if we were on our own - and even got to try making our own rice paper. Duy kept adapting the tour to what our tastes were / how full we were getting. It was also great to go through little back alleys and get a local view of Hanoi. The best part was that over the few hours of the tour we also had all our questions answered with regard to Vietnamese culture and history! Once we had completed the tour, we felt like we had left with a friend, rather than a guide.

Delicious food all round, we tasted plenty of variety and really got a feel for the way the locals eat. Everything including dessert is covered and we got a great feel for the city at the same time. Would recommend doing this on your first night to get a feel of things. Big thanks to Jay for his expertise - would definitely recommend! Only wish I had a second stomach.."

We were intrigued by all of the locals eating at the little tables and plastic stools, but we did not know which street foods to try, so we thought we would try a street food tour. Our guide Mark Nguyen was great! Mark is friendly, polite, energetic, knowledgeable, professional and has great English. Over three hours we tried eight different street foods and tried things that we never would have tried on our own and went to different spots that we never would have found on our own. A highlight of our time in Vietnam! Highly recommended! It was a lot of fun and Mark is good company as well as being a good guide."

He arrived promptly and we started eating straight away with a delicious egg dish cooked on the corner of the street I was staying in. The knowledge that Mr Ha imparts not only about the food but also the history of the area was excellent. The variety of food I was able to try along with just being in the wonderful atmosphere of the those eating on the street was a great way to start my first trip to Vietnam. This is a must-do tour and I'm sure you will love every single stop. Make sure you try an egg coffee or hot chocolate it's simply outstanding. Thanks Mr Ha you were a wonderful guide."

I arranged for a one on one tour through my hotel and was totally happy!! \"Ha\" showed up at 8am we had a brief discussion of what I wanted to see and eat and learn about, then we were on the moto and off to Ha's favorite eel restaurant. The soup was amazing, the eel sausage was even better and we sampled a few pork sausages steamed in banana leaves and dipped in a fresh made chili sauce...AWESOME!!! From there it was onto the dry beef noodle shop, then onto roast pork belly with sticky rice ,bun cha, sweet black sticky rice and on and on. In all we sampled 18 different things as well as going to 2 different markets and a relaxing cruise around the lake on the way home.I,ve done lots of cooking classes throughout asia that have a mini market tour built in, but this was hands down the best. With my background in food, Ha was engaging and was interested to learn what I would do with certain items....it was a great day, and a great way to learn about Hanoi and the super nice people living there. I would highly recommend this tour company"

We had come from Thailand and taken a few food tours there, however we were simply surprised by how much better this one was. The true highlight was our guide Nhung/Rose! She was extremely friendly, funny, knowledgeable, and entertaining throughout the entire evening. Everyone in our group of 6 had a great time and a lot of that was thanks to Nhung. She is truly unique in all of the best ways and we are so thankful that we got her as our guide for the evening.In terms of the food, it was delicious. It's hard to remember everything we had, but it included fish spring rolls, an egg dish, bahn mi, a sugarcane treat, BBQ pork broth, vietnamese egg coffee, and a few more I can't remember. It was a good mix of food to introduce you to Vietnamese cuisine, and it was all really tasty too! The tour was also spaced out appropriately so that you never felt too full or heavy like you can on other food tours.Overall it was simply one of the best food tours we have had the privilege of going on."

We paid a fee for it but it was amazing experience. They speak English very well, they gave to us a VERY VERY new bike and we have NO problem with it. We dropped off it one day before in hanoi, and they returned to us a 3% of the reservation and the deposit money on the go. They was very kindly and very professional.We rented it from Spain (by mail) and made a pay (a percentage of reservation) via onepay.vn without problems.For our experience, we recommend flamingo travel and this route (Saigon to Hanoi)."

Had saddle bags and everything we needed for the trip. They even put the bike on the train for us. (approx 40$US for bike transport ticket) Something I recommend if you want to get in the North faster. They can also arrange train tickets for travellers. Service was great before and during our tour. It is truly the best way to explore Vietnam if you feel comfortable riding there. No problems with the bike but they do offer 24H help line. We enjoyed it so much that we are coming back next March to ride on the HCM trail and will be doing business with Flamingo again. Thanks for the opportunity!"

The hosts at the homestay were very friendly and provided plenty of food although they don't speak english haha but we found ways to communicate. the accom is basic but clean and all part of the experience. the GPS was essy enough to follow although having met the team at flamingo i recon doing a guided trip would be fun cos the guys are so helpful and friendly but having said that we had no issues at all on our trip other than a flat GPS battery but we just stopped at a little village and we're able to buy some AAs for a few dollars. the scenery and countryside we rode through is world's apart from the city of Hanoi and it is well worth your time and money to get out there and enjoy it on a flamingo tour"

He's great with people and has a genuine interest in making the trip memorable. All of our bikes were in good working order and were appropriate for the job. Our hotels were of varying quality, but that was all part of the adventure. The Home stays were always excellent (and our preference over hotels). If you're going to do this trip, go for the XR 250's, they are worth the extra coin, and request Hue as your guide. You will have a ball!"

It was fantastic, we travelled from HCMC - Bao Loc - Dalat - Nha Trang - Mui Ne - Vung Tao - HCMC. A total of nearly 1200 Km in 4.5 days. Ms Tram Pham was very helpful in the process. She advised how many Km's to do each day and also recommended places to stay on the trip. Their mechanic also provided us with key spares for the bikes which was excellent. We actually didn't need anything other than one inner tube due to a nail in a tyre. The bikes ran beautifully and my brother who was visiting VN for the first time had an absolute blast. The best part for me was over the mountain pass from Dalat into Nha Trang however the coast road when approaching Mui Ne was also fabulous."

Nothing was too much and he was very knowledgeable about the Mekong. We spent 7 days buzzing about the Mekong Delta with many adventures. Mostly completely off the tourist trails. The bikes were old and small (125's but not scooters) but well maintained and the guide paid for everything. Ferries, drinks, accommodation, petrol meals etc. All in all I found Flamingo well organised, easy to deal with and excellent value. Just a note: small bikes or at least narrow bikes are a good idea in the Mekong. Don't even think about running a big BMW or something like it. Take local advice on everything. Just a wonderful trip overall. Thanks Flamingo and KC(King Cong) the excellent guide."

As we were hungry they stopped to collect some breakfast on the way.Throughout the trip our leader, Hua, provided great information on the things we saw and the people we met and at each hotel, carried our bags and ensured we were settled. As we wanted to spend a couple of days back in Sapa at the end of our ride they moved our bags to our new hotel in the morning, dropped is in Lao Cai (the finish point) in the afternoon and saw us onto a bus.Tram, the booking agent, even moved our overnight train to Hanoi to the end of our stay and offered to book us into a hotel in Sapa for the extra nights.When we did return to Hanoi we were, once again, allowed to shower in the hostel but the biggest help was when we found we'd left a tablet pc on the train.

We did not pre-book the bike as I like the chance to look at the bike before signing up to hire it. If I had just booked in advance our trip could have been a lot different. If I was able to organise the trip with the benefit of hindsight I would have no hesitation in hiring from Flamingo Travel. The reasons for this are many. We wanted a 250cc bike as we are European sized people carrying luggage so would need the extra power. Larger bikes are not routinely carried by the bike companies in HCMC so obtaining one was difficult in the short term when we arrived. Tram at Flamingo Travel worked tirelessly to obtain a bike for us which suited our needs and was able to get us a fine Honda XR250 for our trip. Throughout our search she kept us updated on progress. Tram also helped us obtain a Vietnamese mobile phone for use on our trip. 5 days into our trip my wifes' bag was stolen with our two passports in it. This meant that to stand any chance in obtaining the travel documents to leave the country as planned we had to return to HCMC. Tram at Flamingo travel helped us all along the way in dealing with the Police, giving advice over the phone and finally obtaining an express service for the exit visa we needed to leave the country. This is going to sound like an advert but is absolutely true without reservation. We were hired an excellent motorcycle which performed perfectly during the time we had it. The additional service we were blessed to receive went well beyond what anyone has a right to expect and reflects the very best of the Vietnamese people. Generous, friendly, hard working, resourceful and inspirational. Tram Pham and Flamingo Travel thank you from the bottom of our hearts."

He really made me feel like a valued customer.All in all a very good experience and a fantastic way to see this beautiful country. I will definitely be using Flamingo travel next time I'm in Vietnam"

I emailed multiple times during my planning stage and always received a prompt reply. I went on the North Central six day tour. Hue was my tour guide. He spoke great English and always explained things in detail the best he could. He knew all the hotel and restaurant owners and after a couple of days he knew exactly the type of food I preferred. It was nice arriving at a restaurant after riding multiple hours and not having to stress about the food and preparation. The bike was great. I took the KLX 150. Next time I'll ride the Honda 250cc. It's an overall larger bike. I'm 6'5\". The extra suspension would have been better. However, the 150cc had plenty of power. The tour pretty much covers everything I was looking for. Don't hesitate to reserve your tour of Vietnam with Flamingo Travel. Ask for \"Hue\"."

They are all very experienced bikers and 'adventurers' so their expectations are very high. Hung, the guide and manager of Flamingo, gave us a totally bespoke service, modifying the trip on a day by day basis to ensure the group got the absolute maximum from the tour. Suffice to say it was an incredible tour which would have been impossible without the faultless performance of the bikes (mainly Honda XR 250s) and Hung's local knowledge and fantastic service."

As we had rented motorbikes (200 and 250ccm) in Laos (3 times), Thailand (twice) and the Philippines previously, we can say that Flamingo was the best company overall. We had 125s this time, which are perfectly light and manoeuvrable in offroad sections. The lack of power on fast onroad tracks is inevitable. The maintenance of the bikes was the best ever, as virtually everything was working properly - including the speedmeter, which never worked on all previous bikes. We had to exchange one battery on the trip - the nice young lady at the HCM branch gave us the money back without any negotiation, even though we did not have a receipt. Perfect customer service."

Also I wanted the enjoyment of riding and not just the scenery so for me that meant the bike had to be bigger then 400cc. Settling for the DR650 was a blessing. Thankyou Flamingo travel for providing me with a top notch bike that performed perfectly for the 4500kms traveled in 19 days. Couldn't of done this on anything else. Will be getting another bike from Flamingo to tour North Vietnam in their warmer weather"

Since you can rent a bike almost everywhere in Hanoi, you don't really know where to go for good quality. Search no more, this is the place to go to! Cheaper is not always better if it comes to safety, and Flamingo Travel has different types of bikes for different prices. They explain everything in good english and show you how the bikes work. After you sign a contract they guide you to their workshop where proffesionals check the bikes before leaving. The bikes were in good condition and we didn't had to call the office once during our 5 days. The freedom you'll experience on a bike is what makes it all worth while, and I would recommend it to everyone!"

I have rented a Honda Future X 125cc (10 Hp) for a 21 days self-guided motorbiketrip through the north-west of Vietnam in from 15 november \u2013 5 december.I had done some research and decided that as a not very experienced biker this was a good bike for me. Not too much power and easy to handle and perfect for the mountain area.. After a brief conversation with the very friendly, professional and efficient girls in the office, they agreed on this. Everything about the rental procedure was explained very clearly and I even got some discount because of renting for 21 days.The bike was in a good condition (it was checked and maintained the day before my departure) and had a low mileage. The mechanics also tied a rack onto the back and gave some bungeeropes to tie my luggage bag to it. I was provided with a good and strong integral helmet with a visor (good protection for face, ears etc.). Also a list with hotels, guesthouses and homestays was included.The staff is 24h available on the phone to solve any problems such as mechanical problems, accidents, police controls etc. This gave me a good feeling.So off I went and had a great trip. On 2200 km. the bike was really reliable, no problems at all (just starting and running). The only thing I had to take care of was after each 800 km. to change the oil, oil the chain and check the brakes. This costs just 80.000 \u2013 90.000 VND each time and it was easy to find a repair shop (b.t.w.. I had this written on a paper by the staff in Vietnamese).Unlike other rental companies, Flamingotravel will not charge you for scratches etc and are extremely reasonable about bike conditions upon return. And my deposit was waiting for me when I returned.I was very satisfied with Flamingo: the staff, the motorbike and the other services). So if you want rent a motorbike in Hanoi: Flamingotravel is the place to go!!!!So a lots of thanks to the staff and mechanics of Flamingotravel, keep up the good works and hope to see you again.Freddy Koekoek, The Netherlands"

I bought a Yamaha YBR from them and rode it to Hanoi where the HQ office bought it back from me for a VERY fair price. In May 2014 I returned and bought a Yamaha Nuevo scooter that I rode until I left in July. Instead of selling it back to them, I gave it to a friend who still rides it. Now that I live in Dalat, VN and own bigger bikes, I do less business with Flamingo, though I still visit every time I'm in town. I also recommend them without hesitation to everyone I meet (and sometimes even someone just walking down the street). Earlier this week, I wrote a blog post with some information about buying a motorbike in Saigon and again wrote glowingly about Flamingo Travel. I'm a big fan.If you buy a motorbike somewhere else and later regret it because you ignored Flamingo's overwhelmingly positive reviews here and elsewhere, it was probably because you thought buying the cheapest would save you money.

We were even upgraded for free in the train (from Lao Cai to Hanoi)!They also have an office in Saigon, which is very helpful!Bravo to the management and the staff for this very very reliable business!Matthieu, resident in Vietnam for 2 years"

On 2.500 km the two bikes were really reliable. We only had minor problems like a blown fuse or light bulb on one of the bikes. None of these I would not have expected at home with my bike on this distance under same conditions. The bikes were in excellent technical condition. A 24h Helpline, a detailed briefing on our route and a big package of spareparts including oil gave us he necessary safety to make our trip. The cost for a damaged odometer that we have caused were handeled under very fair conditions after our return.No hidden cost for replacement of parts after return!

We will not charge you for the damages on the bike. When we returned the bikes they claim that we lost 1 peg and made us pay for it. How can a peg comes of the bracket is the bike is not dropped ? But no signs or scratches of dropping the bike were found on this side.The helmet that we got was unsafe as one of the straps came off the helmet, as it was totally rusted. I don't think what would happen if we got involved in an accident. I would go other places to rent and take pictures of the bike before you sign on anything as they will get you. Gas, they give you a total empty tank good maybe for 2-3 miles. You fill it up and give it back half to full as you would not like to go to empty. They sell the gas to next costumer."

We rented a Yamaha YBR 125 from the Ho Chi Minh Agency for 40 days to cross the country, go up to Sa Pa and come back to Hanoi. We did 4000km my gf behind and myself driving the back. What and adventure, one of the best things I've done in my life ! I really enjoyed driving the bike, especially in the mountains going up to Sa Pa. The lands there are absolutely amazing, beautiful green mountains endlessly dominate the landscape.We had a serious problem with the bike after 30 days of travelling (4-5h of driving every day more or less) and Hung helped us out a lot, he was always available on the phone to speak with the mechanic and try and solve the problem. He speaks good english. It costs us about 500,000 VND to fix the bike (it was an engine problem) and costs us a day of travelling, since we were stuck in a small town in the mechanics. We also had a small crash with another bike, and broke the plastic cover of the front tire. Since it was more or less the same price, Hung called it quits, so he is a fair man and you can trust him.I would 100% recommend this company, they are experts.THANK YOU FLAMINGO TRAVEL ! I will make a video of the trip, I filmed it in 60fps 1080p :)"

            "review": "Vietnam Adventure Motorcyclining. In September 2015 I did a 4 day adventure motor cycle trip in Vietnam with a friend and the owner of Flamingo Travel, Hung, and one of his Flamingo guides, Tan. We rented two Kawasaki KLX 250's from Flamingo Travel in Hanoi which turned out to be the perfect size bike for the terrain. At home I ride a KTM 1190R and found the smaller lighter bike on the more technical rides very forgiving. We rode from Hanoi to Mai Chau and spend around 8 hours per day for the next 3 days in the mountains and countryside around Mai Chau. Around 50% of the road were single tracks through spectacular lush green scenery, amazing waterfalls (where I cooled off) and quaint little villages. Tan kept the riding exciting by varying the tracks between rocky mountain, muddy, two track dirt, single track forest and concrete paths through rice paddies. He managed to find magnificent little \"restaurants\" for lunch every day where a delicious meal with 6 - 8 different dishes would set you back a couple of dollars. Our wifes and my 4 year old daughter spent the 4 days relaxing at the Eco Lodge in Mai Chau and we joined them in the evenings upon return for \"dinner and dancing\". Our ride was for those with some experience but the routes cater for all levels of riding for those comfortable on dirt tracks and Tan will quickly gauge the skill of the riders. Having traversed Africa and South America on motorbike I can honestly say that this experience ranks right up there with some of the most spectacular rides I've ever done. I can strongly recommend it. Just check the timing with Flamingo in Hanoi as it would be very challenging in the rainy season and extremely hot around mid year."

Upon leaving we received any spare parts that could possibly be needed during the trip. The bike was in good condition, handled well and sounded like a proper motorbike. We were expecting some rain during the weekend but as soon as we were outside of Hanoi we all got soaking wet up to our underwear. Trying to warm up and looking at the weather forecast we found out that from here on the weather would only get worse and Mai Chau may end up being more of a suicide mission than a nice trip. We decided on a day trip to Ba Vie instead. It was a very wet day but we nevertheless had a wonderful trip. The dirt roads lined with potholes filled with water added a certain dimension to our trip and where no problem for this bike. Upon returning the bike one day early Hung, the representative from Flamingo, offered us a full refund on the bike for the second day as he felt sorry for us as we had bad weather. I was very surprised by this but gladly accepted this offer. Flamingo is not the cheapest place to rent a motorbike in Hanoi but in my opinion well worth the investment. For the next trip I will definitely hire a bike from this company again."

Myself and 3 other friends from Scotland stumbled into flamingo travel, with the intention of buying a motorcycle in Hanoi to ride down to Hoh Chi Minh City.After a brief conversation with Chris, and English employee in the Hanoi office, he had managed to convince us to rent. Most people tell you that rental companies are out there to rip you off and to make as much money from inexperienced, naive tourists as possible and to an extent they are correct (personal experience has taught me this) but flamingo travel are different. If you are on a tight timeline like we were (21 days) they will rent you bikes in Hanoi and provide transport for them from Hoh Chi Minh to Hanoi upon arrival. We rented 3 Honda lifans (125cc) and a future - moped for 175 dollars each for 21 days. At first this seemed very expensive and with the thought of them requiring a passport that would be sent from Hanoi to Saigon made us very apprehensive but we made the decision to go ahead.In the evening, we went for some drinks with Chris and the owner who sat us down with a map and suggested the best routes and attractions to visit on our journey - making the experience a lot more personal and friendly. This was extremely helpful.The bikes were in good condition with very low mileage. We had several experienced bike mechanics with us that were able to point out any faults and the mechanics would fix before departure. The mechanics also tied racks onto the back so that we could tie our large luggage bags to them Aswell as providing large saddle bags (or they offered to transport your luggage to Saigon). Once we were happy with the bikes and both ourselves and flamingo had taken photos and documented each bikes condition we set off. Flamingo have a 24 hour mechanic on standby that can speak fluent English and Vietnamese and can translate problems to local mechanics which was very useful.Unlike other rental companies, flamingo will not charge you for scratches etc and are extremely reasonable about bike conditions upon return. Although buying a bike was our intention, renting from flamingo saved us a lot of time buying/selling (not as easy as you think - no matter what way you do the trip most people lose a lot of money) and also breakdown time as these bikes were extremely reliable.Upon arrival in Saigon, the bikes were checked by mechanics and our passport was returned with no damages incurred.All in all, it was a trip of a lifetime made all the more enjoyable by an excellent company.Thanks so much Flamingo travel.Mark, Hamish, Josh and Jonny."

We rented four 125cc Honda Future bikes at Flamingo Travel in order to travel around the northern part of Vietnam for 7 days. We had found deals elsewhere in Hanoi for Honda Waves for around 6 dollars/day, but at Flamingo we were convinced that a larger bike (larger wheels) is more suitable for the roads outside of the city due to potholes and such. I am glad we made this choice since the roads could at times be demanding indeed.In summary, Flamingo was not the cheapest deal we could've had, but I am glad we chose for them since we had no mechanical breakdown during the trip (with quite some mileage), which I attribute to proper prior maintenance of the bike by Flamingo. I also had confidence that any mechanical issues we would've encountered along the way would've been solved in an honest and fair way, though we did not put this to the test since we, as indicated, did not encounter any mechanical troubles. The Flamingo team was friendly and helpful in their dealings with us."

From Lao Cai we went north-east up into the mountains and followed the Chinese boarder to Ha Giang, Yen Minh, M\u00e9o Vac, Nguy\u00e9n Binh, and over to Ban Gioc Waterfalls.Here is a tip if you go to the falls in the dry season, go after 11o'clock cause that's when they turn on the water so the tourists can see them in their full glory, it's true. Our rout took us to some pretty remote villages where we had a break down with one of the bikes. It took awhile to find the problem (Loose wire plus new battery). We called Flamingo's hot line and they approved the repairs and we were on our way. We were reimbursed for the cost with no questions asked back in Hanoi. Even though we were a little off the main tourist routs Flamingo gave us a list of hotels in the villages where we were going to stay.

Finally they matched the price and I agreed to go through them. When I got my passport back the extension stamp stated the actual price of the stamp which was ten dollars.

We had dealt with a lot of businesses in Vietnam and this was definitily one of the best ones. People which are buying chinese copy bikes for the cost of 10% of what a a similar bike in the western world would cost should accept and understand the limitations of quality. You get what you pay for. There are always some issues with these bikes, there is a good reason why you find mechanics everywhere in this country. If you go with a good company like Flammingotravel you can reduce your risk for problems with these bikes but generally dealing with some issues is part of the adventure in this country!"

            "review": "Expensive and malfunctioning. I never normally post reviews on tripadvisor, but I felt compelled to after the experience that my friend and I had with Flamingo. We bought two motorbikes from their office in Hanoi to drive down to Ho Chi Minh. We bought two Honda Wins for $410 USD each, primarily on the basis of the sales pitch from Flamingo (they employer westerners to stand out front and entice the tourists) that their bikes are better even if they do cost a little bit more. Our thinking was that we were willing to pay just a little bit more to ensure that we are able to get down to Ho Chi Minh on mechanically sound bikes. Being relatively new to third world bikes (we both drive bikes in Australia), we didn't spot many of the problems with the bikes when we inspected them and each time we came upon an issue, they played around with the bikes and found a quick solution. Reluctantly, we ended up taking the bikes, perhaps they saw a rabbit in the headlights as they was little scope of haggling with them. We started our drive to Halong Bay and we didn't even get outside of Hanoi before the bikes started failing. By of that day, it became apparent that the gearbox and the clutch on one of the bikes was so bad, that unless you kept it in 3rd gear or higher it would stall. This proved to be extremely dangerous on a number of occasions. On the same day, the key to one of the motorbikes flew out of the ignition whilst it was driving stranding us in the middle of nowhere. Long story short, we got in contact with a friend who is a local and he readily informed us that we had bought duds. Both bikes required extremely expensive engine rebuilds to make it down the country. By the end of our trip after talking to many locals and other tourists, it was apparent that we had paid well over the market rate for our bikes.While I should say that during their sales pitches, they are very friendly and appear to offer lots of help with things like routes, maps and wet weather gear. When we went to pick these things up, they were very reluctant to give them up.I would advise anyone considering buying bikes to do this trip look buy from anyone but Flamingo."

The bike seemed to be small for the purpose but it was a tough 125cc that managed quite well with both of us and our stuff on the challenging roads of the mountain villages. We only had a small technical problem that they helped us sort out at a local xe mai. They gave us the money back straight away when we returned the bike.Definitely would recommend to others and would use again if we come back to Vietnam."

My Dad and I booked a 6 day guided Northwest Vietnam motorbike trip from Hanoi to Sapa, we were joined by two others so had a group of four. In the lead up to the trip, Ms Thuy in the office was really helpful and very responsive to emails which was much appreciated.Pinky, our guide, was outstanding and really made the trip. I didn't have a lot of experience riding a motorbike but Pinky always made sure I was comfortable with the traffic and the speed, as he did for everyone in our group. He managed the trip so well by letting more experienced riders go ahead if there was a difficult bit of terrain, and I was really impressed by the way he managed to make sure that everyone was getting what they wanted to out of the trip. Pinky was working the whole time, throughout the days he was guiding us, giving us rain gear, giving us time to stop and take photos and making adjustments to our bikes and at the end of the day he was finding local places to take us for dinner, helping to pack and unpack our bikes and doing maintenance on them. Pinky really cared about everyone on the trip and making sure they enjoyed themselves, he was very funny but also very serious about safety.The only issue we had was that we had organised for our Mum to come up to Sapa and do a two day trekking tour with Flamingo before we arrived. This didn't really work out very well as it didn't seem to have been organised even though it was all confirmed, so there was a lot of confusion when Mum arrived in Sapa. This was disappointing and seemed out of character for Flamingo Travel, especially given the otherwise excellent level of service we received.Thank you again to Pinky for his care and professionalism on the tour, it was above and beyond and really made for a memorable trip."

First of all, motorcycle trips in north vietnam are definitely recommended - almost any road you take has awesome views, and the people are very friendly. The XR250s that we rented were not new and understandably during more than 1500km over different roads/terrain had some issues - and here is the thing, Flamingo helped over the phone, talked to the local mechanics and took the support seriously for any issue that we called about. Which to my opinion is very important - you don't really want to be stuck 100s of km away with some problem and not getting that support. Which by itself is a reason to recommend Flamingo. Besides that, they are nice :) and you will get advice about the route."

Renting/buying motorbikes in Vietnam can be a daunting prospect, so going with a good company can save you a lot of hassle and money. We started in Hanoi and had originally planned to buy bikes and then sell them on after we had been to the north and down to Ho Ch Min City. We were recommended Flamingos by Hanoi Backpackers. As soon as we walked in to the Hanoi office we were greeted by Chris (from England) and after an extremely honest and helpful (.....and long!) chat with him going over all the options, we decided to rent two 125cc Hondas @ $13 per day to explore the north (Central & East) for 6 days. The bikes were absolutely fine and we had no problems at all and were very happy with them. You definitely need at least 125cc for the north and some of the roads are tough going.We then also arranged to take up Flamingos' rental deal to go from Hanoi to Ho Chi Min. For $185 per bike you have up to 21 days to do the journey on a 110cc Honda Win (note pretty much all the Honda bikes are Vietnamese copies!), which is extremely good value. The bikes were noticeably not as solid as the bikes we rented for the north, but we soon got used to them. The roads to go south are mostly in very good condition though, so this was not really a problem. My girlfriend had no real problems with her bike the whole trip. I had to have the suspension and clutch disks replaced. The problems were easy to fix though and Flamingos' provide you with a useful selection of spare parts. They also provide a 24hr breakdown phone number, so if you have any problem you can call them and they can speak to the mechanic to establish the problem and importantly a fair price. Overall we were very happy with the service provided. We drove almost 3000km and to only have a few problems is pretty good for this price. Along the way we met many people who had bought their bikes (generally between $200-250) and they were in the mechanics on a daily basis with all sorts of problems. If like us you don't know much about bikes, renting from these guys is a really good option. It is in their interest to keep the bikes in good condition, whereas buying is a bit of a gamble. All the staff, particularly Chris and all the girls in the Hanoi office definitely deserve a mention. They were very helpful arranging to have our bikes put on a train to the north and generally giving helpful, honest advice. Thanks a lot...we had an epic adventure! Nick & Andrea, London"

I didn't want to pay that much, because I know all my Vietnamese friends will laught when I will tell them the price. But I got promise, that in Hanoi I will get 250-300 USD (depend on the condition of a bike when I arrive) back. I tried a few more bikes, but only this one was in my eyes good enought to take all the way. And it was. During the road I had no problem with the bike, except electronic starter (which I managed to repair with a friends help in Hoi An). Finally in Ha Noi, I little bit doubt that I can get full price, even the bike was still in a perfect shape (and I clean, change the oil, fix the chain and check again everything). But at Flamingo Travel, they positively suprised me. At the end we agreed on 280 USD for the bike, so very good deal. Guys at Flamingo are nice, friendly and from my experience trustworthy.

A buddy and I used Flamingo (Hanoi) to rent a pair of 4 stroke Minsk 125's with luggage panniers for a 2 week unescorted tour that ended in Ho Chi Minh City.I was initially very unimpressed by the 2 bikes they brought to the shop for us, as being an amateur bike mechanic myself, I was able to instantly tell that along the line someone without spannering skill had been let loose on these machines, as many of the nuts and bolts were rounded off. A few of the bike's electronics were broken, such as the high beams and front brake light switches, but everything else (except for both speedometers) worked.The bikes themselves were a bit tatty and had obviously had long hard lives, but the engines were sound and ran really well.I am happy to report that cosmetic concerns aside, both bikes covered over 1500 miles under our custodianship, and they both ran on and on without let up no matter what we put them through.Flamingo themselves were faultless. The lady that runs the Hanoi branch was very knowledgeable and drew us up the perfect itinerary, and arranged all our train transfers and bike transport (we took a couple of over night trains with the bikes due to distances involved) which went smoothly, and the agents that she arranged for us in other towns (Lau Cai and Hue) all came though for us without problem. We had to lay out $500 deposit for the bikes, which seemed steep as I wouldn't have paid that to buy one of them, and I was initially worried that the HCM city branch would try and stiff us out of it, but my fears were utterly unfounded. The HCM branch were quite literally stood outside of their shop waiting for our arrival on the day we were due to arrive, and after a cursory look at the bikes, they returned our deposits on the spot.In my travels around Vietnam, I found the people to be good, decent and honest and will go out of their way to help a traveler out. Flamingo travel embody this cultural ethos, and I have no hesitation in recommending them for your motorbike touring needs.Only the less than expected condition of the bikes keeps me from giving them 5 out of 5, and for information, the bike I used was the very same one in their main photo on this page, but it's looking a bit tired since this pic was taken, but it did the job so I can't complain to much.Here is a clip of me using the bike in the stunning northwestern highlands https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsAp_kGzFCU"

My schedule was fixed: I had about 20 days to drive from Saigon to Hanoi, together with my girlfriend and some luggage. Of course everybody should know that this is an adventure, which is unlikely to be topped easily. I hoped finding a suitable vehicle wouldnt be such an adventure with unknown risk etc. Flamingo turned eventually provided the safety that I needed. With a simple contract, which bonds you to a certain deposit in case you crash the vehicle, they let you go. Also, they give you all necessary knowledge whcih you will need for the tour. How to approach mechanics, what to do what to say, and a bag with most needed quipment, which is likely to replace, wrecked prior parts. I also required their telephone help twice, since mechanics often try to rip off - those guys negotiate over the phone with the mechanics in case of doubt, which will happen.One exceptional case made me happy about the enterprise. One day before we returned the Bike in Hanoi, we had a wrecked part in the back tyre, changing and parts cost me approx. 700000 Dong, which is 35 dollar and rediculously expensive, compared to usual prices ( 5 dollar for instance for a big job). As I called them, I said its one day left of my contract, so Iasked them to reimburse the money, which they did by 50 %, that was ..awesome! Not because of the money, but the principle, those things do not usually happen in Vietnam . (BTW I rented the bike in Saigon and returned without problems in Hanoi, thats part of the thing)So nothing bad to say. Really good , really happy ! :)"

His English, knowledge and sense of humour really made our tours something quite special. My daughter had never sat on a motorbike before and my biking days were in the long and distant past but straight away, we felt well cared for and in the hands of professionals. We asked to see the real Vietnam and Tang understood exactly what we wanted. On the second tour, he and another rider travelled 2 hours to pick us up at our hotel and took us to Cuc Phoung. We had a brilliant ride there and then rode in to the centre of the park. Nothing was too much trouble or rushed. Learnt more about Vietnam in 2 days on the bikes than during the rest of our stay in this fantastic country. On both tours lunch was included and Tang found authentic places to eat."

Two of the adults rode their own bikes, while my 15-year-old daughter and I rode with drivers. A word to the wise: if you choose to drive your own bike, you won\u2019t get much of an introduction to riding, and first thing you\u2019ll ride across a crazy busy street to merge onto another crazy busy street. Not my cup of tea, but both my husband and friend who did it said at the end that although it was terrifying, they would definitely do it again.Our daughter rode with Minh, and he completely made the experience for her. He talked to her the whole time they were riding, telling her about Vietnam and what it\u2019s like to live there, talking about what we were seeing, etc. She\u2019s not a kid who warms easily to adults she doesn\u2019t know well, but she was completely taken by Minh.We spent a little more time in Hanoi than we would have liked \u2013 I mean, right in the city. And I think the regular tour spends even more time in the city than we did, but we told Ming we really wanted to see the surrounding area, since we could see all the Hanoi sights on our own, and he was happy to oblige. I thought the motorbike aspect would be a little nerve-wracking, but after the first few minutes, it wasn\u2019t scary at all. We went to a pottery village where we saw the \u201cfactories\u201d (I use this term so, so loosely). We went to an agricultural area where we tasted some sort of fruit from the trees (I can\u2019t remember what it was). And we visited the house/studio of an artist who happened to be home and was gracious enough to talk with us for a long time, give us a tour of his home and the grounds, and serve us tea. And we saw lots of the countryside, just seeing how people live day-to-day. The whole thing was an amazing experience.If we're lucky enough to make it back to Vietnam, we'd love to take a multi-day motorbike tour!"

Our guide Minh had just developed a new tour that took us up mountains and valleys through the north where we passed by incredible views of country life. Both nights we stayed with local ethnic minorities, and were warmly welcomed into their stilt homes.The food was excellent and we tried fantastic \"home-style\" cooking. The sights were outstanding - we couldn't have asked for more. We went for hours and hours without seeing another tourist and were treated to the excited 'hellos' from children delighted to see a foreigner passing by.If you want to see a part of Vietnam that exemplifies the simple country life, Minh will guide you there. Minh was professional and helpful throughout. The only part of the tour that we found a bit tough to navigate was through some wet mud. But if you're OK with getting a bit dirty at times, then you're gold. Overall - I would recommend Minh and his tour for a unique and adventurous way to explore the incredible scenery, culture, and people of Vietnam. Thanks Minh! \"Keep going, never give up!\""

It was slightly challenging navigating the traffic to get out of town, but if you ridden a scooter before and are not too timid then it's a breeze. There is method to the traffic madness in Hanoi and it's not hard to figure it outWe are not mad motor bikers, but figured this might be an interesting way to see the countryside in slower time and enjoy some of the sights and we were right. We went to a pottery factory, a wood carving village and then out into the countryside where we had a great lunch and some nice riding along country roads. The bikes were fine, both automatic, albeit one sounded like it might need some attention soon. It didn't detract from the experience though and we had a fascinating day. Recommended for a slightly different view and a different pace of tours around this fabulous area."

Chris being true to his word called me regularly to see how everything was going. Now how's that for personal service!? As for the trip itself, guys do it, you'll see & experience things not in the guide book, and it will make your time in Vietnam a very personal one. But take my advice do it with Flamingo Travel.

Trying to drive (dodge & weave) and follow a map would've been too much for us. Besides, Hue took us down mountain trails that were on no map giving us an opportunity to see some breathtaking scenery. Hue's personal story combined with his local knowledge and fun-loving nature (though always making safety a priority) won us over.I'll definitely be back to do another trip, this time on a larger CC bike. That said, the 110 cc Honda Waves we rode were more than up to the task at hand."

They even gave us a sheet of paper with useful phrases we may need on an A4 sheet of paper with the Vietnamese translation below, and told us to phone them if we got stopped by the police and were in a bit of bother.The bikes themselves were brilliant as well. We took out a Honda Wind, Honda Wave and a Honda Future. Had no problems with any of the bikes on the whole trip other than a couple of unavoidable punctures. Route we took was Ho Chi Min - Mui Ne - Nha Trang - Qui Nhon - Hoi An - Hue and then boarded a sleeper bus from to Hanoi with the bikes as cargo.Could not recommend Flamingo enough.

Attended the shop 3 days prior and sized up helmets and jackets (brought own gloves). Made instant friends with Chris and Hung (the owner) and shared a few meals and beers before heading off. Our guide was Pinky, an absolute champion of a bloke. Getting out of Hanoi was an incredible experience but riding our 4 stroke Minsks through the Vietnamese country side was unforgettable. Night 1 was a home stay with one of the best meals of our lives. Pinky introduced us to the local rice wine and the rest was history. Day 2 was even better riding around the lake until disaster struck. One of our mates came off his bike after hitting a dog. He managed to make it to Son La until we realised the full extent of his injury - a badly broken leg. This is where Pinky came to the fore. Son La is as remote as it gets. He got us to the hospital, went beyond the call of duty in getting us treated by various doctors, helped find crutches, arranged for us to get back to Hanoi and rang every day to follow up how we were going. He continued on with the trip to Sapa with two of our group and they had an excellent time.Arriving in Hanoi on the sleep bus Hung was there to meet us at the bus station. He got us into an alternative hotel. He took us to the hospital. He helped make arrangements. He showed genuine concern for our mates welfare. He visited us every day and couldn't do enough for us. We were having the time of our lives on this bike trip to Sapa (which I highly recommend) and Flamingo Travel in general were excellent. But both Pinky and Hung were outstanding when it came to helping out an injured and stranded tourist and customer. As a result I cannot recommend them enough. Both Pinky and Hung are men of outstanding character and their efforts in helping us will never be forgotten. If you are going to do a bike ride in northern Vietnam, go with Flamingo.

The typical problem people find is that the bargain bikes are in bad condition. Our group used Flamingo in Hanoi and bought a Minsk motorbike from them as well as servicing other bikes with their mechanics before we left. Their level of work was excellent and moderately priced, which is reassuring instead of quick/cheap fixes.The best part of our experience was when we were 3000km into our trip and having some mechanical difficulties in Laos. The mechanics in Laos didn't understand our bikes and communication was terrible. The owner Mr Hung was amazing - I called him and with simple explanation of the bike's symptoms he narrowed the problems down to a few things and then talked to the Vietnamese speaking mechanic. Bish bosh bash we had bikes working well again. In summary you can save maybe $50 by trying to buy from another backpacker, but will lose money with repairs needed before you leave and on the road. You also avoid frustrating communication problems further down the road by having Mr Hung on call as support."

We had a few hiccups on our journey but this was our doing not that of flamingo (punctures, getting lost, rain storms!) in fact we were confident in the bikes and Flamingo for the whole period.On arriving in HCM after a couple of hours riding in the traffic we found the hotel and were finished with our trip.A quick call to the HCM branch to give them our location ad they came to check over our bikes and collect them.This was an excellent service with documents and deposit returned readiily. My bike had some damage from a fall which resulted in the loss of a small amount of the deposit but this was very reasonable and fully justified.Over all I would highly recommend Flamingo to anybody who wants a bike but doesn't want the hassle of buying and selling one, also having confidence the bike has been maintained in good working order. Nice powerful bikes too!Over all loved them and couldn't recommend them more."

The bikes did not miss a beat. 10 days after we set off we arrived with no problems from any of the bikes even after so long hot days of non stop riding. After this we went to Sapa on 2 Honda XR250, They booked us on the over night train and changed the flight for the girls. They also took us to a snake restaurant stayed there for 2 hours. Amazing service.. Above and beyond!! Needless to say the XR250's were amazing on the mountain roads around Sapa and the north of Vietnam. Thank you Flamingo travel"

Flamingo were helpful and professional and they even put an extra rack on the back of the bike for our bag, they gave me advice for the bike and riding in Vietnam and took me to the gas station to show me which oil to get and how to mix it up. All in all the bike was great, but one day the gears started to play up until it wouldn't change out of second. We stopped at the first mechanic and they pulled it apart, welded something and put it back together in about 40 minutes, it cost us less than $10 USD and we were on our way again, great fun. I think it was a couple of dollars more expensive per day to rent from these guys, but for us it was worth it."

They were super fast in replying to my emails and help full beyond belief. Because of the distance I was doing the bike I was given \"a Honda future X\" was in perfect condition and was trouble free all the way. They even arranged accommodation for my time in Hanoi and gave me maps routes address and phone numbers of people and places to stay along the way. If you need bike riding gear they will sort you out with that also, I got mine of them as it saved me carrying it with me before I got to Hanoi. I don't know about the tours that they do but if your doing a trip by yourself don't waste your time looking around for days like i did and just call these guys because they will sort EVERYTHING and take the worry out of it all for you. As for what it cost, well that was just a joke, form memory \"cause it was June 2012 when I done my trip\" for the hire for 2weeks and leaving it in HCMC and getting them to arrange putting it on the train back to Hanoi it was about $200 AUD \"It would cost you more to not wear your seatbelt in Sydney for 2mins\"Honestly they are champions.

While I haven't been on any of their tours my girlfriend and I have hired scooters from them for around the city over a number of months before eventually buying some. Mechanically they were faultless and were still subject to monthly services that kept them ship-shape. Flamingo aren't the cheapest in the city, however they are the best value, as they offered sound safe motorbikes but more importantly an excellent understanding of customer service. I was unlucky to be involved in an accident (not on their bike) and was unable to ride my hired bike for 2 weeks - they allowed me to extend the hire period to allow for my time 'out of action' at no extra charge. They were also understanding and trusting when I turned up a week late to pay one month because I'd got my weeks mixed up.Unlike many motorbike businesses elsewhere in Vietnam and Asia they are honest and make pains to deliver good service, instead of many other businesses that try and rip you off for imagined scratches etc."

However, a guide took me out of the city for 15$, a good investment for staying alive.I have no knowledge at all in repairing mechanical problems, but I never had any issue with the motorbike (future neo). No flat, no motor-breaking. The bike conditions were perfect when I rented it and, even if I would of have any problem, I knew I had 24/7 assitance. This is without condition the biggest higlight of my trip. The scenery is as beautiful as Halong bay and the feeling of driving in these mountains are truly awesome. If you have 10 days, I suggest you to do Dien bien phu - Sapa - Hanoi. If you have some more days to spare, you should definitly continue after sapa to Ha giang, then to Cao bang. Do NOT get to Cao bang by Lang son. The roads are in bad conditions and very boring and this is the only part of my trip that I regret. Prepare yourself to see no other tourist, except for Dien bien phu and Sapa."

At first I was a little suspicious cause that's just who I am. I don't like getting ripped off. But my concerns went out of the window when I met Hue. We talked about the trip and and all the alternatives and then I booked a tour around the north west. It was awesome. This is not some agency just looking for your money. They really take care of you and my 250 Honda was just perfect. They have a workshop for their bikes working 24/7 to make sure you have a reliable bike. I do not want to go into detail about the tour because it would just be too much but when I had a flat tyre we had everything about to fix it. I was very impressed by that. When you book a tour ask for Hue as your guide. He is a little too careful at first but once he realises that you can ride he trusts you and he gives you more space if you want to. But he will always be at your side and help you or order food for you or whatever. He knows a lot of local people too so if you like travelling of the beaten track like me he is your guy. I know this sounds probably like some faked recommendation cause it sounds too praising but trust me, this is the agency to go to. Have a save trip"

We tried local foods along the roadside, took fun side trips off the main road, and got so much more out of our time in Vietnam be getting off the beaten path, and by being led by Son (our guide). He made the trip amazing and was great company.The first part of the trip getting out of Hanoi is harrowing...but once you get out of the city, it is beautiful. Each day in the countryside had different geography and vistas. The food was all just delicious. The people are so friendly and we did not see another tourist for the entire 4 days of our trip until we got to Sapa.My only suggestion is that Flamingo give a packing list. In addition to long pants and \"real shoes\", I would wear a long sleeve, cotton, button down shirt with a short sleeve t shirt underneath. I got sunburned on my first day. Even lips and hands. The Vietnamese women wear light zip up coats with flaps that go over hands and a hood. Not a bad idea!You can pick one up at the street shops in Hanoi. Don't forget eye protection (sunglasses are fine) and a small towel and some toiletries. One homestay did not provide soap or towels, so we used a dirty t-shirt to dry off. Other than that, pack light!One thing I loved is that you just pay for your drinks once you have paid for the tour. You can have mulitple beverages (alcoholic and non) for just a few bucks. We spent hardly anything.I know this trip is something our family will always remember as a great highlight. Flamingo travel can help you plan other excursions too.

The bike I chose was the Honda xr250 which was perfect for overcoming some of the obstacles we found or just cruising the highways. Staying in home stays in tiny villages where they hardly see a tourist or a bike that's not a scooter was a highlight. I swam in a beautiful limestone river overlooking rice Patties and Vietnamese jungle. I saw caves that had never been explored and met so many friendly villagers and families. this is only a part of what I experienced in only 3 days.

He was very helpfull when I began to plan my trip sending by mail a lot of informations...even pictures of the bike and the saddle bags and measures. I've travelled for 6057 km, starting from Hanoi and doing the North Loop ( Dien Bien Phu-Sapa-Ha Giang-Meo Vac-Cao Bang-Lang Son-Halong Bay) and back to Hanoi. After I've driven to Ho Chi Min City most of the time along the Ho Chi Min Trail, but crossing twice the country est-west to can stop in Hu\u00e8 and My Lai.As regards the bike I had just to refill the engine oil, put gas and inflate tires, no one problem. My bike was an Yamaha Serow 230 cc little, but perfect to travel in Vietnam. Little bit hard the seat, but when I went back in Hanoi mechanic had a brilliant idea and fixed an extra padded saddle for just 5 $.If you have problems you can always call the office in Hanoi and they answer in perfect english.

I spend a lot of time researching a number of companies to hire motorbikes from in Vietnam and I am so glad that we finally picked Flamingo Travel. These guys are a class act.From start to finish their level of service and customer care was outstanding. I should mention Hung in person as he was so patience with me and helped in everylittle detail. A friend and I were travelling on our own and he even suggested the best routes, bikes etc for us.The team worked above and beyond our expectations in order to ensure we were happy.So enough about the customer care - lets get onto the bikes !Bike hire anywhere can be dangerous - you need to make sure you have a well serviced chariot to keep you safe. We were recomended the Yamaha YBR125 for our trip from Hanoi to Hoi-An and they never let us down. You read about horror stories and nightmare of breaking down but the well serviced and maintained machines provided by Flamigo never once let us down. Over 1400km`s of country and not a single problem.Hung arranged for us to meet a rep in Hoi-An for us to return the bikes to. This was where we had dreams of not being refunded as a scratch had suddenly appeared or something - this was not the case. The rep checked the bikes and gave us our refund back in full along with the copies of our rental agreement and passports.If you are thinking of hiring bikes in Vietnam, you will probably have done lots of research and see the countless options - bottom line hire from these guys.

To start with, we absolutely wanted to see everything! That's why we chose to travel by motorbike, a great way to travel independently. 'Cause that's another thing we really wanted. After some research we came to the conclusion that it really is the way to travel through Vietnam. So... That's how we found Flamingo Travel. If you've never been to Vietnam before it's not that easy to find something in Hanoi but as long as you have an address, taxi's get you everywhere. We called upfront to check if they still had a Minsk we could hire. They did. As we arrived we discussed prizes and type's of Minsk's. We chose not to go for the traditional Minsk with the 2-stroke engine but we chose for the adapted and improved 4-stroke (Minsk body with an SYM engine, not real genuine but a great choice!). We started our trip with the North-western loop, ending in Sapa. Which means we had a lot of hard roads in front of us with mountain passes and dirt roads. So we expected to have some setbacks as well, flat tyres, running out of gaz, battery problems, not enough power to go uphill, etc...None of that was true, we had no setbacks whatsoever! It's amazing, as long you fuel that little tank in time, he just kept pushing till the end. It really is an amazing bike thanks to the care and maintenance of the Flamingo Travel staff. The bike had everything you would want to start a rough trip like that, it carried us and our backpack on every kind of road and every kind of hill. We arrived back at Hanoi with great succes. We were so convinced about the bike that we asked them if it was possible to use this same bike to travel from Hue to Saigon. They arranged everything for us, they inspected the bike, did maintenance, checked the drive-train, changed the oil and arranged the tickets to put the bike on the train. While they shipped the bike, we asked them to book us a trip to Halong Bay. As I said, they arranged everything we asked them.We also didn't have any problems with the bike travelling from Hue to Saigon.That is why I want to conclude with This..If you plan on travelling through Vietnam and you start in Hanoi.. Flamingo Travel is THE company you should count on, they will arrange everything you want and they do it at a fair price. If I would travel through Vietnam again, I would definitely count on Flamingo Travel again!"

I wanted to go for a ride into the country side and tour some villages and meet some locals. They organised a guide and we went out for a day into the Hanoi hinterland. Any one who has been to Hanoi will know the traffic is a challenge, their guide Ling was great, getting me through some of the trickiest intersections and eventually out into the villages. Once in the country side they have a network of local families who will host you for lunch and have some good interaction with the locals. Riding through the walled villages and rice fields was a highlight.Their bikes are good for Vietnam standards and are appropriate for the riding you do. Would like to come back with a few mates and do a longer tour up north.Andrew"

My husband rented a Suzuki DRZ400 from Flamingo Travel for 5 days in November, and we had a great adventure on our own riding around Hanoi and the outskirts, and overnight to Ninh Binh to visit Tam Coc and Phat Diem Cathedral. It was very easy to rent the motorcycle on the internet from Flamingo, and correspondence was easily handled by e-mail. They were very helpful answering our questions before we arrived. The rental process itself was very smooth and professional and picking up the bike was easy. The mechanic provided a bag of spare parts and went over what was provided and what might need to be repaired. We rode around Hanoi, and outside into the surrounding area (Bat Trang village to the east, Chua Thay pagoda to the SW) and had a great time being part of the mayhem that is Hanoi traffic. The bike was excellent on the ride down to Ninh Binh, as QL1 disintegrates into dirt road and off-road conditions in a number of places between Hanoi and Ninh Binh. The big bike attracted a lot of attention, and it was great fun talking to people about it and our gear. The motorcycle, while an older model, was very well maintained and ran great, no need for the spare parts. This was our third trip to Vietnam (4th for my husband) and truly the best experience yet. Returning the bike was very easy, all the paperwork was in order and our deposit returned with no problems. We would definately rent again from Flamingo Travel, they are a great resource."

Road can be very demanding for driver and especially for Motorcycle. Everyday I wrote in my journal gratitudes to guys over flamingo for keeping motorbikes in perfect order, didn't have any problem with mine even after 8 days of mountain riding. On top of them they helped me to plan our trip, put it on the map and gave us list of places where we could stay overnight, you don't have to follow, but it's a good safety net.Anyway, I wanted to travel by motorcycle for a long time and finally my dream came thru thanxxx to Flamingo!"

We also ate traditional food at local eateries. It was probably best food I ate during my 3 weeks in Vietnam.The tour was well run, and is okay for people with no experience motorbiking. I was in this situation. The learner session held before the tour helped me get used to Vietnamese roads.I recommend Flamingo Travel to anyone interested in motorbiking and seeing Vietnam."

They helped us with a lost passport, finding unique gifts for people back home, I can't say enough great things about them. They can also help you find any type of holiday or hotel you may need in Vietnam. The greatest travel agent in Vietnam and they don't charge for information.Great people, knowledgable and if and when I make it back I will be visiting them as soon as I land.

This meant that we enjoyed a very high level of personalised service, and although in destinations such as Ho Chi Minh we were booked into group tours, in Hue and Hanoi we had our own dedicated guide. In Hanoi we also met the lovely Ms Loan in person, who despite it being a Sunday afternoon, took the time to come to our hotel to wish us a pleasant stay armed with mementos from Vietnam as gifts!During the tour, when we had a query Ms Loan responded quickly and when my husband left his reading glasses on a bus, she tracked them and ensured their return.With limited time to explore the country, Vietlongs careful planning and local knowledge meant that our stay was packed with highlights. In fact looking back at our photos, it doesn't seem possible to have seen and done so much in the time!Before we booked we compared the itinerary on offer with similar UK operators, and found Vietlong to be extremely competitive on price.We were so impressed that will be using Vietlong to arrange a trip to Camodia & Laos next year.So in summary, if you want to make the most of your precious holiday time and hard earnt money, then Vietlong is the 'go to' tour company."

In the humidity of a Vietnam summer riding a bike is the only way to avoid constant sweating due to the cool air in your face when you ride. We did two 1 day tours but we wish we'd done a lot more!We hired 3 automatic bikes. We'd never ridden any mopeds before but they were really easy to ride and lots of fun. No problems with bikes, good condition etc. So don't worry about that.For My Son Tour, the roads are mostly quiet and the scenery is good. The temples are good too. Putting bikes on a rickety wooden river boat crossing was pretty cool. Would recommend.For Hanoi to Hue via Da Nang, the views are epic as you climb the mountain pass. There's a bit more main road riding on this tour than My Son but it's not scary and still get good views along the way. There's a stopping point at an outdoor swimming park, it's like a river flowing down a cliff that's been converted. A bit touristy but food great, swimming nice and would have been a natural wonder before it got touristy.Lots of good stopping points on both routes with good food/drinks and views. Our guide was cool too, ex Lieutenant in the army.All three of us enjoyed it a lot and came away wishing we'd put more biking in to our itinerary."

This tour was a custom tour as we wanted a few days rest here and there throughout the adventure. We had 2 days in Sapa and 2 Days in Ba Be Park.The tour guides were amazing. They were helpful and polite and made us feel comfortable, they even picked up on some Aussie humor and starting to give it back to us, which was good to see. The route chosen by the company was perfect, with a good mix of everything from highways, dirt roads, home stays, beautiful scenery, off road trails, stops at villages and even the odd waterfall swim.The booking process by emails was fairly smooth and seemed to work ok.The whole tour was really good and would recommend anyone wanting to ride and experience the real Vietnam to jump on board with Vietlong. However, as a seasoned traveler there are a couple of things that need to be said bearing in mind that the whole experience is fantastic, and we have traveled to Vietnam 2 years ago and rode with a different company which was also good, but one needs to be honest with other potential travelers:1) The XR250 bikes that we paid a higher price for (even though 2 of the 7 were 175cc) were pretty flogged out and needed some immediate work. Shocks, clutch and tyres were all in need of replacement as a minimum. That said, we did not expect new bikes, but we did expect better considering the price per person paid.2) As mentioned above, the guides were fantastic, but the 2 we had were not trained in any type of first aid (Vietlongs responsibility not the individaul). And as it happened there was a medical emergency along the way that could have been disastrous had the other members of our group had not had training and own medication (including the \"green whistle for pain relief). Even though the 2 guides did everything they could to help, but really could only be used as translators in that situation. And because we were off the tourist route, hospitals and doctors are very limited and when found, very basic.Other then the 2 points mentioned above (which is why they are \"very good\" and not \"excellent\"), I would recommend this tour company. Would I use these guys again? Yes of course it was a fantastic trip."

Floating villages were also good as was the cruise - very relaxing and with only 20 passengers on board it felt very intimate and personal. The chef who only looked in his early 20ies coped marvellously with 5 vegetarians, 3 of whom did eat egg either, first class food.

Tour guides in all places were always on time, speaking good English, knowledgeable & experienced too. They showed us all the most special things in Vietnam which we have not seen before. We highly appreciate Ms. Candy for buying us a dinner in Hanoi and so beautiful lacquer boxes as lovely gifts from Vietnam. Everything on tour was really flawless and we'll surely recommend this agent to my friends."

            "review": "Citrus Holidays 13 day tour of Cambodia and Vietnam. The Holiday13-day tour of Cambodia and Vietnam. Booked through Citrus Holidays in the UK but presented by VietLong Travel locally. 16th to 30th March 2016.Value for money: Good. Recommended: Yes. We upgraded both flights (to Deluxe Economy) and hotels from the basic package. The tour guides were excellent, both knowledgeable on the area and helpful in general.They take customer satisfaction very seriously. Expect a visit on the last evening from a VietLong representative to ask for impressions and any suggestions for improving the experience. FlightsThis was a first time experience with Vietnam Airlines and there are some pretty awful reviews of them. This may have been the situation in the past but this experience was of a friendly and efficient cabin crew that made both going and returning a pleasure. Internal flights are all basic economy class but then they only last an hour or so. The flights from/to LHR (in Deluxe Economy), were some of the best ever taken, easily outclassing Virgin.One gripe only, it\u2019s impossible to make the VN Airlines online check in system work. It crashes both in the UK and Vietnam. Turn up early to get the right seats.MoneyCambodia primarily uses the American dollar. Everything is priced in dollars and the only time local currency (Real) is seen is when change is less than one dollar.Vietnam still uses the Dong but there are plenty of places where the dollar is happily accepted (Hotel bills are quoted in either).The days of a three course meals with a bottle of wine for \u00a35 are gone. Granted it\u2019s still cheaper than the UK but inflation has hit the area. Although it\u2019s still possible to have a cheap meal in a backpacker restaurant a really good steak dinner, for two, in Saigon can cost VND1.60m, about \u00a350/$71. Good old credit card.Don\u2019t however assume that dollars are accepted everywhere. At least one restaurant didn\u2019t accept them and paying with a credit card was a nightmare. Best to check before ordering.Credit cards are accepted fairly widely but again don\u2019t assume it. ATMs are also fairly widely available but will always deliver the largest denomination notes possible. Request VND50,000 and you\u2019ll get a VND50,000 note, which you then have to get changed.GeneralMarch is one of the hottest times in Cambodia/South Vietnam with temperatures around 38c + humidity. Only Hanoi was cooler at around 21c. The main form of transport in Hanoi and Saigon (Ho Chi Minh) is the moped/scooter and crossing the road is truly frightening. Try and find a crossing, then, when the traffic eases off walk slowly and carefully across the road. Don\u2019t run or make any sudden moves. The traffic will flow around you but watch out in both directions and look out for the occasional speed king."

Arrival at airports was so smooth. There was always a driver and guide waiting for you. Every hotel was 5* staff , room & food. The guide would explain exactly what was going to happen at each city and give times and agency's. Nothing was too much trouble. We had a 12 day tour which was hectic but have us an insight into Cambodia & Vietnam. We would of liked more time in Saigon as we didn't have time to visit the Killing Fields or The Royal Palace & Silver Pagoda. There would be a very long list of everything we did do but it was all fantastic. 10/10. Would highly recommend Vietlong Travel."

Completed a 7day 1200km loop from Hanoi and can not say enough about the trip and Vietlong travel.Firstly the online service was excellent and Mr Minh answered all of my questions about tour options and pricing. It was this prompt service which made me choose them over other companies. Everything was well organised and ran to plan.Guide. Quynh my guide was fantastic and can't praise him enough for showing me around his country and sharing his knowledge. It was a perfect blend of being looked after but also being challenged on some of the lesser known roads that he showed me. It was these little side roads and adventures that were the highlight of my trip. BTW, do not take this trip with any company if you are new to riding as you really need a medium to above average skill level to keep yourself and others safe while still enjoying yourself.Accomodation was first rate and really enjoyed the homestays and meeting the families and other travellers, didn't mind a bit of the ole rice wine either. The hotels were good and I was always comfortable.The equipment. The XR 250 I hired was great, she had a few kays but I went over everything before we left Hanoi and everything had obviouly been greased and serviced, brakes, tyres and lights all top condition. Old Red never cave me a lick of trouble and performed faultlessly. Quynh gave me a helmet but the rest of the gear I took myself. Should say that you should pack for everything as temps ranged from 2 deg to 27 deg and had sunshine, rain, fog, cloud. Quynh even took me to a local market on the 3rd day to buy rubber washing up gloves and we taped plastic bags to our feet to keep dry. Kept us comfortable in the saddle.Food was great on tour and had everything from street food to home cooked meals. You won't go hungry.So in summary the trip was excellent but the star of the show is Vietnam itself. The scenery between Ha Giang, Dong Van and Ba Be lake is amonst the best in the world and I have seen some pretty amazing places after 20 years of overseas travel. If you love motorcycles and riding the roads here are exceptional and their are more hairpins, crests, sweepers, climbs and descents than you can handle.So stop thinking about it and just do it!"

When in Saigon we visited the ChiChi tunnels, and was good to be in the shade and we paid an extra amount to return to Saigon on the riverboat which was quicker and more interesting than the coach back. Very impressed with all the staff at Vietlong Travel. We cancelled the last days walking tour because we just wanted to chill . Enjoyed the foot massage arranged by Citrus.

Everything, and I mean everything, ran like clockwork. We were met after our flight in Siem Reap by a driver and guide who had patiently waited for us. We were delayed with having to arrange and pay for a visa at the airport. They were both extremely pleasant and not put out at all by the delay. They took us to our hotel in Siem Reap and spent time with us at the hotel making sure we understood all the arrangements that they were making for us. The hotel was very comfortable and clean with very attentive staff. It was the Villa Medamrei Hotel. The following days we were met by the guide and taken by private limousine to the Angkor Wat temples. That evening the guide arranged for us to attend a Chinese buffet and folk dancing dropping us off and picking us up when the show ended. We then went on a boat trip on the Tonle Sap Lake the following morning. Everything was well arranged and we had a boat to ourselves. After lunch at a nice restaurant we were taken on a tour of the city. The following morning we were again picked up by the guide and taken to the bus station where we boarded a bus for the journey to Phnom Penn. We were met by a different guide who advised us of various options of things to do in Phnom Penh. The hotel we stayed in was the Silver River Hotel which was very comfortable. We hired a tuk-tuk and were taken to the killing fields, a Cambodian prison camp and temples and palaces. On day six we were picked up by the guide and car and taken to the bus station where we were driven aboard a luxury coach to Saigon. On arrival we were met by a driver and guide and taken to the Signature Saigon Hotel. The staff were very nice and nothing was too much trouble. The guide and driver picked us up the following day and took us to the cu chi tunnels and then a tour of Saigon. The guide was very knowledgeable and very entertaining. Day 8 we were driven to the airport and flew to Hanoi where we were met by a guide and driver. That evening we went to a water puppet show. The following day the guide arrived at the hotel and we went on a walking tour of Hanoi visiting nearly all the places of interest. We were booked into the Essence d'Orient Hotel in the heart of the old town. Day 9 we were picked up at the hotel and driven to Halong Bay where we boarded the Flamingo, a very comfortable wooden ship. The weather was not very good but we still had a fabulous time and very good food on board. We stayed overnight and after a leisurely morning were again transferred to Hanoi and the essence d'orient Hotel. This hotel was superb with fantastic staff and excellent food. We then spent two days at leisure in Hanoi. On the last day we were collected by the guide and driver and taken to the airport. The guide accompanied us to the check in and stayed with us until we went through to the departure gates. He made sure everything went well and we were happy before he left us. This was the best organised holiday we have ever been on and everybody we met was extremely friendly and accommodating. The guides all spoke excellent English and gave us lots of tips of what to do and where to go in our free time. Highly recommended throughout."

You knew it was going to be perfect with the ease of booking, loads of confirmations and answers to any and every question.Our fantastic guide KC (Thanh Cong) worked us out really quickly and customised the tour along the way. He caught on pretty quickly that our interest was in getting off the beaten track a little, eating food (and having a few beers), and getting in amongst it rather than do some of the more tourist things.Lots of random stops along the way at some pretty cool places.KC kept us safe at all times and made sure we were immersed in all the local stuff as well as some of the more touristy things! His knowledge and narrative kept us informed.We rode down some amazing little tracks & pathways, had random stops for food at peoples houses (fresh caught Mekong prawns and fish was a highlight), experienced some unforgettable scenery and had many laughs along the way!We started at 8:00am on day 1 and arrived at the home stay around 5:30pm.Hong Thai Homestay was just awesome. The dinner was incredible (too much food to describe here, but lot's of it and some sensational fresh fruit that you couldn't resist!!), the beer was ice cold and the hammocks a welcome relief to our bums after a day in the saddle! Mr Thai even procured some of the local banana wine for a nightcap (or two).OK, the bed isn't a 5 star hotel bed, but if that is ALL you are looking for, then perhaps this tour isn't for you!

Also the hotel in Hanoi situated in the old town where the rooms were good and the staff were eager to please.One of the highlights was the Halong trip and its activities which were wonderful and the food and service were absolutely excellent.The balance between having organised tours or events and free time to explore was just right.I'd certainly recommend this holiday."

Having your own English speaking guide was great - the flexibility suited us. Arrived in Siem Reap to see Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Bayon Temple, Tonle Sap Floating village, etc. However after talking with our guide we also fitted in the silk factory, an elephant ride and a few other temples. Travelled to Phnom Penh by bus (took 6 hours) visited National Museum, Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda, Genocide Museum and the Killing Field of Choeung Ek. Travelled to Ho Chi Minh City by bus (took 8 hours) visited Cu Chi Tunnels, Reunification Palace, War Remnant Museum, etc. Ben Thanh Market is amazing - only issue is most of the stalls are very similar.Flew to Hanoi - travelled to Halong Bay by bus (4 hour trip). One night Cruise was really nice and we were lucky to have great weather. On our return did a walking tour visiting the Ho Chi Minh Complex, One Pillar Pagoda, Temple of Literature, Water Puppet show, etc.We felt the trip was really well organised to fit as much as possible in to the time we were in each city. The price of the tour was really good compared to other tours we looked at doing, with the bonus of a private tour guide at each stop. The only thing we would suggest is look at paying the extra for a flight to avoid the long bus trips. All questions asked by us in emails prior to the trip were met with a very punctual reply.Vietlong Travel organised a fantastic holiday for us and we would recommend them to anyone travelling to this area of the world. All accommodation was centrally located so we walked everywhere and although we stayed at 3 Star Hotels we couldn't fault the standard of service we received. All our guides were excellent."

They did a fist class job for us. As 6 seniors doing Vietnam for the first time they made this part of the trip great. All travel and excursion's were done and times set for pick ups met. Thanks to the company for their care and friendliness especially Ms HA THAI NGUYEN for meeting us on the last morning, and presenting us with a small gift each and a farewell postcard from herself, a lovely little touch"

At each of the cities we were met at the airport or bus station and taken to the hotel in a comfortable car (and taken at the end to whatever our next transport was). All of the hotels were very well sited for the local things to do and see and were generally of a good standard. The day tour in each city was excellent and in most cases we had the guide and driver to ourselves. In all cases they were local guides with excellent local knowledge and all of the days were very interesting and varied. In all cases the driver was careful and the transport very comfortable. We would highly recommend this way of travelling."

VietLong Travel was very helpful in organising and setting up a 7 day motorbike tour for me. They were extremely quick to respond and were very friendly and willing to go above and beyond to make sure my tour was exactly what I wanted. The guide they set me up with, Quang, was professional and someone I now consider a friend for life. Thank you VietLong Travel for all the help. Would recommend for anyone wanting to experience the real Vietnam!"

We had selected a two day tour from Hue to Hoi An with a small company but found that insurance companies would only provide cover if we had a written contract (not offered by the first company). After a bit more research we found that Vietlong Travel and their Vietnam-motorbike Tours offered the very same tour and would provide not only the necessary safety equipment but also the paperwork required by our insurance company.Mr Minh at Vietlong was excellent to deal with and extremely responsive to our questions while we were making arrangements. he was also very flexible in arranging to come to our hotel in Hanoi to receive our final payment. Three of us rode ourselves and my wife went pillion. Our guide, Quang, was excellent, taking us to a variety of 'non-touristy' places from hot springs, to bee farms, homes where rice wine was being made, and local eateries. We only met one other English-speaking tourist in the whole two days, and that was someone working their way through Vietnam.Quang knew a lot about the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the entire region we rode through, and spoke really good English. Best of all he, rode at a really safe speed wherever we went (which was great, given two of us were not overly experienced.All food and drink, including the occasional local bia, was all covered in the cost.The experience was definitely five star. Just be prepared - you get on the bike and 20 seconds later you are riding in traffic Vietnam style!!"

I emailed Vietlong travel after a recommendation from a friend, and they were amazing. Speedy responses, reasonable prices for a private driver (especially when we actually did the journey! It was horrendous and our driver drove for 11hours on roads that were barely roads driving around the side of mountain after mountain in the dark for most of the way, poor guy! He only stopped for us to go to the loo and buy food! And kept checking we were ok despite not speaking any English!) and easy payment. We also used a driver in Cambodia for the 3 hour drive to the airport. Really, really would recommend them!"

I and my family did take a 2 day trip that is being run by Viet Long Travel \u2013 owner of the cruise. Actually we were confused amongst tens of cruises in Halong, then I searched budget cruise and I found Royal Heritage Cruise. We booked this trip through its website and we enjoyed it.The cruise\u2019s pictures are quite the same as shown on site and right after getting on the boat we had lunch. Amazingly, the food was fantastic with almost fresh seafood! My mother doesn\u2019t eat meat but she was arranged vegetarian dishes instead and of course, she was so happy with that flexible offer. We had 2 rooms next door that were around 14m2. The bathroom was clean and quite nice, the rooms were comfortable with a big enough window so that I was really excited with looking out the scenery from bed.One more thing I would like to share that our guide on cruise was so cool, Quyet, he told us useful infos about Halong and many funny stories that now we do remember, so coolll!!In short, it was my good experience. I do recommend this cruise and wish come back to Vietnam soon and enjoy Halong Bay again with Vietlong Company."

This review is supposedly for Vietlong private day tours but I am actually reviewing a total holiday arranged by Vietlong travel.I applied directly to Vietlong Travel for their best Vietnam and Cambodia two week tour and then arranged my international flights myself. I would highly recommend this to anybody travelling to Vietnam as involving a UK travel agent just incurs far more cost which is totally unnecessary as Vietlong Travel are quite capable of dealing with absolutely everything as long as you can book your own flights to Vietnam (so easy - we went Thai airways).I cannot praise this company too much as for us they planned and arranged a superb trip to Vietnam and Cambodia. They dealt with absolutely everything including providing the necessary documentation to get your visas on arrival in Vietnam rather than the pain of having to apply first to the embassy in the UK.Our trip was complex and involved many locations, hotels, tours and internal flights yet everything went like clockwork.We flew to Ho Chi Minh city (still Saigon to the locals) and were met at the airport by our friendly Vietlong guide who accompanied us to our hotel and took care of the checkin. The next day we were picked up at the hotel for private guided tours of the city and to the Chu Chi Tunnels (used by vietcong in the war - very interesting).We were then picked up and taken to the airport to fly to Cambodia. On arrival in Siem Reap we were again met at the airport by a friendly guide who took us to our great hotel and again handled the checkin. Next day we were picked up in the morning and taken on a private day tour of the amazing Angkor Wat complex by our very helpful guide.From Cambodia we flew back to Da Nang and were again met and transported to the wonderful Hoi An Riverside Resort where we spent a few amazing days.We were then picked up again and transported to the airport to fly to Hanoi. Again picked up and taken to a great hotel to stay one night. We were then picked up to transfer to an overnight cruise to Ha Long bay on Heritage Cruises (a partner of Vietlong) - absolutely stunning!Then back to Hanoi in the same hotel and had a guided tour if the city, a massage in the spa and an evening at the water puppet theatre - all included!I cannot describe all of these experiences here and will do so individually on separate reviews. What I want to say here is that I have to recommend VietLong tours for an incredibly well planned holiday, where they chose excellent hotels, arranged interesting tours and made it all run so smoothly that we never had any worries at all.On our very last day the Vietlong representative in Hanoi even came to visit us in our hotel to get feedback and give us some nice gifts - this was a very nice touch which along with everything else just goes to show that this is a company that really cares that their clients have a good time.From day one when I booked and could converse with the Vietlong staff on skype to the very end I felt like we were really being looked after.I would very highly recommend this company to anybody visiting Vietnam. They have many other tour plans to offer as well as the one we took. Just look at their website (vietlongtravel.com) and feel secure in the fact that whatever you choose they will do their very best to ensure that you enjoy every minute without any snags.Most highly recommended."

Our friends used outstanding services from this agent in Mar and that is why we trusted. At the very start, Loan performed to be a very experienced travel expert advising us so many worthy things about the trip and she was also very patient to email back & forth so many questions from us. She got all services confirmed very quickly and guided us to deposit to secure the trip to professioonally. We began the trip from Hanoi & our first tour guide welcoming us at the airport is Mr. Tien who is guide young but speaking English so well and highly educated. He knows so many things about the politics, ongoing world issues, history... shared with us about the war in Vietnam, the relations between Vietnam and US... etc. We are also fond of the overnight trip to Bhaya cruise in Halong Bay which is really a 4-star luxury hotel floating on water, our kids got a real surprise with all kinds of foods and loved kayaking around the islands. We then flew to Da Nang - Hoi An for a truly beach vacation. We stayed at Hoi An Boutique hotel right on the beach side & it looks so fantastic. During the time here, we joined with some other tourists to hand on a cooking class at Tra Que village and learned to be farmers. And through this cooking class, we had a chance to know more about the culinary culture of Vietnam and taste very delicious local foods. thanks to the instructions from our tour guide, We all were especially so moved when coming to visit the disable children in the suburb of Hoi An who are mostly victims of Agent Orange left behind the war. We wished there would not be any war on earth.We said good-bye to Hoi An after 4 nights to go to Saigon and Mekong Delta where is the South of Vietnam. We all do love visiting orchards in Vinh Long on small sampans and tried local fruits here. There are too many special things awaiting for your explorations in Vietnam and for sure, we'll return this land one day"

Honestly we sent our tour inquiries to some different travel agents but surprisingly Mr. Dong from Viet Long is the first person responding to our email. He answered some our questions very clearly and informatively then built up a very interesting trip covering almost highlights of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia for 18 days. Comparing the price with other agents, factually Mr. Dong's price is just a bit higher than other's but all hotels suggested by him is much more reliable & highly guaranteed because they all are in the top 20 of highest ranking hotels and here is also the reason we chose him to book with. Our tour was taken place in the end of May and amazingly he often called us to cross-check the services to ensure that we were enjoying the trip. We especially loved the resort and the cruise in Halong Bay because of the location and outstanding in-door facilities and the attitudes of staffs and we also do like cooking classes in Hoi An where we joined with other tourists to learn cooking traditional Vietnamese cuisines and enjoyed together. We can not speak out all our sweet memories about this trip and we personally respect and appreciate all the team of Vietlong did for us because we perceived that you put your heart in work. We'll surely return South East to explore Myanmar & Philippine next time and use Vietlong again."

First for all, let me say \"thank you\" Mr. Dong for your professional & efficient working manners as well as your cares for our trip from the start till the end. Everything is truly amazing & exactly what we planned. We're not used to posting up comments on such a tripadvisor but this time we break our traditional practices. We heard about Viet Long Travel through our friend's recommendations who did buy a tour from this company in 2014. We emailed to Mr. Dong to customize a tour which might fit our personal desires and incredibly he responded to us so quickly with some travel plans and ideal consultations. We started up our tour from Saigon then flew over Siemreap for Angkor Wat and flew to Da Nang - Hoi An for 5 nights of beach relaxation before going to Hanoi and Halong Bay. All hotels chosen by Mr. Dong have a very high ranking on Tripadvisor and centrally located. When we were on tour, sometimes Mr. Dong called us to cross-check the services as well as tour, satisfactions and he really got mark 10 from us for the night on cruise in Halong Bay. He secretly arranged a birthday party for my wife on cruise with candles, roses, cakes and big bottle of wine even though we did not tell him previously. My wife was so moved with the kind arrangements from Mr. Dong and all his team. By the end of the tour in Hanoi, he bought us a very delicious dinner at a very nice Quan Ngon restaurant under the French styles and dedicated a very precious lacquer painting about the countrysides of Vietnam. By the way, his tour guides in both Vietnam & Cambodia are also professional and speaking English well and knowledgable.Here is really our dream tour and once again thanks Mr. Dong for treating us like a King and Queen and surely we'll use this company again and tell my friends about Viet Long."

The advertised trip was 12 nights but we stayed an extra night in Siem Reap and another in Hanoi. We were slightly concerned before we booked as to whether we would be with a group of people (which we didn't want) but everything was arranged so we were on our own. Everything worked like clockwork with pick ups and hotels and all the guides were great. None of the hotels could be described as luxury but they were all safe, clean and well located. Some tips for you:Siem Reap - hire a car and driver rather than a guide to explore the Angkor complex. The tuks tuks looked fun but we really benefitted from an air conditioned car. My favourite temple was Banteay Srei which is around 35KM from Siem Reap; very small but beautiful and different to the other temples we visited.The bus journeys between Siem Reap and Phnom Pehn, and Phnom Pehn and Ho Chi Mihn City are long and uncomfortable. The roads are rough and its like spending 7 hours in a washing machine on spin cycle! although you just have to grin and bear it.Phnom Pehn - the sunset cruise on the river was fun (this was not part of the itinerary but we just picked up a leaflet in the hotel). The killing fields and S21 are harrowing but we felt that we had to visit them. Our guide was great. Ho Chi Mihn City - The Bitexco tower is well worth a visit. We went to the bar and had a beer whilst admiring the view of the city at night. The tour of the C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels was good, again, with a great guide.Halong City - not much to do here but it is just an overnight stay before the Halong Bay cruise. There was a swimming pool at the hotel which was good.Halong Bay Cruise - Brilliant!! So much packed into 24 hours, one of the highlights of the trip.Hanoi - Really enjoyed Hanoi, crazy but very atmospheric. Glad we spent an extra night here. I recommend visiting the Citadel and the underground bunkers which played a part during the American war.Overall a fantastic trip: great guides, hotels and well organised."

They were very flexible when we wanted to change details from the original package offered which was flying with Qatar Airways via Doha and just a day trip to Halong Bay. We wanted to fly direct with Vietnam Airlines and change the Halong Bay trip to an overnight cruise (highly recommended) and Citrus were happy to change this. Once in Vietnam we were looked after very well by Vietlong Travel and all of our transfers were well organised by the very helpful and friendly reps. If you are thinking of travelling to Vietnam then I would not hesitate to recommend Citrus and Vietlong Travel"

This was the first time we had traveled with Citrus Holidays/Vietlong Travel.The organisation of the travel and trips was excellent.We had a bit of a hiccup when about to leave Hoi An,the evening before we were notified by our guide,Oanh,that we would be flying to Hanoi instead of taking the train,as it would be mayhem on it owing to the Lunar New Year.We were a bit surprised at this,but however it meant we were staying an extra night in the city at no expense to us.All the trips were well organised,with any extra tickets being paid for in advance by Vietlong Travel.Even on the Halong Bay trip we were given a bottle of decent red wine with our meal,others had to pay for their drink.The only minor complaint we would have is,a bit more information from the guides when traveling to the destinations wouldn't go amiss,after all everything in this extremely interesting country was new to us.It was good to feel in safe hands when visiting Vietnam,and Citrus/Vietlong certainly made it a marvelous experience for us.Thank you!"

Had a great tour booked through Citrus and using VietLong Travel for guiding services - I think just in Vietnam as I`m not sure who did the Cambodian end. The guides were generally where they were meant to be to pick us up and showed us the sights giving local knowledge and stories to keep it interesting. The only negative was that we were initially told that we did not have a walking tour in Hanoi when it was clearly stated in our itinerary - even though not in the excursion list. I emailed Citrus and then we got a call later giving us a time for the tour as if it was never in doubt! What spoiled that tour was that it was on the 2nd day rather than the first as we`d expected then and it was quite a hike of a walking tour that would have been better as bus drop offs. That apart the guides were very good and we had a great time and I would recommend VietLong highly."

We had quite a complicated 14-night tour through Cambodia and Vietnam arranged by VietLong through Citrus Holidays - five flights, two buses, five hotels and a Halong Bay cruise. At every pick-up, we were met on time by helpful guides and drivers, even when one of our flights was delayed and both of the buses broke down en-route(!). Halong Bay was just wonderful - fantastic scenery, great food, and a captain and crew who made us feel really welcome. The captain was seen to help swab the decks, serve the food, and even took a great tai chi early-morning session. No class divisions on his boat! The hotels exceeded expectations - we particularly liked the Amaricus Hotel in Hanoi, where we felt truly cherished in a wonderful central location. All the arrangements within VietLong's control worked like clockwork, and overall we had a really memorable trip. Many thanks to all concerned."

It starts in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, includes a 1 hour flight to Luang Nam Tha, has an overnight stay in the Ban Khon Tan village (my favorite part), go to Udom Xai, Muang Khua, take a cruise down river to Nong Kiau, and eventually end in Luang Prabang. There are so many great photo opportunities and adventures to be had along the way. After the biking is done for the day, you will check into your hotel and the guide will recommend attractions for you to visit. The overnight stay in the Ban Khon Tan village is truly amazing. After lunch you will take a long wooden boat an hour down a river to the village. When you arrive the boatman will take you up to the family you stay with for the night. Everyone is very friendly and hospitable. Depending on the weather, you will either get a tour of the village or get better acquainted with the family hosting you. During your overnight stay, you will have opportunities to talk with the community (via the multi-lingual guide usually), eat home cooked meals, and tour the immediate area. Now this is the way to see the real Laos. It is important to stay open minded during this part of the tour especially. You will learn a lot. The tour guides during this trip are locals, so they are skilled in the multiple languages used along the way. Being that there are 49 main ethnic groups ethnic groups recognized by the Lao Government, being multi-lingual is essential for the guides. Have no fear though, as a tourist it is ok to just learn a few key words and phrases. Just showing that you will try will earn you respect among the locals. This is a biking tour, so I recommend trying to work out before your tour. I learned this the hard way. However, the guide will be understanding and will work in rest breaks along the way. The further you go South from Luang Nam Tha, the less mountainous the routes become. All that being said, it is a gorgeous area of the country and I highly recommend this trip."

We spent a fantastic three days in Cambodia the people the food the shopping the tour was all fantastic, we even went on an extra tour to the Koulen Mountain Waterfall, in the hills and swam in a pool below the waterfall( ask your guide its worth it).TheTemples at Angkor Wat are amazing.( dont worry about visas it takes 10 mins at the airport)We stayed in the Wooden Angkor Wat Hotel, the staff were charming and could not do enough for you, get your clothes washed and ironed here 2 dollars a kilo. Just use dollars whilst here it is accepted everywhere. I would also advise to buy gifts here as well.We the moved on to Phnom Penh , try to get a flight from Siem Reap as the roads on the bus journey are awful its not a great journey.The Palace was amazing you will get some amazing photos. The killing Fields were a real history lesson, and the prison were Pol pot tortured his victims is haunting. We stayed at the Silver River hotel( ask for a room at the front)We then took the bus across the border to Hoi Chi Min again all transfers went smooth (fly if you can). Once in Hoi Chi Min visited the Cu Chi tunnels which were amazing i even fired an ak47. We then visited the war museum again a real history lesson. We stayed at the Signature Saigon Hotel again ask for a room with a window, or a front facing room. we then flew to Hanoi, picked up at airport and taken straight to the Siagon Halong Hotel which was a great hotel, ask for a sea facing room and get up at 6.30am for the sunrise..Two days cruising Halong Bay worth the trip in itself.Coached back to Hanoi stayed at the Hanoi Meracus 1 hoteln very good hotel staff could not do enough for you ,just relaxed and enjoyed Hanoi shopping and markets very good. A Fantastic holiday worth every penny with amazing organisation ( Samarth at Citrus is excellent when booking) Thank you Citrus / Vietlong"

We booked with Citrus / Vietlong Travel and although initially wary (we prefer to make our arrangements, book own means of transport and just bumble about with a copy of the Lonely Planet) - we were overwhelmingly happy with how things went - especially as this was a trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary.From the moment we arrived we knew we were in good hands. Our arrival was not the smoothest as our flight from London was Cancelled - so delayed by a day - we even had to end up in the wrong city in Vietnam (no one's fault but the airline) - managed to get a connection- and eventually got to our start in Siem Reap. The emergency phone numbers worked perfectly. Both UK, Vietnam and Cambodian Agents were all kept informed as best as we could make them of the issues while dashing from airline desks to connecting flights. As we missed day one - our guide was kind enough to combine 2 days worth of tours into what would have been day 2... confused yet? Our 2 week tour covered Siem Reap - Phnom Penh - HCMC - Halong Bay - Hanoi.All hotels we stayed in were suitable for the 2 or 3 night stays. Our private cars were clean, and our drivers courteous and polite. The tours were good - and the advice given in between - places to see and eat when not with our guides was very welcome. Transfers all smooth - and it was nice for the guides and drivers to wait with us before we boarded local busses and flights - to check all was ok - and were on our way to the next destination. This was a great touch and made us feel looked after and secure.... even at 2:30am in the morning when our boat was caught in a huge storm in Halong Bay with the loudest thunder and the brightest lightning - everyone was calm - and everything continued as planned. All entry tickets for tours and transport were looked after by or provided by the guides just as our emails and itinerary from Citrus said they would be.Now the thing that made this tour and holiday the experience it was - is simply our guides in each place. Sol - Siem ReapKos - Phnom Penh Nick - HCMCQuinn - Hanoi - Halong Lech - Halong Bay Cruise Tran Loan - Hanoi (apologies if names spelt wrong) Each with their own style and personality. They knew what we wanted to know - and what we already knew - so no need for them to repeat themselves or bog us down with information overload. We had fun, laughed, chatted and discussed our lives in brief - but this is when you get to start to know a place - it's culture through it's people- over a coffee in a local coffee shop, or from hearing the experiences of our guide's parents during the Khmer Rouge - to the freedoms and restraints in today's society in both countries. These are the bits we will cherish - these fleeting but worthy encounters with those intrusted to make our visit a good one. English spoken, Smart both in appearance and intelligence - and able to deal with all of our ridiculous questions and my constant photographing or anything and everything.To echo others - Thank you for a wonderful holiday and experience from start to finish and will happily recommend you to friends and family that wish to travel to Cambodia or Vietnam. Thank you Vietlong Travel - Thank you :-)"

The organisation was faultless, all our guides excellent - extremely knowledgeable, friendly and helpful - and the hotels were great (even the Wooden Angkor in Siem Reap, which someone else criticised; while I agree it was definitely a bit 'rustic' by comparison with the other 4 hotels we stayed in, it was still charming, the food was good, the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the rooftop restaurant was a great place to gently begin each day).Siem Reap was a fascinating introduction to Cambodia and its temples were literally breathtaking - that day involved a lot of walking and clambering over ruins, but was probably my favourite part of the whole trip. The following day we also took an optional trip to a waterfall and temple in the mountains - again fascinating and the last 5 miles of the journey are definitely an experience - 'off-road' springs to mind as an apt description.The trip to the floating village was fascinating, but probably would have been even better if taken not right at the end of the dry-season!We tried a variety of great food in Siem Reap, from a street corner caf\u00e9 to one of the best meals of my life at Haven Training Restaurant (book in advance by email).Pub Street was somewhat seedy unless you are 30-something or younger, but don't miss out on the night markets nearby.Next came the journey on the Mekong Express coach to Phnom Penh - another experience not to be missed, very quirky and fun, great to watch the countryside unfold as you travel along for 7 hours, and I am assured they will finish the roadworks some time soon - maybe in five years. Watch out for the pit-stop with fried crickets and dried snails on sale!While we were in Phnom Penh there were royal birthday celebrations with a fantastic firework display. The tour of the royal palace and museums were fascinating, while the trip to the Security Prison 21 and the 'killing fields' memorial were incredibly moving.Next came another long coach journey to the Vietnamese border then on to Ho Chi Minh City, including the rather bemusing and long-winded process of actually crossing the border.HCMC is a hectic and bustling surprisingly (to me) modern city - with apparently 6 million motorcycles and I think we saw most of them. Plenty to see and do with of course lots of interesting history to soak up. We took a trip Cu Chi Tunnels used by the Viet Cong - unmissable and enthralling, including a chance to fire off a few rounds from an AK47 - definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience!We flew from HCMC to Hanoi, where we were picked up and whisked-off to Halong Bay for 2 days, including an excellent overnight boat cruise (reviewed elsewhere) which was well worth it.Back in Hanoi for our final few days, we stayed in a fantastic hotel (the Meracus) in the middle of the Old Quarter - on the street of shoe shops (every street in Hanoi seems to specialise in selling one product). The Old Quarter is buzzing, with a fantastic choice of bars and restaurants. Very easy to get around, but also easy to get slightly lost. An optional guided group tour of the city was fascinating and definitely worth doing- even the slightly nerve-wracking cyclo-tour in the middle of all the frantic traffic!We also took a day excursion out to the '3 caves' river trip - fantastic scenery, but a rather hot and long day.On the last day we toured the city on foot, including the French Quarter, then we were picked-up and driven to the airport for our flight home.Overall an absolutely fascinating trip, a tremendous variety of experiences, somewhat hectic but very well organised. The tour guides absolutely made the experience, with all the extra bits of information they were able to add. Not a trip for those expecting absolute luxury, but certainly one of the most interesting and enjoyable holidays we have had.the only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that some of the excursions should definitely be included as standard - even though this would increase the base price of the holiday, it would have been much less of an experience with those 'extras'."

The standard of hotels throughout our stay was very good and the locations were great; the whole trip had been thoughtfully organised.

Would definitely recommend to anyone considering booking through this company."

            "review": "Motorcycle Tour of Vietnam. I planned a 2 week tour of Vietnam for 6 friends from the United States through Vietlong Tours and specifically Mr Dong. He was very accommodating with all questions, answering emails promptly. Our tour was comprised of a Mekong Delta tour followed by an 8 day motorbike ride north from Ho Chi Minh City up to Hue. We then took an overnight train from Hue to Hanoi - which I would not recommend to anyone. The train was filthy and had many cockroaches in our first class sleeper cabin (if I was to do it again, I'd fly). We then had a tour of Hanoi, then our vacation ended with a two day Halong Bay cruise. Our guide for this journey was Mr Chung who was excellent, spoke good English and fit in well with our group. He allowed us to amend out tour on the fly and gave us great recommendations on sight seeing and restaurants. He was also able to procure a new scooter when one of ours died on the second day of the trip. On the down side, some of the 3 star hotels we chose were a bit tired, though still clean. If we did it again, we may have chosen 4 star properties. Also, we were told all the motorbikes (we had 5 motorcycles and 1 scooter) would be somewhat new. Unfortunately, only one out of six were new - the others were quite old and as stated above it died on day two. Luckily in addition to the guide, we hired a support truck and mechanic. In addition to ferrying our luggage for the motorbike portion of the trip, they tossed the dead scooter in the back of the truck! Overall, was a fantastic adventure and would do it again in a heartbeat."

Just returned from doing the 2 week tour of Cambodia and Vietnam thru Citrus holidays organised by Vietlong travel - seen on Travelzoo who are excellent. The holiday went like clockwork, guides and cars turned up on time, buses were efficient. Guides were knowledgable and spoke good english. Hotel apart from one were very good standard with hearty breakfasts. Managed to get a good feel for both countries and saw some delightful things and others harrowing. I felt the Angkor wooden hotel let down the stay in Siem Reap. Perhaps we were just unlucky? our room was dirty,towels threadbare and the rooftop where we ate breakfast was sparse and up 4 flights of stairs. After trekking round temples in 35 degrees of heat and dust a hotel with a pool would have been great. I know Vietlong travel have spoken to the hotel and sent our photos of the room as evidence so maybe it will improve? Our boat on the Halong Bay trip was not of the Royal Heritage line but it was okay when we got aboard and the staff and food were great. Very foggy on the trip to monkey island but on our return the sun came out and everyone sat on the deck. Good all round holiday and Vietlong will cater to individual needs if you want to organise your own trip."

Some of the road transfers were a bit tedious, but this was as much due to the state of the roads and traffic as it was to the distances covered. The Mekong Express buses used for the transfers between Siem Reap, Phnom Penh and Saigon were not up to the standard of the hotels chosen. Alternative transport arrangements may have made things much better. Overall it was an excellent introduction to the area."

Finally Mr.Dong gave us a very reasonable price and we had no change to refuse his special proposal. They booked most hotels for our stay with very good locations, helpful staff and excellent services. We found it convenient to walk around in every city. Accordingly, their informative and experienced tour guides generally have a very good communication skill in English and we understood completely on tour. we have no complaint for other services such as transportation with good driver and punctual pick-ups, we surely enjoyed our trip and will continue traveling with Viet Long travel again in our next holidays.

Booked a two week tour through Citrus Holidays in the UK, but all arrangement when in Cambodia and Vietnam were sorted by Vietlong.Quite frankly, we were bowled over from start to finish, the itinerary is jam-packed but it was an entirely stress free trip. Vietlong ensured all airport meetings and transfers were seamless; private travel arrangements and guides were of a high standard. We began our trip in Siem Reap, and travelled also to Phnom Penh, Ho Chi Minh, Halong and Hanoi. All guides were knowledgeable and personable people who were easy to get along with and made our experience on each excursion a bespoke one.There are two things which puts this tour company above any that I have used in any part of the world; firstly, having met Mr Dong at the end of our travels, the company certainly use Tripadvisor and listen to travellers' needs and wishes expressed through that medium. For example, every hotel was in a great location and many of them within the top 10 of their respective Tripadvisor rankings. Two of the hotels had won recent Travellers' Choice Awards.The second aspect which should be praised is that the customer experience is absolutely paramount. It is fair to say we had to change some of our arrangements at the last minute, resulting in the cancellation of a couple of excursions/transfers. Instead of pocketing the remuneration the company received from this, and without even making a request, Vietlong used the extra money to upgrade our Halong Bay cruise, add a further excursion on, and also inform many hotels of my upcoming birthday without me informing them of this!I cannot recommend Vietlong highly enough, we were impressed with our itinerary and all aspects of the service. Now that I have read other reviews on here, it is very clear that they listen carefully and respond immediately."

VietLong Travel Day Tours was suggested to me by my local friend The Anh, who highly recommended this tour as one of the best, and he was right! The Travel bus picked me up promptly at the designated time, right at the front door of my hotel. I was greeted with Good Morning and a smile and we were on our way. We picked up a few other passengers from other hotels, the whole process was quick and efficient. The Travel bus is air conditioned with comfortable seating, making the 4 hour+ trip to Halong Bay a comfortable one. The Bus also has huge unobstructed windows so you have great views, allowing for perfect picture taking opportunities. About half way you stop for a 30 minute rest, at a place where they carve statues, and food and refreshments are offered for a small fee. Very interesting rest stop, and a pleasant place to sit in the shade and stretch your legs while admiring the beauty of the statues, hundreds of them are spread out over the entire grounds. Along the way to Halong Bay you drive through some very remote areas, small towns, and plenty of scenic grandiosity abounds all around you, have your camera ready. Arriving in Halong Bay you aare escorted from your bus to the docks where all the Halong Bay boats are located. The VietLong boat is impressive, very large, well maintained and employing a friendly staff who see to your every need. The upper deck has lounge chairs to allow you to bask in the sunshine while cruising the islands. Belowe is the dining area, tables \"booth\" style with comfortable seating. You are served a very tasty seafood lunch, and beverages are available for purchase. Cruising the Bay is beautiful aboard this boat, solowly through the massive channels where cliffs loom all around.  Then you head to through one particular alcove which leads you to The Caves, the boat docks at the pier and you are led up a somewhat steep stairway, mountainside where you finally enter the Caves...get your cameras out for this..it is simply spectacular. After about 45 minutes in the Caves you are led out again, down to your boat, and set off once again through the glorious mazes of islands and eventually leading you back to your original starting point.  An incredible experience from start to finish, I highly recommend VietLong Travel Day Tours as your choice for top-notch enjoyment, safety, good food, and fabulous times, you can't go wrong with VietLong!"

The food served were aplenty and nice! Tour guide on board is very approachable. Having said all the good stuff, the prices for the drinks on board are on the high side though. But all in all, it was a wonderful trip with many great memories.Oh, and I am not sure how did they know about it, we were presented with a bottle of red wine and a cake with sparkles for the night - our anniversary!! Thank you!!Please keep up the good work and I am sure you will go a long way!!"

            "review": "12-day VIETNAM - CAMBODIA TOUR WITH WONDERS. We booked a tour online with Vietlong travel for our vacation this May. Agent was attentive and accommodating even before we got to Vietnam. They made sure we had our plane tickets, invoice and itinerary. We were generally happy with the tour package however there were some minor inconveniences. Upon our airport arrival, the guide was nowhere to be found. He probably misunderstood our arrival time which was around midnite (0030 hrs) and thought that it was lunch time (12.30pm). It's a good thing we had the guide's contact number so we called him up and someone picked us up from the airport and brought us to the hotel. And since it was a midnite arrival, we were not advised to book a room that's exclusive from the package as our tour started the next day. Luckily, we were able to book a room at a discount. The guide and travel agent were very apologetic although a discount would have been preferred as compensation :) From thereon, the tour went smoothly. From our transfer to hanoi-halong bay up to cambodia - everything was good. Our tour guides, Minh from Hue and Narin from Cambodia were very informative and very nice. Always arriving on time and knows their job well. It was a fun trip as we had the chance to ride a cyclo (vietnamese tricycle), a junk, a motorbike, boats, night train and go kayaking all in one trip. In summary, it was a good trip. I would recommend this for travellers who want an \"almost hassle-free\" trip...check out their itinerary... the tour includes around 4 world heritage sites - i love phong nha caves and hoi an and siem reap! You can probably arrange for a cheaper package if you plan it yourself, but i think it's a good buy if you just want to enjoy a relaxing trip without the hassles of planning."

It was suggested by friends that we should book any tours we wanted to do when we arrived in Vietnam. So whilst staying in our Hotel in Hanoi,(Golden Wings 2), with the help of one of the friendly staff (Steven) we organized a trip to Halong bay and one to Sapa. (Steven is originally from Sapa, so had local knowledge). After looking thru a couple of book/brochures, we chose which boat we wanted to stay on. Steven organised all the rest. We were picked up from our Hotel for both tours and all the connections were smooth easy and friendly. On both our tours we met and made friends with other travellers, and it sounded like our \"organisation\" was alot more thorough than some others. Some of our new found friends were left at the train station to fend for themselves at the end of their trip, whilst we were met by a member of our hotel staff, even tho' it was 6:30am and still dark. The trips were both reasonably priced and at the end of them both we were so glad we had chosen to go both to Sapa and to Halong Bay. On our cruise the staff were all great and our guide 'TAM' was so nice and they made the night fun, joining in on the karaoke evening and cooking class. Our local guide in Sapa 'Lala' was really sweet and lots of fun also. All the meals were delicious and plentiful. The train ride was a hoot!! All in all I have No hesitations in recommending this firm to everyone. Do it, you'll have a blast!! Oh and of course the scenery and local people of Sapa and Halong Bay were AMAZING!!"

The reasons I still choose Heritage Cruise are because the price suits my budget and I had experienced no big trouble during my first trip with Heritage. You will see some users reviewing how excellent, while others reviewing how worst the cruise or the crew were. I can only say that, it depends on the person him/herself. Personally, I can say that I enjoyed my trip, and I'd only give neutral opinions about the trip.Since I have no high expectation of how luxurious the cruise would be (please do remember the price you pay for the tour), I was satisfied using Heritage Cruise and Vietlong travel as the agent. Trouble might happened on the cruise, or you met some passengers who didn't want to mingle with others, but it's not a big deal at all and the main point is I still had the fun enjoying the beauty of Halong bay and Catba island. Again my thank you to Ms. Thai Ha as the marketing of Vietlong and to all the guides in Halong and Sapa. It's a pleasure for me to use their service."

Our flights were trouble free, the guides chosen by Vietlong Travel were very good, our quiet time in hotels also provided by Vietlong Travel were just right for our needs. The food was teriffic and especially the cooking class in Hoi An. A group of international students and much conversation at our lunch we cooked ourselves.

Each of us were on the back of either motorbike or scooter riding through the busy streets, experiencing the wonderful life and views of the City.We stopped at various eating places to have 'more than you can eat' local food and drinks including street food which was simply delicious. My husband and our friend who generally choose 'burger and chips' type of food, tried and enjoyed all the food we tried.We were able to see and ride along areas we would otherwise not have the opportunity to see. Riding across the famous Long Bien bridge was the highlight of this tour for me.The riders were brilliant. They are so skilled and at no time made me feel anxious of being on a bike in a busy city.We returned to our hotel by 10. 30 pm having had an exhilarating evening of fun."

Here it goes:When my friends and I travel we never like to do tours. We typically like to experience the culture on our own terms. I was skeptical when a friend recommended this tour but I went along with it. We booked this tour from the States and Frank was very responsive and able to answer all of our questions which was very reassuring. When we arrived at the airport Frank was there to greet us and take us to our hotels. We all instantly connected like we all had been friends forever. One the ride he was for informative, educating us on the culture of Vietnam. Once we were ready to go we were picked up on the motorbikes which was cool because its the preferred method of transportation for the locals. We were whisked around town eating amazing food, site seeing and getting to see Hanoi through a local eyes. It was a great trip.We were soo impressed that we decided to ask Frank to be our tour guide to Sapa. Frank set everything up which was a stress relief for us. We were taken to a market 2 hours away rarely seen by tourists. We were able to participate in mission work with a Hmong village in the mountains. Everything was just Perfect. I cannot forget the amazing team that accompanied us. Ellie (Thao), Mickey (Ngoc), Hanna, and Moon. These girls were just soo amazing. We pretty much laughed the whole trip. I felt like I have known these girls for years. I was amazed to see how selfless they were while we were on the mission trip. I remember when I child had no shoes or socks. Micky took off her own socks and gave them to the child. I wanted to cry. We trekked 3 kilometers on the mountain in the rain and no one complained. It was the highlight of my trip and I could not see myself going through it with any other team. I highly recommend this tour!!!"

Had experiences that many would love to have but none of my past experiences can compare with what I had in Vietnam and it's all because of Frank. From the minute I touchdown'ed in Hanoi til I left for Thailand, me and my friends were treated like first class celebrities. We were picked up by a really nice SUV. Greeted by Frank and his team like we've been friends even family for years! As soon as we were in the car, Frank was very informative. He told us our itinerary. Gave us time to settle in our hotel, which he set up. I felt so at ease. Just like a vacation should feel. I knew right away that I could trust Frank with the rest of my travels there. Once we settled in our hotel, we were picked up in scooters and motorbikes by 4 really beautiful and intelligent travel guides. So informative and nice. They drove us around the city, giving us historical information along the way. We then had egg coffee which was amazing and special only to Hanoi. Drove around some more. Had dinner at an amazing place. All picked your by Frank and his team at vietnam Motorbikes Rides. Unbelievable experience. Frank then set up the rest of our trip. Took care of our accommodations. Our train tickets and travel to Halong Bay, Sapa and back to Hanoi. Took us to all the best places to eat and site see. I feel like I can rift a book just on my adventures with Frank. And unforgettable experience traveling in Vietnam. He needs his own travel show. He's also super generous. We decided to go to Sapa and hike up a mountain to give presents to the San 2 Village with underprivileged Hmong people. What an experience. It was tough trekking the mountain in the rain and cold but it was worth it. Frank and his team got us up there safely. I will post photos from that part of the trip as well. I didn't want to leave Hanoi/Vietnam because I didn't think I would get special treatment like I received with Frank and his team. Money wasn't an issue. Frank took care of everything and kept tabs of the bill and would charge you later. He didn't even want any tip or anything. He just didn't want you to worry about paying during the experience and he got the best deals throughout our travels. Frank knew just about everyone in the cities we went too and they all gave him special prices and great deals. I already told all my friends about Frank. I myself am planning to come back to Vietnam and you better believe Frank is the first person I'm calling. Me and my friends called Frank our little brother. He went above and beyond my expectations. So much I wrote a review. I never right a review but I feel like this one needed to be written. Thank you to Frank and his team for giving me and my friends such a memorable experience in Vietnam - Hanoi, Halong Bay and Sapa. You are a friend for life and I'm glad we crossed paths. Thank you for making me feel special and experience the true meaning of traveling, backpacking and living life."

It was clear that he had researched all the places we stayed in advance and showed me many things along the way that were very special and unique.

Frank was able to upgrade our hotel,cruise train car versus what we would have paid anyway. He was sensitive to my inability to eat seafood and made sure at every restaurant we went to that we had the best (even sending things back when the freshness wasn't up to his standards). Lastly I cant say enough about Frank's positive mentality and warmness - he is the kind of person you meet for 5 minutes and you immediately would feel safe letting your kids stay with. I hope others have the opportunity to meet frank and enjoy his services. I highly recommend!!"

There was never a dull moment with them. It's interesting to hear about their personal stories and about Vietnam history and culture. And not forgetting the countless wefie we took together! I'm really glad that I managed to sign up for this day-long tour in exploring the scenic countryside and visiting places which I would otherwise not have been able to. We went to several temples and pagodas, had delicious sticky corns and drinks along the road (see picture), was warmly welcomed with a savoury lunch at Frank's relatives, toured the ancient village of Duong Lam and tried some local snacks at one of the remaining historical homes. Overall, it was a truly fun-filled day with Frank and Elly. What a great trip through the countryside and a chance to experience a rural lifestyle. Definitely a wonderful experience raw and real! Get out there, see the world through the eyes of the locals. Thanks Frank and Elly for such a wonderful time together!"

We spent the next day visiting various sites in and around Hanoi with Frank and Elley, one of his top guides. We saw and did far more in that one day than in the other two-and-a-half. Both Frank and Elley speak excellent English and were extremely knowledgeable about the city, the country and their history. They steered us to restaurants and sights that we would never have found on our own and explained the ways of Hanoi and its people with great humor and insight. Being on a motorbike allowed us to see a lot in a short period of time. And slipping in and out of the river of motorbikes that pulses through the city made us feel much more a part of its life. Thanks Frank and Elley!"

It really wasn\u2019t an issue when following him from behind. For the two days we were on the tour I saw some of the most beautiful countryside and interesting goings on I have ever came across. It is truly stunning and something to rival anything in the world. In regards to seeing the local life in Vietnam, Frank showed us that. Small fishermen catching fish almost by hand, watermelon farmers, locals in the rice fields. It all felt authentic and real. It wasn\u2019t a show. Frank showed us how these people were really living. He\u2019s an excellent tour guide and this is something you can tell he\u2019s genuinely passionate about.The place we stayed couldn\u2019t be faulted; nor the food; nor the people who were there.

I didn't however ride my own motorbike because I didn't feel comfortable enough with my riding skills, especially since I've never been on a semi automatic bike where the brake is by the foot. Nonetheless, Frank was very helpful, so initially when I wanted to try riding a motorbike, Frank picked me up at my hostel and we went to an area closeby so that I could practice. I decided after riding for a bit that I'm not confident enough, so instead I went on a country side tour of Hanoi with Frank, while sitting at the back of Frank's bike. I had a really lovely time. We went to visit a pagoda, and although we didn't get to spend too much time there due to time, it was still a nice and peaceful place to visit. We then rode to another village and ate some delicious local food. I enjoyed my experience of riding with Frank because he's such an awesome person, and I really believe that experiences are so memorable and wonderful when shared with others (although I have great experiences while being on my own too haha). I went on two other tours with Frank - the street food tour, where I was stuffed and stuffed until I had a food baby! But my goodness the food was so delicious, and I definitely would not have eaten the food I ate if it weren't for the tour. Locals always know the awesome local food. And I also went on a Hanoi city tour which was nice because I saw more of the city centre, and it's just faster to see everything via motorbike. Plus I was riding behind Frank, so I didn't have to worry about the traffic or watch out for cars, people, bikes, etc so I felt relaxed and could enjoy the views of the city. I would highly recommend one or more of the many tours Frank and his company offers! There is a lot of professionalism, and I was treated like family :). Thank you so much for making my time in Hanoi very enjoyable!!"

We met the previous day for an hour practice, as I wasn't the most confident of riders, but Mr Frank was extremely supportive and made sure that I was comfortable before our day's ride - I didn't feel pressured to do anything I didn't want to do. Mr Frank gave us helmets and knee/elbow pads and gloves, so we felt pretty well kitted out. I would recommend wearing long sleeves/trousers as well as it can get a bit cool on the bike in the wind.On the day itself, we set off early at about 7.30am to try to miss the traffic. Hanoi may seem chaotic, but actually I never felt like it was dangerous - everyone is driving quite slowly and watching out for one another. We set off into the countryside to look at some stunning pagodas - it felt like we were really heading off the beaten path. Just driving along countryside paths was a huge part of the experience.We really appreciated the frequent stops we made during the day - stopping at places we would just never have stopped at! Mr Frank gave us lots of different types of Vietnamese food and snacks to try, which just added to the experience. We had a superb lunch with his relatives in a small town, and he was a real pleasure to talk to. We felt like good friends after our trip!!All in all, it was a fantastic day and a real highlight. I think it'll be one of those days that I look back on and go \"wow, I went motorbiking in Vietnam!\". It was fantastic as well that Mr Frank acted as our own photographer on the day - we didn't take any valuables out with us, so to have photos for the memories is really special. Thank you Mr Frank!"

This experience, which was brilliantly led by our tour guide Frank, was the most amazing and authentic experience I've had of all of my travels to Asia (and I\u2019ve been to 8 countries during my Southeast Asia travels this year).One of the great wonders about Vietnam (specifically Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh) is the organized chaos of motorbikes in the bustling city. If you want to truly experience either one of these cities, you absolutely have to see it from the perspective of a motorbike - whether you ride it yourself or are a passenger on the back. I learned this by taking a \"back of the bike\" tour during my first part of the Vietnam travels in Ho Chi Minh city (HCMC). After HCMC, my brother and I flew to Hanoi. I did not plan much with the exception of Halong Bay and a tour around the city with Hanoi Free Tours (both experiences were great btw). Frank was the receptionist at our hotel (Oriental Central hotel \u2013 highly recommended) upon arriving in Hanoi. Frank spoke very good English and taught us all of the things we needed to know to have a safe trip in Hanoi, which is crucial info to get if it is your first visit. We told Frank how much we enjoyed riding on the back of the motorbikes in HCMC, which is when he informed us of his Vietnam Motorbike Rides business.I was pretty hesitant of the idea at first because I had never ridden a scooter, let alone a motorcycle, in my entire life. Riding on the back as a passenger is one thing, but then to think of the streets of Hanoi as my first time learning experience all seemed a bit crazy. But Frank assured us that he had confidence and that he would teach us everything we needed to know.So we decided to be adventurous and give it a try and do the \"Traditional Motorcycle Rides\" tour with Frank. We met Frank at his mechanic shop where he introduced us to his lovely family. From there he showed us how the motorbikes worked. They turned out to be extremely easy to ride, as they are automatic and soft on the acceleration. Frank also had other bikes to choose from (manual 150cc, 250cc, etc.), however we obviously weren\u2019t experienced enough to ride those. As soon as we entered the streets on our bikes a rush of adrenaline hit, as we were now part of the chaos. I suddenly grew an appreciation for the honking horns, as bikers are just letting you know that they are coming from behind. Everyone just seems to go with the flow and naturally avoid each other. Even as pedestrians cross the streets, you quickly understand why you should always walk straight and never stop when crossing the streets of Hanoi \u2013 bikers are depending on you to keep walking so they can slow down and/or maneuver around you. We always kept at a slow pace with everyone else on the streets and Frank guided us every step of the way. Its such a reassuring feeling once you realize just how easy and natural it is to ride the streets.Once we got comfortable with riding, we left central Hanoi and went over Long Bien bridge, at which point we pulled to the side to take in the amazing views. We then drove through the countryside until we arrived at Tu Dinh church. This was in a very nice little village, much different than what we had been used to seeing in the more touristy areas of Vietnam. We then rode to Bat Trang, which is a pottery village and finished our trip with the red river Song Hong. Once we got back to Hanoi, we returned our bikes to the shop then Frank took us out for some beers and very nice street food.I can\u2019t recommend this activity enough. If you love motorcycles, he has some pretty sweet choices for you. If you\u2019ve never ridden in your life, he has the tamed scooter bikes that are super easy to learn and ride. I promise you it will be an unforgettable experience, and I can\u2019t imagine a better way to see the real side of Vietnam."

I felt it was important to write my first review to acknowledge Frank and company at Vietnam Motorbike Rides for the wonderful service and hospitality that me and my travel buddies received this past weekend during our short trip to Hanoi, Vietnam. I was referred to Frank through one of my friends who had the pleasure of experiencing one of Frank's motorbike tours a few weeks before me and said that it was a MUST DO activity for my upcoming trip to Hanoi. Being extremely busy in work and my personal life, I didn't have a whole lot of time to research and plan my own itinerary for this trip other than the fact that I knew we wanted to do a motorbike tour and experience as much of Hanoi as we could in the short weekend trip we had planned. I contacted Frank a few days before our trip and must say that I was very impressed with his level of professionalism, quick follow ups, and more importantly, instantly felt a sense of \"trust\" with him. Frank put together an itinerary for us that consisted of pickup / transfer to and from the airport, a Friday evening motorbike tour of Hanoi city, and a full day countryside motorbike tour on Saturday.I\u2019ve never ridden a motorbike before and Frank and company made us feel very safe and comfortable with the instructions, ongoing supervision, and practice sessions that they had us do before attempting to move on to the actual streets of Hanoi city.

As we arrived in Hanoi, the only thing we had in mind, my boyfriend and I, was to do a motorbike tour in north Vietnam to meet the minority ethnics and have a real look of Vietnam.After one day of intense research, we had though to totally drop the idea because all the companies we went to offered prices too expensive for our budget or without any guide.Our randomly getting the number of Frank Hoang (through friends who had just returned from a trip with him) was our greatest luck!We called him, with no particular hopes because we didn't have much time left to organize our tour, and he immediately set up a meeting to present us his offer: not only the tour he offered was exactly what we had in mind, the prices very generous and reaching completely our budget, but also he could organize it so quickly that after only one day of training with the bike (not mentioning the meals he generously offered us), we were off to a 7-day private tour with a guide in north west vietnam. The prestations of the tour included two motorbikes, all of our meals, the nights in home stay or hotels and the competence and carefulness of our guide.We first went to Mai Chau, a lovely village with spectacular views of rice fields, where we stayed in a home stay, meaning sleeping and eating local food at Vietnamese's house.On the second day, we headed to son la, riding through the beautiful landscape of mountains, regularly stopping to take pictures and visiting interesting history places on the way. On day three, we rode to Dien Bien Phu where we enjoyed a wonderful familial meal at a Frank's relative's house.Day four, we went to Lai Chau, taking a bath in a river on the way, crossing bamboo bridges and having a drink at an old vietnamese veteran's house.On the fifth day, we headed to Sapa, where we arrived very soon to have the possibility of visiting the city and several beautiful rice fields, talking and walking with the inhabitants of several small villages.Day sixth, we headed to Thac Ba, enjoying an adventurous \"off road\" ride through the jungle. There, we went on a boat trip around the lake and enjoyed the hospitality of a vietnamese homestay with great food.On day seventh, we headed back to Hanoi, having time to stop on the road to further take pictures, visit some beautiful localities, and enjoy a last local meal with our guide.Frank didn't just left us there after the ride: not only he welcomed us in his home to have a shower, pack our stuff and eat a great meal cooked by his wife, but he also offered us the taxi to Hanoi's airport where we had to take a plane back to Ho Chi Minh city.As a resume, we could say that we went to a life time experience tour, meeting the beauty, kindness and generosity of Vietnam, accompanied by Frank, a very competent, careful guide speaking perfectly english and who offered us the best experience we had in Vietnam."

They arranged another guide for me to catch up with the group in a different place. That was really nice of them and a good way of thinking in solutions. We did the tour to SaPa and got back to Hanoi by night train, really good arrangement. They put the bike on the train also, and you can drive the bikes back once your back in Hanoi.We joined the group and had a wonderful time. Everything, and I really mean everything, is included! I got a motorbike jacket, pants, helmet etc. Included. So you don't have to bring your own gears.Further the accommodations are really nice should you want an overnight trip. Hotels, home stays all perfectly clean and nice. All foods and drinks were also surprisingly included, what a service/deal!Frank Luong did also some video capturing with his go pro hero camera. Awesome footage! And he does this while driving and hooding the camera holding in one hand and steering with the other, where I really needed to get a grip on my bike, haha he's a pro.I highly recommend to book with Vietnam Motorbike Rides Tours. Thanks Frank, Laura and Graham"

From the moment you contact Frank to the time you part ways, the staff of Vietnam motorbike tours strive to ensure you have the most memorable and positive experience possible. Over the two day private country side tour I did with Frank, I was able to experience what life is truly like for the people of rural vietnam. Not only did he encourage interaction with the local people but also invited me to stay with his family at their coutry farm and to share dinner with them. In my two months travelling south east asia I have yet to have a tour as authentic as what vietnam motorbike tours was able to provide. No matter what your budget, timeline or interests are, Vietnam motorbike tours will ensure your complete satisfaction. If you are at ALL considering doing a bike tour (on scooter or bike, on your own bike or on a guides) I strongly reccomend talking to the staff at vietnam motorbike tours. They are an amazing group of people who treat their customers with the utmost respect and kindness."

The tour was designed just for me, with my time constraints in mind. I had never been on a motorbike, so mine was semi-automatic and very easy to handle. We saw such a wide variety of terrain and sights, making the trip truly memorable. Hikes up beautiful mountains to serene temples, rides through roads surrounded by jungle, stops in carefully selected local establishments for refreshments and delicious meals.I highly recommend Vietnam Motorbike Rides Tours."

I saw sights that would have been impossible without the expertise of our guide, Frank. The journey itself was exciting, but the fact that we were with a local the whole time who know the route, where to sleep, the best places to eat, and history about the area made it a very enriching experience. Frank quickly became a wonderful friend and we gained an immediate trust with him as we ventured out into the countryside. Truly a beautiful experience. My boyfriend and I couldn't have asked for a better trip!"

We started in the agency and we visited the opera, the Eiffel Bridge, the west lake, an American plane destroyed during the war, the mausoleum and the citadel. What more can I say, in one your we visited all the important places in the city and we felt how Hanoi people do their life each day. The guide, Mr Hoang, is the kindest person we met in Hanoi, he also speak Spanish perfectly! He made us to feel not so far from home. If you are visiting Hanoi, this tour is a must."

Taking a vespa enables you to see the city in an authentic way, like one of the many many locals. Additionally, the tour guide was able to inform us about Hanoi's history, he drove us to special places we asked for and he helped us when bargaining for some shopping items. With the Vespas we drove on top of cool bridges crossing the red river, we saw the governmental part of Hanoi, explored the west lake and its temple. Overall we really recommend the tour and we thank Vintage Vespa tours for a cool afternoon. :)"

For those of you who've seen the traffic in Hanoi, you know how scary it was to two 60 year old Americans to hop on the back of a Vespa Scooter, and go of on a search for Vietnamese street food. Khanh Vu was our tour guide, and did the most amazing job with the traffic, the scenery, the discussion and the food. It was the perfect way to end our trip. Thanks, Hanoi Vintage Vespa Tours!"

We had seen what driving in Vietnam is like and thought it could be a bit dangerous. We decided we would go anyhow and we were all glad we did. The drivers were very safe and we had a thrill of a lifetime. We went to places we would have never gone on our own. The small nightclub with singers was very romantic. Don't order any other drinks but beer as the wine is terrible and mixed drinks are not drinkable."

We felt completely safe in Khanh and Le's , the other driver, hands despite the chaos that is hanoi's roads. They catered to our wants and interests and we highly enjoyed the whole experience.

Definitely a great experience winding around the streets and roads of Hanoi on the back of these! Felt very safe the entire time if anyone was nervous, I wouldn't be. The lunch was some of the best food that we had while visiting Hanoi. It was so so tasty and we left feeling faaarrrrr too full purely cause we couldn't stop eating!

Our team was really nice and our guide very knowledgable. The Vespas are quite old and we had couple that broke up, that's understandable. However the guys are well organised, had one extra driver on the tour and the guide on his motorcycle, so they just took over when needed and we did not loose any tour time. Overall the experience was really fun, the streets of Hanoi are a total driving chaos and being part of it was a bit scary at first. But the vespa drivers manage it well somehow and after few chaotic crossings you just get used to it. Highly recommended."

On the other hand food at lunch was so good we asked for the card of the small local restaurant in the Old Quarter (big plus). I always enjoy the vignettes of SE Asian living: shaving bamboo, scalding de-feathered rooster, cooking over a brazier, but there was not a lot of value-add this afternoon. We did enjoy it but they certainly could lift their game."

The short tour (around 2h) goes to the dragon bridge, French quarter, Ho Chi Minh mausoleum and some temple. Anyway Khan told us about Hanoi's history...

My girlfriend and I were wandering around Hanoi on a hot day unsure of how to spend our afternoon when we stumbled upon this flyer in our hotel lobby. It seemed like it was the only afternoon tour that was more than just the city of Hanoi so we decided to give it a try thinking it was just an opportunity to ride vespas around the countryside. We were picked up by two well dressed tour guides from our hotel and hopped on the back of two vespas unsure of what was planned. They immediately whisked us outside of the city deftly and safely driving us side by side with the rest of the good people of Vietnam. (They drove slower and far safer than the other drivers of Hanoi, so need to worry at all about safety). They took us to five separate stops along the way in the area outside of the city, (all of great importance in Vietnamese history/culture) giving us expert guidance and information. One of the best parts of the tour was once we left hanoi's old quarter, I did not see one other tourist the entire time. It was a pleasure to travel and see important sites and be in the company of real locals who were slightly amazed and surprised by our presence. One highlight was sitting under the shade of Co Loa, the ancient citadel and capital/king's palace, with a group of five Vietnamese women eating freshly picked and cut jackfruit, and talking with them through our guide's translating skills about anything and everything you could imagine. This was a purely spontaneous happy coincidence and was an experience worth much more than the reasonable fee charged by the tour guide. Our tour guide was also fantastic and is a true relatable person (not just someone that talks at you) and we learned about his life and exciting new tour guiding business. He is an extremely smart and hard working, young new business owner who has put together the perfect travel experience. It was honestly the best tour I've had in my life and I've been on many tours in many countries that charge much more and offer far less. It is the only tour I've experienced that removes the awkward \"outsider looking in\" perspective that one usually encounters while traveling. I am excited for the future of the company (and tour guide) because it is on the verge of tremendous success - there is a reason everyone rates this five stars and writes a review. FYI this is the first and probably only review I will ever write because I feel that strongly about my experience. Do yourself a favor and do this tour before you do anything else in Hanoi!"

His english is fantastic and he explained in great detail all the historical buildings and landmarks around the city. Driving on the back of his Vespa was mental but so much fun, the traffic here is crazy!! I would so recommend building this two hour tour into your day it's a fun way to see the highlights of Hanoi and talking to Kanay has given us so many great ideas of other places to go and visit. The service was so friendly."

My son, which is celebrating 20th birthday, and myself enjoyed it very much. It was excellent and the lunch at the little hanoi restaurant could not be any better. It was a tasty local food representation. You guys were very professional and nice. Villages stops for water and corncobs were very good options. It is something different from the typical city tour. Going to countryside is real sightseeing adventure. Keep it up. Truly recommend it."

I was anxious to drive myself so I decided I don't have to do anything but sipping coconut juice behind at one of our tour guide's motorbike. I brought a traveller's mug with me and I was pleased. Unfortunately I was very ill at mid-day (due to a night before) I could not complete my venture but Vespa Tour dropped me off back to our hotel and they had carried on the tour without me. At the end of the tour when everyone returns back Vespa Tours sent me a message making sure I was alright. Very professional. Thank you!"

The vespas are from 1962. It is an amazing experience zipping through the tiny streets of the old quarter and around the city . it is hyper real at times being so close to everything , smelling everything . we saw lots of sights. the guides were brilliant ,very open and informative.The drivers were very good and safe and I felt safe at all times .

We decided to do the vintage Vespa tour in the evening time. The first thing you will notice in Hanoi is the melee of scooters buzzing about- so why not be a part of the madness! Kan, our guide showed us many sites in a span of 4,5 hours. He shared a lot of information about the monuments and attractions. We saw the opera house, dragon tail bridge, a long stretch of ceramic wall art, a gorgeous sunset at the west side lake- the largest in Hanoi, pagoda, Ho Chi Minh mausoleum, French district, and rode through the markets in the old district.

Upon learning about the company, I asked if I was possible that they follow the itinerary that I prepared for Hanoi. They had no objections and 30 minutes later we were already going around Hanoi. I had my own tour guide and photographer in all the sites that I personally wanted to go to while my driver with the others vespa waited for our at the entrances. I even went tho the Bun Cha restaurant where President Obama and Anthony Bourdain ate and my guide was very much willing to accompany me there. I even has egg coffee at Cafe Giang with my guide. I was able to visit the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum, Temple of Literature, War museum with the the real Mig-21 and B-52, Ceramic wall, Long Bien bridge, Tran Quoc Pagoda, West Lake, Hanoi Citadel, and various temples.I am extremely satisfied with the the service of Hanoi Vintage Vespa Tours. Bring your own personalized itinerary and let them guide you around Hanoi."

Four of us, each on the back of a scooter. The guys picked us up at our hotel, provided helmets, and we took off for about 4 hours. This was a great day trip. Included lunch in Hanoi. Stopped for coffee. Stopped at roadside market, fabulous photo ops! Stopped at a very old temple. Rode through rice fields on narrow paved trails wide enough for 2 scooters to pass. Our guides were very knowledgeable, eager to answer our questions. We went back to Hanoi for lunch, nice place, good food on a very narrow street. Apparently so narrow that one of our bikes was allegedly illegally parked. We watched what looked like local police carry that bike away along with my personal helmet. No worries. It all worked out. These guys were fantastic and excellent riders. Check it out!"

I stayed in Hanoi for 5 days and did the tour on my last day and still saw something new. We went around Hanoi when it got dark and seeing Hanoi at night was absolutely perfect. That is also a chance to get into the crazy Hanoian traffic without being scared of getting into an accident because the drivers drove really slow and save - that is also great for taking pictures and to look around!! Huy the guy who took us around spreak English very well and knows a lot about the sights we visited as well .. Just a unique way to get around in Hanoi so I highly recommend Hanoi Vintage Vespa Tours and it was definetly worth the money."

Hop on the back of a vintage Vespa and get one of the best tours of Hanoi! Get from place to place with ease as you wind your way through the city to see all of it's beautiful architecture \u2013 Temples, Churches, Local Markets, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, and other historic landmarks. The tour guide was great and provided us with so much information about the places we visited but also about the culture of Vietnam. All of the drivers were so friendly and shared their own personal stories and asked about our stories! My drivers name was Thien and he was awesome! Lunch was delicious, our whole group sat and ate family style. The waiter told us about each dish and even showed us how they prepare and eat spring rolls!My girlfriend and I were the only two doing the full day tour so we said our goodbyes to the group and continued on to the countryside. Open roads, rice fields, a 1000 yr old temple and some road side boiled corn rounded out what was an amazing and educational tour of Hanoi."

We were in Hanoi for a few days, and have walked in old quarter, taken a cab, but this tour by far was the best way to visit not only places in the Old Quarter but also in the other districts of Hanoi. Khang is very knowledgeable about the city and Vietnam in general, we got to talk about the history of Vietnam while stopped at many of the historical places on our tour. Definitely try this tour, you basically ride on the back of a vintage Vespa which is surprisingly comfortable and enjoyable. You get to see cool local street food places and quite a few historical sites as well.Lunch is included in the tour we picked, and it was a heavy duty lunch, not in a bad way either :) we had some great food and at the end of the tour Khang offered to take us to his coffee shop and serve us some fresh Vietnamese coffee, which was definitely one of the highlights of the trip."

The morning was spent in the countryside, visiting markets where we were welcomed as novelties by local people and we sat and ate at their stalls. On to temples, farms, paddy fields and vegetable gardens. We sat on little stools by the main road and ate sweet corn and we rode over Vietnam's longest bridge. This was followed by a really lovely lunch at a friendly restaurant. Then part 2! Through the city, round West Lake. More temples and a lap of the French Quarter. Although our time was probably up, it was no problem as we battled through the traffic of the Old Quarter and round Hoan Kiem Lake via the Opera House and back to our guesthouse at 4.30. Wow! Khang and Kai were brilliant. Really safety conscious, professional and confident. Very knowledgeable and full of great stories. I took so many photos that the battery was running low on my phone but Khang even had a power bank to re charge!! So, if you are wondering whether to go, it might sound pricey for a day (or half a day), but it's the best way to see and experience Hanoi and some neighbouring countryside."

Huy was prompt at arriving at the hotel and off we went through the morning craziness to get out to the countryside. To say I felt safe was an understatement as Huy is an accomplished driver. The countryside trip was amazing and I felt like I had every attraction to myself, because I did. We saw things including a 2000+ year old temple and Huy had an historical Vietnam fable to tell at every one which made everything so much more amazing. Then after an incredibly filling lunch and joining up with 5 others we hit the central Hanoi tour which was very special including a 1000 year old temple, a circumnavigation of West Lake and then the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. It was an incredible day, thank you Huy and I cannot recommend this adventure to anyone more highly as it was a highlight of my 3 month trip to Vietnam. Enjoy!!!!!"

A great genuine ride through Hanoi on a Vespa with a guide that speaks good English.\u00a0Riding on a scooter is much easier to manouver through the traffic, the guys are very good drivers.Explain and show everything you ask for, very detailed information about not only Ha Noi but Vietnam also.We went to a local place to have a fantastic lunch, and at night we experienced true Vietnamese food at a local restaurant.Thank you"

I wanted to see life in the countryside outside of Hanoi. First stop was the vegetable farms and I briefly helped some of the local farmers in their fields. They even offered to give me a job for $5 a day! After visiting a local market, I was then shown how they make rice paper. Next I was taken to observe local candy being made. After a delicious lunch with a local family we crossed the Red River on a local ferry and went on to a furniture factory. Most of the pieces on display were for temples, made by highly skilled craftsmen. This was such an interesting and varied trip that it is a must do while you are in Hanoi. I am 62 but had such a blast on the vintage Vespa. Khi and Katherine were brilliant, both very professional and knowledgeable. This was the icing on the cake of my stay in Hanoi and I would definitely recommend you try this."

We went on the night tour and had cancelled our day trip earlier just to save energy for this evening tour as we were promised a lot however there was not much delivered... The food was average, we had tasted better in the street food tour. We felt rushed about from place to place we couldn't relax in any one place that we were brought to. We weren't given any time to take photos nor was there any commentary at all from our tour guide Mr Khang who was more busy on whatsap throughout the duration of our tour rather than to ensure we were comfortable. It just made us feel like he wasn't interested and it was just a job to him where he wanted to complete the tour as soon as he could. We were told that there was a lot of food and unlimited drinks this is not the case the food is very limited (as we had to order room service when we got back) and the drinks were one if you even had enough time to drink it at one place.By the time we had got to the last bar (Swing in the French Quarter) he had indicated after my first drink that I would have to buy my own . I have no issue in this but he shouldn't advertise the tour incorrectly or mislead customers. But what really put a bad taste for us was the fact he didn't bother to provide much commentary on the tour however by the last leg of the tour he went on to tell my partner of how much he loved money for about the fifth time during the tour and that is why he was in the tour business which just made us feel uncomfortable. It was no wonder that this tour was rather expensive however he didn't take the time and effort and care to ensure he we had a good time or properly show us the city with some conversation. His assistant however was very nice and made a more of an effort. I think Mr Khang has a lot to learn if he wants his business to become a success. The nature of his business is that he has to be friendly and attentive with customers and not to make them feel like they are a burden. Mr Khang stay of your whatsapp at least for the duration of the tour\u2026that would be a step in the right direction!"

What a fabulous way to get a better feel for the city: weaving through the traffic, visiting areas we wouldn't have otherwise seen, hearing Khang's stories of Vietnam's history - all on beautiful vintage vespas. It is absolutely thrilling to be in the thick of the traffic. I felt 100% safe - despite how crazy the traffic looks, it is actually much more orderly than elsewhere. This tour (Insider Morning Tour) not only gives you a view of Hanoi, it is so much fun! I have no doubt that the After Dark tour would be great fun as well. Highly recommended."

We went to a rice paddy, vegetable farm, flower farm, and local market to try traditional Vietnamese foods you might not find in the city. We saw how rice paper is made, and Went to a local candy factory to see how the locals make sweets. After we tried stopped at aCafe for drinks and a local families house for lunch with fresh delicious traditional Vietnamese food (banana salads, meat and potato soup, spring rolls, \"jumping chicken, vegetables, fruit, rice and fried pork). Next we crossed the red River on a barge and drove to a furniture factory where we watched how they made incredibly intricate wood carvings. Then we rode into the urban part of hanoi, saw the apartments, and a laquer art gallery. The whole tour was about 6.5 hours in total. It was safe, fun, delicious and a great way to see the REAL Vietnam and how the locals live outside the city. Great tour!"

My husband was a little wary as at 46 he had never been on a scooter and had decided that Vietnamese traffic was crazy, but he soon felt at ease & safe when we were picked up at our hotel by Huy & Theo and the first thing he said at the end of our trip was 'can we do it again?'. Our first stop was the opera house, then past the mural wall, over the bridge and stopped for our first 'food' stop where we watched the sun set as we looked over the Red River and ate the BEST prawn & squid hotpot of our travels. We had lively and interesting conversations with our guides as we ate and got back onto the scooters and over the old bridge and passed the beautifully lit West Lake onto our second food stop where we really ate with the locals. Next we stopped at the cowboy bar where we enjoyed the 'house' band doing great covers of Ed Sheeran, Cyndi Lauper to name but two then onto our highlight the 'Swing' club where the singers were excellent. This tour was also an excellent way to see Hanoi lit up at night. We both wished that we had done this tour earlier in our stay in Hanoi as we would have done at least one of the day tours too. We cannot recommend Huy and his company highly enough - you can't fail to enjoy!"

We were picked up from our hotel and then had the most delicious fresh fruit in a wonderfully busy and bustling narrow side street we would have never known how to navigate on our own. To feel the wind blowing in your face as the lights and night life was harmonizing around you was unbelievable. Khang explained the historical significance of each sector of town. We then crossed over the river to have a seafood dinner- we had an assortment of seafood and river fish which was delicious. Vietnamese cuisine is an art form, and it was an honor to learn more about it. We then drove across the bridge and lover's lane back to town and to have Pho at a place where the local Vietnamese who live in Hanoi enjoy going. This was such a treat, and the Pho was beyond! We then cruised around town and saw families out enjoying the parks and beauty of the city, drove around the lakes and ended up at an American Western bar where we enjoyed some karaoke. Khang also sells weasel coffee at his shop, so we absolutely had to try some and loved it and of course had to purchase some for savoring at another time. Khang is dedicated to making a memorable experience for those who are up for an adventure and an in depth look at the life, pace, beauty, and colorful energy that makes Hanoi the amazing city that it is. We highly recommend the night foodie tour, although I'm sure any tour would be fantastic, Khang, and the Hanoi Vintage Vespa Tours company to anyone that is visiting or residing in Hanoi! C\u1ea3m \u01a1n Khang!"

I decided to book the 4 hr personalised Vespa tour but then the storm came and with it torrential rain. I made the call to push on and do the tour and I am so very glad that I did. If anything it was more fun and Khanh was an enthusiastic guide. You really feel part of Hanoi on the Vespa as opposed to a car or worse still bus - you can go anywhere and the travelling between points A to B. Is just as much fun as actually arriving. The lunch at Ying yang was great the team were very friendly and Khahn told some wonderful stories about the history of the area. I would highly recommend this and it represented great value too. Don't let rain put you off just embrace it as part of the adventure. Enjoy."

We spent 4 1/2 hours cruising around taking in some of the sights, also visiting a couple of local restaurants and bars. Sampling some local food, entertainment and Vietnamese night life. The tour included dinner at the chosen restaurants which was really tasty and a drink of your choice at each venue.

We then visited a couple of superb restaurants to eat which included drinks before moving onto a bar and swing club where again drinks included. The you took over 4'hours and did not feel rushed. We thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The only area which my wife pointed out was that her driver did not speak much English so she didn't have an opportunity to ask questions as we rode around. It did not spoil her evening however. Highly recommended & worth the money."

I would have preferred to drive my own scooter but so happy that I had a driver - Hanoi is not a place to try out your driving skills. Loved the Vespa! Khan has put together a great night program - very knowledgable about the history and sites. I really enjoyed getting out of the touristy old town to visit and eat and drink at some great local spots. The countryside tour was equally great except that it was extremely hot. Loved the market and cruising the countryside - I learned a lot about Vietnamese culture. My fault for picking the hottest time of the year to go. Highly recommend this tour company!"

They picked us up from our hotel and were so friendly the entire time. We rode around the streets and saw the sites and then stopped in at a lovely place for a delicious lunch (included). We rode across the bridge, saw heaps of suburbs you wouldn't usually see, temples, pogodas, lotus farms and all the while, Mihn would stop at various points and tell us really informative history tales of what we had seen and of the country and city. The bikes are awesome retro original vespers, and the riding was as safe as you could get in Hanoi. We had total confidence in them driving us around while we looked at the passing scenes of so much of the city, even during a tropical storm. Ponchos and drinks provided they took amazing care of us. Thank you guys so much for showing us parts of Hanoi we wouldn't have thought to see and are so glad to have seen! You guys rock, and being a new tour we really hope that people take our advice and book a tour with you guys to see the city with you. Book it now!!"

It's a great way to be introduced to the city, the food and daily life in Hanoi. Wish I had done it weeks ago as a way to get my bearings. Many thanks to Nga, our tour leader and to Tracey and Daisy. Great drivers and lovely guides :) We did three hours, 11am to 2pm. Be warned that they are incredibly generous on the food and won't stop until you are full! We consider ourselves great eaters, but by the 4th stop we needed to start sharing plates. We managed six great stops, working our way through an array of classic morning dishes, snacks, lunch/dinner meals and desserts. The tour had little extras (while you are digesting) like riding across Long Bi\u00ean Bridge, (a historic cantilever bridge across the Red River), wandering into the backparts of shops and into Old Quarter living areas) that you wouldn't usually get to see). Fantastic 3 hours, highly recommended. Nga also wrote down all our dishes so I could blog later, gave us her egg-coffee recipe and recommended a few other places for dinner (once we can eat again). One tip - the office is on a corner at 74 Hang Bac in the heart of the Old Quarter (the sign above says Kim's Tours). Easy to just book there, they speak English."

Her English is among the best I have encountered in Vietnam, which is especially impressive since she has never traveled to an English speaking country before. She took us to many different places and we were so stuffed towards the end of it that we had to ask to not eat anymore. She also knows a lot about history and was able to explain a lot of it while taking us sightseeing. She is very witty and also an excellent driver.Her friend that drove the other scooter (didn't catch her name) was very sweet. Her English was limited so we didn't get to communicate as much, but she was still an excellent co-pilot and safe driver. We did the 4 hour night tour, which I highly recommend as Hanoi livens up in a different way at night and many sight-seeing places light up. Come very hungry because you will be doing a lot of eating! PS - Don't be worried if you're scared of riding in the scooter at first. I love that type of stuff so I thought it was fun, but riding in Hanoi traffic can be overwhelming at first. Not to fret - Nga and her friend were completely in control of the scooter and I didn't once feel unsafe. Hold onto the bar at the underneath your seat if you want to feel more secure."

They even did a detour so we could see the B52 remains. We felt incredibly safe on the bikes. We were stuffed by the end of it as we tried so much food including desert. At the end of the tour, Phoenix wrote down a list of all the foods we had tried and the Vietnamese name for them"

I was picked up from My hotel by Sam and given my first invigorating experience on the back of a scooter through the streets of Hanoi and the Old Quarter, to the main office for payment. Then it was straight into the tour. Our tour, which was a small group, myself and a family of 3, was hosted by Money. I cannot recommend her enough. Considerate, thoughtful and extremely organised, and with one of our tour guests having a nut allergy, was on the ball with all the places we visited. All the food was FANTASTIC!!!!!! I cannot fault any of the dishes. Fresh, colorful and extremely tasty. Money explained all the food at each venue, it's cultural significance and how it may vary from the same dish in southern Vietnam. I won't go into detail of the food at each stop; it's nice to be surprised, but there is a great variety. The option for seconds is there, by all means take advantage, but I can guarantee it most likely won't be needed. Money will make sure you do not go home with an empty bellyMoney, Sam and the rest of the girls will keep you safe on the busy Hanoi roads and ensure you have a great experience of Hanoi. This tour is a great way to experience a part of Hanoi at night, and on the back of a scooter it's quite a bit cooler. Hanoi comes alive at night.......and with Money and her girls looking after you, it will be an experience that will live with you for ever. I had a fantastic time on this tour and can not recommend it enough to anyone who wants to see Hanoi in a different light. Thanks again Money!!!!!!"

All 4 bike drivers were university students or recent graduates, very polite and safe drivers. The drive across Long Bi\u00ean bridge to eat fresh clams by the river was a highlight for us, washed down with a home brew rice spirit. The egg coffee stop is really worth it. Pop out the back to see how they whip it up. Very typical of the ingenious can-do Vietnamese people! Loved everything we ate and went back to the bun cha restaurant for breakfast next day. Which is why you should do this tour early in your trip as you may want to revisit some places. "

All the places she took me were carefully planned and arranged so that we didn't have to wait much for every meal. I truly enjoyed the 4 hour food and highlights tour. It was really nice having breaks between food stops riding around the city. The pacing of the tour was perfect! I totally recommend it. It's a bit on the pricy side but worth every bit of it."

            "review": "Food safari on a scooter. Rocked up to the office planning to do the walking tour, but changed to the scooter at the last minute, despite missing the evening group they hastily organised a guide for the 3 hour gastronomic and visual tour of Hanoi. My guide Hien/Cherry was great, friendly and knowledgeable and most importantly an excellent and safe scooter driver. If you're larger than the average bear, ask for Cherry as her Honda Lead has a very comfy and large rear seat - which is far more comfy than the smaller bikes. Despite it being only the second time in my life on a motorbike, I felt completely safe and thoroughly enjoyed the ride through the city, the traffic wasnt that bad on a friday night and it was an awesome way to see the lights and sights with the cool evening breeze around you. Ditch the taxi or limo and dont hesitate to hop on the back of a scooter (but not from the dodgy looking touts that are all over the city offering rides), there is no better way to see and experience the sights at night. Havent done the walking tour but I would think the scooter is the far better option as you cover a lot more ground and get to see the sights. Do it on your first night in Hanoi as you will gain an excellent orientation of the city and it will help you get your bearings when you explore the city on your own later. The food was fantastic, some dishes you can find at your neighborhood vietnamese restaurant back home and others which are a little more exotic (like the egg coffee), but all delicious. Its always interesting to see the differences in taste and presentation etc between local and foreign versions of the same dishes - the bahn my, bo bia and modern pho were the highlights. The desert, a simple fruit, yogurt and rice combo was a refreshingly way to end the tour. Highly recommended, its an awesome way to see the night lights of the city, get your bearings around town, and have a monumental feed at the same time. Cherry was proactive and wrote down a list of all the food /stalls we went to and added a few more recommendations. Strangely, if you pay in USD it works out a little cheaper than the VND option (45 vs 1.035m), and credit cards incur a 3% surcharge which they should absorb really."

My husband and I had 2 young university students taking us around. We have never seen so many scooters in our entire life travelling those street. I explained to our guide that I was unfamiliar to bike riding as she took it very steady. It was great fun. We visited 7 street food locations and ate a variety of foods. To Europeans eating soup with noodles and spices is a bit strange for breakfast but hey we just went with it. Egg coffee is a little odd as well, very rich. We saw all the main sights and returned after 4 hours. By Vietnam standards, it is quite expensive, but we thought it was entertaining and fun so worth the money."

I had such a great experience that as soon as the tour was over, I immediately booked another one for the following night. I requested Nga and she/tour operator was very kind to accommodate me. On the second night, we went to different street vendors all across Hanoi and the food was just as terrific. Nga chose a series of foods/a menu that was varied, interesting and balanced. I savoured each bite, wanting to have more and knowing I won't be back in Hanoi for quite some time. Try to ask for Nga as your guide, they will try to accommodate, but I'm sure all of the guides are fantastic."

She provided us with information and recommendations about food and places to visit for our trips to other cities as well which we were greatly appreciative of - its always better when a local makes recommendations in a country where the language and culture is completely foreign to you. Given the sheer overwhelming amount of options in Hanoi for food, I'd definitely recommend getting started with this tour to get a head start on this wonderful city :)"

I would highly recommend the 3 hour tour and felt really safe at all times on the back of the bike, even in the rain... Well worth the money as you really get to learn about Vietnamese culture whilst eating dishes you probably wouldn't ordinarily order or even know about.

I had never been on one before! All four of the ladies were competant drivers and we all felt very safe at all times. We were all issued with a safety helmet as well.We were taken to 6 different places to eat. Each meal was different. Annie explained to us in perfect english what every dish was. They were all extremely tasty and of excellent quality. Annie and her friends took us to the different sight seeing areas as well where Annie gave us a talk on the history of each place. Extremely interesting.At the end of the trip Annie wrote down the names of all the dishes and the addresses of the places we visited. This would help us during our stay in Vietnam.Without this tour we would not have known what to eat and we would not have had so much fun on the back of a motorbike!!! Annie is so professional in what she does. I would recommend this 4 hour trip to everyone. DEFFINATELY NOT TO BE MISSED!!"

Special mention needs to be given to the walking tour to access Hanoi's popular street food and best dining spots. I recommend that you take this on your first day in Hanoi so that you could make a return visit to one or 7 of the top venues listed. It was all very well arranged as each item complemented the palate. It ended with beer and coffee, like a 7 course dinner on the go! We were all full by the time it ended.

In hindsight that was a pity since we could have easily spent more time with our 2 lovely tour guides: Money and Alice. And that brings me to the best part of the tour. Money and Alice were doing the driving while we sat on the back which - to be honest - was probably the smarter way to go, than vice versa. Especially Money is amazingly knowledgeable. She seems to know everyone by person and knows the streets like the back of her hand. It's also really fun chatting with both guides as their English is superb. Thus, you can easily chat the time away, while on the bikes or while eating. Money turned out to be a little fan of Lionel Messi ;-). So, while I was mostly busy wondering how there are so few accidents given their way of driving, Money magically navigates to all those nice spots to try the street food. And that brings me to the second best part of the tour. Hanoi is something else, also when it comes to street food. Finding it is the tricky part though. But in that department, Money is an expert. I won't go into details here but rest assured that you can trust those guides and just try everything they offer you. They'll ask for allergies etc in the beginning so that's taken care of right at the start. Last but not least, there was some sightseeing as well, which I really appreciated. Honestly, without those breaks in between I would have simply bursted due to all that good food. Money and Alice gave nice background information about everything we wanted to know. All in all, we'd do it again and time. I highly recommend doing any of those tours. Ask for Money and Alice as guides."

Lily and Mia picked us up from the hotel on their scooters. They were tiny and we are not, but they handled the scooters skillfully through the crazy streets of Hanoi. I was strangely comfortable on the back of the scooter racing through narrow alleys and crossing crazy intersections. The food part of the tour was also excellent. We eat a lot of Vietnamese food at home in Seattle, but we are rarely adventurous. We went to 9 different places and tried 15 different things. We were stuffed by the end. Everything we tasted was good, although we had our favorites. Lily was very funny with her mix of practiced jokes as well as many good ones on the fly. The other thing I really liked about this type of tour is that we got out of the Old Quarter and into areas that tourists don't normally go. She also mixed in sightseeing in between the food stops. We saw where John McCain crashed, the oldest pagoda in town, the government buildings, Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum, and the West Lake. Due to the thrill of the motorbike ride, the excellence of the food, the charming guides this was probably the best tour I have been on. Good job Lily, I hope you get your \"Miss\" title :)."

I booked a sightseeing/food scooter tour on the evening of my first day in Hanoi to get quickly acquainted with the city, and it was everything I could have hoped for and more! Money was an incredible guide: warm and friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, engaging and open. Her English is perfect and she shares interesting stories about the city and fascinating insights into Vietnamese culture. And the food! So tasty, so diverse, and the best way to jump into my travels and know what kind of food/treats I had in store. About the booking of the tour: the initial booking was smooth and informative. Upon receiving confirmation (I booked two weeks in advance), I was supposed to be all set with a pick up from my hostel at 6pm. When no one showed up, I called to check in, and was hung up on. I didn't know if the tour was happening - if someone was coming for me or not - which was very upsetting and frustrating. But Money was so sweet when she came to pick me up (the mix up was not her fault; it was the office/scheduling) that I couldn't possibly stay upset and quickly forgot about the hiccup. I would have given fewer stars because of the poor scheduling and awful customer service on the part of the office, but Money was so wonderful and the tour itself such a fantastic experience, that I had to give Money the five stars she deserves! Money, I can't wait to meet up with you again! Someday soon I want to do sightseeing/food scooter tour Part Two! :)"

Traveling on my own, I decided to book the tour so that I could see (and eat) as much as possible during my short stay in Hanoi. Nobody else booked the tour at the same time as myself so it ended up being a private tour, and I'm so glad it was - Money is the absolute sweetest! I felt completely safe on the motorbike, so nothing to worry about in terms of safety. And the food - YUM. We want to places that I never would have gone to on my own as some were really tucked away into the alleyways behind the food stalls. On top of that, riding on a motorbike through Hanoi is such an exhilarating experience. At the end of the tour, Money wrote down a list of all of the places we visited and what we are so that I could go back to those places the next time I was in town. This is hands down one of the best experiences I've had while traveling SE Asia and I will most definitely book it again next time I am in Vietnam. Highly recommended. Ask for Money as your tour guide and you will have an amazing time!! :)"

Our guide Amy was fantastic. The food we tried was delicious; pho, bun cha, chicken sticks wrapped in rice paper, a dessert and egg coffee. There was more than enough food! My only complaint is that we did not get to sample many of the more interesting dishes shown in TripAdvisor photos, such as the amazing looking seafood ones, and had some dishes we were not really interested in.

Hopping on the back of a scooter driven by a local is the best way to go. It's not a generic food tour either, it'll begin by your guide asking you about what you've had so far and/or what you like or would like to try. We had a magnificent 3-hours with Lily, Mia, and Jane. You needn't finish your food, you will undoubtedly be beyond capacity by the end of the tour. Biggest tip is to do the evening food tour.. it's too hot during the day, plus evening food is more savory. They wrote us a transcript of all the places we visited, with the dishes we got, at the end of the evening, but I would definitely consider doing this every single time I visit Hanoi. Also you'll get a little bit of local history during your ride if you're alert and paying attention.My absolute favorite was Bun cha for kebab rice noodles.Thank you, LIly Mia & Jane"

Same story with the foods. However, I don't know how to do either safely. Moni and Annie can take care of you on both accounts. Riding with an experienced Hanoi rider is a kick. Seeing what is going on from that side is so much fun and a totally different view. Even as a control freak who has never been a passenger on a bike as an adult, I felt comfortable and relaxed. I had no sense that they didn't know what was going on. Annie was cool, calm and collected when she wasn't mentioning that it was cold. Poor girl. It was down to 60 degrees or so and raining. Coming from Seattle it felt like a beautiful June day to me so it became a good source or harassing her which is perfect because they have a great sense of humor.The food was great. A huge variety was had. Instead of guessing at what was there, Moni had a great breakdown for each. And the volume... at the last stop I couldn't finish my Bahn Mi. Visiting Vietnam has been like visiting my wife's aunt who doesn't speak English except to tell me to eat more. These folks want you to enjoy their food and it's pretty darn good in terms of quality and taste. Take this tour and have an adventure in Vietnam that you'll otherwise miss. Seriously, you'd walk right by these places and their tiny fancy plastic chairs and have no idea what you would be missing. Just make sure you start this tour hungry. Like preparing for Thanksgiving hungry. You won't believe the volume of food these 90 lb girls expect you to eat."

Me and my buddy signed up and soon thereafter two girls and two scooters showed up to pick us up for the start of 3 hours of incredible fun! Helmet was provided and jumped on the back with the girls weaving in and out of the insanity to the first of many street food destinations ranging from pho to various crispy pancakes, duck egg (with a baby duck in it), zooming thru tiny narrow alley ways and onto broad boulevards to HoChiMinh tomb and gorgeous WestLake. The guides Lilly & Mia were masters of the scooter and nothing fazed them staring down trucks & buses who would dare challenge us. More than once we mounted the side walk to make progress; it felt like a James Bond chase at times! Not only that our guides were extremely witty and cracked jokes about the food, the traffic, the cops throughout. I have rarely been entertained so much in my live. The food, the traffic, the side streets of Hanoi, the amazing food, talking to wonderful people, the stunning scenery of Old Hanoi.

They picked up my wife and I at our hotel, we had a quick chat about likes and dislikes and our experiences in Hanoi, and off we went. 8 delicious courses (at 8 different street level places) and 3 hours later, we returned to the hotel, fat, happy and with 2 new Vietnamese friends. Go hungry - best to skip breakfast (and perhaps the previous evening's meal too!). They'll even write up a list of places and foods for you so you can go back, or brag to your friends. Only thing I would do differently? Go on their tour when we first arrived, so we knew where to go for the rest of our stay. Seriously - do this."

They not only came on time but took us all around the city and even spent more time than the three hours allocated. By doing it on scooters, you don't get tired on hot days and also move along a lot quicker and get to see all the highlights. As we were not interested in seeing the museums but really get a feel for the city, this was quick and perfect for us. The tour includes lunch but we opted to skip it for seeing more sights and just snacking on chilled coconut water, fruits and bo bia. The young ladies took us to the usual sights and even a 17km ride around the lake. We wanted to get the flavor of the fruit markets and the silk markets and were extremely happy that the way we could see the city in the limited time we had. Thank you Mia and Lily."

Money and Alice picked us up from our hotel and took us on a 4hour whistle stop tour of Hanoi taking in a few of the main sights and some lovely places to eat! My girlfriend was worried at first by the traffic but was soon used to the hooting of horns and weaving in and around the traffic.The stand out reason for giving this tour 5stars is down to one of the girls in particular and that was \"Money\". Her self taught English was excellent and her knowledge of Vietnams history, food and culture was impressive, and had us asking endless questions which always had an answer.

We would recommend this tour to be done your first day in Hanoi so that you can revisit some food places or ask our lovely guides for recommendations on certain type of food you'd like to try! It was a little hard ordering street food on or own prior to the tour as it is not easy to spot certain foods when you dont understand vietnamese or speak vietnamese, as we notice most street food vendors don't really speak english (at least for the few we attempted). We rode on the back of our guide's scooter and that alone was so much fun cruising around the whole city with a combination of sightseeing and food with the wind in your face! Our guides were very patient, professional, fun and speaks very good english. We learnt a lot on that day with them about Hanoi and food. Would definitely recommend this tour, and on your first day! We were deciding between walking tour vs scooter tour as the scooter costs quite a bit more, but never regretted it - the scooter ride itself was fun and the whole tour was effortless as it was quite hot and humid if we were to do it on foot.

They picked us up from the hotel and started touring on motorbikes to various places in the city, including the HCM memorial site, the old train track and local alley ways. We also stopped at multiple hidden local street-food places where we had a taste of Hanoi, everything from bahn xeo, bun cha, to egg coffee. The tour was a great way to see the city and experience the everyday life of a hanoian! Both Mia and Lily were very enthusiastic and were willing to share their everyday stories with us! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the authentic side of Hanoi!"

Memorable dishes were the bun bo nam bo, rolled pho, and of course the egg coffee.

Miss Moon did a fantastic job of teaching us of the history of the good and the shops that have had so much success for decades. Don't let the humble shop fronts deceive you. They turn out the most delicious dishes. I left with some great tips of eateries you'll never find in the tour guide books."

I can't remember her name, but she was a lovely girl. I did the hanoi night food walking tour with my husband. Our group consisted of a few other couples and 3 guys (brothers). The places we stopped at seemed authentically Vietnamese and had delicious food (except for that flavorless fish soup or whatever it was). Everything else was delicious and the tour was super fun and entertaining."

More food than you can eat is served as part of nearly 10 or so places and stops.Favs where the pork on a stick roadside, sugarcane drink and the egg coffee.Recommended.K"

On the recommendation of a very good friend, I booked the Hanoi Street Foods Tour for myself and three friends on our last day in Hanoi. My only mistake was not booking it on the first day.For 20 USD per person, we spent three hours eating like KINGS and getting a tour of Hanoi, to boot! I could not believe the amount of food were expected to eat! Our tour guide, Ms. Moon, had just graduated from University with a degree in English Tourism. She was fabulous. Though her accent is pronounced, her English is good. She is exceptionally knowledgeable about all things Hanoian, and she is funny. An excellent guide.Now, make no mistake. This is street food. You will be eating in (or in front of) establishments that you would normally pass by because with your western sensibility, you would be sure these places will give you dysentery or at the very least, Uncle Ho\u2019s Revenge. I am pleased to report that you would be wrong and Uncle Ho is laying revenge-free in his giant mausoleum.We met Ms. Moon at her office, which was just down the street from our hotel, The Oriental Central Hotel on Hang Bac street, in Hanoi\u2019s Old Town. She asked if we had any dietary restrictions and smiled when we said we had none.We must have eaten in at least 10 places, all of which are famous in Hanoi and were established between 25 and 70 years ago. We were the only westerners in each establishment, that\u2019s how good the food was. We ate:Bun Rieu Cua - Grilled mini-crab cakes in tamarind broth and rice vermicelliCha ca - Turmeric Fish with Dill SoupSpring rolls and fried Pillow Cakes - filled with pork and mushrooms and wonderfulnessFresh Water Chestnuts - Ever have one of those mealy, disgusting starchy things from a can? Be prepared to have your socks blown off. This little gem tastes exactly like fresh young coconut.Banh Xeo (Rice crepes filled with pork and mushrooms or with eggs) - you get to sit there and watch a woman spoon thin rice batter onto a silk screen and steam each crepe individually. Served hot with fish sauce.Bun Cha - Grilled Pork and Noodle SoupFried Banana in Rice PastrySpicy or Sweet Donut CakeEgg Coffee - Don\u2019t worry, just try it.Cold beerPho Ga - Sliced chicken in an anise and dill broth.My advice? Skip breakfast and book a 10 or 11 AM tour with Ms. Moon on your first full day in Hanoi. You won\u2019t be disappointed. And you won\u2019t need to eat again until the next day."

At 6 people, I think our group size was ideal and I wouldn't have liked it any larger since it was already a bit challenging to hear the guides over the street noise and we seemed to take over some of the places we visited as it was. The food itself was really tasty for the mostpart - we tried B\u00fan ch\u00e2, B\u00e1nh Cu\u00f4n, B\u00e1hn G\u00f4i-Nem Cua B\u00ea, B\u00e1nh Da Cua, green rice ice cream on a stick, egg coffee and egg beer. A bonus of the tour was finding out the \"real\" prices of these dishes at each establishment! One thing we might suggest...although we were given some instruction on how to eat most of the dishes, we would have benefited greatly from actual demonstrations by the guide(s)! There was more than enough food at each stop for the guide to use for a demo. It was really nice having the assistant Blue along to help herd and protect us at the back of the line and chat with us when Lucky wasn't accessible. Overall we thought the 3 hour tour was decent value for the $20 US (840.000 VND) and beneficial for identifying and ordering Vietnamese street food...we were stuffed!!"

The company's website says 6-10 people per trip, there were 15 of us and we had to miss out on one stall/shop because they didn't have room for us. It was also slightly too many to get close to our guide and hear what he was saying over the street noise. Our guide Phuoc was kind and quite informative but didn't ask if there was anything we particularly wanted to try and although we asked about some dishes he didn't stop to buy us any - unlike other reviewers have noted. We also didn't get a drink til the second to last place we went to, we were all very thirsty by then!Overall we weren't too impressed with the food we tried, we've been in Vietnam a while and had sampled most of it before -and were sad not to be 'wowed'. That's not the Tour's fault and we definitely went to places we would never have tried without a local with us, but we probably won't return to any of them just because they weren't anything special, for us."

            "review": "Past its prime. We had been in Hanoi for a week and we patiently waited for the street tour to start running again after the Tet holiday. Note: they raised their prices to $20 (USD) per person. We showed up for the 5pm tour, knowing it would be a big group, but had very high expectations due to the great reviews. After splitting us into two groups (which arguably should have been divided into three or four groups), eleven of us headed out with our guide Lucky. We had very little interaction with Lucky to start. He introduced himself to us but did not ask the group where anyone was from to try to encourage group interaction. Although a portion - seven of the eleven - were a grouchy family, which made it tougher on Lucky, he did not try much to engage any of us.We headed out in a straight line to our first stop for pho ga (chicken pho). This was bland and boring but a good way to start, by easing us into street food. Lucky did not eat with us. He explained the dish a little and then just let us eat. He never asked if anyone liked it. He just said, \"are you done? Let's go.\" So we headed to the next stop for b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n (rolled cake with mushrooms and pork). This dish was delicious and the stand out of the night for us. We then went to two other places and ended at the egg coffee which was very unique.My issues were the following:*Our group size was just too big to even try to stay together on the streets or sit together in the dining places / blue stools.*We ended our tour after only five places and just at 715pm...so we did not get three hours and we did not get the 6-8 places that all the other reviewers claim they had*Lucky gave us some cursory info on what we were eating but very little. *Lucky did not seem to want to interact with us at all. He stood away on his phone or just stood somewhere away from us while we were eating*Lucky did not even tell us anything about street food. We had hoped to learn what to look for and how to determine places you should try. We went on this tour to learn about street food but instead we just were led around to eat. We do not need a guide to do that for us and we certainly do not need to spend $20/pp for someone to lead us around.I know we had a difficult group but as a tour guide you have to at least try and make the experience pleasant for everyone.With all the great reviews, we expected so much more and we hoped to learn something about street food and Hanoi. However, we learned very little and it felt like it was a chore for Lucky to be taking us around. Perhaps this was just an off night but we still felt that we had to write an honest review. *If you are at all an adventurous person, you could create your own street food tour on your own for free! We did for the first week we were here.* Concentrate on the old quarter and L\u00fd Qu\u1ed1c S\u01b0 Street* Go to Pho 10 and where the crowds are."

There were about 7 or 8 different foods sampled, each at a different location, with each food fully explained (in terms of its ingredients and how you combine/eat the food). (NB: I'm a picky eater and tried & loved everything!)It was so relaxing to have the pressure off as to choosing where and what to eat. We just wandered and chatted (as we followed/walked with) our guide and enjoyed the atmosphere of what feels like street theatre - i.e. just watching the locals going about their day to day business.Our guide ( Phuoc) who is just 23 & works 7 days per week, was great. He explained everything about the food; gave us explanations about key historical facts; and also answered every possibly question we could think of about Vietnamese culture and his own personal routine & circumstances. I.e. he hopes to marry his girlfriend next year.Do go on this tour and after you've enjoyed it as much as we did, dont forget to tip generously.

We did a lunchtime tour our first day in Hanoi (and Vietnam) which was a wonderful way to get introduced to the crazy Old Town and the local food. We tried SO much food (come hungry!), including noodles, a soft rice/egg pancake, a tofu drink, sugarcane juice, spring rolls, fried 'pillow cakes' (which were a personal favorite), egg coffee, and fresh beer - bia hoi - which was delicious. All consumed on smaller-than-life, teeny tiny stools! Quite a workout for my 6 ft husband. This is the real deal experience, very local places that each serve pretty much just 1 thing. The food and drinks were delicious and we felt it was definitely worth the $15 cost. It would have been hard (especially on day 1) to track down all these places on our own. One highlight was that Ms. Moon is from the local area so she had actually grown up going to some of the vendors (eg, the noodle shop for special occasions with her family, or the tofu drink stand on schoolday afternoons)."

The three hour tour was too long for us, so they offered a two hour tour followed by an hour on cyclos back to our hotel. The three hour has 12 stops but we had 6. Unfortunately we were given a guide who hadn't read the website about the stroll and wander through the streets of Hanoi. He put on a cracking pace with the rest of us struggling to keep up with him in the crazy Hanoi traffic. At that pace you are just looking at where you are putting you foot down and who is about to run over you. Not much opportunity to look around.The guide spent much time on his mobile phone and occasionally gathered us together to tick the box of pointing out a local feature before taking off down the street with us struggling to keep up. Repeated requests from us to slow down had little effect.The street food was actually in little indoor eateries - off the street. None of the advertised outdoor barbeque stalls. Everything was very rushed as our guide waited for us to finish each course. The food was good and there was plenty of it. We were served up more than we could comfortably consume. The advertised egg coffee was one attraction we were keen to try but we wouldn't have had that if we didn't insist and he took us back to our first stop for that. On the website the coffee was to be served at a secret cafe where we would take in a spectacular night view of Hoan Kiem lake. We could see the four walls around us and that was about it which was probably the result of not taking the three hour tour.The cyclos were very comfortable and relaxing but the ride only lasted about 45 to 50 minutes which was enough because we were exhausted and were keen to get back to our hotel. Cyclos normally cost around $5 for an hour's ride. This part was actually Grandma's highlight because she could actually relax and take in the scenery without worrying where she was stepping.The tour price was too high, although the food was good, the experience was not enjoyable and we regret our decision to go on it."

In hindsight it would have been best to do it the first day, but better late than never! We sent a mail in the evening and got booked on for the next day at 11 AM.We were 5 people pluss our guide, Lucky.We got to taste a lot of different food, fruits and snacks in the small street restaurants. The tour were supposed to end at 2, but we kept going till 15.30, chatting over bia hoi. We can absolutely recommend this tour!!"

We did this trip on our second night in Hanoi at the beginning of our trip in Vietnam and are so pleased we did as I don't think we would have eaten street food if we had done it solo!If you love food and are prepared to try anything then you should definitely give it a go! Since being in Vietnam we have eaten in a variety of places at varying costs etc and the street food comes up trumps on flavour every time! This tour is well worth doing as an introduction and getting you past the apprehension of sitting on the road side with the locals; since doing this tour we have regularly had street food!Our guide Helen was brilliant and as well as taking as around the various food stalls explained about Hanoi culture and pointed out various different sights!We'll worth doing!"

My only regret was that I hadn't done this on the day we arrived in Hanoi so I could go back for more treats before I leave!!Our guide Ms Moon was awesome and she took that time to tell us about Hanoi, culture and food. We stopped at heaps of street food stores - ones that you'd never think to stop at, and we sat on little stools on the road side and ate bun cha, pillow cake, spring rolls, vermicelli, Vietnamese pancakes, sticky rice and more (my boyfriend and I counted about 12 different foods/dishes!). Our favourite was the egg coffee, imagine a meringue on top on coffee - it was so good!! Most of the places we went to were down alleyways that you'd never find or didn't have English signs so you'd have no idea what it sells so it was good to have a guide take us to the places renowned locally. For $15USD each we got a great guided walking tour with Ms Moon and tonnes of food. Definitely don't eat breakfast if you're planning on doing the 11am tour."

Our guide, Han was fantastic. it was a street food your but it went far beyond that with Han explaining about the streets, culture and having suggestions on what else to do in Hanoi.The food was unanimously great. We started with crab sausage w vermicelli, went through pillow cakes, spring rolls, fish w special vermicelli, a casava dessert, pancakes, bun cha plus sugar cane juice, beer and egg coffee. The variety was fantastic and it was all delicious. Highlight for me was the egg coffee and bun cha. I went in my own but was lucky enough to have another group of 4 Australians on the tour that made it a lot of fun. We left at 11am and the only regret was having a big breakfast beforehand. Also be prepared to walk about 5km and probably don't plan anything intense for that afternoon to give you a chance to sleep off the inevitable (but totally worth it) food coma that will follow."

Once you have settled into the crazy traffic and speed of life in Vietnam, then wandering around amongst the motorbikes and tooting cars all night will not be quite so daunting. The tour only takes about 10, so I suggest you email the company ahead of time to make sure you fit on. We started at 5pm had a friendly helpful guide called Ngam, (which means Money in English). Like others on TA, we found her great fun and she encouraged our group of 10 to try around15 to 20 different taste experiences from the street vendors. These little humble cafes were all places we would never have dreamed of sitting had we not been with her ( we often squatted down on little stools the street amongst the locals) Ngam explained lots about the foods we ate,Vietnamese customs and history as we walked around for 3 hours or so. We also met fun like-minded people on the tour.If you have an adventurous spirit and like seeing how the locals live and eat, then this tour is for you! At all you can eat for US $15, it's unbeatable value!"

And, it's for just USD 15/-. More than the price, it's the sheer zeal of he tour guide that makes the experience memorable! Keep up the good wrk, guys!"

Her English is very very good and she is very knowledgable. I cannot compare her to other guides but I would be asking for her!!!! Very very funny!!!!I cannot rate her and the tour high enough. IT IS A MUST DO. I was getting a bit over Hanoi, but once the tour started and dark fell my attitude changed.The food was great, places you would never stop. Foods you would never try. Plenty to eat, all included. She was open to new suggestions of foods guests wanted to try, and went above and beyond to find them. In our case, boiled (baby) duck eggs.Our other travelers were also very fun companions. The tour went overtime by over one hour, and Ngan also stayed for beer and doughnuts after the tour.BRILLIANT.

Beside Pho, I reaaly enjoy Bun Cha.Vietnamese cuisine has many different dishes to sample and some of these dishes originated in Hanoi. When you travel to Vietnam and visit Hanoi, you can enjoy traditional food in restaurants or road side stalls. Hanoi and its environment are the birthplace of many quintessential Vietnamese dishes, such as Pho and Bun cha. No less than Pho, bun cha is a typical dish which is preferred by both many tourists and the local people, from the usual days to holidays in Vietnam.How to make bun cha is simple, but to do a delicious bowl of bun cha - it depends heavily on the experience and traditional know-how, especially mixing sauces. Perhaps, thanks to such amazing sauce, it has made the essence of bun cha dish in Hanoi that is difficult for some where can get. Bun Cha is a combination of several ingredients: lemongrass grilled pork meatballs, lemongrass grilled pork, rice vermicelli and sometimes eggroll. The meat should be fresh and contain both lean and fat portions so that the grilled meat is not too dry. Meat must be soaked carefully and grilled on the charcoal until getting the special aroma.The soul of a Bun Cha dish is the sauce. A bowl of a good sauce includes chili, vinegar, salty and sugar tastes. When you enjoy the dish, you should add a little lemonade and some slices of papaya or carrot to the bowl of sauce. To make a good bowl of sauce requires skillful hands of the chief. Vietnam is one of the countries having a unique and multi traditional of cuisine. The unique is combined from traditional best Vietnamese food with cooking secrets, processing technologies. It brings not only delicious food, but also good for health. And Bun Cha Ha Noi is one of the most delicious foods which make many tourists to choose Hanoi as the next destination for their tours in Vietnam."

This street food tour completely made our trip to Hanoi. 3 hours of non stop eating and walking whilst taking in some culture and history of the city. Our first night we just wandered around trying different things but this tour totally made our visit there. We had a gorgeous little Vietnamese guide who spoke very good English and guided us through the craziness of the city, constantly stopping at little eateries and street food stands and shops. Places you wouldn't even know were there or think to go into, little stalls on the street, caf\u00e9s, beer hoi, food stands - everything. This is an authentic tour, non stop eating, hanging with the locals, everything paid for (including all the little bits and pieces she purchased along the way for us to try), all for $15pp. I've done some tours in Asia where the operator is clearly getting kickbacks from the establishments they take you to (think Thailand tuk tuks and gem stores), this is nothing like that. You ask about a food or something you see, she would just buy it for the group to taste and if she walked by something she thought we should try, we would go in.Awesome tour, so happy we came across it and booked it."

For a few hours I forgot that I was a tourist because of how authentic the tour felt. Miss Hang (our tour guide) was incredible and super sweet. If you ever get the opportunity to go on this street food tour, don't pass it up! For me, it was the experience of a lifetime."

If you're looking for a way to experience the real Hanoi and not just the usual tourist spots then definitely make some time in your schedule to do this. We met up with our tour guide Miss Hang at 5pm. From there started at Dong Xuam, which we were told was the city's biggest covered market. The place was amazing, buzzing with sellers promoting their produce. The smells certainly made me hungry. It was so hard to decide what to try! Our guide spoke great English and had expert knowledge about all of the different local foods on offer. She also gave us interesting historical information about the market and food, something we never would have learned without a local guide. My favourite was a fruit dessert that is a local tradition. When we wandering through the Old Quarter we got to see a mixture of street stalls and homes. It was a great way to experience a little of how the local people live. We finished the tour at a little gem of a caf\u00e9 with amazing views of Hoan Kiern Lake. Here we got to try a now hard to find local speciality of egg coffee while we got to sit and take in the atmosphere. We thoroughly enjoyed our tour. Everyone was so friendly and happy to tell us about their food and willing to share some great stories. I'm glad we took the evening tour, the lights and views were made even more amazing after the sun set."

Mr Phuocs hilarious translations made the sticky rice dumpling stand the highlight. Delicious. We both agree we'll go back and see him again. It was well worth it!"

Of course it wouldn't have been nearly as great without our English speaking tour guide, Mr Phuoc. He made sure we hit all the sights. He was obviously very knowledgeable but also made sure we all had a great time. and I think my favorite would have to be the barbecue stalls. YUMMY! If I ever go back to Hanoi I'm definitely taking street food tour through Kim Tours again. The local food was simply fantastic. My friends and I had a great time. I recommend this tour to anyone!"

            "review": "Amazing street food with Kim Tours. This is probably one of the best walking tours we have been on. Our English speaking guide Mr Phuoc, was outstanding, very knowledgeable and made our tour very enjoyable. My most enjoying part of the day trip was walking through the markets of the old Quarter, I really enjoyed this. Very lively with great markets to walk through. I found Mr Phuoc history tales about the 1000 year old very interesting and informative and you will learn a lot. We really enjoyed the \u2018BBQ\u2019 with the locals and the food was just out of this world, really tasty and different. One of my favourites being the fruit with crushed ice and the milk- this is one to try its just so nice!I also enjoyed being able to explore the area myself before the tour ended- it was nice to end the day trip being able to soak the atmosphere by ourselves. My only problem - I wanted the tour to last forever! Thank you to Mr Phouc for a fantastic day!Really recommend it, value for money and you will learn a lot of the Vietnamese culture and food."

They do not speak English but asking us to sit down and have a try. The lady then take out a VDN 20,000 note and point to all the food in front of her. We tried it and found that the food is delicious. The fried tofu, pork cake with the fish source is really nice. Must try in Hanoi for food street. It is the local food in Vietnam."
